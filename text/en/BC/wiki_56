<text>The laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) is a bird in the kingfisher subfamily Halcyoninae. It is a large robust kingfisher with a whitish head and a brown eye-stripe. The upperparts are mostly dark brown but there is a mottled light-blue patch on the wing coverts. The underparts are cream-white and the tail is barred with rufous and black. The plumage of the male and female birds is similar. The territorial call is a distinctive laugh that is often delivered by several birds at the same time, and is widely used as a stock sound effect in situations that involve a jungle setting.

The laughing kookaburra is native to eastern mainland Australia, but has also been introduced to parts of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Western Australia. It occupies dry eucalypt forest, woodland, city parks and gardens. This species is sedentary and occupies the same territory throughout the year. It is monogamous, retaining the same partner for life. A breeding pair can be accompanied by up to five fully grown non-breeding offspring from previous years that help the parents defend their territory and raise their young. The laughing kookaburra generally breeds in unlined tree holes or in excavated holes in arboreal termite nests. The usual clutch is three white eggs. The parents and the helpers incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. The youngest of the three nestlings or chicks is often killed by the older siblings. When the chicks fledge they continue to be fed by the group for six to ten weeks until they are able to forage independently.

A predator of a wide variety of small animals, the laughing kookaburra typically waits perched on a branch until it sees an animal on the ground and then flies down and pounces on its prey. Its diet includes lizards, insects, worms, snakes, mice and it is known to take goldfish out of garden ponds.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classed the laughing kookaburra as a species of least concern as it has a large range and population, with no widespread threats.

==Taxonomy==

The laughing kookaburra was first described and illustrated (in black and white) by the French naturalist and explorer Pierre Sonnerat in his &quot;Voyage à la nouvelle Guinée&quot;, which was published in 1776. He claimed to have seen the bird in New Guinea. In fact Sonnerat never visited New Guinea and the laughing kookaburra does not occur there. He probably obtained a preserved specimen from one of the naturalists who accompanied Captain James Cook to the east coast of Australia. Edme-Louis Daubenton and François-Nicolas Martinet included a coloured plate of the laughing kookaburra based on Sonnerat&#x27;s specimen in their &quot;Planches enluminées d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot;. The plate has the legend in French &quot;Martin-pecheur, de la Nouvelle Guinée&quot; (Kingfisher from New Guinea).

In 1783, the French naturalist Johann Hermann provided a formal description of the species based on the coloured plate by Daubenton and Martinet. He gave it the scientific name &quot;Alcedo novæ Guineæ&quot;. The current genus &quot;Dacelo&quot; was introduced in 1815 by the English zoologist William Elford Leach, and is an anagram of &quot;Alcedo&quot;, the Latin word for a kingfisher. The specific epithet &quot;novaeguineae&quot; combines the Latin &quot;novus&quot; for new with Guinea, based on the erroneous belief that the specimen had originated from New Guinea. For many years it was believed that the earliest description was by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert and his scientific name &quot;Dacelo gigas&quot; was used in the scientific literature, but in 1926 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews showed that a description by Hermann had been published earlier in the same year, 1783, and thus had precedence. The inaccurate impression of geographic distribution given by the name in current usage had not by 1977 been considered an important enough matter to force a change in favour of &quot;D. gigas&quot;.

In the 19th century this species was commonly called the &quot;laughing jackass&quot;, a name first recorded (as Laughing Jack-Ass) in &quot;An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales&quot; by David Collins which was published in 1798. In 1858 the ornithologist John Gould used &quot;great brown kingfisher&quot;, a name that had been coined by John Latham in 1782. Another popular name was &quot;laughing kingfisher&quot;. The names in several Australian indigenous languages were listed by European authors including &quot;Go-gan-ne-gine&quot; by Collins in 1798, &quot;Cuck&#x27;anda&quot; by René Lesson in 1828 and &quot;Gogera&quot; or &quot;Gogobera&quot; by George Bennett in 1834. In the early years of the 20th century &quot;kookaburra&quot; was included as an alternative name in ornithological publications, but it was not until 1926 in the second edition of the &quot;Official Checklist of Birds of Australia&quot; that the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union officially adopted the name &quot;laughing kookaburra&quot;. The name comes from Wiradjuri, an endangered Aboriginal language.

The genus &quot;Dacelo&quot; contains four kookaburra species of which the rufous-bellied kookaburra and the spangled kookaburra are restricted to New Guinea and islands in the Torres Straits. The blue-winged kookaburra and the laughing kookaburra are both widespread in Australia.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;D. n. novaeguineae&quot; (Hermann, 1783) – the nominate subspecies, east Australia, Tasmania and introduced into southwest Australia
* &quot;D. n. minor&quot; Robinson, 1900 – Cape York Peninsula south to Cooktown

==Description==
The laughing kookaburra is the largest species of kingfisher, outsizing even the giant kingfisher in body mass. It is a stout, stocky bird in length, with a large head, prominent brown eyes, and a long and robust bill. The sexes are very similar, although the female is usually larger and has less blue to the rump than the male. The male weighs , mean and the female , mean . They have a white or cream-coloured body and head with a dark brown stripe across each eye and more faintly over the top of the head. The wings and back are brown with sky blue spots on the shoulders. The tail is rusty reddish-orange with dark brown bars and white tips on the feathers. The heavy bill is black on top and bone-coloured on the bottom. The subspecies &quot;D. n. minor&quot; has a similar plumage to the nominate but is smaller in size.

The laughing kookaburra can be distinguished from the similarly sized blue-winged kookaburra by its dark eye, dark eye-stripe, shorter bill and the smaller and duller blue areas on the wing and rump. Male blue-winged kookaburras also differ in having a barred blue and black tail.

===Call===

The name &quot;laughing kookaburra&quot; refers to the bird&#x27;s &quot;laugh&quot;, which it uses to establish territory among family groups. It can be heard at any time of day, but most frequently at dawn and dusk.

This species possesses a tracheo-bronchial syrinx, which creates two sources of vibrations so it can produce two frequencies at the same time with multiple harmonics. The laughing kookaburras call is made through a complex sound production system, by forcing air from the lungs into the bronchial tubes. While the structure for producing calls is present from an early age, the kookaburra&#x27;s song is a learned behavior. The breeding pair within a riot of kookaburra teach the fledglings to produce the signature laughing call after the young have left the nest. The adult male will sing a short portion of the call while the offspring mimics this call, usually unsuccessfully. The singing lessons tend to last two weeks before the fledgling can properly sing and take part in crepuscular choral songs. Once mastered, the young can join in crepuscular chorus songs that aid in establishing territory.

One bird starts with a low, hiccuping chuckle, then throws its head back in raucous laughter: often several others join in. If a rival tribe is within earshot and replies, the whole family soon gathers to fill the bush with ringing laughter. The laughing chorus has 5 variable elements: 1. &quot;Kooa&quot;; 2. &quot;Cackle&quot;; 3. &quot;Rolling&quot;, a rapidly repeated &quot;oo-oo-oo&quot;; 4. Loud &quot;Ha-ha&quot;; followed by 5. Male&#x27;s call of &quot;Go-go&quot; or female&#x27;s call of &quot;Gurgle&quot;. Hearing kookaburras in full voice is one of the more extraordinary experiences of the Australian bush, something even locals cannot ignore; some visitors, unless forewarned, may find their calls startling.

Those calls are produced to attract/guard mates, establish and maintain the social hierarchy, and declare and defend a territory, as their calls are more often correlated with aggressiveness. Calls are utilized as neighbour/kin recognition to exhibit that groups are still inhabiting a territory. These calls also demonstrate to receivers that highly coordinated groups are of better quality and health. Acoustic communication between laughing kookaburras increases 2–3 months before the breeding season, September to January, because male aggression also increases.

The duetting call requires higher levels of cooperation within the group. The coordination of calls amongst kookaburras has been hypothesized to strengthen the main long-term pair bond and may have evolved as a mechanism to solidify the group&#x27;s bonds since it is energetically costly to learn a new song. Neighbouring groups exhibit degrees of cooperation as well since chorus songs between neighbours are delivered without any overlap, alternating between groups.

==== Other forms of acoustic communication ====
Squawking is another common form of acoustic communication in &quot;D. novaeguineae&quot; that is used in a slew of different contexts. Laughing kookaburras have been noted to squawk when nesting, exhibiting submissive behavior, and when fledglings are waiting to be fed. Laughing kookaburras have a greater repertoire of calls than other kookaburra species like the Blue-winged kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo leachii&quot;) that produces two simple types of calls: “barks” and “hiccups”. This large range of calls is highlighted through cadencing, intonation, and frequency modulations that allow more detailed information to be conveyed.

==Distribution and habitat==
The laughing kookaburra is native to eastern Australia and has a range that extends from the Cape York Peninsula in the north to Cape Otway in the south. It is present on both the eastern and the western sides of the Great Dividing Range. In the south the range extends westwards from Victoria to the Yorke Peninsula and the Flinders Ranges in South Australia.

It has been introduced into many other areas probably because of its reputation for killing snakes. In December 1891, the Western Australian parliament included &#x27;Laughing Jackass&#x27; in the schedule of strictly preserved Australian native birds in the Game Bill, moved by Horace Sholl, member for North District. He described it as native of the North West. His nomination is, therefore, certainly a reference to the blue-winged kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo leachii&quot;), not the laughing kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo novaeguineae&quot;). &quot;The Game Act, 1892&quot; (Western Australia), &quot;An Act to provide for the preservation of imported birds and animals, and of native game,&quot; provided that proclaimed Australian native birds and animals listed in the First Schedule of the Act could be declared protected from taking. Laughing Jackass was one of 23 Australian native bird species named in the schedule. 

Laughing kookaburras from Eastern States were released to the South West as early as 1883, with birds being noted between Perth and Fremantle, as well as up in Mullewa around 1896. The Acclimatization Society (or Animal and Bird Acclimatization committee of WA) imported and released hundreds of birds between 1897 and 1912. Mainly via Ernest Le Souef who was Secretary of the Acclimatization Society and Director of Perth Zoological Gardens, an enthusiastic supporter of the Kookaburra who admitted to releasing hundreds from the Zoo, including 50 in 1900 at the Royal request of the visiting Duke of York.

By 1912 breeding populations had been established in a number of areas. The present range in Western Australia is southwest of a line joining Geraldton on the west coast and Hopetoun on the south coast. In Tasmania the laughing kookaburra was introduced at several locations beginning in 1906. It now mainly occurs northeast of a line joining Huonville, Lake Rowallan, Waratah and Marrawah. It was introduced on Flinders Island in around 1940, where it is now widespread, and on Kangaroo Island in 1926.

In the 1860s, during his second term as governor of New Zealand, George Grey arranged for the release of laughing kookaburras on Kawau Island. The island lies in the Hauraki Gulf, about north of Auckland on the North Island of New Zealand. It was thought that the introduction had been unsuccessful but in 1916 some birds were discovered on the adjacent mainland. It now breeds in a small region on the western side of the Hauraki Gulf between Leigh and Kumeū.

The usual habitat is open sclerophyll forest and woodland. It is more common where the understory is open and sparse or where the ground is covered with grass. Tree-holes are needed for nesting. It also occurs near wetlands and in partly cleared areas or farmland with trees along roads and fences. In urban areas it is found in parks and gardens. The range of the laughing kookaburra overlaps with that of the blue-winged kookaburra in an area of eastern Queensland that extends from the Cape York Peninsula south to near Brisbane. Around Cooktown the laughing kookaburra tends to favour areas near water while the blue-winged kookaburra keeps to drier habitats.

A single individual Laughing Kookaburra, has been living wild, in Suffolk, in the UK, since at least 2015, being most recently sighted in 2024. Additional sightings of laughing kookaburras have been recorded in Scotland, suggesting that individuals of the species may be being intentionally or accidentally released.

==Behaviour==

Kookaburras occupy woodland territories (including forests) in loose family groups, and their laughter serves the same purpose as a great many other bird calls—to mark territorial borders. Most species of kookaburras tend to live in family units, with offspring helping the parents hunt and care for the next generation of offspring.

===Breeding===

During mating season, the laughing kookaburra reputedly indulges in behaviour similar to that of a wattlebird. The female adopts a begging posture and vocalises like a young bird. The male then offers her his current catch accompanied with an &quot;oo oo oo&quot; sound. However, some observers maintain that the opposite happens – the female approaches the male with her current catch and offers it to him. Nest-building may start in August with a peak of egg-laying from September to November. If the first clutch fails, they will continue breeding into the summer months.

The female generally lays a clutch of three semi-glossy, white, rounded eggs, measuring , at about two-day intervals. Both parents and auxiliaries incubate the eggs for 24–26 days. Hatchlings are and , fledging by day 32–40. If the food supply is not adequate, the third egg will be smaller and the third chick will also be smaller and at a disadvantage relative to its larger siblings. Chicks have a hook on the upper mandible, which disappears by the time of fledging. If the food supply to the chicks is not adequate, the chicks will quarrel, with the hook being used as a weapon. The smallest chick may even be killed by its larger siblings. If food is plentiful, the parent birds spend more time brooding the chicks, so the chicks are not able to fight.

===Feeding===

Kookaburras hunt much as other kingfishers (or indeed Australasian robins) do, by perching on a convenient branch or wire and waiting patiently for prey to pass by. Common prey include mice and similar-sized small mammals, a large variety of invertebrates (such as insects, earthworms and snails), yabbies, small fish, lizards, frogs, small birds and nestlings, and most famously, snakes. Small prey are preferred, but kookaburras sometimes take large creatures, including venomous snakes, much longer than their bodies. When feeding their young, adult laughing kookaburras will make “Chuck calls”, which are deep, guttural calls that differ significantly from their daily chorus songs.

=== Visual displays ===
To further enhance territorial behavior, kookaburras will partake in two types of aerial displays: trapeze and circular flights. Trapeze flights are aptly named after the swooping motion that neighbouring kookaburras will make towards one another in midair when defending territory. During trapeze flights, an individual from each riot will perch on branches bordering the others&#x27; territory and fly back and forth between trees within their established home range and trees bordering neighbouring kookaburras territory. These displays have been observed to last up to a half an hour and are usually accompanied by calls from the sender and members of that individual&#x27;s riot. Circle flights are initiated when an individual circumnavigates a neighbouring territory by flying over the area and then quickly invading neighbouring territory. Once inside the neighbouring territory, the individual will fly in circles around the other kookaburras inhabiting the area, which results in a typical laughing call or squawking depending on whether the neighbours&#x27; dominance status. Flight displays are useful for communicating over long distances, but other forms of visual signals can be effective for short-range communication.

Close range visual signals can be used to convey aggression or indicate incoming threats to the flock. Aggressive posturing is used as a warning before attacking, a signal that is commonly received by foreign kookaburras encroaching on another groups&#x27; territory. Laughing kookaburras will splay out their wings and propel their head forward while shaking their tail feathers to exhibit dominance and ward off intruders. The aggressive posturing is followed up by chasing off the unwanted individual before attacking. Visual displays are also used to communicate vigilance and the presence of threats via alert postures. &quot;D. novaeguineae&quot; will open its beak, ruffle up the feathers surrounding its cap, and angle their heads towards the direction of the threat. Depending on the urgency of the threat, alarm postures may be followed by loud laugh-like calls to warn other members of the flock.

==Relationship with humans==

Laughing kookaburras are a common sight in suburban gardens and urban settings, even in built-up areas, and are so tame that they will often eat out of a person&#x27;s hands, and allow them to rub their bellies. It is not uncommon for kookaburras to snatch food out of people&#x27;s hands without warning, by swooping in from a distance. People often feed them pieces of raw meat. Laughing kookaburras are often kept in zoos.

The kookaburra is also the subject of a popular Australian children&#x27;s song, the &quot;Kookaburra&quot; which was written by Marion Sinclair in 1934.

Recordings of this bird have been edited into Hollywood movies for decades, usually in jungle settings, beginning with the Tarzan series in the 1930s, and more recently in the film &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997).

==Conservation status==

The population density of the laughing kookaburra in Australia varies between 0.04 and 0.8 birds/ha depending on the habitat. Assuming an average of 0.3 birds/ha the total population may be as large as 65 million individuals. However, this may represent a severe over-estimate since the population of the laughing kookaburra seems to be undergoing a marked decline with Birdata showing a 50% drop in sightings from 2000 to 2019, and a drop in the reporting rate from 25% to 15% over the same period. The population in New Zealand is relatively small and is probably less than 500 individuals. Given the extended range and the large stable population, the species is evaluated as of &quot;least concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

<text>The blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii) is a large species of kingfisher native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea.

Measuring around , it is slightly smaller than the more familiar laughing kookaburra. It has cream-coloured upper- and underparts barred with brownish markings. It has blue wings and brown shoulders and blue rump. It is sexually dimorphic, with a blue tail in the male, and a rufous tail with blackish bars in the female.

==Taxonomy==
The blue-winged kookaburra was first collected by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, but was initially overlooked and confused with the laughing kookaburra, and was finally officially described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1826, its specific name commemorating British zoologist William Elford Leach. It is one of four members of the genus &quot;Dacelo&quot; which are commonly known as kookaburras. Alternative common names include barking or howling jackass, or Leach&#x27;s kookaburra.

The number of subspecies is unclear - with four recognised by most authorities, although others have proposed that the three Australian subspecies gradually change across Australia and should be treated as one.
*&quot;D. l. leachii&quot; is the nominate subspecies, found from Brisbane to Broome.
*&quot;D. l. cervina&quot; is found on Melville Island and the adjacent mainland.
*&quot;D. l. cliftoni&quot; is found in the Pilbara and Hamersley regions of northwestern Australia.
*&quot;D. l. intermedia&quot; is found in southern New Guinea.

==Description==
The adult blue-winged kookaburra measures around in length and weighs 260 to 330 g. Compared to the related laughing kookaburra, it is smaller, lacks a dark mask, has more blue in the wing, and has striking white eyes. It has a heavier bill than its larger relative. The head and underparts are cream-coloured with brownish streaks. It is sexually dimorphic, with a blue tail in the male, and a rufous tail with blackish bars in the female. Immature birds have more prominent brown bars and marks in their plumage, giving a &quot;dirty&quot; appearance, and their eyes are predominantly brown for the first two years of life.

Their call has been described as a maniacal cackling or barking.

==Distribution and habitat==
The blue-winged kookaburra has a distribution from southern New Guinea and the moister parts of northern Australia, to the vicinity of Brisbane in southern Queensland across the Top End, and as far down the Western Australian coast as the Shark Bay area. It does not occur between Broome and Port Hedland in northwestern Australia. Widespread and common throughout its large range, the blue-winged kookaburra is evaluated as of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 
Found in family groups of up to 12 individuals, it lives in open savannah woodland and &quot;Melaleuca&quot; swamps, as well as farmlands such as sugarcane plantations.

==Feeding==
The blue-winged kookaburra hunts and eats a great variety of animals that live on or close to the ground. In the summer wet season, insects, lizards and frogs make up a higher proportion of their diet, while they eat arthropods such as crayfish, scorpions, and spiders, as well as fish, earthworms, small birds and rodents at other times. They have even been recorded waiting for and snatching insects flushed out by bushfires.

==Breeding==
The blue-winged kookaburra is a co-operative breeder, a group being made up of a breeding pair and one or more helper birds that help raise the young. Breeding occurs once a year in late spring (September to December). The nest is a hollow high up in a tree, often or so above the ground. Three or four white, slightly shiny eggs, measuring or a little larger, are laid. The female incubates the eggs around 26 days, and nestlings spend another 36 days in the nest before fledging. Chicks are born pink, blind, and naked (i.e. ), and break their way out of the egg with an egg tooth on the bill. Feathers appear by 7 days and their eyes open from the 10th day onwards. Kookaburra hatchlings are often highly aggressive in the first week of life, and the youngest chick is often killed by the older chicks during this period. Once fledged, juvenile birds must be taught how to hunt by their parents for a further 6–10 weeks before they can properly fend for themselves.

==Threats==
The red goshawk and rufous owl prey upon the blue-winged kookaburra. Adult birds are also slow flyers and vulnerable to being hit by cars on country roads. Nests are susceptible to raids by olive pythons, quolls, and goannas.

<text>LaGuardia Airport ( ) – colloquially known as LaGuardia or simply LGA – is a civil airport in East Elmhurst, Queens, New York City, situated on the northwestern shore of Long Island, bordering Flushing Bay. Covering , the facility was established in 1929, and began operating as a public airport in 1939. It is named after Fiorello H. La Guardia, a former mayor of New York City.

The airport accommodates airline service primarily to domestic, but also to limited international destinations. , it was the third-busiest airport in the New York metropolitan area behind Kennedy and Newark airports, and the 19th-busiest in the United States by passenger volume. The airport is located directly to the north of the Grand Central Parkway, the airport&#x27;s primary access highway. While the airport is a hub for both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, commercial service is strictly governed by unique regulations including a curfew, a slot system, and a &quot;perimeter rule&quot; prohibiting most nonstop flights to or from destinations greater than .

Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, LaGuardia was criticized for its outdated facilities, inefficient air operations, and poor customer service metrics. In response, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) in 2015 announced a multibillion-dollar reconstruction of the airport&#x27;s passenger infrastructure, which was completed in January 2025.

==History==
===Original site===

Prior to human development, the coastlines of Bowery Bay and Flushing Bay converged at a natural point that comprised the eventual northern shoreline of Newtown, Queens. By 1858, the area was partially contained by the estate of Benjamin Pike Jr. based around what is today known as the Steinway Mansion, which was soon purchased and consolidated with other property by William Steinway. In June 1886, Steinway opened a summer resort development known as Bowery Bay Beach on the peninsula. Originally featuring a bathing pavilion, beach, lawns, and boathouse, the resort was renamed North Beach and later expanded with the addition of Gala Amusement Park. By the turn of the century, North Beach&#x27;s German-influenced development drew comparisons to Brooklyn&#x27;s Coney Island. Its fortunes soon turned, however, as Prohibition in the United States and war-related anti-German sentiment presented significant challenges to the resort&#x27;s profitability. These factors, combined with increased industrialization and pollution of the Queens waterfront, made the area untenable as a leisure destination, and it was abandoned at some point in the 1920s.

===North Beach Airport===
In April 1929, New York Air Terminals, Inc., announced plans to open a private seaplane base at North Beach later that summer. The facility was christened on June 15 and initially featured a concrete plateau connected to the water by a amphibious aircraft ramp, with the former resort converted to a passenger terminal. Opening-day festivities for the new airport were attended by a crowd of 5,000, and included air races with Curtiss Seagulls and Sikorsky flying boats, a dedication address by Borough President George U. Harvey, and the commencement of airline service to Albany and Atlantic City by Coastal Airways and Curtiss Flying Service. One month later, service to Boston was launched using Savoia-Marchetti S.55 aircraft operated by Airvia.

===Glenn H. Curtiss Airport===
By 1930, the airport had been improved with hangars and night-illuminated runways, and it housed seaplanes of the recently reorganized New York City Police Department Aviation Unit. On September 23, the site was renamed Glenn H. Curtiss Airport in honor of the New York aviation pioneer who had died one month earlier (not to be confused with the pre-existing Curtiss Field in nearby Garden City, nor a similarly renamed airport in Valley Stream). In a ceremony that same day, representatives from the forerunner to Trans World Airlines announced their bid to establish the nation&#x27;s first transcontinental airmail route to the airport using Ford Trimotors; in attendance were Eleanor Roosevelt and Charles Lindbergh.

On August 27, 1931, the airport welcomed the arrival of the world&#x27;s then-largest airplane, the Dornier Do X, after a 10-month transatlantic journey. Over 18,000 people visited the huge flying boat on its first day of static display, and it remained in the city for nine months. While the Do X was ultimately a commercial failure, its presence demonstrated the viability of long-distance air travel terminating a mere 20-minute drive from Manhattan. Likewise, this centralized location also enabled the airport to host hourly air taxi services between Newark and Brooklyn&#x27;s Floyd Bennett Field that September.

While Curtiss Field was quickly becoming a magnet of aviation, Newark Airport remained the primary terminal for New York City-bound passengers and mail. The city&#x27;s lack of its own central airport lingered as the 1930s wore on, especially as discussion grew regarding the commercial viability of privately operated fields.

===Municipal Airport 2===

The 1934 election of mayor Fiorello La Guardia ushered in a new era of public investment in New York City&#x27;s airports. LaGuardia had been a long-time aviation advocate; in a 1927 editorial penned while serving as a US representative of New York, he criticized both the federal and state governments&#x27; slow progress in establishing municipal airports in the city. Although several potential sites had been identified, LaGuardia mainly pushed for the transformation of Governors Island into a combined airport and seaplane base. &quot;No greater monument to the life and activity of the Republic can be imagined,&quot; he wrote, painting it as a teeming transportation hub at the extreme center of the city. Military and shipping concerns eventually shut down the proposal, but LaGuardia and industry leaders maintained consensus that New York City needed a central &quot;express&quot; airport to complement the farther-flung Floyd Bennett Field, which it completed in 1930.

While the Governors Island proposal was being litigated, LaGuardia also saw development potential in Curtiss Airport. Under his administration, the city entered a five-year contract with its owners, agreeing to lease the field for $1 per year, with an option to purchase the property for $1,500,000 (). The airport was officially dedicated Municipal Airport 2 on January 5, 1935. At a key ceremony that day, LaGuardia also received a signed lease from Trans World Airlines (TWA) for hangar space at Floyd Bennett Field—making it the first major US airline to serve New York City directly. While years would pass before TWA arrived at North Beach, LaGuardia had begun fulfilling one of his ultimate goals - extracting New York City from &quot;the humiliating position of seeing all its passengers and mail traffic go to a nearby state.&quot;

===LaGuardia Airport===
The initiative to develop the airport for commercial flights began with an outburst by New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia (in office from 1934 to 1945) upon the arrival of his TWA flight at Newark Airport – the only commercial airport serving the New York City region at the time – as his ticket said &quot;New York&quot;. He demanded to be taken to New York, and ordered the plane to be flown to Brooklyn&#x27;s Floyd Bennett Field, giving an impromptu press conference to reporters along the way. He urged New Yorkers to support a new airport within their city.

American Airlines accepted LaGuardia&#x27;s offer to start a trial program of scheduled flights to Floyd Bennett, although the program failed after several months because Newark&#x27;s airport was closer to Manhattan. La Guardia went as far as to offer police escorts to airport limousines in an attempt to get American Airlines to continue operating the trial program.
During the Floyd Bennett experiment, LaGuardia and American executives began an alternative plan to build a new airport in Queens, where it could take advantage of the new Queens–Midtown Tunnel to Manhattan. The existing North Beach Airport was an obvious location, but much too small for the sort of airport that was being planned. With backing and assistance from the Works Progress Administration, construction began in 1937, it is on the waterfront of Flushing and Bowery Bays in East Elmhurst, and borders the neighborhoods of Astoria and Jackson Heights. Building on the site required moving landfill from Rikers Island, then a garbage dump, onto a metal reinforcing framework. The framework below the airport still causes magnetic interference on the compasses of outgoing aircraft; signs on the airfield warn pilots about the problem.

Because of American&#x27;s pivotal role in the development of the airport, LaGuardia gave the airline extra real estate during the airport&#x27;s first year of operation, including four hangars, which was an unprecedented amount of space at the time. American opened its first Admirals Club (and the first private airline club in the world) at the airport in 1939. The club took over a large office space that had previously been reserved for the mayor, but he offered it for lease following criticism from the press, and American vice president Red Mosier immediately accepted the offer.
The airport was dedicated on October 15, 1939, as the New York Municipal Airport, and opened for business on December 2 of that year. The modest North Beach Airport was transformed into a 550-acre (220-ha) state-of-the-art facility at a cost of $23 million to New York City. Not everyone shared La Guardia&#x27;s enthusiasm for the project; some thought it was a $40 million waste of money. However, the concept of air travel itself captivated the public, and thousands of people went to the airport to see the planes take off and land in exchange for a dime. After two years, these fees and the parking they generated had already brought in $285,000. In addition, a total of $650,000 was made annually from non-travel-related sources such as restaurants. The airport was soon a financial success. A smaller airport in nearby Jackson Heights, Holmes Airport, was unable to prevent the expansion of the larger airport, and closed in 1940.

Newark Airport began renovations, but could not keep up with the new Queens airport, which &quot;TIME&quot; called &quot;the most pretentious land and seaplane base in the world&quot;. Even before the project was completed, LaGuardia had won commitments from the five largest airlines (Pan American Airways, American, United, Eastern Air Lines, and Transcontinental and Western Air) to begin using the new field as soon as it opened. Pan Am&#x27;s transatlantic Boeing 314 flying boats moved to La Guardia from Port Washington in 1940. During World War II, the airport was used to train aviation technicians and as a logistics field. Transatlantic landplane airline flights started in late 1945; some continued after Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy International) opened in July 1948, but the last ones shifted to Idlewild in April 1951.

Newspaper accounts alternately referred to the airfield as New York Municipal Airport and LaGuardia Field until the modern name was officially applied when the airport moved to Port of New York Authority control under a lease with New York City on June 1, 1947.

LaGuardia opened with four runways at 45°-degree angles to each other, the longest (13/31) being . Runway 18/36 was closed soon after a United DC-4 ran off the south end in 1947; runway 9/27 (4,500 ft) was closed around 1958, allowing LaGuardia&#x27;s terminal to expand northward after 1960. Around 1961, runway 13/31 was shifted northeastward to allow construction of a parallel taxiway (such amenities being unknown when LGA was built), and in 1965–66, both remaining runways were extended to their present .

The April 1957 &quot;Official Airline Guide&quot; shows 283 weekday fixed-wing departures from LaGuardia: 126 American, 49 Eastern, 33 Northeast, 31 TWA, 29 Capital, and 15 United. American&#x27;s flights included 26 nonstops to Boston and 27 to Washington National (mostly Convair 240s). Jet flights (United 727s to Cleveland and Chicago) started on June 1, 1964.
Although LaGuardia was a large airport for the era in which it was built, it soon became too small. Starting in 1968, general-aviation aircraft were charged heavy fees to operate from LaGuardia during peak hours, driving many LGA operators to airports such as Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey. The increase in traffic at LaGuardia and safety concerns prompted the closure of nearby Flushing Airport in 1984. Also in 1984, to further combat overcrowding at LGA, the Port Authority instituted a Sunday-thru-Friday &quot;perimeter rule&quot; banning nonstop flights from LaGuardia to cities more than away; at the time, Denver was the only such city with nonstop flights, and it became the only exception to the rule. (In 1986, Western Airlines hoped to fly 737-300s nonstop to Salt Lake City, and unsuccessfully challenged the rule in federal court.) Later, the Port Authority also moved to connect JFK and Newark Airport to regional rail networks with the AirTrain Newark and AirTrain JFK, in an attempt to make these more distant airports competitive with LaGuardia. In addition to these local regulations, the Federal Aviation Administration also limited the number of flights and types of aircraft that could operate at LaGuardia.

LaGuardia&#x27;s traffic continued to grow. By 2000, the airport routinely experienced overcrowding delays, many more than an hour long. That year, Congress passed legislation to revoke the federal traffic limits on LaGuardia by 2007. The reduced demand for air travel following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City quickly slowed LaGuardia&#x27;s traffic growth, helping to mitigate the airport&#x27;s delays. Ongoing Port Authority investments to renovate the Central Terminal Building and improve the airfield layout have also made the airport&#x27;s operations more efficient in recent years.

The FAA approved instrument departure procedure &quot;Whitestone Climb&quot; and the &quot;Expressway Visual Approach to Runway 31&quot;. When adopting the Expressway Approach, when the aircraft crosses the intersection of the Brooklyn Queens Expressway and the Long Island Expressway in Long Island City, it turns northeast on 85° and follows the Long Island Expressway, after reaching Flushing Meadow Park, the aircraft executes a 135° left turn over the Flushing Bay and joins the final approach to the runway 31. When adopting Whitestone Climb, aircraft circle over Flushing and head to Whitestone Bridge on the north upon takeoff from runway 13. Such patterns aim to reduce the noise, avoid the traffic of the JFK Airport, and maximize the air-traffic capacity in the New York TRACON. LGA and JFK approach airspaces borders around the Belmont Park.

In late 2006, construction began to replace the Wallace Harrison-designed air traffic control tower built in 1962 with a more modern one. The tower began operations on October 9, 2010.

On August 12, 2009, Delta Air Lines and US Airways announced a landing slot and terminal swap in separate press releases. Under the swap plan, US Airways would have given Delta 125 operating slot pairs at LaGuardia. US Airways, in return, would have received 42 operating slot pairs at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Crystal City, Virginia, and be granted the authority to begin service from the US to São Paulo, Brazil, and Tokyo, Japan. When the swap plan was complete, Delta Shuttle operations would have moved from the Marine Air Terminal to Terminal C (the present US Airways terminal), and Terminals C and D would have been connected together. US Airways Shuttle flights would have moved to the Marine Air Terminal, and mainline US Airways flights would have moved to Terminal D (the present Delta terminal). The deal would allow Delta to create a domestic hub at LaGuardia.

The United States Department of Transportation announced that it would approve the Delta–US Airways transaction under the condition that they sell slots to other airlines. Delta and US Airways dropped the slot swap deal in early July 2010, and both airlines filed a court appeal. In May 2011, both airlines announced that they would resubmit their proposal of the slot swap to the US DOT. It was tentatively approved by the US DOT on July 21, 2011. The slot swap received final approval from the US DOT on October 10, 2011.

On December 16, 2011, Delta Air Lines announced plans to open a new domestic hub at LaGuardia Airport. The investment was the largest single expansion by any carrier at LaGuardia in decades, with flights increasing by more than 60%, and destinations by more than 75%. By summer 2013, Delta increased operations to 264 daily flights between LaGuardia and more than 60 cities, more than any other airline at LaGuardia.

In November 2019, Southwest Airlines ended service to Newark, primarily due to the Boeing 737 MAX groundings, poor performance, and inadequate facilities, and consolidated its New York–area operations to LaGuardia and Islip.

====Redevelopment====

In April 2010, Port Authority director Christopher Ward announced that the agency had hired consultants to explore a full demolition and rebuilding of LaGuardia&#x27;s Central Terminal. The project would create a unified, modern, and efficient plan for the airport, currently an amalgam of decades of additions and modifications. The project, expected to cost $2.4 billion, was to include the demolition of the existing central terminal building and its four concourses, garage, hangar 1, and frontage roads; building temporary facilities, and designing and building a new central terminal building. The rebuilding would be staged in phases in order to maintain operations throughout the project.

Proposals were due on January 31, 2012. Patrick Foye, executive director of the Port Authority, said, &quot;It&#x27;s got a quaint, nostalgic but unacceptable kind of the 1940s, 1950s feel that&#x27;s just not acceptable.&quot; The Port Authority was seeking a private company to develop and operate the replacement terminal with private funds, similar to how Delta operates the other terminals at the airport. However, in January 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a plan for the state to oversee the construction of the long-stalled new terminal project instead of the proposed public-private partnership.
On July 27, 2015, Governor Cuomo, joined by then-Vice President Joe Biden, announced a $4 billion plan to rebuild the terminals as one contiguous building with terminal bridges connecting buildings. Airport officials and planners had concluded that the airport essentially had to be torn down and rebuilt.

Under the airport redevelopment plan disclosed in 2015, a single terminal building was to be constructed in stages, with a people mover, retail space, and a new hotel. Some of additional taxiways were to be built, and the Grand Central Parkway was to be reconfigured. A proposed high-speed ferry, if introduced, was to service the Marine Air Terminal, a national historic landmark, which will remain intact. An onsite tram had also been proposed to move passengers more quickly within the central terminal. The new airport is to be eco-friendly and contain accommodations such as a hotel of approximately 200 rooms and a business/conference center. The entire airport will move closer to the Grand Central Parkway. New parking garages replaced parking facilities between the existing terminals and Grand Central Parkway, creating space for the new facilities. By locating the terminals closer to the Grand Central Parkway, additional space for aircraft taxiways and hold areas was created, reducing ground delays. The runways themselves were not reconfigured.

Construction of the project&#x27;s first phase started in spring of 2016, once final plans were approved by the Port Authority board, with the entire redevelopment scheduled to be completed by late 2022. Terminal B would be demolished, and Delta would rebuild its terminals C and D in coordination with the plan. The new airport was to feature an island gate system, with passengers connecting between the terminal building and the gates via bridges that would be high enough for aircraft to taxi under. In late March 2016, the comprehensive plans for the redevelopment were approved unanimously between the Port Authority of New York, New Jersey, and LaGuardia Gateway Partners for the Terminal B Project. Construction costs were estimated to range from $4 billion to $5.3 billion. In August 2017, Magic Johnson Enterprises and Loop Capital created a joint venture named JLC Capital to invest in Phase 2 of LaGuardia Airport&#x27;s reconstruction. The same month, Delta broke ground on the last phase of the airport&#x27;s reconstruction. On December 9, 2017, six airlines moved at LGA in anticipation of the new terminals. Alaska Airlines (originally Virgin America) and JetBlue moved to the Marine Air Terminal. American consolidated in Terminal B. Frontier and Spirit depart from Terminal C and arrive at Terminal D. Since the move, there have been further changes with Alaska Airlines ending service to LaGuardia, JetBlue moving all but Boston flights to Terminal B, and Spirit consolidating its operations in Terminal A.

LaGuardia Gateway Partners, which manages the construction of Terminal B, has completed most of the complex. The first half of the seven-level West Parking Garage opened in February 2018, with 1,600 of 3,100 parking spaces being made available, and the rest of the garage was opened later that year. Eleven new gates at Terminal B opened on December 1, 2018, and were used by Air Canada, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. Five additional gates opened on June 2, 2019, when United relocated most of its operations to the new concourse. The new space included a concourse with a ceiling, food concessions, an FAO Schwarz toy store, and an indoor play area. The new headhouse at Terminal B opened on June 13, 2020, along with the new connector to the Eastern Concourse. On August 5, 2020, American opened the first seven gates of the Western Concourse, with ten additional gates and the bridge connector scheduled to open at the end of 2021. The second bridge connecting to Terminal B was later completed and opened to the public on January 27, 2022.

On the east side of the airport, Delta is consolidating its Terminals C and D, into a centralized Terminal C headhouse, which is located on the former Terminal D parking site. In addition, Delta is rebuilding its airside facilities into four &quot;finger&quot; concourses. The first concourse to open was Concourse G on the eastern end of the airport, which opened on October 29, 2019. Delta Shuttle flights moved to the Concourse G on November 16, 2019. On June 4, 2022, Delta unveiled its new Terminal C headhouse to the public in tandem with concourse E, which boasts 10 narrow body gates. The Terminal C headhouse consolidates the former Terminal C and D&#x27;s security checkpoint into 11 lanes, which if necessary, can be expanded to 16 lanes. Other features include a dedicated drop-off area for carry-on-only passengers, biometric scanning technology, a sensory room designed for those with autism, and Delta&#x27;s largest Sky Club to date.

As of June 2022, Delta was in the process of replacing Terminal D&#x27;s gates and would start construction of Concourse D. Delta is fast-tracking its remaining projects at Terminal C due to the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed the airline to use the decrease in passage traffic to speed up construction by two years.

In March 2024, LaGuardia won the Airport Service Quality Award for &quot;best airport of 25 to 40 million passengers in North America&quot; in 2023.

==Operations==

While LaGuardia frequently accommodates general aviation, the airport is primarily serviced by Part 121 scheduled air carriers providing passenger service to regional, domestic, and limited international destinations. Because of its congested nature and proximity to dense urban neighborhoods, commercial flights to and from the airport are subject to several restrictions enacted by both the FAA and the PANYNJ. The airport almost only ever handles narrow-body aircraft, though it can handle Airplane Design Group IV widebody aircraft such as the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A310, but aircraft in this group are rarely seen at LaGuardia.

===Service restrictions===
====International flights====
LaGuardia, unlike JFK and Newark, does not have U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities. As such, international arrivals are only possible from airports serviced by United States border preclearance. Passengers and crewmembers on these flights clear customs at their departure airport, and for immigration purposes are considered to be on the US territory during their entire journey, allowing them to exit LaGuardia in the same manner as domestic travelers.

====Curfew and perimeter rule====
To mitigate the impact of aircraft noise pollution and facilitate airfield maintenance, a seasonal curfew traditionally exists between the hours of 12am and 6am during the warm months of the year. Additionally, a 1984 &quot;perimeter rule&quot; implemented by PANYNJ bars airline flights to and from points farther than , except on Saturdays or to Denver, Colorado. Transcontinental (coast-to-coast) flights use JFK and Newark. With long-haul operations generally requiring heavier fuel loads and larger aircraft, the regulation aims to eliminate excess perceived noise generated by such flights. Changes to the perimeter rule were considered as recently as 2015, but a New York State Senate bill was introduced in 2021 with the intent of codifying the rule into law.

====Slot system====
As one of the United States&#x27; most-dense and congested class B airports, LaGuardia&#x27;s IFR operations are governed by an FAA slot system. Operators are granted time-sensitive individual takeoff and landing rights in accordance with the International Air Transport Association&#x27;s Worldwide Airport Slot Guidelines. In 2020, the FAA responded to drastic reductions in air traffic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by suspending the expiration of unused slots at several US airports, including LaGuardia.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===
LaGuardia has three active terminals (A, B, and C) with 72 gates. The terminals are all connected by buses and walkways. Signage throughout the terminals was designed by Paul Mijksenaar. As with the other Port Authority airports, some terminals at LaGuardia are managed and maintained by airlines themselves. Terminal B was under direct Port Authority operation, but in 2016, operation of Terminal B was transferred to a private company, LaGuardia Gateway Partners.

LaGuardia is undergoing a multibillion-dollar redesign that resulted in a new Terminal B and a new Terminal C (encompassing the old Terminals C and D). Terminal A remains unchanged except for minor updates. The new layout will consist of new gate concourses, as well. The new Terminal B has two gate concourses referred to as the Western Concourse (Gates 11–31) and Eastern Concourse (Gates 40–59). The new Terminal C has four gate concourses (numbered 61–69, 71–79, 82–89, and 92–98).

====Terminal A====
Terminal A, known as the Marine Air Terminal (MAT), was the airport&#x27;s original terminal for overseas flights. The waterfront terminal was designed to serve the fleet of flying boats, or Clippers, of Pan American Airways, America&#x27;s main international airline throughout the 1930s and 1940s. When a Clipper landed in Long Island Sound, it taxied to a dock where passengers could disembark into the terminal. During World War II, new four-engine land planes were developed, and flying boats stopped carrying scheduled passengers out of New York after 1947. The last Pan American flight left the terminal in February 1952, bound for Bermuda.

Inside the terminal hangs &quot;Flight&quot;, a mural measuring in height and in length; it was the largest mural created as part of the Great Depression–era Works Progress Administration (WPA). Completed by James Brooks in 1942, &quot;Flight&quot; depicts the history of humanity&#x27;s involvement with flight. The mural was painted over without explanation by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in the 1950s, possibly because some saw left-wing symbolism in it. After an extensive restoration project headed by aviation historian Geoffrey Arend, the mural was rededicated in 1980.

In 1986, Pan Am restarted flights at the MAT with the purchase of New York Air&#x27;s shuttle service between Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. In 1991, Delta Air Lines bought the Pan Am Shuttle and subsequently started service from the MAT on September 1. In 1995, the MAT was designated as a historic landmark. A $7 million restoration was completed in time for the airport&#x27;s 65th anniversary of commercial flights on December 2, 2004. On December 9, 2017, JetBlue and Alaska Airlines relocated to the MAT, while Delta consolidated all Delta Shuttle flights to Terminal C. On October 27, 2018, Alaska Airlines ended all service from LaGuardia Airport, leaving JetBlue as the terminal&#x27;s only tenant. On April 28, 2021, Spirit Airlines started operating its Fort Lauderdale–bound flights from Terminal A. On July 20, 2021, JetBlue announced that they will be relocating from the MAT to Terminal B, a move they completed on July 9, 2022, with the relocation of Boston flights to Terminal B. On March 29, 2022, all flights operated by Spirit Airlines now operate out of the MAT. On September 13 of that year, Frontier Airlines moved all of its flights to Terminal A. On April 10, 2024, Frontier moved all flights to Terminal B, leaving Spirit as the only airline operating at Terminal A.

====Terminal B====

Terminal B serves airlines that are not Spirit and Delta, and it functions as a large hub for American Airlines. In 2017, work started on the first of two new concourses, which replaced the old A, B, C, and D concourses. The new terminal was designed by Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum.

In 2020, the new Terminal B headhouse opened with a bridge connecting it to the completed Eastern Concourse. On January 27, 2022, a second bridge was completed, connecting Terminal B&#x27;s headhouse to the Western Concourse. In 2022, the old Terminal B was demolished.

On October 31, 2021, JetBlue moved to Terminal B (except for flights to Boston), as the airline wanted to make connections easier with American Airlines due to the &quot;Northeast Alliance&quot; between them. JetBlue&#x27;s Boston flights moved to Terminal B on July 9, 2022.

Headhouse Floorplans:
Western Concourse (Gates 11–31)
Airlines that operate out of the Western Concourse include:
*American Airlines / American Eagle
Eastern Concourse (Gates 40–59)
On December 1, 2018, eleven gates at Terminal B&#x27;s new Eastern Concourse opened. Five additional gates opened on June 2, 2019, allowing United Airlines to move all of its operations at LaGuardia to the new concourse. Airlines operating out of the Eastern Concourse include:
*Air Canada / Air Canada Express
*Frontier Airlines
*JetBlue
*Southwest Airlines
*United Airlines / United Express

====Terminal C====

The new Terminal C, designed by Corgan, opened on June 4, 2022, and connects to four concourses serving Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection flights. Three of these concourses are new (E, F and G) and one (D) is part of the original Terminal C and was refurbished while maintaining much of the structure. When completed, the new Terminal C will include access to 37 gates in its four concourses. The new Terminal C also has a Delta Sky Club, the airline&#x27;s largest.

===Former terminals===

====Terminal B (1964–2022)====
The Central Terminal Building (CTB) was originally six blocks long, and consisted of a four-story central section, two three-story wings, and four concourses (A, B, C, and D) with 40 aircraft gates. The $36 million facilities designed by Harrison and Abramovitz was dedicated on April 17, 1964. Delta and US Airways left the CTB in 1983 and 1992 respectively for their own dedicated terminals on the east side of the airport. The Port Authority and various airlines carried out a $340 million improvement project in the 1990s to expand and renovate the existing space. The terminal was replaced by the new Terminal B, with the final gates (Concourse D) and terminal already demolished in early 2022.

====Terminal C (1992–2022)====

The original Terminal C (formerly known as the East End Terminal and USAir Terminal) was a facility that opened September 12, 1992, at a cost of $250 million. Designed by William Nicholas Bodouva + Associates Architects and Planners, it housed part of Delta&#x27;s operations at LaGuardia. On June 4, 2022, Terminal C&#x27;s check-in and baggage claim areas were closed.

The building was initially conceived in a 1989 agreement between the Port Authority and Texas Air Corporation (then-owner of Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lines). When Eastern was forcibly bankrupted by Texas Air, its assets—including the new terminal&#x27;s leases—were transferred to Continental. Continental never moved in, and in turn, sold the leases (along with most of its LaGuardia slots) to US Airways as part of a bankruptcy restructuring. Trump Shuttle, successor to the Eastern Air Shuttle, also occupied the terminal before becoming US Airways Shuttle.

As a result of a slot-swap deal between Delta and US Airways, as of July 2012, Delta occupied the majority of the terminal (gates C15–C44). American (the former US Airways flights) operated some flights from gates C35–C44 until December 9, 2017. The eastern concourse connected to Terminal C has been closed and demolished (Gates C15-C24), and the construction of the new Concourse E has been completed. The new concourse opened to the public on June 4, 2022. This new concourse is numbered 70–79 for its gates. Although Delta originally planned to completely replace the western concourse, it instead opted to refurbish the interior while maintaining much of the structure. These gates have been renumbered 61-69.

====Terminal D (1983–2022)====

Terminal D opened on June 19, 1983, at a cost of approximately $90 million, and was designed by William Nicholas Bodouva + Associates Architects to accommodate Delta&#x27;s new Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 aircraft. This terminal also housed Northwest Airlines and Northwest Airlink from its opening in 1983 until the merger into Delta in 2009.

As of January 8, 2020, Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection operate out of the new Concourse G that was connected to Terminal D. Terminal D was connected to Terminal C by a 600-foot walkway, which opened in early 2013 as part of Delta&#x27;s effort to build a hub at LaGuardia. As of September 1, 2020, the walkway between Terminals C and D were demolished, and the construction of the new Concourse F is currently underway.

As of June 4, 2022, Terminal D&#x27;s check-in and baggage claim areas were closed. During the week of September 12–18, 2022, the central and eastern sections of Terminal D were demolished. The western end of Terminal D with a Delta Sky Club and gates 81–85 remained operational while the new Concourse F was constructed. After the eastern end of Concourse F fully opened, Terminal D shut down to allow installation for Concourse F&#x27;s western gates. Once completed, the new concourse will use gate numbers 82–89.

===General aviation===
Although there is no separate terminal building for general aviation aircraft a pseudo-terminal is operated within the Marine Air Terminal (Terminal A), which is currently run by Modern Aviation providing full FBO services to private and charter aircraft owners-pilots including 100LL and Jet A fueling, computerized weather, and flight planning as well as pilot and passenger lounges. To access the General Aviation terminal an on-airport tenant must possess a SIDA (Security Identification Display Area) badge for unescorted access, transient aircraft owners-pilots and passengers must be escorted at all times into and out of the GA Terminal and to the ramp and hangar areas by the FBO staff.

Following the September 11 attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration changed the rules for the landing and departure of general aviation aircraft at LaGuardia. Pilots operating a non-scheduled instrument flight rules (IFR) flight are now required to make a reservation via the FAA&#x27;s e-CVRS system no more than 72 hours prior to the flight&#x27;s arrival or departure while public charter flights may make a reservation up to six months prior. Unscheduled IFR flights may only operate at LaGuardia with a reservation from the hours of 6:00 am to 9:59 pm local time Monday thru Friday and 12:00 pm to 9:59 pm local time on Sundays. Reservations for unscheduled IFR flights are not required all day on Saturdays. Aircraft without a reservation will be redirected to either Teterboro Airport or Linden Airport.

A private seaplane base, EDO , operates three waterways in Flushing Bay and the East River north of LaGuardia Airport.

===Other facilities===
When New York Air was in operation, its headquarters were in Hangar 5 at LaGuardia.

Law enforcement and Aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) services are provided by the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD). The agency&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport Command (Building 137) was completed in 2010. Emergency medical services are provided by North Shore University Hospital under contract to the Port Authority.

Overlooking the approach end of runway 4 is Planeview Park, a public park operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The space contains park benches and lawns adjacent the Grand Central Parkway along the southern perimeter of the airport and is a prime viewing location for aircraft spotting.

, buses are the only mode of mass transit to connect the airport with its surroundings. All terminals are served by accessible public MTA bus lines—including two Select Bus Services (SBS)—and free transfers to the New York City Subway are provided when passengers pay using OMNY or MetroCard.
*M60 Select Bus Service (all terminals)
*Q47 (Terminal A only)
*Q48 (all terminals)
*Q70 &quot;LaGuardia Link&quot; Select Bus Service (all terminals except Terminal A)
*Q72 (all terminals except Terminal A)
The airport also features a complementary internal shuttle bus route which makes stops at all terminals.

Despite many failed proposals throughout its history, LaGuardia is not served directly by rail. Nearby lines of the New York City Subway and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), however, provides northern Queens with connections to the greater New York metropolitan area and are commonly accessed from the airport by public bus or private car services.

The airport is mainly accessible via the Grand Central Parkway and overpasses at 94th Street and 102nd Street. Taxicabs serving LaGuardia are metered and licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, and uniformed airport employees are stationed to dispatch fares. For-hire-vehicles (FHV) including limousines and rideshare operators are accommodated at designated locations. In 2019, PANYNJ approved the implementation of &quot;airport access fee&quot; surcharges on FHV and taxi trips, with the revenue earmarked to support the agency&#x27;s capital programs.

<doc id="248548" wikidata="Q266670" url="?curid=248548" title="Megumi Hayashibara">
<text>is a Japanese voice actress, singer, lyricist and radio personality from Kita ward in Tokyo and is affiliated with self-founded Woodpark Office. One of the most prominent Japanese voice actresses since the 1990s, Hayashibara is best known for her roles in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot;, &quot;Magical Princess Minky Momo&quot;, &quot;Mashin Hero Wataru&quot;, &quot;Ranma ½&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Slayers&quot;, &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;All Purpose Cultural Catgirl Nuku Nuku&quot;, &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;, &quot;Video Girl Ai&quot;, and &quot;Shaman King&quot; for which she also performed various OP and ED themes in both the 2001 and 2021 adaptations. 
==Biography==

Hayashibara was born on March 30, 1967, in Kita Tokyo, Japan. She studied at a Catholic school and at one point was bullied in fifth grade. She was an active club member and participated in the Badminton, Biology, Broadcasting, Drama and English clubs. She played the role of Alice in an English language production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Despite qualifying as a nurse, she has never been employed in a nursing position.

On March 30, 1998, Hayashibara got married. On January 10, 2004, Hayashibara announced on her radio show that she was pregnant with her first child. On June 28 of the same year, she gave birth to her daughter via caesarian section.

===Voice acting===
On the same day as submitting the application for nursing school, Hayashibara went to a book store and found an advert offering free anime voice acting auditions at Arts Vision. Several months after submitting a demo tape, she received a confirmation of passing the first stage of the audition, and eventually decided to continue training as a nurse while doing voice acting. In 1986, after a year of voice actor training, Hayashibara was chosen to voice small roles on Maison Ikkoku. Initially, she had difficulty with her lines and had to redo many lines after the main recording sessions. Hayashibara later auditioned for &quot;Ranma ½&quot; expecting to be cast as Akane Tendo, but was cast as the female half of Ranma Saotome instead. In 1993 and 1995, Hayashibara was a guest at Anime America. At the 1995 event, she decided to give a speech in English after believing the translation at the 1993 event did not reflect what she had said. In 1995, Hayashibara provided the voice of Rei Ayanami in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, a role referred to as &quot;innovative casting&quot;.

In addition to voicing Musashi/Jessie of Team Rocket in &quot;Pokémon&quot;, Hayashibara has also voiced Ash&#x27;s Pidgeotto and Pidgeot, May&#x27;s Skitty, Whitney&#x27;s Miltank, Clair&#x27;s Dratini and Dragonair, Latios, Latias, and Anabel&#x27;s Espeon in both the Japanese and English-language versions of the anime. She also provides the voice for Ai Haibara in the ongoing anime series, Detective Conan.

While Hayashibara rarely voices male characters, she voiced as Shuichi Saihara in &quot;Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony&quot; due to her deep and vast experience connected to detective characters. She has actually helped the team on making Shuichi more detective-like.

In 2001, Hayashibara was cast as Anna Kyoyama In the anime adaptation of the Shonen series Shaman King while also performing the opening themes Over Soul and Northern Lights. Twenty years later she reprised her role as Anna in the 2021 remake and performed the first opening theme Soul Salvation and the first ending theme #Boku no Yubisaki. Over Soul was used as the credits song for episode 5. Hayashibara&#x27;s 2010 song Osorezan Revoir would also be used as the ending theme of episode 33: which concluded the Osorezan Revoir arc of the story.

===DJ===
While at nursing school, Hayashibara started a temporary job as a DJ at a local ice skating rink. After becoming better known as a voice actress, she was given her own radio show, &quot;Heartful Station&quot;. After 17 shows, the broadcasting station cancelled the show and other anime related programming to concentrate on traditional music. However, six months later, Hayashibara started a new radio show at another broadcaster.

===Writing===
Hayashibara wrote a series of manga for &quot;Anime V&quot; magazine, with artwork by Sakura Asagi. The comics, known as &quot;Megumi-Toons&quot;, talked about her personal life and career. The individual chapters were collected into the book , which has been reprinted several times. Hayashibara has also contributed two columns to &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine; &quot;Aitakute Aitakute&quot;, and &quot;Speaking in Character&quot;. &quot;Aitakute Aitakute&quot; is a series of interviews conducted by Hayashibara with people from all walks of life. Three compilations of the column have been published. &quot;Speaking in Character&quot; has been translated into English for &quot;Newtype USA&quot;.

In February 2021, Yen Press announced the release of Hayashibara&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Characters Taught Me Everything: Living Life One Episode at a Time&quot;, in which she examines her career and the ways the characters she portrayed in various anime series affected it. The book is currently available for digital release, with the physical release slated for August 2021.

<text>is a Japanese voice actress and singer affiliated with VIMS and Starchild. She has been affectionately nicknamed by her Japanese fans. She debuted as a voice actress in 1997, releasing her debut single &quot;My best friend&quot; on . Since then, she has been involved in excess of 350 productions in addition to promotional material, concert performances, as well as charting several albums and singles. She won the award for Best Supporting Voice Actress in the 4th Seiyu Awards.

She is one of a handful of Japanese idol voice actors that rose to prominence in the 2000s, whose popularity today has been attributed to their solid experience and long-term interaction with their fan base, as opposed to the contemporary norms of youth and beauty in the entertainment industry. As a result of her ongoing success, she has performed solo at large music venues, such as the Nippon Budokan in 2009 and the Yoyogi National Gymnasium&#x27;s First Stadium in 2015, each with capacities of approximately 14,000 and 13,000, respectively. Her official fanclub is the &quot;Black Cat Alliance&quot;.

Some of her notable roles in anime include Naru Narusegawa in &quot;Love Hina&quot;, Izayoi Riko/Cure Magical in &quot;Witchy PreCure!&quot;, Multi in &quot;To Heart&quot;, Tohru Honda in &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;, Ai in &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori&quot;, Ayu Tsukimiya in &quot;Kanon&quot;, Yuki Cross in &quot;Vampire Knight&quot;, Hanyuu and Maria Ushiromiya in, respectively, &quot;Higurashi When They Cry&quot; and &quot;Umineko When They Cry&quot;, Miss Monochrome in &quot;Miss Monochrome&quot;, Minori Kushieda in &quot;Toradora!&quot;, Tsubasa Hanekawa in &quot;Monogatari&quot;, Chie Satonaka in &quot;Persona 4&quot;, Kōko Kaga in &quot;Golden Time&quot;, Carla in &quot;Fairy Tail&quot; and Wiz in &quot;KonoSuba&quot;.

==Personal life==
Born in Tokyo, Horie spent much of her younger years as a latchkey kid. As an only child, (at that time) she would spend most of her time alone, playing outside of her residence after school until 7pm, when her parents would return from work. In junior high school, she joined the volleyball club but did not enjoy it much. Horie refers to her time at junior high and high school as her &#x27;dark era&#x27;. Early childhood interests included watching the anime series &quot;Dirty Pair&quot;. She was fascinated by the main premise as a detective. She would act out scenes from memory with a school friend and also record herself with a cassette player.

In 1995, during the first year of college, Horie auditioned at the Japan Voice Acting Institute for a scholarship, the voice training school for Arts Vision. She can be quoted as saying &quot;I went for an audition instead of hunting for a job, hahaha...&quot;. Horie graduated after 4 years of training. During this time she entered the SME Voice Actor Audition in 1996, winning the Namco Prize, (with Ayako Kawasumi winning the Special Award). On August 28, 1996, Horie and 21 other voice students (including Yukari Tamura) were unveiled at Nippon Cultural Broadcasting Inc.&#x27;s &quot;SOMETHING DREAMS &#x27;96&quot; at the Tokyo International Exhibition Centre as the &quot;Dorikan Club&quot;, a group of aspiring voice actresses.

==Career==
===1997–1999: Early career===
Whilst still training and under the representation of Arts Vision, Horie was able to make her voice actor debut in the 1997 Sega Saturn game, &quot;Voice Fantasia: Ushinawareta Voice Power&quot;. Her first leading role was in the 1998 anime Kurogane Communication, of which she sang the theme songs, &quot;&quot;My best friend&quot; and &quot;Dear Mama&quot;&quot;. These two songs were released as Horie&#x27;s first single under the Pony Canyon music label. In 1999, with the increasing number of eroge and visual novels being adapted to anime, Horie was able to win a major role as Multi, a robotic girl, in the romantic anime &quot;To Heart&quot;.

===2000–2003: Growing success===
The following year, Horie succeeded in auditioning for the lead female role of the TV anime adaptation of the &quot;shōnen&quot; manga comedy &quot;Love Hina&quot;, as Naru Narusegawa. Love Hina was a huge hit, with sales of over one million DVDs. The high popularity at the time lead to Lycos Japan using the anime to advertise its search engine and other services, with narration from Horie. This was to be her first CM. The ascending popularity of &quot;Love Hina&quot; spawned a lucrative franchise of OVAs, Drama CDs and games, of which Horie reprised the star role.

In regard to their rising fame, Horie worked with Yukari Tamura and form the group . This group had two debuts in 2000, on April 30 at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and May 13 at Nagoya&#x27;s Nadia Park Complex. The first of these was called &quot;&quot;Yamato Nadeshiko Debut Kinen First Live ~suddenly 1000 seconds live in Yoyogi~&quot;, which happened during the &quot;Dorikan Club Fifth Anniversary Event&quot;&quot;. Together they would release two singles, in 2000 and &quot;Merry Merrily&quot; in 2001, the latter being used as an insert song in the Love Hina Christmas Special. This collaboration ended with a seven date concert tour during June 2003, including stops at Sapporo, Nagoya, Osaka and Tokyo.

2000 also saw Horie publish her first photobook, , and the release of her debut album, Mizutamari ni Utsuru Sekai, through the Starchild label which featured two songs from Love Hina.

In 2001, Starchild established her official fan club called , where member benefits included fan events, priority seating in concerts, bimonthly newsletters, and access to exclusive merchandise. The first meeting, which was named &quot;Black Cat Rally Vol.1 - Akasaka BLITZ&quot; was on July 21, where they held a rally and a quiz show.

Early in 2002, Horie&#x27;s first solo concert tour kicked off on January 26 at the Club Diamond Hall in Nagoya, a 1000 capacity venue. &quot;堀江由衣 First Live Tour&quot;, lasted a total of 6 nights, travelling to Tokyo and ending on February 11 in Osaka at the Matsushita IMP Hall. In 2002, she voiced Ayu Tsukimiya in the anime adaptation of &quot;Kanon&quot;, an adult visual novel that she had also voiced in 1999. Horie released her first collection of music videos on July 29. The 27 minute VHS tape was called &quot;Yui Horie CLIPS 0 〜since &#x27;00〜&#x27;01〜&quot;, featuring interviews, making-ofs and notably the music video for &quot;&quot;Love Destiny&quot; the theme song of the 2001 anime adaptation of Sister Princess. 

The same year, Horie started her weekly radio show, , which was first broadcast on October 6, and can currently be heard on the station (AM 1134 kHz) at 22:00 – 22:30 every Sunday. Her signature catchphrase is &quot;Angel Beam in your Heart!&quot; and frequently features anison guests such as angela, Nana Mizuki and Megumi Hayashibara. As of the end of 2016, the show has run in excess of 740 episodes.

In 2003, Horie established herself as a popular singer when her third album &quot;Sky&quot; peaked at 10th in the Oricon charts.

===Other activities===

In October 2005, she founded Aice5, a J-Pop group consisting of four other voice actors, to help launch their careers. Their debut single was &quot;Get Back&quot;, released March 13, 2006. Aice5 was disbanded on September 20, 2007, at their farewell concert &quot;Final Aice5 Party LAST Aice5&quot; at the Yokohama Arena. During this time, they released six singles and one album. Their album &quot;Love Aice5&quot; was released on February 26, 2007, remaining in the Oricon charts for four weeks with a highest rank of eight. Aice5 has since been revived, announced on July 17, 2015, with the intention to release a new single on September 30 and have their comeback concert on November 22.

Horie has collaborated with a few other artists. In 2004, she released &quot;Scramble&quot;&quot; together with Unscandal. This ska inspired song was used as an opening theme song for the romantic comedy anime School Rumble . And in 2006, she formed the goth band &quot;Kurobara Hozonkai&quot; (lit. &quot;Black Rose Preservation Society&quot;), with Horie taking the stage name of YUIEL. This band released the album &quot;&quot;A Votre Sante!!&quot;&quot; in 2008 and has been relatively inactive since.

Horie was affiliated with Arts Vision. However, she eventually left the agency in mid-2007 during an unrelated scandal in the agency&#x27;s top management and became a freelance voice actress. Today, she&#x27;s affiliated with VIMS, a division of I&#x27;m Enterprise. She has published seven independent musical albums. Nearly all of them incorporate at least one track from an anime she has worked with. She currently releases music under the Starchild label (a subdivision of King Records).

In late 2012, Horie created and voiced the 3D animated character Miss Monochrome. Her first appearance was in &quot;The Adventure Over Yui Horie III ~Secret Mission Tour~&quot; concert, acting as the antagonist who wanted to turn the world black and white. The character has since had a self-titled anime series, with the premier season televised on . The opening theme song, &quot;Poker Face&quot;, was released as a musical single. Other notable appearances include the iOS game Girlfriend Beta, a self-titled manga series and cameos in other anime.

<text>Corey Ian Haim (December 23, 1971 – March 10, 2010) was a Canadian actor who rose to fame in the 1980s as a teen heartthrob. He starred in &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; (1985), &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1985), &quot;Lucas&quot; (1986), &quot;License to Drive&quot; (1988) and &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1989). His role in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; (1987), alongside Corey Feldman made him a household name. Known as The Two Coreys, the duo became 1980s icons and appeared together in seven films, later starring in the A&amp;E American reality show &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;.

Haim&#x27;s early success led to money and fame. He had difficulty breaking away from the trauma of his experience as a child actor and struggled with substance abuse and personal demons. He faced numerous challenges in his adult life, including financial difficulties and ongoing battles with addiction. He died of pneumonia on March 10, 2010.

== Early life ==
Haim was born on December 23, 1971, in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Judy Haim, an Israeli-born data processor, and Bernie Haim, who worked in sales. In 1982, his parents divorced after 18 years of marriage. He had an older sister, Cari, and a younger half-brother, Daniel Lee, from his father&#x27;s second marriage. Haim was Jewish; his Hebrew name was Yechezkel Yehudah.

Haim was raised in Chomedey, Laval, Quebec (a suburb of Montreal), and, later, Willowdale, Toronto. There, his mother enrolled him in drama classes in improvisation and mime to help him overcome his shyness. Haim&#x27;s skill as a hockey player led to his being scouted for the AA Thunderbirds. Haim attended several schools in both Thornhill, Ontario, and North York, Ontario (including North York&#x27;s Zion Heights Junior High), until grade eight.

== Career ==
===Early acting career===
After accompanying his sister Cari to auditions, Haim was noticed and was offered roles as a child actor. He began performing in commercials in 1981. Later, he played the role of Larry in the Canadian children&#x27;s educational comedy television series &quot;The Edison Twins&quot;. Haim made his feature film debut in the 1984 thriller &quot;Firstborn&quot; as a boy whose family comes under threat from his mother&#x27;s violent boyfriend, played by Peter Weller. Haim&#x27;s first day of shooting was with Weller, and he attempted to compliment the older actor on his performance. Weller collared Haim, threw him up against a wall, and demanded Haim never speak to him after a take. It took three assistants to separate them. Haim later admitted that he was terrified by the experience. Weller apologized to Haim, saying method acting caused his actions. 

In 1985, Haim appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; and &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot;, the latter with Sally Field, of whom he was reportedly in awe. Also that year, he had the leading role in &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;, Stephen King&#x27;s feature adaptation of his own lycanthropic novella. Haim played a paraplegic 10-year-old boy who warns his uncle (played by Gary Busey) that their town is being terrorized by a werewolf. Haim began to gain industry recognition, earning his first Young Artist Award for the NBC movie &quot;A Time to Live,&quot; in which he played Liza Minnelli&#x27;s character&#x27;s dying son. At the time, Haim&#x27;s father was acting as his manager. He turned down a role for Haim in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, which was later taken by River Phoenix. Producer Stanley Jaffe approached the father to remark on Haim&#x27;s gifts, and recommended that he get an agent in Los Angeles.

===Hollywood teen stardom===

Haim&#x27;s breakout role came in 1986, when he starred with Kerri Green, Charlie Sheen, and Winona Ryder as the titular character in &quot;Lucas&quot;. The coming-of-age story, about first love and teen angst, centers on an intelligent misfit who struggles for acceptance after falling for a cheerleader. Haim turned 14 on the set in Chicago, and fell in love with Green, who played his romantic interest in the film. Haim&#x27;s unrequited love for Green helped inspire his performance, with the real-life dynamics between them expressed on screen. Director David Seltzer noticed that unlike some of his peers, Haim seemed at ease with his burgeoning heartthrob status: &quot;He took it in stride. Not in a negative way, but he was something of a magnet and he knew it.&quot; Haim had read for River Phoenix&#x27;s role in &quot;Stand By Me&quot; while eating lunch in director Rob Reiner&#x27;s backyard, and got the part the same day that he was offered &quot;Lucas&quot;. He later said he would not have changed his decision. Haim was nominated for a Young Artist Award for his performance as Lucas, and film critic Roger Ebert gave him a glowing review: &quot;He creates one of the most three-dimensional, complicated, interesting characters of any age in any recent movie. If he can continue to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor. He is that good.&quot; Following &quot;Lucas&quot;, Haim moved to Los Angeles, and starred in the short-lived 1987 television series &quot;Roomies&quot; with Burt Young.

In 1987, Haim had a featured role as Sam Emerson, the younger of two brothers, a comic-reading teen turned vampire hunter in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. Though he had seen &quot;Lucas&quot;, Schumacher initially was not sold on casting Haim. The director was convinced by their first meeting. Shot between the Warner Brothers lot and the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, the young cast included Jason Patric, Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, and Corey Feldman, and the set was lively. &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; was well-received by most critics, made over $32 million at the U.S. box office, and is regarded as a 1980s classic. The performance earned Haim another Young Artist Award nomination as Best Young Male Superstar in a Motion Picture. The film marked his recurring on-screen partnership with Feldman. The two young actors had previously become aware of one another when Haim auditioned for the role of Mouth in &quot;The Goonies&quot;, which Feldman secured. &quot;The Two Coreys&quot; ascended to become the highest paid teen stars of the 1980s.

In the era of &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; and &quot;Bop&quot;, Haim was a favored cover star. His trademark lopsided smile prompted his &quot;Never Too Late&quot; co-star Cloris Leachman to admonish him: &quot;You know, that smirk you have is cute, but sometimes it looks a little fake. I would definitely practice closing your mouth a little more.&quot; He often played underdogs. Next came &quot;License to Drive&quot;, co-starring Feldman and Heather Graham, in which Haim played the lead role of Les, whose love life is crippled by a lack of a car. He achieves his wish-fulfillment fantasy of turning his life around on one wild night. &quot;There were some shenanigans behind the scenes,&quot; remarked director Greg Beeman of the indulgences of the Two Coreys. &quot;They would disappear sometimes, but they always showed up for work.&quot; At the time of the shoot, 16-year-old Haim only had a learner&#x27;s permit, requiring an adult to be concealed in the back seat of the Cadillac he drove in the movie. The film featured Haim&#x27;s signature ad-libbing at its height. Haim was receiving nearly 2,000 fan letters a week and worked to avoid the potentially &quot;psycho&quot; girls who circled the block where he lived in an apartment downstairs from his mother&#x27;s. &quot;License to Drive&quot; won Haim his second Young Artist Award (tying Feldman for the Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy award), and went on to gross over $22 million domestically.

Haim starred in the horror film &quot;Watchers&quot;, adapted from the Dean R. Koontz novel, in which he played a teen who befriends a highly intelligent dog altered by military research, leading to the two being pursued. Haim and Feldman next teamed in the metaphysical romantic comedy &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot;. Four days before the shoot commenced on January 7, 1988, Haim broke his leg. His character&#x27;s injury was added to accommodate his cast and resulting limp. After the cast was removed two weeks later, Haim was required to wear a false one for the remainder of the shoot. He semi-improvised his scenes in the film.

===Personal troubles and career downturn===
Haim later said that &quot;License to Drive&quot; was his &quot;breaking point&quot; for becoming addicted to drugs. On April 9, 1989, Haim appeared live onstage at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm with DJ &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hamilton as part of a teen anti-drugs campaign. The thousand-strong audience of girls would not stop screaming and rushing the stage, and fire marshals had to escort Haim from the building amid fears for his safety. Haim later said that he was terrified of going onstage afterward, and had resolved never to go on any stage ever again. In November 1989, fresh out of rehab, Haim released a self-promotional video titled &quot;Corey Haim: Me, Myself, and I&quot;, which followed a day in his life. Heavily scripted, Haim&#x27;s monologues to camera were nevertheless unfocused and suggested that he was under the influence during filming. The film has been considered the &quot;worst movie ever&quot; by X-Entertainment. Haim set up a pre-recorded drug advice line for teens. He admitted on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; that he was high while giving the advice.

In 1990, Haim co-starred with Patricia Arquette in the sci-fi actioner &quot;Prayer of the Rollerboys&quot;, performing many of his own stunts in a tale of a teen who goes undercover to expose a racist gang leader. However, as his problems with drugs continued, Haim began to lose his core audience. His performances suffered, and his film career in the 1990s declined into direct-to-video releases. In 1991, aged 19, he starred in &quot;Dream Machine&quot;, which received a direct-to-video release, as did &quot;Oh, What a Night&quot; and &quot;The Double 0 Kid&quot;, in which Seth Green had a role. Green said his experiences of working with Haim was a duality between a sweet, hardworking professional who loved acting and a tormented addict. Additional direct-to-video films included the 1992 erotic thriller &quot;Blown Away&quot;. Co-star Nicole Eggert, who was romantically involved with Haim at the time and also featured in &quot;The Double O Kid&quot;, later stated that on-set medics would facilitate his needs to keep him from withdrawing. She recalled filming with Haim during the day and spending the nights with him in the emergency room, &quot;hooked up to an IV, begging doctors for a different prescription, then going back to work again the next day&quot;.

In December 1992, Haim partnered in a lease-option on a 1922 Hancock Park mansion with his business manager, a party promoter named Michael Bass who had served two years in jail after a conviction for fraud. The house was valued at $1.35M. Bass rushed through the deal in order to hold a fund-raiser at the house to buy toys for Russian children, later revealed to be a scam. Haim lived at the house with Bass and his mother. Haim visited Mannheim, Germany, in 1994 to sign a deal with the German record label Edel and recorded an album there. However, the deal fell through and the album remained unreleased. One of the songs, the euro-house influenced &quot;You Give Me Everything&quot;, produced by Daniel Schubert and Daniel Gonschorek, was released in 1995 as a 4-track single. Over the next two years, Haim released sequels to two of his older films, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Fast Getaway II&quot; along with &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Last Resort&quot;, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Life 101&quot;, and &quot;Dream a Little Dream 2&quot; with Feldman. Haim also unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Robin in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;Batman Forever&quot;.

Brooke McCarter managed Haim through the mid-1990s, but, citing drug problems, eventually dropped him. In 1996, Haim starred in four more direct-to-video films — &quot;Snowboard Academy&quot;, &quot;Demolition High&quot;, &quot;Fever Lake&quot; and &quot;Busted&quot; — the last also co-starring and directed by Corey Feldman. Feldman was forced to fire Haim after he refused to curtail his drug use and was inconsistent on set, later saying that it was one of the hardest things he ever had to do. He had a small role in the television film &quot;&quot;. In 1997, he appeared in &quot;Never Too Late&quot; and the sequel to &quot;Demolition High&quot;, titled &quot;Demolition University&quot; (on which he was credited as an executive producer).

===Bankruptcy and further difficulties===
Haim nearly went broke after he pulled out of the film &quot;Paradise Bar&quot; in 1996. He was sued by Lloyd&#x27;s of London for $375,000 for failing to disclose his drug addiction as a pre-existing medical condition on the insurance form. Haim filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 1997. According to the bankruptcy report, he owed $100,000 to the IRS, and had $100,000 in outstanding debts. His listed assets included $100 in cash, the red 1987 Alfa Romeo Spider featured in &quot;Corey Haim: Me, Myself, and I&quot;, $750 worth of clothing, a $31,000 pension fund, and royalty rights worth $7,500. At this point, Haim&#x27;s film roles evaporated. In 1999, Haim shot a troubled low-budget independent film called &quot;Universal Groove&quot; in Montreal, using then-emerging digital technology. He played a film director interacting with eight characters over the course of one night on the techno club scene. Haim&#x27;s return to Canada was newsworthy, with the shoot garnering local press interest and reporters from &quot;People&quot; magazine visiting the set. However, the film experienced fatal post-production problems, and stolen footage was leaked on the Internet. Over eight years later, the filmmakers finally self-released a reconstructed version of the film online.

Haim attempted to return to the industry in 2000 with the direct-to-video thriller &quot;Without Malice&quot;, with Jennifer Beals and Craig Sheffer. He hoped that playing the role of an ex-addict who conceals a murder with his sister&#x27;s fiancé would offer him a transition from teen fare. The film was made in Waskesiu, Saskatchewan, where crew members recalled Haim&#x27;s propping up the town&#x27;s only bar until the early hours. In 2001, Haim was the subject of an &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;. Airing on October 17, it showed him living in a spartan apartment above a garage in Santa Monica with his mother. Haim was disoriented and unintelligible for some of his interviews. He was seen compiling a promotional clip reel for casting agents, and a pawnbroker recalled his begging for $3 to buy a slice of pizza. Feldman spoke on the program about his attempts to help Haim kick the habit, and moved him into his house in October 2001. Aged 29, Haim spent four days at Michael Jackson&#x27;s Neverland Ranch with Feldman.

Able to poke fun at himself, Haim made a cameo appearance in David Spade&#x27;s &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot;, a film about a former child star, which included an array of actual former child stars, including Feldman. Haim also appeared in spoof horror movie &quot;The Back Lot Murders&quot;. In 2002, he guest-starred as himself in an episode of the Canadian television series &quot;Big Wolf on Campus&quot;. Haim was the subject of a 2004 song by the Irish band The Thrills called &quot;Whatever Happened to Corey Haim?&quot;

===&quot;The Two Coreys&quot; and final years===

In 2006, Haim was ranked #8 on VH1&#x27;s list of the Greatest Teen Stars. In December 2006, Haim began taping a reality show titled &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;, which reunited him with Feldman. Both were credited as executive producers, and had a measure of creative input. The show premiered on the A&amp;E Network on July 29, 2007, with a second season starting on June 22, 2008. At its advent, Haim bought himself and Feldman matching Tiffany rings. The show&#x27;s premise revolved around Haim living in Feldman&#x27;s house with Feldman and Feldman&#x27;s wife while trying to get his career back on track. The dynamics of the threesome were conceived in the style of the film &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot;. Footage showed the ravages of Haim&#x27;s habit on his body, and his appearance was unrecognizable. Although acknowledged as partially scripted, the show eventually took on a darker life of its own after Haim relapsed and his prescription drug abuse became apparent.

In one of the darkest moments of &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;, Haim told Feldman that he had been sexually abused at the age of 14 by one of Feldman&#x27;s acquaintances. Declining to identify his molester (a 42-year-old man), Haim said that the abuse had continued for two years with Feldman&#x27;s knowledge. This disclosure led to a further rift between Haim and Feldman, and the show continued to expose the darker side of their lives as teen stars. The disintegrating relationship between the former best friends prompted a six-month hiatus before the second season. Haim was nominated for a Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award at the 22nd Annual Gemini Awards in Canada for his role in the show.

In the early 2000s, Haim attempted to support himself by selling clumps of his hair and an extracted molar on eBay. The tooth reached $150 before being pulled from the listings in line with eBay&#x27;s restrictions on the sale of body parts. On February 7, 2008, Haim ran a paid advertisement in the Hollywood trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; with a full-page photo, stating: &quot;This is not a stunt. I&#x27;m back. I&#x27;m ready to work. I&#x27;m ready to make amends&quot;. In February 2008, filming commenced in Vancouver for &quot;Lost Boys: The Tribe&quot;, a direct-to-DVD sequel featuring few of the original cast. Haim wept when he was told on-camera that there was no role for him in the film. He later was scheduled to film a cameo appearance, but turned up on the set obviously under the influence and was unable to remember his lines. A&amp;E canceled &quot;The Two Coreys&quot; midway through its second season in July 2008.

Amid the Two Coreys&#x27; well-publicized estrangement came unconfirmed reports that Warner Bros. planned to release a &quot;Lost Boys 3&quot;—with their characters facing off. Feldman was confirmed to star in and act as executive producer of &quot;Lost Boys: The Thirst&quot;. In July 2008, Haim completed filming on the gambling comedy &quot;Shark City&quot; in Toronto with Vivica A. Fox, Carlo Rota and David Phillips. Haim and G Tom Mac developed an idea for a reality show called &quot;Lost Boy Found&quot;, documenting Haim&#x27;s addiction and recovery through music at Mac&#x27;s studio, where he had been given a place to stay. Mac pledged that if Haim stayed clean, he would allow him to come on tour and perform with him. A pilot was filmed, but the show was not picked up.

In 2009, &quot;&quot; was released, which saw Haim sporting a blonde mullet alongside Jason Statham, Amy Smart, and Dwight Yoakam. Haim completed two films scheduled for a 2010 release: the thriller &quot;American Sunset&quot;, in which he played a man who is abducted in the search for his missing wife, and &quot;Decisions&quot;, shot in December 2009, in which his character is a cop working with troubled kids. &quot;American Sunset&quot; wrapped in New Brunswick, Canada, on June 18, 2009. Haim was attached to several films scheduled to go into production in 2010. In his final days, he was working on &quot;The Dead Sea&quot;, a film in which mercenaries on a naval ship are trapped by zombies. He requested a &quot;clean set&quot; from producers to reduce temptation, although his fellow cast members commented on his hyperactivity and need for attention. Haim came to the set on his days off.

== Personal life ==
During the filming of &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, Haim bonded with Corey Feldman as they stayed in the hotel watching movies and visited the local arcade. The two became best friends.

Following the release of &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, Haim visibly embraced the privileges of his new-found fame, becoming a regular at Alphy&#x27;s Soda Pop Club, a private nightclub for underage actors at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.

In February 1993, Michael Bass reported to police that Haim had threatened him during an argument. Haim was arrested. According to Haim&#x27;s publicist at the time, he was shooting BB guns at a target in his backyard while trying to fire Bass, who refused to accept that he was being let go. Initially investigated as a terrorist threat (a felony), Haim&#x27;s charge was downgraded to the misdemeanor of exhibiting a replica handgun in a threatening manner. Feldman posted Haim&#x27;s $250 bail.

By late July 2008, Haim had become destitute and homeless in Los Angeles. He was taken in by singer-songwriter Gerard McMahon, who wrote &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot; for &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; soundtrack. They developed an idea for a reality show called &quot;Lost Boy Found&quot;, documenting Haim&#x27;s addiction and recovery through music at Mac&#x27;s studio, where he had been given a place to stay.

Despite their close bond in their early years of fame, Haim and Feldman had a number of disagreements in Haim&#x27;s later years. Many of these disputes occurred due to Haim&#x27;s drug use, which was documented in the reality series &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;. Before his death, Haim reconciled with Feldman off-camera. The two were spending time together developing a sequel to &quot;License to Drive&quot; called &quot;License to Fly&quot;, a project of Haim&#x27;s conception.

===Substance abuse===
Haim struggled with substance abuse for most of his life. He was already drinking beer in his early teens on the set of &quot;Lucas&quot; in 1985, and a year later, he tried marijuana on the set of &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. Haim asserted that the filming of &quot;License to Drive&quot; was his &quot;breaking point&quot; for becoming addicted to drugs. On his return from a Hawaiian family vacation in May 1989, Haim told the press that he had been clean for a month after going cold turkey without the help of a substance-abuse program.

Fellow &quot;Lost Boys&quot; actor Brooke McCarter began managing Haim in an effort to keep him clean. McCarter was dating Oscar-winning producer Julia Phillips, who termed the assignment &quot;babysitting&quot;. In her memoir, Phillips recalled Haim&#x27;s asking her permission to take out her daughter, and the moral conflict she experienced while smoking marijuana in front of him, saying: &quot;Mixed feelings about Corey. Love him. Detest him too, or at least the manipulative part that knew how to make people twice his age snap to. Are you really only eighteen? Who writes your dialogue&quot;?

During the filming of &quot;Without Malice&quot; (2000), Haim would reportedly halt production to call Toronto and check if his dog was dead, and sudden medical incidents required the filling of emergency prescriptions.

By 2001, Haim had sought rehabilitation 15 times for his drug addiction. He spent time in rehabilitation and was placed on prescription medication, which he began to abuse. On August 10, 2001, his mother found him unconscious at his Los Angeles bungalow. He was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center where doctors managed to stabilize him. Two weeks earlier, from July 23, 2001, Haim had spent some time in Sherman Oaks Hospital.

Feldman said of Haim: &quot;He made so many attempts at suicide. He&#x27;s ODd so many times. I mean, I can&#x27;t begin to tell you, having him foaming at the mouth, coming downstairs and finding him that way and drooling and not able to speak, and me, having to put charcoal down his throat so that he could breathe.&quot;

Haim stated that at one point, he did not leave his apartment for three and a half years and ballooned from 150 to 302 pounds. By 2004, Haim appeared to have overcome his drug habit after his mother persuaded him to return to Toronto with her and resettle there.

Feldman vowed that he would no longer speak to Haim until he got clean. On &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;, Feldman and his wife, along with two other former teen stars, called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help. Feldman added that he did not consider Haim to be &quot;a safe person to have around my wife and child at the moment&quot;. After his falling-out with Feldman, Haim had a car accident while under the influence and walked out for good on the show&#x27;s therapist. Publicly severing his ties with Haim, Feldman stated: &quot;I am not going to watch him destroy himself.&quot;

On the advice of his lawyer, Haim went to a physician in California with the goal of sticking to a program to wean off pills without multiple doctors in order to demonstrate that he was working toward getting clean. Haim&#x27;s agent stated that the doctor was reluctant to drop Haim from his current level to zero pills, fearing a seizure, and took him to an addiction specialist to get mental help.

===Relationships===
Haim never married nor had any children. He was involved with &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; actress Alyssa Milano from 1987 to 1990. Milano and her parents, together with his manager at the time, unsuccessfully tried to get Haim help for his addiction.

Lala Sloatman co-starred with Haim in &quot;Watchers&quot; (1988) and &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1989), and they dated on and off for two years at the peak of his fame.

Haim was engaged to &quot;Baywatch&quot; actress Nicole Eggert, with whom he starred in &quot;Blown Away&quot; (1992) and &quot;Just One of the Girls&quot; (1993). Eggert is credited with helping to save Haim&#x27;s life at least once by taking him to hospital to detox during a &quot;narcotic rush&quot;. Eggert once said: &quot;I spent a lot of nights in emergency rooms with him. I don&#x27;t think that I saved his life, I just think that I was there for him&quot;.

Haim was briefly engaged to actress Holly Fields in 1996 and to model Cindy Guyer in 2000.

Haim had a year-long relationship with actress Tiffany Shepis. In October 2008, he stated that the two were engaged and due to marry on May 9, 2009.

===Claims of abuse===
In an episode of &quot;The Two Coreys&quot;, Haim told Feldman that he had been sexually abused at the age of 14 by one of Feldman&#x27;s acquaintances. Declining to identify his molester (a 42-year-old man), Haim said that the abuse had continued for two years with Feldman&#x27;s knowledge. This disclosure led to a further rift between Haim and Feldman, and the show continued to expose the darker side of their lives as teen stars.

In 2011, after Haim&#x27;s death, Feldman stated that a &quot;Hollywood mogul&quot; who abused Haim was to blame for his death. Feldman&#x27;s 2013 memoir, &quot;Coreyography&quot;, stated that he and Haim suffered sexual abuse as young actors in the film industry. Feldman stated that during the filming of &quot;Lucas&quot;, Haim &quot;had been tricked into engaging in a painful session of anal sex by a man on the movie set. The man told Haim that sex between men and boys was normal in Hollywood&quot;. Feldman reported that after this experience, Haim suggested that he and Feldman engage in sexual relations, and Feldman declined.

In 2016, Judy Haim threatened to sue Feldman. Haim claimed that many of his statements were false and added that Feldman was looking for attention and money. In 2017, Judy Haim again spoke out against Feldman, who was seeking $10 million to make a documentary exposing those who had allegedly sexually abused him and her son; Judy Haim referred to Feldman as a &quot;scam artist&quot;.

In a 2017 interview from the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, actor Dominick Brascia alleged that Charlie Sheen was the person who had raped Haim on the set of &quot;Lucas&quot;. Sheen was 19 at the time, while Haim was 13. Sheen denied these allegations and filed a lawsuit against the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; that was settled in 2018. In a 2017 interview on &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot;, Judy Haim denied that Charlie Sheen was sexually involved with her son and accused Brascia, who died in 2018, of having sexually abused him.

In March 2020, Feldman&#x27;s documentary, &quot;My Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys&quot;, was released. Feldman alleged that Sheen had raped Haim and added that Haim had described the incident in graphic detail. These claims were backed up in the documentary by Jamison Newlander, Haim&#x27;s friend and co-star in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, and Feldman&#x27;s ex-wife Susie Sprague. Feldman accused Brascia of having sexually abused Haim as well. Feldman also spoke out against Judy Haim&#x27;s attacks on his credibility. Sheen&#x27;s publicist denied the abuse allegations.

==Death==
On March 10, 2010, after Haim&#x27;s mother phoned 911, paramedics took Haim from their home to Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. He was 38 years old. The 10-minute 911 call made by Haim&#x27;s mother was leaked on the Internet. Haim had been ill with flu-like symptoms for two days before his death. A doctor called on him and took his temperature, but did not suspect serious problems. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said: &quot;As he got out of bed, he felt a little weak and went down to the floor on his knees.&quot;

Los Angeles police initially stated that Haim&#x27;s death appeared to be an accidental overdose; bottles containing Valium, Vicodin, Soma (a muscle relaxant), and Haloperidol (an antipsychotic) were retrieved. It emerged that Haim had used illegal aliases to procure over 553 prescription pills in the 32 days before his death, having &quot;doctor-shopped&quot; seven different physicians and used seven pharmacies to obtain the supply. The pills included 195 Valium, 149 Vicodin, 194 Soma and 15 Xanax. Haim&#x27;s agent discounted the possibility of an overdose, citing his recent drive toward clean living and affirming that he had been completely drug-free for two weeks. However, Haim&#x27;s primary doctor confirmed to Drug Enforcement Administration investigators that Haim was addicted to pain medication.

California Attorney General Jerry Brown announced that his office was investigating Haim&#x27;s death, saying an unauthorized prescription in his name had been found among fraudulent prescription pads ordered from San Diego. On March 17, 2010, Brown announced that an arrest was made in connection with the investigation, which involved doctor-identity theft and up to 5,000 illegal prescriptions. While detailed information was not released, officials stated that Haim had obtained Oxycontin via a prescription drug ring. Records showed he had received thousands of pills over the last year of his life, using physicians at offices, urgent-care facilities and emergency rooms.

On May 4, 2010, the L.A. County Coroner&#x27;s office autopsy report revealed that Haim died of diffuse alveolar damage and pneumonia, together with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and coronary arteriosclerosis. The death was ruled a natural death. As to the question of whether drugs were involved, the coroner stated: &quot;the toxicology report revealed no significant contributing factor&quot;. Before the autopsy report was released publicly, Haim&#x27;s mother stated that the coroner had given her a &quot;courtesy call&quot; to state his preliminary findings that Haim died of pulmonary edema and was suffering from an enlarged heart and water in the lungs. Haim&#x27;s death certificate lists &quot;Diffuse Alveolar Damage&quot; and &quot;Community Acquired Pneumonia&quot; as causes of death, with &quot;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy With Coronary Arteriosclerosis&quot; listed as other conditions contributing but not related to the immediate cause of death.

On March 25, 2010, approximately twenty doctors were subpoenaed in connection with Haim&#x27;s case. Haim had claimed to each that he was not seeing any other doctors, and many reported feeling &quot;duped&quot; by him. Attorney General Brown called Haim the &quot;poster child&quot; for prescription drug addiction.

===Funeral and aftermath===
A private Jewish funeral ceremony for Haim took place on March 16, 2010, at Steeles Memorial Chapel in Thornhill, Ontario. Both of Haim&#x27;s parents attended, along with 200 friends and family. A dozen fans waited outside. In an open letter written to Haim on that day, Corey Feldman stated his wish to stay away from the funeral to minimize publicity for the family; he said, &quot;I always feared this day would come&quot;.

Haim died with very little money, and his mother initially announced that the cost of his funeral would be covered by public funds provided by the city of Toronto as is customary in destitute cases. However, city officials stated that no paperwork had been submitted by the family, who entreated fans to help provide for the burial in an online appeal for funds. A $20,000 contribution was made by a memorabilia site to which Haim had sold items over the years, but the company later put a stop payment on the check after it emerged that the funeral home had stepped in to cover the costs from the outset. Haim&#x27;s personal effects were put up for auction on eBay by a cast member from &quot;A Time to Live&quot;, whose listings claimed that the family had asked him to sell the items as they needed money for burial expenses.

Haim&#x27;s body was buried at Pardes Shalom Cemetery in the Maple neighborhood of Vaughan, in the York Region of Ontario, Canada.

==Posthumous==
Haim was omitted from the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; tribute montage at both the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards and the 83rd Academy Awards in the year following his death. Perceived by the press as a &quot;snub&quot;, Haim&#x27;s omission from the Oscars received widespread media coverage. Corey Feldman said the snub showed that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn&#x27;t &quot;have a handle on who the public adores.&quot;

Haim was the subject of a TV program, &quot;Autopsy: The Last Hours of Corey Haim&quot;, which premiered on November 23, 2016, on the Reelz channel.

<doc id="248555" wikidata="Q468778" url="?curid=248555" title="Campsis radicans">
<text>Campsis radicans, the trumpet vine, yellow trumpet vine, or trumpet creeper (also known in North America as cow-itch vine or hummingbird vine), is a species of flowering plant in the trumpet vine family Bignoniaceae, native to eastern North America, and naturalized elsewhere. Growing to , it is a vigorous, deciduous woody vine, notable for its showy trumpet-shaped flowers. It inhabits woodlands and riverbanks, and is also a popular garden plant.
==Description==
&quot;C. radicans&quot; is a vine that climbs on trees, other plants, or structures or trails along the ground and can grow to a length of up to . From the main vine, rigid or woody arching vines up to long extend outward. The plant can form a dense groundcover or an aggressive liana covering plants or buildings. The leaves are opposite and odd-pinnately compound, meaning there is an odd number of leaflets, with one terminal leaflet. 

Leaves are up to long with 7 to 13 leaflets that are each about long and wide. The leaflets are emerald green when new, maturing into a shiny dark green. They are ovate to broadly lanceolate and the edges are coarsely serrate. 

===Inflorescences=== 
The flowers come in terminal cymes of two to eight. Each flower is up to long and trumpet shaped. They are orange to reddish orange in color with a yellowish throat and 5 shallow lobes bending backward. They generally appear after several months of warm weather. The flowers have no floral scent. After flowering, a long seed capsule about long appears, eventually splitting in two to disperse its seeds. 

== Taxonomy ==
The flamboyant flowering of &quot;Campsis radicans&quot; made it obvious to even the least botanically-minded of the first English colonists in Virginia. Consequently, the plant quickly made its way to England early in the 17th century. 

Its botanical parentage, as a hardy member of a mostly subtropical group, made its naming problematic: according to John Parkinson, the Virginia settlers were at first calling it a jasmine or a honeysuckle, and then a bellflower; he classed it in the genus &quot;Apocynum&quot; (dogbane). Joseph Pitton de Tournefort erected a catch-all genus &quot;Bignonia&quot; in 1700, from which it has since been extricated.

== Etymology ==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;radicans&quot; means &#x27;with stems that take root&#x27;. The plant is commonly known as cow-itch vine because skin redness and itching is experienced by some people after coming in contact with the leaves.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Campsis radicans&quot; is native to the eastern United States and extreme southern Ontario in Canada. It is naturalized in parts of the western United States as well as in Ontario and southern Quebec, parts of Europe, and scattered locations in Latin America.

==Ecology==
The flowers bloom in the summer for about three months and are very attractive to hummingbirds such as the ruby-throated hummingbird, while many types of birds like to nest in the dense foliage. Halictid bees, flies, and ants also feed on the nectar of the plant&#x27;s extra-floral nectaries. Nectar robbing behavior has been observed to be performed by orchard orioles (&quot;Icterus spurius&quot;), which puncture and enlarge holes in the flower base to access nectaries. Certain sphinx moths with elongate proboscises are able to successfully feed on trumpet vines while hovering in front of the flower.

The flowers are followed by large seed pods. As these mature, they dry and split. Hundreds of thin, brown, paper-like seeds are released. These are easily grown when stratified. Larvae of &quot;Clydonopteron sacculana&quot; (the trumpet vine moth) feed on the seed pods.

==Cultivation==
The trumpet vine grows vigorously. In warm weather, it puts out aerial rootlets that grab onto every available surface, and eventually expand into heavy woody stems several centimeters in diameter. It grows well on arbors, fences, telephone poles, and trees, although it may dismember them in the process. Ruthless pruning is recommended. Outside of its native range this species has the potential to be invasive, even as far north as New England. The trumpet vine thrives in many places in southern Canada as well.

Away from summer heat, &quot;C. radicans&quot; is less profuse of flower. A larger-flowered hybrid &#x27;Mme Galen&#x27; was introduced about 1889 by the Tagliabue nurserymen of Lainate near Milan.

The form &quot;C. radicans&quot; f. &quot;flava&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

A deeper red form &quot;Flamenco&quot; is available.

== Toxicity ==
The plant can cause contact dermatitis.

<doc id="248559" wikidata="Q265595" url="?curid=248559" title="Rosemary Kennedy">
<text>Rose Marie &quot;Rosemary&quot; Kennedy (September 13, 1918 – January 7, 2005) was the eldest daughter born to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. She was a sister of President John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. and Ted Kennedy.

As a child, she reportedly exhibited developmental delays. In her young adult years, Kennedy was &quot;becoming increasingly irritable and difficult.&quot; In response to these issues, her father arranged a lobotomy on her in 1941, when she was 23 years of age. The procedure left her permanently incapacitated and rendered her unable to speak intelligibly.

She spent most of the rest of her life being cared for at St. Coletta, an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin. The truth about her situation and whereabouts was kept secret for decades. While she was initially isolated from her siblings and extended family following her lobotomy, she did go on to visit them during her later life.

==Family and early life==

Rosemary Kennedy was born at her parents&#x27; home in Brookline, Massachusetts on September 13, 1918. She was the third child and first daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald. She was named after her mother and was commonly called Rosemary or Rosie. During her birth, the doctor was not immediately available because of an outbreak of the Spanish influenza epidemic and the nurse ordered Rose Kennedy to keep her legs closed, forcing the baby&#x27;s head to stay in the birth canal for two hours. The action resulted in a harmful loss of oxygen. As Rosemary began to grow, her parents noticed she was not reaching the basic developmental steps a human normally reaches at a certain month or year. At two years old, she had a hard time sitting up, crawling, and learning to walk.

Accounts of Kennedy&#x27;s life indicated that she had an intellectual disability, although some have raised questions about the Kennedys&#x27; accounts of the nature and scope of her disability. A biographer wrote that Rose Kennedy did not confide in her friends and that she pretended her daughter was developing typically, with relatives other than the immediate family knowing nothing of Rosemary&#x27;s disability. Despite the help of tutors, Rosemary had trouble learning to read and write. At age 11, she was sent to a Pennsylvania boarding school for people with intellectual disabilities.

At age 16, Kennedy was sent to the Sacred Heart Convent in Elmhurst, Providence, Rhode Island, where she was educated separately from the other students. Two nuns and a special teacher, Miss Newton, worked with her all day in a separate classroom. The Kennedys gave the school a new tennis court for their efforts. Her reading, writing, spelling, and counting skills were reported to be at a fourth-grade level (ages 9–10). During this period, her mother arranged for her older brother John to accompany her to a tea dance. Thanks to him, she appeared &quot;not different at all&quot; during the dance.

Rosemary read few books but could read &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. Diaries written by her in the late 1930s, and published in the 1980s, reveal a young woman whose life was filled with outings to the opera, tea dances, dress fittings, and other social interests. Kennedy accompanied her family to the coronation of Pope Pius XII in Rome in 1939. She also visited the White House. Kennedy&#x27;s parents told &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; that she was &quot;studying to be a kindergarten teacher,&quot; and &quot;Parents&quot; was told that while she had &quot;an interest in social welfare work, she is said to harbor a secret longing to go on the stage.&quot; When &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; requested an interview with Rosemary, her father&#x27;s assistant prepared a response which Rosemary copied out laboriously:

I have always had serious tastes and understand life is not given us just for enjoyment. For some time past, I have been studying the well known psychological method of Dr. Maria Montessori and I got my degree in teaching last year.

In 1938, Kennedy was presented as a debutante to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace during her father&#x27;s service as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Kennedy practiced the complicated royal curtsy for hours. At the event, she tripped and nearly fell. Rose Kennedy never discussed the incident and treated the debut as a triumph. The crowd made no sign, and the King and the Queen smiled as if nothing had happened.

==Lobotomy==
According to Kennedy&#x27;s sister Eunice, when Rosemary returned to the United States from the United Kingdom in 1940, she became &quot;increasingly irritable and difficult&quot; at the age of 22. Kennedy would often experience convulsions and fly into violent rages, during which she would hit and injure others. After being expelled from a summer camp in western Massachusetts and staying only a few months at a Philadelphia boarding school, Kennedy was sent to a convent school in Washington, D.C. Kennedy began sneaking out of the convent school at night. The nuns at the convent thought that Rosemary might be involved with sexual partners and that she could contract a sexually transmitted disease or become pregnant. Her occasionally erratic behavior frustrated her parents; her father was especially worried that Kennedy&#x27;s behavior would shame and embarrass the family and damage his and his children&#x27;s political careers.

When Kennedy was 23 years old, doctors told her father that a lobotomy would help calm her mood swings and stop her occasional violent outbursts. Joe Sr. decided that Rosemary should have a lobotomy; however, he did not inform his wife of this decision until after the procedure was completed. The procedure took place in November 1941. In Ronald Kessler&#x27;s 1996 biography of Joe Sr., &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, James W. Watts, who carried out the procedure with Walter Freeman (both of George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences), described the procedure to Kessler as follows:

Watts told Kessler that in his opinion, Kennedy did not have &quot;mental retardation&quot; but rather a form of depression. A review of all of the papers written by the two doctors confirmed Watts&#x27; declaration. All of the patients the two doctors lobotomized were diagnosed as having some form of mental disorder. Bertram S. Brown, director of the National Institute of Mental Health who was previously an aide to President Kennedy, told Kessler that Joe Kennedy referred to his daughter Rosemary as mentally retarded rather than mentally ill in order to protect John&#x27;s reputation for a presidential run and that the family&#x27;s &quot;lack of support for mental illness is part of a lifelong family denial of what was really so&quot;. It was quickly apparent that the procedure had caused immense harm. Kennedy&#x27;s mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child. She could not walk or speak intelligibly and was incontinent.

===Aftermath===
After the lobotomy, Kennedy was immediately institutionalized. She initially lived for several years at Craig House, a private psychiatric hospital 90 minutes north of New York City. In 1949, she was relocated to Jefferson, Wisconsin, where she lived for the rest of her life on the grounds of the St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children (formerly known as &quot;St. Coletta Institute for Backward Youth&quot;). Archbishop Richard Cushing of Boston had told her father about St. Coletta&#x27;s, an institution for more than 300 people with disabilities, and her father traveled to and built a private house for her about a mile outside St. Coletta&#x27;s main campus near Alverno House, which was designed for adults who needed lifelong care. The nuns called the house &quot;the Kennedy cottage&quot;. Two Catholic nuns, Sister Margaret Ann and Sister Leona, provided her care along with a student and a woman who worked on ceramics with Kennedy three nights a week. Kennedy had a car that could be used to take her for rides and a dog which she could take on walks.

In response to her condition, Kennedy&#x27;s parents separated her from her family. Rose Kennedy did not visit her for 20 years. Joe Sr. did not visit his daughter at the institution at all. In &quot;Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter,&quot; author Kate Clifford Larson stated that Kennedy&#x27;s lobotomy was hidden from the family for 20 years; none of her siblings knew of her whereabouts. While her older brother John was campaigning for re-election to the U.S. Senate in 1958, the Kennedy family explained away her absence by claiming she was reclusive. The family did not publicly explain her absence until 1961, after John had been elected president. The Kennedys did not reveal that she was institutionalized because of a failed lobotomy, but instead said that she was deemed &quot;mentally retarded&quot;. In 1961, after Joe Sr. had a stroke that left him unable to speak and walk, Rosemary&#x27;s siblings were made aware of her location.

Rosemary&#x27;s condition was revealed publicly by her sister Eunice in a 1962 interview to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, but her lobotomy did not become public knowledge until 1987, when historian Doris Kearns Goodwin revealed it in her book &quot;The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys&quot;.

==Later life==
Following her father&#x27;s death in 1969, the Kennedys gradually involved Rosemary in family life again. She was occasionally taken to visit relatives in Florida and Washington, D.C., as well as her childhood home on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. By that time, Rosemary had learned to walk again, but did so with a limp. She never regained the ability to speak clearly and her arm was palsied. Her condition is sometimes credited as the inspiration for Eunice Kennedy Shriver to later found the Special Olympics, although Shriver told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1995 that Kennedy was just one of the disabled people she would have over to her house to swim, and that the games should not focus on any single individual.

Kennedy died from natural causes on January 7, 2005, aged 86, at the Fort Atkinson Memorial Hospital in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, with her siblings (sisters Jean, Eunice, and Patricia and brother Ted) by her side. She was buried beside her parents at Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts.

<text>A Black Mass is a ceremony celebrated by various Satanic groups. It has allegedly existed for centuries in different forms, and the modern form is intentionally a sacrilegious and blasphemous parody of a Catholic Mass.

In the 19th century the Black Mass became popularized in French literature, in books such as &quot;Satanism and Witchcraft&quot;, by Jules Michelet, and , by Joris-Karl Huysmans.

Modern revivals began with H. T. F. Rhodes&#x27; book &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot; published in London in 1954, and there is now a range of modern versions of the Black Mass performed by various groups.

== History==
=== Early Catholicism ===
The Catholic Church regards the Mass as its most important ritual, going back to apostolic times. In general, its various liturgies followed the outline of Liturgy of the Word, Offertory, Liturgy of the Eucharist and Benediction, which developed into what is known as the Mass. However, as early Christianity became more established and its influence began to spread, the early Church Fathers began to describe a few heretical groups practicing their own versions of Masses. Some of these rituals were of a sexual nature. The fourth-century AD heresiologist Epiphanius of Salamis, for instance, claims that a libertine Gnostic sect known as the Borborites engaged in a version of the Eucharist in which they would smear their hands with menstrual blood and semen and consume them as the blood and body of Christ respectively. He also alleges that, whenever one of the women in their church was experiencing her period, they would take her menstrual blood and everyone in the church would eat it as part of a sacred ritual. Saint Augustine, also writing in the fourth century, describes a group referred to as &quot;Catharistas&quot; (&quot;purifiers&quot;), who added the mixture of male and female sexual fluids to flour to create a &quot;Sacrament&quot; which they ate, in the belief that they were purifying the substance through eating it.

=== Medieval Roman Catholic parodies and additions to the Mass ===

Within the Church, the rite of the Mass was not completely fixed, and there were places at the end of the Offertory for the &quot;Secret&quot; prayers, when the priest could insert private prayers for various personal needs. These practices became especially prevalent in France . As these types of personal prayers within the Mass spread, the institution of the Low Mass became quite common, where priests would hire their services out to perform various Masses for the needs of their clients (Votive Masses)—such as blessing crops or cattle, achieving success in some enterprise, obtaining love, or even cursing enemies (one way this latter was done was by inserting the enemy&#x27;s name in a Mass for the dead, accompanied by burying an image of the enemy). Although these practices were condemned by Church authorities as superstitious and sacrilegious abuses, they still occurred secretively. In the 12th and 13th centuries there was a great surplus of clerics and monks who might be inclined to perform these Masses, as younger sons were often sent off to religious universities, and after their studies, needed to find a livelihood. Also within the Church, the ritual of the Mass was sometimes reworked to create light-hearted parodies of it for certain festivities. Some of these became quasi-tolerated practices at times—though never accepted by official Church authorities—such as a festive parody of the Mass called &quot;The Feast of Asses&quot;, in which Balaam&#x27;s ass (from the Old Testament) would begin talking and saying parts of the Mass. A similar parody was the Feast of Fools. Though often condemned, practitioners of such activities, called &quot;Goliards&quot;, continued despite the Church&#x27;s disapproval.
Another result of the surplus of (sometimes disillusioned) clerical students was the appearance of the Latin writings of the Goliards and wandering clerics (clerici vagantes). There began to appear more cynical and heretical parodies of the Mass, also written in ecclesiastical Latin, known as &quot;drinkers&#x27; Masses&quot; and &quot;gamblers&#x27; Masses,&quot; which lamented the situation of drunk, gambling monks, and instead of calling to &quot;Deus&quot; (God), called to &quot;Bacchus&quot; (the Roman god of wine) and &quot;Decius&quot; (the god of dice, which were used in gambling). Some of the earliest of these Latin parody works are found in the medieval Latin collection of poetry, &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, written around 1230. At the time these wandering clerics were spreading their Latin writings and parodies of the Mass, the Cathars, who also spread their teachings through wandering clerics, were also active. Due to the proximity in time and location of the Goliards, the Cathars, and the witches, all of whom were seen as threatening the authority of the Catholic Church and its head, the Papacy in Rome, some historians have postulated that these wandering clerics may have at times offered their services for performing heretical, or &quot;black&quot; Masses on various occasions.

A further source of late Medieval and Early Modern involvement with parodies and alterations of the Mass were the writings of the European witch-hunt, which saw witches as being agents of the Devil, who were described as inverting the Christian Mass and employing the stolen Host for diabolical ends. Witch-hunter&#x27;s manuals such as the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (1487) and the &quot;Compendium Maleficarum&quot; (1608) allude to these supposed practices. The first complete depiction of a blasphemy of the Mass in connection with the witches&#x27; sabbath, was given in Florimond de Raemond&#x27;s 1597 French work, &quot;The Antichrist&quot; (written as a Catholic response to the Protestant claim that the Pope was the Antichrist). He uses the following description of a witches&#x27; meeting as a sign that Satanic practices are prevalent in the world, and a sign that the Antichrist&#x27;s power is on the rise:

The most sophisticated and detailed descriptions of the Black Mass to have been produced in early modern Europe are found in the Basque witch-hunts of 1609–1614. It has recently been argued by academics including Emma Wilby that the emphasis on the Black Mass in these trials evolved out of a particularly creative interaction between interrogators keen to find evidence of the rite and a Basque peasantry who were deeply committed to a wide range of unorthodox religious practices such as &quot;cursing&quot; Masses, liturgical misrule and the widespread misuse of Catholic ritual elements in forbidden magical conjurations. An impressive account of the rite was given by suspects from the Spanish-Basque village of Zugarramurdi, who claimed that:

=== Early modern France ===

Between the 16th and the 19th centuries, many examples of interest in the Black Mass come from France.

* 16th century: Catherine de&#x27; Medici, the Queen of France, was said by Jean Bodin to have performed a Black Mass, based on a story in his 1580 book on witchcraft &quot;De la démonomanie des sorciers&quot;. In spite of its lurid details, there is little outside evidence to back up his story.
* 17th century: Catherine Monvoisin and the priest Étienne Guibourg performed &quot;Black Masses&quot; for Madame de Montespan, the mistress of King Louis XIV of France. Since a criminal investigation—&quot;L&#x27;affaire des poisons&quot; (&quot;Affair of the Poisons&quot;)—was launched (resulting in the execution of Monvoisin and the imprisonment of Guibourg) many details of their Black Mass have come down to us. It was a typical Roman Catholic Mass, but modified according to certain formulas (some reminiscent of the Latin &quot;Sworn Book of Honorius&quot;, or its French version, &quot;The Grimoire of Pope Honorius&quot;) and featuring the King&#x27;s mistress (the Marquise de Montespan) as the central altar of worship, lying naked upon the altar with the chalice on her bare stomach, and holding a black candle in each of her outstretched arms. The Host was consecrated on her body, and then used in love potions designed to gain the love of the King (on account of the magical power believed to be in the consecrated Host). From these images of the Guibourg Mass, further developments of the Black Mass derived.
* 18th century: The Marquis de Sade, in many of his writings, places the Host and the Mass, monks, priests and the Pope himself (Pope Pius VI in &quot;Juliette&quot;) in blasphemous sexual settings.
* 19th century: Joris-Karl Huysmans wrote the classic novel of French Satanism, &quot;Là-bas&quot; (1891). The characters in the novel have long discussions on the history of French Satanism up to their time, and eventually one of them is invited to participate in a Black Mass, the type of which Huysmans claimed was practised in Paris in those years. Although a work of fiction, Huysmans&#x27; description of the Black Mass remained influential simply because no other book went into as much detail. However, the actual text which Huysmans&#x27; satanic &quot;priest&quot; recites is nothing more than a long diatribe in French, praising Satan as the god of reason and the opponent of Christianity. In this way, it resembles the French poetry of Charles Baudelaire (in particular &quot;Les Litanies de Satan&quot;), more than it resembles an inversion of the Roman Catholic Mass.

=== Late 19th century and early 20th century scholarly interest in the Black Mass ===

Scholarly studies on the Black Mass relied almost completely on French and Latin sources (which also came from France):

* The French historian Jules Michelet was one of the first to analyze and attempt to understand the Black Mass, and wrote two chapters about it in his classic book, &quot;Satanism and Witchcraft&quot; (1862).
* J. G. Frazer included a description of the Mass of Saint-Sécaire, an unusual French legend with similarities to the Black Mass, in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890). Frazer was recounting material already found in an 1883 French book entitled &quot;Quatorze superstitions populaires de la Gascogne&quot; (&quot;Fourteen Popular Superstitions of Gascony&quot;), by Jean-François Bladé. This Mass was said to be employed as a method of assassination by supernatural means, allowing the supplicant to avenge himself if he was wronged by someone.
* Montague Summers discussed many classic portrayals of the Black Mass in a number of his works (especially in &quot;The History of Witchcraft and Demonology&quot; (1926), ch. IV, &quot;The Sabbat&quot;, with extensive quotations from the original French and Latin sources).

=== 20th century ===

* H. T. F. Rhodes&#x27; popular book, &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot;, published in London in 1954 (American edition in 1955), was a major inspiration for modern versions of the Black Mass, when they finally appeared. Rhodes claimed that, at the time of his writing, there did not exist a single first hand source which actually described the rites and ceremonies of a Black Mass.
* Gerhard Zacharias and Richard Cavendish, both writing in the middle of the 1960s, while presenting detailed studies of source material, offer no new sources for a Black Mass, relying solely on material that was already known to Rhodes.
* When Anton Szandor LaVey published his &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; in 1969, he wrote that: He went on in the &quot;Satanic Rituals&quot; (1972) to present it as the most representatively satanic ritual in the book.

=== 21st century ===

* In 2014 the Black Mass was held in public at the Oklahoma City Civic Center by a theistic Satanist group called Dakhma of Angra Mainyu (Church of Ahriman). The host to be used in the Black Mass was stolen from a Catholic church. The event saw backlash in the form of protesters such as John Ritchie, the Director of TFP Student Action.
* Dakhma of Angra Mainyu, the same theistic Satanist group, held another Black Mass in 2016 at the same location. An ecumenical Christian protest (with Christians from many denominations, such as Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal and Pentecostal, present) was held to oppose the Black Mass.

== The modern Black Mass ==
In spite of the huge amount of French literature discussing the Black Mass () at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, no set of written instructions for performing one, from any purported group of Satanists, turned up in writing until the 1960s, and appeared not in France, but in the United States. As can be seen from these first Black Masses and Satanic Masses appearing in the U.S., the creators drew heavily from occult novelists such as Dennis Wheatley and Joris-Karl Huysmans, and from non-fiction occult writers popular in the 1960s, such as Grillot de Givry, author of the popular illustrated book &quot;Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy&quot;, and H. T. F. Rhodes, who provided a title for the satanic ritual in his 1954 book &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot;. Herbert Sloane, the founder of an early Satanist group, the Ophite Cultus Satanas, speaks of Satanists performing the ritual of the &quot;Satanic Mass&quot; in a letter he wrote in 1968 , and in 1968 and 1969 also appeared the first two recordings of Satanic rituals, both entitled the &quot;Satanic Mass&quot;:

* The first was a 13-minute recording of a full-length &quot;Satanic Mass&quot; made by the U.S. band Coven. Coven&#x27;s Satanic Mass, part of their stage show beginning in 1967, was expanded and included on their 1969 record album &quot;Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls&quot;, together with the full published text. On the album cover, it is stated that they spent a long time researching the material, and to their knowledge it was the first Black Mass published in any language. The result was eclectic, drawing chants and material from numerous sources, including two medieval French miracle plays, &quot;Le Miracle de Théophile&quot; and &quot;Jeu de Saint Nicolas&quot;, which both contain invocations to the Devil in an unknown language. These chants, along with other material on the album, could be found in books on witchcraft popular in the 60s, notably Grillot de Givry&#x27;s &quot;Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy&quot; (originally published in France in 1929). A large portion of the English dialogue was taken verbatim from Dennis Wheatley&#x27;s 1960 occult novel, &quot;The Satanist&quot;, in which the female protagonist is initiated into a Satanic cult. Additionally, the recording, while using a couple of the Latin phrases the Church of Satan was already making popular, also added a substantial amount of church Latin, in the form of Gregorian chants sung by the band, to create the genuine effect of the Catholic Latin Mass being inverted and sung to Satan.
* The second was a record album of readings in Satanic ritual and philosophy by the Church of Satan, called &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot;, which contained material later to appear in their &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; (published in 1969). In spite of the title and a few phrases in Latin, this album did not deal with the traditional Black Mass.

Soon after Coven created their Satanic Mass recording, the Church of Satan began creating their own Black Masses, two of which are available to the public. The first, created for the Church of Satan by Wayne West in 1970, was entitled &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; (named after the Missa Solemnis version of the Latin Mass; originally published only in pamphlet form, later published in Michael Aquino&#x27;s history of &quot;The Church of Satan&quot;), and the second, created by an unknown author, was entitled &quot;Le Messe Noir&quot; (published in Anton LaVey&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;).

All three of these newly created Black Masses (the one by Coven and the two by the Church of Satan) contain the Latin phrase &quot;In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi&quot; (In the name of our God, Satan Lucifer of the Most High), as well as the phrases &quot;Rege Satanas&quot; and &quot;Ave Satanas&quot; (which, incidentally, are also the only three Latin phrases which appeared in the Church of Satan&#x27;s 1968 recording, &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot;). Additionally, all three modify other Latin parts of the Roman Catholic Missal to make them into Satanic versions. The Church of Satan&#x27;s two Black Masses also use the French text of the Black Mass in Huysmans&#x27; &quot;Là-Bas&quot; to a great extent. (West only uses the English translation, LaVey publishes also the original French). Thus, the Black Mass found in &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot; is a combination of English, French, and Latin. Further, in keeping with the traditional description of the Black Mass, all three also require a consecrated Host taken from a Catholic church, as a central part of the ceremony.

A writer using the pseudonym &quot;Aubrey Melech&quot; published, in 1986, a Black Mass entirely in Latin, entitled &quot;Missa Niger&quot;. (This Black Mass is available on the Internet). Aubrey Melech&#x27;s Black Mass contains almost exactly the same original Latin phrases as the Black Mass published by LaVey in &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;. The difference is that the amount of Latin has now more than doubled, so that the entire Black Mass is in Latin. Unlike Coven and Wayne West, LaVey and Melech do not give the source for the Latin material in their Black Mass, merely implying that they received it from someone else, without saying who.
=== The language of the Black Mass ===
The French sections that LaVey published were quotations from Huysmans&#x27;s &quot;Là-bas&quot;. The Latin of Melech and LaVey is based on the Roman Catholic Latin Missal, reworded so as to give it a Satanic meaning (e.g. the Roman Mass starts &quot;&quot;In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, introibo ad altare Dei&quot;, while LaVey&#x27;s version, printed in the &quot;Satanic Rituals&quot;, starts &quot;In nomine magni dei nostri Satanas, introibo ad altare Domini Inferi&quot;). There are a small amount of copyist and grammatical errors. For example, &quot;dignum&quot; from the Mass, is once incorrectly spelled &quot;clignum&quot;, in the printed &quot;Satanic Rituals&quot;. Another example, also appearing once, is &quot;laefificat&quot; instead of &quot;laetificat&quot;. One of the more obvious grammatical errors is &quot;ego vos benedictio&quot;&quot;, &quot;I bless you&quot;, which should have been &quot;ego vos benedico&quot;. Another grammatical peculiarity is that, throughout his version of the Mass, LaVey does not decline the name Satanas, as is typically done in Latin if the endings are used, but uses only the one form of the word regardless of the case. Melech uses &quot;Satanus&quot;. &quot;Satanas&quot; as a name for Satan appears in some examples of Latin texts popularly associated with satanism and witchcraft, such as the middle age pact with the Devil supposedly written by Urbain Grandier. Both Black Masses end with the Latin expression &quot;Ave, Satanas!&quot;—Meaning either &quot;Welcome, Satan!&quot;, or &quot;Hail Satan!&quot; (expressing the opposite sentiments of the similar statement made by Jesus to Satan in the Latin Vulgate Bible (Latin Vulgate, Matthew 4:10), &quot;Vade, Satanas!&quot;—&quot;Go away, Satan!&quot;).

<text>The is the period of Japanese history when the Imperial court ruled from modern-day Nara Prefecture, then known as Yamato Province.

While conventionally assigned to the period 250–710, including both the Kofun period (–538) and the Asuka period (538–710), the actual start of Yamato rule is disputed. The Yamato court&#x27;s supremacy was challenged during the Kofun period by other polities centered in various parts of Japan. What is certain is that Yamato clans had major advantages over their neighbouring clans in the 6th century. This period is divided by the relocation of the capital to Asuka, in modern Nara Prefecture. However, the Kofun period is an archaeological period while the Asuka period is a historical period. Therefore, many think of this as an old division and this concept of period division is no longer applicable.

At the era of Prince Shōtoku in the early 7th century, a new constitution was prescribed for Japan based on the Chinese model. After the fall of Baekje (660 AD), the Yamato government sent envoys directly to the Chinese court, from which they obtained a great wealth of Confucian philosophical and social structure. In addition to ethics and government, they also adopted the Chinese calendar and many of its religious practices, including Confucianism and Taoism (Japanese: Onmyo).

== Background of Yamato society and culture ==
A millennium earlier, the Japanese archipelago had been inhabited by the Jōmon people. In the centuries prior to the beginning of the Yamato period, elements of the Northeast Asian and Chinese civilizations had been introduced to the Japanese archipelago in waves of migration. According to &quot;Kojiki&quot;, the oldest record of Japan, Amenohiboko, Korean prince of Silla, came to Japan to serve the Japanese Emperor and he lived in Tajima Province. His descendant is believed to be Tajimamori. Archaeological evidence indicates contacts between mainland China, Korea, and Japan since prehistory of the Neolithic period, and its continuation also at least in the Kofun period.

The rice-growing, politically fragmented Yayoi culture either evolved into the new Japanese culture characterized by the more centralized, patriarchal, militaristic Kofun period or came to be dominated and eventually overrun by Yamato society.

By this time, Japonic had also spread to the Ryukyu Islands such as Okinawa. The Ryukyuan languages and Japanese most likely diverged during this period.

== Kofun period ==

The is an era in the history of Japan from around 250 to 538. The word &quot;kofun&quot; is Japanese for the type of burial mounds dating from this era.

During the Kofun period, elements of Chinese culture continued to influence culture in the Japanese archipelago, both through waves of migration and through trade, travel, and cultural change. Archaeological evidence indicates contacts between the mainland and Japan also during this period. Most scholars believe that there were massive transmissions of technology and culture from China via Korea peninsula to Japan which is evidenced by material artifacts in tombs of both states in the Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea and Kofun period, as well as the later wave of Baekje refugees to Yamato.

Archaeological records and ancient Chinese sources Book of Song indicate that the various tribes and chiefdom of the Japanese Archipelago did not begin to coalesce into more centralized and hierarchical polities until 300 (well into the Kofun period), when large tombs begin to appear while there were no contacts between the Wa and China. Some describe the &quot;mysterious century&quot; as a time of internecine warfare as various local monarchies competed for hegemony on Kyūshū and Honshū.

Japan of the Kofun age was positive in the introduction of Chinese culture. Several kinds of goods were imported. Books from China were one of the most important trade goods. Chinese philosophy that had been introduced in this era, had a big influence on the history of Japan. Decorated bronze mirrors (Shinju-kyo) were imported from China. Japan imported iron from Korean peninsula until the latter half of the 6th century.

In this period, Baekje received military support from Japan. According to the Samguk Sagi, King Asin of Baekje sent his son Jeonji to Japan in 397 and King Silseong of Silla sent his son Misaheun to Japan in 402 in order to solicit military aid.

===Kofun tombs===
&quot;Kofun&quot; (古墳, &quot;old tomb&quot;) are burial mounds which were built for the people of the ruling class during the 3rd to 7th centuries. The Kofun period takes its name from these distinctive earthen mounds which are associated with the rich funerary rituals of the time. The mounds contained large stone burial chambers. Some are surrounded by moats.

Kofun came in many shapes, with round and square being the simplest. A distinct style is the keyhole kofun (前方後円墳 &quot;zenpō kōen fun&quot;), with its square front and round back. Many kofuns were natural hills, which might have been sculpted to their final shape. Kofun range in size from several meters to over 400 meters in length.

By the late Kofun period, the distinctive burial chambers, originally used by the ruling elite, were also built for commoners.

The biggest kofun are believed to be the tombs of emperors like Emperor Ōjin (応神天皇 &quot;Ōjin Tennō&quot;) and Emperor Nintoku (仁徳天皇 &quot;Nintoku Tennō&quot;). Kofun are also classified according to whether the entrance to the stone burial chamber is vertical (縦穴 &quot;tate-ana&quot;) or horizontal (横穴 &quot;yoko-ana&quot;).

=== Immigrants in early Japan ===
Japan of the Kofun period was very receptive to influence from China. Chinese and Korean immigrants played an important role in introducing elements of Chinese culture to early Japan.

Yamato links to the mainland and the Liu Song dynasty in 425 and 478 were facilitated by the maritime knowledge and diplomatic connections of China and the Three Kingdoms of the Korean peninsula, especially Baekje.
Many important figures were immigrants from East Asia. Yamato Imperial Court officially edited the &quot;Shinsen Shōjiroku&quot; in 815 as a directory of aristocrats which lists 1182 names of clans which were in Kinai area, it lists a number of clans from Mainland Asia. According to the directory, 120 clans have roots in Baekje, 48 clans in Goguryeo, 17 clans in Silla, 9 clans in Gaya and the other 174 clans &quot;Kan (漢)&quot; (now obsolete general term for ancient Koreans) of the Korean peninsula.

The Azumi people were a warrior tribe from northern Kyushu. They were extremely skilled seafarers. The Azumi gained early contact with the Yamato Court and provided maritime trade links and influenced the Yamato Court&#x27;s military and diplomatic approach in the seas. Thus the Japanese imperial government employed them as their naval force from the 3rd to 5th centuries. Certain experts regard the Azumi as &quot;the oldest known maritime force of [Japan&#x27;s] emerging imperial state.&quot; Some Japanese historians think they were of Austronesian origin and related to the Hayato people who lived in southern Kyushu. The Yamato Court questioned their loyalty and banished them sometime before the 7th century.

===Kofun society===

The Kofun period was a critical stage in Japan&#x27;s evolution toward a more cohesive and recognized state. This society was most developed in the Kansai Region and the easternmost part of the Inland Sea. Japan&#x27;s rulers of the time even petitioned the Chinese court for confirmation of royal titles.
The Yamato polity, which emerged by the late 5th century, was distinguished by powerful great clans or extended families, including their dependants. Each clan was headed by a patriarch who performed sacred rites to the clan&#x27;s &quot;kami&quot; to ensure the long-term welfare of the clan. Clan members were the aristocracy, and the kingly line that controlled the Yamato court was at its pinnacle. The Kofun period of Japanese culture is also sometimes called the Yamato period by some Western scholars since this local chieftainship arose to become the Imperial dynasty at the end of the Kofun period.

==Asuka period==
The is generally defined as from 538 to 710. The arrival of Buddhism marked a change in Japanese society and affected the Yamato government.

The Yamato state evolved much during the Asuka period, which is named after the Asuka region, south of modern Nara, the site of numerous temporary imperial capitals established during the period. The Asuka period is known for its significant artistic, social, and political transformations, which had their origins in the late Kofun period.

Artistically, the term Tori Style is often used for the Asuka period. This is from the sculptor Kuratsukuri Tori, grandson of Chinese immigrant Shiba Tatto. Tori Style inherits Chinese Northern Wei style.

The arts during the Asuka and Nara periods are similar to contemporaneous art in China and Korea. One example of this is Tori Busshi&#x27;s Shaka Triad which reflects the style of early to mid-sixth-century Chinese style.

=== Introduction of Buddhism ===
According to , was officially introduced to the Yamato court through Baekje in 552, while it is widely recognized Buddhism was introduced in 538 based on the biography of Prince Shōtoku () and the record of Gangō-ji ().

Initial uptake of Buddhism was slow. records that when Emperor Kinmei discussed about the acceptance of this new foreign religion, Soga no Iname expressed his support while Mononobe no Okoshi and Nakatomi no Kamako (later the Fujiwara clan) opposed not on religious grounds, but more so as the results of feelings of nationalism and a degree of xenophobia.

With the dawn of the Asuka period, the use of elaborate kofun tombs by the imperial family and other elite fell out of use because of prevailing new Buddhist beliefs, which put greater emphasis on the transience of human life. Commoners and the elite in outlying regions, however, continued to use kofun until the late seventh century, and simpler but distinctive tombs continued in use throughout the following period.

Buddhism only started to spread after Mononobe no Moriya lost in the Battle of Shigisan in 587 where the Mononobe clan was defeated and crushed, and Empress Suiko openly encouraged the acceptance of Buddhism among all Japanese people. In 607, in order to obtain copies of Sutras, an imperial embassy was dispatched to Sui dynasty China.

== Yamato Imperial Court ==
The was named because there were many palace capitals in the southern part of the Yamato Plain in Nara during the Kofun period and the Asuka period. The Asuka period is known for its significant artistic, social, and political transformations, which had their origins in the late Kofun period.

The second half of the Kofun period, exercised power over clans in Kyushu and Honshu, bestowing titles, some hereditary, on clan chieftains. The Yamato name became synonymous with all of Japan as the Yamato rulers suppressed the clans and acquired agricultural lands. Based on Chinese models (including the adoption of the Chinese written language), they developed a central administration and an imperial court attended by subordinate clan chieftains but with no permanent capital. Asuka period mid-seventh century, the agricultural lands had grown to a substantial public domain, subject to the central policy. The basic administrative unit of the Gokishichido system was the county, and society was organized into occupation groups. Most people were farmers; others were fishers, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers, and ritual specialists.

<text>The XVIII Airborne Corps is a corps of the United States Army that has been in existence since 1942 and saw extensive service during World War II. The corps is designed for rapid deployment anywhere in the world and is referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s Contingency Corps.&quot; Its headquarters are at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

==History==
===Earlier formations known as XVIII Corps===

The modern XVIII Airborne Corps is not lineally related to two earlier U.S. Army formations known as the XVIII Corps. The first XVIII Corps was authorized by the National Defense Act of 1920 and constituted in the Regular Army on 29 July 1921. The headquarters and headquarters company were organized on 23 August 1922 with Organized Reserve personnel as &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) units at Dallas, Texas. The headquarters company was withdrawn from the Eighth Corps Area on 11 January 1927, allotted to the Seventh Corps Area, and organized on 3 August 1927 at Kansas City, Missouri, and relocated on 12 October 1931 to Sioux City, Iowa. The corps headquarters was withdrawn from the Regular Army on 1 October 1933 and demobilized, while the headquarters company remained allotted to the Regular Army.

The second iteration of the XVIII Corps was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 1 October 1933, allotted to the Eighth Corps Area, and assigned to the Third Army. The headquarters was concurrently initiated at San Antonio, Texas, with Reserve personnel previously assigned to the demobilized XVIII Corps (RAI). Concurrently, the headquarters company, XVIII Corps was withdrawn from the Seventh Corps Area and reallotted to the Eighth Corps Area, and reorganized on 25 February 1935 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The corps headquarters was redesignated on 1 January 1941 as Headquarters, XVIII Army Corps. The XVIII Corps was not activated prior to World War II and was located in San Antonio as of 7 December 1941 in an inactive reserve status. It was disbanded on 5 September 1945.

===World War II===
The present XVIII Airborne Corps was constituted in the Regular Army on 14 January 1942, five weeks after the entry of the United States into World War II, as the II Armored Corps, and was activated on 17 January 1942 at Camp Polk, Louisiana, under the command of Major General William Henry Harrison Morris, Jr. When the concept of armored corps proved unnecessary, II Armored Corps was re-designated as XVIII Corps on 9 October 1943 at the Presidio of Monterey, California.

XVIII Corps deployed to Europe on 17 August 1944 and became the XVIII Airborne Corps on 25 August 1944 at Ogbourne St. George, England, assuming command of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, as part of the preparation for Operation Market Garden. Prior to this time, the two divisions were assigned to VII Corps and jumped into Normandy during Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy, as part of VII Corps.

Major General Matthew Bunker Ridgway, a highly experienced airborne commander who had led the 82nd Airborne Division in Sicily, Italy and Normandy, was chosen to command the corps, which then consisted of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and was part of the newly created First Allied Airborne Army.

The corps headquarters did not see service in Operation Market Garden, with the British I Airborne Corps being chosen instead to exercise operational command of all Allied airborne forces in the operation, including the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions.

Following the Battle of the Bulge, in which the corps played a significant part (and which, during the early stages of the battle, the corps was commanded by Major General James M. Gavin of the 82nd Airborne), all American airborne units on the Western Front fell under command of the corps. XVIII Airborne Corps planned and executed Operation Varsity, the airborne component of Operation Plunder, the crossing of the River Rhine into Germany. It was one of the largest airborne operations of the war, with the British 6th and U.S. 17th Airborne Divisions under command.

After taking part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, the XVIII Airborne Corps, still under Ridgway, returned to the United States in June 1945 and was initially to take part in the invasion of Japan, codenamed Operation Downfall. However, the Japanese surrendered just weeks later and XVIII Airborne Corps was inactivated on 15 October 1945 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

=== Cold War ===
The Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg on 21 May 1951 under the command of Major General John W. Leonard. Since then, the corps has been the primary strategic response force, with subordinate units participating in over a dozen major operations (listed below) in both combat and humanitarian roles, primarily in Central America and the CENTCOM area of responsibility.

In 1958 the XVIII Airborne Corps was given the additional mission of becoming the Strategic Army Corps. The corps was now tasked, in addition, to provide a flexible strike capability that could deploy worldwide, on short notice, without a declaration of an emergency. The 4th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, and the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, were designated as STRAC&#x27;s first-line divisions, while the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas, and the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg were to provide backup in the event of general war. The 5th Logistical Command (later inactivated), also at Fort Bragg, would provide the corps with logistics support, while Fort Bragg&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery would control artillery units.

The Corps deployed forces to the United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (&#x27;Operation Power Pack&#x27;) in 1965.

The Corps deployed forces to the Vietnam War, including the entire 101st Airborne Division and the 3rd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne division.

In 1967 elements of the Corps were deployed to Detroit to suppress riots, and also to The Congo to support the government there and to rescue civilian hostages as part of Operation Dragon Rouge.

In 1982 the Corps first rotated elements to the Sinai Peninsula as part of the Multinational Force and Observers (UN) to guarantee the Camp David Peace Accords.
In 1983 elements of the Corps were deployed to the island of Grenada as part of Operation Urgent Fury, with the stated goal of reestablishing the democratically elected government.

In 1989 XVIII Airborne Corps, commanded by then LTG Carl Stiner, participated in the invasion of Panama in Operation Just Cause. Stiner served concurrently as Commander of Joint Task Force South.

=== Desert Storm ===
In 1991, XVIII Airborne Corps participated in the Persian Gulf War. The corps was responsible for securing VII Corps&#x27; northern flank against a possible Iraqi counterattack. Along with the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, 24th Infantry Division and 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, XVIII Airborne Corps also gained operational control of the French 6th Light Armor Division (LAD) (which also included units from the French Foreign Legion).

During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery consisted of the 3d Battalion, 8th Field Artillery; 5th Battalion, 8th Field Artillery; and the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 39th Field Artillery. The living quarters for these three units were situated between the 82d Airborne Division and the Special Forces at Fort Bragg. Of the three units, only 1-39th was airborne qualified and served as the only fully airborne deployable 155 mm Field Artillery unit in history. The 1-39th FA and 3-8th FA were key components of the thrust into Iraq in the first Gulf War, providing fire support for the French Foreign Legion and the 82nd Airborne Division.

The 5th Battalion, 8th Field Artillery also served in a major support role for 82d and French troops during the Gulf War. It consisted of three individual batteries. Batteries A and B were Airborne-qualified, while Battery C was air assault. Batteries A and B were assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Battery C was assigned to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. All of the battalions were subsequently re-flagged during the years following the Gulf War.

Task Force 118 had flown the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior off naval vessels during Operation Prime Chance in the 1980s, operating against Iran in the Persian Gulf. It was redesignated the 4th Squadron, 17th Cavalry on 15 January 1991. During the Gulf War of 1991 it was part of the 18th Aviation Brigade.

====Major formations, 1950–2006====
The 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions have served with the corps since the 1950s. The 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) was &#x27;reflagged&#x27; as the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) in April 1996.

* 7th Infantry Division (Light)
* 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry)
* XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery
** 18th Field Artillery Brigade
* 1st Sustainment Command (Theater)
* 35th Signal Brigade
* 18th Aviation Brigade (no longer active)
* 20th Engineer Brigade
* 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade
* 108th Air Defense Artillery Brigade
* 16th Military Police Brigade
* 44th Medical Command
* 163rd Ordnance
* &quot;additional smaller, National Guard, and Reserve units&quot;

===21st century===
The Corps headquarters was deployed to Afghanistan from May 2002 – 2003, and became Combined Joint Task Force 180 for the deployment.

XVIII Airborne Corps was deployed from January 2005 to January 2006 to Baghdad, Iraq, where it served as the Multi-National Corps – Iraq. Following its return, XVIII Airborne Corps and its subordinate units began the process of modernization and reorganization.

Under the previous Army Chief of Staff&#x27;s future restructure of the Army, the corps headquarters of the XVIII Airborne Corps will lose its airborne (specifically parachute) certification as a cost-cutting measure—the same will occur to the divisional headquarters of the 82nd Airborne Division. This plan is designed to follow the U.S. Army&#x27;s restructuring plan to go from being division-based to brigade-based. This will mean that the largest units that will be airborne – specifically parachute certified – will be at the brigade level. Even so, for traditional and historical reasons, the formation will continue to be called the XVIII Airborne Corps.

The divisions that fall under the XVIII Airborne Corps (as well as the other two corps in the Army) are in a period of transition, shifting from corps control to fall directly under FORSCOM, eliminating the corps status as a middle man. This ties in with the Army&#x27;s broad modularity plan, as a corps can deploy and support any unit, not just the units subordinate to the corps. The 3d Infantry Division, the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), and the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) have already changed over to direct FORSCOM control. The 82nd Airborne Division will transfer after the division returns from Afghanistan.

In August 2006, XVIII Airborne Corps traveled to South Korea to participate in Ulchi Focus Lens, a joint training exercise between the Republic of Korea Army and coalition forces stationed there.

In mid-April, 2007, the Department of the Army confirmed the next OIF deployment schedule, with XVIII Airborne Corps deploying to relieve III Corps as the MNC-I at Camp Victory, Baghdad, Iraq. XVIII Airborne Corps is scheduled to replace III Corps in November, 2007. The corps will deploy along with 1st Armored Division and 4th Infantry Division, as well as 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, and 1st BCT, 82nd Airborne Division.

On 21 December 2016, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; reported that in August the XVIII Airborne Corps deployed to Iraq for Operation Inherent Resolve, in December this included the XVIII Airborne Corps headquarters and the 1st Special Forces Command, which is deployed as the Special Operations Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve. The 18th Field Artillery Brigade deployed into Iraq with High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.

A Canadian Army General has served with the XVIII Corps since 2007.

XVIII Airborne Corps returned to Fort Bragg (which was then-named Fort Liberty), in October 2022 after a nine month deployment to Germany, in support of NATO and European Allies and partners. The mission was to provide a joint task force-capable headquarters in light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="248574" wikidata="Q907495" url="?curid=248574" title="Yamato Province">
<text>was a province of Japan, located in Kinai, corresponding to present-day Nara Prefecture in Honshū. It was also called . Yamato consists of two characters, 大 &quot;great&quot;, and 和 &quot;Wa&quot;. At first, the name was written with one different character (), but due to its offensive connotation, for about ten years after 737, this was revised to use more desirable characters () (see Names of Japan). The final revision was made in the second year of the Tenpyō-hōji era (). It is classified as a great province in the &quot;Engishiki&quot;.

The Yamato Period in the history of Japan refers to the late Kofun Period (c. 250–538) and Asuka Period (538–710). Japanese archaeologists and historians emphasize the fact that during the early Kofun Period the Yamato Kingship was in close contention with other regional powers, such as Kibi Province near present-day Okayama Prefecture. Around the 6th century, the local chieftainship gained national control and established the Imperial court in Yamato Province.

The battleship , the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet during World War II, was named after this province.

==Capital==
During the Kofun period (300 to 538) and the Asuka period, many palace capitals were located in Kashihara, Asuka, and Sakurai. Yamato was the first central government of the unified country in the Kofun period. Heijō-kyō capital was placed in Nara City during the Nara period.

In the 14th century, the capital of the Southern Court was established in Yoshino and Anou.

==Temples==
The provincial temple for monks is popularly thought to have been Tōdai-ji, but it may have in fact been a different one in Kashihara. The one for nuns was Hokke-ji.

The primary shinto shrine was Sakurai&#x27;s Ōmiwa Shrine, but there have been no records stating as such found at the shrine itself. There were no secondary shrines. The sōja (or principal Shinto shrine in the province) was Kokufu Shrine (Takatori, Takaichi, Nara).

<doc id="248580" wikidata="Q2433802" url="?curid=248580" title="List of British heritage and private railways">
<text>This is a list of heritage, private and preserved railways throughout the United Kingdom, the Crown dependencies, and British Overseas Territories whether operational or closed, that are operated for charitable purposes or shareholder profit. Some also provide economic local transport. For rail museums, see &quot;List of British railway museums&quot;.

Many of the standard-gauge railways listed, including former branch lines and ex-mainline routes, were closed by British Railways under the Beeching Axe of the 1960s. Most have been restored and operate as heritage lines. A smaller number of lines were formerly industrial or colliery railways.

Many of these preserved railways are mentioned in national and international tour guides, and visits may form part of a school curriculum or feature in other studies, including civil engineering, mechanics, social, economic and political history, visual arts and drama.

This list also includes tramways. Nearly all tram services in Britain ended in the 1950s and early 1960s, leaving just Blackpool Corporation Tramways, although some big cities have since revived them in the late 20th century onwards.

This list includes those railways which has public open days and excludes those on private sites which are not advertised to the public.

<doc id="248581" wikidata="Q204170" url="?curid=248581" title="Darkness">
<text>Darkness is the condition resulting from a lack of illumination, or an absence of visible light.

Human vision is unable to distinguish colors in conditions of very low luminance because the hue-sensitive photoreceptor cells on the retina are inactive when light levels are insufficient, in the range of visual perception referred to as scotopic vision.

The emotional response to darkness has generated metaphorical usages of the term in many cultures, often used to describe an unhappy or foreboding feeling.

&quot;Darkness&quot; may also refer to night, which occurs when the Sun is more than 18° below the horizon.

==Scientific==

===Perception===
The perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light that sometimes lead to afterimages. In perceiving, the eye is active, and the part of the retina that is unstimulated produces a complementary afterimage.

===Physics===

In terms of physics, an object is said to be dark when it absorbs photons, causing it to appear dim compared to other objects. For example, matte black paint does not reflect much visible light and appears dark, whereas white paint reflects much light and appears bright. For more information, see color. An object may appear dark, but it may be bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive.

A dark area has limited light sources, making things hard to see. Exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness. When a vertebrate, like a human, enters a dark area, its pupils dilate, allowing more light to enter the eye and improving night vision. Also, the light detecting cells in the human eye (rods and cones) will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness.

One scientific measure of darkness is the Bortle scale, which indicates the night sky&#x27;s and stars&#x27; brightness at a particular location, and the observability of celestial objects at that location.

The material known as Vantablack is one of the darkest substances known, absorbing up to 99.965% of visible light (at 663 nm if the light is perpendicular to the material), and was developed by Surrey NanoSystems in the United Kingdom. The name is a compound of the acronym VANTA (vertically aligned nanotube arrays) and the color black.

===Technical===
The color of a point, on a standard 24-bit computer display, is defined by three RGB (red, green, blue) values, each ranging from 0–255. When the red, green, and blue components of a pixel are fully illuminated (255,255,255), the pixel appears white; when all three components are unilluminated (0,0,0), the pixel appears black.

==Cultural==

===Artistic===


Artists use darkness to emphasize and contrast the presence of light. Darkness can be used as a counterpoint to areas of lightness to create leading lines and voids. Such shapes draw the eye around areas of the painting. Shadows add depth and perspective to a painting.

Color paints are mixed together to create darkness, because each color absorbs certain frequencies of light. Theoretically, mixing together the three primary colors, or the three secondary colors, will absorb all visible light and create black. In practice, it is difficult to prevent the mixture from taking on a brown tint.

===Literature===
As a poetic term in the Western world, darkness is used to connote the presence of shadows, evil, and foreboding, or in modern parlance, to connote that a story is grim, heavy, and/or depressing.

====Religion====
The concept of light and darkness holds profound symbolic and theological significance across various religious traditions, serving as metaphors for creation, morality, and the nature of existence.

In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the first creation narrative begins with a void, described as &quot;formless and empty,&quot; over which &quot;darkness was over the surface of the deep&quot; (Genesis 1:2). Into this void, God introduces light, declaring, &quot;Let there be light&quot; (Genesis 1:3), and separates this light from the darkness. This initial act of creation is distinct from the later creation of celestial bodies—the sun and moon—on the fourth day.

The symbolism of darkness and light in these traditions extends beyond the physical. Light is often associated with divine presence, knowledge, and goodness, while darkness symbolizes ignorance, separation from God, and sin. For example, in Exodus 10:21, darkness is described as &quot;the second-to-last plague&quot; inflicted upon Egypt, representing both physical and spiritual blindness. Similarly, in the New Testament, Jesus frequently contrasts light and darkness in his teachings. Darkness is the &quot;outer realm&quot; where there is &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth&quot; (Matthew 8:12), symbolizing eternal separation from God.

In Islam, light (&quot;nūr&quot;) and darkness (&quot;ẓulumāt&quot;) are frequently invoked in both physical and spiritual contexts, reflecting profound moral and theological truths. The Quran begins its account of creation with Allah (or God) making the heavens and the earth and then creating &quot;the darknesses and the light&quot; (Quran 6:1). However, unlike some traditions where darkness is portrayed as inherently evil or chaotic, Islam emphasizes that both are under Allah&#x27;s divine will and serve His purposes.

Light in the Quran often represents guidance, faith, and divine revelation, while darkness symbolizes misguidance, disbelief, and moral corruption. For instance, believers are often described as being &quot;brought out from darkness into light&quot; (Quran 2:257), a metaphor for their journey from ignorance to divine knowledge. This dichotomy underscores the moral framework of Islam, where both light and darkness are tools through which Allah tests and guides humanity.

In ancient Greek mythology, Erebus was a primordial deity representing the personification of darkness, particularly associated with the shadowy realm of death and the underworld. In Greek cosmology, darkness was often linked to the afterlife, where souls journeyed into the depths of the underworld, a place of shadow and obscurity.

Darkness in Greek cosmology was not merely an absence of light but a distinct and active force. The underworld, ruled by Hades, was a place of obscurity and shadow, reflecting the ambiguous fate of the human soul after death. In this tradition, darkness often signified the unknown and the eternal, as well as the boundaries between life and the afterlife.

====Philosophy====
In Chinese philosophy, yin is the complementary feminine part of the taijitu and is represented by a dark lobe.

====Poetry====
The use of darkness as a rhetorical device has a long-standing tradition. William Shakespeare, working in the 16th and 17th centuries, made a character called the &quot;prince of darkness&quot; (King Lear: III, iv) and gave darkness jaws with which to devour love. (A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream: I, i) Geoffrey Chaucer, a 14th-century Middle English writer of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, wrote that knights must cast away the &quot;workes of darkness&quot;. In &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante described hell as &quot;solid darkness stain&#x27;d&quot;.

====Language====
In Old English there were three words that could mean darkness: , and &quot;&quot;. &#x27; also meant &quot;hiding-place&quot; and became holster. &#x27; meant &quot;mist&quot; and fell out of use like many strong verbs. It is however still used in the Dutch saying &quot;&quot; which means secretly. &#x27; meant &quot;shadow&quot; and remained in use. The word &quot;dark&quot; eventually evolved from the word &#x27;.

<text>In mathematics, more specifically topology, a local homeomorphism is a function between topological spaces that, intuitively, preserves local (though not necessarily global) structure. 
If formula_1 is a local homeomorphism, formula_2 is said to be an étale space over formula_3 Local homeomorphisms are used in the study of sheaves. Typical examples of local homeomorphisms are covering maps.

A topological space formula_2 is locally homeomorphic to formula_5 if every point of formula_2 has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of formula_3 
For example, a manifold of dimension formula_8 is locally homeomorphic to formula_9

If there is a local homeomorphism from formula_2 to formula_11 then formula_2 is locally homeomorphic to formula_11 but the converse is not always true. 
For example, the two dimensional sphere, being a manifold, is locally homeomorphic to the plane formula_14 but there is no local homeomorphism formula_15

==Formal definition==

A function formula_1 between two topological spaces is called a if every point formula_17 has an open neighborhood formula_18 whose image formula_19 is open in formula_5 and the restriction formula_21 is a homeomorphism (where the respective subspace topologies are used on formula_18 and on formula_19).

==Examples and sufficient conditions==

Local homeomorphisms versus homeomorphisms

Every homeomorphism is a local homeomorphism. But a local homeomorphism is a homeomorphism if and only if it is bijective. 
A local homeomorphism need not be a homeomorphism. For example, the function formula_24 defined by formula_25 (so that geometrically, this map wraps the real line around the circle) is a local homeomorphism but not a homeomorphism. 
The map formula_26 defined by formula_27 which wraps the circle around itself formula_8 times (that is, has winding number formula_8), is a local homeomorphism for all non-zero formula_30 but it is a homeomorphism only when it is bijective (that is, only when formula_31 or formula_32). 

Generalizing the previous two examples, every covering map is a local homeomorphism; in particular, the universal cover formula_33 of a space formula_5 is a local homeomorphism. 
In certain situations the converse is true. For example: if formula_35 is a proper local homeomorphism between two Hausdorff spaces and if formula_5 is also locally compact, then formula_37 is a covering map. 

Local homeomorphisms and composition of functions

The composition of two local homeomorphisms is a local homeomorphism; explicitly, if formula_1 and formula_39 are local homeomorphisms then the composition formula_40 is also a local homeomorphism. 
The restriction of a local homeomorphism to any open subset of the domain will again be a local homomorphism; explicitly, if formula_1 is a local homeomorphism then its restriction formula_42 to any formula_18 open subset of formula_2 is also a local homeomorphism. 

If formula_1 is continuous while both formula_39 and formula_40 are local homeomorphisms, then formula_48 is also a local homeomorphism.

Inclusion maps

If formula_49 is any subspace (where as usual, formula_18 is equipped with the subspace topology induced by formula_2) then the inclusion map formula_52 is always a topological embedding. But it is a local homeomorphism if and only if formula_18 is open in formula_54 The subset formula_18 being open in formula_2 is essential for the inclusion map to be a local homeomorphism because the inclusion map of a non-open subset of formula_2 yields a local homeomorphism (since it will not be an open map). 

The restriction formula_42 of a function formula_1 to a subset formula_49 is equal to its composition with the inclusion map formula_61 explicitly, formula_62
Since the composition of two local homeomorphisms is a local homeomorphism, if formula_1 and formula_52 are local homomorphisms then so is formula_62 Thus restrictions of local homeomorphisms to open subsets are local homeomorphisms.

Invariance of domain

Invariance of domain guarantees that if formula_66 is a continuous injective map from an open subset formula_18 of formula_68 then formula_19 is open in formula_70 and formula_71 is a homeomorphism. 
Consequently, a continuous map formula_66 from an open subset formula_73 will be a local homeomorphism if and only if it is a &quot;locally&quot; injective map (meaning that every point in formula_18 has a neighborhood formula_75 such that the restriction of formula_48 to formula_75 is injective). 

Local homeomorphisms in analysis

It is shown in complex analysis that a complex analytic function formula_78 (where formula_18 is an open subset of the complex plane formula_80) is a local homeomorphism precisely when the derivative formula_81 is non-zero for all formula_82 
The function formula_83 on an open disk around formula_84 is not a local homeomorphism at formula_84 when formula_86 
In that case formula_84 is a point of &quot;ramification&quot; (intuitively, formula_8 sheets come together there). 

Using the inverse function theorem one can show that a continuously differentiable function formula_66 (where formula_18 is an open subset of formula_70) is a local homeomorphism if the derivative formula_92 is an invertible linear map (invertible square matrix) for every formula_93 
(The converse is false, as shown by the local homeomorphism formula_94 with formula_95). 
An analogous condition can be formulated for maps between differentiable manifolds. 

Local homeomorphisms and fibers

Suppose formula_1 is a continuous open surjection between two Hausdorff second-countable spaces where formula_2 is a Baire space and formula_5 is a normal space. If every fiber of formula_48 is a discrete subspace of formula_2 (which is a necessary condition for formula_1 to be a local homeomorphism) then formula_48 is a formula_5-valued local homeomorphism on a dense open subset of formula_54 
To clarify this statement&#x27;s conclusion, let formula_105 be the (unique) largest open subset of formula_2 such that formula_107 is a local homeomorphism. 
If every fiber of formula_48 is a discrete subspace of formula_2 then this open set formula_110 is necessarily a subset of formula_54 
In particular, if formula_112 then formula_113 a conclusion that may be false without the assumption that formula_48&#x27;s fibers are discrete (see this footnote for an example). 
One corollary is that every continuous open surjection formula_48 between completely metrizable second-countable spaces that has discrete fibers is &quot;almost everywhere&quot; a local homeomorphism (in the topological sense that formula_116 is a dense open subset of its domain). 
For example, the map formula_117 defined by the polynomial formula_118 is a continuous open surjection with discrete fibers so this result guarantees that the maximal open subset formula_116 is dense in formula_120 with additional effort (using the inverse function theorem for instance), it can be shown that formula_121 which confirms that this set is indeed dense in formula_122 This example also shows that it is possible for formula_116 to be a dense subset of formula_48&#x27;s domain. 
Because every fiber of every non-constant polynomial is finite (and thus a discrete, and even compact, subspace), this example generalizes to such polynomials whenever the mapping induced by it is an open map.

Local homeomorphisms and Hausdorffness

There exist local homeomorphisms formula_1 where formula_5 is a Hausdorff space but formula_2 is not. 
Consider for instance the quotient space formula_128 where the equivalence relation formula_129 on the disjoint union of two copies of the reals identifies every negative real of the first copy with the corresponding negative real of the second copy. 
The two copies of formula_84 are not identified and they do not have any disjoint neighborhoods, so formula_2 is not Hausdorff. One readily checks that the natural map formula_132 is a local homeomorphism. 
The fiber formula_133 has two elements if formula_134 and one element if formula_135 
Similarly, it is possible to construct a local homeomorphisms formula_1 where formula_2 is Hausdorff and formula_5 is not: pick the natural map from formula_139 to formula_140 with the same equivalence relation formula_129 as above.

==Properties==

A map is a local homeomorphism if and only if it is continuous, open, and locally injective. In particular, every local homeomorphism is a continuous and open map. A bijective local homeomorphism is therefore a homeomorphism. 

Whether or not a function formula_1 is a local homeomorphism depends on its codomain. The image formula_143 of a local homeomorphism formula_1 is necessarily an open subset of its codomain formula_5 and formula_146 will also be a local homeomorphism (that is, formula_48 will continue to be a local homeomorphism when it is considered as the surjective map formula_146 onto its image, where formula_143 has the subspace topology inherited from formula_5). However, in general it is possible for formula_146 to be a local homeomorphism but formula_1 to be a local homeomorphism (as is the case with the map formula_153 defined by formula_154 for example). A map formula_1 is a local homomorphism if and only if formula_146 is a local homeomorphism and formula_143 is an open subset of formula_3 

Every fiber of a local homeomorphism formula_1 is a discrete subspace of its domain formula_54

A local homeomorphism formula_1 transfers &quot;local&quot; topological properties in both directions: 
* formula_2 is locally connected if and only if formula_143 is;
* formula_2 is locally path-connected if and only if formula_143 is;
* formula_2 is locally compact if and only if formula_143 is;
* formula_2 is first-countable if and only if formula_143 is.

As pointed out above, the Hausdorff property is not local in this sense and need not be preserved by local homeomorphisms.

The local homeomorphisms with codomain formula_5 stand in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the sheaves of sets on formula_171 this correspondence is in fact an equivalence of categories. Furthermore, every continuous map with codomain formula_5 gives rise to a uniquely defined local homeomorphism with codomain formula_5 in a natural way. All of this is explained in detail in the article on sheaves.

==Generalizations and analogous concepts==

The idea of a local homeomorphism can be formulated in geometric settings different from that of topological spaces. 
For differentiable manifolds, we obtain the local diffeomorphisms; for schemes, we have the formally étale morphisms and the étale morphisms; and for toposes, we get the étale geometric morphisms.

<text>Donald Curry (born September 7, 1961), is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1980 to 1991, and in 1997. He held the WBA world welterweight title from 1983 to 1986, the undisputed world welterweight title from 1985 to 1986 and the WBC light middleweight title from 1988 to 1989, and challenged once for the IBF middleweight title in 1990. In 2019, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Amateur career==
Curry&#x27;s amateur record is usually listed as 400–4, but it is sometimes listed as 396–4 and 400–6. Curry thinks he might have had more than 404 bouts, but he is sure he had only four losses. Curry was originally trained by Wesley Gale Parker out of Fort Worth, Texas. Parker also trained his brother Super Lightweight champion Bruce Curry.

==Professional career==

===Early years===
Curry, at age 19, won his professional debut with a first-round knocked of Mario Tineo on December 26, 1980. &quot;I didn&#x27;t start thinking about turning pro until I was about 18,&quot; Curry said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the pro game. I couldn&#x27;t have told you the names of more than two world champions, and they were Ray Leonard and Muhammad Ali.&quot;

With a record of 11–0, Curry knocked out former world title challenger Bruce Finch in three rounds to win the NABF welterweight title on May 5, 1982.

Curry fought future WBA/WBC welterweight champion Marlon Starling for the USBA welterweight championship on October 24, 1982. Curry bruised his ribs during training and also had a lot of trouble making weight. He reportedly was nine pounds over the 147-pound welterweight limit less than a week before the fight. Despite these problems, Curry won by a twelve-round split decision to unify the USBA and NABF welterweight titles and hand Starling his first pro loss. The win earned Curry the unified #2 spot in the rankings behind Milton McCrory for the welterweight title.

===Undisputed welterweight champion===
On February 13, 1983, Curry fought Jun-Suk Hwang for the WBA welterweight championship, which had become vacant after the retirement of Sugar Ray Leonard. Curry suffered a flash knockdown in the seventh round but otherwise dominated the fight and won by a lopsided fifteen-round unanimous decision. Three months later, Curry&#x27;s older brother, Bruce, won the WBC light welterweight title. They were the first pair of brothers to hold world titles simultaneously.

After making his first title defense, a first-round knockout of Roger Stafford, Curry had a rematch with Starling. Curry, mixing up punches to the body and head, stayed on top of Starling and pounded out a fifteen-round unanimous decision to retain the titles of the WBA and the newly formed IBF, which elected to recognize Curry as their champion before the fight.

Curry&#x27;s next three fights were successful title defenses. He stopped Elio Diaz in eight rounds, Nino LaRocca in six, and Colin Jones in four. His next two fights were non-title fights at junior middleweight. He stopped James &quot;Hard Rock&quot; Green in two and Pablo Baez in six.

On December 6, 1985, Curry fought Milton McCrory, the undefeated WBC welterweight champion, to unify the welterweight titles. In the second round, Curry slipped a McCrory left jab and countered with a left hook to the chin that sent McCrory down. McCrory struggled to rise. When he did, Curry dropped him again with a solid right cross. Referee Mills Lane counted him out. Curry became the first undisputed welterweight champion since Sugar Ray Leonard retired in 1982.
Curry&#x27;s first defense of the undisputed championship was in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas. His opponent was Eduardo Rodriguez, whom he knocked out in the second round with a left-right combination to the head. Curry was 25–0 with 20 knockouts, and many boxing experts considered him to be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.

===Major upset===
Curry&#x27;s next defense of the title was against Lloyd Honeyghan of the United Kingdom on September 27, 1986, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Honeyghan was 27–0 and ranked #1 by the WBC.

Curry&#x27;s training was disrupted by managerial issues. His managerial contract with David Gorman was to expire on September 30, 1986, and Curry announced that Akbar Muhammad would become his new manager. Muhammad said he wanted Gorman to remain a part of Curry&#x27;s team, but Gorman said he wouldn&#x27;t accept a position as co-manager and would not let Curry work out of his gym if he was not Curry&#x27;s manager. Curry told Gorman to stay away from his training camp, but shortly before the fight, Curry asked him to work in his corner for the fight and Gorman agreed.

Oddsmakers considered Curry vs. Honeyghan to be such a mismatch that some would not offer a betting line. However, Honeyghan came into the fight with great confidence and bet $5,000 on himself at 5-1 odds. &quot;I want people to know how much I believe in myself,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to start punching Curry on the head. I&#x27;m going to smash his face in.&quot;

Honeyghan easily won the opening two rounds, pressuring Curry and rocking him badly in the second round. Curry came back to win the next two rounds, but he had little left after that. He was drained from struggling to make weight, having to lose 11 pounds three days before the fight. &quot;I was weak and sluggish. I had no strength in my legs, and my timing just wasn&#x27;t there. I wasn&#x27;t myself,&quot; Curry said after the fight. &quot;I won&#x27;t fight as a welterweight again.&quot;

Akbar Muhammad said Curry weighed 168 pounds six and a half weeks prior to the fight, before he went to New Orleans to train. Then his grandfather&#x27;s death caused the fighter to lose concentration. &quot;His weight went up to 157, 158. He told me, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think I can make the weight.&#x27; He wanted to pull out of the fight,&quot; Muhammad said. &quot;I told him he was a professional and had an obligation to meet.&quot;

Honeyghan manhandled Curry in rounds five and six. Late in the sixth, an accidental headbutt opened a bad cut over Curry&#x27;s left eye. Returning to his corner after the sixth, with blood flowing down his face, Curry shook his head and was heard to tell his corner, &quot;I&#x27;m through.&quot; Ringside physicians Frank Doggett and Paul Williams examined the cut after the sixth round and told referee Octavio Meyran to stop the fight, giving Honeyghan a TKO victory. &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named the fight Upset of the Year.

===Move up in weight===
After losing to Honeyghan, Curry moved up to the light middleweight division.

Curry defeated Tony Montgomery to win the USBA light middleweight title on February 7, 1987. Montgomery was disqualified in the fifth round for intentional headbutts. Curry&#x27;s next opponent, former IBF light middleweight champion Carlos Santos, was also disqualified in the fifth round for intentional headbutts.

On April 6, 1987, the day Sugar Ray Leonard defeated Marvelous Marvin Hagler for the world middleweight championship and two days after defeating Santos, Curry filed a million dollar lawsuit against Leonard and his attorney, Mike Trainer. The suit stated that Leonard and Trainer took &quot;undue and unconscionable advantage of Curry&quot; through fraud, conspiracy and breach of financial responsibilities, and they &quot;conspired to prevent Curry from entering the middleweight divisions to assure Leonard&#x27;s unobstructed opportunity to fight the middleweight champion.&quot;

Curry said he asked Leonard and Trainer for advice concerning his future, and they advised him to stay at welterweight and not to move up in weight to fight WBA light middleweight champion Mike McCallum or middleweight champion Hagler. Curry was going to face McCallum on June 23, 1986, but he decided to back out and stay at welterweight. Several weeks later, Leonard announced that he was coming out of retirement to fight Hagler.

====McCallum vs Curry====
Curry fought Mike McCallum on July 18, 1987, for the WBA light middleweight championship. The fight was televised live on HBO. Curry tried to have Sugar Ray Leonard, who worked for HBO as a commentator, removed from the broadcast team, but HBO decided to include Leonard as part of the telecast.

McCallum, 31–0 with 28 knockouts, was boxing&#x27;s longest reigning champion. Curry, a 2–1 betting favorite, boxed well and was leading on all three scorecards after four rounds. In the fifth, McCallum caught Curry on the chin with a left hook, putting down for the count. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what he hit me with,&quot; Curry said forty minutes after the fight. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what happened.&quot;

HBO commentator Barry Tompkins told his broadcasting partner Sugar Ray Leonard, &quot;You settled a case out of court here.&quot;

===WBC light middleweight champion===
After outpointing former WBC champion Lupe Aquino, Curry got another title shot. He traveled to Italy to fight Gianfranco Rosi for the WBC light middleweight title on July 8, 1988. Curry put him down five times, and Rosi retired on his stool after the ninth round. &quot;I trained hard for five months to win this title and it paid off,&quot; Curry said.

Curry was once again a champion, but his reign didn&#x27;t last very long. He lost the title in his first defense, dropping a twelve-round unanimous decision to the lightly regarded Rene Jacquot on February 11, 1989, in France. Curry built an early lead, but Jacquot came on in the second half of the fight. &quot;I just got tired,&quot; Curry said afterward. &quot;I thought I was in the best condition of my life but in the seventh, eighth and ninth rounds my legs just went.&quot; The fight that was named &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine Upset of the Year.

===Back-to-back title shots===
Following two knockout victories, Curry went back to France to fight Lineal/IBF middleweight champion Michael Nunn on October 18, 1990. Although Curry found the target, he didn&#x27;t have the power to hurt the bigger champion. Nunn dropped Curry with a flurry of unanswered punches in round ten, and the referee stopped the fight. 
In his next fight, Curry returned to light middleweight to fight Terry Norris for the WBC title. The fight took place June 1, 1991, in Palm Springs, California. It was a rough and competitive fight for seven rounds. In the eighth, Norris put Curry down for the count with a series of right hands. Norris then hit Curry with an illegal shot whilst Curry was on his knees. Curry later retired after the fight.

===Legal troubles===
In April 1994, Curry, along with Darrell Chambers and William &quot;Stanley&quot; Longstreet, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Detroit on drug conspiracy charges. The ten-count indictment charged them with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, money laundering and being part of a continuing criminal enterprise. &quot;My God, I don&#x27;t know anything about this,&quot; Curry said. &quot;I&#x27;m guilty by association. I&#x27;ve never, never ever had anything to do with drugs. I knew Stanley Longstreet and Darrell Chambers as boxers. I know nothing about any drug ring. I&#x27;m stunned.&quot;

In January 1995, Curry was acquitted on all charges, Chambers was found guilty and Longstreet took a plea deal. &quot;I have been systematically...lynched and then castrated by, first, the news media, and then by the criminal justice system,&quot; Curry said afterward. He also said paying for his legal defense destroyed him financially.

In March 1996, Curry was jailed for failing to pay child support. He won work release soon afterward, but that was revoked after he again failed to make support payments. He served six weeks of a six-month sentence.

===Return to boxing===
In need of money, Curry returned to boxing. &quot;This comeback is about a lot of things, but the bottom line is money,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t do this if I didn&#x27;t need the money.&quot; Curry&#x27;s first comeback fight was in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada on February 20, 1997. He knocked out Gary Jones in four rounds.

Curry&#x27;s next fight was against Emmett Linton, who was one of the boxers Curry trained after he retired from boxing. The Linton fight wasn&#x27;t just about money: It was personal.

Curry had been Linton&#x27;s manager and trainer. The two had a falling out in 1993. Linton said he didn&#x27;t like the way Curry was handling his career. Their feud really erupted when Curry accused Linton of giving information to the mother of one of his children about his finances, which Linton denied. The two got into a fight and guns were drawn but not used. Curry filed charges, but they were later dropped. Shortly afterward, Curry went to jail for failure to pay child support.

When Curry started his comeback, he asked promoter Bob Arum to get him a fight with Linton. Knowing that a good feud can sell a fight, Arum made the match. The fight took place at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, Nevada, on April 9, 1997.

Curry was no match for Linton. He was dropped in the first round and took a beating over the next six. Referee Richard Steele stopped the fight in the seventh round. &quot;I just didn&#x27;t have it,&quot; Curry said. &quot;I&#x27;m finished. I&#x27;ll never box again.&quot;

After the loss, Curry went to Valley Hospital in Las Vegas and learned that he had fought Linton with acute pancreatitis. &quot;That condition pre-existed the fight,&quot; said Phil Hamilton, Curry&#x27;s manager. &quot;We&#x27;re thinking maybe that explains why Donald felt so weak during the fight, and why maybe he deserves the chance to fight again.&quot;

Curry went back to the gym when he was well. &quot;I hope to give a better account of myself,&quot; he said, referring to the Linton fight. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t in shape and wasn&#x27;t who I thought I was that night.&quot; However, Curry never did fight again. He retired with a record of 34–6 with 25 knockouts.

==Post-career==
In November 2021, Curry&#x27;s sons revealed that they believed him to suffer from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, due to memory loss and other mental health issues. Following their appeal on Twitter, the World Boxing Council offered to schedule a brain scan for Curry.

<doc id="248589" wikidata="Q581259" url="?curid=248589" title="Socialist Party USA">
<text>The Socialist Party of the United States of America (also Socialist Party USA or SPUSA) is a socialist political party in the United States. SPUSA formed in 1973, one year after the Socialist Party of America splintered into three: Social Democrats, USA (legal successor); the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (split); and SPUSA.

SPUSA describes itself as a multi-tendency socialist party which hopes to win socialism through a &quot;democratic revolution from below&quot;. In contrast to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), SPUSA advocates for &quot;uncompromising independence&quot; from the Democratic Party. SPUSA describes socialism as &quot;radical democracy&quot;, in opposition to &quot;capitalist and authoritarian statist systems&quot;.

Notable members include David McReynolds, Frank Zeidler, and Dan La Botz. Former members include Ben Burgis.

== Organization ==

SPUSA is headquartered at the A. J. Muste Institute. , the Socialist Party had 11 local and state parties. Active SPUSA state parties include Michigan, New Jersey, Wisconsin. Inactive state parties include California, Maine, Kansas.

=== Membership ===
In 1975, chairman Frank Zeidler claimed that SPUSA had around 500 members nationwide. SPUSA saw growth during the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s, expanding from around 600 members to around 1,700 members. In 2008, WMNF claimed that SPUSA had around 3,000 members. However, in 2010, &quot;CommonDreams&quot; wrote that SPUSA had only 1,000 members, and party members described that as an increase in membership. In May 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that SPUSA had &quot;about 1,000 members nationally&quot;. In February 2012, &quot;The Root&quot; stated that SPUSA had &quot;around 1,500&quot; members.

== History ==

=== Background ===

In 1958, the Independent Socialist League, led by Max Shachtman, dissolved and joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA), which was founded by Eugene V. Debs. Shachtman had written that Soviet communism was a new form of class society, bureaucratic collectivism, in which the ruling class exploited and oppressed the population, and therefore he opposed the spread of communism. Shachtman argued that democratic socialists should work with labor unions and civil rights organizations to build a social democratic &quot;realignment&quot; of the Democratic Party. &quot;Shachmanites&quot; had a great amount of influence on the SPA.

In its 1972 convention, the SPA changed its name to Social Democrats, USA by a vote of 73 to 34, supported by both Co-Chairmen, Bayard Rustin and Charles S. Zimmerman. This rename was meant to be &quot;realistic&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored Darlington Hoopes as its candidate for president in the 1956 election, who received only 2,121 votes, in just six states. The majority report noted that the name &quot;party&quot; was &quot;misleading&quot; because the SPA no longer sponsored presidential candidates, and also hindered recruitment of activists who participated in the Democratic Party. The name &quot;Socialist&quot; was replaced by &quot;Social Democrats&quot; because many American associated the word &quot;socialism&quot; with Soviet communism. The party also wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties.

The convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, 8 seats for Harrington&#x27;s Coalition Caucus, 2 for the Debs caucus, and one for the &quot;independent&quot; Samuel  H. Friedman. These minority caucuses all opposed the name change. The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote, with the majority caucus winning every vote.

=== Founding ===
After their defeat at the convention, members of the two minority caucuses helped to found new socialist organizations. Harrington&#x27;s Coalition Caucus created the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee. 

The Debs Caucus, led by David McReynolds, formed the Union for Democratic Socialism. On May 30, 1973, the UDS incorporated the Socialist Party of the United States of America. Many activists from the local and state branches of the old Socialist Party of America, including the party&#x27;s Wisconsin, California, Illinois, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. organizations, participated in the reconstitution of SPUSA.

After its founding, the party promoted itself as the legitimate heir of the Socialist Party of America. SPUSA elected Frank Zeidler, former Mayor of Milwaukee, as its first national chairperson. Later, SPUSA nominated Zeidler for President. Zeidler believed the party would be able to collaborate with other socialist parties nationwide to spread the message of socialism.

=== Subsequent history ===
In 2008, SPUSA candidate for President Brian Moore vocally opposed the idea that Barack Obama was a socialist of any kind, saying it was &quot;misleading of the Republicans&quot; to spread that message.

In 2009, the Socialist Party of Connecticut protested in Hartford against Obama&#x27;s troop surge in Afghanistan.

In 2010, SPUSA Co-Chair Billy Wharton called Obama&#x27;s 2010 State of the Union Address a &quot;public relations ploy&quot;. Wharton criticized the Affordable Care Act as designed &quot;to protect the profit margins of private insurance companies&quot;.

== Ideology ==
SPUSA argues that socialism can only come through social revolution. SPUSA tendencies include both democratic socialism, for a gradual transformation of society, and revolutionary socialism, for a rapid transformation following a slow &quot;socialist transformation from below&quot; through radically democratic &quot;people&#x27;s organizations&quot;. SPUSA describes socialism as a radically democratic system which &quot;places people&#x27;s lives under their own control—a classless, feminist, socialist society free of racism, sexism, homophobia or transphobia,&quot; and in which &quot;the people own and control the means of production and distribution through democratically controlled public agencies, cooperatives, or other collective groups&quot;; &quot;full employment is realized for everyone who wants to work&quot;; &quot;workers have the right to form unions freely, and to strike and engage in other forms of job actions&quot;; and &quot;production of society is used for the benefit of all humanity, not for the private profit of a few.&quot;

Socialist Party candidates support expanding social spending and social ownership of capital. In 2009, Greg Pason&#x27;s proposals included socializing the United States health care system, a steeply graduated income tax, universal rent control and the elimination of all educational debts and tuition fees. In 1997, Pason called auto insurance &quot;a regressive tax against working people&quot;. Moore was also vocal of his support for socialized medicine. Moore supported economic democracy through social ownership and workers&#x27; control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions.

== Election results ==
SPUSA has fielded electoral candidates for local, state, and federal offices. SPUSA candidates usually run on a SPUSA ballot line, as independent, or as Green Party candidates.

SPUSA has often endorsed members of the Vermont Progressive Party (VPP), such as Peter Diamondstone. Most of these individuals were members of the Vermont socialist Liberty Union Party, but not members of SPUSA. These endorsees-but-not-members of SPUSA are not included below.

SPUSA has won several local offices, but never a state legislature, statewide, or federal office.

=== Current elected members ===
* Pat Noble, member of the Red Bank Regional High School Board of Education
* Samantha Pree-Stinson, member of the Minneapolis Board of Estimate and Taxation

=== Presidential elections ===

In the 1984 presidential election, SPUSA nominated the Citizens Party candidate for president, Sonia Johnson.

In the 2020 presidential election, the SPUSA nominated the Green Party nominee Howie Hawkins for president. Hawkins also received various state-level party endorsements, such as the Liberty Union Party in Vermont, in a bid to unite the &quot;non-sectarian independent Left&quot; behind a single campaign.

<doc id="248590" wikidata="Q50265477" url="?curid=248590" title="Luteinizing hormone">
<text>Luteinizing hormone (LH, also known as luteinising hormone, lutropin and sometimes lutrophin) is a hormone produced by gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The production of LH is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. In females, an acute rise of LH known as an LH surge, triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cell–stimulating hormone (ICSH), it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. It acts synergistically with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

== Etymology ==
The term luteinizing comes from the Latin &quot;luteus&quot;, meaning &quot;yellow&quot;. This is in reference to the corpus luteum, which is a mass of cells that forms in an ovary after an ovum (egg) has been discharged. The corpus luteum is so named because it often has a distinctive yellow color. The process of forming the corpus luteum is known as &quot;luteinization&quot;, and thus the hormone that triggers this process is termed the &quot;luteinizing&quot; hormone.

== Structure ==

LH is a heterodimeric glycoprotein. Each monomeric unit is a glycoprotein molecule; one alpha and one beta subunit make the full, functional protein.

Its structure is similar to that of the other glycoprotein hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The protein dimer contains 2 glycopeptidic subunits (labeled alpha- and beta- subunits) that are non-covalently associated:
* The &quot;alpha subunits&quot; of LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are identical, and contain 92 amino acids in human but 96 amino acids in almost all other vertebrate species (glycoprotein hormones do not exist in invertebrates).
* The &quot;beta subunits&quot; vary. LH has a beta subunit of 120 amino acids (LHB) that confers its specific biologic action and is responsible for the specificity of the interaction with the LH receptor. This beta subunit contains an amino acid sequence that exhibits large homologies with that of the beta subunit of hCG and both stimulate the same receptor. However, the hCG beta subunit contains an additional 24 amino acids, and the two hormones differ in the composition of their sugar moieties.

The different composition of these oligosaccharides affects bioactivity and speed of degradation. The biologic half-life of LH is 20 minutes, shorter than that of FSH (3–4 hours) and hCG (24 hours). The biological half-life of LH is 23 hours subcutaneous or terminal half life of 10-12 hours.

== Genes ==
The gene for the &quot;alpha subunit&quot; is located on chromosome 6q12.21.

The luteinizing hormone &quot;beta subunit&quot; gene is localized in the LHB/CGB gene cluster on chromosome 19q13.32. In contrast to the alpha gene activity, beta LH subunit gene activity is restricted to the pituitary gonadotropic cells. It is regulated by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. GnRH activates Egr1 which interacts with transcription factors NR5A1 and PITX1 at the gene promoter to up-regulate LHB transcription.

== Function ==
In both males and females, LH works upon endocrine cells in the gonads to produce androgens. 

===Effects in females===

LH supports theca cells in the ovaries that provide androgens and hormonal precursors for estradiol production. At the time of menstruation, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. With the rise in estrogens, LH receptors are also expressed on the maturing follicle, which causes it to produce more estradiol. Eventually, when the follicle has fully matured, a spike in 17α-hydroxyprogesterone production by the follicle inhibits the production of estrogens. Previously, the preovulatory LH surge was attributed to a decrease in estrogen-mediated negative feedback of GnRH in the hypothalamus, subsequently stimulating the release of LH from the anterior pituitary. Some studies, however, attribute the LH surge to positive feedback from estradiol after production by the dominant follicle exceeds a certain threshold. Exceptionally high levels of estradiol induce hypothalamic production of progesterone, which stimulates elevated GnRH secretion, triggering a surge in LH. The increase in LH production only lasts for 24 to 48 hours. This &quot;LH surge&quot; triggers ovulation, thereby not only releasing the egg from the follicle, but also initiating the conversion of the residual follicle into a corpus luteum that, in turn, produces progesterone to prepare the endometrium for a possible implantation. LH is necessary to maintain luteal function for the second two weeks of the menstrual cycle. If pregnancy occurs, LH levels will decrease, and luteal function will instead be maintained by the action of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), a hormone very similar to LH but secreted from the new placenta.

Gonadal steroids (estrogens and androgens) generally have negative feedback effects on GnRH-1 release at the level of the hypothalamus and at the gonadotropes, reducing their sensitivity to GnRH. Positive feedback by estrogens also occurs in the gonadal axis of female mammals and is responsible for the midcycle surge of LH that stimulates ovulation. Although estrogens inhibit kisspeptin (Kp) release from kiss1 neurons in the ARC, estrogens stimulate Kp release from the Kp neurons in the AVPV. As estrogens&#x27; levels gradually increase the positive effect predominates, leading to the LH surge. GABA-secreting neurons that innervate GnRH-1 neurons also can stimulate GnRH-1 release. These GABA neurons also possess ERs and may be responsible for the GnRH-1 surge. Part of the inhibitory action of endorphins on GnRH-1 release is through inhibition of these GABA neurons. Rupture of the ovarian follicle at ovulation causes a drastic reduction in estrogen synthesis and a marked increase in secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum in the ovary, reinstating a predominantly negative feedback on hypothalamic secretion of GnRH-1.

===Effects in males===
LH acts upon the Leydig cells of the testis and is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The Leydig cells produce testosterone under the control of LH. LH binds to LH receptors on the membrane surface of Leydig cells. Binding to this receptor causes an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a secondary messenger, which allows cholesterol to translocate into the mitochondria. Within the mitochondria, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by CYP11A1. Pregnenolone is then converted to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). DHEA is then converted to androstenedione by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and then finally converted to testosterone by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B). The onset of puberty is controlled by two major hormones: FSH initiates spermatogenesis and LH signals the release of testosterone, an androgen that exerts both endocrine activity and intratesticular activity on spermatogenesis.

LH is released from the pituitary gland, and is controlled by pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. When bloodstream testosterone levels are low, the pituitary gland is stimulated to release LH. As the levels of testosterone increase, it will act on the pituitary through a negative feedback loop and inhibit the release of GnRH and LH consequently. Androgens (including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the pineal gland, leading to increased melatonin and reduced LH and FSH by melatonin-induced increase of Gonadotropin-Inhibitory Hormone (GnIH) synthesis and secretion. Testosterone can also be aromatized into estradiol (E2) to inhibit LH. E2 decreases pulse amplitude and responsiveness to GnRH from the hypothalamus onto the pituitary.

Changes in LH and testosterone blood levels and pulse secretions are induced by changes in sexual arousal in human males.

=== Effects in the brain ===
Luteinizing hormone receptors are located in areas of the brain associated with cognitive function. The role of LH role in the central nervous system (CNS) may be of relevance to understanding and treating post-menopausal cognitive decline.

Some research has observed an inverse relationship between circulating LH and CNS LH levels. After ovariectomy (a procedure used to mimic menopause) in female mice, circulating LH levels surge while CNS levels of LH fall. Treatments that lower circulating LH restore LH levels in the CNS.

== Normal levels ==

LH levels are normally low during childhood and in women, high after menopause. Since LH is secreted as pulses, it is necessary to follow its concentration over a sufficient period of time to get proper information about its blood level.

During reproductive years, typical levels are between 1 and 20 IU/L. Physiologic high LH levels are seen during the LH surge (v.s.) and typically last 48 hours.

In males over 18 years of age, reference ranges have been estimated to be 1.8–8.6 IU/L.

LH is measured in international units (IU). When quantifying the amount of LH in a sample in IUs, it is important to know which international standard your lot of LH was calibrated against since they can vary broadly from year to year. For human urinary LH, one IU is defined as 1/189th of an ampule denoted 96/602 and distributed by the NIBSC, corresponding to approximately 0.04656 μg of LH protein for a single IU, but older standard versions are still widely in use.

== Predicting ovulation ==

The detection of a surge in release of luteinizing hormone indicates impending ovulation. LH can be detected by urinary ovulation predictor kits (OPK, also LH-kit) that are performed, typically daily, around the time ovulation may be expected. A conversion from a negative to a positive reading would suggest that ovulation is about to occur within 24–48 hours, giving women two days to engage in sexual intercourse or artificial insemination with the intention of conceiving.

The recommended testing frequency differs between manufacturers. For example, the Clearblue test is taken daily, and an increased frequency does not decrease the risk of missing an LH surge. On the other hand, the Chinese company &quot;Nantong Egens Biotechnology&quot; recommends using their test twice per day. If testing once per day, no significant difference has been found between testing LH in the morning versus in the evening, in relation to conception rates, and recommendations of what time in the day to take the test varies between manufacturers and healthcare workers. Tests may be read manually using a color-change paper strip, or digitally with the assistance of reading electronics.

Tests for luteinizing hormone may be combined with testing for estradiol in tests such as the Clearblue fertility monitor.

The sensitivity of LH tests are measured in milli international unit, with tests commonly available in the range 10–40 m.i.u. (the lower the number, the higher the sensitivity).

As sperm can stay viable in the woman for several days, LH tests are not recommended for contraceptive practices, as the LH surge typically occurs after the beginning of the fertile window.

== Disease states ==

=== Excess ===

In children with precocious puberty of pituitary or central origin, LH and FSH levels may be in the reproductive range instead of the low levels typical for their age.

During the reproductive years, relatively elevated LH is frequently seen in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome; however, it would be unusual for them to have LH levels outside of the normal reproductive range.

Persistently high LH levels are indicative of situations where the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to a pituitary production of both LH and FSH. While this is typical in menopause, it is abnormal in the reproductive years. There it may be a sign of:
# Premature menopause
# Gonadal dysgenesis, Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome
# Castration
# Swyer syndrome
# Polycystic ovary syndrome
# Certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
# Testicular failure
# Pregnancy – BetaHCG can mimic LH so tests may show elevated LH

Note: A medical drug for inhibiting luteinizing hormone secretion is butinazocine.

=== Deficiency ===

Diminished secretion of LH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifest in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, amenorrhea is commonly observed. Conditions with very low LH secretions include:
# Pasqualini syndrome
# Kallmann syndrome
# Hypothalamic suppression
# Hypopituitarism
# Eating disorder
# Female athlete triad
# Hyperprolactinemia
# Hypogonadism
# Gonadal suppression therapy
## GnRH antagonist
## GnRH agonist (inducing an initial stimulation (flare up) followed by permanent blockage of the GnRH pituitary receptor)

== As a medication ==
Luteinizing hormone is available mixed with FSH in the form of menotropin, and other forms of urinary gonadotropins. More purified forms of urinary gonadotropins may reduce the LH portion in relation to FSH. Recombinant luteinizing hormone is available as lutropin alfa (Luveris).

== Role in phosphorylation ==
Phosphorylation is a biochemical process that involves the addition of phosphate to an organic compound. Steroidogenesis entails processes by which cholesterol is converted to biologically active steroid hormones. A study shows that LH via a PKA signaling pathway regulates the phosphorylation and localization of DRP1 within mitochondria of the steroidogenic cells of the ovary.

<text>Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) is a social democratic organization established in 1972 as the successor of the Socialist Party of America (SPA). The SPA had stopped running independent presidential candidates though retains the term &quot;party&quot; in their name.

SDUSA, which was fiercely anti-communist, pursued a strategy of political realignment intended to organize labor unions, civil rights organizations and other constituencies into a coalition that would transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party. The realignment strategy emphasized working with unions and especially the AFL–CIO, putting an emphasis on economic issues that would unite working class voters. SDUSA opposed the Senator George McGovern&#x27;s &quot;New Leftist&quot; approach, pointing to the rout suffered in the 1972 presidential election. As a result, some SDUSA members, like Penn Kemble and Joshua Muravchik, were associated with neoconservatism. SDUSA&#x27;s activities have included sponsoring discussions and issuing position papers. SDUSA has included civil rights activists and leaders of labor unions such as Bayard Rustin, Norman Hill and Tom Kahn of the AFL–CIO as well as Sandra Feldman and Rachelle Horowitz of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Internationally, the group supported the dissident Polish labor organization Solidarity and several anti-communist political movements in global hot spots. Using the &quot;social democrat&quot; label rather than &quot;socialist&quot; was meant to disassociate the group from the Soviet Union. SDUSA, while social democratic, is also still &quot;committed to the vibrant democratic socialist movement&quot;.

SDUSA&#x27;s politics were criticized by former SPA chairman Michael Harrington, who in 1972 announced that he favored an immediate pull-out of American forces from Vietnam and coined the term &quot;neoconservative&quot;. After losing all votes at the 1972 convention that changed the SPA to SDUSA, Harrington resigned in 1973 to form the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, the forerunner of the Democratic Socialists of America.

== Socialist Party of America ==
By the early 1970s, the Socialist Party of America (SPA) was publicly associated with A. Philip Randolph, the civil rights and labor union leader; and with Michael Harrington, the author of &quot;The Other America&quot;. Even before the 1972 convention, Harrington had resigned as an Honorary Chairperson of the SPA &quot;because he was upset about the group’s failure to enthusiastically support George McGovern and because of its views on the Vietnam War&quot;.

In its 1972 Convention, the SPA had two Co-Chairmen, Bayard Rustin and Charles S. Zimmerman of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU); and a First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser, who were re-elected by acclamation. In his opening speech to the Convention, Co-Chairman Bayard Rustin called for SDUSA to organize against the &quot;reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration&quot; and Rustin also criticized the &quot;irresponsibility and élitism of the &#x27;New Politics&#x27; liberals&quot;.

The party changed its name to Social Democrats, USA, by a vote of 73 to 34. Changing the name of the Socialist Party of America to Social Democrats, USA, was intended to be &quot;realistic&quot; as the intention was to respond to the end of the running of actual SPA candidates for office and to respond to the confusions of Americans. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored Darlington Hoopes as candidate for President in 1956 and who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only six states. Because the SPA no longer sponsored party candidates in elections, continued use of the name &quot;party&quot; was &quot;misleading&quot; and hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party according to the majority report. The name &quot;Socialist&quot; was replaced by &quot;Social Democrats&quot; because many American associated the term &quot;socialism&quot; with Marxism–Leninism. Moreover, the organization sought to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the Socialist Workers Party and the Socialist Labor Party.

During the 1972 Convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one. The Convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, eight seats for the Coalition Caucus of Harrington, two for the left-wing Debs Caucus and one for the independent Samuel H. Friedman. Friedman and the minority caucuses had opposed the name change.

The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote. On foreign policy, the program called for &quot;firmness toward Communist aggression&quot;. However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed &quot;any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission&quot; and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington&#x27;s proposal for a ceasefire and immediate withdrawal of American forces was defeated. Harrington complained that after its convention the SPA had endorsed George McGovern only with a statement loaded with &quot;constructive criticism&quot; and that it had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. The majority caucus&#x27;s Arch Puddington replied that the California branch was especially active in supporting McGovern while the New York branch were focusing on a congressional race.

When the SPA changed its name to SDUSA, Bayard Rustin became its public spokesman. According to Rustin, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party. A strategy of re-alignment was particularly associated with Max Shachtman.

Some months after the convention, Harrington resigned his membership in SDUSA and he and some of his supporters from the Coalition Caucus soon formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC). Many members of the Debs Caucus resigned from SDUSA and some of them formed the Socialist Party USA. The changing of the name of the SPA to SDUSA and the 1973 formation of DSOC and the SPUSA represented a split in the American socialist movement.

In 1973, SDUSA claimed 1,800 members.

== Early years ==
In domestic politics, the SDUSA leadership emphasized the role of the American labor movement in advancing civil rights and economic justice. The domestic program followed the recommendations of Rustin&#x27;s article &quot;From Protest to Politics&quot; in which Rustin analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban black working class, particularly in the Northern United States. The needs of the black community demanded a shift in political strategy, where blacks would need to strengthen their political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues and the like) to pursue a common economic agenda. It was time to move from protest to politics, wrote Rustin. A particular danger facing the black community was the chimera of identity politics, particularly the rise of Black Power which Rustin dismissed as a fantasy of middle-class African-Americans that repeated the political and moral errors of previous black nationalists while alienating the white allies needed by the black community.

SDUSA documents had similar criticisms of the agendas advanced by middle class activists increasing their role in the Democratic Party. SDUSA members stated concerns about an exaggerated role of middle-class peace activists in the Democratic Party, particularly associated with the &quot;New Politics&quot; of Senator George McGovern, whose presidential candidacy was viewed as an ongoing disaster for the Democratic Party and for the United States. In electoral politics, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party.

In foreign policy, most of the founding SDUSA leadership called for an immediate cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam. They demanded a negotiated peace treaty to end the Vietnam War, but the majority opposed a unilateral withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, suggesting that such a withdrawal would lead to an annihilation of the free labor unions and of the political opposition. After the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam and the victory of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Viet Cong, SDUSA supported humanitarian assistance to refugees and condemned Senator McGovern for his failure to support such assistance.

== Organizational activities ==

SDUSA was governed by biannual conventions which invited the participation of interested observers. These gatherings featured discussions and debates over proposed resolutions, some of which were adopted as organizational statements. The group frequently made use of outside speakers at these events: non-SDUSA intellectuals ranged from neoconservatives like Jeane Kirkpatrick on the right to democratic socialists like Paul Berman on the left and similarly a range of academic, political and labor-union leaders were invited. These meetings also functioned as reunions for political activists and intellectuals, some of whom worked together for decades. SDUSA also published a newsletter and occasional position papers, issued statements supporting labor unions and workers&#x27; interests at home and overseas, the existence of Israel and the Israeli labor movement. From 1979–1989, SDUSA members were organized to support of Solidarity, the independent labor union of Poland.

The organization also attempted to exert influence through endorsements of presidential candidates. The group&#x27;s 1976 National Convention, held in New York City, formally endorsed the Democratic ticket of Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale and pledged the group to &quot;work enthusiastically&quot; for the election of the pair in November. The organization took a less assertive approach during the divisive 1980 campaign, marked as it was by a heated primary challenge to President Carter by Senator Edward Kennedy and SDUSA chose not to hold its biannual convention until after the termination of the fall campaign. The election of conservative Ronald Reagan was chalked up to the failure of the Democrats to &quot;appeal to their traditional working class constituency&quot;.

Early in 1980, long-time National Director Carl Gershman resigned his position to be replaced by Rita Freedman. Freedman previously had served as organizer and chair of SDUSA&#x27;s key New York local.

SDUSA dues were paid annually in advance, with members receiving a copy of the organization&#x27;s official organ, the tabloid-sized newspaper &quot;New America&quot;. The dues rate was $25 per year in 1983.

== Hiatus and re-foundation ==
Following the death of the organization&#x27;s &quot;Notesonline&quot; editor Penn Kemble of cancer on October 15, 2005, SDUSA lapsed into a state of organizational hiatus, with no further issues of the online newsletter produced or updates to the group&#x27;s website made.

Following several years of inactivity, an attempt was subsequently made to revive SDUSA. In 2008, a group composed initially mostly of Pennsylvania members of SDUSA emerged, determined to re-launch the organization. A re-founding convention of the SDUSA was held May 3, 2009, at which a National Executive Committee was elected.

Owing to factional disagreements, a group based in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and the newly elected National Executive Committee parted company, with the former styling itself as the Social Democrats, USA – Socialist Party USA and the latter as Social Democrats, USA.

Two additional conventions took place since the 2009 reformation, an internet teleconference on September 1, 2010, featuring presentations by guest speakers Herb Engstrom of the California Democratic Party Executive Committee and Roger Clayman, Executive Director of the Long Island Labor Federation; and a convention held August 26–27, 2012, in Buffalo, New York, with a keynote address delivered by Richard Lipsitz, executive director of Western New York Labor Federation.

== Controversies ==
=== Anti-communism ===

Michael Harrington charged that its &quot;obsessive anti-communism&quot; rendered SDUSA politically conservative. In contrast, Harrington&#x27;s DSOC and DSA criticized Marxism–Leninism, but he opposed many defense-and-diplomatic policies against the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc. Harrington voiced admiration for German Chancellor Willy Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; which sought to reduce Western distrust of and hostility towards the Eastern Bloc and so entice the Soviet Union reciprocally to reduce its aggressive military posture.

=== Max Shachtman and alleged Trotskyism ===
SDUSA leaders have served in the administrations of Presidents since the 1980 and the service of some members in Republican administrations has been associated with controversy. SDUSA members like Gershman were called &quot;State Department socialists&quot; by , who wrote that the foreign policy of the Reagan administration was being run by Trotskyists, a claim that was called a &quot;myth&quot; by . This &quot;Trotskyist&quot; charge has been repeated and even widened by journalist Michael Lind in 2003 to assert a takeover of the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration by former Trotskyists. Lind&#x27;s &quot;amalgamation of the defense intellectuals with the traditions and theories of &quot;the largely Jewish-American Trotskyist movement [in Lind&#x27;s words]&quot; was criticized in 2003 by University of Michigan professor Alan M. Wald, who had discussed Trotskyism in his history of &quot;the New York intellectuals&quot;. SDUSA and allegations that &quot;Trotskyists&quot; subverted Bush&#x27;s foreign policy have been mentioned by &quot;self-styled&quot; paleoconservatives (conservative opponents of neoconservatism).

Harrington and Tom Kahn had been associated with Max Shachtman, a Marxist theorist who had broken with Leon Trotsky because of his criticism of the Soviet Union as being a totalitarian class-society after having supported Trotsky in the 1930s. Although Schachtman died in 1972 before the Socialist Party was renamed as SDUSA, Shachtman&#x27;s ideas continued to influence Albert Shanker and The American Federation of Teachers, which was often associated with SDUSA members. Decades later, conflicts in the AFL–CIO were roughly split in 1995 along the lines of the conflict between the &quot;Shachtmanite Social Democrats and the Harringtonite Democratic Socialists of America, with the Social Democrats supporting Kirkland and Donahue and the Democratic Socialists supporting Sweeney&quot;.

=== Alleged conservatism or neoconservatism ===

Author Justin Vaisse considers some SDUSA members &quot;right-wing social democrats&quot;, a taunt according to Wattenberg.

SDUSA members supported Solidarity, the independent labor-union of Poland. The organizer of the AFL–CIO&#x27;s support for Solidarity, SDUSA&#x27;s Tom Kahn, criticized Jeane Kirkpatrick&#x27;s &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;, arguing that democracy should be promoted even in the countries dominated by Soviet Communism. In 1981, leading Social Democrats and some moderate Republicans wanted to use economic aid to Poland as leverage to expand the freedom of association in 1981, whereas Caspar Weinberger and neoconservative Jeane Kirkpatrick preferred to force the communist government of Poland to default on its international payments so they would lose credibility. Kahn argued for his position in a 1981 debate with neoconservative Norman Podhoretz, who like Kirkpatrick and Weinberger opposed all credits. In 1982, Kirkpatrick called similarly for Western assistance to Poland to be used to help Solidarity.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;, then owned by Graham Holdings, had called some of SDUSA&#x27;s former members neoconservatives. Justin Vaisse listed five SDUSA associates as &quot;second-generation neoconservatives&quot; and &quot;so-called Shachtmanites&quot;, including &quot;Penn Kemble, Joshua Muravchik... and Bayard Rustin&quot;. Throughout his life, Penn Kemble called himself a social democrat and objected to being called a neoconservative. Kemble and Joshua Muravchik were never followers of Max Shachtman. On the contrary, Kemble was recruited by a non-Shachtmanite professor, according to Muravchik, who wrote: &quot;Although Shachtman was one of the elder statesmen who occasionally made stirring speeches to us, no YPSL [Young People&#x27;s Socialist League] of my generation was a Shachtmanite&quot;. Besides objecting to being called a &quot;neoconservative&quot;, Kemble &quot;sharply criticized the Bush administration&#x27;s approach on [Iraq]. &#x27;The distinction between liberation and democratization, which requires a strategy and instruments, was an idea never understood by the administration,&#x27; he told the &quot;New Republic&quot;&quot;, wrote &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in Kemble&#x27;s obituary.

==== Former member Joshua Muravchik ====
Joshua Muravchik has identified himself as a neoconservative. When Muravhchik appeared at the 2003 SDUSA conference, he was criticized by SDUSA members: Rachelle Horowitz, another Social Democrats, USA, luminary and an event organizer, called Muravchik&#x27;s comments &quot;profoundly disturbing&quot;—both his use of &quot;us and them&quot; rhetoric and the term &quot;evil.&quot; The existence of evil in the world was something Horowitz was happy to concede, she said from the floor. But it was a word incapable of clear political definition and thus a producer of muddle rather than clarity, zeal rather than political action. Then Herf jumped in with similar criticisms. And then Berman. And Ibrahim. And before long, more or less everyone else in the room. There was still something, it seemed, that separated them from the neocons who hovered over the proceedings both as opponents and inspirations. Muravchik wanted to pull them somewhere most of the attendees—and organizers—were unwilling to go. Among Joshua Muravchick&#x27;s SDUSA critics was his own father Emanuel Muravchik (a Norman Thomas socialist). His mother was too upset with Joshua&#x27;s &quot;Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism&quot; to attend the discussion. On the other hand, Joshua Muravchik was called a &quot;second-generation neoconservative&quot; by Vaisse.

<doc id="248601" wikidata="Q913311" url="?curid=248601" title="A Hard Day's Night (film)">
<text>A Hard Day&#x27;s Night is a 1964 musical comedy film starring the English rock band the Beatles – John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr – that was released during the height of Beatlemania. Directed by Richard Lester, it was written by Alun Owen and originally released by United Artists. The musical soundtrack makes up the band&#x27;s album of the same name. The film portrays 36 hours in the lives of the group as they prepare for a television performance.

The film was a commercial and critical success and was nominated for two Academy Awards, including Best Original Screenplay. Forty years after its release, &quot;Time&quot; magazine rated it as one of the 100 all-time greatest films. British critic Leslie Halliwell described it as a &quot;comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with the director trying every cinematic gag in the book&quot; and awarded it a full four stars. The film is credited as being one of the most influential of all musical films, inspiring the Monkees&#x27; television show and pop music videos, and various other low-budget musical film vehicles starring British pop groups, such as the Gerry and the Pacemakers film &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; (1965).

In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked it the 88th-greatest British film of the 20th century.

== Plot ==

The four Beatles evade a horde of fans while boarding a train for London to film a televised variety show concert. En route, they meet Paul McCartney&#x27;s trouble-making Irish grandfather, John. Before arriving in London, the band entertains some schoolgirls and plays cards with their manager, Norm, and road manager, Shake. They are quickly driven from the station to a hotel and begin to feel confined. Norm brings each Beatle a pile of fan mail and tasks them with answering each letter, but they sneak out to party. Norm and Shake catch them and order them back to the room, where they find out that Paul&#x27;s grandfather has gone to a gambling club using an invitation sent to Ringo; they track him down and bring him back to the hotel.

The next day, the Beatles arrive at a TV studio for rehearsals. The television producer assumes bad faith in them due to something Paul&#x27;s grandfather said. After a mundane cocktail reception where the group tease reporters with comic and evasive answers to interview questions, they leave through a fire escape and cavort in a field until forced off by its caretaker. Back in the studio, they are separated when a woman thinks she recognises John Lennon but cannot recall who he is. George Harrison is mistaken for an actor, dragged into an advertising agent&#x27;s office, and auditioned for a clothing advertisement, but offends the agent by calling the shirts he is presented with &quot;grotesque&quot;. The band returns to rehearse a second song and, after a quick trip to makeup, smoothly goes through a third before earning a break.

An hour before the final run-through, Ringo Starr is cajoled into chaperoning Paul&#x27;s grandfather to the studio canteen for tea. He takes issue with a book Ringo is reading and manipulates him into going out &quot;parading&quot; to experience life rather than reading about it in books. Ringo tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, takes pictures, walks alongside the River Thames, and rides a bicycle along a railway station platform. After being ejected from the pub for nearly injuring a parrot with a dart and accidentally causing a woman to fall into a newly dug hole at a construction site, Ringo is apprehended by a policeman. He is shortly joined by Paul&#x27;s grandfather, who had triggered a ruckus attempting to sell Beatles photos with autographs he had forged. The grandfather antagonises the policemen at the station with Irish nationalist slogans before running back to the studio to tell the others about Ringo. Norm sends the other three Beatles to retrieve him, which leads to a Keystone Cops-style foot chase. Arriving back at the studio with only minutes to spare before airtime, the Beatles deliver a smashing performance to an audience of screaming, delirious fans. Immediately afterwards, a helicopter whisks the group away toward a &quot;midnight matinée&quot; engagement in Wolverhampton. Paul tosses the forged autographs out of the helicopter as it takes off.

== Songs ==
The film&#x27;s credits incorrectly state that all songs are composed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney – a portion of &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, written by George Harrison, is heard during one scene. The instrumental versions were recorded by the George Martin Orchestra.

In addition to the soundtrack album, an EP (in mono) of songs from the film titled &quot;Extracts From The Film A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was released by Parlophone on 6 November 1964, having the following tracks:
* Side A

# &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;
# &quot;If I Fell&quot;
* Side B

# &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;
# &quot;And I Love Her&quot;

=== Song notes ===
* &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot; was among several songs considered for the film but ultimately not included either as an on-camera performance or for usage as an audio-only track. It was to be used during the police chase sequence, but ultimately, director Richard Lester vetoed it in favour of the more lyrically upbeat &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;. Its status as an early contender for inclusion led to the song being included on the US soundtrack album, plus the mono “Something New” LP and Capitol 45. The song was recorded in two sections and was going to be featured in two parts, with the break being when the Beatles returned to the police station to catch their breath. The unique full-length version, which has a repeat of the first verse, was mixed as a rough mono mix and sent to United Artists and Capitol Records in North America. This “lost” section wasn’t just an edit of the beginning of the song but a separate take (second “section” of the two-part recording). Eventually, the final mono and stereo mixes edit out this repeat of the first verse.
* In the 1982 US theatrical reissue of the film by Universal Pictures, under licence from Walter Shenson, the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot; was used as the audio track for a prologue sequence to the film which consisted of stills from the film and publicity photographs as a tribute to Lennon consisting of a Swinging Sixties-style collage of photos of the Beatles in 1964 around the time they were shooting the film. The prologue was assembled without the involvement or knowledge of the film&#x27;s director, Richard Lester, who subsequently expressed his disapproval of the addition. The prologue was not included on the 2000 restoration of the film.
* The song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; was filmed as part of the film&#x27;s TV concert sequence but was not included in the final cut of the film. At a point before a decision had been made to excise the song from the film, footage of that performance had been sent by the filmmakers and Brian Epstein to be aired on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; as a tease to promote the forthcoming release of the film. The clip aired on the Sullivan Show on Sunday, 24 May 1964, in conjunction with an interview with The Beatles specially filmed by Sullivan in London. An extract of the footage of the song performance was included in the 1994 documentary &quot;The Making of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;&quot;.
* The song &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; was cut from the film for unknown reasons.

== Screenplay ==
The screenplay was written by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play &quot;No Trams to Lime Street&quot;, and he had shown an aptitude for writing in the group&#x27;s native Scouse dialect. McCartney commented, &quot;Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might&#x27;ve heard us speak, so I thought he did a very good script.&quot; Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like &quot;a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room&quot;; Paul&#x27;s grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and recording having become punishing.

The script comments cheekily on the Beatles&#x27; fame. For instance, at one point, a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she cannot put a name to the face, saying only &quot;you are...&quot;. He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for &quot;him&quot;; after she puts on her glasses, she agrees that Lennon doesn&#x27;t &quot;look like him at all&quot;, and Lennon says to himself that &quot;she looks more like him than I do&quot;. Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles; when Ringo is asked if he is a mod or a rocker, he replies: &quot;Uh, no, I&#x27;m a mocker&quot;, a line derived from a joke he had made on the TV show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; The frequent reference to McCartney&#x27;s grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a &quot;clean old man&quot; both refers to the Beatles being popularly called “very clean” and inverts the stock description of Brambell&#x27;s character on the TV series &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; as a &quot;dirty old man&quot;.

Audiences also responded to the Beatles&#x27; brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, &quot;The general aim of the film was to present what was apparently becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy is too strong a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, talk to the people on the train who &#x27;fought the war for them&#x27; as they liked. ... [Everything was] still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this... they said if you want something, do it. You can do it. Forget all this talk about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it.&quot;

Although the original working titles of the film were first &quot;The Beatles&quot; and then &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, the group&#x27;s name is never spoken in the film.

== Production ==
The Beatles had met with Nat Cohen of Anglo Amalgamated about Anglo financing a film. The meeting came though Cohen&#x27;s partner, Stuart Levy, who knew Brian Epstein&#x27;s parents. However Cohen turned down the group. 

The film was shot for United Artists using a cinéma vérité style influenced by the French New Wave and British kitchen sink realism in black-and-white. The film was meant to be released in July 1964, and since it was already March when filming began, the entire film had to be produced over a period of sixteen weeks. The film had a low budget for its time of £200,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) and filming was finished in under seven weeks, leaving the rest of the time for post-production. At first, the film itself was a secondary consideration to United Artists, whose primary interest was in being able to release the soundtrack album in the United States before the Beatles&#x27; American label Capitol Records could; in the words of Bud Ornstein, the European head of production for United Artists: &quot;Our record division wants to get the soundtrack album to distribute in the States, and what we lose on the film we&#x27;ll get back on this disc.&quot; According to film historian Stephen Glynn, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was intended as &quot;a low-budget exploitation film to milk the latest brief musical craze for all it was worth.&quot;

Unlike most productions, the film was shot in near sequential order, as stated by Lennon in 1964. Filming began on 2 March 1964 at Marylebone station in London; the four Beatles had joined the British actors&#x27; union, Equity, only that morning. The first week of filming took place on a train travelling between London and Minehead, Somerset. On 10 March, scenes with Ringo were shot at the Turk&#x27;s Head pub in Twickenham, and over the following week various interior scenes were filmed at Twickenham Studios. From 23 to 30 March, filming moved to the Scala Theatre in Fitzrovia, and on 31 March, concert footage was shot there, although the group mimed to backing tracks. On the 17 March and the 17 April scenes were shot at the Les Ambassadeurs Club in Mayfair. The &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; segment, which featured creative camera work such as undercranking and the band running and jumping around in a field, was shot on 23 April 1964 at Thornbury Playing Fields, Isleworth. The final scene was filmed the following day in West Ealing, where Ringo obligingly drops his coat over puddles for a lady to step on, only to discover that the final puddle is actually a large hole.

Before &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was released in America, a United Artists executive asked Lester to dub the Beatles&#x27; voices with Mid-Atlantic accents. McCartney angrily replied, &quot;Look, if we can understand a fucking cowboy talking Texan, they can understand us talking Liverpool.&quot; Lester subsequently directed the Beatles&#x27; 1965 film, &quot;Help!&quot;

The film&#x27;s costumes—except for those of the Beatles themselves—were the work of future Academy Award-winning designer Julie Harris. The clothes of the Beatles were credited to Dougie Millings &amp; Son.

=== Casting ===
Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, who played Paul McCartney&#x27;s fictional grandfather, John McCartney, was already well known to British television audiences as a co-star in the sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;. The recurring joke that he was very &quot;clean&quot; reflects a contrast to his sitcom role, where he was always referred to as a &quot;dirty old man&quot;. For American audiences, the comment was more of a spoof on the Beatles continually being referenced as &quot;very clean&quot;. Norman Rossington played the Beatles&#x27; manager Norm, John Junkin played the group&#x27;s road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti played the television director.

The supporting cast included Richard Vernon as the &quot;city gent&quot; on the train and Lionel Blair as a featured dancer. There were also various cameos. John Bluthal played a car thief and an uncredited Derek Nimmo appeared as magician Leslie Jackson. David Janson (billed as David Jaxon here) played the small boy met by Ringo on his &quot;walkabout&quot;. Rooney Massara, who went on to compete in the 1972 Munich Olympics, was the sculler in the river in the &quot;walkabout&quot; scene by the river at Kew (uncredited). Kenneth Haigh appeared as an advertising executive who mistakes George for a &quot;new phenomenon&quot;. David Langton also made a cameo appearance as an actor in the dressing room scene.

Mal Evans, one of the Beatles&#x27; road managers, also appears briefly in the film—moving an upright bass through a tight hallway as Lennon talks with the woman who mistakes him for someone else.

George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, on the set when she made a brief (uncredited) appearance as one of the schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned because she had a boyfriend at the time, but he persisted and they were married within 18 months. The girl with Boyd in the dining car scene is Prudence Bury. Phil Collins, later a member of the band Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience and would subsequently go on to be a very successful musician in his own right.

Playing the buxom woman with Paul&#x27;s grandfather in the casino scene was popular British 1960s pinup model Margaret Nolan, who also appeared as &quot;Dink&quot;, the golden girl during the opening credits of the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, later that same year.

=== Cut for BBFC ===
The film had to be edited slightly to obtain the U certificate for British cinemas. The phrase &quot;get knotted&quot; (allegedly in reel 7 of the original submission) was judged inappropriate for a U film and had to be removed. When the film was submitted for release on VHS, the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) could not locate the phrase and presumed that the clip was &quot;pre-cut&quot;, but stated that the phrase was no longer of any concern. The BBFC noted a number of innuendos and one subtle reference to cocaine, but concluded that it was still within the &quot;natural category&quot; for a U certificate.

== Reception ==

The film premiered at the Pavilion Theatre in London on 6 July 1964. The film and its soundtrack were widely released on 10July. &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; set records at the London Pavilion by grossing over $20,000 in the first week (equivalent to $ in ), ultimately becoming so popular that more than 1,600 prints were in circulation simultaneously. The film opened in 500 theatres in the United States and Canada on 12August. In its initial run it grossed $14 million (equivalent to $ million in).

=== Critical response ===
Contemporary reviews of the film were mostly positive; one oft-quoted assessment was provided by Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, who deemed it &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of jukebox musicals.&quot; When &quot;The Village Voice&quot; published the results of its first annual film poll, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; placed second among the films of 1964, behind only &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, despite its age, is still a delight to watch and has proven itself to be a rock-and-roll movie classic.&quot; It is number four on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; list of the Top Ten Musicals and Performing Arts films. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 96 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film &quot;One of the smoothest, freshest, funniest films ever made for purposes of exploitation.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert described the film as &quot;one of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies&quot;, and added it to his list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine named &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; the 42nd greatest British film of all time. In 2005, Time.com named it one of the 100 best films of the last 80 years. Leslie Halliwell gave the film his highest rating, four stars, the only British film of 1964 to achieve that accolade.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther noted that the film was a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves, faced with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them and mock youth culture at large. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; critic Brendan Gill wrote: &quot;Though I don&#x27;t pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds.&quot;

&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was nominated for two Academy Awards: for Best Screenplay (Alun Owen), and Best Score (Adaptation) (George Martin).

== Influence ==
British critic Leslie Halliwell states the film&#x27;s influence as &quot;it led directly to all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties&quot;. In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring the Monkees&#x27; television series. The &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester&#x27;s earlier &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot;, and it is this segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing &quot;a new grammar&quot;: &quot;he influenced many other films. Today, when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;&quot;. Film theorist James Monroe writes, &quot;The lively 1960s films of Richard Lester—especially his Musicals &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966)—popularised jump cuts, rapid and &#x27;ungrammatical&#x27; cutting. Over time, his brash editorial style became a norm, now celebrated every night around the world in hundreds of music videos on MTV and in countless commercials.&quot; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; also inspired a 1965 film featuring Gerry and the Pacemakers, entitled &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;. In an interview for the DVD re-release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Lester said he had been labelled the father of MTV and had jokingly responded by asking for a paternity test.

== Title ==
The film&#x27;s title originated from something said by Ringo Starr, who described it this way in an interview with disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: &quot;We went to do a job, and we&#x27;d worked all day, and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day, I suppose, and I said, &#x27;It&#x27;s been a hard day ...&#x27; and I looked around and saw it was dark, so I said, &#x27;... night!&#x27; So we came to &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.&quot;

According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine: &quot;I was going home in the car, and Dick Lester suggested the title, &#x27;Hard Day&#x27;s Night&#x27; from something Ringo had said. I had used it in &quot;In His Own Write&quot;, but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny... just said it. So Dick Lester said, &#x27;We are going to use that title.&#x27;&quot;

In a 1994 interview for &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon&#x27;s recollections, recalling that it was the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come up with the idea of using Starr&#x27;s verbal misstep: &quot;The title was Ringo&#x27;s. We&#x27;d almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we&#x27;d not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, &#x27;Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.&#x27; Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, &#x27;Phew, it&#x27;s been a hard day&#x27;s night.&#x27;&quot;

Yet another version of events appeared in 1996; producer Walter Shenson said that Lennon had described to him some of Starr&#x27;s funnier gaffes, including &quot;a hard day&#x27;s night&quot;, whereupon Shenson immediately decided that that was going to be the title of the film.

Regardless of which of these origin stories is the true one, the original tentative title for the film had been &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, and when the new title was agreed upon, it became necessary to write and quickly record a new title song, which was completed on 16 April, just eight days before filming was finished. John Lennon wrote the song (credited to Lennon–McCartney) in one night, writing the lyrics on the back of a birthday card sent to his young son Julian, and it went on to win a Grammy for Best Performance by a Vocal Group.

The film was titled &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot; in Germany and Sweden, &quot;Tutti Per Uno&quot; (All for One) in Italy, &quot;Quatre garçons dans le vent&quot; (Four Boys in the Wind) in France &quot;Yeah! Yeah! Tässä tulemme! &quot; (Yeah! Yeah! Here We Come!) in Finland and &quot;Os Reis do Iê-Iê-Iê&quot; (The Kings of Yeah-yeah-yeah) in Brazil.

== Novelisation ==
In 1964, Pan Books published a novelisation of the film by the author John Burke, described as &quot;based on the original screenplay by Alun Owen&quot;. The book was priced at two shillings and sixpence and contained an 8-page section of photographs from the film. It is the first book in the English language to have the word &#x27;grotty&#x27; in print.

* 1964: &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was released by United Artists.
* 1967: The film premiered on American television on the NBC network on 24 October; the usual Peacock introduction, which preceded all NBC colour broadcasts of the era, was replaced by a humorous black-and-white animated cartoon penguin, with cartoon representations of the Beatles jumping out of its stomach, as &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was not shot in colour;
* 1970: The film premiered on UK television on BBC1 on 28 December. John Lennon watched the broadcast at home and was inspired to write the song &quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest&quot;, which was later recorded by Ringo Starr on his 1973 album &quot;Ringo&quot;.
* 1979: Rights to the film were transferred to its producer, Walter Shenson.
* 1982: Universal Pictures, under license from Shenson, reissued the film in theatres. This release included a prologue consisting of production stills set to the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot;, which would remain on subsequent home video editions until 2000.
* 1984: MPI Home Video, under license from Shenson, first released &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; on home video in the VHS, Betamax, CED Videodisc, and Laserdisc formats, which all included the prologue.
** The film was also released by Janus Films as part of The Criterion Collection in both a single-disc CLV and a two-disc CAV Laserdisc format. The additional features section on the CAV edition includes the original theatrical trailer, an interview with Richard Lester, and his &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot;.
** There were notable pitch problems with the songs in this version, precisely one semitone lower than the original recordings. This was fixed in subsequent releases.
* 1993: Voyager Company produced a CD-ROM for Mac and PC platforms with video in QuickTime 1 format, containing most of Criterion&#x27;s elements, including the original script.
* 1997: MPI Home Video released the first DVD edition. It contains the 1982 prologue and trailer, newsreels, an interview with Richard Lester, and &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot;.
* 2000: Miramax Films reissued the film in theatres in the United States and then as a collector&#x27;s edition DVD two years later, as well as its final issue in the VHS format. The film had been transferred from the restored 35 mm negative and presented in 1.66:1 Widescreen. The prologue that Universal added in 1982 is absent on the Miramax releases.
** In addition to the original film, the DVD edition contained a bonus disc with over 7 hours of additional material, including interviews with cast and crew members and Beatles associates. The DVD was produced by Beatles historian and producer Martin Lewis, a longtime friend of Walter Shenson.
* 2009: The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in Canada; however, the disc is region-free and will play in any Blu-ray machine. It contains most of the 2000 DVD bonus features.
* 2010: Miramax was sold by Disney to Filmyard Holdings, LLC, and the home video sub-licence transferred to Lionsgate, although no U.S. Blu-ray release date had been announced.
* 2011: A new Blu-ray edition was released in Mexico; this version has Spanish subtitles.
* 2014: Janus Films acquired the rights to the film from Miramax (on behalf of the Shenson Estate, managed by Bruce Karsh) and announced a domestic video re-release via The Criterion Collection on 24 June 2014. This dual-format edition (which incorporates the first-ever U.S. issue on Blu-ray) contains various supplements from all previous video re-issues. This marked the return of this film to Criterion for the first time in two decades. The film was also released in theatres across the U.S. and in the UK (by Metrodome in the latter region) on 4 July 2014. On 6 July 2014, the film was shown in re-mastered HD on BBC Four in the UK to mark its 50th anniversary. Criterion&#x27;s DVD/Blu-ray release of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was duplicated by Umbrella Entertainment in Australia (released 2 July) and Second Sight Films in the UK (released 21 July).
* 2015: On 15 December, Criterion re-released its Blu-ray as part of &quot;The Rock Box&quot;, a collection of rock music-related films that also includes &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; (1968), &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (1970) and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1979).
* 2022: On 11 August 2021, Criterion announced that its first 4K Ultra HD releases, a six-film slate, would include &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Criterion indicated that each title would be available in a 4K UHD+Blu-ray combo pack, including a 4K UHD disc of the feature film as well as the film and special features on the companion Blu-ray. &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was released on 18 January 2022.

=== 40th anniversary cast-and-crew-reunion screening ===
On 6 July 2004, the 40th anniversary of the film&#x27;s world premiere, a private cast-and-crew-reunion screening was hosted in London by DVD producer Martin Lewis. The screening was attended by McCartney, actors Victor Spinetti, John Junkin and David Janson, and many crew members. In media interviews at the event, McCartney disclosed that while he had seen the film many times on video, he had not seen the film on the &quot;big screen&quot; since its 1964 premiere.

<text>Voice acting in Japan is an industry where actors provide voice-overs as characters or narrators in media including anime, video games, audio dramas, commercials, and dubbing for non-Japanese films and television programs.

In Japan, and actresses have devoted fan clubs due to a crossover with the idol industry, and some fans may watch a show merely to hear a particular voice actor. Many voice actors have concurrent singing careers and have also crossed over to live-action media.

There are around 130 voice acting schools in Japan. Broadcast companies and talent agencies often have their own troupes of vocal actors. Magazines focusing specifically on voice acting are published in Japan, with &quot;Voice Animage&quot; being the longest running.

The term character voice (abbreviated CV) has been commonly used since the 1980s by such Japanese anime magazines as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Newtype&quot; to describe a voice actor associated with a particular anime or game character.

==Definition and role==

A provides voice-overs for characters and narration for various types of media, including anime, video games, audio dramas, live-action stunt and puppet shows, and commercials. A voice actor also provides dubbing for non-Japanese television programs and films. The initial term for voice actors in Japan was , but was later shortened to a compound word to make the word . While several voice actors opposed the term, believing it devalued their roles as actors, only after voice acting became more prominent did the word become more widespread.

There are three main factors that set voice actors and actors apart.

* Their professional upbringing by the , formed by NHK and other private networks during the golden age of radio .
* The lack of Japan-made movies and dramas forced TV networks to air foreign shows, which raised demand for voice actors.
* The boom in the anime world market, which produced a wave of young talents who wanted to become voice actors, rather than actors.

==History==
Voice acting has existed in Japan since the advent of radio. It was only in the 1970s that the term seiyū entered popular usage because of the anime &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;. According to a newspaper interview with a voice talent manager, &quot;Since the Yamato boom, the word &#x27;seiyū&#x27; has become instantly recognised; before that, actors and actresses who introduced themselves as seiyū were often asked, &#x27;You mean you work for Seiyu supermarket?

=== Early history ===
The earliest Japanese animation would predate the introduction of audio in film by at least a decade. Much like their live-action contemporaries during this period, screenings would have musical accompaniment and oftentimes include a &quot;benshi&quot; (narrator). The benshi would fulfill a role similar to ones in the Japanese puppet theater and magic lantern shows, where the narration would fill in dialogue and other story elements. With the introduction of sound in film, voices were often pulled from the available staff. For example, in &quot;Benkei tai Ushiwaka&quot; animator Kenzō Masaoka cast himself and his wife as the titular Benkei and Ushiwaka, respectively.

===Radio drama era===
In 1925, the Tokyo Broadcasting Company (predecessor to the NHK, Japan&#x27;s public broadcasting system) started radio broadcasts. In that same year, twelve students who were specialising in voice-only performances became the first voice actors in Japan when a performance of a radio drama was broadcast. They referred to themselves as &quot;seiyū&quot;, but in those days the term was used by newspapers to refer to the profession.

In 1941, NHK opened a training program to the public to prepare actors to specialise in radio dramas. This was called the . Then in 1942, the Tokyo Broadcasting Drama Troupe debuted its first performance. This was the second time that the term &quot;seiyū&quot; was used to refer to voice actors.

There are several theories as to how the term &quot;seiyū&quot; was coined. One theory is that Oyhashi Tokusaburo, a reporter for the Yomiuri Newspaper, coined the term. Another theory is that Tatsu Ooka, an entertainment programming managing producer for the NHK, came up with it.

At first, voice actors, like those at the Tokyo Radio Drama Troupe and similar companies specialised in radio dramas; with the advent of television, the term took on the additional meaning of one who does dubbing for animation. Television broadcasting aside, when radio was the leading mass medium, actors who played in radio dramas were not without their fans; for example, actors in the Nagoya Radio Drama troupe who played the lead love interest roles often received many fan letters.

===1950s: First voice actor boom===
Starting in the 1950s, a rise in the popularity of radio dramas as well as foreign television and film created many new opportunities for voice actors. After the , the &quot;Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai (NHK)&quot; began public broadcasting. Among these new broadcasts were several radio dramas, such as the 1952 drama &quot;&quot;, which would receive several adaptations on film, television, and stage due to its popularity.

Actors that were famous for their roles in dubbing and radio were used for their star power to voice similar characters in several anime productions. For example, Yasuo Yamada, who was famous for his Japanese dub of Clint Eastwood, was chosen to voice Lupin III for the &quot;Lupin the Third series.&quot;

===1960s===
In 1961, during the early days of commercial television broadcasting, the Five-Company Agreement (Gosha Agreement) caused the supply of Japanese movies that were available to Japanese television stations to dry up. As a result, in the 1960s many foreign dramas and other foreign programming was imported and dubbed into Japanese language for television broadcast.

At first, the NHK subtitled most foreign shows; however, shows dubbed in the Japanese language soon became the standard. At the centre of the first voice acting boom were actors like Nachi Nozawa, who dubbed the same foreign actors, in Nozawa&#x27;s case Alain Delon, Robert Redford, and Giuliano Gemma. Because of problems with pay guarantees arising from the Gosha Agreement, cinema actors were prevented from dubbing foreign movies for television. Television actors were also prevented from dubbing because of a similar agreement. This caused studios to turn to actors from the radio age and actors from the &quot;Shingeki&quot; style of acting. Around this time dubbing of foreign animation was done by Rakugo story tellers, Asakusa comedians, and the like, and voice actors were called &quot;dubbing talents&quot; if they specialised in dubbing, while those giving voice to a character went under the name of &quot;ateshi&quot;. It is during this golden age for dubbing that the Tokyo Actor&#x27;s Consumer&#x27;s Cooperative Society was founded. Later, Haikyo voice acting managers left and opened their own management agencies. Voice actors in Japan also voiced anime.

The first dubbed show broadcast in Japan was an episode of the American cartoon &quot;Superman&quot;, on October 9, 1955, on KRT (today TBS), and the first non-animated dubbed show broadcast was &quot;Cowboy G-Men&quot;, again by KRT, in 1956. Both were dubbed live; the first show to be broadcast with pre-recorded dubbing was on April 8, 1956.

===1970s: Second voice actor boom===
During the late 1970s, Akio Nojima, Kazuyuki Sogabe, Akira Kamiya, Tōru Furuya and Toshio Furukawa were the first to unite into a band, , and perform live. Many other voice actors released their own albums. At around 1979 the first anime magazines began to be published. The then editor-in-chief of Animage, Hideo Ogata, was the first to publish editorials on the ongoing transformation of voice actors into idols. Following his lead, the other magazines created &quot;seiyū corners&quot; with information and gossip about voice actors; this was one of the main causes of young anime fans yearning to become voice actors. This period also saw a gradual split of anime voice actors from their roots in theater. With the rise of voice actor specific training centers and audio-only productions, voice actors could start their careers working full time without any association to a broadcasting theater company. The term &quot;seiyu&quot; emerged to describe these voice actors who focused solely on voicing for anime productions. This boom lasted until the first half of the 1980s.

===1980s===
In 1989, the voice actors of the five main stars of the animated television show &quot;Ronin Warriors&quot; (Nozomu Sasaki, Takeshi Kusao, Hiroshi Takemura, Tomohiro Nishimura and Daiki Nakamura) formed an all-male singing group called &quot;NG5&quot;. The group was featured as the subject of a special documentary program on MBS.

During this period, voice acting production companies also began to provide specialised courses at on-site training schools specifically for training in animation dubbing.

===1990s===
The 1960s and 1970s booms were centered on media, such as the TV. In the 1990s, a new boom centred on more personal ways of communication, such as radio shows, Original Video Animation, television quizzes, public events and the Internet, gave way to the publication of the first dedicated voice acting magazines, and Voice Animage. Voice actors acquired many new fans thanks to the radio, and their CD sale figures increased. Concerts began to be held in the bigger halls. While the second boom also saw the voice actors become DJs, this time the recording houses backed the voice actor radio shows as sponsors, and large sums of money began to circulate. Megumi Hayashibara, Hekiru Shiina and Mariko Kouda are the first examples of this new trend. Recording companies and voice acting schools began to devise new ways to raise young voice actors.

When voice acting was introduced in television games, the same voice actors would perform in a series of events related to the television game world, making appearances and participating in radio programs based on the television games to attract the fanbase.

In the second half of the 1990s, the boom in the animation world led to the increase of anime shown in the Tokyo area. With the Internet, gathering information on their favourite voice actors became easy for fans, and voice actors began to appear in Internet-based radio shows.

From to , the world&#x27;s first digital satellite radio broadcaster, St.GIGA, transmitted episodic video games with voice acted overdubs in a separate and continually streaming vocal track (a technique called SoundLink), to be played in Japan on Nintendo&#x27;s Super Famicom video game console with its Satellaview peripheral. &quot;BS Zelda no Densetsu&quot; was identified by Nintendo as the world&#x27;s first integrated radio-game.

===2000–present: Idol and real-life crossovers===

During the mid-to-late 2000s, voice acting talents began crossing over with the Japanese idol industry. Prominent examples include Aya Hirano, Koharu Kusumi, and Nana Mizuki, all of whom were established actors or singers in mainstream entertainment before entering voice acting. While character song tie-ins were already common in the film industry by then, some voice actors also began making crossover television, stage, and concert appearances as their characters as well, leading them to be closely associated with one another. The term &quot;2.5D&quot;, which picked up frequent usage in the mid-2010s, was used to describe voice actors who would portray their characters in real life, such as television or stage plays. Over the mid-to-late 2010s, multimedia projects where the voice actors would appear as their characters in real-life became popular, such as &quot;The Idolmaster&quot; and &quot;Love Live!&quot; The magazine &quot;Seiyū Grand Prix&quot; noted that over 1,500 voice actors were active in 2021, compared to 370 voice actors (145 men and 225 women) in 2001.

<text>The West Somerset Railway (WSR) is a heritage railway line in Somerset, England. The freehold of the line and stations is owned by Somerset Council. The railway is leased to and operated by West Somerset Railway plc (WSR plc), which is supported and minority-owned by the West Somerset Railway Association (WSRA) charitable trust and the West Somerset Railway Heritage Trust (WSRHT). WSR operates services using both heritage steam and diesel trains.

It originally opened in 1862 between and . In 1874 it was extended from Watchet to by the Minehead Railway. Although just a single line, improvements were needed in the first half of the twentieth century to accommodate the significant number of tourists that wished to travel to the Somerset coast. The line was closed by British Rail in 1971 and reopened in 1976 as a heritage line.

It is the longest standard gauge independent heritage railway in the United Kingdom. Services normally operate over just the between Minehead and . During special events some trains continue a further to where a connection to Network Rail allows occasional through trains to operate onto the national network.

==History==
In 1845, when the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER) had recently completed its main line, there were proposals for a number of different and competitive railway schemes in west Somerset. A Bristol and English Channels Direct Junction Railway was proposed as a link from Watchet through Stogumber and Bishops Lydeard to Bridport on the south coast, which would be an alternative to ships taking a long and dangerous passage around Land&#x27;s End. This prompted the promotion of a connecting line from Williton to Minehead and Porlock, a line designed to attract tourists to Exmoor. Shortly afterwards, a Bristol and English Channels Connection Railway was suggested from Stolford to Bridport which would have passed through the Quantock Hills near Crowcombe. Alternatively, the Bridgwater and Minehead Junction Railway would link with the B&amp;ER at Bridgwater and run through Williton to Minehead with a branch to Watchet and a connecting Minehead and Central Devon Junction Railway would provide a line to Exeter. An alternative link to South Devon was proposed by the Exeter, Tiverton and Minehead Direct Railway through Dunster and offered an extension to Ilfracombe.

===West Somerset Railway Company===
None of these schemes were pursued and it was to be more than ten years before schemes for railways in the area were to be again proposed.

On 9 July 1856, local land owner Sir Peregrine Fuller Palmer Acland of Fairfield House, Stogursey arranged a meeting at the Egremont Hotel in Williton. The advertised purpose was to discuss a &quot;Railway from the West Somerset iron-fields and coast, to the Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway,&quot; proposed to connect Watchet – then a major port on the River Severn, as well as one of the largest industrial towns in Somerset, although in decline in importance thanks to the railways – to join the B&amp;ER at either the county town of Taunton or the large port town of Bridgwater. The promoters had already approached Isambard Kingdom Brunel for his views as the former engineer of the B&amp;ER, and by the time of the meeting he had already undertaken a preliminary survey of the alternative routes. There were three alternate options:

*The Rev. J. Llewellyn, of Wiveliscombe, suggested a route leaving the existing WSMR at Washford, then passing through Monksilver, Elworthy, Brompton Regis, Ford, Milverton and Hillfarrance, and onwards to the B&amp;ER.
*The second and third options bypassed the WSMR, running directly from Watchet to Williton to follow the Donniford valley to Crowcombe, and then either:
**To Triscombe and via a tunnel through the Quantock Hills to Bridgewater. The promoters were initially keen to build the tunnel, as the Ironstone in this part of Somerset was similar to that found in South Wales, amongst which were found rich seams of coal
**Or directly onwards to Taunton, and via the B&amp;ER to Bridgwater

In his contribution, Brunel described the valley of &quot;a little brook called Donniford Brook&quot; as being of prime importance to any route. He had concluded that the starting point should be either Watchet or Porlock, then direct to Williton to follow the Donniford Brook as far as Triscombe. Brunel then gave the initial calculations on the required tunnel to reach Bridgwater, which being 70 to 80 chains in length would require 50 shafts to be sunk, and as it also required approaches with a 1 in 50 gradient, would be very expensive. In his conclusion, Brunel stated his preference as a route from Watchet via Williton to Taunton, stating it to be both cheaper and offering more development options to increase passenger loading.

The first meeting had been dominated by people from Minehead, Wiveliscombe and Bridgwater but, on 1 August 1856, a second meeting was held in Taunton. Brunel explained to those present the advantages of the different routes and gave some weight to the argument for a route to Bridgwater with a long tunnel under the Quantocks. He also suggested that the line should be continued to Minehead or Porlock but the meeting resolved to construct a railway only from Taunton to Watchet.
Brunel was engaged to undertake a more detailed survey and the B&amp;ER agreed to operate the line for ten years in return for 45% of the receipts. Plans were produced as required by British law in November 1856 and the West Somerset Railway Company was incorporated on 17 August 1857 by the (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. cxlv) to build a railway from Taunton to Watchet. A prospectus was issued to raise the required £120,000 and these were all subscribed by the end of the year.

The railway&#x27;s engineer, George Furness of London, started construction on 7 April 1859 at Crowcombe and construction lasted for nearly three years. The railway opened for passengers from Watchet Junction ( west of Taunton) to on 31 March 1862; goods traffic commenced in August. Trains were operated through to Taunton railway station as no station was provided at the junction. On 8 June 1871 a second junction was brought into use where the WSR joined the B&amp;ER main line for the Devon and Somerset Railway and a station was finally opened here, known as , on 8 June 1871 but branch line trains continued to operate through to Taunton.

===Minehead Railway===
The West Somerset Mineral Railway (WSMR) was intended to link the iron-ore mines of the Brendon Hills with the harbour at Watchet. In 1856, before it was even opened, it was suggested that the WSMR should be extended to Minehead instead of the WSR and an act of Parliament for this work was passed on 27 July 1857 but it was never constructed. Instead, the &#x27; (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cccxvii) was passed on 5 July 1865 for a new company to build a line from the WSR at Watchet to Minehead. This again failed to be built but a renewed &#x27; (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. xcvi) of 29 June 1871 finally saw the construction begin the following year.

The new railway was opened on 16 July 1874. In 1871, the WSR had agreed a new perpetual lease to the B&amp;ER for a fixed sum each year which rose annually to a maximum of £6,600. The new Minehead Railway too was leased to the B&amp;ER which then operated the two railways as a single branch from Taunton. To break up the of single track, a passing loop and second platform were installed at Williton, from the junction.

===Part of the Great Western===
On 1 January 1876, the B&amp;ER was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR). To increase the capacity of the West Somerset line, another loop was opened in 1879 at . The broad gauge was converted to standard gauge in 1882. Trains ran as usual on Saturday 28 October but the track was lifted the following day and reopened for traffic on Monday afternoon.

The Minehead Railway was amalgamated into the GWR in 1897 but the West Somerset Railway remained an independent company for the time being although all its assets continued to be leased to the bigger company. Under Great Western influence, there were steady improvements in the line as it carried an increasing level of holiday traffic to the Somerset coast and Exmoor. The platform at Stogumber was extended in 1900, a new passing loop was opened in 1904 at and, the following year, a second platform was opened at Minehead. A third loop was installed in 1906, this time at and the loop at Williton was lengthened in 1907.

Under the Railways Act 1921, the West Somerset Railway Company was finally amalgamated into the Great Western Railway but the Minehead branch, as the route was now known, continued to be operated by the newly enlarged GWR.

In the 1930s, alterations were made to significantly increase the number and length of trains that could be handled. The mainline from Norton Fitzwarren through Taunton to Cogload Junction was increased from two to four tracks on 2 December 1931 and the junction station was enlarged which meant that it was better able to cope with the trains on all three routes. In 1933, the platform at was extended to accommodate longer trains and two further passing loops were opened. These were at Leigh Bridge south of Stogumber and at Kentford west of Watchet. The following year saw the original single track doubled between and Minehead and the platform at the terminus was lengthened. The loop at Blue Anchor was also lengthened in 1934, the line was doubled from Norton Fitzwarren to Bishops Lydeard in 1936 and the Williton loop was lengthened for a second time in 1937. Camp coaches were placed at Blue Anchor from 1934 to 1939 and at Stogumber from 1935 to 1939, which encouraged holiday makers to use the train to reach these rural locations. In 1936, the GWR&#x27;s chairman, Sir Robert Horne, opened the new £20,000 open-air swimming pool at Minehead.

===Run down to closure===
The GWR was nationalised, becoming the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. Camp coaches made a reappearance in 1952 and were available to the public at both Stogumber and Blue Anchor from 1952 to 1964; the latter were kept on for British Rail staff holidays until 1970.

However, Washford signal box was closed in 1952 and Minehead engine shed was closed in 1956. Norton Fitzwarren station closed on 30 October 1961, after which passengers once again had to travel through to Taunton to change onto trains travelling west.

Despite the opening of a Butlins holiday camp at Minehead in 1962 which brought some 30,000 people to the town that year, the line was recommended for closure in the 1963 &quot;Reshaping of British Railways&quot; report. Goods traffic was withdrawn from Stogumber on 17 August 1963 and from the other stations on 6 July 1964 after which British Rail transported any goods traffic by road from Taunton. By this time the passing loops at Leigh Bridge and Kentford had been taken out of use, in April and May 1964 respectively.

The Beatles visited the branch on 2 March 1964 to film part of A Hard Day&#x27;s Night. They shot a short scene at in which Ringo Starr and George Harrison cycle on the platform alongside the train. The train originated at London Paddington and eventually arrived at Minehead where a large crowd of admirers gathered to see the Fab Four.

Minehead signal box was closed on 27 March 1966 after which the two tracks between there and Dunster were operated as two bi-directional single lines, one to each platform. Dunster Signal Box was retained to control the level crossing and points there, and ground frames allowed the train crew to change the points at Minehead to allow locomotives to run round from one end of the train to the other. The original turntable was removed from Minehead in 1967 by which time all trains were operated by diesels.

With the line still proposed for closure, the Transport Users Consultative Committee heard from the Western National bus company that it would require twenty buses in the summer to cope with the influx of holidaymakers, but that most would be idle for much of the year when far fewer people travelled to Minehead and the surrounding district. In an attempt to make the loss-making line profitable, BR reduced the double track from Norton Fitzwarren to one track on 1 March 1970 and closed the signal boxes at Bishops Lydeard and Norton Fitzwarren. This left the branch with three sections (Silk Mills to Williton; Williton to Dunster; Dunster to Minehead) but still required seven staff per shift as there were three signal boxes and four level crossings. The line continued to make a loss so was eventually closed. The last train left Minehead on 2 January 1971; this was a Saturday and the following Monday 4 an enhanced bus service came into operation.

===Closure===
Over the following five-year period, the line was kept in &quot;possible to return to operations&quot; status, but lineside shrubbery quickly took over the infrastructure. In 1975, after Butlins Minehead holiday camp decided to modernise and refurbish, it was proposed to extract LMS Princess Coronation Class 6229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot;, purchased by Billy Butlin in 1966 along with LB&amp;SCR A1 class &quot;Knowle&quot; (transported out by road), under an offer made by British Railways. This required a full-time two-week incursion of a permanent way team to clear the line pathway, before BR Class 25 diesel No.25 059 and a BR brakevan could make a traverse in March 1975. The trackwork of the run round loop of No.1 platform was removed from the upline at , to allow transporter Pickfords to make a suitable railhead connection to enable release of No.6229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot;.

===Heritage railway===

On 5 February 1971, a Minehead Railway Preservation Society organised a meeting in Taunton and a working party headed by Douglas Fear, a local businessman, was tasked with investigating how the line could be reopened as a privately owned railway. In May, a new West Somerset Railway Company was formed to acquire the line and operate a year-round commuter service from Minehead to Taunton alongside which a limited summer steam service could also run. A deal was agreed with British Rail to purchase the line with the support of Somerset County Council, however the council was wary of the lucrative Minehead station site falling into private hands should the railway fail. Instead, it purchased the line itself in 1973 and leased back the operational land to the West Somerset Railway Company plc.

The proposed commuter service never materialised, due to traffic restrictions between the newly installed Taunton Cider Company sidings at and Taunton, but the line was slowly reopened as a heritage railway. Minehead to Blue Anchor was the first section to see trains restored, opening on 28 March 1976 and services were extended to Williton on 28 August the same year. Trains returned to Stogumber on 7 May 1978 and they reached Bishops Lydeard on 9 June 1979. A new station at was opened on the coast east of Watchet on 27 June 1987 to serve a holiday camp at Helwell Bay.

In 2004, work started on constructing a new triangle at Norton Fitzwarren which included a part of the old Devon and Somerset line, and a ballast reclamation depot opened there in 2006. In 2008, a new turntable was brought into use at Minehead. A new station opened on 1 August 2009 at Norton Fitzwarren on a new site a short distance north of the main line.

During 2007 a regular service ran from Minehead to Taunton and on a couple of days each week. Known as the &quot;Minehead Express&quot;, it was aimed at holidaymakers travelling to Butlins at Minehead. It left Minehead at 11:10 and Bristol at 14:06 with Victa Westlink&#x27;s s 31452 and 31454 powering the five coaches. 31128 was available as a spare locomotive but was not used on the service trains. The first of these trains ran on 20 July and operated on a total of 18 days, finishing on 27 August.

Whilst the freehold of the line continues to be owned by Somerset County Council, during 2013 it was announced that both the WSRA and the WSR plc had approached the county council about the possibility of purchasing the freehold of the line. The council made the decision in late May 2014 not to sell the freehold after all.

A May 2018 county transport strategy acknowledged that there were plans to reintroduce services between Taunton and Minehead. Following an inspection by the Office of Rail and Road in 2018, it was announced that the railway would close from 2 January 2019, and would reopen on 1 April. The inspection found that several safety improvements needed to be made.

The line was suggested in 2019 by Campaign for a Better Transport as a &#x27;priority 2&#x27; candidate for reopening as part of the national network.

==Route==
The route is described from Minehead towards Taunton. Features are described as being on the left or right of the line for passengers facing this direction of travel, therefore the right side of the train is generally on the south or west of the line. On the railway this is known as the &#x27;up&#x27; direction.

===Minehead to Watchet===
&quot;Communities served: Minehead – Dunster – Carhampton and Blue Anchor – Washford – Watchet &quot;

The station at is situated on the sea front close to the town centre. The platform has a track on each side and the old goods shed, which is now used for locomotive maintenance, is situated on the north side between the platform and the beach. On the opposite side of the station is a turntable and the station cafe. Sidings on both sides of the station are used to hold stock, both operating vehicles and others awaiting repairs in the workshops. At the far end of the station is the signal box and level crossing over Seaward Way, a link road from the A39 to the seafront that was built in the 1990s.

Trains leave Minehead heading south-eastwards on the longest straight and level section of track along the whole line, passing behind Butlin&#x27;s holiday camp which is on the left between the railway and the sea and then across flat fields. from Minehead the line crosses Dunster West level crossing and enters station. It is a mile from the village of that name which is on the hill to the right along with Dunster Castle.

The platform at Dunster is on the right while the old goods yard on the left is now used by the WSR&#x27;s civil engineering team who keep the tracks in good order. On leaving the station is another level crossing, this time over Sea Lane that leads down to Dunster Beach which can be glimpsed to the left of the train. A footpath leads from the east end of the platform down to Sea Lane to save a long walk round along the road. The line then continues across the concrete channel of the River Avill onto Ker Moor and along the edge of the beach to reach , from Minehead and the first passing loop. Approaching the station, the old goods yard is on the right and three camp coaches are kept here where volunteers working on the railway can stay overnight. At the western end of the platform, a signal box overlooks a level crossing on the road from Blue Anchor to Carhampton. The West Somerset Steam Railway Trust&#x27;s museum is on the right-hand platform.

The line now leaves the sea and swings inland in a south east direction, climbing at gradients up to 1 in 65 (1.5%), the steepest section of the line. After turning back towards the north east, the line reaches the second highest point on the line at . This is from Minehead and has a single platform on the right. On the opposite side of the line, the goods yard and shed is now used by the West Somerset Railway Heritage Trust for restoration of their heritage carriages, following the vacating of the site by the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust, who had occupied the site 1976–2023 and ran a museum there with a collection of rolling stock and a display of signalling equipment.

The line now swings north-eastwards and starts to descend, initially at 1 in 74 (1.35%). A footpath on the right of the line at a slightly lower level is the route of the old West Somerset Mineral Railway, which passes beneath the line on the approach to Watchet. After passing the former junction to the Wansbrough Paper Mill on the right, the line passes under a small road bridge, before arriving at Watchet railway station, from Minehead.

===Watchet to Bishops Lydeard===
&quot;Communities served: Watchet – Williton – Stogumber and Kingswood – Crowcombe – Bishops Lydeard &quot;

The platform at Watchet is on the right of the train but the station building is unusually set back from the line and faces Taunton, a hangover from its construction as the terminus of the original West Somerset Railway. The old goods shed is opposite the platform and now houses the Watchet Boat Museum. A footbridge crosses the line at the Minehead end of the station and a foot crossing leads across the track at the other end of the platform which gives access to the harbour for train passengers.

The line climbs away into a cutting through a headland but soon swings round to a south-easterly direction along the cliff above Helwell Bay. Passing under the Watchet to West Quantoxhead road, the line turns southwards and passes the concrete platform at , which is on the left of the train from Minehead. The agricultural landscape is then soon supplanted on the right by the sidings around the West Somerset Railway Association&#x27;s (WSRA) workshops, which are housed in a corrugated iron building known as the Swindon Shed as it was originally built there more than 100 years ago. Watchet is being used as the terminus of trains from Bishops Lydeard in March and April 2019 due to engineering works at Minehead.

Williton railway station, at , is near the midpoint of the operational railway and the second passing loop. Behind the platform on the right, next to the WSRA workshops, are the old goods shed and the more modern workshop which is the home to the Diesel and Electric Preservation Group&#x27;s fleet of diesel locomotives. The main station building is also on this platform, as is the oldest signal box on the line which stands above the level crossing. This sees little road traffic as most crosses the railway on the A39 road bridge that stands just beyond the end of the passing loop. Next to the level crossing on the left of the line is a garden with a decorative box hedge that is over 100 years old.

Leaving Williton, the railway crosses over the A358 road and climbs up onto the side of the Quantock Hills. Passing close to the village of Bicknoller, it crosses the Macmillan Way West, a long-distance footpath. Following the eastern side of a steep valley, it continues to rise with sections at 1 in 100 and 1 in 92 (1.1%) as it approaches the small station at , from Minehead. This station unusually has its platform on the right of the train but the station offices are on the left. The space alongside the offices is now a well-maintained garden but is where the goods shed used to stand.

The line continues to climb 1 in 92 up the valley until, from Minehead, it reaches the summit of the line at . This is another passing loop but the down platform (on the right) is signalled to allow trains to run in either direction; the original platform was on the left of the line and so the main buildings are all on this side of the line. From the Minehead end, they include the old station master&#x27;s house, some modern housing in sympathetic style and the station offices.

After leaving Crowcombe Heathfield, it is downhill, with sections as steep as 1 in 81 (1.2%). At Combe Florey, the line crosses the A358 two more times in quick succession and this remains close on the left of the line to . This station has another passing loop and is the terminus of regular operations, from Minehead. Locomotives are kept in a secure compound on the left at the Taunton end of the station. Both platforms are signalled for running in either direction and most trains run from the one on the left, although the original buildings are all on the right. These include the goods shed which now houses a railway museum and the old station master&#x27;s house.

===Bishops Lydeard to Taunton===
&quot;Communities served: Bishops Lydeard – Norton Fitzwarren – Taunton &quot;

This section beyond Bishops Lydeard carries no regularly scheduled passenger trains nowadays but occasional special services operate. During special events, a shuttle service is often operated between Bishops Lydeard and the new platform that opened at Norton Fitzwarren in 2009. A few special trains also operate over the link between the West Somerset Railway and Network Rail, running through to Taunton and beyond.

The line passes the Norton Manor Royal Marine camp on the left and then passes under Norton Bridge and the new Allerford Junction where a siding has been installed on the right to serve the West Somerset Railway Association&#x27;s ballast reclamation depot. Just beyond the junction, on the right, is the concrete platform erected in 2009 at . The West Somerset Railway&#x27;s line terminates here and trains running through to Taunton run onto Network Rail&#x27;s tracks. The remains of the station hotel are seen on the left but the track joins the Bristol to Exeter line on the right. Passing the engineers&#x27; depot at Fairwater Yard on the right, one soon arrives at , the traditional junction station for trains running the to Minehead.

===Norton Fitzwarren triangle===

On 24 March 2004, the WSRA announced the purchase of of land at Norton Fitzwarren. The triangular piece of land is located between: the existing WSR line from Norton Bridge (B3227) south to the junction with Network Rail; the westward running residual trackbed of the Barnstaple branch from Network Rail junction to the first bridge (Allerford Bridge) over the former trackbed in the west; and the Barnstaple branch stub back north to Norton Bridge. The purchase of the land was announced as the first step in a 20-year programme to create a new train turning facility, alongside a national-scale &quot;Heritage Railway Development&quot; encompassing: an engine shed; carriage works; and railway engineering facility.

In 2009, just beyond the new Allerford Junction, the WSR constructed a new 4-carriage length station on the original WSR/Network Rail line, creating a new station on WSR metals, just west of the original GWR location.

Network Rail&#x27;s (NR) Fairwater Yard track maintenance facility is a short distance east of Norton Fitzwarren. Due to the high costs of ballast disposal from the site, NR approached the railway about using the triangle site as a commercial recycling site, allowing reclaimed ballast to be used in the local construction industry. After gaining planning permission from Somerset County Council, and approval of a drainage plan from the Environment Agency (conditions of which stipulate that the site must be fully reverted to meadow pasture at the termination of ballast recycling operations) the WSRA came to an agreement with NR to utilise spent ballast and rail from their track renewals programme. NR maintenance trains occasionally run from Fairwater Yard to Norton Fitzwarren to drop off spent materials at the site. A commercial operator sorts the ballast under contract to the WSRA.

The funds generated from ballast recycling allowed the WSRA to develop the triangle as originally proposed and an inner chord to create sufficient space in which to safely turn trains before the junction with the main line. Visiting BR Standard Class 7 70000 &quot;Britannia&quot; was the first locomotive to officially be turned on the Norton Fitzwarren triangle during the Spring Steam Gala in March 2012.

==Operation==
A service of four trains each way Monday to Saturday was advertised when the railway first opened to Watchet, but this fluctuated to five or six at times for many years. A very limited Sunday service was introduced in 1862 but was withdrawn in 1869.

An engine shed was provided at originally Watchet so that trains could start from that end of the line. This was moved to Minehead when the line was extended to there, but the frequency of services remained much the same. With the improvements to the line in the early years of the century, the frequency increased to eight trains daily by 1910 and to 14 before World War II. Sunday services resumed in 1926 for the first time in over 50 years. The engine shed was closed in 1956 after which time all trains were provided from the Taunton end and the timetable was cut back to ten round trips. Diesels started to appear regularly from 1962, both locomotive-hauled trains and diesel multiple units (DMUs).

As of 2009, regular services operate between Minehead and Bishops Lydeard. The operating season runs from March to October, with infrequent operations from November through to February. Trains run daily during the summer but less frequently during the remainder of the season. Four regular timetables are run on different days depending on expected demand, varying from two to four trains in operation, each of which makes two round trips which gives between four and eight services each way. From February 2009 to January 2010, services were advertised on 243 days. Operating locomotives are based at Minehead and Bishops Lydeard and a spare is generally kept ready at Williton.

During special events, an intensive service is operated and some workings continue through to Norton Fitzwarren. A few railtours each year come through from Network Rail using the connection near Taunton.

The heritage railway also carries some freight traffic from time to time. At one time this was carrying stone for Minehead sea defences, in conjunction with Mendip Rail. In more recent years it has seen Freightliner-hauled Network Rail trains discharge old ballast at Norton Fitzwarren for recycling.

===Signalling===
The railway is separated into five nominal block sections:
*Network Rail boundary at Norton Fitzwarren (milepost 1651/4) to Bishops Lydeard: One Train Working (OTW). A &quot;No Signalman&quot; Electric Key Token (EKT) system is used on this section. The token is sent by car to when through trains operate from Network Rail. There are no intermediate loops, but three ground frame operated points to allow access and turning on the Norton Triangle.
*Bishops Lydeard to Crowcombe Heathfield: both stations have passing loops controlled by signal boxes. This section is controlled by an EKT system, as is the rest of the line. Crowcombe Heathfield signal box can be switched-out, creating a double section with the next block, with control then via a long section EKT system.
*Crowcombe Heathfield to Williton: both stations have passing loops controlled by signal boxes, with the block controlled by EKT.
*Williton to Blue Anchor: both stations have passing loops controlled by signal boxes, with the block controlled by EKT.
*Blue Anchor to Minehead: both stations have loops or facilities controlled by signal boxes. This section uses Electric Key Token (EKT) control and was the first section to be completed with working EKT.

Communication between signal boxes for block working is by a block bell system with a series of bell codes, with additional phone lines for more in depth conversation to take place.

The signal boxes use two types of frame, both manufactured at the GWR signal works in . The older frames are the 1892 developed Stud frame, which replaced the original twist frames. It operates in a similar manner to tappet locking except that the blades are curved. The remained signal boxes use 5-bar tappet locking frames dating from the 1930s. Power supply within the boxes is standard 110-volt AC, 50 Hz, derived via transformer from the standard UK/EU 230-volts AC individual supplies. Inside the box, most voltages are DC, with standards derived from those in operations during British Railways ownership of the line.

Isolated level crossings are fed direct from mains supply, but use a locally derived railway standard 24-volts DC.

&quot;Switching Out&quot; Crowcombe Heathfield

Crowcombe Heathfield Signal Box can be &quot;switched out&quot;. When done, this reduces the amount of block sections on the railway to 4. Switching out is a procedure conducted by the signallers at Bishops Lydeard, Crowcombe Heathfield and Williton. Once complete, bell codes are transmitted between Bishops Lydeard and Williton using separate block bell instruments in their respective signalboxes for the long section, and thus a different, long section token is used for the full line between Bishops Lydeard and Williton. No signalman is required at Crowcombe Heathfield when the box is switched out. 

When switched out, the points are set and locked for the main platform (Down Platform) and all signals for said platform are cleared in both directions, transforming Crowcombe Heathfield into a single platform station. The route and signals cannot be changed until the box is switched back in.

===Rolling stock===
Photographs of the line when operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway show that their 4-4-0ST locomotives were the regular motive power. Later years saw types such as GWR 4500, 4575, and 5101 &#x27;prairie&#x27; 2-6-2Ts, 2251 &#x27;Collett goods&#x27; 0-6-0s, 5700 &#x27;pannier tank&#x27; 0-6-0PTs and 4300 &#x27;mogul&#x27; 2-6-0s. In British Railways&#x27; time, these were replaced by Western Region NBL Type 2, &quot;Hymek&quot; Type 3 diesel-hydraulic locomotives, Swindon and Gloucester cross-country diesel multiple units (DMUs).

Today, the line is operated by a variety of preserved steam and diesel locomotives and DMUs. Most of these are typical of GWR branch lines in Somerset or of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (SDJR). Among the types based on the railway are examples of GWR 4575 and 5100 class 2-6-2Ts and a Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway 7F Class 2-8-0. A unique experiment has been to convert a GWR 5101 Class 2-6-2T into a small 2-6-0 numbered 9351. Diesels include &quot;Hymek&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; diesel-hydraulics.

Most trains are formed from British Rail Mark 1 coaches painted in a chocolate and cream livery, based on the most familiar one used by the GWR but with WSR crests. The WSRA owned and operated &quot;Quantock Belle&quot; fine dining train is also formed from BR Mark 1 coaches, but each is painted in a livery reminiscent of Pullman cars and also named. There are also a number of freight wagons, some of which are used for engineering purposes or in a demonstration heritage freight train that is used on special occasions.

==Films and television==
Several films and television programmes have been shot on the railway:
* &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) featured The Beatles and was filmed in 1964 at London Marylebone station and on the Minehead branch, much of it in and around Crowcombe.
*&quot;The Belstone Fox&quot; (1973), a children&#x27;s film, partly shot along the line near Crowcombe (village), chronicling the life of a fox much smarter than the dogs that hunt him.
* &quot;The Flockton Flyer&quot; (1977–78) was a children&#x27;s television drama series about a preserved railway that was filmed on the West Somerset Railway shortly after it reopened.
* &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1988), a BBC television mini-series was filmed at Crowcombe Heathfield.
* &quot;The Land Girls&quot; (1997) was filmed on the railway and Crowcombe Heathfield featured as Bamford station.
*&quot;Casualty&quot; (2013) the BBC One medical-based soap opera has used the line since shooting its first scenes in December 2013.

==Heritage organisations ==
Although the railway is operated by the West Somerset Railway Company (WSR plc) based at Minehead, it is supported by a number of voluntary and charitable organisations.

The West Somerset Railway Association (WSRA) was formed alongside the WSR plc in 1971, to reopen the line. Based at Bishops Lydeard, it is a major shareholder of the plc. It has workshops at Williton and owns two locomotives (4500 Class 4561 and Manor Class No.7821 &quot;Ditcheat Manor&quot;) and shares in others. It also owns the &quot;Quantock Belle&quot; dining train and &quot;Hawksworth Saloon&quot; which operate on the line.

The West Somerset Railway Heritage Trust (WSRHT) (until 2021 named the West Somerset Steam Railway Trust) was set up in 1972 to operate the summer steam trains alongside the West Somerset Railway plc&#x27;s commuter service. It had little to do once the railway became a purely seasonal heritage line but, in 1984 to coincide with the GW150 celebrations, was revived for education and historical research into the Minehead branch, and now has a small museum at Blue Anchor. The Trust&#x27;s restored GWR sleeping carriage is on display in the Gauge Museum at Bishops Lydeard, and the Trust is presently restoring a GWR &#x27;Toplight&#x27; coach which will be the first in a set of historic coaches on the West Somerset Railway. The Trust is administered by five voluntary directors. In early 2007, the Trust embarked on a project to restore two rakes of GWR coaches for use on the West Somerset Railway. Some of these were already on the railway, but others will be brought from abroad. The first of these, No 6705, was acquired from Steamtown USA. It returned to England, and after initial works at Crewe, is now at Williton for completion.

The Diesel and Electric Preservation Group (DEPG) is based at Williton, where they use the old goods shed and a newer building as workshops for their fleet of five ex-Western Region diesel locomotives: Class 14 9526; Class 35s 7017 and 7018; Class 47 1661; and Class 52 1010. Williton is also the base for a number of privately owned locomotives which are maintained by the DEPG.

===Former===
The Somerset and Dorset Railway Trust (S&amp;DRT) was formerly based at , and promotes the education and preservation of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It owns S&amp;DJR 7F 2-8-0 number 88, which was part of the WSR&#x27;s regular operational fleet during their tenure. While Washford was under their custodianship, the Trust developed a workshop and yard, where they restored a number of former S&amp;DJR goods wagons and coaches, as well as &quot;Kilmersdon&quot;, a Peckett 0-4-0ST locomotive. The associated museum featured a signalling display based around the small signal box from . In 2020 the Trust&#x27;s agreement with the WSR was terminated and slowly the Trust&#x27;s collection has been relocated to various sites including the Watercress Line and the Avon Valley Railway.

<text>Room acoustics is a subfield of acoustics dealing with the behaviour of sound in enclosed or partially-enclosed spaces. The architectural details of a room influences the behaviour of sound waves within it, with the effects varying by frequency. Acoustic reflection, diffraction, and diffusion can combine to create audible phenomena such as room modes and standing waves at specific frequencies and locations, echos, and unique reverberation patterns.

==Frequency zones==

The way that sound behaves in a room can be broken up into four different frequency zones:
* The first zone is below the frequency that has a wavelength of twice the longest length of the room. In this zone, sound behaves very much like changes in static air pressure.
* Above that zone, until wavelengths are comparable to the dimensions of the room,&lt;/math&gt; Hz when room volume, V, is measured in cubic metres, and reverberation time, RT60, is measured in seconds; this formula incorporates the approximate speed of sound in air.}} room resonances dominate. This transition frequency is popularly known as the Schroeder frequency, or the cross-over frequency, and it differentiates the low frequencies which create standing waves within small rooms from the mid and high frequencies.
* The third region which extends approximately 2 octaves is a transition to the fourth zone.
* In the fourth zone, sounds behave like rays of light bouncing around the room.

==Natural modes==

For frequencies under the Schroeder frequency, certain wavelengths of sound will build up as resonances within the boundaries of the room, and the resonating frequencies can be determined using the room&#x27;s dimensions. Similar to the calculation of standing waves inside a pipe with two closed ends, the modal frequencies formula_1 and the sound pressure of those modes at a particular position formula_2 of a rectilinear room can be defined as 

formula_3 
formula_4

where formula_5 are mode numbers corresponding to the x-,y-, and z-axis of the room, formula_6 is the speed of sound in formula_7, formula_8 are the dimensions of the room in meters. formula_9 is the amplitude of the sound wave, and formula_10 are coordinates of a point contained inside the room. 

Modes can occur in all three dimensions of a room. Axial modes are one-dimensional, and build up between one set of parallel walls. Tangential modes are two-dimensional, and involve four walls bounding the space perpendicular to each other. Finally, oblique modes concern all walls within the simplified rectilinear room.

A modal density analysis method using concepts from psychoacoustics, the &quot;Bonello criterion&quot;, analyzes the first 48 room modes and plots the number of modes in each one-third of an octave. The curve increases monotonically (each one-third of an octave must have more modes than the preceding one). Other systems to determine correct room ratios have more recently been developed.

==Reverberation of the room==
After determining the best dimensions of the room, using the modal density criteria, the next step is to find the correct reverberation time. The most appropriate reverberation time depends on the use of the room. RT60 is a measure of reverberation time. Times about 1.5 to 2 seconds are needed for opera theaters and concert halls. For broadcasting and recording studios and conference rooms, values under one second are frequently used. The recommended reverberation time is always a function of the volume of the room. Several authors give their recommendations A good approximation for broadcasting studios and conference rooms is:
:TR[1 kHz] = [0.4 log (V+62)] – 0.38 seconds, 
with V=volume of the room in m3. Ideally, the RT60 should have about the same value at all frequencies from 30 to 12,000 Hz. 

To get the desired RT60, several acoustics materials can be used as described in several books. A valuable simplification of the task was proposed by Oscar Bonello in 1979. It consists of using standard acoustic panels of 1 m2 hung from the walls of the room (only if the panels are parallel). These panels use a combination of three Helmholtz resonators and a wooden resonant panel. This system gives a large acoustic absorption at low frequencies (under 500 Hz) and reduces at high frequencies to compensate for the typical absorption by people, lateral surfaces, ceilings, etc.

Acoustic space is an acoustic environment in which sound can be heard by an observer. The term &quot;acoustic space&quot; was first mentioned by Marshall McLuhan, a professor and a philosopher.

== Nature of acoustics ==
In reality, there are some properties of acoustics that affect the acoustic space. These properties can either improve the quality of the sound or interfere with the sound.
* Reflection is the change in direction of a wave when it hits an object. Many acoustic engineers took advantage from this. It is used for interior designs, either use reflections for benefits or eliminates the reflections. The sound waves usually reflect off the wall and interfere with other sound waves that are generated later. To prevent sound waves reflecting directly to the receiver, a diffusor is introduced. A diffusor has different depths in it, causing the sound to scatter in random directions evenly. It changes the disturbing echo of the sound into a mild reverb which decays over time.
* Diffraction is the change of a sound wave&#x27;s propagation to avoid obstacles. According to Huygens’ principle, when a sound wave is partially blocked by an obstacle, the remaining part that gets through acts as a source of secondary waves. For instance, if a person is in a room and shouts with the door open, the people on either side of the hallway will hear it. The sound waves that left the door become a source then spread out in the hallway. The sounds from the surroundings might interfere with the acoustic space like the example given.

== Uses of acoustic space ==
The application of acoustic space is very useful in architecture. Some kinds of architecture need a proficient design to bring out the best performances. For example, concert halls, auditoriums, theaters, or even cathedrals.
* Concert Hall – a place that is designed to hold a concert. A good concert hall usually holds around 1700 to 2600 audience. There are three main attributes of a good concert halls: clarity, ambiance, and loudness. If the seats are well positioned, the audience will hear clear sound from every single seat. For more ambiance, reverberation times are designed as preferred. For instance, romantic music usually requires an amount of reverberation time to enhance the emotions, therefore, the ceilings of the concert hall should be high. 
* Theater – a place that is designed for live performances. The first priority for sound design in a theater is speech. Speech has to be heard clearly, even if it is a soft whisper. The reverb is not needed in this case, it interrupts the words spoken by the actors. The intensity has to be increased, in order to enlarge the acoustic space, to cover the theater without disrupting the dynamic. In large theaters, amplification must be used. 
* Cathedral (and church) have an area called a choir, usually located near the transept, where the tower is located in most cathedrals. The choir is for the choir to sing. This kind of singing needs a soft cloudy sound for ambiance and emotion. The height of the cathedral does not only show religious pride but also improves the acoustics. There is more reverb when the source generates a sound in the space

<doc id="248608" wikidata="Q237371" url="?curid=248608" title="Rie Tanaka">
<text>is a Japanese voice actress and singer. Notable among her numerous roles in anime are Lacus Clyne in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny&quot;, Chi in &quot;Chobits&quot;, Hikari Kujou/Shiny Luminous in &quot;Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart&quot;, Minna-Dietlinde Wilcke in &quot;Strike Witches&quot; and Suigintou in the anime adaptation of &quot;Rozen Maiden&quot;. In video games, she provides the voice of title character Neptune in the &quot;Hyperdimension Neptunia&quot; franchise, Morrigan Aensland in &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; and &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, Sesshoin Kiara in &quot;Fate/Extra&quot; and &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, Murata Himeko in &quot;Honkai Impact 3rd and Himeko in &quot;, Mitsuru Kirijo in &quot;Persona 3&quot;, Lisa in &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; and Ciel in &quot;Megaman Zero&quot;.

==Biography==
When Tanaka was in elementary school, she was a member of the book club. She loved to read to others, and would give picture story shows to the younger students in the morning before the homeroom teacher came to the classroom. One of the activities of the book committee was to hold a picture-story show competition in the audio-visual room, and when the students saw her picture-story show, they were delighted. She loved reading and illustrations to begin with, especially those of Mutsumi Inomata, and her desire to become a voice actress was directly triggered when she bought and listened to the drama CD &quot;CD Theater Dragon Quest&quot;, whose jacket illustration was done by Inomata, at a bookstore.

When she was in high school, she was a member of the Manga Research Club and participated in the Manga Nationals, where she directly appealed to Kazuhiko Shimamoto, a judge from her hometown, that she wanted to be a voice actor. After graduating from high school, she moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the voice acting course at Yoyogi Animation Academy. As she was very fond of reading and taking care of children, becoming a nursery teacher was also a big dream of hers. She was torn between going on to higher education and becoming a nursery teacher or becoming a voice actor, but she chose the latter because she wanted to bring her voice to children in a larger world, not stopping at one world. While still in school, Tanaka won the grand prize at the vocal audition held by MediaWorks &amp; Scitron Digital Contents. She made her debut in the entertainment industry when she sang the opening theme song for the PlayStation version of &quot;Eien no Shin&#x27;yū&quot; in &quot;Yūkyū Gensōkyoku 2nd Album&quot;. This is why her debut as a singer was earlier than her debut as a voice actor. At the same time, she also participated in the theatrical anime &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Motion Picture&quot; as a minor role. She made her debut as an agency voice actress in 1999, playing the role of Mitsuki Sanada, one of the heroines in &quot;Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure&quot;. 2006 saw her first starring role as Hiroko Matsukata in &quot;Hataraki Man&quot;.

Due to management reasons, Tanaka moved from Dramatic Department, to which she had belonged for many years, to Retreat on April 1, 2008, and to Office Anemone on March 1, 2019.

In addition to voice acting, Tanaka is also active in music, singing character songs for some works, and sometimes releasing singles under her own name. On April 26, 2019, it was announced that she will be working as a Youtuber under the show name &quot;Rie Tanaka TV.&quot;

==Personal life==
Tanaka&#x27;s favorite phrase is &quot;Never get discouraged, never run away, never give up,&quot; and she has been actively increasing her Twitter friends since around 2010, including Rina Satō and Kenjiro Hata. However, on June 23, 2013, a man with a knife intruded a &quot;Neptunia&quot; promotion where Tanaka was present, yelling &quot;Give me Tanaka! I am the victim!&quot;. In the hustle, Tanaka fell and bruised her knee, and after the incident, she took a break from Twitter and later returned in 2014.

On June 17, 2012, Tanaka announced on her blog that she had married voice actor Koichi Yamadera. A year later, she disbanded her official fan club, &quot;Cafe de Rie.&quot; She co-starred with Yamadera as Kusuo&#x27;s maternal grandparents in 2016&#x27;s &quot;The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.&quot;. On August 3, 2018, she announced on Twitter that she and Yamadera had divorced in July.

<text>Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense (RMD) was one of four business segments of RTX Corporation. Headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, its president was Wes Kremer. The business produced a broad portfolio of advanced technologies, including air and missile defense systems, precision weapons, radars, and command and control systems. Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space was merged with Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense in July 2023 to form the Raytheon business segment.

==History==
The business was a combination of two Raytheon Company legacy businesses, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) and Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), which operated a plant formerly owned by the Hughes Aircraft Company. 

Raytheon had been criticized for selling arms to Saudi Arabia that were used in the Yemen Civil War. These sales were blocked by the Obama administration in 2016 due to humanitarian concerns, a decision that was reversed by the Trump administration six months later.

On May 22, 2024, the unit was sanctioned by the Chinese government due to arms sales to Taiwan.

==Products==

He sold more than five million copies from his repertoire of 482 songs, which extended from Twang, cabaret, instrumental film music, chansons, country, to folk and vocal music. Born in Boom, Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium, he worked his way up from a working-class environment to become one of the 200 richest people in Belgium.

Schoepen married Dutch former opera singer and photographer&#x27;s model Josephina (Josée) Jongen on 18 May 1961. They have five children: Robert (&quot;Bob Jr.&quot;, 1962), Myriam (1963), Jacky (1964), Peggy (1968), and Tom (1970). His son Tom became his manager in Belgium.

==Early musical period==

Modest Schoepen grew up in a smithy in Boom, Antwerp. His career started in the late 1930s when he and his sister Liesje performed vaudeville shows in the surrounding villages, going around with the hat collecting money afterwards. He had his first audition for radio, in 1944 in Brussels. In 1943 he undertook classical guitar instruction with guitarist Frans De Groodt (1892–1990).

===Musical and political debut===
That same year he had a memorable debut performance in the Ancienne Belgique of Brussels. In front of a full house he sang the South-African song, &quot;Mama, ek wil &#x27;n man hé&quot;. Nee mamma, née, &#x27;n Duitseman, die wil ek nie. Want Schweinefleisch dit lus ek nie&quot; (&quot;Mommy, I want a husband. No mommy no, I don&#x27;t want a German &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t like pig meat.&quot;) The song was perceived as being anti-German, provoking a few Nazis who were present at the show to take him away. The South African song is making reference to a &#x27;German man&#x27;. The Ancienne Belgique was closed for three weeks. Shortly thereafter he was forced to go work in Germany. As an alternative he chose to sing for the Flemish workers doing compulsory labor. For this he was locked up for three months in the Dossin barracks in Mechelen from October 1944, without a hearing or a trial.

===Two Boys and Two Guitars===
In 1945 he formed a duo with Kees Brug, a young man from his own village, with the name of &quot;Two Boys and Two Guitars&quot;. They performed impersonations, poetry, South-African songs, and country music from Calais to Amsterdam, all with plenty of room for improvisation and adventure. The name &quot;Bobbejaan&quot; comes from the South-African song, &quot;Bobbejaan klim die berg&quot; (&quot;Baboon Climbs the Mountain&quot;). Schoepen took it as his artist name in 1945 or 1946.

===Performing to the allied forces===
In 1947 he came into contact with Jacques Kluger. Kluger asked Schoepen to entertain the American and Canadian troops during the Nuremberg Trials, and in Frankfurt and Berlin. Kluger was pleased to receive an unexpected, flattering letter from Major Mearker, and contracted Schoepen to go on tour in Germany for several months. In Berlin, which was still partly in ruins, his floor shows were also attended by the American general and military governor Lucius D. Clay, who asked him for two additional performances. These tours would further stimulate his country music tendencies.
===First hit record and Indonesian tour===
In between these shows, Schoepen also gave occasional performances in his own country. While he initially did not wish to sing in Dutch, Kluger convinced him to record &#x27;a Flemish record&#x27;. Schoepen&#x27;s first recordings followed, and in 1948 &quot;De Jodelende Fluiter&quot; (&quot;The Yodeling Whistler&quot;) became Schoepen&#x27;s first hit. His breakthrough in the Netherlands also happened that year. Among his many performances, he was frequently asked to guest-star in the Netherlands.

Bobbejaan soon became the right man to work for the benefit of the Dutch. In 1949 he went on tour for the Dutch troops in Indonesia, performing 127 shows over the course of three months. He was decorated for courage and self-sacrifice by the Dutch government because he also performed for troops near the front line. Five days after returning home he began a 220-day tour through Belgium, playing nostalgic songs, such as the tried and true &quot;De lichtjes van de Schelde&quot; (&quot;The Lights of the Scheldt&quot;) (1952), which is still an evergreen in Belgium today, Bobbejaan Schoepen quickly became one of the most popular artists in Flanders.

==International tours and success==

Schoepen toured in at least twenty different countries, together with artists such as Josephine Baker, Caterina Valente, Gilbert Bécaud, and Toots Thielemans (who was a guitarist in his band in 1951). He is one of the first Europeans (excluding the British) to have appeared at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, one of the most important centers of country music in the United States. In 1953 he played there three times with Roy Acuff (1903–1992). There was one performance with the country singer Red Foley (1910–1968) in Springfield, Missouri. The American country singer, Tex Williams, a Western swing performer, would later release a cover of Schoepen&#x27;s &quot;Fire and Blisters&quot; in the US (1974).

===1954 tours===
In 1954 there followed a three-month European tour through Germany, Iceland, and Denmark, which concluded with a few months of performances in the Folies Bergère in Paris. Syd Fox was Schoepen&#x27;s manager in Iceland and Denmark. When Jacques Brel performed the opening act in the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels in January 1955, Schoepen already had the status of an international vedette in his own country. He was chosen as the best Flemish singer by the broadcasting company NIR (nowadays VRT), for which he received the &quot;Grand Prize for Flemish Gramophone Recording.&quot;

That autumn he toured with his show for a month through Germany then a month through the Congo.

===1957 tours===
In 1957 he again went to New York, where he was asked to make a guest-appearance on the famous Ed Sullivan Show. He recorded albums at RCA Records with the producer Steve Sholes. Sholes offered him a contract to promote his record, by visiting radio stations in the US for three months, under the name &quot;Bobby John&quot;. This tour was intended to promote his recent releases, and in the meantime he was to produce new songs. But Schoepen, who had already been on tour almost constantly for ten years, and had contractual obligations in Europe, was increasingly looking for a place to settle down (this would become Bobbejaanland). He decided no longer to pursue his success in the US.

That same month he became the last-minute Belgian representative at the second Eurovision Song Contest 1957. He was rushed by his manager Jacques Kluger from the US to Germany in order to take part in the event. This performance was memorable for having featured a whistling solo. Schoepen is also rumoured not to have known which song he was to perform at the Contest until he arrived, only rehearsing his entry a few days before performance. The song that was finally chosen was the lightly poetic &quot;Straatdeuntje&quot; (&#x27;Street Tune&#x27;). Belgium tied for eighth place with the Swiss.

===1958 tours===
A year later in 1958, Kluger secured Schoepen a place in the &quot;Royal Variety Show&quot; in England, a yearly gala for the Queen Mother (Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon). After the show, his local manager Jack Heath let him hear the first golden Australian hit in the US, &quot;A Pub with No Beer&quot; by Slim Dusty, and Schoepen decided to make a Dutch, German, and English cover of it. In 1960, &quot;Ich steh an der Bar und ich habe kein Geld&quot; stayed on the hit lists for thirty weeks in Germany; it also became a number-one hit in Austria. The Flemish version, &quot;Café zonder bier&quot; dates from 1959, and that year it reached @3 in the hit parade. It later became a golden oldie.

===Other hits and tours===
His German versions of &quot;Een hutje op de Heide&quot; (&quot;Little cottage on the Heath&quot;) and &quot;Kili Watch&quot; (originally by The Cousins) also did very well (among other reasons because of the German film, &quot;&quot;, 1961). Schoepen toured frequently in Germany and Austria with Caterina Valente (1955) and Dalida (1961), among others. This earned him many new, interesting contracts. In 1961 he became one of the top musical acts at the Berlin Film Festival, where he brought down the house at the Deutschlandhalle with his crazy whistling acts.

During the 1960s, Camillo Felgen, Heino, and James Last, among others, would catapult his evergreen &quot;Ik heb eerbied voor jouw grijze haren&quot; (&quot;I Respect Your Grey Hair&quot;) into a huge European hit, which has sold more than three million copies. In 1961, Caterina Valente also released a version of &quot;In de schaduw van de mijn&quot; (&quot;In the Shadow of the [Coal] Mine&quot;) in Italy, under the title &quot;Amice Miei&quot;, and in 1965 Richard Anthony sang a French and Spanish version &quot;Ik heb me dikwijls afgevraagd&quot; (&quot;Je me suis souvent demandé&quot;) into the international charts: the song reached #1 in France, April 3, 1965. In 1965 it earned Schoepen, who wrote the music, an artistic &#x27;Diploma of the Croix d&#x27;Honneur&#x27; in Paris.

In 1967, ZDF-Germany decided to produce a musical television film in which he plays a series of his hits. The film was partially recorded in the Barrandov Studios in Prague, in Kempen and in Bobbejaanland, which at the time was still without attractions.

During the sixties and seventies, he was a regular visitor to the United States, where he took up with actor Roy Rogers, Nudie Cohn (the fashion designer of Elvis, Johnny Cash and others), and Tex Williams, the founding father of western swing. The foursome occasionally performed together in local clubs.

==Tours with a circus tent: 1958–1961==

In 1958, Schoepen purchased a big circus tent to be able to tour more efficiently in his own country. Doing so freed him from having to deal with music venue owners, who were asking for ever-increasing rental prices and did not always have appropriate space for his program. He took over the two-master circus tent from the Tondeur family, who were finding it difficult to keep their performances profitable. Schoepen was handed the organizational reins and the circus again began to flourish. The day before a show he would promote the show himself at the designated location, sometimes in his own bizarre manner.

An American circus stunt team came to Brussels on the occasion of the world exhibition, Expo 58; it was a private endeavor led by Casey Tibbs. But because of the excessively long distance to the actual Expo events, and the persistent bad weather, they went bankrupt. They could no longer afford to care for their fifty horses and so the team had to return to the US. Tibbs had no choice but to give away some of the equipment, and among other things he sold Zorro&#x27;s horse—named Midnight, from the Zorro television series—to Bobbejaan Schoepen. He used the horse for many years for stunts in his shows and as an attraction during his cavalcades, but the horse stepped on an exposed electricity cable and died.

In 1959, Schoepen bought a new circus tent. It had room for 900 people and could be expanded to accommodate a capacity of 1,200. These tours came to an end as soon as Bobbejaanland opened its doors in 1961. Using a circus tent for concert tours was unique for its time.

==Film==
Between 1950 and 1967 he acted in five musical film productions: two Belgian, two German, and one German-Czech. In 1962 he played the leading role in the absurd comedy, At the Drop of a Head (alias &quot;De Ordannans&quot;), together with leaders of the Flemish film scene: Ann Peterson, Yvonne Lex, Denise Deweerdt, Nand Buyl, and Tony Bell. The Dutch and English versions were recorded on the set at the same time. Schoepen was not pleased with this particular adventure into the world of film: &quot;The takes were chaotic and they fired two different directors. Jef Bruyninckx (alias, De Witte) had to solve everything.&quot; In 1999, the Belgian cult-rock band, Dead Man Ray, toured through Belgium and the Netherlands with the film. For Daan Stuyven (Daan) and Rudy Trouvé (ex-dEUS), it is also an ode to the sometimes misunderstood)artistic versatility that characterized Schoepen the artist:
:A true professional who was able to turn his jazzy country-guitar playing, his deep, angelic voice and his wacky sense of humor into a trademark and later into an amusement park.

== Bobbejaanland and caberet ==

It was never Schoepen&#x27;s intention to build an amusement park; the current park arose from his musical career. After nearly 15 years of constant touring, he began thinking about a place to settle down. In 1959, he bought a 30 hectare, marshy domain in Lichtaart-Kasterlee, called the Abroek. There he built a theater with nearly 1000 seats and created a 2.2 kilometer beach. This was to become Bobbejaanland, a name coined by his manager, Jacques Kluger. On 31 December 1961, Bobbejaanland was officially opened by Bobbejaan Schoepen and his wife Josée, with whom he developed the park into his life&#x27;s work. During the high season, Schoepen himself performed from two to five concerts per day. Artists from the Belgian, Dutch, and German cabaret-world performed there as well, though not during Schoepen&#x27;s own program.

Bobbejaanland evolved from 1975 onwards into a fully fledged amusement park. Schoepen focused his attention solely on the business aspect of the park, slowly pushing his musical career into the background. His performances became a rarity but Bobbejaanland, which he operated with his family, developed into one of the top amusement parks in the Benelux region.

In the mid-80s the shows became more streamlined, and oriented toward a more international audience. The amusement park finally dominated the cabaret, and the entrepreneur the artist. He did continue singing, albeit with more streamlined shows, which inevitably gave way to the routine of the amusement park.
:At a certain point my performances no longer had anything artistic about them. I received a phone call from my wife five minutes before I had to go on stage: &#x27;Two busses of Germans, one bus of Danes and three busses of Spaniards&#x27;. And then I adapted my show to suit them. There was no room for sentiment in Bobbejaanland. It was work, work, and more work in order to keep the business profitable. Sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. We employed four-hundred people who had to be paid every month.

==Challenges==

Bobbejaan Schoepen&#x27;s life was not without its difficulties: he was thrown into prison twice during wartime, he lost his virtuoso whistling ability due to a surgical intervention, and in 1986 he underwent a serious heart operation. In 1999 he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer, which raised the issue of selling Bobbejaanland, his life&#x27;s work. But he continued and, in the winter of 2003, a major investment of nearly 12 million euros was made on two unique rides (&quot;Typhoon&quot; and &quot;Sledge Hammer&quot;). That year, the Flemish consumer magazine Test-Aankoop conducted a comparative survey of 13 European amusement parks. Bobbejaanland was the most highly esteemed park in Belgium on almost every level, and in Europe it shared second place, together with Disneyland and the Parc Astérix.

However, in April 2004, after preparing for more than three years, the family finally decided to sell the park. At that time Bobbejaanland employed 400 people and was taken over by Parques Reunidos, a Spanish-American amusement park group. It remained uncertain until the very last minute whether the founder would put his signature on the deal. Uncertainty over the future of amusement parks was ultimately decisive. The Schoepen family chose the more certain path, which also seemed evident to the founder. After the sale, when the news program Terzake on the Flemish Broadcast VRT asked him if he had chosen to take the big money, Schoepen answered, staring ahead blankly, &quot;What am I going to do with all that money; I can only eat twice a day.&quot;

Schoepen was considered to be the artistic attraction of the park; his wife Josée (the oldest of eighteen children) was a leading figure and the commercial backbone; and her sister Louise (Wies) was the solid foundation with respect to accounting and finances.
:The key to the success of this family business is found in the loyalty within this triumvirate, as well as their work ethic, which was strengthened from the 1990s on by three of their five children.

With the sale of the park, the last family business in the amusement park sector in Belgium disappeared. Schoepen and his wife lived on the domain together, until his death in May 2010.

==Comeback==
Schoepen recovered from his illness and was again engaged in music. In 2005 he gave four surprise performances at the literary festival Saint-Amour, where he again brought people his well-known &quot;De lichtjes van de Schelde&quot;. The song dated from 1952 and since then has been covered many times by popular Flemish and Dutch artists such as Louis Neefs, Hans De Booij, Wannes Van de Velde, and recently by Will Tura and DAAN. In November 2006 at the Radio2 &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, the song was performed by Bobbejaan admirer Daan Stuyven. That month, with the efforts of his son Tom Schoepen, Bobbejaan Records was brought back to life. The record company was established in 1966 but lapsed following the success of Bobbejaanland. The label is now focused on releases centered on Bobbejaan Schoepen.

===Award===
On 13 February 2007, with much media attention, Schoepen received a Lifetime Achievement Award in the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels for his successful career as a singer, musician, and for his pioneering work in Belgian music history.

===Another album===
After Bobbejaanland was sold, Schoepen focussed on his music career, resulting in the new album release &quot;Bobbejaan&quot; (Bobbejaan Records/PIAS) in May 2008, his first album in 35 years. The album was mixed at South Beach Studios in Miami.

The idea for this project originated with music producer Firmin Michiels and the Dead Man Ray-tour in 1999, but the idea was shelved when Schoepen was diagnosed with cancer. In 2005, the idea was revived by Michiels (A&amp;R) and executive producer Tom Schoepen, who would concentrate fully on the production of Bob&#x27;s voice recordings. Michiels was aware that Bobbejaan Schoepen could not just pick up where he left off and carry his show for a large audience: his top years were long past and the amusement park had inflicted too much damage on the singer. But slowly his credibility returned. The album was recorded with five Belgian musicians in Schoepen&#x27;s living room; he would have to deal with various health issues throughout the recording sessions. The release in May 2008 immediately received broad attention from the TV-journals and other media.

==Final years and death==
In July 2008 he was inducted as the first European into the &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Hall of Fame&quot;, by the US International Whistlers Convention.

In December 2009, an official compilation with 76 songs spanning 60 years of musical career was released: &quot;The World of Bobbejaan — Songbook&quot; (Bobbejaan Records).

Schoepen died on 17 May 2010, the day after his 85th birthday, from cardiac arrest.

<doc id="248613" wikidata="Q926382" url="?curid=248613" title="The Land Girls">
<text>The Land Girls is a 1998 film directed by David Leland and starring Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel, Steven Mackintosh and Ann Bell. The film is a British/French co-production based on the 1995 novel &quot;Land Girls&quot; by Angela Huth.

The title refers to the real-life British women who were called upon to assist rural Englanders when men left their farms to fight in the First and Second World Wars.

== Plot ==
During both the First and Second World Wars, the Women&#x27;s Land Army was set up in the United Kingdom to recruit women to work at farms where men had left to go to war. Women in the WLA were nicknamed &quot;land girls&quot;.

Set in 1941 in the Dorset countryside, three &quot;land girls&quot; arrive on a remote farm. They are an unlikely trio: hairdresser Prue is vivacious and sexy, Cambridge University graduate Ag is quiet and more reserved, and dreamy Stella is in love with Philip, a dashing Royal Navy officer. Despite the women&#x27;s differences, they soon become close friends. The film follows their relationships with each other and the men in their lives in the face of war.

== Cast ==
*Catherine McCormack as Stella
*Rachel Weisz as Ag (Agapanthus)
*Anna Friel as Prue (Prudence)
*Steven Mackintosh as Joe Lawrence
*Tom Georgeson as Mr Lawrence
*Maureen O&#x27;Brien as Mrs Lawrence
*Lucy Akhurst as Janet
*Gerald Down as Ratty, Lawrence Farm Hand
*Paul Bettany as Philip

== Production ==
Filming locations included the scenic Exmoor National Park, Crowcombe Heathfield station on the West Somerset Railway and Dulverton.

The film cost £6 million.

==Reception==
The film holds a 61% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.

In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote, &quot;The movie is ultimately more passionate about its characters&#x27; place in history than about their individual lives, which take fairly predictable if not always happy turns. In the end, all three women blend together as an idealized everywoman lightly sketched on a larger historical canvas.&quot;

Holden concluded, &quot;The film&#x27;s most evocative historical set piece shows a parade and air show at which a newly built Spitfire makes its maiden flight. The movie is unequivocal about the nobility of this moment. The shared sacrifice and hard labor have all been worth it. As the aircraft soars and dips across the rural English landscape, it is the very embodiment of a glorious winged victory soon to come.&quot;

Roger Ebert praised the cinematography in particular, stating &quot;What I liked about the movie--what I preferred to the romances and relationships--was its look, its sensual evocation of the British countryside in winter.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;Wistful but not precious, &#x27;&quot;The Land Girls&quot;&#x27; takes a bit of acclimatizing, but Leland (&quot;&#x27;Wish You Were Here&quot;&#x27;) makes his leisurely pacing an attribute. The film sinks into the green, serene countryside, a place where emotions echo big.&quot;

=== Box office ===
After 11 weeks on release the film had grossed £1.3 million ($2.2 million) in the United Kingdom. It grossed $1 million internationally for a worldwide total of $3.2 million.

<text>The Women&#x27;s Land Army (WLA) was a British civilian organisation created in 1917 by the Board of Agriculture during the First World War to bring women into work in agriculture, replacing men called up to the military. Women who worked for the WLA were commonly known as Land Girls (Land Lassies). The Land Army placed women with farms that needed workers, the farmers being their employers. The members picked crops and did all the labour to feed the country. Notable members include Joan Quennell, later a Member of Parliament; John Stewart Collis, Irish author and pioneer ecologist; the archaeologist Lily Chitty and the botanist Ethel Thomas. It was disbanded in 1919 but revived in June 1939 under the same name to again organise new workers to replace workers that served in the military during the Second World War.

==History==
===First World War===

The Women&#x27;s Farm and Garden Union had existed since 1899 and in February 1916 they sent a deputation to meet Lord Selborne. Selborne&#x27;s Ministry of Agriculture agreed to fund a Women’s National Land Service Corps with a grant of £150. Louise Wilkins was to lead the new organisation that was to focus on recruiting women for emergency war work. They were tasked with improving recruitment and provide propaganda about the good cause of women of all classes undertaking agricultural work. The new members of the organisation were to not become agricultural workers but to organise others (e.g. in villages) to do this work. By the end of 1916 they had recruited 2,000 volunteers but they estimated that 40,000 was required. At the Women’s National Land Service Corps&#x27;s suggestion a Land Army was formed. The WNLSC continued to deal with recruitment and the network assisted in the launch of a &quot;Land Army&quot;; by April 1917 they had over 500 replies and 88 joined the new Land Army where they became group leaders and supervisors.
In time the Land Army would take on 23,000 workers who took the place of the 100,000 workers lost to the forces. The women were paid 18 shillings a week and this could be increased to 20 shillings (a pound) if they were considered efficient. 23,000 was a significant contribution but there were estimated to be 300,000 women working on the land during the First World War.

A Good Service Ribbon was awarded to eligible women. January 1918 saw the publication of the first issue of &quot;The Landswoman&quot;, the official monthly magazine of the Women’s Land Army and the Women’s Institutes. The organisation was disbanded in November 1919.

===Second World War===

As the prospect of war became increasingly likely, the government wanted to increase the amount of food grown within Britain. In April 1939, peacetime conscription was introduced for the first time in British history, which led to shortages of workers on the farms. To grow more food, more help was needed on the farms and so the government restarted the Women&#x27;s Land Army in July 1939. Though under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, it was given an honorary head – Lady Denman. At first it asked for volunteers. This was supplemented by conscription, so that by 1944 it had over 80,000 members.

Inez Jenkins, who had served as Lady Deman&#x27;s assistant director during the establishment of the WLA served as Chief Administrative Officer until 1948. The last Chief of the WLA was Amy Curtis. The WLA lasted until its official disbandment on 30 November 1950.

The majority of the Land Girls already lived in the countryside, but more than a third came from London and the industrial cities of the north of England. A separate branch was set up in 1942 for forestry industry work, officially known as the Women&#x27;s Timber Corps and with its members colloquially known as &quot;Lumber Jills&quot; – this was disbanded in 1946.

In 1943, during the Second World War, Amelia King was refused work because she was black. The decision was overturned after being raised in the House of Commons by her MP, Walter Edwards.

===Commemoration===
In October 2012, the Prince of Wales unveiled the first memorial to the WLA of both World Wars, on the Fochabers estate in Moray, Scotland. The sculpture was designed by Peter Naylor. In October 2014, a memorial statue to the Women&#x27;s Timber Corps and both incarnations of the Women&#x27;s Land Army was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, England.

==Recognition==

In 1925 the Five Sisters window at York Minster was rededicated to the 1,513 women who died in the line of service during WWI, including ten women from the Land Army.
In December 2007, following campaigning by former Land Girl Hilda Gibson, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) announced that the efforts of the Women&#x27;s Land Army and the Women&#x27;s Timber Corps would be formally recognised with the presentation of a specially designed commemorative badge to the surviving members. The badge of honour was awarded in July 2008 to over 45,000 former Land Girls.

In October 2012, the Prince of Wales unveiled the first memorial to the WLA of both World Wars, on the Fochabers estate in Moray, Scotland. The sculpture was designed by Peter Naylor. In October 2014, a memorial statue to the Women&#x27;s Timber Corps and both incarnations of the Women&#x27;s Land Army was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, England.

<text>The Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) is a socialist political party in the United States which operates mostly in California. It was formed in 1966 from anti–Vietnam War and pro–civil rights movements.

PFP operates both as an organization unto itself and an umbrella organization in which socialist organizations compete to win PFP&#x27;s ballot access.

Notable past and present members include Bob Avakian, Emmy Lou Packard, Byron Randall, and (briefly) Murray Rothbard.

== Organization ==

=== Members ===
In January 2000, PFP had 75,277 registered voters. In February 2005, PFP had 67,238 registered voters. In January 2010, PFP had 55,036 registered voters. In January 2016, PFP had 75,579 registered voters.

In February 2019, PFP had 76,784 registered voters. In February 2021, PFP had 105,535 registered voters. In January 2024, PFP had 133,914 registered voters.

=== Preference primaries ===
Like many minor parties, PFP holds a non-binding &quot;preference primary&quot; for President. The PFP presidential candidate is ultimately selected by the PFP State Convention, at which only State Executive Committee (SEC) members can vote. The SEC is directly elected through write-ins in the California primary system every two years. The SEC had about 130 members in 2024 and 90 in 2008.

Since January 2001, California has had a &quot;modified&quot; closed primary system in which political parties can determine whether or not to allow voters who are not affiliated with any party, or No Party Preference, are allowed to participate in the party&#x27;s primary. Since the 2004 primaries, PFP has never allowed &quot;independent&quot; voters to vote in their party&#x27;s primaries.

== Ideology ==
PFP is a socialist party &quot;committed to feminism, [...] democracy, ecology, and racial equality&quot;, PFP strongly supports environmentalism, aboriginal rights, LGBT rights, abortion rights, public healthcare, public education, and subsidized housing. PFP is Anti-Zionist.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
After the 1967 Century City anti-Vietnam War march on June 23, 1967, anti-war and civil rights supporters began collecting petitions for the Peace and Freedom Party. PFP&#x27;s founders opposed the Democratic Party&#x27;s support for the war in Vietnam and saw the Democrats as failing to effectively support the civil rights movement.

On January 2, 1968, PFP organizers submitted 105,100 signatures to receive party status in California. PFP has had ballot access in California since 1968, except between 1998 and 2002. In 2003, PFP became the first party in the history of California to regain its ballot status.

In 1968, PFP suffered a minor split: Dick Gregory and others split to create the Freedom and Peace Party (FPP), for which Gregory ran in the 1968 United States presidential election. The FPP collapsed after the 1968 election.

In 1971, progressives nationwide organized the People&#x27;s Party. In 1972 and 1976, PFP endorsed the PP&#x27;s candidates. After the PP dissolved in 1977, PFP continued in California.

In the 2006 California elections, two statewide Peace and Freedom Party candidates received more than the required vote, thus ensuring the party&#x27;s ballot status for another four years (Elizabeth Cervantes Barron received 212,383 votes, 2.5% of the total, for Controller; and Tom Condit received 187,618 votes, 2.2% of the total, for Insurance Commissioner).

California&#x27;s 2018 gubernatorial primary had statewide office candidates registered in the party. In the race for Insurance Commissioner, Peace and Freedom candidate Nathalie Hrizi received 316,149 votes, 5.0% of the total.

== Election results ==
The PFP has fielded over 200 electoral candidates in the United States for local, state, and federal offices. PFP candidates usually run as official PFP candidates on their own ballot line.

No PFP candidate has yet won a contested election.

=== Presidential elections ===
Convention votes:
Johnson is Citizen&#x27;s Party

In 2016, both PFP&#x27;s California state chair and Green candidate Jill Stein requested that the California Secretary of State allow Stein to be placed on the PFP party ballot, but this was rejected. Instead, PFP nominated Party for Socialism and Liberation candidate Gloria La Riva.

In 2012, Rocky Anderson won a plurality of delegates in PFP&#x27;s non-binding preference primary, after failing to win enough votes to place his Justice Party on the ballot. However, Anderson failed to win representatives on the PFP&#x27;s Central Committee, and withdrew 1 week before the convention. Instead, PFP backed Party for Socialism and Liberation&#x27;s preferred candidate Roseanne Barr.

In 2008, PFP endorsed Independent Ralph Nader in his presidential campaign. Nader obtained enough signatures to appear on the ballot in Iowa and Utah as the Peace and Freedom Party candidate. This was the first expansion of the party beyond California since the 1970s. However, PFP did not obtain enough votes to guarantee ballot access in Iowa or Utah in subsequent elections.

In 2000, PFP did not qualify for the ballot in California.

In 1988, three factions within PFP — the Internationalist Workers Party, New Alliance Party, and Socialist Party USA plus Communist Party USA — sought the party&#x27;s ballot line. They could not agree, and split the convention, which resulted in the Secretary of State voiding the PFP ballot line for the year.

<doc id="248635" wikidata="Q1408937" url="?curid=248635" title="Group cohomology">
<text>In mathematics (more specifically, in homological algebra), group cohomology is a set of mathematical tools used to study groups using cohomology theory, a technique from algebraic topology. Analogous to group representations, group cohomology looks at the group actions of a group &quot;G&quot; in an associated &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; to elucidate the properties of the group. By treating the &quot;G&quot;-module as a kind of topological space with elements of formula_1 representing &quot;n&quot;-simplices, topological properties of the space may be computed, such as the set of cohomology groups formula_2. The cohomology groups in turn provide insight into the structure of the group &quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; themselves. Group cohomology plays a role in the investigation of fixed points of a group action in a module or space and the quotient module or space with respect to a group action. Group cohomology is used in the fields of abstract algebra, homological algebra, algebraic topology and algebraic number theory, as well as in applications to group theory proper. As in algebraic topology, there is a dual theory called &quot;group homology&quot;. The techniques of group cohomology can also be extended to the case that instead of a &quot;G&quot;-module, &quot;G&quot; acts on a nonabelian &quot;G&quot;-group; in effect, a generalization of a module to non-Abelian coefficients.

These algebraic ideas are closely related to topological ideas. The group cohomology of a discrete group &quot;G&quot; is the singular cohomology of a suitable space having &quot;G&quot; as its fundamental group, namely the corresponding Eilenberg–MacLane space. Thus, the group cohomology of formula_3 can be thought of as the singular cohomology of the circle S1. Likewise, the group cohomology of formula_4 is the singular cohomology of formula_5

A great deal is known about the cohomology of groups, including interpretations of low-dimensional cohomology, functoriality, and how to change groups. The subject of group cohomology began in the 1920s, matured in the late 1940s, and continues as an area of active research today.

== Motivation ==
A general paradigm in group theory is that a group &quot;G&quot; should be studied via its group representations. A slight generalization of those representations are the &quot;G&quot;-modules: a &quot;G&quot;-module is an abelian group &quot;M&quot; together with a group action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;M&quot;, with every element of &quot;G&quot; acting as an automorphism of &quot;M&quot;. We will write &quot;G&quot; multiplicatively and &quot;M&quot; additively.

Given such a &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, it is natural to consider the submodule of &quot;G&quot;-invariant elements:

:formula_6

Now, if &quot;N&quot; is a &quot;G&quot;-submodule of &quot;M&quot; (i.e., a subgroup of &quot;M&quot; mapped to itself by the action of &quot;G&quot;), it isn&#x27;t in general true that the invariants in formula_7 are found as the quotient of the invariants in &quot;M&quot; by those in &quot;N&quot;: being invariant &#x27;modulo &quot;N&quot; &#x27; is broader. The purpose of the first group cohomology formula_8 is to precisely measure this difference.

The group cohomology functors formula_9 in general measure the extent to which taking invariants doesn&#x27;t respect exact sequences. This is expressed by a long exact sequence.

== Definitions ==
The collection of all &quot;G&quot;-modules is a category (the morphisms are equivariant group homomorphisms, that is group homomorphisms &quot;f&quot; with the property formula_10 for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;). Sending each module &quot;M&quot; to the group of invariants formula_11 yields a functor from the category of &quot;G&quot;-modules to the category Ab of abelian groups. This functor is left exact but not necessarily right exact. We may therefore form its right derived functors. Their values are abelian groups and they are denoted by formula_2, &quot;the &quot;n&quot;-th cohomology group of &quot;G&quot; with coefficients in &quot;M&quot;&quot;. Furthermore, the group formula_13 may be identified with formula_11.

===Cochain complexes===
The definition using derived functors is conceptually very clear, but for concrete applications, the following computations, which some authors also use as a definition, are often helpful. For formula_15 let formula_16 be the group of all functions from formula_1 to &quot;M&quot; (here formula_18 means formula_19). This is an abelian group; its elements are called the (inhomogeneous) &quot;n&quot;-cochains. The coboundary homomorphisms are defined by

:formula_20

One may check that formula_21 so this defines a cochain complex whose cohomology can be computed. It can be shown that the above-mentioned definition of group cohomology in terms of derived functors is isomorphic to the cohomology of this complex

:formula_22

Here the groups of &quot;n&quot;-cocycles, and &quot;n&quot;-coboundaries, respectively, are defined as

:formula_23
:formula_24

===The functors Ext&quot;n&quot; and formal definition of group cohomology===
Interpreting &quot;G&quot;-modules as modules over the group ring formula_25 one can note that

:formula_26

i.e., the subgroup of &quot;G&quot;-invariant elements in &quot;M&quot; is identified with the group of homomorphisms from formula_3, which is treated as the trivial &quot;G&quot;-module (every element of &quot;G&quot; acts as the identity) to &quot;M&quot;.

Therefore, as Ext functors are the derived functors of Hom, there is a natural isomorphism

:formula_28

These Ext groups can also be computed via a projective resolution of formula_3, the advantage being that such a resolution only depends on &quot;G&quot; and not on &quot;M&quot;. We recall the definition of Ext more explicitly for this context. Let &quot;F&quot; be a projective formula_30-resolution (e.g. a free formula_30-resolution) of the trivial formula_30-module formula_3:

:formula_34

e.g., one may always take the resolution of group rings, formula_35 with morphisms

:formula_36

Recall that for formula_30-modules &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, Hom&quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) is an abelian group consisting of formula_30-homomorphisms from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;M&quot;. Since formula_39 is a contravariant functor and reverses the arrows, applying formula_39 to &quot;F&quot; termwise and dropping formula_41 produces a cochain complex formula_42:

:formula_43

The cohomology groups formula_44 of &quot;G&quot; with coefficients in the module &quot;M&quot; are defined as the cohomology of the above cochain complex:

:formula_45

This construction initially leads to a coboundary operator that acts on the &quot;homogeneous&quot; cochains. These are the elements of formula_46, that is, functions formula_47 that obey

:formula_48

The coboundary operator formula_49 is now naturally defined by, for example,

:formula_50

The relation to the coboundary operator &quot;d&quot; that was defined in the previous section, and which acts on the &quot;inhomogeneous&quot; cochains formula_51, is given by reparameterizing so that

:formula_52

and so on. Thus

:formula_53

as in the preceding section.

== Group homology ==
Dually to the construction of group cohomology there is the following definition of group homology: given a &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, set &quot;DM&quot; to be the submodule generated by elements of the form &quot;g&quot;·&quot;m&quot; − &quot;m&quot;, &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;, &quot;m&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;. Assigning to &quot;M&quot; its so-called &quot;coinvariants&quot;, the quotient

:formula_54

is a right exact functor. Its left derived functors are by definition the group homology

:formula_55

The covariant functor which assigns &quot;MG&quot; to &quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to the functor which sends &quot;M&quot; to formula_56 where formula_3 is endowed with the trivial &quot;G&quot;-action. Hence one also gets an expression for group homology in terms of the Tor functors,

:formula_58

Note that the superscript/subscript convention for cohomology/homology agrees with the convention for group invariants/coinvariants, while which is denoted &quot;co-&quot; switches:
* superscripts correspond to cohomology &quot;H*&quot; and invariants &quot;XG&quot; while
* subscripts correspond to homology &quot;H&quot;∗ and coinvariants &quot;XG&quot; := &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot;.

Specifically, the homology groups &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) can be computed as follows. Start with a projective resolution &quot;F&quot; of the trivial formula_30-module formula_60 as in the previous section. Apply the covariant functor formula_61 to &quot;F&quot; termwise to get a chain complex formula_62:

:formula_63

Then &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) are the homology groups of this chain complex, formula_64 for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0.

Group homology and cohomology can be treated uniformly for some groups, especially finite groups, in terms of complete resolutions and the Tate cohomology groups.

The group homology formula_65 of abelian groups &quot;G&quot; with values in a principal ideal domain &quot;k&quot; is closely related to the exterior algebra formula_66.

==Low-dimensional cohomology groups==

===&quot;H&quot; 1===
The first cohomology group is the quotient of the so-called &quot;crossed homomorphisms&quot;, i.e. maps (of sets) &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;M&quot; satisfying &quot;f&quot;(&quot;ab&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) + &quot;af&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, modulo the so-called &quot;principal crossed homomorphisms&quot;, i.e. maps &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;M&quot; given by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) = &quot;gm&quot;−&quot;m&quot; for some fixed &quot;m&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;. This follows from the definition of cochains above.

If the action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is &quot;trivial&quot;, then the above boils down to &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;M&quot;) = Hom(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot;), the group of group homomorphisms &quot;G&quot; → &quot;M&quot;, since the crossed homomorphisms are then just ordinary homomorphisms and the coboundaries (i.e. the principal crossed homomorphisms) must have image identically zero: hence there is only the zero coboundary.

On the other hand, consider the case of formula_67 where formula_68 denotes the &quot;non-trivial&quot; formula_69-structure on the additive group of integers, which sends &quot;a&quot; to &quot;-a&quot; for every formula_70; and where we regard formula_69 as the group formula_72. By considering all possible cases for the images of formula_73, it may be seen that crossed homomorphisms constitute all maps formula_74 satisfying formula_75 and formula_76 for some arbitrary choice of integer &quot;t&quot;. Principal crossed homomorphisms must additionally satisfy formula_77 for some integer &quot;m&quot;: hence every crossed homomorphism formula_78 sending &quot;-1&quot; to an even integer formula_79 is principal, and therefore:

:formula_80

with the group operation being pointwise addition: formula_81, noting that formula_82 is the identity element. 

===&quot;H&quot; 2===
If &quot;M&quot; is a trivial &quot;G&quot;-module (i.e. the action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is trivial), the second cohomology group &quot;H&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;M&quot;) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of central extensions of &quot;G&quot; by &quot;M&quot; (up to a natural equivalence relation). More generally, if the action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is nontrivial, &quot;H&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;M&quot;) classifies the isomorphism classes of all extensions formula_83 of &quot;G&quot; by &quot;M,&quot; in which the action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;E&quot; (by inner automorphisms), endows (the image of) &quot;M&quot; with an isomorphic &quot;G&quot;-module structure.

In the example from the section on formula_84 immediately above, formula_85 as the only extension of formula_69 by formula_3 with the given nontrivial action is the infinite dihedral group, which is a split extension and so trivial inside the formula_88 group. 
This is in fact the significance in group-theoretical terms of the unique non-trivial element of formula_67. 

An example of a second cohomology group is the Brauer group: it is the cohomology of the absolute Galois group of a field &quot;k&quot; which acts on the invertible elements in a separable closure:

:formula_90

== Basic examples ==

=== Group cohomology of a finite cyclic group ===
For the finite cyclic group formula_91 of order formula_92 with generator formula_93, the element formula_94 in the associated group ring is a divisor of zero because its product with formula_95, given byformula_96givesformula_97This property can be used to construct the resolution of the trivial formula_98-module formula_99 via the complexformula_100giving the group cohomology computation for any formula_98-module formula_102. Note the augmentation map gives the trivial module formula_99 its formula_98-structure byformula_105This resolution gives a computation of the group cohomology since there is the isomorphism of cohomology groupsformula_106showing that applying the functor formula_107 to the complex above (with formula_99 removed since this resolution is a quasi-isomorphism), gives the computationformula_109forformula_110For example, if formula_111, the trivial module, then formula_112, formula_113, and formula_114, henceformula_115

==== Explicit cocycles ====
Cocycles for the group cohomology of a cyclic group can be given explicitly using the Bar resolution. We get a complete set of generators of formula_116-cocycles for formula_116 odd as the mapsformula_118given byformula_119for formula_116 odd, formula_121, formula_122 a primitive formula_92-th root of unity, formula_124 a field containing formula_92-th roots of unity, andformula_126for a rational number formula_127 denoting the largest integer not greater than formula_127. Also, we are using the notationformula_129where formula_130 is a generator for formula_131. Note that for formula_116 non-zero even indices the cohomology groups are trivial.

=== Cohomology of free groups ===

==== Using a resolution ====
Given a set formula_133 the associated free group formula_134 has an explicit resolution of the trivial module formula_135 which can be easily computed. Notice the augmentation mapformula_136has kernel given by the free submodule formula_137 generated by the set formula_138, soformula_139.Because this object is free, this gives a resolutionformula_140hence the group cohomology of formula_141 with coefficients in formula_135 can be computed by applying the functor formula_143 to the complex formula_144, givingformula_145this is because the dual mapformula_146sends any formula_98-module morphismformula_148to the induced morphism on formula_137 by composing the inclusion. The only maps which are sent to formula_150 are formula_99-multiples of the augmentation map, giving the first cohomology group. The second can be found by noticing the only other mapsformula_152can be generated by the formula_99-basis of maps sending formula_154 for a fixed formula_155, and sending formula_156 for any formula_157.

==== Using topology ====
The group cohomology of free groups formula_158 generated by formula_159 letters can be readily computed by comparing group cohomology with its interpretation in topology. Recall that for every group formula_141 there is a topological space formula_161, called the classifying space of the group, which has the propertyformula_162.In addition, it has the property that its topological cohomology is isomorphic to group cohomologyformula_163giving a way to compute some group cohomology groups. Note formula_99 could be replaced by any local system formula_165 which is determined by a mapformula_166for some abelian group formula_167. In the case of formula_168 for formula_159 letters, this is represented by a wedge sum of formula_159 circles formula_171 which can be showed using the Van-Kampen theorem, giving the group cohomologyformula_172

=== Group cohomology of an integral lattice ===
For an integral lattice formula_173 of rank formula_159 (hence isomorphic to formula_175), its group cohomology can be computed with relative ease. First, because formula_176, and formula_177 has formula_178, which as abelian groups are isomorphic to formula_179, the group cohomology has the isomorphismformula_180with the integral cohomology of a torus of rank formula_159.

==Properties==

In the following, let &quot;M&quot; be a &quot;G&quot;-module.

===Long exact sequence of cohomology===
In practice, one often computes the cohomology groups using the following fact: if

:formula_182

is a short exact sequence of &quot;G&quot;-modules, then a long exact sequence is induced:

:formula_183

The so-called connecting homomorphisms,

:formula_184

can be described in terms of inhomogeneous cochains as follows. If formula_185 is represented by an &quot;n&quot;-cocycle formula_186 then formula_187 is represented by formula_188 where formula_189 is an &quot;n&quot;-cochain formula_190 &quot;lifting&quot; formula_191 (i.e. formula_191 is the composition of formula_189 with the surjective map &quot;M&quot; → &quot;N&quot;).

===Functoriality===
Group cohomology depends contravariantly on the group &quot;G&quot;, in the following sense: if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;H&quot; → &quot;G&quot; is a group homomorphism, then we have a naturally induced morphism &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) → &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) (where in the latter, &quot;M&quot; is treated as an &quot;H&quot;-module via &quot;f&quot;). This map is called the &quot;restriction map&quot;. If the index of &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is finite, there is also a map in the opposite direction, called &quot;transfer map&quot;,

:formula_194

In degree 0, it is given by the map

:formula_195

Given a morphism of &quot;G&quot;-modules &quot;M&quot; → &quot;N&quot;, one gets a morphism of cohomology groups in the &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) → &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;N&quot;).

===Products===
Similarly to other cohomology theories in topology and geometry, such as singular cohomology or de Rham cohomology, group cohomology enjoys a product structure: there is a natural map called &quot;cup product&quot;:

:formula_196

for any two &quot;G&quot;-modules &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;. This yields a graded anti-commutative ring structure on formula_197 where &quot;R&quot; is a ring such as formula_3 or formula_199 For a finite group &quot;G&quot;, the even part of this cohomology ring in characteristic &quot;p&quot;, formula_200 carries a lot of information about the group the structure of &quot;G&quot;, for example the Krull dimension of this ring equals the maximal rank of an abelian subgroup formula_201.

For example, let &quot;G&quot; be the group with two elements, under the discrete topology. The real projective space formula_202 is a classifying space for &quot;G&quot;. Let formula_203 the field of two elements. Then

:formula_204

a polynomial &quot;k&quot;-algebra on a single generator, since this is the cellular cohomology ring of formula_5

===Künneth formula===

If, &quot;M&quot; = &quot;k&quot; is a field, then &quot;H*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;; &quot;k&quot;) is a graded &quot;k&quot;-algebra and the cohomology of a product of groups is related to the ones of the individual groups by a Künneth formula:

:formula_206

For example, if &quot;G&quot; is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank &quot;r&quot;, and formula_203 then the Künneth formula shows that the cohomology of &quot;G&quot; is a polynomial &quot;k&quot;-algebra generated by &quot;r&quot; classes in &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;; &quot;k&quot;).,

:formula_208

===Homology vs. cohomology===
As for other cohomology theories, such as singular cohomology, group cohomology and homology are related to one another by means of a short exact sequence

:formula_209

where &quot;A&quot; is endowed with the trivial &quot;G&quot;-action and the term at the left is the first Ext group.

===Amalgamated products===
Given a group &quot;A&quot; which is the subgroup of two groups &quot;G&quot;1 and &quot;G&quot;2, the homology of the amalgamated product formula_210 (with integer coefficients) lies in a long exact sequence

:formula_211

The homology of formula_212 can be computed using this:

:formula_213

This exact sequence can also be applied to show that the homology of the formula_214 and the special linear group formula_215 agree for an infinite field &quot;k&quot;.

===Change of group===
The Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence relates the cohomology of a normal subgroup &quot;N&quot; of &quot;G&quot; and the quotient &quot;G/N&quot; to the cohomology of the group &quot;G&quot; (for (pro-)finite groups &quot;G&quot;). From it, one gets the inflation-restriction exact sequence.

===Cohomology of the classifying space===
Group cohomology is closely related to topological cohomology theories such as sheaf cohomology, by means of an isomorphism

:formula_216

The expression &quot;formula_161&quot; at the left is a classifying space for formula_141. It is an Eilenberg–MacLane space formula_219, i.e., a space whose fundamental group is formula_141 and whose higher homotopy groups vanish). Classifying spaces for formula_221 and formula_222 are the 1-sphere S1, infinite real projective space formula_223 and lens spaces, respectively. In general, &quot;formula_161&quot; can be constructed as the quotient formula_225, where formula_226 is a contractible space on which formula_141 acts freely. However, &quot;formula_161&quot; does not usually have an easily amenable geometric description.

More generally, one can attach to any formula_141-module formula_230 a local coefficient system on formula_161 and the above isomorphism generalizes to an isomorphism

:formula_232

== Further examples ==

=== Semi-direct products of groups ===
There is a way to compute the semi-direct product of groups using the topology of fibrations and properties of Eilenberg-Maclane spaces. Recall that for a semi-direct product of groups formula_233 there is an associated short exact sequence of groupsformula_234Using the associated Eilenberg-Maclane spaces there is a Serre fibrationformula_235which can be put through a Serre spectral sequence. This gives an formula_236-pageformula_237which gives information about the group cohomology of formula_141 from the group cohomology groups of formula_239. Note this formalism can be applied in a purely group-theoretic manner using the Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence.

==Cohomology of finite groups==

===Higher cohomology groups are torsion===
The cohomology groups &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) of finite groups &quot;G&quot; are all torsion for all &quot;n&quot;≥1. Indeed, by Maschke&#x27;s theorem the category of representations of a finite group is semi-simple over any field of characteristic zero (or more generally, any field whose characteristic does not divide the order of the group), hence, viewing group cohomology as a derived functor in this abelian category, one obtains that it is zero. The other argument is that over a field of characteristic zero, the group algebra of a finite group is a direct sum of matrix algebras (possibly over division algebras which are extensions of the original field), while a matrix algebra is Morita equivalent to its base field and hence has trivial cohomology.

If the order of &quot;G&quot; is invertible in a &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; (for example, if &quot;M&quot; is a formula_240-vector space), the transfer map can be used to show that formula_241 for formula_242 A typical application of this fact is as follows: the long exact cohomology sequence of the short exact sequence (where all three groups have a trivial &quot;G&quot;-action)

:formula_243

yields an isomorphism

:formula_244

===Tate cohomology===
Tate cohomology groups combine both homology and cohomology of a finite group &quot;G&quot;:

:formula_245

where formula_246 is induced by the norm map:

:formula_247

Tate cohomology enjoys similar features, such as long exact sequences, product structures. An important application is in class field theory, see class formation.

Tate cohomology of finite cyclic groups, formula_248 is 2-periodic in the sense that there are isomorphisms

:formula_249

A necessary and sufficient criterion for a &quot;d&quot;-periodic cohomology is that the only abelian subgroups of &quot;G&quot; are cyclic. For example, any semi-direct product formula_250 has this property for coprime integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;.

==Applications==

===Algebraic K-theory and homology of linear groups===
Algebraic K-theory is closely related to group cohomology: in Quillen&#x27;s +-construction of K-theory, &quot;K&quot;-theory of a ring &quot;R&quot; is defined as the homotopy groups of a space formula_251 Here formula_252 is the infinite general linear group. The space formula_253 has the same homology as formula_254 &quot;i.e.&quot;, the group homology of GL(&quot;R&quot;). In some cases, &quot;stability&quot; results assert that the sequence of cohomology groups

:formula_255

becomes stationary for large enough &quot;n&quot;, hence reducing the computation of the cohomology of the infinite general linear group to the one of some formula_256. Such results have been established when &quot;R&quot; is a field or for rings of integers in a number field.

The phenomenon that group homology of a series of groups formula_257 stabilizes is referred to as homological stability. In addition to the case formula_258 just mentioned, this applies to various other groups such as symmetric groups or mapping class groups.

===Projective representations and group extensions===

In quantum mechanics we often have systems with a symmetry group formula_259 We expect an action of formula_141 on the Hilbert space formula_261 by unitary matrices formula_262 We might expect formula_263 but the rules of quantum mechanics only require

:formula_264

where formula_265 is a phase. This projective representation of formula_141 can also be thought of as a conventional representation of a group extension formula_267 of formula_141 by formula_269 as described by the exact sequence

:formula_270

Requiring associativity

:formula_271

leads to

:formula_272

which we recognise as the statement that formula_273 i.e. that formula_274 is a cocycle taking values in formula_275 We can ask whether we can eliminate the phases by redefining

:formula_276

which changes

:formula_277

This we recognise as shifting formula_274 by a coboundary formula_279 The distinct projective representations are therefore classified by formula_280 Note that if we allow the phases themselves to be acted on by the group (for example, time reversal would complex-conjugate the phase), then the first term in each of the coboundary operations will have a formula_281 acting on it as in the general definitions of coboundary in the previous sections. For example, formula_282

==Extensions==

===Cohomology of topological groups===
Given a topological group &quot;G&quot;, i.e., a group equipped with a topology such that product and inverse are continuous maps, it is natural to consider continuous &quot;G&quot;-modules, i.e., requiring that the action

:formula_283

is a continuous map. For such modules, one can again consider the derived functor of formula_284. A special case occurring in algebra and number theory is when &quot;G&quot; is profinite, for example the absolute Galois group of a field. The resulting cohomology is called Galois cohomology.

===Non-abelian group cohomology===
Using the &quot;G&quot;-invariants and the 1-cochains, one can construct the zeroth and first group cohomology for a group &quot;G&quot; with coefficients in a non-abelian group. Specifically, a &quot;G&quot;-group is a (not necessarily abelian) group &quot;A&quot; together with an action by &quot;G&quot;.

The &quot;zeroth cohomology of G with coefficients in A&quot; is defined to be the subgroup

:formula_285

of elements of &quot;A&quot; fixed by &quot;G&quot;.

The &quot;first cohomology of G with coefficients in A&quot; is defined as 1-cocycles modulo an equivalence relation instead of by 1-coboundaries. The condition for a map formula_286 to be a 1-cocycle is that formula_287 and formula_288 if there is an &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot; such that formula_289. In general, formula_290 is not a group when &quot;A&quot; is non-abelian. It instead has the structure of a pointed set – exactly the same situation arises in the 0th homotopy group, formula_291 which for a general topological space is not a group but a pointed set. Note that a group is in particular a pointed set, with the identity element as distinguished point.

Using explicit calculations, one still obtains a &quot;truncated&quot; long exact sequence in cohomology. Specifically, let

:formula_292

be a short exact sequence of &quot;G&quot;-groups, then there is an exact sequence of pointed sets

:formula_293

== History and relation to other fields ==

The low-dimensional cohomology of a group was classically studied in other guises, well before the notion of group cohomology was formulated in 1943–45. The first theorem of the subject can be identified as Hilbert&#x27;s Theorem 90 in 1897; this was recast into &quot;Emmy Noether&#x27;s equations&quot; in Galois theory (an appearance of cocycles for formula_84). The idea of &quot;factor sets&quot; for the extension problem for groups (connected with formula_88) arose in the work of Otto Hölder (1893), in Issai Schur&#x27;s 1904 study of projective representations, in Otto Schreier&#x27;s 1926 treatment, and in Richard Brauer&#x27;s 1928 study of simple algebras and the Brauer group. A fuller discussion of this history may be found in .

In 1941, while studying formula_296 (which plays a special role in groups), Heinz Hopf discovered what is now called Hopf&#x27;s integral homology formula , which is identical to Schur&#x27;s formula for the Schur multiplier of a finite, finitely presented group:

:formula_297

where formula_298 and &quot;F&quot; is a free group.

Hopf&#x27;s result led to the independent discovery of group cohomology by several groups in 1943-45: Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in the United States ; Hopf and Beno Eckmann in Switzerland; Hans Freudenthal in the Netherlands ; and Dmitry Faddeev in the Soviet Union (, ). The situation was chaotic because communication between these countries was difficult during World War II.

From a topological point of view, the homology and cohomology of G was first defined as the homology and cohomology of a model for the topological classifying space &quot;BG&quot; as discussed above. In practice, this meant using topology to produce the chain complexes used in formal algebraic definitions. From a module-theoretic point of view this was integrated into the Cartan–Eilenberg theory of homological algebra in the early 1950s.

The application in algebraic number theory to class field theory provided theorems valid for general Galois extensions (not just abelian extensions). The cohomological part of class field theory was axiomatized as the theory of class formations. In turn, this led to the notion of Galois cohomology and étale cohomology (which builds on it) . Some refinements in the theory post-1960 have been made, such as continuous cocycles and John Tate&#x27;s redefinition, but the basic outlines remain the same. This is a large field, and now basic in the theories of algebraic groups.

The analogous theory for Lie algebras, called Lie algebra cohomology, was first developed in the late 1940s, by Claude Chevalley and Eilenberg, and Jean-Louis Koszul . It is formally similar, using the corresponding definition of &quot;invariant&quot; for the action of a Lie algebra. It is much applied in representation theory, and is closely connected with the BRST quantization of theoretical physics.

Group cohomology theory also has a direct application in condensed matter physics. Just like group theory being the mathematical foundation of spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, group cohomology theory is the mathematical foundation of a class of quantum states of matter—short-range entangled states with symmetry. Short-range entangled states with symmetry are also known as symmetry-protected topological states.

<doc id="248639" wikidata="Q1050868" url="?curid=248639" title="Cathay">
<text>Cathay ( ) is a historical name for China that was used in Europe. During the early modern period, the term &quot;Cathay&quot; initially evolved as a term referring to what is now Northern China, completely separate and distinct from &quot;China&quot;, which was a reference to southern China. As knowledge of East Asia increased, Cathay came to be seen as the same polity as China as a whole. The term &quot;Cathay&quot; became a poetic name for China.

The name &quot;Cathay&quot; originates from the term &quot;Khitan&quot; (), a para-Mongolic nomadic people who ruled the Liao dynasty in northern China from 916 to 1125, and who later migrated west after they were overthrown by the Jin dynasty to form the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty) for another century thereafter. Originally, this name was the name applied by Central and Western Asians and Europeans to northern China; the name was also used in Marco Polo&#x27;s book on his travels in Yuan dynasty China (he referred to southern China as &quot;Mangi&quot;). Odoric of Pordenone (d. 1331) also writes about Cathay and the Khan in his travelbooks from his journey before 1331, perhaps 1321–1330.

== History ==

The term &quot;Cathay&quot; came from the name for the Khitans. A form of the name &quot;Cathai&quot; is attested in a Uyghur Manichaean document describing the external people circa 1000. The Khitans refer to themselves as Qidan (Khitan small script: ; ), but in the language of the ancient Uyghurs the final -n or -ń became -y, and this form may have been the source of the name &quot;Khitai&quot; for later Muslim writers. This version of the name was then introduced to medieval and early modern Europe via Muslim and Russian sources.

The Khitans were known to Muslim Central Asia: in 1026, the Ghaznavid court (in Ghazna, in today&#x27;s Afghanistan) was visited by envoys from the Liao ruler, he was described as a &quot;Qatā Khan&quot;, i.e. the ruler of &quot;Qatā&quot;; &quot;Qatā&quot; or &quot;Qitā&quot; appears in writings of al-Biruni and Abu Said Gardezi in the following decades. The Persian scholar and administrator Nizam al-Mulk (1018–1092) mentions &quot;Khita&quot; and &quot;China&quot; in his &quot;Book on the Administration of the State&quot;, apparently as two separate countries (presumably, referring to the Liao and Song Empires, respectively).

The name&#x27;s currency in the Muslim world survived the replacement of the Khitan Liao dynasty with the Jurchen Jin dynasty in the early 12th century. When describing the fall of the Jin Empire to the Mongols (1234), Persian history described the conquered country as &quot;Khitāy&quot; or &quot;Djerdaj Khitāy&quot; (i.e., &quot;Jurchen Cathay&quot;). The Mongols themselves, in their &quot;Secret History&quot; (13th century) talk of both Khitans and Kara-Khitans.

In about 1340 Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, a merchant from Florence, compiled the &quot;Pratica della mercatura&quot;, a guide about trade in China, a country he called &quot;Cathay&quot;, noting the size of Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) and how merchants could exchange silver for Chinese paper money that could be used to buy luxury items such as silk.

Words related to Khitay are still used in many Turkic and Slavic languages to refer to China. The ethnonym derived from Khitay in the Uyghur language for Han Chinese is considered pejorative by both its users and its referents, and the PRC authorities have attempted to ban its use. The term also strongly connotes Uyghur nationalism.

== Cathay and Mangi ==
As European and Arab travelers started reaching the Mongol Empire, they described the Mongol-controlled Northern China as &quot;Cathay&quot; in a number of spelling variants. The name occurs in the writings of Giovanni da Pian del Carpine (c. 1180–1252) (as &quot;Kitaia&quot;), and William of Rubruck (c. 1220–c. 1293) (as &quot;Cataya&quot; or &quot;Cathaia&quot;). &quot;Travels in the Land of Kublai Khan&quot; by Marco Polo has a story called &quot;The Road to Cathay&quot;. Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, ibn Battuta, and Marco Polo all referred to Northern China as Cathay, while Southern China, ruled by the Song dynasty, was &quot;Mangi&quot;, &quot;Manzi&quot;, &quot;Chin&quot;, or &quot;Sin&quot;. The word &quot;Manzi&quot; (蠻子) or &quot;Mangi&quot; is a derogatory term in Chinese meaning &quot;barbarians of the south&quot; (&quot;Man&quot; was used to describe unsinicised Southern China in its earlier periods), and would therefore not have been used by the Chinese to describe themselves or their own country, but it was adopted by the Mongols to describe the people and country of Southern China. The name for South China commonly used on Western medieval maps was &quot;Mangi&quot;, a term still used in maps in the 16th century.

== Identifying China as Cathay ==

The division of China into northern and southern parts ruled by, in succession, the Liao, Jin and Yuan dynasties in the north, and the Song dynasty in the south, ended in the late 13th century with the conquest of southern China by the Yuan dynasty.

While Central Asia had long known China under names similar to &quot;Cathay&quot;, that country was known to the peoples of Southeast Asia and India under names similar to &quot;China&quot; (cf. e.g. &quot;Cina&quot; in modern Malay). Meanwhile, in China itself, people usually referred to the realm in which they lived on the name of the ruling dynasty, e.g. &quot;Da Ming Guo&quot; (&quot;Great Ming state&quot;) and &quot;Da Qing Guo&quot; (&quot;Great Qing state&quot;), or as &quot;Zhongguo&quot; (中國, lit. &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; or &quot;Central State&quot;); see also Names of China for details.

When the Portuguese reached Southeast Asia (Afonso de Albuquerque conquering Malacca in 1511) and the southern coast of China (Jorge Álvares reaching the Pearl River estuary in 1513), they started calling the country by the name used in South and Southeast Asia. It was not immediately clear to the Europeans whether this &quot;China&quot; is the same country as &quot;Cathay&quot; known from Marco Polo. Therefore, it would not be uncommon for 16th-century maps to apply the label &quot;China&quot; just to the coastal region already well known to the Europeans (e.g., just Guangdong on Abraham Ortelius&#x27; 1570 map), and to place the mysterious Cathay somewhere inland.

It was a small group of Jesuits, led by Matteo Ricci who, being able both to travel throughout China and to read, learned about the country from Chinese books and from conversation with people of all walks of life. During his first fifteen years in China (1583–1598) Matteo Ricci formed a strong suspicion that Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Cathay&quot; is simply the Tatar (i.e., Mongol) name for the
country he was in, i.e. China. Ricci supported his arguments by numerous correspondences between Marco Polo&#x27;s accounts and his own observations:

* The River &quot;Yangtze&quot; divides the empire into two halves, with nine provinces (&quot;kingdoms&quot;) south of the river and six to the north;
* Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Cathay&quot; was just south of &quot;Tartary&quot;, and Ricci learned that there was no other country between the Ming Empire and &quot;Tartary&quot; (i.e., the lands of Mongols and Manchus).
* People in China had not heard of any place called &quot;Cathay&quot;.

Most importantly, when the Jesuits first arrived to Beijing 1598, they also met a number of &quot;Mohammedans&quot; or &quot;Arabian Turks&quot; – visitors or immigrants from the Muslim countries to the west of China, who told Ricci that now they &quot;were&quot; living in the Great Cathay. This all made them quite convinced that Cathay was indeed China.

China-based Jesuits promptly informed their colleagues in Goa (Portuguese India) and Europe about their discovery of the Cathay–China identity. This was stated e.g. in a 1602 letter of Ricci&#x27;s comrade Diego de Pantoja, which was published in Europe along with other Jesuits&#x27; letters in 1605. The Jesuits in India, however, were not convinced, because, according to their informants (merchants who visited the Mughal capitals Agra and Lahore), Cathay – a country that could be reached via Kashgar – had a large Christian population, while the Jesuits in China had not found any Christians there.
In retrospect, the Central Asian Muslim informants&#x27; idea of the Ming China being a heavily Christian country may be explained by numerous similarities between Christian and Buddhist ecclesiastical rituals – from having sumptuous statuary and ecclesiastical robes to Gregorian chant – which would make the two religions appear externally similar to a Muslim merchant. This may also have been the genesis of the Prester John myth.

To resolve the &quot;China&quot;–&quot;Cathay&quot; controversy, the India Jesuits sent a Portuguese lay brother, Bento de Góis, on an overland expedition north and east, with the goal of reaching Cathay and finding out once and for all whether it is China or some other country. Góis spent almost three years (1603–1605) crossing Afghanistan, Badakhshan, Kashgaria, and Kingdom of Cialis with Muslim trade caravans. In 1605, in Cialis, he, too, became convinced that his destination &quot;is&quot; China, as he met the members of a caravan returning from Beijing to Kashgar, who told them about staying in the same Beijing inn with Portuguese Jesuits. (In fact, those were the same very &quot;Saracens&quot; who had, a few months earlier, confirmed it to Ricci that they were in &quot;Cathay&quot;). De Góis died in Suzhou, Gansu – the first Ming China city he reached – while waiting for an entry permit to proceed toward Beijing; but, in the words of Henry Yule, it was his expedition that made &quot;&quot;Cathay&quot;... finally disappear from view, leaving &quot;China&quot; only in the mouths and minds of men&quot;.
Ricci&#x27;s and de Gois&#x27; conclusion was not, however, completely convincing for everybody in Europe yet.
Samuel Purchas, who in 1625 published an English translation of Pantoja&#x27;s letter and Ricci&#x27;s account, thought that perhaps Cathay still can be found somewhere north of China. In this period, many cartographers were placing Cathay on the Pacific coast, north of Beijing (Pekin) which was already well known to Europeans. The borders drawn on some of these maps would first make Cathay the northeastern section of China (e.g. 1595 map by Gerardus Mercator), or, later, a region separated by China by the Great Wall and possibly some mountains and/or wilderness (as in a 1610 map by Jodocus Hondius, or a 1626 map by John Speed).
J. J. L. Duyvendak hypothesized that it was the ignorance of the fact that &quot;China&quot; is the mighty &quot;Cathay&quot; of Marco Polo that allowed the Dutch governor of East Indies Jan Pieterszoon Coen to embark on an &quot;unfortunate&quot; (for the Dutch) policy of treating the Ming Empire as &quot;merely another &#x27;oriental&#x27; kingdom&quot;.
The last nail into the coffin of the idea of there being a Cathay as a country separate from China was, perhaps, driven in 1654, when the Dutch Orientalist Jacobus Golius met with the China-based Jesuit Martino Martini, who was passing through Leyden. Golius knew no Chinese, but he was familiar with &quot;Zij-i Ilkhani&quot;, a work by the Persian astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, completed in 1272, in which he described the Chinese (&quot;Cathayan&quot;) calendar. Upon meeting Martini, Golius started reciting the names of the 12 divisions into which, according to Nasir al-Din, the &quot;Cathayans&quot; were dividing the day – and Martini, who of course knew no Persian, was able to continue the list. The names of the 24 solar terms matched as well. The story, soon published by Martini in the &quot;Additamentum&quot; to his Atlas of China, seemed to have finally convinced most European scholars that China and Cathay were the same.

Even then, some people still viewed Cathay as distinct from China, as did John Milton in the 11th Book of his &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667).

In 1939, Hisao Migo (, a Japanese botanist) published a paper describing &quot;Iris cathayensis&quot; (meaning &quot;Chinese iris&quot;) in the &quot;Journal of the Shanghai Science Institute&quot;.

== Etymological progression ==

Below is the etymological progression from &quot;Khitan&quot; to Cathay as the word travelled westward:

* Classical Mongolian: (cf. modern Mongolian )
* Uyghur: ()
* Persian: ()
* Kyrgyz: ()
* Kazakh: , , 
* Kazan Tatar: ()
* Russian: ()
* Ukrainian: ()
* Belarusian: ()
* Bulgarian: ()
* Georgian: () (archaic or obsolete)
* Uzbek: ()
* Polish: 
* Slovenian: ()
* Croatian: 
* Medieval Latin: , 
* Italian: 
* Spanish: 
* Portuguese: or 
* French, English, German, Dutch, Scandinavian: Cathay

In many Turkic and Slavic languages a form of &quot;Cathay&quot; (e.g., , ) remains the usual modern name for China. In Javanese, the word (, ) exists, and it refers to &quot;East Asian&quot;, literally meaning &quot;dwarf&quot; or &quot;short-legged&quot; in today&#x27;s language.

In Uyghur, the word &quot;Xitay (Hitay)&quot; is used as a derogatory term for Ethnic Han Chinese.

== Use in English ==

In the English language, the word &quot;Cathay&quot; was sometimes used for China, although increasingly only in a poetic sense, until the 19th century, when it was completely replaced by &quot;China&quot;. Demonyms for the people of Cathay (i.e., Chinese people) were &quot;Cathayan&quot; and &quot;Cataian&quot;. The terms &quot;China&quot; and &quot;Cathay&quot; have histories of approximately equal length in English. &quot;Cathay&quot; is still used poetically. The Hong Kong flag-bearing airline is named &quot;Cathay Pacific&quot;. One of the largest commercial banks of Taiwan is named &quot;Cathay United Bank&quot;.

The novel &quot;Creation&quot; by Gore Vidal uses the name in reference to &quot;those states between the Yangtze and the Yellow Rivers&quot; as the novel is set in the fifth and sixth centuries B.C. Ezra Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cathay&quot; (1915) is a collection of classical Chinese poems translated freely into English verse.

In Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Hyborian Age stories (including the tales of Conan the Barbarian), the analog of China is called &quot;Khitai&quot;.

In &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot;, a fantastical reimagination of the world used as a setting for various novels and games produced by Games Workshop, Grand Cathay is the largest human empire, situated in the far east of the setting and based on medieval China.

== In the names of organized entities ==

&quot;Cathay&quot; is more prevalent in proper terms, such as in &quot;Cathay Pacific Airways&quot; or &quot;Cathay Hotel&quot;.

Cathay Bank is a bank with multiple branches throughout the United States and other countries.

Cathay Cineplexes is a cinema operator in Singapore operated by mm2 Asia, acquired from the Cathay Organisation.

Cathay United Bank and Cathay Life Insurance are, respectively, a financial services company and an insurance company, both located in Taiwan.

<text>Erlenbach () is a municipality in the district of Meilen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

==History==
Erlenbach is first mentioned in 981 as &quot;Liber Heremi&quot; though this identification is questionable. Between 1173-90 it was mentioned as &quot;Erlibach&quot;.

Archeological digs have shown that there were settlements in Erlenbach more than 5,000 years ago. During Roman times an important road passed through what is now Erlenbach. The Alemanni settled in this village in the 6th century. In 981 the name &quot;Erlibach&quot; was first mentioned when the monastery of Einsiedeln acquired the land. Around 1400 the city of Zürich bought the land. Two castles &quot;Balp&quot; and &quot;Dachsberg&quot; are mentioned in old writings, but there is no evidence left.
On 6 October 1445 a small battle (&quot;Schlacht bey Ehrlibach&quot;) took place in Erlenbach. Troops from Zürich defeated wine thieves. In 1798 the village housed in turn French, Austrian, Russian, and eventually again French troops.

Until the middle of the 19th century, Erlenbach remained a small village with less than 1000 inhabitants, mainly engaged in wine growing. In 1835 the first school was built, but it had just two classrooms.

After World War II the village was very sought after and the population grew dramatically.

==Geography==
Erlenbach has an area of . Of this area, 25.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while 26.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 47% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (0.7%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). housing and buildings made up 37% of the total area, while transportation infrastructure made up the rest (10.1%). Of the total unproductive area, water (streams and lakes) made up 0.3% of the area. 46.3% of the total municipal area was undergoing some type of construction.

It is located on the north bank of the lake of Zürich, opposite Thalwil. The village is located on the Erlen stream (&quot;Erlen Bach&quot;) and along the Zürich-Rapperswil road. It includes the village and the outlying sections of Wyden, Winkel, Isler, Bindschädler and Lerchenberg.

==Demographics==

Erlenbach has a population (as of ) of . , 17.1% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. the gender distribution of the population was 47.8% male and 52.2% female. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 19.5%. Most of the population () speaks German (86.3%), with English being second most common ( 2.8%) and Italian being third ( 2.7%).

In the 2007 election the most popular party was the FDP which received 30.2% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SVP (27.9%), the SPS (16.1%) and the CSP (10.1%).

The age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0–19 years old) make up 20.4% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 62.2% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 17.4%. About 82.3% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;). There are 2041 households in Erlenbach.

Erlenbach has an unemployment rate of 1.59%. , there were 60 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 10 businesses involved in this sector. 204 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 33 businesses in this sector. 1131 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 227 businesses in this sector. 50% of the working population were employed full-time, and 50% were employed part-time.

 there were 1419 Catholics and 2146 Protestants in Erlenbach. In the 2000 census, religion was broken down into several smaller categories. From the , 47% were some type of Protestant, with 45.9% belonging to the Swiss Reformed Church and 1.1% belonging to other Protestant churches. 29.2% of the population were Catholic. Of the rest of the population, 0% were Muslim, 5.4% belonged to another religion (not listed), 2.4% did not give a religion, and 15.7% were atheist or agnostic.

The historical population is given in the following table:
== Transportation ==
The development of a railway link between Zürich and Rapperswil had a great impact on the village. Bit by bit the village turned from an agricultural village to part of Zürich&#x27;s agglomeration. There are two stations within the municipality, Erlenbach ZH station and Winkel am Zürichsee station. Both are stops of the S-Bahn Zürich on the lines S6 and S16. Tourist boat trips, run by the Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft, also sail from Zürich and Rapperswil.

== Cultural Heritage ==
Located on &quot;Zürichsee&quot; lakeshore, Erlenbach–Winkel is part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps&quot;, and the settlement is also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a &quot;Class object&quot;. Because the lake has grown in size over time, the original piles are now around to under the water level of .

<doc id="248669" wikidata="Q3745367" url="?curid=248669" title="Tapir">
<text>Tapirs ( ) are large, herbivorous mammals belonging to the family Tapiridae. They are similar in shape to a pig, with a short, prehensile nose trunk (proboscis). Tapirs inhabit jungle and forest regions of South and Central America and Southeast Asia. They are one of three extant branches of Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), alongside equines and rhinoceroses. Only a single genus, &quot;Tapirus&quot;, is currently extant. Tapirs migrated into South America during the Pleistocene epoch from North America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama as part of the Great American Interchange. Tapirs were formerly present across North America, but became extinct in the region at the end of the Late Pleistocene, around 12,000 years ago.

== Name ==
The term &quot;tapir&quot; comes from the Portuguese-language words , , which themselves trace their origins back to Old Tupi, specifically the term . This word, according to Eduardo de Almeida Navarro, referred in a more precise manner to the species &quot;Tapirus terrestris&quot;.

==Species==
There are four widely recognized extant species of tapir, all in the genus Tapirus of the family Tapiridae. They are the South American tapir, the Malayan tapir, Baird&#x27;s tapir, and the mountain tapir. In 2013, a group of researchers said they had identified a fifth species of tapir, the kabomani tapir. However, the existence of the kabomani tapir as a distinct species has been widely disputed, and recent genetic evidence further suggests that it actually is part of the species South American tapir.&quot;

=== Extant species ===
The four species are all classified on the IUCN Red List as Endangered or Vulnerable. The tapirs have a number of extinct relatives in the superfamily Tapiroidea. The closest extant relatives of the tapirs are the other odd-toed ungulates, which include horses, wild asses, zebras and rhinoceroses.

=== Extinct species ===
During the Late Pleistocene, several other species inhabited North America, including &quot;Tapirus veroensis&quot;, native to the southern and eastern United States (with its northernmost records being New York State), and &quot;Tapirus merriami&quot; and &quot;Tapirus californicus&quot;, native to Western North America. These became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event around 12,000 years ago, along with most of the other large mammals of the Americas, co-inciding with the first arrival of humans to the continent. &quot;Tapirus augustus&quot; (formerly placed in &quot;Megatapirus&quot;), native to Southeast and East Asia, substantially larger than the Malayan tapir, also became extinct at some point during the Late Pleistocene. Many primitive tapirs were originally classified under &quot;Palaeotapirus&quot; including members of &quot;Paratapirus&quot; and &quot;Plesiotapirus&quot;, but the original diagnostic material of the genus was too poor to characterize, leading to included species being moved to new genera.

==General appearance==
Size varies between types, but most tapirs are about long, stand about high at the shoulder, and weigh between . Their coats are short and range in colour from reddish brown, to grey, to nearly black, with the notable exceptions of the Malayan tapir, which has a white, saddle-shaped marking on its back, and the mountain tapir, which has longer, woolly fur. All tapirs have oval, white-tipped ears, rounded, protruding rumps with stubby tails, and splayed, hooved toes, with four toes on the front feet and three on the hind feet, which help them to walk on muddy and soft ground. Baby tapirs of all types have striped-and-spotted coats for camouflage.

Females have a single pair of mammary glands, and males have long penises relative to their body size.

==Physical characteristics==
The proboscis of the tapir is a highly flexible organ, able to move in all directions, allowing the animals to grab foliage that would otherwise be out of reach. Tapirs often exhibit the flehmen response, a posture in which they raise their snouts and show their teeth to detect scents. This response is frequently exhibited by bulls sniffing for signs of other males or females in oestrus in the area. The length of the proboscis varies among species; Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and Brazilian tapirs have the shortest. The evolution of tapir probosces, made up almost entirely of soft tissues rather than bony internal structures, gives the Tapiridae skull a unique form in comparison to other perissodactyls, with a larger sagittal crest, orbits positioned more rostrally, a posteriorly telescoped cranium, and a more elongated and retracted nasoincisive incisure.

Tapirs have brachyodont, or low-crowned teeth, that lack cementum. Their dental formula is: 
Totaling 42 to 44 teeth, this dentition is closer to that of equids, which may differ by one less canine, than their other perissodactyl relatives, rhinoceroses. Their incisors are chisel-shaped, with the third large, conical upper incisor separated by a short gap from the considerably smaller canine. A much longer gap is found between the canines and premolars, the first of which may be absent. Tapirs are lophodonts, and their cheek teeth have distinct lophs (ridges) between protocones, paracones, metacones and hypocones.

Tapirs have brown eyes, often with a bluish cast to them, which has been identified as corneal cloudiness, a condition most commonly found in Malayan tapirs. The exact etiology is unknown, but the cloudiness may be caused by excessive exposure to light or by trauma. However, the tapir&#x27;s sensitive ears and strong sense of smell help to compensate for deficiencies in vision.

Tapirs have simple stomachs and are hindgut fermenters that ferment digested food in a large cecum.

==Life cycle==
Young tapirs reach sexual maturity between three and five years of age, with females maturing earlier than males. Under good conditions, a healthy female tapir can reproduce every two years; a single young, called a calf, is born after a gestation of about 13 months. The natural lifespan of a tapir is about 25 to 30 years, both in the wild and in zoos. Apart from mothers and their young offspring, tapirs lead almost exclusively solitary lives.

==Behaviour==
Although they frequently live in dryland forests, tapirs with access to rivers spend a good deal of time in and under water, feeding on soft vegetation, taking refuge from predators, and cooling off during hot periods. Tapirs near a water source will swim, sink to the bottom, and walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies. Along with freshwater lounging, tapirs often wallow in mud pits, which helps to keep them cool and free of insects.

In the wild, the tapir&#x27;s diet consists of fruit, berries, and leaves, particularly young, tender vegetation. Tapirs will spend many of their waking hours foraging along well-worn trails, snouts to the ground in search of food. Baird&#x27;s tapirs have been observed to eat around 40 kg (85 lb) of vegetation in one day.

Tapirs are largely nocturnal and crepuscular, although the smaller mountain tapir of the Andes is generally more active during the day than its congeners. They have monocular vision.

Copulation may occur in or out of water. In captivity, mating pairs will often copulate several times during oestrus. Intromission lasts between 10 and 20 minutes.

==Habitat, predation, and vulnerability==

Adult tapirs are large enough to have few natural predators, and the thick skin on the backs of their necks helps to protect them from threats such as jaguars, crocodiles, anacondas, and tigers. The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, considering their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; the Brazilian tapir is classified as vulnerable, and Baird&#x27;s tapir, the mountain tapir, and the Malayan tapir are endangered. According to 2022 study published in the &quot;Neotropical Biology and Conservation&quot;, the lowland tapir in the Atlantic Forest is at risk of complete extinction as a result of anthropogenic pressures, in particular hunting, deforestation and population isolation.

==Evolution and natural history==
Tapirs originated from the &quot;tapiroids&quot;, a group of primitive perissodactyls that inhabited North America and Asia during the Eocene epoch, with tapirs probably originating from the family Helaletidae. The oldest known members of the family Tapiridae such as &quot;Protapirus&quot; are known from the Early Oligocene of Europe. The oldest representatives of the modern genus &quot;Tapirus&quot; appeared in Europe during the Mid-Miocene, with &quot;Tapirus&quot; dispersing into Asia and North America by the late Miocene. &quot;Tapirus&quot; became extinct in Europe around the end of the Pliocene. Tapirs dispersed into South America during Pleistocene as part of the Great American Biotic Interchange with their oldest records on the continent dating to around 2.6-1 million years ago.

Approximate divergence times based on a 2013 analysis of mtDNA sequences are 0.5 Ma for &quot;T. kabomani&quot; and the &quot;T. terrestris&quot;–&quot;T. pinchaque&quot; clade, 5 Ma for &quot;T. bairdii&quot; and the three South American tapirs, and 9 Ma for the branching of &quot;T. indicus&quot;. &quot;T. pinchaque&quot; arises from within a paraphyletic complex of &quot;T. terrestris&quot; populations.

==Genetics==

The species of tapir have the following chromosomal numbers:

The Malayan tapir, the species most isolated geographically and genetically, has a significantly smaller number of chromosomes and has been found to share fewer homologies with the three types of American tapirs. A number of conserved autosomes (13 between karyotypes of Baird&#x27;s tapir and the South American tapir, and 15 between Baird&#x27;s and the mountain tapir) have also been found in the American species that are not found in the Asian animal. However, geographic proximity is not an absolute predictor of genetic similarity; for instance, G-banded preparations have revealed Malayan, Baird&#x27;s and South American tapirs have identical X chromosomes, while mountain tapirs are separated by a heterochromatic addition/deletion.

Lack of genetic diversity in tapir populations has become a major source of concern for conservationists. Habitat loss has isolated already small populations of wild tapirs, putting each group in greater danger of dying out completely. Even in zoos, genetic diversity is limited; all captive mountain tapirs, for example, are descended from only two founder individuals.

Hybrids of Baird&#x27;s and the South American tapirs were bred at the San Francisco Zoo around 1969 and later produced a backcross second generation.

==Conservation==
A number of conservation projects have been started around the world. The Tapir Specialist Group, a unit of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, strives to conserve biological diversity by stimulating, developing, and conducting practical programs to study, save, restore, and manage the four species of tapir and their remaining habitats in Central and South America and Southeast Asia.

The Baird&#x27;s Tapir Project of Costa Rica, begun in 1994, is the longest ongoing tapir project in the world. It involves placing radio collars on tapirs in Costa Rica&#x27;s Corcovado National Park to study their social systems and habitat preferences.

The Lowland Lowland Tapir Conservation Initiative is a conservation and research organization founded by Patrícia Medici, focused on tapir conservation in Brazil.

==Attacks on humans==
Tapirs are generally shy, but when scared they can defend themselves with their very powerful jaws. In 1998, a zookeeper in Oklahoma City was mauled and had an arm severed after opening the door to a female tapir&#x27;s enclosure to push food inside (the tapir&#x27;s two-month-old baby also occupied the cage at the time). In 2006, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez Echandi (who was then the Costa Rican Environmental Minister) became lost in the Corcovado National Park and was found by a search party with a &quot;nasty bite&quot; from a wild tapir. In 2013, a two-year-old girl suffered stomach and arm injuries after being mauled by a South American tapir in Dublin Zoo during a supervised experience in the tapir enclosure. Dublin Zoo pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety regulations and was ordered to pay €5,000 to charity. However, such examples are rare; for the most part, tapirs are likely to avoid confrontation in favour of running from predators, hiding, or, if possible, submerging themselves in nearby water until a threat is gone.

Frank Buck wrote about an attack by a tapir in 1926, which he described in his book, &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot;.

== Folklore ==
Tapirs feature in the folklore of several cultures around the world. In Japan, tapirs are associated with the mythological Baku, believed to ward off nightmares. In South America, tapirs are associated with the creation of the earth.

<doc id="248671" wikidata="Q191835" url="?curid=248671" title="Gluconeogenesis">
<text>Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a metabolic pathway that results in the biosynthesis of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates. It is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms. In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of the kidneys. It is one of two primary mechanisms – the other being degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis) – used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood sugar levels, avoiding low levels (hypoglycemia). In ruminants, because dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc. In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise.

In humans, substrates for gluconeogenesis may come from any non-carbohydrate sources that can be converted to pyruvate or intermediates of glycolysis (see figure). For the breakdown of proteins, these substrates include glucogenic amino acids (although not ketogenic amino acids); from breakdown of lipids (such as triglycerides), they include glycerol, odd-chain fatty acids (although not even-chain fatty acids, see below); and from other parts of metabolism that includes lactate from the Cori cycle. Under conditions of prolonged fasting, acetone derived from ketone bodies can also serve as a substrate, providing a pathway from fatty acids to glucose. Although most gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver, the relative contribution of gluconeogenesis by the kidney is increased in diabetes and prolonged fasting.

The gluconeogenesis pathway is highly endergonic until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP, effectively making the process exergonic. For example, the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed spontaneously. These ATPs are supplied from fatty acid catabolism via beta oxidation.

==Precursors==

In humans the main gluconeogenic precursors are lactate, glycerol (which is a part of the triglyceride molecule), alanine and glutamine. Altogether, they account for over 90% of the overall gluconeogenesis.
Other glucogenic amino acids and all citric acid cycle intermediates (through conversion to oxaloacetate) can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis. Generally, human consumption of gluconeogenic substrates in food does not result in increased gluconeogenesis.

In ruminants, propionate is the principal gluconeogenic substrate. In nonruminants, including human beings, propionate arises from the β-oxidation of odd-chain and branched-chain fatty acids, and is a (relatively minor) substrate for gluconeogenesis.

Lactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the Cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to generate glucose. Transamination or deamination of amino acids facilitates entering of their carbon skeleton into the cycle directly (as pyruvate or oxaloacetate), or indirectly via the citric acid cycle. The contribution of Cori cycle lactate to overall glucose production increases with fasting duration. Specifically, after 12, 20, and 40 hours of fasting by human volunteers, the contribution of Cori cycle lactate to gluconeogenesis was 41%, 71%, and 92%, respectively.

Whether even-chain fatty acids can be converted into glucose in animals has been a longstanding question in biochemistry. Odd-chain fatty acids can be oxidized to yield acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, the latter serving as a precursor to succinyl-CoA, which can be converted to oxaloacetate and enter into gluconeogenesis. In contrast, even-chain fatty acids are oxidized to yield only acetyl-CoA, whose entry into gluconeogenesis requires the presence of a glyoxylate cycle (also known as glyoxylate shunt) to produce four-carbon dicarboxylic acid precursors. The glyoxylate shunt comprises two enzymes, malate synthase and isocitrate lyase, and is present in fungi, plants, and bacteria. Despite some reports of glyoxylate shunt enzymatic activities detected in animal tissues, genes encoding both enzymatic functions have only been found in nematodes, in which they exist as a single bi-functional enzyme. Genes coding for malate synthase alone (but not isocitrate lyase) have been identified in other animals including arthropods, echinoderms, and even some vertebrates. Mammals found to possess the malate synthase gene include monotremes (platypus) and marsupials (opossum), but not placental mammals.

The existence of the glyoxylate cycle in humans has not been established, and it is widely held that fatty acids cannot be converted to glucose in humans directly. Carbon-14 has been shown to end up in glucose when it is supplied in fatty acids, but this can be expected from the incorporation of labelled atoms derived from acetyl-CoA into citric acid cycle intermediates which are interchangeable with those derived from other physiological sources, such as glucogenic amino acids. In the absence of other glucogenic sources, the 2-carbon acetyl-CoA derived from the oxidation of fatty acids cannot produce a net yield of glucose via the citric acid cycle, since an equivalent two carbon atoms are released as carbon dioxide during the cycle. During ketosis, however, acetyl-CoA from fatty acids yields ketone bodies, including acetone, and up to ~60% of acetone may be oxidized in the liver to the pyruvate precursors acetol and methylglyoxal. Thus ketone bodies derived from fatty acids could account for up to 11% of gluconeogenesis during starvation. Catabolism of fatty acids also produces energy in the form of ATP that is necessary for the gluconeogenesis pathway.

== Location ==
In mammals, gluconeogenesis has been believed to be restricted to the liver, the kidney, the intestine, and muscle, but recent evidence indicates gluconeogenesis occurring in astrocytes of the brain. These organs use somewhat different gluconeogenic precursors. The liver preferentially uses lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids (especially alanine) while the kidney preferentially uses lactate, glutamine and glycerol. Lactate from the Cori cycle is quantitatively the largest source of substrate for gluconeogenesis, especially for the kidney. The liver uses both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to produce glucose, whereas the kidney only uses gluconeogenesis. After a meal, the liver shifts to glycogen synthesis, whereas the kidney increases gluconeogenesis. The intestine uses mostly glutamine and glycerol.

Propionate is the principal substrate for gluconeogenesis in the ruminant liver, and the ruminant liver may make increased use of gluconeogenic amino acids (e.g., alanine) when glucose demand is increased. The capacity of liver cells to use lactate for gluconeogenesis declines from the preruminant stage to the ruminant stage in calves and lambs. In sheep kidney tissue, very high rates of gluconeogenesis from propionate have been observed.

In all species, the formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates is restricted to the mitochondrion, and the enzymes that convert Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) to glucose-6-phosphate are found in the cytosol. The location of the enzyme that links these two parts of gluconeogenesis by converting oxaloacetate to PEP – PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) – is variable by species: it can be found entirely within the mitochondria, entirely within the cytosol, or dispersed evenly between the two, as it is in humans. Transport of PEP across the mitochondrial membrane is accomplished by dedicated transport proteins; however no such proteins exist for oxaloacetate. Therefore, in species that lack intra-mitochondrial PEPCK, oxaloacetate must be converted into malate or aspartate, exported from the mitochondrion, and converted back into oxaloacetate in order to allow gluconeogenesis to continue.
==Pathway==
Gluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The pathway will begin in either the liver or kidney, in the mitochondria or cytoplasm of those cells, this being dependent on the substrate being used. Many of the reactions are the reverse of steps found in glycolysis.
* Gluconeogenesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of oxaloacetate by the carboxylation of pyruvate. This reaction also requires one molecule of ATP, and is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase. This enzyme is stimulated by high levels of acetyl-CoA (produced in β-oxidation in the liver) and inhibited by high levels of ADP and glucose.
* Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate using NADH, a step required for its transportation out of the mitochondria.
* Malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate using NAD+ in the cytosol, where the remaining steps of gluconeogenesis take place.
* Oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and then phosphorylated to form phosphoenolpyruvate using the enzyme PEPCK. A molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP during this reaction.
* The next steps in the reaction are the same as reversed glycolysis. However, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase converts fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate, using one water molecule and releasing one phosphate (in glycolysis, phosphofructokinase 1 converts F6P and ATP to F1,6BP and ADP). This is also the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis.
* Glucose-6-phosphate is formed from fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucoisomerase (the reverse of step 2 in glycolysis). Glucose-6-phosphate can be used in other metabolic pathways or dephosphorylated to free glucose. Whereas free glucose can easily diffuse in and out of the cell, the phosphorylated form (glucose-6-phosphate) is locked in the cell, a mechanism by which intracellular glucose levels are controlled by cells.
* The final step in gluconeogenesis, the formation of glucose, occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase to produce glucose and release an inorganic phosphate. Like two steps prior, this step is not a simple reversal of glycolysis, in which hexokinase catalyzes the conversion of glucose and ATP into G6P and ADP. Glucose is shuttled into the cytoplasm by glucose transporters located in the endoplasmic reticulum&#x27;s membrane.
==Regulation==
While most steps in gluconeogenesis are the reverse of those found in glycolysis, three regulated and strongly endergonic reactions are replaced with more kinetically favorable reactions. Hexokinase/glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase enzymes of glycolysis are replaced with glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and PEP carboxykinase/pyruvate carboxylase. These enzymes are typically regulated by similar molecules, but with opposite results. For example, acetyl CoA and citrate activate gluconeogenesis enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, respectively), while at the same time inhibiting the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This system of reciprocal control allow glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to inhibit each other and prevents a futile cycle of synthesizing glucose to only break it down. Pyruvate kinase can be also bypassed by 86 pathways not related to gluconeogenesis, for the purpose of forming pyruvate and subsequently lactate; some of these pathways use carbon atoms originated from glucose.

The majority of the enzymes responsible for gluconeogenesis are found in the cytosol; the exceptions are mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase and, in animals, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The latter exists as an isozyme located in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol. The rate of gluconeogenesis is ultimately controlled by the action of a key enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, which is also regulated through signal transduction by cAMP and its phosphorylation.

Global control of gluconeogenesis is mediated by glucagon (&quot;released when blood glucose is low&quot;); it triggers phosphorylation of enzymes and regulatory proteins by Protein Kinase A (a cyclic AMP regulated kinase) resulting in inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis. Insulin counteracts glucagon by inhibiting gluconeogenesis. Type 2 diabetes is marked by excess glucagon and insulin resistance from the body. Insulin can no longer inhibit the gene expression of enzymes such as PEPCK which leads to increased levels of hyperglycemia in the body. The anti-diabetic drug metformin reduces blood glucose primarily through inhibition of gluconeogenesis, overcoming the failure of insulin to inhibit gluconeogenesis due to insulin resistance.

Studies have shown that the absence of hepatic glucose production has no major effect on the control of fasting plasma glucose concentration. Compensatory induction of gluconeogenesis occurs in the kidneys and intestine, driven by glucagon, glucocorticoids, and acidosis.

==Insulin resistance==
In the liver, the FOX protein FOXO6 normally promotes gluconeogenesis in the fasted state, but insulin blocks FOXO6 upon feeding. In a condition of insulin resistance, insulin fails to block FOXO6 resulting in continued gluconeogenesis even upon feeding, resulting in high blood glucose (hyperglycemia).

Insulin resistance is a common feature of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. For this reason, gluconeogenesis is a target of therapy for type 2 diabetes, such as the antidiabetic drug metformin, which inhibits gluconeogenic glucose formation, and stimulates glucose uptake by cells.

== Origins ==
Gluconeogenesis is considered one of the most ancient anabolic pathways and is likely to have been exhibited in the last universal common ancestor. Rafael F. Say and Georg Fuchs stated in 2010 that &quot;all archaeal groups as well as the deeply branching bacterial lineages contain a bifunctional fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase/phosphatase with both FBP aldolase and FBP phosphatase activity. This enzyme is missing in most other Bacteria and in Eukaryota, and is heat-stabile even in mesophilic marine Crenarchaeota&quot;. It is proposed that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase was an ancestral gluconeogenic enzyme and had preceded glycolysis. However, a prebiotic glycolysis would follow the same chemical mechanisms as gluconeogenesis, due to microscopic reversibility, and in this view would have occurred at the same time. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is shown to be nonenzymatically synthesized within a freezing solution. The synthesis is accelerated in the presence of amino acids such as glycine and lysine. Some of the other reactions of gluconeogenesis can also proceed nonenzymatically. Such chemistry could have occurred in hydrothermal environments, including temperature gradients and cycling of freezing and thawing. Mineral surfaces might have played a role in the phosphorylation of metabolic intermediates from gluconeogenesis and have to been shown to produce tetrose, hexose phosphates, and pentose from formaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and glycolaldehyde.

<text>George Frederick &quot;Buzz&quot; Beurling, (6 December 1921 – 20 May 1948) was the most successful Canadian fighter pilot and flying ace of the Second World War.

Beurling was recognized as &quot;Canada&#x27;s most famous hero of the Second World War&quot;, as &quot;The Falcon of Malta&quot; and the &quot;Knight of Malta&quot;, having been credited with shooting down 27 Axis aircraft in just 14 days over the besieged Mediterranean island. Before the war ended his official total climbed to either 31 or 31.

Beurling&#x27;s wartime service was terminated prior to war&#x27;s end, for repeated stunting and his lack of teamwork. Having found a way to potentially continue combat flying in the postwar era, Beurling was killed in a crash while attempting to deliver an aircraft to Israel.

==Early life==
George Beurling was born in 1921 in Verdun (now part of Montreal), Quebec into a religious family and was the third of five children in the family. His father, Frederick Gustav Beurling, was Swedish and a commercial artist working for the Claude Neon Company. His mother, Hetty Florence Gibbs, is of English descent and was born in the Montreal suburb of Pointe-Saint-Charles.

George Beurling began to develop an interest in flying at the age of 6 when his father built him a model aircraft. His parents wanted him to study in McGill University and become a successful commercial artist like his father. At the age of 15, George quit school and took up a job to increase his income. One year later, he had logged 150 flying hours and passed all examinations for a commercial pilot licence.

Wanting to increase his flying experience, he set out for China, hoping to join the Chinese Nationalist Air Force by crossing the US border. He was intending to head to San Francisco and work for some while in China and later sign up for the job. Eventually, he was arrested as an immigrant at the border and was repatriated back home. He first took the controls of an aircraft in 1933, and was flying solo by 1938. He left school to work for an air freight company in Gravenhurst, Ontario, and soon gained a commercial licence. Beurling joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1940.

==Second World War==
With the outbreak of war, Beurling tried to join the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), but his lack of academic qualifications led to his rejection. He then tried to join the Finnish Air Force (which was fighting the Soviets in the Winter War), but could not get his parents&#x27; permission. Instead, Beurling sailed across the Atlantic on a convoy, landing in Glasgow, intending to enlist in the RAF. Unfortunately, he had forgotten his birth certificate and had to return to Canada. In September 1940, after he had survived the return trip, the RAF accepted him as a pilot.

===Joining the RAF===
Having survived one or two aerial misdemeanours, Beurling reached No. 7 Operational Training Unit, at RAF Hawarden, in September 1941. Beurling demonstrated considerable skill in training. In Hawarden, he came under the influence of the great Ginger Lacey, whose score at the time stood at 27. Lacey later commented about Beurling: &quot;There are not two ways about it, he was a wonderful pilot and an even better shot.&quot;

These two factors, coupled with exceptional eyesight, were the keys to Beurling&#x27;s later success. But they did not come without effort. At Hawarden, he immersed himself in gunnery, estimation of range, deflection, bullet trail and bullet drop, until his application of these became automatic. For him, flying and shooting became one single action.

In the middle of December, he was posted as a Sergeant Pilot to 403 Squadron, a RCAF &quot;Article XV squadron&quot;, which had just moved to North Weald, Essex. He flew his first (uneventful) combat mission in a Supermarine Spitfire, on the 25th of December, 1941. Beurling remained with 403 for nearly four months, escorting bombers and flying fighter sweeps across the English Channel.

In early 1942, a change of policy by the RCAF required its squadrons to be staffed by RCAF personnel. Because Beurling had remained technically a member of the RAF, he was posted to 41 Squadron RAF in Sussex.

On 1 May 1942 41 Squadron was placed at a state of 30 minutes readiness from dawn until 09.00 and from 12.30 to participate in a Rodeo 9. Tangmere Wing was airborne from Westhampnett and Merston between 13.05 and 13.10, led by S/Ldr Thomas, and flew to Beachy Head where it rendezvoused with the 10 Group Wing at 10,000 feet at 13.30. Initially, 41 Squadron pilots saw nothing of interest on their patrol, but after they had left the French coast and after orbiting to port once off the coast just after turning home, approximately sixteen Fw 190s were seen. Sgt George Beurling later reported combat at 14,000 above Cap Gris-Nez: &quot;Squadron orbited left-handing towards the English coast. E/A were reported by their vapour trails at 9 oʼclock. I as [...] blue 4 saw 2 FW diving on the blue 3, I pulled my nose up and fired at E/A on the starboard side and blue 3 could see one on the port side. I was then hit by cannon and machine gun fire from 5 or 6 FW attacking from above and behind&quot;. After landing, his machine was so severely damaged by enemy fire that it was delivered to Flying Training School Hucknall, but after inspection recategorized as E and Struck off Charge. Beurling was allegedly not claimed as a kill by the enemy. He continued his Combat Report: &quot;I turned into the[m], seen no evasive action and FW roared overhead heading into [...] also gradually opening out as they did so. I adjusted my sights on the middle one. E/A appeared to jump momentarily and shudder, still nothing happened. My last burst of fire appeared to hit his petrol tank as his wings broke off heading up, also the fuselage breaking between the cockpit and the tail unit. I waited for signs of the pilot out but there was none. (The attack was made line astern very slightly off to the left 5o at the most). Ammo used 60 Rds Cannon, 1210 Rds .303 Browning&quot;. 

The same repeated itself on 3rd May, when he spotted a lone Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and broke from the flight to pursue it. Beurling made a climbing turn to port, following S/Ldr Feeʼs lead. Looking down, he saw an Fw 190 attacking a Spitfire below him, which he believed was 41 Squadronʼs Yellow Section. He half-rolled onto the FWʼs tail, being noticed by the target plane, which broke away and dove steeply for the French coast. Beurling went after it and closed to between 300 and 350 yards, where he opened fire with both cannons and machine guns using 120 cannon shells and 480 MG rounds. Pieces of the Fw 190 dislodged from the starboard side of the fuselage, which was followed by an explosion near the cockpit in a large orange flash. The aircraft then dove vertically in a crash toward the coast, while George remained at 17,000 feet and orbited the area. Beurling then regrouped with friendly aircraft, but as he did not witness its final fate claimed the Fw 190 probably destroyed off Cap Gris Nez at approximately 12:00. On this occasion, Beurling was reprimanded for attacking a target without permission, and became unpopular with his superiors and fellow pilots. As Red 4, finding himself alone in the sky, he made his way back across the Channel, joining up with Sgt Appleton mid-way. Counting all claims together, after Group revision, 3-1-2 Fw 190s were credited to the RAF FC pilots. These claims are disputed.

When another pilot was posted overseas, Beurling offered to take his place. Ordered to board a ship, he did not know his destination until the vessel reached Gibraltar. He was destined for No. 249 Squadron RAF, at Malta.

===Malta (1942)===
Fighter pilots played a critical role in the defence of Malta during its siege. Beurling landed on the island on 9 June, after having flown off the deck of aboard his Spitfire, during Operation Salient. His nickname on Malta was &quot;Screwball&quot;, an expletive he had a habit of using.

Beurling had a baptism by fire in the mid-morning of 12 June when, flying a Spitfire, with three other pilots from 249, the formation intercepted eight Bf 109s. Beurling claimed to have blown the tail off a Bf 109, but nobody saw it hit the ground, so he was credited with a &quot;damaged&quot;. This correction was right, because Jagdwaffe did no suffer any combat loss near Malta on that day, not even damaged fighter. After that, Beurling claimed a series of kills that had no equal. On 6 July 1942, with other pilots from 249, he attacked a formation of three Cant Z1007bis, 14 Reggiane Re.2001s and more than two dozen Macchi C.202s. He almost certainly shot down &quot;Sergente&quot; Francesco Pecchiari from 352a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. Then he claimed another Macchi that crashed near Zejtun, likely the Reggiane of &quot;Sottotenente&quot; Romano Pagliani, 152a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. During this fight, the Italians claimed two Spitfires, one by Furio Niclot Doglio (whom Beurling killed three weeks later). RAF suffered no losses, but Beurling&#x27;s aircraft was badly shot up. However he made a third claim that day, a Messerschmitt, hit from a distance of 800 yards. Jagdwaffe suffered one fighter combat casualty on that day. Fw. Anton Engels of 1./JG 77 was allegedly hit by A.A. fire and lost with his Bf 109F-4, W.Nr. 13386, Weiss 4 in the sea near Malta.

On 10 July, Beurling&#x27;s Malta tally rose to five in just four days, making him an ace. That day, it seems likely that he shot down the C.202 of &quot;Sergente Maggiore&quot; Francesco Visentini, from 378a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;.

On 12 July, Beurling, piloting a Spitfire and searching for Pilot Officer Berkeley-Hill, who was missing, spotted, at a lower altitude, &quot;Tenente Colonnello&quot; Aldo Quarantotti and &quot;Tenente&quot; Carlo Seganti flying Reggiane Re.2001s, who in turn were looking for Lieutenant Francesco Vichi, who had disappeared while a Spitfire was chasing him. Beurling, with Flying Officer Erik Hetherington, dived on the tail of the second of the two Reggianes and downed Seganti. Then Beurling attacked the other Reggiane. He closed up to and just when Quarantotti spotted him, Beurling delivered a short burst that decapitated the Italian commander. This aircraft also fell into the sea. Two days later it was the Reggianes who attacked him and badly shot up his Spitfire. Beurling&#x27;s aircraft was &quot;riddled by better than 20 bullets through the fuselage and wings&quot;. &quot;An explosive bullet nicked my right heel&quot;, he recalled.

On 22 July, Beurling lost his best friend in Malta, French-Canadian Pilot Jean Paradis. The following day, eight 249 Spitfires were scrambled. Beurling claimed to have badly damaged a bomber and, after a long dogfight with a Reggiane, to have &quot;blown his left wing off&quot;. The 151a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, in fact, lost &quot;Sergente Maggiore&quot; Bruno Di Pauli. The Macchi 202 pilot reported to have parachuted down after an AA shell had damaged his aircraft and realizing that he was followed by six Spitfires that, at the moment, had still not fired.
27 July was Beurling&#x27;s &quot;biggest day on Malta&quot;. That day, he shot down &quot;Sergente&quot; Faliero Gelli, and immediately afterwards, Captain Furio Niclot Doglio, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;″s best fighter ace, both flying Macchi MC. 202s. Doglio, who was diving to counter attack the head-on Spitfires of 126 Squadron and had misunderstood the warning waggling of wings of his wingman, &quot;Maresciallo&quot; Ennio Tarantola (who had seen the oncoming 249 Squadron fighters from left, high above), was Beurling&#x27;s 14th &quot;kill&quot;.

On the same day, Beurling also claimed two Bf 109s, one of which was piloted by the ace &quot;Leutnant&quot; Karl-Heinz Preu of JG 53 although other sources attribute this to flak. On 24 July 1942, Beurling was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal, the citation read:

On 30 July, he was commissioned as a pilot officer, and on 4 September won a bar to his DFM, largely for his exploits on 27 July. The citation read:

The enervation of daily combat combined with the effects of the poor rations and dysentery were telling. Beurling was bedridden for much of August and September, gaining only 1½ victories in August. On 8 August, while he was shooting at a Bf 109, he was jumped by two more. He hit one and it went straight into the sea: this was confirmed by his section leader. But his aircraft was then hit in the engine and he belly-landed in a stone-walled field. &quot;I climbed out&quot;, he recalled, &quot;unhurt except for a superficial cut in one arm.&quot; Beurling was shot down either by Herbert Rollwage or Siegfried Freytag and &quot;Fw&quot; Pohl of I./&quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 77 (JG 77—77th Fighter Wing), who all claimed a Spitfire shot down.

Beurling hitched back to Ta&#x27; Qali Field. On 25 September, he had another successful day, claiming to have downed three German fighters, but on this occasion his victories seem to be &quot;overclaimed&quot;. That day, flying with 11 other Spitfires, he met a dozen Bf 109s 30 miles northeast of Zonqor Point. He claimed to have &quot;disintegrated&quot; a first Bf 109, to have damaged a second and set a third on fire, that &quot;enveloped in flames, dived vertically striking the sea&quot;, the pilot bailing out. Two of these victims were two German fighters that came back to base, even if badly damaged and the third could be the one piloted by Kurt Gorbing, who made a forced-landing and died shortly afterwards.

On 10 October, Beurling was testing his newly serviced Spitfire when he was vectored to intercept two Bf 109s, flying line abreast at over Filfla. He reported to have hit &quot;the starboard fellow&quot; in the engine: &quot;He pancaked right smack down on his belly and flipped over onto his back.&quot; The second BF 109 tried to fly away but he hit the fuel tank: &quot;The ship blow up, complete with pilot.&quot; Those kills brought Beurling&#x27;s Malta tally to 21, plus another shared with two others. But there is no record of a Messerschmitt crashing on the island on 10 October 1942, nor any German losses. On the morning of 13 October, north of St Paul’s Bay, Beurling, attacked a formation of Junkers Ju 88s, escorted by 30 Bf 109s. He claimed to have at first hit a bomber, then an oncoming Bf 109 that burst into flames. Seconds later, he shot at a second Bf 109, without observing strikes, &quot;but pilot bailed out&quot;. On 16 October he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the citation read:


Beurling was a committed Christian and non-smoker. He dedicated himself totally to the art of aerial combat. Tending to be a loner on the ground and in the air, Beurling angered his commanders with his disdain for teamwork. His relentless concentration on aerial fighting led Beurling to develop a marked skill at deflection shooting and together with his situational awareness, he was soon recognised as a deadly fighter pilot. Like many successful Spitfire pilots, Beurling developed the habit of only engaging enemy aircraft at or less – a range at which many other pilots would be breaking away. Beurling owed his success to remarkably good eyesight and the ability to &quot;toss his Spitfire&quot; into violent combat manoeuvres. If jumped from behind, he would pull back on the stick of his Mk Vc Spitfire so hard that the aircraft would enter a violent stall, flick over and spin. This was a hard, sudden and very dangerous act for the enemy fighter on his tail to follow. Beurling would also ram both ailerons and rudder into a sudden and violent turn, causing his Spitfire to flip over and drop. This manoeuvre was notably difficulty and risky, although Beurling used it habitually.

Beurling was shot down four times over Malta. On 14 October 1942 (his last flight over Malta), Beurling scrambled with six other pilots from his squadron to intercept a raid of Ju 88s escorted by 60 Bf 109s, Macchi 202s and Reggiane 2001s just south of Zonqor Point. He strafed a bomber that he claimed to have shot down, but was, in turn, hit by return fire from the Ju 88: &quot;I picked up about 30 bullet holes.&quot; Then he claimed to have damaged a Messerschmitt and to have blown the left wing of another Bf 109 off at the root. Seconds later, another German fighter hit him from below. He was wounded in the heel, elbow and ribs, and his Spitfire was set on fire. He managed to bail out into the sea. During this action, no Messerschmitt was in fact destroyed. Only 2. &quot;Staffel&quot; (Black 1/7619) of I/JG53, flown by &quot;Obfw&quot; Josef Edere who was wounded, was damaged in the action, and Edere crash-landed at San Pietro, Sicily. Beurling was probably shot down by &quot;Obfw&quot; Riker of 4/JG53 or Ltn Karl von Lieres of 2/JG27 (who was credited with his 26th). Of the seven Ju 88s claimed to have been shot down by the RAF, only one did not return. After his rescue, Beurling was hospitalised.

Beurling was then sent back to Britain on 31 October 1942. On the way, the B-24 transport aircraft he was aboard crashed into the sea off Gibraltar. Beurling was one of only three survivors.

On 4 November he received the Distinguished Service Order, the citation read:

Over Malta, he had claimed over 27 kills, by far the highest total by an RAF pilot during the campaign.

===War bond drive===

After landing back in Britain, Beurling was then sent to Canada to join a Victory Loan Drive, selling war bonds, being the guest of honour at a parade in Verdun and meeting Prime Minister Mackenzie King. He was promoted to war substantive Flying Officer (on probation) on 30 January 1943. He did not enjoy the war bond campaign. Also, he often said things that embarrassed the RCAF, such as that he enjoyed killing people. The leg wound Beurling had received over Malta, combined with his poor general health, returned him to hospital for several weeks. He completed his promotional work in mid-1943 and also met his future wife, Diana Whittall in Vancouver.

====Instructor====
Returning to Britain, Beurling was posted as a gunnery instructor to 61 OTU. On 27 May 1943, he was posted to the Central Gunnery School at RAF Sutton Bridge. On 8 June, during a mock dogfight, Beurling was forced to bail out of Spitfire II P7913 when the engine caught fire after being accidentally hit. It is alleged that whilst stationed at RAF Sutton Bridge he actually flew under the Crosskeys Bridge that crosses the Nene, which still stands today having been built in 1897.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
On 1 September 1943, Beurling transferred to the RCAF, and was posted to an operational squadron, 403 (a return to his first squadron) at Kenley, flying the new Spitfire IX. Shooting down an Fw 190 of JG 2 in September, but unhappy with flying sweeps, Beurling requested command of a flight of North American P-51 Mustangs in order to carry out deep penetration, free-roaming raids into Germany. His request was turned down.

Disciplinary problems annoyed his commander, but Beurling was promoted to flight lieutenant. However, his stunting of a de Havilland Tiger Moth at zero feet over his airfield eventually led to his Wing Commander, Hugh Godefroy, threatening him with a court martial. Subsequently, Beurling was transferred to 126 Wing HQ and then to 412 Squadron.

At 412 Squadron, Beurling again came into conflict with his commander for stunting and his lack of teamwork, leading to his eventual grounding. He claimed his last kill on 30 December, shooting down and wounding Uzz. Heinz Wyrich of &quot;5 Staffel&quot;, JG 26 flying a Fw 190A-45 W.Nr. 1175, Weisse 16 2 km S. of Romaine, when the squadron was covering returning American bombers near Compiègne, France.

====Discharge====
Beurling returned to Canada in April 1944. He was given an honourable discharge in October and, despite an attempt to join the United States Army Air Forces, his wartime flying was over. He ended his career as a squadron leader with 31 and one shared official kills, nine claimed damaged, along with a DSO, DFC and a DFM and Bar.

==Death==
In 1948, Beurling was recruited to fly P-51 Mustangs for the Israeli Air Force. After a test flight, Beurling fatally crashed his Noorduyn Norseman transport aircraft while landing at Aeroporto dell&#x27;Urbe in Rome on 20 May 1948, just six days after the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Also killed was British volunteer Leonard Cohen, another Malta RAF pilot. 

It was his tenth crash. Suspicion at the time of the accident centred on possible sabotage, which was never proven. &quot;The initial report, while it identified the crew as Beurling and Cohen, acknowledged that the bodies were burned beyond recognition.&quot; Beurling&#x27;s widow, family and personal friends were not in attendance at the funeral in Rome. On a small brass plate over the lid of the coffin were the words &quot;Colonel Georgio Beurling&quot;.

Beurling&#x27;s coffin was kept for three months in a warehouse in the Verano Monumental Cemetery, as nobody had claimed the body. Then his widow, Diana Whittall Gardner, had him buried in the Cimitero Acattolico behind the Cestia Pyramid, between the graves of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats. In November 1950, two and half years after his death, Beurling&#x27;s casket arrived at Haifa Airport. His coffin, draped with the blue and white Israeli flag, was laid in a nearby air force base, where an honour guard of young airmen mounted a silent watch. During the long funeral in the streets of Haifa, Israeli Air Force aircraft paid homage to Beurling. At last, he was re-interred in the military cemetery at the foot of Mount Carmel. The grave is marked, as are the others in Israel Defense Forces cemeteries, with only name, serial number and rank: for Beurling that of &quot;segen&quot; (lieutenant).

==Legacy==
&quot;Malta Spitfire&quot;, an account of his time in Malta, co-written by Leslie Roberts and Beurling, was first published in 1943.

&quot;In Verdun the only reminder of the famous son is the boulevard which carries Beurling&#x27;s name.&quot; Beurling Academy, a high school in the Lester B. Pearson School Board in Verdun, is also named after him.

==Summary of victory claims==

Beurling was provisionally credited with 31 air victories destroyed (and one third shared destroyed), and 9 damaged.

<text>The Schlern (; ; ; 2,563 m) is a mountain of the Dolomites in South Tyrol, Italy. The peak at the north west end of the mountain (left, in the image at right) was first ascended in July 1880 by Johann Santner. It is named the Santner Spitze in his honour.

The Schlern dominates the villages of Seis am Schlern and Völs am Schlern, and the summit can be reached following the circular route marked with the number 1 from both villages.

At , there is the &quot;Schlernboden&quot; inn and on the summit plateau is the &quot;Schlernhaus&quot; inn , both open from 1 June to 15 October. The highest summit is the Petz with .

The Schlern is sung of in the &quot;Bozner Bergsteigerlied&quot; as one of South Tyrol&#x27;s landmarks. Its characteristic profile appears on the &quot;Der Schlern - Zeitschrift für Südtiroler Landeskunde&quot; (Magazine for South Tyrolean Regional Studies) and the logo pressed into Loacker&#x27;s wafer biscuits.

==Toponymy==
The etymology of the mount probably predates Germanic and even Roman times, from a common Old European root &quot;*sala&quot; (&quot;stream, ditch, canal, etc.&quot;, from the locale around it). The name was borrowed and Germanized over centuries (and to this day, a Bavarian dialect variant is written with the initial palatized &quot;Sch-&quot;, but the original &quot;S-&quot;). However, a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*skel&quot; (&quot;to cut&quot;, referring to the cliffside geology) has also been proposed.

<text>The Morning Star is a left-wing British daily newspaper with a focus on social, political and trade union issues. Originally founded in 1930 as the Daily Worker by the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), ownership was transferred from the CPGB to an independent readers&#x27; co-operative, the People&#x27;s Press Printing Society, in 1945 and later renamed the &quot;Morning Star&quot; in 1966. The paper describes its editorial stance as in line with &quot;Britain&#x27;s Road to Socialism&quot;, the programme of the Communist Party of Britain.

The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; initially opposed the Second World War and its London edition was banned in Britain between 1941 and 1942. After the Soviet Union joined the Allies, the paper enthusiastically backed the war effort. During the Cold War, the paper provided a platform for critics of the US and its allies. This included whistleblowers who provided evidence that the British military were allowing their forces to collect severed heads during the Malayan Emergency, and exposing the mass graves of civilians killed by the South Korean government.

The paper prints contributions by writers from a variety of left-wing political perspectives. Contributors include Jeremy Corbyn, Virginia Woolf, Angela Davis, Billy Strachan, Len Johnson, Wilfred Burchett, Claudia Jones, Jean Ross, and Harry Pollitt. Correspondent Alan Winnington had his British passport revoked in 1954 for his reporting on massacres in the Korean War, and favourable representation of North Korean prisoner-of-war camps. Some non-political topics covered by the paper have included arts reviews, sports, gardening, book reviews, and cooking.

== The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; (1930–1966)==

===Early years===

The &quot;Morning Star&quot; was founded in 1930 as the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, the paper representing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and was immediately preceded by and grew out of the &quot;Weekly Worker&quot; (10 Feb 1923 – 21 Jan 1927) and &quot;Workers Life&quot; (28 Jan 1927 – 20 Dec 1929) newspapers. The first edition was produced on 1 January 1930 from the offices of the newspaper in Tabernacle Street, London, after a meeting the day before by nine British communists, including Willie Gallacher, Kay Beauchamp, Tom Wintringham, Walter Holmes, and Robert Page Arnot. In the first few decades of its existence, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; contained cartoons for children. The &quot;Daily Worker&#x27;s&quot; first issue contained a children&#x27;s cartoon titled &quot;Micky Mongrel the Class Conscious Cur&quot;, drawn by artist Gladys Keable, which would become a staple of the early paper. The paper&#x27;s first editor was journalist William Rust, while the paper&#x27;s assistant editor and manager was Tom Wintringham, and was printed at Wintringham&#x27;s Unity Press. In January 1934, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; offices moved to Cayton Street, off City Road. The first eight-page &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was produced on 1 October 1935.

===Second World War===
On 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain spoke to the nation on the BBC, at which time he announced the formal declaration of war between Britain and Nazi Germany. &quot;Daily Worker&quot; editor J. R. Campbell, backed by his political ally, Party General Secretary Harry Pollitt, sought to portray the conflict against Hitler as a continuation of the anti-fascist fight. This contradicted the position of the Comintern in the aftermath of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (which became CPGB policy on 3 October) that the war was a struggle between rival imperialist powers, and Campbell was removed as editor as a result, being replaced by William Rust.

The paper accused the British government&#x27;s policies of being &quot;not to rescue Europe from fascism, but to impose British imperialist peace on Germany&quot; before attacking the Soviet Union. The newspaper responded to the assassination of Leon Trotsky by a Soviet agent with an article on 23 August 1940, entitled &quot;A Counter Revolutionary Gangster Passes&quot;, written by former editor Campbell.

The paper criticised Sir Walter Citrine after his meeting in Paris with French Labour Minister Charles Pomaret in December 1939. &quot;Time&quot; said of the events following the meeting, &quot;Minister Pomaret clamped down on French labour with a set of drastic wage-&amp;-hour decrees and Sir Walter Citrine agreed to a proposal by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon that pay rises in Britain be stopped&quot;. Citrine sued the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; for libel after it accused him and his associates of &quot;plotting with the French Citrines to bring millions of Anglo-French Trade Unionists behind the Anglo-French imperialist war machine&quot;; the publisher pleaded the British press equivalent of &quot;fair comment&quot;. Citrine alleged, in response to his lawyer&#x27;s questioning, that the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; received £2,000 per month from &quot;Moscow&quot;, and that Moscow directed the paper to print anti-war stories.

During this period, when the Soviet Union had a non-aggression pact with Germany, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; ceased to attack Nazi Germany. On 21 January 1941, publication of the newspaper was suppressed by the Home Secretary in the wartime coalition, Herbert Morrison (a Labour Party MP). It had repeatedly ignored a July 1940 warning that its pacifist line contravened Defence Regulation 2D, which made it an offence to &#x27;systematically to publish matter calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution of the war&#x27;. A Scottish edition of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was produced from its plant in Glasgow from 11 November 1940. On 16 April 1941, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; offices at Cayton Street were totally destroyed by fire during the Blitz. The paper moved temporarily in 1942 to the former Caledonian Press offices in Swinton Street (whence the old Communist Party &quot;Sunday Worker&quot;, edited by William Paul and Tom Wintringham, had been published from 15 March 1925 until 1929). New offices were acquired in 1945, at a former brush-makers&#x27; warehouse at 75 Farringdon Road, for the sum of £48,000.

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, the situation changed; British Communists became fervent supporters of the war. For the rest of the war, the paper was a strong supporter of the British war effort, and campaigned to organise a &quot;Second Front&quot; in Europe to assist the Soviet Union. The government&#x27;s ban on the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was lifted in September 1942, following a campaign supported by Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury, and Professor J. B. S. Haldane. A &quot;Lift the ban&quot; conference at Central Hall, Westminster on 21 March 1942 was attended by over 2,000 delegates. A key part of the campaign was to secure Labour Party support (Herbert Morrison was a fierce opponent of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;). On 26 May 1942, after a heated debate, the Labour Party carried a resolution declaring the government must lift the ban on the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.

The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; welcomed the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, editorialising &quot;The employment of the new weapon on a substantial scale should expedite the surrender of Japan&quot;. The paper also applauded the bombing of Nagasaki, and called for the use of additional atomic bombs against the Japanese.

The People&#x27;s Press Printing Society was formed just after the war in 1945. The society&#x27;s purpose was to raise money for the paper under a co-operative ownership model, and it quickly attracted support from the labour movement. By January 1946 it had 10,000 individual members, as well as organisational membership from 186 trade union bodies and 17 other co-operatives. One month later, in February 1946, a large rally was organised at the Royal Albert Hall, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; which was then owned by Keable Press Ltd on behalf of the Communist Party of Great Britain, was sold to the People&#x27;s Press Printing Society for a single shilling.

===Postwar===
The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; reached its peak circulation after the war, although precise circulation figures are disputed – from 100,000 to 122,000 to 140,000 and even 500,000.

The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; campaigns against the colour bar in Britain inspired British middleweight champion boxer Len Johnson to join the Communist Party of Great Britain, and write a boxing column for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.

The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was fully supportive of the show trials in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria in the late 1940s, as well as the split with Tito and Yugoslavia in 1948.

In 1950 &quot;Daily Worker&quot; foreign correspondent Alan Winnington published &quot;I Saw the Truth in Korea&quot;, which provided evidence of mass graves containing thousands of corpses belonging to civilians executed by South Korean government during the Korean War. The paper published alleged evidence of the America&#x27;s use of biological weapons during the Korean War. In response to Winnington&#x27;s Korea reporting, Clement Attlee&#x27;s cabinet discussed having Winnington executed by charging him with treason. However, it was instead decided to make him stateless by refusing to renew his passport. Phillip Knightley described Winnington as one of the most trustworthy voices of the war.

In April 1952, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; published photographs of a Royal Marine commando in the middle of a British military base posing with the severed human head believed to have belonged to a member of the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA). The article also included eyewitness testimonies from British personnel in Malaya alleging that it was common for British troops to behead people. An Admiralty spokesman accused the photographs of being forgeries and a &quot;communist trick&quot;, though Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton later confirmed to Parliament that the images were genuine. Lyttleton noted the decapitations were conducted by Iban headhunters by the British. The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; then published several more photographs of MNLA guerrillas decapitated by Ibans, including photographs of an Iban wearing a Royal Marine beret while preparing a scalp above a basket of human limbs.

In 1956, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; suppressed correspondent Peter Fryer&#x27;s reports from the Hungarian revolution, which were favourable to the uprising. The paper denounced the attempted revolution as a &quot;white terror&quot;, invoking the Horthy regime and earlier 1919–1921 period.

By the late 1950s the paper was down to just one sheet of four pages. The last edition of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was published on Saturday 23 April 1966. An editorial in that final issue declared:

In February every year between 1950 and 1954, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; held a rally at Harringay Arena in Harringay, north London, attended by about 10,000 people. Guests were entertained by tableaux set to music. Paul Robeson also sent recorded messages which were played during the rallies.

==&quot;Morning Star&quot; (1966–present)==

===History===
The first edition of the &quot;Morning Star&quot; appeared on Monday, 25 April 1966. South African exile Sarah Carneson worked for the newspaper in the late 1960s.

Until 1974, the paper was subsidised by the Soviet government with direct cash contributions, and from 1974 onwards was indirectly supported by daily bulk orders from Moscow. Its chief executive from 1975 was Mary Rosser.

By the late 1970s, the paper and the CPGB were beginning to come into conflict with one another, as the Eurocommunist trend in the CPGB grew, while the &quot;Morning Star&quot; at the time retained a pro-Soviet stance and opposed Eurocommunism. An editorial in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, however, reported in 1977 that the paper was giving coverage to dissidents in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in the Soviet bloc to the consternation of about a third of CPGB members who wanted a reversal to a strictly pro-Kremlin line. &quot;The &quot;Morning Star&quot; is open for genuine debate about the future of the Left&quot;, it asserted. A demonstration outside the East German embassy against the imprisonment of reformist Communist Rudolf Bahro was organised by the &quot;Morning Star&quot; that year. Also in 1977, editor Tony Chater persuaded the Labour government to begin running advertisements in the newspaper, previously absent because of a lack of audited circulation figures.

In December 1981, when the Polish Solidarity trade union movement was suppressed and martial law declared, the paper criticised the executive committee of the party for condemning the acts of the (then-Communist) Polish government. In 1982, the &quot;Morning Star&quot; attacked the attitudes of &quot;Marxism Today&quot;, the party&#x27;s monthly journal, which was controlled by the Eurocommunists.

The newspaper attracted some wider media attention in September 1981 when the BBC paid to place six advertisements for its Russian-language service in the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, which was one of the few English language newspapers that the USSR government allowed to be circulated in the country. Four of these advertisements were printed as agreed, but the last two of the six were not printed. A spokesman for the newspaper said that the advertising department had not properly consulted with other teams before making the agreement, and that the BBC&#x27;s broadcasts were part of Cold War propaganda. The paper supported the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) during the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985, but the party had become critical of NUM leader Arthur Scargill&#x27;s strategy towards the end of the strike.

Meanwhile, in March 1984, the CPGB Executive Committee (EC) issued a seven-page document which was heavily critical of editor Tony Chater, in particular because he had refused to print an article which commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the death of Lenin. The EC put forward candidates to challenge those loyal to Chater at the 1984 AGM of the PPPS and called for Chater&#x27;s replacement. He was expelled from the CPGB in January 1985, along with the assistant editor, David Whitfield, reportedly because the attempts to remove him as editor had failed. A statement by the party&#x27;s EC asserted that the paper was &quot;being systematically used to attack and undermine congress policy, support factional activities in the party, and help sectarian minority groupings in their opposition to the party majority&quot;. In June 1985, however, AGMs of the PPPS held in Glasgow, Manchester and London voted by about 60 to 40% for candidates backed by the management committee of the &quot;Morning Star&quot;.Chater remained editor of the paper until 1995 when he retired. Control of the newspaper passed from the Eurocommunist leadership of the CPGB to the newly established pro-Soviet Communist Party of Britain (CPB).

On the day before the Berlin Wall began to be demolished in 1989, under a headline reading &quot;GDR unveils reforms package&quot;, the newspaper commented that &quot;The German Democratic Republic is awakening&quot;, and quoting material supplied by East Germany&#x27;s ruling Socialist Unity Party: &quot;A revolutionary people&#x27;s movement has set in motion a process of serious upheaval ... The aim is dynamically to give socialism more democracy&quot;

Soviet bulk orders ended abruptly in 1989 (the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had still been buying 6,000 copies every day), and the termination of this order, with only a week&#x27;s notice, was the cause of &quot;huge financial disruption&quot;.

In the 1990s, the publication&#x27;s circulation fell to 7,000, following the end of the Soviet bulk sales. There were tensions between different CPB factions over control of the paper, and in particular over the successor of Tony Chater as editor. Chief Executive Mary Rosser favoured the news editor, Paul Corry (also her son-in-law); the staff and by the unions favoured Chater&#x27;s deputy, John Haylett, who was installed in February 1995. In 1998 many of its workers – then earning £10,500 a year and with no raise for 11 years – went on strike. These strikes were provoked by the sacking by Rosser of Haylett for &quot;gross misconduct&quot;. During the protest a breakaway from the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, the &quot;Workers&#x27; Morning Star&quot; was formed, and published by a small group of journalists who worked for the &quot;Morning Star&quot; at the same time. This paper was discontinued before the end of the decade. Haylett was eventually reinstated as editor and the protests stopped, as the circulation saw a moderate increase. &quot;Our political relationship is still with the Communist Party of Britain&quot;, he said in 2005, pointing out that only about 10% of readers were members of the party, &quot;but now we represent a broad movement&quot;.

Although the paper is normally published from Monday to Saturday, an issue of the &quot;Morning Star&quot; was published on 13 September 2015, its first ever Sunday edition, to cover the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party.

In December 2016, the newspaper was criticised by Labour MPs led by John Woodcock (&quot;one of the fiercest critics of British government inaction over aid to the region&quot;, according to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;) for its description of the imminent fall of Aleppo to Syrian government forces in a front-page headline as a &quot;liberation&quot;. Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop tweeted: &quot;Hard left joining with far right in welcoming dictators &quot;liberating&quot; Aleppo. Absolute disgrace&quot;. Other Labour MPs joining in the criticism were Stephen Doughty, Angela Smith, Ian Austin, Mike Gapes, Jess Phillips, Toby Perkins and Wes Streeting. Conservative MP George Osborne and &quot;Guardian&quot; writer Owen Jones also attacked the paper&#x27;s headline. However, the paper rejected the criticism, stating that &quot;from a purely technical point of view, when a sovereign government reclaims territory previously held by enemy forces, that&#x27;s called &quot;liberation&quot; whether we like the outcome or not&quot;. Stop the War Coalition convener Lindsey German, and political commentator Peter Oborne defended the &quot;Star&quot; reporting of the issue, and questioned the dominant media narrative, respectively. Jeremy Corbyn said he &quot;disagreed&quot; with the headline, emphasising that he always advocated a ceasefire and &quot;a political settlement in Syria&quot;. However, he refused to say he would never buy or read the paper again, saying; &quot;Listen, I buy lots of newspapers. I frequently disagree profoundly with headlines, even in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Mail&quot;, and so on. Does it mean I won&#x27;t buy them, or read them? Of course not.&quot;

During the late 2010s the &quot;Morning Star&quot; played a key role in helping historians uncover facts about pioneering black civil rights activist Billy Strachan.

In June 2022, the paper published a statement by the Communist Party of Britain on the &#x27;situation in Ukraine&#x27; that stated &quot;the war between Russia and Ukraine is part of a wider conflict between capitalist powers, between Russia on one side and Ukraine and the expansionist NATO powers on the other.&quot; It went on to call NATO &quot;an alliance of imperialist powers&quot;. It declared the Russian military actions unjustified and called for an immediate ceasefire, but opposed sanctions. 

===Editorial line and contents===
The newspaper describes itself as &quot;a reader-owned co-operative and unique as a lone socialist voice in a sea of corporate media&quot;. The paper attempts to speak to the working class a group its editor described in 2015 as around 80% to 90% of the British population who work for a wage rather than living off investments or assets. Successive annual general meetings of the People&#x27;s Press Printing Society have agreed that the policy of the paper is founded on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Road to Socialism&quot;, the programme of the Communist Party of Britain. A profile of the paper which was published in the centre-left &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine in 2015 commented on its contents that:

On international issues, the paper was historically sympathetic to the Soviet Union and its allies during the Cold War. Commentators have suggested that it maintains a fairly anti-Western worldview into the 21st century. Its attitude to the wider world has been criticised by others on the British left with Paul Anderson former editor of the democratic socialist &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine commenting that &quot;It runs articles extolling the virtues of single-party &#x27;socialist&#x27; states on a regular basis – North Korea, Cuba, China, Vietnam. Its default position on just about everything happening in the world is that anything any western power supports – but particularly the United States – must be opposed, which has led to it cheering on Putin, Hamas, Assad and a lot of other real nasties.&quot; The paper is sympathetic to Irish republicanism categorising reporting about Northern Ireland as foreign.

On its masthead, the paper states that it supports peace and socialism, and it is also Eurosceptic. The &quot;Morning Star&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot; were the only publications to campaign for an Exit vote in the 1975 referendum. Tony Benn (described as &quot;the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the &quot;Out&quot; campaign&quot;) campaigned alongside the paper. Over thirty years later the &quot;Morning Star&quot; supported the No2EU platform in the 2009 European Parliament election. The paper was also supportive of Britain&#x27;s vote in 2016 to leave the EU, saying that &quot;Anybody who supports the election of a Corbyn government with a mandate to end austerity, extend public ownership, redistribute wealth and restructure our economy in the interests of working people needs to explain how this agenda can be implemented in the framework of an EU that bans so much of it&quot; but criticised the referendum campaign as being headed by &quot;reactionary zealots&quot; such as Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.

The paper advocates a vote for the Labour Party in most seats, except for the handful in which the Communist Party of Britain has a candidate. During Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s term as Labour leader, the Communist Party of Britain did not stand any candidates against Labour in the 2017 or 2019 general elections, and the &quot;Morning Star&quot; became wholly pro-Labour in this period. The paper has also received contributions from representatives of the Green movement, religious organisations as well as Scottish and Welsh nationalists.

===Contributors and staff===

In the first years of the twenty-first century, the paper has carried contributions from Uri Avnery, John Pilger, Green activist Derek Wall, ex-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, Green MP Caroline Lucas, former MP George Galloway (Respect), the cartoonist Martin Rowson, and many trade union general secretaries. Features are contributed by writers from a range of socialist, social democratic, green and religious perspectives. Despite this, according to then editor John Haylett in 2005: &quot;things that happened in the Soviet Union 70 years ago are still being used as a stick to beat the &quot;Morning Star&quot;.&quot;

On 1 January 2009, Bill Benfield took over as editor of the &quot;Morning Star&quot;. John Haylett, who had been editor since 1995, took up the post of political editor. Benfield had previously been deputy editor and head of production, but experienced ill health.

In May 2012, Richard Bagley became editor of the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, having already worked at the paper in various positions since 2001. In July 2014, he stepped down as editor, with Ben Chacko becoming acting editor, a position in which Chacko was confirmed in May 2015. The newspaper &quot;is the most precious and only voice we have in the daily media&quot;, said (then backbencher Labour MP) Jeremy Corbyn at the time of Chacko&#x27;s formal appointment in May 2015. &quot;I look forward to working with Ben in promoting socialism and progress&quot;.

===Finances and circulation===

The &quot;Morning Star&quot; carries little commercial advertising, with low advertising rates, and the cover price does not pay for print and distribution. Consequently, the paper has always been dependent on donations from activists, readers, and trade unions. The paper relies on its &quot;Star Fund&quot; appeal (monthly target £18,000). In its past, the paper received a subsidy from the Soviet Union in the form of bulk orders. In 1981, its circulation was about 36,000, down from the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;″s post-war peak.

In March 2005, &quot;BBC News Magazine&quot; reported the &quot;Morning Star&quot;″s circulation as between 13,000 and 14,000, quoting Haylett&#x27;s comment &quot;perhaps only one in 10 of these readers would label themselves as Communists&quot;. The circulation was thought to be around 10,000 when Ben Chacko took over as editor in mid-2015.

The &quot;Morning Star&quot; has also taken a much higher profile at trade union gatherings and within the UK trade union movement, particularly with unions such as Unite, GMB, UCATT, FBU, Community, CWU, NUM, Durham Miners, Prison Officers and RMT. Since 2008, the &quot;Morning Star&quot; has hired exhibition space at the Trades Union Congress, with sponsored copies being handed out to delegates at the TUC, Labour Party Conference, at union conferences and high-profile events such as the Tolpuddle Martyrs&#x27; Festival and the Durham Miners Gala. The newspaper is also available at independent newsagents and shops such as RS McColl, in local supermarkets such as Budgens, at railway stations and on motorway service areas. In addition, it is stocked by the Co-op Food chain of stores.

During the early morning of 28 July 2008, the offices of the newspaper were damaged by fire, and the edition of 29 July took a reduced form. A similar incident occurred on 20 October 2014 when a fire broke out near the offices and a small number of staff had to relocate to the sports editor&#x27;s house in order to finish the paper.

On 1 June 2009, the &quot;Morning Star&quot; was re-launched. The re-launch included a 16-page edition during the week, and a 24-page weekend edition priced at £1.20 after a rise in its prices in September 2014. This rose to 1.50 in 2020 There is no Sunday edition of the newspaper. There was also an expanded use of colour pictures and graphics, plus a redesign and a modern layout of the pages. The &quot;Morning Star&quot; also redesigned its website. In addition, a number of new and experienced journalists were engaged and the positions of full-time Industrial Correspondent and Lobby Correspondent in the House of Commons were reintroduced.

In November 2011, the &quot;Morning Star&quot; launched an urgent appeal to raise £75,000 in order to address a number of funding issues which meant the paper might have gone under by the end of the year.

On Monday 18 June 2012, the &quot;Morning Star&quot; moved to printing at two Trinity Mirror print sites in Watford and Oldham, which improved distribution of the &quot;Morning Star&quot; to all parts of the country, particularly Scotland.

In November 2021, &quot;The Canary&quot; revealed that the UK Foreign Office had tried, unsuccessfully, to discover the source of the &quot;Morning Star&quot;″s funding during the 1970s. A report by the Information Research Department stated: &quot;While watertight evidence is no doubt lacking, it might be possible for a skilled propagandist to present a convincing case which the CPGB [Communist Party of Great Britain] would find extremely difficult to refute. The project would require some detailed research which IRD could no doubt undertake in conjunction with the Security Service&quot;. Commenting on these revelations, Ben Chacko, the editor of the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, told &quot;The Canary&quot;:

===Online version===
An online version of the paper was launched on 1 April 2004. Initially only some parts of the site were free, including a PDF of the paper&#x27;s front page, the editorial &quot;Star Comment&quot; and all the articles from the culture and sports pages, while features and the current affairs were subscription-only. On 1 January 2009 this policy was changed, and all content was made freely available online. In April 2012, the paper launched a daily e-edition of the full newspaper, which readers can subscribe to for a charge. As of 2020, the number of articles non-subscribers can read for free is limited.

<text>Reutlingen, nicknamed &quot;The Gate to the Swabian Alb&quot; (), is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
The former free imperial city (until 1802) reached the limit of 100,000 residents in 1989. It is the ninth-largest city in Baden-Württemberg. Reutlingen district&#x27;s neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Esslingen, Göppingen, Alb-Donau, Biberach, Sigmaringen, Zollernalbkreis, Tübingen and Böblingen.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Reutlingen&quot;, which was created in 1803 when the previously free imperial city Reutlingen became part of Württemberg. In 1934, it was converted into the district, in 1938 the district Urach was dissolved and split between the districts Reutlingen and Münsingen. In 1973 the district Münsingen was dissolved, and most part was merged into the district Reutlingen. A few municipalities from the districts Tübingen, Saulgau, Sigmaringen and Nürtingen were also added.

==Geography==
The district is largely located in the Swabian Alb (&quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot;).

==Economy and infrastructure==

=== Transport ===
The district has no national (A) motorway (German: &quot;Autobahn&quot;) but has large Federal/National roads (German: &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot;):
* B 27, Stuttgart - Tübingen
* B 28, Tübingen - Ulm
* B 312, starting at A 8 exit 53b (Plieningen), Stuttgart Airport - A 7 exit 127 (Berkheim), ending near Memmingen, part of the dismissed A 85
* B 313, Plochingen - Sigmaringen
* B 464, distributor road from Reutlingen to B 27, only driving direction Stuttgart in district
* B 465, starting at A 8 exit 57 (Kirchheim unter Teck) - ending at Leutkirch im Allgäu

==Partnerships==
The district had a friendship with the Czech district Chrudim. In 2002, the Czech districts were reformed and the region Pardubice became the successor of the district Chrudim.

The district also has a friendship with the Italian
Province of Parma, as well as the district Sächsische Schweiz (now part of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge) in Saxony.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is the coat of arms of the Counts of Achalm, who ruled the largest part of the district until the 11th century. Even though these counts never used arms by themselves, the Zwiefalten Abbey appointed them these arms.
