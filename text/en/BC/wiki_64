<text>Sandra Louise Birdsell, CM (née Bartlette) (born 22 April 1942) is a Canadian novelist and short story writer of Métis and Mennonite heritage from Morris, Manitoba.

==Life and career==
Born in Hamiota, Manitoba, Birdsell was the fifth of eleven children. She lived most of her early life in Morris, Manitoba, where the family moved after her father joined the army in 1943. Her father was a French-speaking Cree Métis born in Canada and her mother was a Low-German speaking Mennonite who was born in Russia. When Birdsell was six and a half, her sister died from leukemia, which left a four-year gap between her and her next older sister. Her loneliness led her to ponder by herself to the nearby parks and rivers allowing her imagination to go wild.

Her hometown of Morris experienced a major flood in 1950. Her first three stories in &quot;Night Travellers&quot; are based on that flood. Birdsell left home at the age of fifteen, where she studied at the University of Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba, where she studied under Robert Kroetsch. In 1996, she moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, and currently resides in Ottawa, Ontario.

At the age of thirty-five, she enrolled in Creative Writing at the University of Winnipeg. Five years later, Turnstone Press published her first book, &quot;Night Travellers&quot;.

In January 2007, Birdsell began a four-month term as the Carol Shields writer in residence at the University of Winnipeg. In 2010, Birdsell was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada and in 2012 she was invested with Saskatchewan Order of Merit (SOM).

She is a mother to three children and a grandmother to four children.

=== Short stories ===

==== &quot;Night Travellers&quot; ====
Birdsell&#x27;s first book, a collections of interconnected short stories, &quot;Night Travellers&quot;(1982), is set in the imaginary Manitoba town of Agassiz, and concerns the large Lafreniere family: the teenaged sisters Betty, Lureen and Truda, their Mennonite mother Mika and their Métis father Maurice and the girls’ maternal grandparents, Oma and Opa Thiessen. Agassiz is based on the flood-prone town of Morris, on the banks of the Red River. where Birdsell spent her childhood. The source for the name Agassiz is Lake Agassiz, an enormous glacial lake that around 13,000 years ago covered much of what are now Manitoba, northwestern Ontario, northern Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, and Saskatchewan. Lake Agassiz is a controlling metaphor for the stories ... representing memory and ancestry&quot;. While the devastating flood that happened in Morris in 1950 &quot;is a related image that reverberates throughout the text&quot;.

1984 &quot;Night Travellers&quot; received the Gerald Lampert Award from League of Canadian Poets. Usually this its awarded for a first book of poetry.

====&quot;Ladies of the House&quot;====
Birdsell&#x27;s second collection, from 1984, is a sequel collection to &quot;Night Travellers&quot; that the focuses on the Laftenierre family women from Agassiz and their women friends, though most of the stories ae set in Winnipeg. In 1987 it was republished with &quot;Night Travellers&quot;, in one volume called Agassiz Stories. An American edition, titled &quot;Agassiz: A Novel in Stories&quot;, appeared in 1991 (Minneapolis: Milkweed).

=== Children&#x27;s literature ===
&quot;The Town That Floated Away&quot; (1997) was influenced by Birdsell&#x27;s experience as a child of the 1950 flood in Morris, and narrates the adventures of young Virginia Potts after she is left behind when her town floats away. Birdsell also wrote &quot;A Prairie Boy’s Winter&quot;, a one act play for children, which was co-written and produced by Prairie Theatre Exchange, in 1986.

=== Novels ===

==== &quot;The Missing Child&quot; ====

Birdsell&#x27;s first novel, published in 1989, is &quot;an evocative magic realist portrait of the fictional town of Agassiz&quot;,
which won the W.H. Smith/Books in Canada First Novel Award.

==== Chrome Suite ====
Birdsell&#x27;s second novel was published in 1992, and covers four decades of script-writer Amy Barber&#x27;s life: from an extraordinarily hot summer in a small Manitoba town in 1950; &quot;to the 1960s and the 1970s, when Amy marries, goes to live in the city, and begins to have reason to fear for her young son&quot;; to the present, with Amy traveling from Toronto to Winnipeg with her young Polish, film-maker lover.

==== &quot;The Russländer&quot; ====
Published in 2001, this is Birdsell&#x27;s third novel, and it explores Birdsell&#x27;s own family history. The word &quot;Russländer&quot; means &quot;Russians&quot; in German and her mother and maternal grandparents were Mennonite emigrants from Russia. It was published as &quot;Katya&quot; in the US.

It is the story of Katherine (Katya) Vogt, and her Mennonite family&#x27;s life in Russia from the end of 1910, until she, her husband, two sisters, and grandparents emigrated to Canada in 1923. Katya was born in 1902.

The story begins with the family living on the prosperous Mennonite estate of Abram Suddermann in Ukraine, where Katya&#x27;s father is the overseer. They are under the protection of the Tsar whose wife is German. This is part of the Chortitza Colony, land granted to German-speaking Mennonites for colonization. Chortitza was founded in 1789 by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonite settlers from West Prussia, and consisted of many villages. It was the first of many Mennonite settlements in the Russian Empire.

Life then becomes much harder when World War I begins and there is suspicion as to the loyalty of the Mennonites because they speak German. Life then eases when where the area is occupied by Austrian and German soldiers. However, Russia falls into chaos when they leave in 1917, with the February and October Revolutions. The Russian workers on the estate take the bloody revenge on the Mennonites. Katya&#x27;s parents and her siblings, but for two sisters are brutally murdered. After years of poverty and near-starvation. Katya, her husband, sisters, and grandparents eventually emigrate to Canada in 1923, to settle in Manitoba: &quot;Between 1923 and 1930, nearly 25,000 Mennonites fled violence that erupted in the Soviet Union&quot;.

<doc id="249742" wikidata="Q357211" url="?curid=249742" title="Graham Nash">
<text>Graham William Nash (born 2 February 1942) is an English-American musician, singer and songwriter. He is known for his light tenor voice and for his contributions as a member of the Hollies and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.

Nash is a photography collector, a published photographer, and digital image printing pioneer. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash in 1997 and as a member of the Hollies in 2010. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours List for services to music and to charity.

Nash holds four honorary doctorates, including one from the New York Institute of Technology, one in music from the University of Salford in 2011 and one in fine arts from Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Early life ==
Graham William Nash was born on 2 February 1942 in Blackpool, Lancashire, to where his mother had been evacuated from her hometown of Salford when World War II began. The family returned to Salford, where Nash grew up. When Nash was 14, his father was sent to prison for a year for receiving a stolen camera; he had bought the camera as a present for Graham but had then refused to disclose to the police the name of the relative who had sold it to him.

==Music career==

===The Hollies===

In the early 1960s, Nash co-founded the Hollies, one of the UK&#x27;s most successful pop groups, with school friend Allan Clarke, and was credited as the group&#x27;s leader on their first album. He was featured vocally on &quot;Just One Look&quot; (1964) and sang his first lead vocal on the original Hollies song &quot;To You My Love&quot; on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;In The Hollies Style&quot; of the same year. He often sang featured bridge vocals on later Hollies recordings (&quot;So Lonely&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Wrong&quot;, &quot;Pay You Back With Interest&quot;) and provided lead vocals on several later singles, notably &quot;On a Carousel&quot; and &quot;Carrie Anne&quot; (both 1967).

Nash encouraged the Hollies to write their own songs, initially with Clarke, then with Clarke and guitarist Tony Hicks. From 1964 to mid-1966 they wrote under the alias L. Ransford. Their own names were credited on songs from &quot;Stop Stop Stop&quot; from October 1966 onward. In 1965, Nash, with Allan Clarke and guitarist Tony Hicks, formed Gralto Music Ltd, a publishing company which handled their own songs and later signed the young Reg Dwight (a.k.a. Elton John) who played piano and organ on Hollies 1969 and 1970 recordings.

Nash was pivotal in the forging of a sound and lyrics, often writing the verses on Clarke, Hicks &amp; Nash songs. However, Nash also composed songs by himself under the &#x27;team banner&#x27; (like Lennon &amp; McCartney), including &quot;Fifi the Flea&quot; (1966), &quot;Clown&quot; (1966), &quot;Stop Right There&quot;, and &quot;Everything Is Sunshine&quot; (1967). The &quot;Butterfly&quot; album included several of his songs that had less group participation and exhibited more of a singer-songwriter approach. He was disappointed when this new style did not register with their audience, especially &quot;King Midas in Reverse&quot; (Nash and producer Ron Richards clashed over this song because Richards believed it was &#x27;too complex&#x27; to work as a hit single).

=== Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young ===

Nash initially met both David Crosby and Stephen Stills in 1966 during a Hollies US tour. On a subsequent visit to the US in 1968, he was more formally introduced to Crosby by mutual friend Cass Elliott in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. Nash left the Hollies to form a new group with Crosby and Stills. A trio at first, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash later became a quartet in 1969 with Neil Young: Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY).

With both configurations, Nash went on to even greater worldwide success, penning many of CSN&#x27;s most-commercial hit singles such as &quot;Our House&quot; (about the house in Laurel Canyon shared with his then-lover Joni Mitchell); &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; and &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; (both of which had been rejected by the Hollies); &quot;Just a Song Before I Go&quot;; and &quot;Wasted on the Way&quot;. Nash, nicknamed &quot;Willy&quot; by his bandmates, has been described as the glue that keeps their often fragile alliances together.

Nash became politically active after moving to California, as reflected in his anti-Vietnam War songs &quot;Military Madness&quot; and &quot;Chicago / We Can Change the World&quot; (about the trial of the Chicago Eight).

=== Crosby &amp; Nash ===

In 1972, during CSNY&#x27;s first hiatus, Nash teamed with Crosby, forming a successful duo. They worked in this configuration on and off for many years, producing four studio albums and a few live and compilation albums. His song &quot;Immigration Man&quot;, Crosby &amp; Nash&#x27;s biggest hit as a duo, arose from a tiff he had with a US Customs official while trying to enter the country.

=== Solo career ===
In 1971, Nash released his first solo album &quot;Songs For Beginners&quot; on Atlantic Records. His second album &quot;Wild Tales&quot;, was released in 1974. Later, Nash would perform these two albums live on tour in 2019.

In 1979, Nash co-founded Musicians United for Safe Energy which is against the expansion of nuclear power. MUSE put on the educational fundraising No Nukes events. In 2007 the group recorded a music video of a new version of the Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;.

=== Hollies reunion ===
Nash briefly rejoined the Hollies in 1983 (to mark their 20th anniversary) to record two albums, &quot;What Goes Around...&quot; and &quot;Reunion&quot;. In 1993, Nash again reunited with the Hollies to record a new version of &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; that featured lead vocal by Buddy Holly (taken from an alternative version of the song given to Nash by Holly&#x27;s widow Maria Eleana Holly)—this Buddy Holly &amp; the Hollies recording opened the &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; tribute album to Holly by various artists.

=== Later years ===
In 2005, Nash collaborated with Norwegian musicians A-ha on the songs &quot;Over the Treetops&quot; (penned by Paul Waaktaar-Savoy) and &quot;Cosy Prisons&quot; (penned by Magne Furuholmen) for the &quot;Analogue&quot; recording. In 2006, Nash worked with David Gilmour and David Crosby on the title track of David Gilmour&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;On an Island&quot;. In March 2006, the album was released and quickly reached No. 1 on the UK charts. Nash and Crosby subsequently toured the UK with Gilmour, singing backup on &quot;On an Island&quot;, &quot;The Blue&quot;, &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, and &quot;Find the Cost of Freedom&quot;.
In addition to his political songs Nash has written many songs on other themes he cares about such as of nature and ecology—beginning with the Hollies&#x27; &quot;Signs That Will Never Change&quot; (first recorded by the Everly Brothers in 1966)—later CSNY&#x27;s &quot;Clear Blue Skies&quot;, plus anti-nuclear-waste-dumping (&quot;Barrel of Pain&quot;), anti-war (&quot;Soldiers of Peace&quot;) and social issues (&quot;Prison Song&quot;).

Nash appeared on the season 7 finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; singing &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; with Brooke White.

In 2010, Nash was inducted a second time to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, this time as a member of the Hollies. He was appointed OBE &quot;for services to music and charitable activities&quot;, becoming an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Diplomatic and Overseas Division of the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List on 12 June 2010. Nash received the title of George Eastman Honorary Scholar at the George Eastman House on 22 January 2011, in Rochester, New York.

Nash contributed a cover of &quot;Raining in My Heart&quot; to the 2011 tribute album &quot;Rave on Buddy Holly&quot;.

On 22 January 2016, Nash announced the forthcoming release on 15 April 2016 of his new studio album entitled &quot;This Path Tonight&quot; (his first collection of new songs in fourteen years) and shared the title track from it through &quot;MOJO&quot; magazine&#x27;s website. On 4 February 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine unveiled a new song from the new album, the reflective &quot;Encore,&quot; the tender tune that wraps up Nash&#x27;s new album. Upon the upcoming release of his new studio album in April 2016, Nash planned a solo tour from 25 March 2016 at the Byron Bay Bluesfest in Australia, continuing United States on 22 April 2016 at Saban Theatre, Beverly Hills, California, to visit Europe starting from the UK on 21 May 2016 at the Albert Hall, Manchester and ending 14 June 2016 at the Alte Oper Hall, Frankfurt, Germany.

He was still touring in the fall of 2017, performing in New Jersey and New York in September.

On 29 June 2018, Rhino Records released the two-disk box set &quot;Over The Years&quot;, a 30-track collection of Nash&#x27;s demos made from 1968 to 1980, featuring highlights from the CSN debut album &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&quot; (&quot;Marrakesh Express&quot;), CSNY follow-up &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (&quot;Our House&quot;, &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;), song selections from subsequent CSN albums, four tracks from Nash&#x27;s 1971 solo album &quot;Songs For Beginners&quot;, with &quot;Better Days&quot; and &quot;I Used To Be King&quot; presented as unreleased mixes. The most recent recording on the compilation is &quot;Myself at Last&quot; from Nash&#x27;s 2016 solo album &quot;This Path Tonight&quot;. The second disc in this set features 15 demo recordings, 12 of which have never been released.

Nash and Stephen Stills, backed by Dawes, reunited for a performance of &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; at the January 30, 2025 Fire Aid benefit concert in Los Angeles. It marked the first time since 2016 that Nash and Stills have performed together.

== Photography career ==
Interested in photography as a child, Nash began to collect photographs in the early 1970s. Having acquired more than a thousand prints by 1976, Nash hired Graham Howe as his photography curator. In 1978 through 1984 a touring exhibition of selections from the Graham Nash Collection toured to more than a dozen museums worldwide. Nash decided to sell his 2,000 print collection through Sotheby&#x27;s auction house in 1990 where it set an auction record for the highest grossing sale of a single private collection of photography. Nash said that some of the auction profit would be given to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the acquisition of contemporary photographs.

In 2010 21st Editions published a monograph titled &quot;Love, Graham Nash&quot; which includes facsimiles of his lyrics paired with signed photographs by Graham Nash and printed by Nash Editions.

===Early digital fine art printing===
==== Experimenting ====
In the late 1980s Nash began to experiment with digital images of his photography on Macintosh computers with the assistance of R. Mac Holbert who at that time was the tour manager for Crosby, Stills and Nash as well as handling computer/technical matters for the band. Nash ran into the problem common with all personal computers running graphics software during that period: he could create very sophisticated detailed images on the computer, but there was no output device (computer printer) capable of reproducing what he saw on the computer screen. Nash and Holbert initially experimented with early commercial printers that were then becoming available and printed many images on the large format Fujix inkjet printers at UCLA&#x27;s JetGraphix digital output centre. When Fuji decided to stop supporting the printers, John Bilotta, who was running JetGraphix, recommended that Nash and Holbert look into the Iris printer, a new large format continuous-tone inkjet printer built for prepress proofing by IRIS Graphics, Inc. Through IRIS Graphics national sales rep Steve Boulter, Nash also met programmer David Coons, a colour engineer for Disney, who was already using the IRIS printer there to print images from Disney&#x27;s new digital animation system.

Coons worked off hours at Disney to produce large images of 16 of Nash&#x27;s photographic portraits on arches watercolour paper using Disney&#x27;s in-house model 3024 IRIS printer for a 24 April 1990 show at Simon Lowinsky gallery. Since most of the original negatives and prints had been lost in shipment to a book publisher, Coons had to scan contact sheets and enhance the images so they could be printed in large format. He used software he had written to output the photographic images to the IRIS printer, a machine designed to work with proprietary prepress computer systems.

In July 1990, Nash purchased an IRIS Graphics 3047 inkjet printer for $126,000 and set it up in a small carriage house in Manhattan Beach, California near Los Angeles. David Coons and Steve Boulter used it to print an even larger November 1990 show of Nash&#x27;s work for Parco Stores in Tokyo. The show entitled &quot;Sunlight on Silver&quot; was a series of 35 celebrity portraits by Nash which were 3 feet by 4 feet in an edition of 50 prints per image, a total of 1,750 images. Subsequently, Nash exhibited his photographs at the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego and elsewhere.

====Nash Editions====
In 1991, Nash agreed to fund Mac Holbert to start a fine art digital-based printing company using the IRIS Graphics 3047 printer sitting in Nash&#x27;s Manhattan Beach, California carriage house. Holbert retired as road manager for Crosby, Stills and Nash so that he could run the company. It opened its doors on 1 July 1991 with the name of Nash Editions Ltd. Early employees included David Coons, John Bilotta and a serigraphic print maker named Jack Duganne. They worked to further adapt the IRIS printer to fine art printing, experimenting with ink sets to try to overcome the fast-fading nature of IRIS prints, and even going as far as sawing off part of the print heads so they could be moved back to clear thicker printing paper stocks (voiding the $126,000 machine&#x27;s warranty). Nash and Holbert decided to call their fine art prints &quot;&quot;digigraphs&quot; although Jack Duganne coined the name &quot;Giclée&quot;&quot; for these type of prints. The company is still in operation and currently uses Epson-based large format printers.

In 2005, Nash donated the original IRIS Graphics 3047 printer and Nash Editions ephemera to the National Museum of American History, a Smithsonian Institution.

==Personal life==
Nash was married to his first wife, Rose Eccles, from 1964 until 1966. As part of an inside joke, her surname inspired the 1968 song &quot;Jennifer Eccles&quot;, and a jocular verse about Jennifer Eccles was also included in the 1968 song &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;. Nash was married to his second wife, actress Susan Sennett,&lt;ref name=&quot;tcmdb/174184&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; from 1978 until he left her for artist Amy Grantham in 2016. Sennett, the mother of his three now-adult children, divorced Nash in 2016 and died of cancer in September 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowdecatur/nash-estranged&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/2022/05/03/nash-families&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;observer/2016/boomer-badly&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to New York City, Nash married Grantham in April 2019.

Nash released an autobiography in September 2013 called &quot;Wild Tales: A Rock &amp; Roll Life&quot;, published by Crown Publishing. Photographs that he took during his career are on display as an art collection at the San Francisco Art Exchange. In interviews pertaining to both the memoir and art exhibit, he mentioned the impact of Canadian-American musician Joni Mitchell, with whom he had a relationship between 1968 and 1970 in California. He also had a brief relationship with American musician Rita Coolidge, as had his bandmate Stephen Stills.

Nash became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1978. He endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. In October 2020, he revealed that he had recently started practising Transcendental Meditation after American filmmaker David Lynch paid for him and his wife to study it as a gift. He said of the practice, &quot;Quite frankly, I&#x27;m 78 years old and I wish I&#x27;d been doing it for 50 years.&quot;

On 7 January 2024 Nash was the guest for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His choices included &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; by Gene Vincent, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; by Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush, and &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; by Samuel Barber. His favourite disc was &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by the Beatles, which he described as &quot;the greatest song that was ever written, I think.&quot;

He used to have a home in San Francisco.

<text>Blackbushe Airport is an operational general aviation airport in the civil parish of Yateley in the north-east corner of the English county of Hampshire. Built during the Second World War, Blackbushe is north of the A30 road between Camberley and Hook. For a time, it straddled this road, with traffic being stopped whilst airliners were towed across. The south side was used for aircraft maintenance, using wartime-built hangars. Today, only the part of the airfield that lay north of the A30 remains in active use. The historical name for the flat piece of land on which it is sited is Hartford Bridge Flats. The nearest towns are Yateley and Fleet.

Blackbushe Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P693) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Blackbushe Airport Limited). The aerodrome is licensed for night use.

One of several airfields eclipsed since 1958 by the growth of Heathrow and Gatwick airports, Blackbushe was once a significant airport for passenger and cargo charter flights for the London area.

Currently based aircraft include several corporate jets, two flying schools, a helicopter training facility, as well as Aerobility, a flying charity. The airport is open to the general public and is also popular for walks around its perimeter and to see the wildlife in Yateley Common and Castle Bottom National Nature reserve.

==Royal Air Force==

The airport started life in 1942 as RAF Hartford Bridge, and it was used by RAF squadrons throughout the remainder of Second World War for reconnaissance, defence and strike operations using Spitfires and Mosquitoes. It was also the home of the Free French Squadron (Lorraine).

A number of important people landed at the airport including King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Field Marshal Montgomery.

RAF Hartfordbridge was also the home of a new system known as &quot;FIDO&quot; (Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation) built by the Airforce Construction Unit. Pipes were laid down both sides on Runway 26, and fed with fuel. The pipes had small holes, and if the airfield was shrouded in fog, the fuel was ignited. The heat created would cause the fog to disperse.

On 18 November 1944, the airfield was renamed to RAF Blackbushe, because of confusion over a similar area in Norfolk. On 15 November 1946, the RAF had moved out, and the airport was handed over to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, becoming Blackbushe Airport. The A30 was fully reopened to traffic.

==Ministry of Civil Aviation==

In February 1947, the airfield was opened as Blackbushe Airport under the control of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Full customs facilities were provided for both air transport operators and the private owners of light and executive aircraft.

Over the next few years, airlines such as Britavia, Westminster Airways, Airwork, and Silver City all moved in operating Lancastrians (passenger aircraft derived from Lancaster bombers), DC-3s, and Bristol Freighters. Movements by 1950 had risen to 11,000 per year, with 16,000 passengers.

The 1950s saw further expansion, Air Contractors started a scheduled service to the Channel Islands, and Eagle Aviation launched several routes to Europe on DC-3s and Viking airliners. Britavia and Airwork also brought in the Hermes airliner, flying charters to Africa and Australia. Blackbushe became a robust diversion airport for London Heathrow, and as a home for aircraft visiting the Farnborough Airshow. The facilities were constantly being upgraded with new buildings, runway extensions, and new navigational aids and lighting.

Overseas-based charter airlines often used Blackbushe for their flight to the UK, normally finding that the airfield was open for operations, even when other airports in the London area were closed by fog. The airfield&#x27;s hilltop position helped in this respect. The Avro Yorks of Tropic Airways of Johannesburg visited for several years.

Blackbushe was used as a major location for the 1956 film &quot;The Crooked Sky&quot; in which the former RAF station buildings and then current commercial aircraft are seen.

The airport was also used as a filming location in the making of the 1951 film &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; directed by Henry Koster, starring James Stewart, Marlene Dietrich and Jack Hawkins.

==United States Navy operations==
From the early 1950s, the United States Navy (USN) had a facility on the north-east edge of the airport which frequently handled visiting naval aircraft. These included patrol types such as the Lockheed P2V Neptune and the Martin P4M Mercator. Large USN transports that used the airport regularly were the Douglas R5D Skymaster and Douglas R6D Liftmaster. In 1955, USN UK-based communications and liaison aircraft of FASRON 200, previously attached to RAF Hendon, in north London, were switched to Blackbushe.

By 1955, the airport was handling 36,000 movements per year. The US Navy also set up a base as a communications headquarters. This brought new aircraft such as Beech Expediters, Dakotas, DC-7s and Super Constellations. In the late 1950s, BOAC launched operations of the Comet airliners. Other operators such as Pan-Am, SAS, and BEA were using Blackbushe regularly as a diversion from Heathrow. However, with the newly built Gatwick airport, the lease on Blackbushe was not granted, and these operators started using Gatwick.

On 31 May 1960, the airport was closed. All of the infrastructure, fixtures, and fittings were auctioned off. Parts of the runways were dug up. The airport remained closed until 6 October 1962, when it was formally reopened as a general aviation field. During the closure, many light aircraft continued to use the airfield.

==Private ownership==

The airport passed into private ownership and was formally reopened as a general aviation field on 6 October 1962. There had been a fight to reopen the airport, as there were many objections; however, the reopening was mainly due to one man and his resolve, Air Vice Marshal Don Bennett, CB, CBE, DSO. Born in Toowoomba, Australia and best known for his RAF Pathfinder exploits in the Second World War and his escape after being shot down during the raid on the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, when he evaded capture and escaped to Sweden, from where he was able to return to Britain.

The Hampshire County Council Planning Committee rejected an application on 25 August 1961, one of two applications for the development of a private aerodrome on the site of Blackbushe Airport. The applications, made by AVM Bennett, were for the use of an area of 325 acres as a private aerodrome, and for the erection of aircraft hangars. The vice-chairman of the committee, Lord Porchester, said that the Ministry of Aviation was not supporting AVM Bennett in his attempt to re-open Blackbushe for private flying. The reported reasons for the committee&#x27;s decision were that most of the land was to be an open space, so that the proposal would be detrimental to the amenities of Yateley village, and it would interfere with safety and traffic flow on the Basingstoke - London A30 trunk road. Despite many objections, AVM Bennett battled the red tape and finally owned and opened the aerodrome in 1962.

The airport became a base for a large collection of historic World War II aircraft, including four Junkers Ju 52s, six Douglas DC-3s and a number of smaller planes, such as Spitfires, which were rarely seen on the tarmac. The finest was, perhaps, a Heinkel bomber, but this was sold in order to purchase a replacement which then crashed soon afterwards.

On 15 July 1978, the airfield hosted an all-day open-air concert, the Picnic at Blackbushe Aerodrome, which was attended by some 200,000 people. Bob Dylan headlined, with Eric Clapton, Joan Armatrading, Graham Parker and the Rumour, Lake, and Merger also appearing.

From 1985 to 2015, the airport was owned by British Car Auctions (BCA), which refurbished the terminal building, and replaced the tower in 1992.

From 1998 to 2009, The Queen&#x27;s helicopter was based there..

In 2008, the newly formed Blink launched their European air-taxi service from Blackbushe to over 600 destinations using a fleet of Cessna Citation Mustang aircraft. These were a regular sight at Blackbushe until Blink was closed by its new French owners in 2018.

In 2014, PremiAir, who had been based at Blackbushe since the early 2000s, and who operated light jets and executive helicopters from Blackbushe, went into administration. They were evicted from the 40,000 sq ft of hangars on the north side, and BCA repurposed them as part of their auction facilities.

==Present day==
In 2015, the airport was sold to Sir Peter Ogden, who had previously founded Blink in 2008. The north side hangars were not included in the sale, so Blackbushe currently has no hangar facilities.

The new owners plan to invest in the refurbishments of the airport and bring the facilities up to 21st century standards, including building new hangars to replace the space lost on the north side.

Investment has been made in repairs to the taxiways and parking areas, as well as repainting all of the airside markings.

In late 2017, a new airport management team was put in place. They have set about supporting the general aviation activities at the airport.

==De-registration of common land and future development==
Blackbushe Airport sits on part of Yateley Common. Despite access to the active airfield site being restricted since the 1940s, and provisions of the Aviation Security Act 2018 prohibiting trespass on an aerodrome, development of new facilities is restricted by this common land status. In November 2016, an application was submitted by Blackbushe Airport to Hampshire County Council to deregister the active aerodrome.

Blackbushe Airport have published its vision for the airport&#x27;s future, which includes a new terminal building, a new café, hangars for maintenance and aircraft parking, and a flying school hub.

A public inquiry was held at the Elvetham Hotel on 2–5 April 2019. On 12 June 2019, the Planning Inspectorate issued a decision granting the application to deregister the airport from Yateley Common.

Hampshire County Council subsequently sought a Judicial Review of the Inspector&#x27;s decision which was held at the Royal Courts of Justice on 11–12 February 2020. On 23 April 2020, the High Court ruled in favour of Hampshire County Council. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision, and the Supreme court declined to hear the case, referring the matter back to the Planning Inspector for redetermination. In November 2023, a Planning Inspector issued a decision confirming the footprint of the Terminal Building and part of the airport cafe to be removed from the register of common land, but no curtilage.

In January 2024, Blackbushe Airport submitted a new application to the Planning Inspectorate for de-registration and exchange of 35.3 acres of the airport for an equally sized area at Cottage Farm, some 2 miles to the east of the airport.

<doc id="249745" wikidata="Q16849887" url="?curid=249745" title="The Jealous God">
<text>The Jealous God is a 1964 novel by John Braine. The story, set in an Irish Catholic community of Yorkshire circa in the 1960s, follows a 30-year-old man and his attempts at liberating himself from his domineering mother. The title refers to his mother&#x27;s wish that her &quot;favorite&quot; son, despite being in his thirties already, pursue the career path of a clergyman. The book was adapted into a film in 2005.

==Summary==
Vincent Dungarvan is a history teacher at a Catholic school for boys. While his two brothers Matthew and Paul have been married with children for many years, Vincent is still single and living at home with his widowed mother, who is also a teacher. At 30, he is still a virgin. He has gone out with one or two Catholic girls but rejected them when he found them too superficial and boring.

One day, in the local library, he encounters Laura, a new librarian. Fascinated by her good looks and driven by (as he sees it) sinful desire, he is for once able to overcome his shyness and asks her out. Laura accepts, and they immediately fall in love with each other and start dating on a regular basis. However, he prefers not to tell his possessive mother about her, let alone invite her home.

In the course of the following weeks, Vincent&#x27;s life is shattered by a number of revelations concerning Laura. He is disappointed when she tells him that she is a Protestant and that she has stopped going to church altogether. Furthermore, through a deliberate indiscretion by Laura&#x27;s flatmate Ruth, he learns that Laura is divorced. For him as a Catholic, this means that he is seeing a married woman, which significantly increases his guilt and helplessness about the situation. Accordingly, they break up.

Soon afterwards, Vincent loses his virginity to Maureen, his sister-in-law, while his brother Matthew has gone out and the children are asleep. On the following morning, back at his mother&#x27;s, he recollects what happened the previous evening:

That very day, Vincent has an appointment with a senior clergyman about his vocation and once and for all makes up his mind not to become a priest. He also decides to see Laura again. In the meantime she has settled down in a flat of her own, and this is where they have sex for the first time, without Vincent confessing to Laura that he has recently made love to his own sister-in-law. When, some weeks later, Maureen announces that she is pregnant again, he is afraid that he might be the father of her baby. Out of jealousy, Maureen writes Laura&#x27;s ex-husband Robert an anonymous letter, urging him to make up with his wife again. Vincent and Laura split up again as Laura is not certain about her husband&#x27;s intentions.

In the end two instances of &quot;deus ex machina&quot; resolve the complicated situation. First, Maureen has a miscarriage, freeing Vincent.

<text>The Battle of York was a War of 1812 battle fought in York, Upper Canada (today&#x27;s Toronto, Ontario, Canada) on April 27, 1813. An American force, supported by a naval flotilla, landed on the western lakeshore and captured the provincial capital after defeating an outnumbered force of regulars, militia and Ojibwe natives under the command of Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada.

After Sheaffe&#x27;s forces were defeated, he ordered his surviving regulars to withdraw to Kingston, abandoning the militia and civilians. The Americans captured the fort, town, and dockyard. They themselves suffered casualties, including force leader Brigadier General Zebulon Pike and others killed when the retreating British blew up the fort&#x27;s magazine. After the Americans carried out several acts of arson and looting, they seized ordnance and supplies from the settlement and subsequently withdrew from the town weeks later.

Although the Americans won a clear victory, the battle did not have decisive strategic results as York was a less important objective in military terms than Kingston, where the British armed vessels on Lake Ontario were based.

==Background==
York, the capital of Upper Canada, stood on the north shore of Lake Ontario. During the War of 1812, the lake was both the front line between Upper Canada and the United States, and also served as the principal British supply line from Quebec to the various forces and outposts to the west. At the start of the war, the British had a small naval force, the Provincial Marine, with which they seized control of Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie. This made it possible for Major General Isaac Brock, who led British forces in Upper Canada, to gain several important victories in 1812 by shifting his small force rapidly between threatened points to defeat disjointed American attacks individually.

The United States Navy appointed Commodore Isaac Chauncey to regain control of the lakes. He created a squadron of fighting ships at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York by purchasing and arming several lake schooners and laying down purpose-built fighting vessels. However, no decisive action was possible before the onset of winter, during which the ships of both sides were confined to their harbours by ice. To match Chauncey&#x27;s shipbuilding efforts, the British laid down the Sloops-of-war at Kingston and , at York Naval Shipyards.

==Prelude==
===American planning===
On January 13, 1813, John Armstrong Jr. was appointed United States Secretary of War. He quickly assessed the situation on Lake Ontario and devised a plan by which a force of 7,000 regular soldiers would be concentrated at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on April 1. Working together with Chauncey&#x27;s squadron, this force would capture Kingston before the Saint Lawrence River thawed and substantial British reinforcements could arrive in Upper Canada. The capture of Kingston and the destruction of the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard together with most of the vessels of the Provincial Marine, would make almost every British post west of Kingston vulnerable if not untenable. After Kingston was captured, the Americans would then capture the British positions at York and Fort George, at the mouth of the Niagara River.

Armstrong conferred with Major General Henry Dearborn, commander of the American &quot;Army of the North&quot;, at Albany, New York during February. Both Dearborn and Chauncey agreed with Armstrong&#x27;s plan at this point, but they subsequently had second thoughts. That month, Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost, the British Governor General of Canada, travelled up the frozen Saint Lawrence to visit Upper Canada. This visit was made necessary because Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, who had succeeded Brock as Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, was ill and unable to perform his various duties. Prévost was accompanied only by a few small detachments of reinforcements, which participated in the Battle of Ogdensburg en route. Nevertheless, both Chauncey and Dearborn believed that Prévost&#x27;s arrival indicated an imminent attack on Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, and reported that Kingston now had a garrison of 6,000 or more British regulars.

Even though Prévost soon returned to Lower Canada, and deserters and pro-American Canadian civilians reported that the true size of Kingston&#x27;s garrison was 600 regulars and 1,400 militia, Chauncey and Dearborn chose to accept the earlier inflated figure. Furthermore, even after two brigades of troops under Brigadier General Zebulon Pike reinforced the troops at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor after a gruelling winter march from Plattsburgh, the number of effective troops available to Dearborn fell far short of the 7,000 planned, mainly as a result of sickness and exposure. During March, Chauncey and Dearborn recommended to Armstrong that when the ice on the lake thawed, they should attack the less well-defended town of York instead of Kingston. Although York was the provincial capital of Upper Canada, it was far less important than Kingston as a military objective. Historians such as John R. Elting have pointed out that this change of plan effectively reversed Armstrong&#x27;s original strategy, and by committing the bulk of the American forces at the western end of Lake Ontario, it left Sackett&#x27;s Harbor vulnerable to an attack by British reinforcements arriving from Lower Canada.

Armstrong, by now back in Washington, nevertheless acquiesced in this change of plan as Dearborn might well have better local information. Armstrong also believed that an easy victory at York would provide the government with a significant propaganda coup, as well as bolster support for the Democratic-Republican Party for the gubernatorial election in New York.

The attack was originally planned to commence in early April, although a long winter delayed the attack on York by several weeks, threatening the political value of such an attack. In an attempt to overcome these delays, Democratic-Republicans supporters circulated proclamations of victory prior to the battle to the New York electorate. The American naval squadron first attempted to depart from Sackets Harbor on April 23, 1813, although an incoming storm forced the squadron back to harbour, in order to wait out the storm. The squadron finally departed on the next day.

===British preparations===

The town of York was not heavily fortified, with insufficient resources preventing the construction of necessary works needed to adequately defend it. As a result, Sheaffe had instructed government officials in early April 1813 to hide legislative papers in the forest and fields behind York, to ensure they would not be seized in the event of an attack.

York&#x27;s defences included the town&#x27;s blockhouse situated near the Don River east of the town, the blockhouses at Fort York to the west, and another blockhouse at Gibraltar Point. The settlement was also defended by three batteries at the fort and the nearby &quot;Government House Battery&quot; which mounted two 12-pounder guns. Another crude battery, known as the Western Battery, was located west of the fort, in present-day Exhibition Place. It contained two obsolete 18-pounder guns, which originated from earlier conflicts and had been disabled by having their trunnions removed, but they were fixed to crude log carriages and could still be fired.

Fort York was also defended by a western wall and a small unarmed earthwork between the fort and the Western Battery. About a dozen cannons, including older condemned models, were mounted in these positions, in addition to two 6-pounders on field carriages. Further west were the ruins of Fort Rouillé, and the Half Moon Battery, neither of which was in use.

 Sheaffe was at York to conduct public business. He was originally scheduled to leave the settlement for Fort George but had postponed his departure due to suspicions of an American assault on York. His regulars, most of whom were also passing through York en route to other posts, consisted of two companies (including the grenadier company) of the 1st battalion 8th Regiment of Foot, a company of the Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles, a company-sized detachment of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, a small squad from the 49th Regiment of Foot, and thirteen soldiers from the Royal Artillery. There were also 40 or 50 Mississaugas and Ojibwe warriors, and the Canadian militia.

The American naval squadron was spotted by British sentries posted at the Scarborough Bluffs on April 26, who alerted the town and its defenders using flag signals and signal guns. The Militia was ordered to assemble, but only 300 of the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the York Militia, and a company of the Incorporated Militia, could be mustered at short notice. Sheaffe expected the Americans to launch a two-pronged attack, with the main American landing to the west of Fort York, and another landing in Scarborough to cut off a potential retreat to Kingston. To counteract this, Sheaffe concentrated most of his regulars, the Native warriors and a small number of militiamen at Fort York, while most of the militia and the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot positioned themselves at the town&#x27;s blockhouse.

===Order of Battle===
==Battle==
The Americans fleet appeared off of York late on April 26. Chauncey&#x27;s squadron consisted of a ship-rigged corvette, a brig and twelve schooners. The embarked force commanded by Brigadier General Zebulon Pike numbered between 1,600 and 1,800, mainly from the 6th, 15th, 16th and 21st U.S. Infantry, and the 3rd U.S. Artillery fighting as infantry. Dearborn, the overall army commander, remained aboard the corvette &quot;Madison&quot; during the action.

Early on April 27, the first American wave of boats, carrying 300 soldiers of Major Benjamin Forsyth&#x27;s company of the U.S. 1st Rifle Regiment, landed about west of the town, supported by some of Chauncey&#x27;s schooners firing grapeshot. The American force intended to land at a clear field, west of Fort York, but strong winds pushed their landing craft west of their desired landing site, towards a wooded coastline in today&#x27;s Humber Bay. Forsyth&#x27;s riflemen were opposed only by Native warriors, led by James Givins of the British Indian Department, and the grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot, who were dispatched to the area by Sheaffe. Only the Natives initially engaged the American landing. With American cannon fire threatening the roads on the waterfront, the British units dispatched from Fort York had to traverse through the forest behind the waterfront; and were unable to reach the landing site before the Americans started their landings.

Sheaffe had also ordered a company of the Glengarry Light Infantry to support the Natives at the landing, but they became lost in the outskirts of the town, having been misdirected by Major-General Aeneas Shaw, the Adjutant General of the Canadian Militia, who took some of the militia north onto Dundas Street to prevent any wide American flanking maneuver. After it became apparent that no landing would occur east of the settlement, Sheaffe recalled the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot from the town&#x27;s blockhouse.

As the landings progressed, the British and Native force was outflanked and began to fall back into the woods. The U.S. 15th Infantry Regiment was the second American unit to land, with bayonets fixed, under a hail of fire, shortly followed by Pike, who assumed personal command of the landing. Sheaffe arrived with the rest of the 8th Regiment of Foot, the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, and a few dozen militiamen after the U.S. 15th Infantry Regiment had landed. The grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot charged them with the bayonet. The grenadiers were already outnumbered and were repulsed with heavy loss. Pike ordered an advance by platoons, supported by two 6-pounder field guns, which steadily drove back Sheaffe&#x27;s force. After Sheaffe failed to get the Fencibles to renew their advance, the British began to withdraw, with the newly arrived Glengarry Light Infantry covering the retreat.

During these landings, the American naval squadron bombarded the four gun batteries defending York. Chauncey&#x27;s schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, also bombarded the fort and Government House battery, with Chauncey himself directing them from a small boat. British return fire was ineffective.

The British tried to rally around the Western battery, but the battery&#x27;s travelling magazine (a portable chest containing cartridges) exploded, apparently as the result of an accident. This caused further loss (including 20 killed) and confusion among the British regulars, and they fell back to a ravine at Garrison Creek north of the fort, where the militia was forming up. American forces advanced east towards the fort, and assembled outside its walls, exchanging artillery fire with the fort. The naval squadron also bombarded the fort, having re-positioned themselves directly south of the fort&#x27;s stockade. Sheaffe decided that the battle was lost and ordered the regulars to retreat, setting fire to the wooden bridge over the River Don east of the town to thwart pursuit. The militia and several prominent citizens were left &quot;standing in the street like a parcel of sheep&quot;. Sheaffe instructed the militia to make the best terms they could with the Americans, but without informing the senior militia officers or any official of the legislature, he also dispatched Captain Tito LeLièvre of the Royal Newfoundland to set fire to the sloop-of-war HMS &quot;Sir Isaac Brock&quot; under construction at York&#x27;s Naval Shipyard and to blow up the fort&#x27;s magazine. The two sides continued to exchange artillery fire until Sheaffe&#x27;s withdrawal from the fort was complete. The British had left the flag flying over the fort as a ruse, and the Americans assembling outside its walls assumed that the fort was still occupied.

By 1:00 pm, the Americans were from the fort, and their artillery and the naval squadron were preparing to bombard it. Pike was questioning a prisoner as to how many troops were defending the fort. Shortly after the bombardment began, the magazine (which contained over 74 tons of iron shells and 300 barrels of gunpowder and had been rigged by the British to explode) blew up. The explosion threw debris over a radius. General Pike and 37 other American soldiers were killed by the explosion, which caused an additional 222 casualties. Fearing a counterattack after the explosion, American forces regrouped outside the wall, and did not advance onto the abandoned fort until after the British regulars had left the settlement.

===Casualties===
The American loss for the entire battle was officially reported as 52 killed and 254 wounded for the Army and 3 killed and 11 wounded for the Navy, for a total of 55 killed and 265 wounded. The majority of American casualties originated from the explosion at the fort&#x27;s powder magazine. An archaeological dig in 2012 unearthed evidence that the destruction of the magazine and the impact it had on American soldiers was a result of poor position, and bad luck. The Americans just happened to be at the exact distance of the shock wave and its debris field.

The British loss was officially reported by Sheaffe as 59 killed, 34 wounded, 43 wounded prisoners, 10 captured and seven missing, for a total of 153 casualties. However, historian Robert Malcomson has found this return to be inaccurate: it did not include militia, sailors, dockyard workers or Native Americans and was incorrect even as to the casualties of the regulars. Malcomson demonstrates that the actual British loss was 82 killed, 43 wounded, 69 wounded prisoners, 274 captured and seven missing, for a total of 475 casualties.

==Surrender==
Colonel William Chewett and Major William Allen of the 3rd York Regiment of militia tried to arrange a capitulation, assisted by Captain John Beverley Robinson, the acting Attorney General of Upper Canada. The process took time. The Americans were angry over their losses, particularly because they believed that the ship and fort had been destroyed after negotiations for surrender had already begun. Nevertheless, Colonel Mitchell of the 3rd U.S. Artillery agreed to terms. While they waited for Dearborn and Chauncey to ratify the terms, the surrendered militia was held prisoner in a blockhouse without food or medical attention for the few wounded. Forsyth&#x27;s company of the 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment was left as a guard in the town. At this stage, few Americans had entered the town.

The next morning, the terms had still not been ratified, since Dearborn had refused to leave the corvette &quot;Madison&quot;. When he eventually did, Reverend John Strachan (who held no official position other than Rector of York at the time) first brusquely tried to force him to sign the articles for capitulation on the spot, then accused Chauncey to his face of delaying the capitulation to allow the American troops licence to commit outrages. Eventually, Dearborn formally agreed to the articles for surrender. The official terms of surrender permitted civil servants to continue carrying out their duties, and surgeons to treat British wounded. As a part of the terms of surrender, any troops remaining in York became prisoners of war, although those serving in the militia were &quot;paroled,&quot; and allowed to return home so long as they do not rejoin the conflict until an official prisoner exchange had secured their &quot;release&quot;. Members of the York Militia were ordered to relinquish their arms, and proceed to Fort York garrison. The officers of the militia were subsequently released on &quot;parole,&quot; although the rest of the militia remained imprisoned for two days. Kept without food, water, or medical attention, the imprisoned militia was eventually released at the behest of Strachan.

The Americans took over the dockyard, where they captured a brig () in a poor state of repair, and twenty 24-pounder carronades and other stores intended for the British squadron on Lake Erie. &quot;Sir Isaac Brock&quot; was beyond salvage. The Americans had missed another ship-rigged vessel, , which carried 16 guns, as she sailed for Kingston to collect ordnance two days before the Americans had been sighted. The Americans also demanded and received several thousand pounds in Army Bills, which had been in the keeping of Prideaux Selby, the Receiver General of Upper Canada, who was mortally ill.

===Burning of York===
Between April 28 and 30, American troops carried out many acts of plunder. Some of them set fire to the buildings of the Legislative Assembly, and Government House, home to the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. It was alleged that the American troops had found a scalp there, though folklore had it that the &quot;scalp&quot; was actually the Speaker&#x27;s wig. The Parliamentary mace of Upper Canada was taken back to Washington and was only returned in 1934 as a goodwill gesture by President Franklin Roosevelt. The Printing Office, used for publishing official documents as well as newspapers, was vandalized and the printing press was smashed. Other Americans looted empty houses on the pretext that their absent owners were militia who had not given their parole as required by the articles of capitulation. The homes of Canadians connected with the Natives, including that of James Givins, were also looted regardless of their owners&#x27; status. Before they departed from York, the Americans razed most of the structures in the fort, except the barracks.
During the looting, several officers under Chauncey&#x27;s command took books from York&#x27;s first subscription library. After finding out his officers were in possession of looted library books, Chauncey had the books packed in two crates, and returned them to York, during the second incursion in July. However, by the time the books arrived, the library had closed, and the books were auctioned off in 1822. Several looted items ended up in the possession of the locals. Sheaffe later alleged that local settlers had unlawfully acquired government-owned farming tools or other stores looted and discarded by the Americans, and demanded that they be handed back.

The looting of York occurred in spite of Pike&#x27;s earlier orders that all civilian property be respected and that any soldier convicted of such transgressions would be executed. Dearborn similarly emphatically denied giving orders for any buildings to be destroyed and deplored the worst of the atrocities in his letters, but he was nonetheless unable or unwilling to rein in his soldiers. Dearborn himself was embarrassed by the looting, as it made a mockery of the terms of surrender he arranged. His soldiers&#x27; disregard for the terms he arranged, and local civil leaders&#x27; continued protest against them, made Dearborn eager to leave York as soon as all the captured stores were transported.

==Aftermath==
The Americans occupied the town for nearly two weeks. They sent the captured military stores, including 20 artillery pieces, away on May 2 but were then penned in York harbour by a gale. Chauncey&#x27;s vessels were so overcrowded with troops that only half of them could go below decks to escape the rain at any time. They left York on May 8, departing for the Niagara peninsula, where they required several weeks to recuperate. Sheaffe&#x27;s troops endured an equally miserable fourteen-day retreat overland to Kingston.

Around 300 to 400 Iroquois warriors assembled and marched towards York shortly after the battle, in an effort to launch an attack on the American forces there. The Iroquois were approximately west of York, in present-day Burlington, when they learned that the Americans had departed York, resulting in the expedition to be called off.

===Effects on the war===

Many members of the Provincial Assembly and other prominent citizens severely criticized Sheaffe, both for his conduct generally and during the fighting at York. For example, Militia officers Chewitt and Allan, the Reverend Strachan and others wrote to Governor General Prévost on May 8, that Sheaffe &quot;kept too far from his troops after retreating from the woods, never cheered or animated them, nor showed by his personal conduct that he was hearty in the cause.&quot; Sheaffe lost his military and public offices in Upper Canada as a result of his defeat.

However, the Americans had not inflicted crippling damage on the Provincial Marine on Lake Ontario, and they admitted that by preserving his small force of regulars rather than sacrificing them in a fight against heavy odds, Sheaffe had robbed the Americans of decisive victory. Secretary of War Armstrong wrote, &quot;[W]e cannot doubt but that in all cases in which a British commander is compelled to act defensively, his policy will be that adopted by Sheaffe – to prefer the preservation of his troops to that of his post, and thus carrying off the kernel leave us the shell.&quot;

The effects of the capture of York were probably most significant on Lake Erie, since the capture of the ordnance and supplies destined for the British squadron there contributed to the defeat of the British squadron at the Battle of Lake Erie. However, most of the naval supplies captured were not used by the Americans, who abandoned a portion of the captured goods before they departed from York, while the remaining supplies were set on fire during the Second Battle of Sacket&#x27;s Harbor in May 1813.

====Societal consequences====
As the American attack on York occurred on the first of New York&#x27;s three-day election period, the battle did not directly benefit the Democratic-Republic Party as Armstrong had originally envisioned. However, early proclamations of victory issued prior to the battle, did contribute to the reelection of Daniel D. Tompkins, the Democratic-Republican candidate to be the Governor of New York.

According to Pierre Berton, the battle, and occupation of York served as a watershed moment for the settlers of York. Those who fought the Americans became celebrated in the local community, while those who aided the occupation were viewed by the community as traitors. The documentary film &quot;Explosion 1812&quot; argues that the battle had a much greater impact than previously assumed. The mistreatment by US forces of the civilian Canadian population, dogged resistance by militia and the burning of British symbols and buildings after the battle led to a hardening of Canadian popular opinion against the United States.

Several commentators viewed the American transgressions at York as justification for the British Burning of Washington later in the war. Prévost wrote that &quot;as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate&quot;. Strachan wrote to Thomas Jefferson that the damage to Washington &quot;was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada&quot;.

==Later attacks==
===Second incursion, July 1813===
Chauncey and Dearborn subsequently won the Battle of Fort George on the Niagara peninsula, but they had left Sacket&#x27;s Harbor defended only by a few troops, mainly militia. When reinforcements from the Royal Navy commanded by Commodore James Lucas Yeo arrived in Kingston, Yeo almost immediately embarked some troops commanded by Prévost and attacked Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. Although the British were repelled by the defenders at the Second Battle of Sacket&#x27;s Harbor, Chauncey immediately withdrew into Sacket&#x27;s Harbor until mid-July, when a new heavy sloop-of-war had been completed.
Chauncey sortied again on July 21 with 13 vessels. Six days later, he embarked a battalion of 500 troops commanded by Colonel Winfield Scott at Niagara. Chauncey sought to relieve the British-Native blockade of Fort George, by attacking British supply lines at Burlington Heights at the western end of Lake Ontario. Winfield Scott&#x27;s force disembarked east of the heights at Burlington Beach (present-day Burlington) on July 29 but found the defenders too well entrenched for any assault to be successful.

Anticipating Chauncey&#x27;s intentions, Major-General Francis de Rottenburg, Sheaffe&#x27;s successor as Lieutenant Governor, ordered the bulk of the troops at York to Burlington Heights. However, this left York largely undefended, as most of its militia were still on parole. The American squadron proceeded to York in order to seize food stores to feed its soldiers. The last remaining troop in York, members of the 19th Light Dragoons, collected the military supplies they could carry and withdrew along the Don River. The American landing of 340 men at York was unopposed, with the American force burning the barracks at the fort and the military fuel yards, and looting several properties. They also seized 11 batteaux, 5 cannons and some flour, before reembarking on their ships, leaving the settlement later that night. The library books that were looted after the battle in April 1813, were returned to the settlement during the second incursion into York.

The Ontario Heritage Foundation erected a plaque in 1968 near the entrance to Coronation Park, Exhibition Place, Lake Shore Boulevard, in commemoration of the event. The plaque reads:

On the morning of July 31, 1813, a U.S. invasion fleet appeared off York (Toronto) after having withdrawn from a planned attack on British positions at Burlington Heights. That afternoon 300 American soldiers came ashore near here. Their landing was unopposed: there were no British regulars in town, and York&#x27;s militia had withdrawn from further combat in return for its freedom during the American invasion three months earlier. The invaders seized food and military supplies, then re-embarked. The next day they returned to investigate collaborators&#x27; reports that valuable stores were concealed up the Don River. Unsuccessful in their search, the Americans contented themselves with burning military installations on nearby Gibraltar Point before they departed.

===Third incursion, August 1814===
In the months after the second American incursion into York, the defences around the harbour were significantly improved, as the British needed to protect a four-vessel squadron that would be stationed at the town&#x27;s harbour. On August 6, 1814, the American Lake Ontario squadron pursued HMS &quot;Magnet&quot;, before its captain set fire to the ship, preventing its capture. Suspecting the ship sailed from York, the American naval squadron made its way to the settlement in order to evaluate the situation, and discover if any more ships could be captured there.

Arriving near York&#x27;s harbour, the American squadron dispatched to negotiate under a white flag, in a ploy to evaluate the town&#x27;s defences. However, the militia stationed at Fort York opened fire at the schooner, which returned fire, before withdrawing to rejoin the American squadron. The 8th Regiment of Foot, and the 82nd Regiment of Foot were sent to York to bolster the town&#x27;s defences. The American squadron did not engage the newly built defences, although they remained outside York&#x27;s harbour for the next three days before sailing away.

==Legacy==
The burning and looting of York after the battle, along with the destruction of other Upper Canadian settlements during the war, saw public opinions on Americans shift among the residents of Upper Canada. Historian, Charles Perry Stacey notes in the years before the war, American settlers had regularly settled into Upper Canada, with the colony essentially becoming a &quot;transnational space,&quot; and the only distinction between Americans and Upper Canadians existing on paper. However, in the years after the war, Stacey notes a &quot;deep prejudice against the United States,&quot; had emerged amongst the colony&#x27;s settlers. Stacey further notes that the burning of York, and other American transgressions during the war, were later used by Canadian nationalists to create a national narrative that sees the &quot;birth of the Canadian nation,&quot; as a result of the conflict.
Several Canadian Army Reserve units perpetuate the linages of Fencibles, and militia units involved in the Battle of York, including the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders (Glengarry Light Infantry), the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers (1st and 3rd regiments of the York Militia), and the Royal Newfoundland Regiment (Royal Newfoundland Fencibles). Five active regular battalions of the United States Army (2-1 ADA, 1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-5 Inf and 2-5 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of several American units engaged during the Battle of York (including Crane&#x27;s Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, and the old 6th, 16th, and 21st Infantry Regiments). Within the British Army, the 8th Regiment of Foot is today perpetuated by the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment while the 49th Regiment of Foot is perpetuated by The Rifles Regiment.

On July 1, 1902, Walter Seymour Allward was commissioned to sculpt the Defence of York monument at the Fort York burial grounds. The monument was erected to commemorate those that fought in defence of York; as well as the British, Canadian, and Native warriors who fought in the War of 1812.

On April 27, 2013, the City of Toronto government and the Canadian Armed Forces commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle with a Presentation of Colours to the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. The ceremony took place at Queen&#x27;s Park, and was presided over by Prince Philip. The ceremony was followed by a military parade of 1,500 sailors and soldiers from the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Navy; from Queen&#x27;s Park to Fort York. The ceremony and parade was organize in conjunction with other War of 1812 bicentennial commemorations held in Toronto, and the other municipalities in Ontario. During the bicentennial celebrations, the City of Toronto Museum Services commissioned the creation of the exhibit &quot;Finding the Fallen: the Battle of York Remembered&quot; at Fort York. The exhibit attempts to document American, British (including the militia), and First Nations combatants that died during the battle.

<text>Neil Devindra Bissoondath (born 19 April 1955, in Arima, Trinidad and Tobago) is a Trinidadian-Canadian author who lives in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. He is a noted writer of fiction. He is an outspoken critic of Canada&#x27;s system of multiculturalism, and is the nephew of authors V. S. Naipaul, Shiva Naipaul, and Savi Naipaul Akal; grandson of Seepersad Naipaul; grandnephew of Rudranath Capildeo and Simbhoonath Capildeo; and cousin of Vahni Capildeo.

==Life and career==
Bissoondath attended St. Mary&#x27;s College in Trinidad and Tobago, where he was born in Arima. Although he was from a Hindu tradition, he was able to adapt to a Catholic high school. He describes himself as not very religious and distrustful of dogma. In the early 1970s, political upheaval and economic collapse had created a climate of chaos and violence in the island nation.

In 1973, at the age of 18, Bissoondath left Trinidad and settled in Ontario, where he studied at York University and received a Bachelor of Arts in French in 1977. He then taught English and French at the Inlingua School of Languages and the Toronto Language Workshop. He won the McClelland and Stewart award and the National Magazine award, both in 1986, for the short story &quot;Dancing&quot;. Bissoondath was interviewed by Ali Lakhani in the journal &quot;Rungh&quot; about his views on writing and life.

==Awards==
He won the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada&#x27;s Gordon Montador Award in 1995 for &quot;Selling Illusions&quot;.

Bissoondath has received honorary doctorates from Glendon College, York University and Université de Moncton. In 2010 he was made a Chevalier of the Ordre national du Québec. In 2012, he was awarded the NALIS (National Library of Trinidad and Tobago) Lifetime Literary Achievement Award.

<text>Microfinance consists of financial services targeting individuals and small businesses (SMEs) who lack access to conventional banking and related services. 

Microfinance includes microcredit, the provision of small loans to poor clients; savings and checking accounts; microinsurance; and payment systems, among other services. 

Microfinance product and services in MFI include:
# Savings 
# Microcredit 
# Microinsurance 
# Microleasing and 
# Fund transfer/remittance.

Microfinance services are designed to reach excluded customers, usually low income population segments, possibly socially marginalized, or geographically more isolated, and to help them become self-sufficient. ID Ghana is an example of a microfinance institution.

Microfinance initially had a limited definition: the provision of microloans to small scale entrepreneurs and small (informal sectors) businesses lacking access to credit. The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients were: 

(1) relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses; and 

(2) group-based model, where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group. Over time, microfinance has emerged as a larger movement whose object is: &quot;a world in which as everyone, especially the lower income classes and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable, high quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and fund transfers.&quot;

Proponents of microfinance often claim that such access will help struggling classes out of poverty, including participants in the Microcredit Summit Campaign. For many, microfinance is a way to promote economic development, employment and growth through the support of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses; for others it is a way for the disadvantaged/less privileged to manage their finances more effectively and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing the risks. Critics often point to some of the ills of microcredit that can create indebtedness. Many studies have tried to assess its impacts.

New research in the area of microfinance calls for better understanding of the microfinance ecosystem so that the microfinance institutions and other facilitators can formulate sustainable strategies that will help create social benefits through better service delivery to the low-income population.

== History ==
Over the past centuries, practical visionaries, from the Franciscan friars who founded the community-oriented pawnshops of the 15th century to the founders of the European credit union movement in the 19th century (such as Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen) and the founders of the microcredit movement in the 1970s (such as Muhammad Yunus and Al Whittaker), have tested practices and built institutions designed to bring the kinds of opportunities and risk-management tools that financial services can provide to the doorsteps of poor people.

The history of microfinancing can be traced back as far as the middle of the 1800s, when the theorist Lysander Spooner was writing about the benefits of small credits to entrepreneurs and farmers as a way of getting the people out of poverty. Independently of Spooner, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural Germany.

The modern use of the expression &quot;microfinancing&quot; has roots in the 1970s when Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, founded by microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus, was starting and shaping the modern industry of microfinancing. The approach of microfinance was institutionalized by Yunus in 1976, with the foundation of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Another pioneer in this sector is Pakistani social scientist Akhtar Hameed Khan.

Since people in the developing world still largely depend on subsistence farming or basic food trade for their livelihood, significant resources have gone into supporting smallholder agriculture in developing countries.

== Poverty ==

In developing economies, and particularly in rural areas, many activities that would be classified in the developed world as financial are not monetized: that is, money is not used to carry them out. This is often the case when people need the services money can provide but do not have dispensable funds required for those services. This forces them to revert to other means of acquiring the funds.
In their book, &quot;The Poor and Their Money&quot;, Stuart Rutherford and Sukhwinder Arora cite several types of needs:
* &quot;Lifecycle Needs&quot;: such as weddings, funerals, childbirth, education, home building, holidays, festivals, widowhood and old age
* &quot;Personal Emergencies&quot;: such as sickness, injury, unemployment, theft, harassment or death
* &quot;Disasters&quot;: such as wildfires, floods, cyclones and man-made events like war or bulldozing of dwellings
* &quot;Investment Opportunities&quot;: expanding a business, buying land or equipment, improving housing, securing a job, etc.
People find creative and often collaborative ways to meet these needs, primarily through creating and exchanging different forms of non-cash value. Common substitutes for cash vary from country to country, but typically include livestock, grains, jewelry and precious metals.
As Marguerite S. Robinson describes in his book, &quot;The Micro Finance Revolution: Sustainable Finance for the Poor&quot;, the 1980s demonstrated that &quot;micro finance could provide large-scale outreach profitably&quot;, and in the 1990s, &quot;micro finance began to develop as an industry&quot;.
In the 2000s, the microfinance industry&#x27;s objective was to satisfy the unmet demand on a much larger scale, and to play a role in reducing poverty. While much progress has been made in developing a viable, commercial microfinance sector in the last few decades, several issues remain that need to be addressed before the industry will be able to satisfy massive worldwide demand.
The obstacles or challenges in building a sound commercial microfinance industry include:
* Inappropriate donor subsidies
* Poor regulation and supervision of deposit-taking microfinance institutions (MFIs)
* Few MFIs that meet the needs for savings, remittances or insurance
* Limited management capacity in MFIs
* Institutional inefficiencies
* Need for more dissemination and adoption of rural, agricultural microfinance methodologies
* Members&#x27; lack of collateral to secure a loan

Microfinance is the proper tool to reduce income inequality, allowing citizens from lower socio-economical classes to participate in the economy. Moreover, its involvement has shown to lead to a downward trend in income inequality.

== Ways in which poor people manage their money ==
Rutherford argues that the basic problem that poor people face as money managers is to gather a &quot;usefully large&quot; amount of money. Building a new home may involve saving and protecting diverse building materials for years until enough are available to proceed with construction. Children&#x27;s schooling may be funded by buying chickens and raising them for sale as needed for expenses, uniforms, bribes, etc. Because all the value is accumulated before it is needed, this money management strategy is referred to as &quot;saving up&quot;.

Often, people do not have enough money when they face a need, so they borrow. A poor family might borrow from relatives to buy land, from a moneylender to buy rice, or from a microfinance institution to buy a sewing machine. Since these loans must be repaid by saving after the cost is incurred, Rutherford calls this &#x27;saving down&#x27;. Rutherford&#x27;s point is that microcredit is addressing only half the problem, and arguably the less important half: poor people borrow to help them save and accumulate assets. However, microfinance is not the magical solution to take people out of poverty; it is merely a tool that the poor can use to raise their prospects for an escape from poverty.
Most needs are met through a mix of saving and credit. A benchmark impact assessment of Grameen Bank and two other large microfinance institutions in Bangladesh found that for every $1 they were lending to clients to finance rural non-farm micro-enterprise, about $2.50 came from other sources, mostly their clients&#x27; savings. This parallels the experience in the West, in which family businesses are funded mostly from savings, especially during start-up.

Recent studies have also shown that informal methods of saving are unsafe. For example, a study by Wright and Mutesasira in Uganda concluded that &quot;those with no option but to save in the informal sector are almost bound to lose some money—probably around one quarter of what they save there&quot;.

The work of Rutherford, Wright and others has caused practitioners to reconsider a key aspect of the microcredit paradigm: that poor people get out of poverty by borrowing, building microenterprises and increasing their income. The new paradigm places more attention on the efforts of poor people to reduce their many vulnerabilities by keeping more of what they earn and building up their assets.

== Examples ==
The microfinance project of &quot;saving up&quot; is exemplified in the slums of the south-eastern city of Vijayawada, India. This microfinance project functions as an unofficial banking system where Jyothi, a &quot;deposit collector&quot;, collects money from slum dwellers, mostly women, in order for them to accumulate savings. Jyothi does her rounds throughout the city, collecting Rs5 a day from people in the slums for 220 days, however not always 220 days in a row since these women do not always have the funds available to put them into savings. They ultimately end up with Rs1000 at the end of the process. However, there are some issues with this microfinance saving program. One of the issues is that while saving, clients are actually losing part of their savings. Jyothi takes interest from each client—about 20 out of every 220 payments, or Rs100 out of 1,100 or 9%. When these slum dwellers find someone they trust, they are willing to pay up to 30% to someone to safely collect and keep their savings. There is also the risk of entrusting their savings to unlicensed, informal, peripatetic collectors. However, the slum dwellers are willing to accept this risk because they are unable to save at home, and unable to use the remote and unfriendly banks in their country. This microfinance project also has many benefits, such as empowering women and giving parents the ability to save money for their children&#x27;s education. This specific microfinance project is an example of the benefits and limitations of the &quot;saving up&quot; project.

The microfinance project of &quot;saving through&quot; is shown in Nairobi, Kenya which includes a Rotating Savings and Credit Associations or ROSCAs initiative. This is a small scale example, however Rutherford (2009) describes a woman he met in Nairobi and studied her ROSCA. Every day 15 women would save 100 shillings so there would be a lump sum of 1,500 shillings and every day 1 of the 15 women would receive that lump sum. This would continue for 15 days and another woman within this group would receive the lump sum. At the end of the 15 days a new cycle would start. This ROSCA initiative is different from the &quot;saving up&quot; example above because there are no interest rates affiliated with the ROSCA, additionally everyone receives back what they put forth. This initiative requires trust and social capital networks in order to work, so often these ROSCAs include people who know each other and have reciprocity. The ROSCA allows for marginalized groups to receive a lump sum at one time in order to pay or save for specific needs they have.

==Debates and challenges==

There are several key debates at the boundaries of microfinance.

===Loan pricing===
Before determining loan prices, one should take into account the following costs: 1) administrative costs by the bank (MFI) and 2) transaction cost by the client/customer. Customers, on the other hand, may have expenses for travelling to the bank branch, acquiring official documents for the loan application, and loss of time when dealing with the MFI (&quot;opportunity costs&quot;). Hence, from a customer&#x27;s point of view the cost of a loan is not only the interest and fees she/he has to pay, but also all other transaction costs that she/he has to cover.

One of the principal challenges of microfinance is providing small loans at an affordable cost. The global average interest and fee rate is estimated at 37%, with rates reaching as high as 70% in some markets. The reason for the high interest rates is not primarily cost of capital. Indeed, the local microfinance organizations that receive zero-interest loan capital from the online microlending platform Kiva charge average interest and fee rates of 35.21%. Rather, the main reason for the high cost of microfinance loans is the high transaction cost of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size.

Microfinance practitioners have long argued that such high interest rates are simply unavoidable, because the cost of making each loan cannot be reduced below a certain level while still allowing the lender to cover costs such as offices and staff salaries. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa credit risk for microfinance institutes is very high, because customers need years to improve their livelihood and face many challenges during this time. Financial institutes often do not even have a system to check the person&#x27;s identity. Additionally, they are unable to design new products and enlarge their business to reduce the risk. The result is that the traditional approach to microfinance has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world&#x27;s poorest people pay the world&#x27;s highest cost for small business growth capital. The high costs of traditional microfinance loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Offering loans at interest and fee rates of 37% mean that borrowers who do not manage to earn at least a 37% rate of return may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans.
According to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans. Some resorted to measures such as reducing their food intake or taking children out of school in order to repay microfinance debts that had not proven sufficiently profitable. 

In recent years, the microfinance industry has shifted its focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably. Microfinance analyst David Roodman contends that, in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time. However, global average interest rates for microfinance loans are still well above 30%.

The answer to providing microfinance services at an affordable cost may lie in rethinking one of the fundamental assumptions underlying microfinance: that microfinance borrowers need extensive monitoring and interaction with loan officers in order to benefit from and repay their loans. The P2P microlending service Zidisha is based on this premise, facilitating direct interaction between individual lenders and borrowers via an internet community rather than physical offices. Zidisha has managed to bring the cost of microloans to below 10% for borrowers, including interest which is paid out to lenders. However, it remains to be seen whether such radical alternative models can reach the scale necessary to compete with traditional microfinance programs.

===Use of loans===
Practitioners and donors from the charitable side of microfinance frequently argue for restricting microcredit to loans for productive purposes—such as to start or expand a microenterprise. Those from the private-sector side respond that, because money is fungible, such a restriction is impossible to enforce, and that in any case it should not be up to rich people to determine how poor people use their money.

===Reach versus depth of impact===

There has been a long-standing debate over the sharpness of the trade-off between &#x27;outreach&#x27; (the ability of a microfinance institution to reach poorer and more remote people) and its &#x27;sustainability&#x27; (its ability to cover its operating costs—and possibly also its costs of serving new clients—from its operating revenues). Although it is generally agreed that microfinance practitioners should seek to balance these goals to some extent, there are a wide variety of strategies, ranging from the minimalist profit-orientation of BancoSol in Bolivia to the highly integrated not-for-profit orientation of BRAC in Bangladesh. This is true not only for individual institutions, but also for governments engaged in developing national microfinance systems. BRAC was ranked the number one NGO in the world in 2015 and 2016 by the Geneva-based NGO Advisor.

===Women===
Microfinance provides women around the world with financial and non-financial services, especially in the most rural areas that do not have access to traditional banking and other basic financial infrastructure. It creates opportunities for women to start-up and build their businesses using their own skills and talents.

Utilizing savings, credit, and microinsurance, Microfinance helps families create income-generating activities and better cope with risk. Women particularly benefit from microfinance as many microfinance institutions (MFIs) target female clients. Most microfinance institutions (MFIs) partner with other organizations like Water.org and Habitat for Humanity to provide additional services for their clients.

Microfinance generally agree that women should be the primary focus of service delivery. Evidence shows that they are less likely to default on their loans than men. Industry data from 2006 for 704 MFIs reaching 52 million borrowers includes MFIs using the solidarity lending methodology (99.3% female clients) and MFIs using individual lending (51% female clients). The delinquency rate for solidarity lending was 0.9% after 30 days (individual lending—3.1%), while 0.3% of loans were written off (individual lending—0.9%). Because operating margins become tighter the smaller the loans delivered, many MFIs consider the risk of lending to men to be too high. This focus on women is questioned sometimes, however a recent study of microentrepreneurs from Sri Lanka published by the World Bank found that the return on capital for male-owned businesses (half of the sample) averaged 11%, whereas the return for women-owned businesses was 0% or slightly negative.

Microfinance&#x27;s emphasis on female-oriented lending is the subject of controversy, as it is claimed that microfinance improves the status of women through an alleviation of poverty. It is argued that by providing women with initial capital, they will be able to support themselves independent of men, in a manner which would encourage sustainable growth of enterprise and eventual self-sufficiency. This claim has yet to be proven in any substantial form. Moreover, the attraction of women as a potential investment base is precisely because they are constrained by socio-cultural norms regarding such concepts of obedience, familial duty, household maintenance and passivity. The result of these norms is that while micro-lending may enable women to improve their daily subsistence to a more steady pace, they will not be able to engage in market-oriented business practice beyond a limited scope of low-skilled, low-earning, informal work. Part of this is a lack of permissivity in the society; part a reflection of the added burdens of household maintenance that women shoulder alone as a result of microfinancial empowerment; and part a lack of training and education surrounding gendered conceptions of economics. In particular, the shift in norms such that women continue to be responsible for all the domestic private sphere labour as well as undertaking public economic support for their families, independent of male aid increases rather than decreases burdens on already limited persons.

If there were to be an exchange of labour, or if women&#x27;s income were supplemental rather than essential to household maintenance, there might be some truth to claims of establishing long-term businesses; however when so constrained it is impossible for women to do more than pay off a current loan only to take on another in a cyclic pattern which is beneficial to the financier but hardly to the borrower. This gender essentializing crosses over from institutionalized lenders such as the Grameen Bank into interpersonal direct lending through charitable crowd-funding operations, such as Kiva. More recently, the popularity of non-profit global online lending has grown, suggesting that a redress of gender norms might be instituted through individual selection fomented by the processes of such programs, but the reality is as yet uncertain. Studies have noted that the likelihood of lending to women, individually or in groups, is 38% higher than rates of lending to men.

This is also due to a general trend for interpersonal microfinance relations to be conducted on grounds of similarity and internal/external recognition: lenders want to see something familiar, something supportable in potential borrowers, so an emphasis on family, goals of education and health, and a commitment to community all achieve positive results from prospective financiers. Unfortunately, these labels disproportionately align with women rather than men, particularly in the developing world. The result is that microfinance continues to rely on restrictive gender norms rather than seek to subvert them through economic redress in terms of foundation change: training, business management and financial education are all elements which might be included in parameters of female-aimed loans and until they are the fundamental reality of women as a disadvantaged section of societies in developing states will go untested.

===Benefits and limitations===
One of the benefits of microfinancing for poverty stricken and low-income households is that it is accessible. Banks today will not extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally do not engage in small size loans typically associated with microfinancing. Microfinancing is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the microfinancing initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving microfinancing are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, people are more likely to open small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs. Overall, the benefits outline that the microfinancing initiative is set out to improve the standard of living amongst impoverished communities.

There are also many social and financial challenges for microfinance initiatives. For example, more articulate and better-off community members may cheat poorer or less-educated neighbours. This may occur intentionally or inadvertently through loosely run organizations. As a result, many microfinance initiatives require a large amount of social capital or trust in order to work effectively. The ability of poorer people to save may also fluctuate over time as unexpected costs may take priority which could result in them being able to save little or nothing some weeks. Rates of inflation may cause funds to lose their value, thus financially harming the saver and not benefiting the collector.

While the success of the Grameen Bank (which now serves over 7 million poor Bangladeshi women) has inspired the world, it has proved difficult to replicate this success. In nations with lower population densities, meeting the operating costs of a retail branch by serving nearby customers has proven considerably more challenging. Hans Dieter Seibel, board member of the European Microfinance Platform, is in favour of the group model. This particular model (used by many Microfinance institutions) makes financial sense, he says, because it reduces transaction costs. Microfinance programmes also need to be based on local funds.

==Standards and principles==
Poor people borrow from informal moneylenders and save with informal collectors. They receive loans and grants from charities. They buy insurance from state-owned companies. They receive funds transfers through formal or informal remittance networks. It is not easy to distinguish microfinance from similar activities. It could be claimed that a government that orders state banks to open deposit accounts for poor consumers, or a moneylender that engages in usury, or a charity that runs a heifer pool are engaged in microfinance. Ensuring financial services to poor people is best done by expanding the number of financial institutions available to them, as well as by strengthening the capacity of those institutions. In recent years there has also been increasing emphasis on expanding the diversity of institutions, since different institutions serve different needs.

Some principles that summarize a century and a half of development practice were encapsulated in 2004 by CGAP and endorsed by the Group of Eight leaders at the G8 Summit on 10 June 2004:
#Poor people need not just loans but also savings, insurance and money transfer services.
#Microfinance must be useful to poor households: helping them raise income, build up assets and/or cushion themselves against external shocks.
#&quot;Microfinance can pay for itself.&quot; Subsidies from donors and government are scarce and uncertain and so, to reach large numbers of poor people, microfinance must pay for itself.
#Microfinance means building permanent local institutions.
#Microfinance also means integrating the financial needs of poor people into a country&#x27;s mainstream financial system.
#&quot;The job of government is to enable financial services, not to provide them.&quot;
#&quot;Donor funds should complement private capital, not compete with it.&quot;
#&quot;The key is the shortage of strong institutions and managers.&quot; Donors should focus on capacity building.
#Interest rate ceilings hurt poor people by preventing microfinance institutions from covering their costs, which chokes off the supply of credit.
#Microfinance institutions should measure and disclose their performance – both financially and socially.

Microfinance is considered a tool for socio-economic development, and can be clearly distinguished from charity. Families who are destitute, or so poor they are unlikely to be able to generate the cash flow required to repay a loan, should be recipients of charity. Others are best served by financial institutions.

==Scale of operations==

No systematic effort to map the distribution of microfinance has yet been undertaken. A benchmark was established by an analysis of &#x27;alternative financial institutions&#x27; in the developing world in 2004. The authors counted approximately 665 million client accounts at over 3,000 institutions that are serving people who are poorer than those served by the commercial banks. Of these accounts, 120 million were with institutions normally understood to practice microfinance. Reflecting the diverse historical roots of the movement, however, they also included postal savings banks (318 million accounts), state agricultural and development banks (172 million accounts), financial cooperatives and credit unions (35 million accounts) and specialized rural banks (19 million accounts).

Regionally, the highest concentration of these accounts was in India (188 million accounts representing 18% of the total national population). The lowest concentrations were in Latin America and the Caribbean (14 million accounts representing 3% of the total population) and Africa (27 million accounts representing 4% of the total population, with the highest rate of penetration in West Africa, and the highest growth rate in Eastern and Southern Africa ). Considering that most bank clients in the developed world need several active accounts to keep their affairs in order, these figures indicate that the task the microfinance movement has set for itself is still very far from finished.

By type of service, &quot;savings accounts in alternative finance institutions outnumber loans by about four to one. This is a worldwide pattern that does not vary much by region.&quot;

An important source of detailed data on selected microfinance institutions is the &quot;MicroBanking Bulletin&quot;, which is published by Microfinance Information Exchange. At the end of 2009, it was tracking 1,084 MFIs that were serving 74 million borrowers ($38 billion in outstanding loans) and 67 million savers ($23 billion in deposits).

Another source of information regarding the environment of microfinance is the Global Microscope on the Microfinance Business Environment, prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the Inter-American Development Bank, and others. The 2011 report contains information on the environment of microfinance in 55 countries among two categories, the regulatory framework and the supporting institutional framework. This publication, also known as the Microscope, was first developed in 2007, focusing only on Latin America and the Caribbean, but by 2009, this report had become a global study.

As yet there are no studies that indicate the scale or distribution of &#x27;informal&#x27; microfinance organizations like ROSCA&#x27;s and informal associations that help people manage costs like weddings, funerals and sickness. Numerous case studies have been published, however, indicating that these organizations, which are generally designed and managed by poor people themselves with little outside help, operate in most countries in the developing world.

Help can come in the form of more and better-qualified staff; thus, higher education is needed for microfinance institutions. This has begun in some universities, as Oliver Schmidt describes.

==Ecosystem==

In recent years, there have been calls for better understanding of the ecosystem of microfinance. The practitioners and researchers felt that it was important to understand the ecosystem in which microfinance institutions operated in order for the market system actors and facilitators to understand what they have to do to achieve their objectives of participating in the ecosystem. Professors Debapratim Purkayastha, Trilochan Tripathy and Biswajit Das have designed a model for the ecosystem of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in India. The researchers mapped the ecosystem and found the ecosystem to be very complicated, with complex interactions among numerous actors themselves, and their environment. This ecosystem framework can be used by MFIs to understand the ecosystem of microfinance and formulate strategy. It can also help other stakeholders such as donors, investors, banks, government, etc. to formulate their own strategies relating to this sector.

==In the United States and Canada==
In Canada and the US, microfinance organizations target marginalized populations unable to access mainstream bank financing. Close to 8% of Americans are unbanked, meaning around 9 million are without any kind of bank account or formal financial services. Most of these institutions are structured as nonprofit organizations. Microloans in the U.S. context is defined as the extension of credit up to $50,000. In Canada, CRA guidelines restrict microfinance loans to a maximum of $25,000. The average microfinance loan size in the US is US$9,732, ten times the size of an average microfinance loan in developing countries (US$973).

===Impact===
While all microfinance institutions aim at increasing incomes and employment, in developing countries the empowerment of women, improved nutrition and improved education of the borrower&#x27;s children are frequently aims of microfinance institutions. In the US and Canada, aims of microfinance include the graduation of recipients from welfare programs and an improvement in their credit rating. In the US, microfinance has created jobs directly and indirectly, as 60% of borrowers were able to hire others. According to reports, every domestic microfinance loan creates 2.4 jobs. These entrepreneurs provide wages that are, on average, 25% higher than minimum wage. Small business loans eventually allow small business owners to make their businesses their primary source of income, with 67% of the borrowers showing a significant increase in their income as a result of their participation in certain micro-loan programs. In addition, these business owners are able to improve their housing situation, 70% indicating their housing has improved. Ultimately, many of the small business owners that use social funding are able to graduate from government funding.

===United States===
In the late 1980s, microfinance institutions developed in the United States. They served low-income and marginalized minority communities. By 2007, there were 500 microfinance organizations operating in the US with 200 lending capital.

There were three key factors that triggered the growth in domestic microfinance:
# Change in social welfare policies and focus on economic development and job creation at the macro level.
# Encouragement of employment, including self-employment, as a strategy for improving the lives of the poor.
# The increase in the proportion of Latin American and Asian immigrants who came from societies where microenterprises are prevalent.
These factors incentivized the public and private supports to have microlending activity in the United States.

===Canada===
Microfinance in Canada took shape through the development of credit unions. These credit unions provided financial services to the Canadians who could not get access to traditional financial means. Two separate branches of credit unions developed in Canada to serve the financially marginalized segment of the population. Alphonse Desjardins introduced the establishment of savings and credit services in late 1900 to the Quebecois who did not have financial access. Approximately 30 years later Father Moses Coady introduced credit unions to Nova Scotia. These were the models of the modern institutions still present in Canada today.

Efforts to transfer specific microfinance innovations such as solidarity lending from developing countries to Canada have met with little success.

Selected microfinance institutions in Canada are:
*Rise Asset Development
Founded by Sandra Rotman in 2009, Rise is a Rotman and CAMH initiative that provides small business loans, leases, and lines of credit to entrepreneurs with mental health and addiction challenges.
*Alterna Savings
Formed in 2005 through the merging of the Civil Service Savings and Loan Society and the Metro Credit Union, Alterna is a financial alternative to Canadians. Their banking policy is based on cooperative values and expert financial advising.
*Access Community Capital Fund

====Limitations====

Complications specific to Canada include the need for loans of a substantial size in comparison to the ones typically seen in many international microfinance initiatives. Microfinance is also limited by the rules and limitations surrounding money-lending. For example, Canada Revenue Agency limits the loans made in these sort of transactions to a maximum of $25,000. As a result, many people look to banks to provide these loans. Also, microfinance in Canada is driven by profit which, as a result, fails to advance the social development of community members. Within marginalized or impoverished Canadian communities, banks may not be readily accessible to deposit or take out funds. These banks which would have charged little or no interest on small amounts of cash are replaced by lending companies. Here, these companies may charge extremely large interest rates to marginalized community members thus increasing the cycle of poverty and profiting off of another&#x27;s loss.

In Canada, microfinancing competes with pay-day loans institutions which take advantage of marginalized and low-income individuals by charging extremely high, predatory interest rates. Communities with low social capital often do not have the networks to implement and support microfinance initiatives, leading to the proliferation of pay day loan institutions. Pay day loan companies are unlike traditional microfinance in that they don&#x27;t encourage collectivism and social capital building in low income communities, however exist solely for profit.
==Networks and associations==
There are several professional networks of microfinance institutions, and organisations that support microfinance and financial inclusion.

===MicroFinance Network===
The Microfinance Network is a network of 20 to 25 of the world&#x27;s largest microfinance institutions, spread across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Latin America. Established in 1993, the Microfinance Network provided support to members that helped steer many industry leaders to sustainability, and profitability in many of their largest markets. Today as the sector enters a new period of transition, with the rise of digital financial technology that increasingly competes with traditional microfinance institutions, the Microfinance Network provides a space to discuss opportunities and challenges that arise from emerging technological innovations in inclusive finance. The Microfinance Network convenes once a year. Members include Al Majmoua, BRAC, BancoSol, Gentera, Kamurj, LAPO, and SOGESOL.
Microfinance services including Easy Paisa by Telenor and Temeer Microfinance Bank, Jazz Cash by Jazz Telecom, and Zindigi have all been introduced by various telecom companies in Pakistan. These services provide lending services, retailer services, and online money transfer capabilities.

===Partnership for Responsible Financial Inclusion===
The Partnership for Responsible Financial, previously known as the Microfinance CEO Working Group, is a collaborative effort of leading international organizations and their CEOs active in the microfinance and inclusive finance space, including direct microfinance practitioners, and microfinance funders. It consists of 10 members, including Accion, Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance, BRAC, CARE USA, FINCA Impact Finance, Grameen Foundation, Opportunity International, Pro Mujer, Vision Fund International and Women&#x27;s World Banking. Harnessing the power of the CEOs and their senior managers, the PRFI advocates for responsible financial services and seeks catalytic opportunities to accelerate financial access to the unserved. As part of this focus, PRFI is responsible for setting up the Smart Campaign, in response to negative microfinance practices that indicated the mistreatment of clients in certain markets. The network is made up of the CEO working group, that meet quarterly and several subcommittee working groups dedicated to communications, social performance, digital financial services, and legal and human resources issues.

===European Microfinance Network===
The European Microfinance Network (EMN) was established in response to many legal and political obstacles affecting the microfinance sector in Europe. The Network is involved in advocacy on a wide range of issues related to microfinance, micro-enterprises, social and financial exclusion, self-employment and employment creation. Its main activity is the organisation of its annual conference, which has taken place each year since 2004. The EMN has a wide network of over 100 members.

===Microfinance Centre===
The Microfinance Centre (MFC) has a membership of over 100 organisations, and is particularly strong in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and Central Asia.

===Africa Microfinance Network (AFMIN)===
The Africa Microfinance Network (AFMIN) is an association of microfinance networks in Africa resulting from an initiative led by African microfinance practitioners to create and strengthen country-level microfinance networks for the purpose of establishing shared performance standards, institutional capacity and policy change. 
AFMIN was formally launched in November 2000 and has established its secretariat in Abidjan (Republic of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire), where AFMIN is legally recognized as an international Non-Governmental Organisation pursuant to Ivorian laws. Because of the political unrest in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, AFMIN temporarily relocated its office to Cotonou in Benin.

==Inclusive financial systems==
The microcredit movement that began in the 1970s has emerged and morphed into a &#x27;financial systems&#x27; approach for creating universal financial inclusion. While the Grameen model of delivering small credit achieved a great deal, especially in urban and near-urban areas and with entrepreneurial families, its progress in delivering financial services in less densely populated rural areas was slow, creating the need for many and multiple models to emerge across the globe. The terms have evolved from microcredit, to microfinance, and now financial inclusion. Specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs) continue to expand their services, collaborating and competing with banks, credit unions, mobile money, and other informal and formal member-owned institutions.

The new financial systems approach pragmatically acknowledges the richness of centuries of microfinance history and the immense diversity of institutions serving poor people in developing and developed economies today. It is also rooted in an increasing awareness of diversity of the financial service needs of the world&#x27;s poorest people, and the diverse settings in which they live and work. It also acknowledges that quality and range of financial services are also important for the banking system to achieve fuller and deeper financial inclusion, for all. Central banks and mainstream banks are now more intimately engaging in the financial inclusion agenda than ever before, though it is a long road, with 35–40% of world&#x27;s adults remaining outside formal banking system, and many more remaining &quot;under-banked&quot;. Advent of mobile-phone-based money management and digital finance is changing the scenario fast; though &quot;social distance&quot; between the economically poor or social marginalized and the banking system remains large.

; Informal financial service providers
: These include moneylenders, pawnbrokers, savings collectors, money-guards, ROSCAs, ASCAs and input supply shops. These continue their services because they know each other well and live in the same community, they understand each other&#x27;s financial circumstances and can offer very flexible, convenient and fast services. These services can also be costly and the choice of financial products limited and very short-term. Informal services that involve savings are also risky; many people lose their money.
; Member-owned organizations
: These include self-help groups, Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs), credit unions, CVECAs and a variety of other members owned and governed informal or formal financial institutions. Informal groups, like their more traditional cousins, are generally small and local, which means they have access to good knowledge about each other&#x27;s financial circumstances and can offer convenience and flexibility. Since they are managed by poor people, their costs of operation are low. Often, they do not need regulation and supervision, unless they grow in scale and formalize themselves by coming together to form II or III tier federations. If not prepared well, they can be &#x27;captured&#x27; by a few influential leaders, and run the risk of members losing their savings. Experience suggests though that these informal but highly disciplined groups are very sustainable, and continue to exist even after 20–25 years. Formalization, as a Cooperative of Credit Union, can help create links with the banking system for more sophisticated financial products and additional capital for loans; but requires strong leadership and systems. These models are highly popular in many rural regions of countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and a platform for creating deeper financial inclusion.
; NGOs
: The Microcredit Summit Campaign counted 3,316 of these MFIs and NGOs lending to about 133 million clients by the end of 2006. Led by Grameen Bank and BRAC in Bangladesh, Prodem in Bolivia, Opportunity International, and FINCA International, headquartered in Washington, DC, these NGOs have spread around the developing world in the past three decades; others, like the Gamelan Council, address larger regions. They have used proven banking techniques like solidarity lending, village banking and mobile banking to overcome barriers to serving poor populations. However, with boards that do not necessarily represent either their capital or their customers, their governance structures can be fragile, and they can become overly dependent on external donors.
; Formal financial institutions
: In addition to commercial banks, these include state banks, agricultural development banks, savings banks, rural banks and non-bank financial institutions. They are regulated and supervised, offer a wider range of financial services, and control a branch network that can extend across the country and internationally. However, they have proved reluctant to adopt social missions, and due to their high costs of operation, often cannot deliver services to poor or remote populations. The increasing use of alternative data in credit scoring, such as trade credit is increasing commercial banks&#x27; interest in microfinance.
;Automated loans
:Automated loans include point-of-sale loans offered by financial technology companies like Affirm, Klarna, Afterpay, and Quadpay. These &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; services are accelerating the automatization of the finance industry. Point-of-sale loans are embedded within retail websites to offer consumers the chance to take out a loan for the price of the product, and pay them back in installments. These &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; lenders either make money by having high late fees or a high interest rate, often higher than the average APR of a credit card. When applying for a loan, these companies data profile by recording the customer&#x27;s history in making payments on time, social media history, income level, education, and previous purchases. Regardless of whether or not the consumer accepts the terms of the loan, these fintech companies have access to this information. Many of them have stated that they sell the information back to the merchant.
:These services are often targeting marginalized groups such as low-income people as 60% of users are 18–34 years old and 40% earn under $40,000. As a result, they are trapping young consumers into a cycle of debt by ease of taking out a loan. This reinforces risky consumer habits and results in 1 out of 6 borrowers defaulting on their payments to these point of sale lenders. Moreover, the companies benefit at the expense of the consumer, so they make it seem harmless while advertising. Yet, it may hurt the consumers&#x27; credit by reporting to a credit bureau, trap them with debt, and give the merchant access to the consumer data profile. This creates a &quot;feedback loop of injustice.&quot;
:Many vulnerable consumers come from low-income backgrounds and do not understand misleading practices, given their lack of digital literacy skills. When investigating these inequalities through activities related to these issues, Gangadharan (2015) finds that &quot;marginal users are exposed and vulnerable to various forms of profiling (e.g. committed by corporate, government, or bad actors) that target unwitting users for both intentionally and unintentionally harmful purposes.&quot; Additionally, filling out the fields on their application without submitting the form can still send the information to the server, thus giving the company access to the information typed. However, many marginalized users come to expect a lack of data privacy given that companies engage in data profiling tactics, calling it &quot;the price of using the internet.&quot; Many feel that these marketplace and society see and target them as &quot;second class citizens&quot;. In addition, a 2015 survey conducted by the Data &amp; Society Research Institute studying technological experiences of 3,000 adults found that &quot;52% of surveyed consumers from the lowest income group said they did not know what information is being collected about them or how it is being used.&quot;

With appropriate regulation and supervision, each of these institutional types can bring leverage to solving the microfinance problem. For example, efforts are being made to link self-help groups to commercial banks, to network member-owned organizations together to achieve economies of scale and scope, and to support efforts by commercial banks to &#x27;down-scale&#x27; by integrating mobile banking and e-payment technologies into their extensive branch networks.

Brigit Helms, in her book &quot;Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems&quot;, distinguishes between four general categories of microfinance providers, and argues for a pro-active strategy of engagement with all of them to help them achieve the goals of the microfinance movement.

==Microcredit and the Web==

Due to the unbalanced emphasis on credit at the expense of microsavings, as well as a desire to link Western investors to the sector, peer-to-peer platforms have developed to expand the availability of microcredit through individual lenders in the developed world. New platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs are emerging on the Web (&quot;peer-to-peer sponsors&quot;), for example MYC4, Kiva, Zidisha, myELEN, Opportunity International and the Microloan Foundation. Another Web-based microlender United Prosperity uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit Zidisha became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.

The volume channeled through Kiva&#x27;s peer-to-peer platform is about $100 million as of November 2009 (Kiva facilitates approximately $5M in loans each month). In comparison, the needs for microcredit are estimated about 250 bn USD as of end 2006.
Most experts agree that these funds must be sourced locally in countries that are originating microcredit, to reduce transaction costs and exchange rate risks.

There have been problems with disclosure on peer-to-peer sites, with some reporting interest rates of borrowers using the flat rate methodology instead of the familiar banking Annual Percentage Rate. The use of flat rates, which has been outlawed among regulated financial institutions in developed countries, can confuse individual lenders into believing their borrower is paying a lower interest rate than, in fact, they are. In the summer of 2017, within the framework of the joint project of the Central Bank of Russia and Yandex, a special check mark (a green circle with a tick and &#x27;State MFO Register&#x27; text box) appeared search results on the Yandex search engine, informing the consumer that the company&#x27;s financial services are offered on the marked website, which has the status of a microfinance organization.

==Social interventions==
There are a few social interventions that have been combined with microfinancing to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS. Such interventions like the &quot;Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity&quot; (IMAGE) which incorporates microfinancing with &quot;The Sisters-for-Life&quot; program a participatory program that educates on different gender roles, gender-based violence, and HIV/AIDS infections to strengthen the communication skills and leadership of women &quot;The Sisters-for-Life&quot; program has two phases; phase one consists of ten one-hour training programs with a facilitator, and phase two consists of identifying a leader amongst the group, training them further, and allowing them to implement an action plan to their respective centres.

Microfinance has also been combined with business education and with other packages of health interventions. A project undertaken in Peru by Innovations for Poverty Action found that those borrowers randomly selected to receive financial training as part of their borrowing group meetings had higher profits, although there was not a reduction in &quot;the proportion who reported having problems in their business&quot;. Pro Mujer, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) with operations in five Latin American countries, combines microfinance and healthcare. This approach shows that microfinance can not only help businesses to prosper; it can also foster human development and social security. Pro Mujer uses a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; approach, which means in one building, the clients find financial services, business training, empowerment advice and healthcare services combined.

According to technology analyst David Garrity, Microfinance and Mobile Financial Services (MFS) have provided marginal populations with access to basic financial services, including savings programs and insurance policies.

==Impact and criticism==
Most criticisms of microfinance have actually been criticisms of microcredit. Criticism focuses on the impact on poverty, the level of interest rates, high profits, overindebtedness and suicides. Other criticism include the role of foreign donors and working conditions in companies affiliated to microfinance institutions, particularly in Bangladesh.

===Impact===

The impact of microcredit is a subject of much controversy. Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers&#x27; children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.

Critics say that microcredit has not increased incomes, but has driven poor households into a debt trap, in some cases even leading to suicide. They add that the money from loans is often used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it fails to empower women, and that it has not improved health or education. Moreover, as the access to micro-loans is widespread, borrowers tend to acquire several loans from different companies, making it nearly impossible to pay the debt back. As a result of such tragic events, microfinance institutions in India have agreed on setting an interest rate ceiling of 15 percent. This is important because microfinance loan recipients have a higher level of security in repaying the loans and a lower level of risk in failing to repay them.

Unintended consequences of microfinance include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to &#x27;loan sharks&#x27; at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.

===Competition and market saturation===
Microcredit has also received criticism for inducing market saturation and fueling problematically competitive, rather than collaborative business communities. The influx of supply generated by the creation of new microcredit-fueled-businesses can be difficult for small economies to absorb. The owners of micro-enterprises within such communities often have limited skill sets and resources available. This can cause a &quot;copycat&quot; phenomenon among small business due to the limited variation in products and services offerings. The high number of individuals selling similar products and services can cause new entrepreneurs to be subject to cutthroat competition over a demand that has not expanded proportionally with the supply.

===Mission drift===

Mission drift refers to the phenomena through which the MFIs or the micro finance institutions increasingly try to cater to customers who are better off than their original customers, primarily the poor families. Roy Mersland and R. Øystein Strøm in their research on mission drift suggest that this selection bias can come not only through an increase in the average loan size, which allows for financially stronger individuals to get the loans, but also through the MFI&#x27;s particular lending methodology, main market of operation, or even the gender bias as further mission drift measures. And as it may follow, this selective funding would lead to lower risks and lower costs for the firm.

However, economists Beatriz Armendáriz and Ariane Szafarz suggests that this phenomenon is not driven by cost minimization alone. She suggests that it happens because of the interplay between the company&#x27;s mission, the cost differential between poor and unbanked wealthier clients and region specific characteristics pertaining the heterogeneity of their clientele. But in either way, this problem of selective funding leads to an ethical tradeoff where on one hand there is an economic reason for the company to restrict its loans to only the individuals who qualify the standards, and on the other hand there is an ethical responsibility to help the poor people get out of poverty through the provision of capital.

===Role of foreign donors===
The role of donors has also been questioned. CGAP recently commented that: &quot;a large proportion of the money they spend is not effective, either because it gets hung up in unsuccessful and often complicated funding mechanisms (for example, a government apex facility), or it goes to partners that are not held accountable for performance. In some cases, poorly conceived programs have slowed the development of inclusive financial systems by distorting markets and displacing domestic commercial initiatives with cheap or free money.&quot;

===Working conditions in enterprises affiliated to MFIs===
There has also been criticism of microlenders for not taking more responsibility for the working conditions of poor households, particularly when borrowers become quasi-wage labourers, selling crafts or agricultural produce through an organization controlled by the MFI. The desire of MFIs to help their borrower diversify and increase their incomes has sparked this type of relationship in several countries, most notably BRAC. Critics maintain that there are few if any rules or standards in these cases governing working hours, holidays, working conditions, safety or child labour, and few inspection regimes to correct abuses. Some of these concerns have been taken up by unions and socially responsible investment advocates.

===Abuse===
In Nigeria cases of fraud have been reported. Dubious banks promised their clients outrageous interest rates. These banks were closed shortly after clients had deposited money and their deposits were lost. The officials of Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) have warned customers about so-called &quot;wonder banks&quot;. One initiative to prevent people from depositing money to wonder banks is the mini-series &quot;e go better&quot; that warns about the practices of these wonder banks.

<doc id="249756" wikidata="Q7152114" url="?curid=249756" title="Paul M. Fleiss">
<text>Paul Murray Fleiss (September 8, 1933 – July 19, 2014) was an American pediatrician and author known for his unconventional medical views. Fleiss was a popular and sought-after pediatrician in the Greater Los Angeles area, both among poor and middle-class patients living near his Los Feliz office and among Southern California celebrities. Fleiss was a breastfeeding and anti-circumcision advocate. He recommended but did not insist upon childhood vaccinations, and stated he could be &quot;convinced either way&quot; as to whether HIV causes AIDS. In 1995, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bank fraud in relation to his daughter Heidi&#x27;s prostitution ring.

==History==
Fleiss initially trained as a pharmacist and osteopath. He relocated from Detroit to California to take advantage of 1962 legislation allowing an osteopath to convert his degree to an MD. He earned his B.S. in pharmacy from Wayne State University, his D.O. from the University of California, Irvine, and his M.P.H. from UCLA.

Fleiss was the father of &quot;Hollywood madam&quot; Heidi Fleiss. In 1995, he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and bank fraud. He helped Heidi launder hundreds of thousands of dollars by lying on her loan application and falsely claiming that she was an employee of his medical practice. He was sentenced to one day in prison, three years&#x27; probation, 625 hours of community service and a $50,000 fine. Following the felony convictions, the Medical Board of California placed him on probation for 1 year and publicly reprimanded him for &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; and &quot;dishonesty&quot;.

Heidi Fleiss was the subject of a 1996 made-for-TV movie entitled &quot;The Good Doctor: The Paul Fleiss Story&quot;, in which Paul Fleiss (played by Michael Gross) was portrayed sympathetically, as the victim of his daughter Heidi&#x27;s machinations. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;the sweeping inaccuracies in &#x27;The Good Doctor: The Paul Fleiss Story&#x27; evidently didn&#x27;t hurt its ratings&quot;, and the film was subsequently retitled &quot;The Making of a Hollywood Madam&quot;, and shown on cable television.

==Personal life==
Fleiss was married to Elissa Ash until their divorce. He had four daughters, Heidi, Amy, Shana, and Kim, and two sons, Jesse and Jason, the latter of whom predeceased his father.

Paul Fleiss died July 19, 2014, aged 80, in Los Angeles, from undisclosed causes.

==Medical views and opinions==
Fleiss was known for his unconventional medical views. He was a proponent of the &quot;family bed&quot;. While he recommended that his patients receive vaccines, he did not insist upon it. He was quoted by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as stating that he &#x27;could be &quot;convinced either way&quot; on whether HIV causes AIDS&#x27;. Fleiss was a breastfeeding advocate and anti-circumcision activist, or intactivist. He was the author or co-author of three books: &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (2001), &quot;Your Premature Baby Comes Home&quot; with Juliette M. Alsobrooks (2006), and &quot;What Your Doctor May Not Tell You about Circumcision&quot; with Frederick M. Hodges (2003).

==Pediatric practice==
Fleiss was described in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;everyone&#x27;s favorite baby doctor&quot; and having been &quot;one of Southern California&#x27;s most sought-after physicians&quot; for thirty years. Sometimes described in the media as a &quot;pediatrician to the stars&quot;, he counted numerous celebrities or their children among his patients.

In 2005, Fleiss was investigated for his role in the death, from untreated AIDS, of Eliza Jane Scovill, the daughter of AIDS denialist Christine Maggiore, who was HIV-positive. Against standard medical practice, Scovill was never tested for HIV, and Fleiss was investigated by the Medical Board of California for gross negligence in her care as well as in the care of a second child who was also HIV-positive.

After receiving over 100 letters of support for Fleiss from patients and parents, the medical board reached a settlement in which Fleiss conceded a failure to maintain adequate medical records and agreed to regular review by an outside physician acting as a monitor.

<doc id="249758" wikidata="Q48221" url="?curid=249758" title="Maliki school">
<text>The Maliki school or Malikism () is one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. It was founded by Malik ibn Anas () in the 8th century. The Maliki school of jurisprudence relies on the Quran and hadiths as primary sources. Unlike other Islamic fiqhs, Maliki fiqh also considers the consensus of the people of Medina to be a valid source of Islamic law.

The Maliki school is one of the largest groups of Sunni Muslims, comparable to the Shafi’i madhhab in adherents, but smaller than the Hanafi madhhab. Sharia based on Maliki Fiqh is predominantly found in North Africa (excluding northern and eastern Egypt), West Africa, Chad, Sudan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the Emirate of Dubai (UAE), and in northeastern parts of Saudi Arabia.

In the medieval era, the Maliki school was also found in parts of Europe under Islamic rule, particularly Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily. A major historical center of Maliki teaching, from the 9th to 11th centuries, was in the Mosque of Uqba of Tunisia.

One who ascribes to the Maliki school is called a Maliki, Malikite or Malikist (, ).

==History==
Although Malik ibn Anas was himself a native of Medina, his school faced fierce competition for followers in the Muslim east, with the Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali, and Zahiri schools all enjoying more success than Malik&#x27;s school. It was eventually the Hanafi school, however, that earned official government favor from the Abbasids.

Imam Malik (who was a teacher of Imam Ash-Shafi‘i, who in turn was a teacher of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal) was a student of Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and 6th Shi&#x27;ite Imam), as with Imam Abu Hanifah. Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni &quot;Fiqh&quot; are connected to Ja&#x27;far, whether directly or indirectly.

The Malikis enjoyed considerably more success in Africa, and for a while in Spain and Sicily. Under the Umayyads and their remnants, the Maliki school was promoted as the official state code of law, and Maliki judges had free rein over religious practices; in return, the Malikis were expected to support and legitimize the government&#x27;s right to power. This dominance in Spanish Andalus from the Umayyads up to the Almoravids continued, with Islamic law in the region dominated by the opinions of Malik and his students. The Sunnah and Hadith, or prophetic tradition in Islam, played lesser roles as Maliki jurists viewed both with suspicion, and few were well versed in either. The Almoravids eventually gave way to the predominantly-Zahiri Almohads, at which point Malikis were tolerated at times but lost official favor. With the Reconquista, the Iberian Peninsula was lost to the Muslims in totality.

Although Al-Andalus was eventually lost, the Maliki has been able to retain its dominance throughout North and West Africa to this day. Additionally, the school has traditionally been the preferred school in the small Arab States of the Persian Gulf (Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar). While the majority of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia follows Hanbali laws, the country&#x27;s Eastern Province has been known as a Maliki stronghold for centuries.

Although initially hostile to some mystical practices, Malikis eventually learned to coexist with Sufi customs as the latter became widespread throughout North and West Africa. Many Muslims now adhere to both Maliki law and a Sufi order.

The Maliki school&#x27;s sources for Sharia are hierarchically prioritized as follows: Quran and then widely transmitted Hadiths (sayings, customs and actions of Muhammad); &quot;`Amal&quot; (customs and practices of the people of Medina), followed by Ahad Hadith, and then followed by consensus of the &quot;Sahabah&quot; (the companions of Muhammad), then individual opinion from the &quot;Sahabah&quot;, Qiyas (analogy), Istislah (interest and welfare of Islam and Muslims), and finally &quot;Urf&quot; (custom of people throughout the Muslim world if it did not contradict the hierarchically higher sources of Sharia).

The Mālikī school primarily derives from the work of Malik ibn Anas, particularly the Muwatta Imam Malik, also known as &quot;Al-Muwatta&quot;. The Muwaṭṭa relies on Sahih Hadiths, includes Malik ibn Anas&#x27; commentary, but it is so complete that it is considered in Maliki school to be a sound hadith in itself. Mālik included the practices of the people of Medina and where the practices are in compliance with or in variance with the hadiths reported. This is because Mālik regarded the practices of Medina (the first three generations) to be a superior proof of the &quot;living&quot; &quot;sunnah&quot; than isolated, although sound, hadiths. Mālik was particularly scrupulous about authenticating his sources when he did appeal to them, as well as his comparatively small collection of aḥādith, known as &quot;al-Muwaṭṭah&quot; (or, The Straight Path). The example of Maliki approach in using the opinion of Sahabah were recorded in Muwatta Imam Malik per ruling of cases regarding the law of consuming Gazelle meat. This tradition were used from opinion of Zubayr ibn al-Awwam. Malik also included the daily practice of az-Zubayr as his source of &quot;living sunnah&quot; (living tradition) for his guideline to pass verdicts for various matters, in accordance of his school of though method.
The second source, the Al-Mudawwana, is the collaborator work of Mālik&#x27;s longtime student, Ibn Qāsim and his mujtahid student, Sahnun. The Mudawwanah consists of the notes of Ibn Qāsim from his sessions of learning with Mālik and answers to legal questions raised by Saḥnūn in which Ibn Qāsim quotes from Mālik, and where no notes existed, his own legal reasoning based upon the principles he learned from Mālik. These two books, i.e. the Muwaṭṭah and Mudawwanah, along with other primary books taken from other prominent students of Mālik, would find their way into the Mukhtaṣar Khalīl, which would form the basis for the later Mālikī madhhab.

The Maliki school is most closely related to the Hanafi school, differing in degree, not in kind. However, unlike the Hanafi school, the Maliki school does not assign as much weight to analogy, but derives its rulings from pragmatism using the principles of &quot;istislah&quot; (public interest) wherever the Quran and Sahih Hadiths do not provide explicit guidance.

===Notable differences from other schools===
The Maliki school differs from the other Sunni schools of law most notably in the sources it uses for derivation of rulings. Like all Sunni schools of Sharia, the Maliki school uses the Qur&#x27;an as primary source, followed by the sayings, customs/traditions and practices of Muhammad, transmitted as hadiths. In the Mālikī school, said tradition includes not only what was recorded in hadiths, but also the legal rulings of the four rightly guided caliphs – especially Umar.

Malik bin Anas himself also accepted binding consensus and analogical reasoning along with the majority of Sunni jurists, though with conditions. Consensus was only accepted as a valid source of law if it was drawn from the first generation of Muslims in general, or the first, second or third generations from Medina, while analogy was only accepted as valid as a last resort when an answer was not found in other sources.

<text>Petronius is a deepwater compliant tower oil platform built from 1997 to 2000 and operated by Chevron in the Gulf of Mexico, 210 km (130.5 mi) southeast of New Orleans, United States.

A compliant piled tower design, it is 640 metres (2,100 ft) high to the tip of flare boom from the mudline (sea floor) and was arguably the tallest free-standing structure in the world, until surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in 2010. This claim is disputed since only 75 metres (246 ft) of the platform are above water and it is unknown if the structure could support itself on land, as it is partially supported by buoyancy. The multi-deck topsides are 64 metres (210 ft) by 43 metres (141 ft) by 18.3 metres (60 ft) high and hold 21 well slots. The compliant tower weighs around 43,000 tons with the topside weighing in at an additional 7,500 tons Around 9,600 m3 (60,000 barrels) of oil and 3,000,000 m3 (100 million cubic feet) of natural gas are extracted daily by the platform.

The platform is situated to exploit the Petronius field, discovered in 1995 in Viosca Knoll (block VK 786) and named after Petronius, the Roman writer. The seabed is 535 m (1,754 ft) below the platform. The compliant tower design is more flexible than conventional land structures to cope better with sea forces. It can deflect (sway) in excess of 2% of height. Most buildings are kept to within 0.5% of height in order to have occupants not feel uneasy during periods of movement.

Construction began in 1997 by J Ray McDermott with the seabed mooring system. The contract for the platform was budgeted at $200 million with total costs of around $500 million. The 4000-tonne North Module was installed in November 1998, but the attempt to install the slightly lighter South Module in December of that year ended with the unit on the seabed. A replacement module was built and installed by Saipem 7000 in May 2000.

<doc id="249762" wikidata="Q3298299" url="?curid=249762" title="Laura Sadler">
<text>Laura Ruth Sadler (25 December 1980 – 19 June 2003) was an English actress. She played pupil Judi Jeffreys in the children&#x27;s school drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, and nurse Sandy Harper in the BBC One hospital drama series &quot;Holby City&quot; for three years from 2000 until her death in 2003.

== Life and career ==
Sadler was born in Ascot, Berkshire, and grew up in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. As a young girl she enrolled at the Jackie Palmer Stage School in High Wycombe, before joining the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London. She was spotted as a future talent at the age of six by Dustin Hoffman, who had seen her in a play and asked to meet her. Before joining the cast of &quot;Holby City&quot;, she had played Judi Jeffreys in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Grange Hill&quot; from 1997 to 1999. Her &quot;Grange Hill&quot; character died after slipping and falling out of a burning building. She also played the part of Skirty Marm in a BBC1 children&#x27;s comedy, &quot;Belfry Witches&quot;. Skirty Marm and her friend Old Noshie (Lucy Davis) were teenage witches banished to Earth from Witch Island, settling in a sleepy village where they caused mischief.

In 1996, she starred in the feature film &quot;Intimate Relations&quot; alongside Julie Walters, where she played a girl with a crush on her mother&#x27;s adulterous lover. She joined the cast of &quot;Holby City&quot;, a spin-off series from the long-running BBC medical drama series &quot;Casualty&quot;, in the show&#x27;s third series, playing the nurse Sandy Harper up until her death.

Eight further &quot;Holby City&quot; episodes featuring Sadler as Sandy had already been filmed, and were aired as scheduled posthumously. BBC scriptwriters consulted Sadler&#x27;s mother, Sonja Sadler, when devising the character&#x27;s exit storyline. Mal Young said: &quot;I went there thinking we were all going to be in tears and it turned into an unofficial storyline conference. I said we would find a way of explaining Laura&#x27;s absence and her mum came up with an idea we all liked.&quot; Sandy&#x27;s farewell episode, &quot;A Friend in Need&quot;, revealed that the character had won £150,000 in the lottery, and left for Australia to follow former love interest Danny Shaughnessy. After discovering various amounts of money she had left behind for her friends at Holby City Hospital, the characters gathered together in the hospital bar at the end of the episode, and raised a toast &quot;To the one and only Sandy!&quot;

== Death ==
In the early hours of 15 June 2003, Sadler fell 40 feet (12 metres) from the balcony of the Holland Park flat of her boyfriend and &quot;Holby City&quot; colleague George Calil. She had consumed a large quantity of alcohol and was later found to have had traces of diazepam and cocaine derivatives in her blood. She suffered severe head injuries and never regained consciousness. Her family decided to take her off life support on 18 June 2003 and she died at Charing Cross Hospital a day later. Her funeral was held at St. Mary&#x27;s and All Saints&#x27; Church in Beaconsfield, and she was cremated at Chilterns Crematorium. Calil was questioned by police, but later released on bail and never charged. Sadler&#x27;s death was ruled as an accident.

Sadler&#x27;s character Sandy Harper continued to appear in pre-recorded episodes of &quot;Holby City&quot; for a while after her death. Her mother aided the show&#x27;s writers in conceiving an exit storyline for the character. In the episode, which was broadcast in September 2003, Sandy was revealed to have won the lottery and subsequently emigrated to Australia.

<doc id="249765" wikidata="Q844536" url="?curid=249765" title="Chandragupta II">
<text>Chandragupta II (r.c. 375-415), also known by his title Vikramaditya, as well as Chandragupta Vikramaditya, was the Gupta emperor. Modern scholars generally identify him with King Chandra of the Delhi iron pillar inscription.

Chandragupta II continued the expansionist policy of his father Samudragupta through military conquests and marital alliances. Historical evidence attests to his remarkable victories, which include the defeat of the Sassanids, the conquest of the Western Kshatrapas and the vassalization of the Hunas. Under the reign of Chandragupta II, the Gupta Empire reached its zenith, directly controlling a vast territory which stretched from the Oxus River in the west to the Bengal region in the east, and from the foothills of the Himalayas in the north to the Narmada River in the south. Chandragupta II expanded his influence and indirectly ruled over the Kuntala region of Karnataka through a marriage alliance with Kadambas, and during his daughter Prabhavatigupta’s 20 years long regency, he effectively integrated the Vakataka kingdom into the Gupta Empire.

Chandragupta II was a devout Vaishnav but tolerated other faiths as well. The Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who visited India during his reign, suggests that he ruled over a peaceful and prosperous kingdom. The legendary figure of Vikramaditya is probably based on Chandragupta II (among other kings), and the noted Sanskrit poet Kalidasa may have been his court poet. The cave shrines at Udayagiri were also built during his rule.

== Names and titles ==
Chandragupta II was the second ruler of the dynasty to bear the name &quot;Chandragupta&quot;, the first being his grandfather Chandragupta I. He was also simply known as &quot;Chandra&quot;, as attested by his coins. The Sanchi inscription of his officer Amrakardava states that he was also known as Deva-raja. The records of his daughter Prabhavatigupta, issued as a Vakataka queen, call him Chandragupta as well as Deva-gupta. Deva-shri (IAST: Devaśri) is another variation of this name. The Delhi iron pillar inscription states that king Chandra was also known as &quot;Dhava&quot;: if this king Chandra is identified with Chandragupta (see below), it appears that &quot;Dhava&quot; was another name for the king. Another possibility is that &quot;dhava&quot; is a mistake for a common noun &quot;bhava&quot;, although this is unlikely, as the rest of the inscription does not contain any errors.

A passage in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; suggests that major parts of the eastern coast of India – Kosala, Odra, Tamralipta, and Puri – were ruled by the Devarakshitas around the same time as the Guptas. Since it seems unlikely that an obscure dynasty named Devarakshita was powerful enough to control substantial territory during the Gupta period, some scholars, such as Dasharatha Sharma, theorize that &quot;Deva-rakshita&quot; (IAST: Devarakṣita) was another name for Chandragupta II. Others, such as D. K. Ganguly, oppose this theory, arguing that this identification is quite arbitrary, and cannot be explained satisfactorily.

Chandragupta assumed the titles &quot;Bhattaraka&quot; and &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;, and bore the epithet &quot;Apratiratha&quot; (&quot;having no equal or antagonist&quot;). The Supiya stone pillar inscription, issued during the reign of his descendant Skandagupta, also calls him &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;. Some other notable titles such as &quot;Lord of the Three Oceans&quot; and &quot;Ascetic King&quot; (&quot;King of the Brahmins&quot;) are also accoladed to Chandragupta II.

== Early life ==

Chandragupta was a son of Samudragupta and queen Dattadevi, as attested by his own inscriptions. According to the official Gupta genealogy, Chandragupta succeeded his father on the Gupta throne. The Sanskrit play &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;, combined with other evidence suggests that he had an elder brother named Ramagupta, who preceded him on the throne. In the play, Ramagupta decides to surrender his queen Dhruvadevi to a Shaka enemy when besieged, but Chandragupta goes to the enemy camp disguised as the queen and kills the enemy. Sometime later, Chandragupta dethrones Ramagupta, and becomes the new king. The historicity of this narrative is debated among modern historians, with some believing it to be based on true historical events, while others dismissing it as a work of fiction.

== Period of reign ==
The Mathura pillar inscription of Chandragupta II (as well as some other Gupta inscriptions) mention two dates: several historians have assumed that one of these dates denotes the king&#x27;s regnal year, while the other date denotes the year of the Gupta calendar era. However, Indologist Harry Falk in 2004 has theorised that the date understood to be the regnal year by the earlier scholars is actually a date of the &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; system. According to Falk, the &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; system is a continuation of the Kushana calendar era established by emperor Kanishka, whose coronation Falk dates to 127 CE. The Kushana era restarts counting after a hundred years (e.g. the year after 100 is 1, not 101).

The date portion of the Mathura inscription reads (in IAST):

: candragupta-sya vijarajya-saṃvatsa[re] ... kālānuvarttamāna-saṃvatsare ekaṣaṣṭhe 60 ... [pra]thame śukla-divase paṃcāmyaṃ

The letters before the words &quot;kālānuvarttamāna-saṃvatsare&quot; are abraded in the inscription, but historian D. R. Bhandarkar (1931–1932) reconstructed them as &quot;gupta&quot;, and translated the term &quot;gupta-kālānuvarttamāna-saṃvatsare&quot; as &quot;year following the Gupta era&quot;. He translated the entire sentence as:

: In the ... year of ... Chandragupta, ... on the fifth of the bright half of the first (Ashadha) of the year 61 following the Gupta era.

Historian D. C. Sircar (1942) restored the missing letters as &quot;[paṃ]cāme&quot; (&quot;fifth&quot;) and concluded that the inscription was dated to the Chandragupta&#x27;s fifth regnal year. The missing letters have alternatively been read as &quot;prathame&quot; (&quot;first&quot;). According to these interpretations, the inscription is thus dated in year 61 of the Gupta era, and either the first or the fifth regnal year of Chandragupta. Assuming that the Gupta era starts around 319–320 CE, the beginning of Chandragupta&#x27;s reign can be dated to either 376–377 CE or 380–381 CE.

Falk agrees that the missing letters denote a numerical year, but dismisses Sircar&#x27;s reading as &quot;mere imagination&quot;, pointing out that the missing letters are &quot;abraded beyond recovery&quot;. In support of his Kushana era theory, Falk presents four Gupta inscriptions (in chronological order) that mention the term &quot;kālānuvarttamāna-saṃvatsare&quot;:

Falk notes that the &quot;dynastic year&quot; in the table above appears to be a year of the Gupta era. The &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; year cannot be regnal year, because Chandragupta I is not known to have ruled for as long as 61 years. If we assume &quot;61&quot; of the Mathura pillar inscription denotes a year of the Gupta era (as assumed by Bhandarkar, Sircar and other scholars), we must assume that &quot;15&quot; of the Buddhist image pedestal also denotes a year of the Gupta era: this is obviously incorrect, since Kumaragupta I ruled after Chandragupta II. Scholars K.K. Thaplyal and R.C. Sharma, who studied the Buddhist image pedestal inscription, speculated that the scribe had mistakenly interchanged the years 121 and 15, but Falk calls this assumption unnecessary.

According to Falk, the discrepancy can be explained satisfactorily, if we assume that the &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; era denotes a system that restarts counting after a hundred years. The Yaksha figure inscription is dated to year 112 of the Gupta era (c. 432 CE), which corresponds to the &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; year 5. Thus, the &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; era used during Kumaragupta&#x27;s time must have started in 432–5 = 427 CE. The years mentioned in the Buddhist image pedestal inscription also suggests that the epoch of this era was c. 426–427 CE. Since the &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; system restarts counting every 100 years, the &quot;kālānuvarttamāna&quot; era used during the reign of Chandragupta II must have started in 327 CE. Thus, the Mathura inscription can be dated to 327+61 = c. 388 CE. While Falk&#x27;s theory does not change the Gupta chronology significantly, it implies that the date of the Mathura inscription cannot be used to determine the beginning of Chandragupta&#x27;s reign.

The Sanchi inscription, dated to 412–413 CE (year 93 of the Gupta era), is the last known dated inscription of Chandragupta. His son Kumaragupta was on the throne by the 415–416 CE (year 96 of the Gupta era), so Chandragupta&#x27;s reign must have ended sometime during 412–415 CE.

== Military career ==

The Udayagiri inscription of Chandragupta&#x27;s foreign minister Virasena suggests that the king had a distinguished military career. It states that he &quot;bought the earth&quot;, paying for it with his prowess, and reduced the other kings to the status of slaves. His empire seems to have extended from the mouth of the Indus and northern Pakistan in the west to the Bengal region in the east, and from the Himalayan terai region in the north to the Narmada River in the south.

Chandragupta&#x27;s father Samudragupta and his son Kumaragupta I are known to have performed the Ashvamedha horse sacrifice to proclaim their military prowess. In the 20th century, the discovery of a stone image of a horse found near Varanasi, and the misreading of its inscription as &quot;Chandramgu&quot; (taken to be &quot;Chandragupta&quot;), led to speculation that Chandragupta also performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice. However, there is no actual evidence to support this theory.

=== Western Kshatrapas ===
Historical and literary evidence suggests that Chandragupta II achieved military successes against the Western Kshatrapas (also known as Shakas), who ruled in west-central India. The Allahabad Pillar inscription of Chandragupta&#x27;s father Samudragupta names the &quot;Shaka-Murundas&quot; among the kings who tried to appease him. It may be possible that Samudragupta reduced the Shakas to a state of subordinate alliance, and Chandragupta completely subjugated them.

Virasena&#x27;s Udayagiri inscription describes him as a resident of Pataliputra, and states that he came to Udayagiri in Central India with the king who sought to &quot;conquer the whole world&quot;. This indicates that Chandragupta had reached Udayagiri in central India during a military campaign. The theory that Chandragupta led an army to Central India is also corroborated by the c. 412–413 CE (Gupta year 93) Sanchi inscription of Amrakardava, who is said to have &quot;acquired victory and fame in many battles and whose livelihood was secured by serving Chandragupta.&quot; A c. 401–402 CE (Gupta year 82) inscription of Chandragupta&#x27;s feudatory &quot;Maharaja&quot; Sanakanika has also been discovered in Central India. The only important power to have ruled in this region during Chandragupta&#x27;s period were the Western Kshatrapas, whose rule is attested by their distinct coinage. The coins issued by the Western Kshatrapa rulers abruptly come to end in the last decade of the 4th century. The coins of this type reappear in the second decade of the 5th century, and are dated in the Gupta era, which suggests that Chandragupta subjugated the Western Kshatrapas.

The exact date of Chandragupta&#x27;s victory is not known, but it can be tentatively dated to sometime between 397 and 409. The last of the 4th century Kshatrapa coins – that of Rudrasimha III – can be dated to the Shaka year 310 or 319 (the coin legend is partially lost), that is 388 or 397. Chandragupta&#x27;s coins, dated to 409, are similar to the Kshtrapa coins, with the Shakas&#x27; Buddhist vihara symbol replaced by the Gupta symbol of Garuda.

Literary evidence also corroborates Chandragupta&#x27;s victory over the Western Kshatrapas. The Sanskrit play &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;, whose historicity is disputed, narrates that Chandragupta&#x27;s elder brother Ramagupta agreed to surrender his queen Dhruvadevi to a Shaka chief when besieged, but Chandragupta went to the enemy camp disguised as the queen, and killed the Shaka chief. Chandragupta bore the title &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;, and several Indian legends talk of king Vikramaditya who defeated the Shakas. Several modern scholars have theorised that these legends may be based on Chandragupta&#x27;s victory over the Shakas.

As a result of his victory over the Western Kshatrapas, Chandragupta must have extended his empire up to the Arabian Sea coast in present-day Gujarat.

=== Other military victories ===

The iron pillar of Delhi contains an inscription of a king called &quot;Chandra&quot;. Modern scholars generally identify this king with Chandragupta II, although this cannot be said with complete certainty.

While alternative identifications have been proposed, there is strong evidence for identifying Chandra of the iron pillar inscription as Chandragupta II:
* Chandragupta&#x27;s coins refer to him as &quot;Chandra&quot;.
* According to the iron pillar inscription, Chandra was a devotee of Vishnu. Chandragupta was also a Vaishnavite, and is described as a &quot;Bhagvata&quot; (devotee of Vishnu) in the Gupta records.
* The iron pillar is said to have been set up by king Chandra in honour of Vishnu, on a hill named Vishnu-pada, but the king seems to have died shortly before the inscription was engraved, as the inscription states that &quot;the king has quit the earth and gone to the other world&quot;. A similar Vishnu-&quot;dhvaja&quot; (flagpole in honour of Vishnu) was set up the Gupta emperor Skandagupta (a grandson of Chandragupta) after the death of his father Kumaragupta I.
* According to his Udayagiri inscription, Chandragupta went on a &quot;digvijaya&quot; (&quot;conquest of all quarters&quot;) campaign. He is known to have been a powerful sovereign emperor, and this fits in well with the iron pillar inscription&#x27;s description of king Chandra as someone who &quot;attained sole supreme sovereignty in the world acquired by his own arm and (enjoyed) for a very long time&quot;.
* The iron pillar inscription states that the southern ocean is &quot;perfumed by the breezes&quot; of Chandra&#x27;s prowess. This may be a reference to Chandragupta&#x27;s extension of the Gupta rule to the Arabian Sea after his conquest of the Western Kshatrapa territory. Arabian Sea was located to the south of the Gupta empire, and thus, the term &quot;southern ocean&quot; is applicable to it in this context.
* The iron pillar inscription states that &quot;his name was Chandra and he was holding the glory of a full moon on his face&quot;. This is reminiscent of his descendant Skandagupta&#x27;s Mandasaur inscription, which describes Chandragupta as &quot;a moon in the galaxy of Gupta kings with the famous name Chandragupta&quot;.

The iron pillar inscription credits Chandra with the following victories:
* Defeated an alliance of enemies in the Vanga country
* Crossed the &quot;seven faces&quot; of the river Sindhu (Indus) during a war and defeated the Vahlikas.

==== Punjab region ====

If Chandra is identified with Chandragupta, it appears that Chandragupta marched through the Punjab region, and advanced up to the country of the Vahlikas, that is, Balkh in present-day Afghanistan. Some short Sanskrit inscriptions at the Sacred Rock of Hunza (in present-day Pakistan), written in Gupta script, mention the name Chandra. A few of these inscriptions also mention the name Harishena, and one particular inscription mentions Chandra with the epithet &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;. Based on the identification of &quot;Chandra&quot; with Chandragupta, and Harishena with the Gupta courtier Harishena, these inscriptions can be considered as further evidence of a Gupta military campaign in the area. However, this identification is not certain, and Chandra of the Hunza inscriptions could have well been a local ruler.

According to Sten Konow, the term &quot;seven faces&quot;, mentioned in the iron pillar inscription, refers to the seven mouths of Indus. Historians R. C. Majumdar and K. P. Jayaswal, on the other hand, believe that the term refers to the tributaries of Indus: the five rivers of Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Sutlej, Beas, and Chenab), plus possibly the Kabul and the Kunar rivers.

It is quite possible that Chandragupta passed through the Punjab region during this campaign: his political influence in this region is attested to by the use of the Gupta era in an inscription found at Shorkot, and by some coins bearing the name &quot;Chandragupta&quot;. However, there is no evidence that Chandragupta annexed Punjab to the Gupta Empire, which suggests that Chandragupta&#x27;s victory in this region was not a decisive one. There is little evidence of Gupta influence in Punjab after his reign: numismatic evidence suggests that Punjab was ruled by petty chieftains after his death. These chieftains bore Indian names, but issued coins that imitate the Kidarite coinage: they may have been Hinduized foreigners or Indians continuing the usage of foreign-style coinage.

==== Bengal region ====
The identification of Chandra with Chandragupta II also suggests Chandragupta achieved victories in the Vanga area in the present-day Bengal region. According to the Allahabad Pillar inscription of his father Samudragupta, the Samatata kingdom of the Bengal region was a Gupta tributary. The Guptas are known to have been ruling Bengal in the early 6th century, although there are no surviving records of the Gupta presence in this region for the intervening period.

It is possible that a large part of the Bengal region was annexed to the Gupta empire by Chandragupta, and that this control continued into the 6th century. The Delhi iron pillar inscription suggests that an alliance of semi-independent chiefs of Bengal unsuccessfully resisted Chandragupta&#x27;s attempts to extend the Gupta influence in this region.

== Personal life and matrimonial alliances ==

Gupta records mention Dhruvadevi as Chandragupta&#x27;s queen, and the mother of his successor Kumaragupta I. The Basarh clay seal mentions Dhruva-svamini as a queen of Chandragupta, and the mother of Govindagupta. It is unlikely that Chandragupta had two different queens with similar names: it appears that Dhruvasvamini was most probably another name for Dhruvadevi, and that Govindagupta was a real brother of Kumaragupta.

Chandragupta also married Kuvera-naga (alias Kuberanaga), whose name indicates that she was a princess of the Naga dynasty, which held considerable power in central India before Samudragupta subjugated them. This matrimonial alliance may have helped Chandragupta consolidate the Gupta empire, and the Nagas may have helped him in his war against the Western Kshatrapas.

Prabhavati-gupta, the daughter of Chandragupta and Kuvera-naga, married the Vakataka king Rudrasena II, who ruled in the Deccan region to the south of the Gupta empire. After her husband&#x27;s death in c. 390, Prabhavati-gupta acted as a regent for her minor sons. In the two copper-plate inscriptions issued during her regency, the names of her Gupta ancestors with their imperial titles appear before the name of the Vakataka king with the lesser title &quot;Maharaja&quot;. This suggests that the Gupta court may have had influence in the Vakataka administration during her regency. Historians Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund believe that the Vakataka kingdom was &quot;practically a part of the Gupta empire&quot; during her 20-year long regency. The Vakatakas may have supported Chandragupta during his conflict with the Western Kshatrapas.

The Guptas also appear to have entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Kadamba dynasty, the southern neighbours of the Vakatakas. The Talagunda pillar inscription suggests that the daughters of the Kadamba king Kakusthavarman, married into other royal families, including that of the Guptas. While Kakusthavarman was a contemporary of Chandragupta&#x27;s son Kumaragupta I, it is noteworthy that some medieval chiefs of present-day Karnataka (where the Kadambas ruled) claimed descent from Chandragupta. According to the Vikramaditya legends, emperor Vikramaditya (a character believed to be based on Chandragupta) sent his court poet Kalidasa as an ambassador to the lord of Kuntala. While the Kuntala king referred to in this legend has been identified by some scholars with a Vakataka king, it is more likely that he was a Kadamba king, because the Vakataka king did not rule over Kuntala, and was never called the lord of Kuntala.

== Administration ==

Several feudatories of Chandragupta are known from historical records:
* &quot;Maharaja&quot; Sanakanika, a feudatory known from the Udayagiri inscription that records his construction of a Vaishnava temple.
* &quot;Maharaja&quot; Trikamala, a feudatory known from a Gaya inscription engraved on a Bodhisattva image
* &quot;Maharaja&quot; Shri Vishvamitra Svami, a feudatory known from a seal found at Vidisha
* &quot;Maharaja&quot; Svamidasa, the ruler of Valkha, was also probably a Gupta feudatory if we assume that his inscription is dated in the Gupta calendar era; according to another theory, his inscription is dated in the Kalachuri calendar era.

The following ministers and officers of Chandragupta are known from various historical records:
* Vira-sena, foreign minister, known from the Udayagiri inscription recording his construction of a Shiva temple
* Amrakardava, a military officer, known from the Sanchi inscription recording his donations to the local Buddhist monastery
* Shikhara-svami, a minister; according to historian K. P. Jayaswal&#x27;s theory, he was the author of the political treatise &quot;Kamandakiya Niti&quot;

== Navaratnas ==
&quot;Jyotirvidabharana&quot; (22.10), a treatise attributed to Kalidasa, states that nine famous scholars known as the Navaratnas (&quot;nine gems&quot;) attended the court of the legendary Vikramaditya. Besides Kalidasa himself, these included Amarasimha, Dhanvantari, Ghatakarapara, Kshapanaka, Shanku, Varahamihira, Vararuchi, and Vetala Bhatta. However, there is no historical evidence to show that these nine scholars were contemporary figures or proteges of the same king. &quot;Jyotirvidabharana&quot; is considered a literary forgery of a date later than Kalidasa by multiple scholars. There is no mention of such &quot;Navaratnas&quot; in earlier literature, and D. C. Sircar calls this tradition &quot;absolutely worthless for historical purposes&quot;.

Nevertheless, multiple scholars believe that one of these Navaratnas – Kalidasa – may have indeed flourished during the reign of Chandragupta II. These scholars include William Jones, A. B. Keith, and Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi among others. It is possible that Kalidasa was a court poet of Chandragupta.

== Religion ==

Many gold and silver coins of Chandragupta, as well the inscriptions issued by him and his successors, describe him as a &quot;parama-bhagvata&quot;, that is, a devotee of the god Vishnu. One of his gold coins, discovered at Bayana, calls him &quot;chakra-vikramah&quot;, literally, &quot;[one who is] powerful [due to his possession of the] discus&quot;, and shows him receiving a discus from Vishnu.

An Udayagiri inscription records the construction of a Vaishnava cave temple by Chandragupta&#x27;s feudatory &quot;Maharaja&quot; Sanakanika, in year 82 of the Gupta era (c. 401–402).

Chandragupta was also tolerant of other faiths. The Udayagiri inscription of Chandragupta&#x27;s foreign minister Virasena records the construction of a temple dedicated to the god Shambhu (Shiva). An inscription found at Sanchi near Udayagiri records donations to the local Buddhist monastery by his military officer Amrakardava, in year 93 of the Gupta era (c. 412–413).

== Faxian&#x27;s visit ==
Chinese pilgrim Faxian visited India during the reign of Chandragupta and spent around six years in the Gupta kingdom. He was mostly interested in Buddhist religious affairs and did not bother to record the name of the reigning king. His account presents an idealised picture of the Gupta administration, and not everything he states can be taken at face value. However, his description of the kingdom as a peaceful and prosperous one seems to be generally true, attested by the fact that he did not face any brigandage unlike the later Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang.

Faxian describes Madhya-desha (&quot;Middle kingdom&quot;), the region to the south-east of Mathura, as a populous region with good climate and happy people. He mentions that the citizens were not required to &quot;register their households or attend to any magistrates and their rules&quot;. Faxian mentions that wicked repeated rebels had their right hand cut off by the king&#x27;s administration, but otherwise, there was no corporal punishment for crimes: the criminals were only fined, lightly or heavily, according to the severity of the crime. According to Faxian, the king&#x27;s bodyguards and attendants all received salaries.

Faxian mentions that other than the untouchable Chandalas, the people did not consume meat, intoxicating drinks, onions or garlic. The Chandalas lived apart from other people and struck a piece of wood to announce their presence when they entered a city or a marketplace: this would enable other people to avoid contact with them. Only the Chandalas engaged in the fisheries and hunting and sold meat. In the general markets, there were no butchers&#x27; shops or alcohol dealers, and the people did not keep pigs or fowl. According to historian R. C. Majumdar, Faxian&#x27;s observations about the people&#x27;s food habits seem to have been based on his contact with the Buddhist religious community and may not be applicable to the general public.

Faxian mentions that the people used cowries for buying and selling goods.

Faxian mentions the Pataliputra region as the most prosperous part of the Middle kingdom, describing its people as benevolent and righteous. He describes an annual Buddhist celebration, which involved a procession of 20 grand carts of Buddhas, the Brahmanas&#x27;s invitation to the Buddhas to enter the city, and music performances. He mentions that in the cities, the Vaishya chiefs had established centres for dispensing charity and medical help to the destitute. These centres attracted the poor, the orphans, the widowers, the childless, the handicapped, and the sick, who were examined by doctors and given food and medicine until they got better.

== Inscriptions ==
The following inscriptions of Chandragupta have been discovered:
* Mathura pillar inscription, dated to the year 61 of the Gupta era. The date has been interpreted as c. 380–381 by earlier scholars, but Harry Falk (2004) dates it to 388 (see Period of reign section above).
* Mathura pillar inscription, undated
* Udayagiri cave inscription, dated to the year 82 of the Gupta era
* Udayagiri cave inscription, undated
* Gadhwa stone inscription, dated to the year 88 of the Gupta era
* Sanchi stone inscription, dated to the year 93 of the Gupta era
* Mehrauli iron pillar inscription, undated

== Coinage ==

Chandragupta continued issuing most of the gold coin types introduced by his father Samudragupta, such as the Sceptre type (rare for Chandragupta II), the Archer type, and the Tiger-Slayer type. However, Chandragupta II also introduced several new types, such as the Horseman type and the Lion-slayer type, both of which were used by his son Kumaragupta I.

Chandragupta&#x27;s various gold coins depict his martial spirit or peacetime pursuits.

; Lion-slayer type
: These coins depict Chandragupta slaying a lion and bear the legend &quot;simha-vikrama&quot;. Similar coins issued by his father Samudragupta depict the king slaying a tiger and bear the legend &quot;vyaghra-parakramaha&quot;. Historian R. C. Majumdar theorises that Chandragupta&#x27;s conquest of present-day Gujarat (where the Asiatic lion is found) may have presented him with an opportunity to hunt lions, resulting in the substitution of tiger with lion on the imperial coins.

; Couch-and-flower type
: These coins depict Chandragupta seated on a couch and holding a flower in his right hand. The legend &quot;rupa-kriti&quot; occurs below the couch. These coins are similar to Samudragupta&#x27;s coins which depict the king playing a musical instrument.

; Rider type
: These coins depict the king riding a fully-caparisoned horse.

In addition, Chandragupta II was the first Gupta king to issue silver coins. These coins were intended to replace the silver coinage of the Western Kshatrapas after Chandragupta II defeated them and were modelled on the Kshatrapa coinage. The main difference was to replace the dynastic symbol of the Kshatrapas (the three-arched hill) by the dynastic symbol of the Guptas (the mythic eagle Garuda). The obverse of these coins depicts a bust of the king, with corrupted Greek legend &quot;OOIHU&quot;. The reverse features the Brahmi script legend &quot;Chandragupta Vikramaditya, King of Kings, and a devotee of Vishnu&quot;, around Garuda, the mythic eagle and dynastic symbol of the Guptas.

== Personality ==

The Udayagiri inscription of Virasena describes Chandragupta as a &quot;king of kings&quot; as well as an ascetic &quot;rajadhirajarshi&quot;, and declares that his activities were &quot;beyond comprehension&quot;.

== Identification with the legendary Vikramaditya ==

Vikramaditya is a legendary emperor of ancient India, who is characterised as the ideal king, known for his generosity, courage, and patronage to scholars. A number of historians believe that at least some of the Vikramaditya legends are based on Chandragupta II. These historians include D. R. Bhandarkar, V. V. Mirashi and D. C. Sircar among others.

Based on some coins and the Supia pillar inscription, it is believed that Chandragupta II adopted the title &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;. The Cambay and Sangli plates of the Rashtrakuta king Govinda IV use the epithet &quot;Sahasanka&quot; for Chandragupta II. The name &quot;Sahasanka&quot; has also been applied to the legendary Vikramaditya.

The legendary Vikramaditya is said to have defeated the Śaka invaders, and was therefore, known as Śakari (&quot;enemy of the Śakas). Chandragupta II conquered Malwa after defeating the Western Kshatrapas (a branch of Śakas); he also expelled the Kushanas from Mathura. His victory over these foreign tribes was probably transposed on upon a fictional character, resulting in the Vikramaditya legends.

According to most legends, Vikramaditya had his capital at Ujjain, although some legends mention him as the king of Pataliputra. The Guptas had their capital at Pataliputra. According to D. C. Sircar, Chandragupta II may have defeated the Shaka invaders of Ujjain, and placed his son Govindagupta as a viceroy there. As a result, Ujjain might have become a second capital of the Gupta empire, and subsequently, legends about him (as Vikramaditya) might have developed. Guttas of Guttavalal, a minor dynasty based in present-day Karnataka, claimed descent from the imperial Guptas. The Caudadanapura inscription of the Guttas alludes to the legendary Vikramaditya ruling from Ujjayni, and several Gutta royals were named &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;. According to Vasundhara Filliozat, their reference to the legendary Vikramaditya is simply because they confused him with Chandragupta II. However, D. C. Sircar sees this as further proof that the legendary Vikramaditya was based on Chandragupta II.

=== Vikram Samvat ===
Vikrama Samvat, an Indian calendar era beginning in 57 BCE, is associated with the legendary Vikramaditya. However, this association did not exist before 9th century. The earlier sources call this era by various names, including &quot;Kṛṭa&quot;, &quot;the era of the Malava tribe&quot;, or simply, &quot;Samvat&quot;. Scholars such as D. C. Sircar and D. R. Bhandarkar believe that the name of the era changed to &quot;Vikram Samvat&quot; after the reign of Chandragupta II, who had adopted the title &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;.

<text>A killifish is any of various oviparous (egg-laying) cyprinodontiform fish, including families Aplocheilidae, Cyprinodontidae, Fundulidae, Nothobranchiidae, Profundulidae, Aphaniidae and Valenciidae. All together, there are 1,270 species of killifish, the biggest family being Rivulidae, containing more than 320 species. As an adaptation to living in ephemeral waters, the eggs of most killifish can survive periods of partial dehydration. Many of the species rely on such a diapause, since the eggs would not survive more than a few weeks if entirely submerged in water. The adults of some species, such as &quot;Kryptolebias marmoratus&quot;, can additionally survive out of the water for several weeks. Most killifish are small, measuring from , with the largest species growing to just under .

The word &quot;killifish&quot; is of uncertain origin, but is likely to have come from the Dutch &quot;kil&quot; for a kill (small stream). Although killifish is sometimes used as an English equivalent to the taxonomical term Cyprinodontidae, this is only one of several families that are referred to as Killifish. Cyprinodontidae more specifically refers to the pupfish family. 

==Range and habitat==

Killifish are found mainly in fresh or brackish waters in the Americas, as far south as Argentina and as far north as southern Ontario and even Newfoundland and Labrador. There are also species in southern Europe, in much of Africa as far south as KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in the Middle East and Asia (as far east as Vietnam), and on several Indian Ocean islands.

The majority of killifish are found in permanent streams, rivers, and lakes, and live between two and three years. Such killifish are common in the Americas (&quot;Cyprinodon&quot;, &quot;Fundulus&quot; and &quot;Rivulus&quot;) as well as in Africa and Asia (including &quot;Aphyosemion&quot;, &quot;Aplocheilus&quot;, &quot;Epiplatys&quot;, &quot;Fundulopanchax&quot; and &quot;Lacustricola&quot;) and southern Europe (&quot;Aphanius&quot;). Some of these habitats can be rather extreme; the only natural habitat of the Devils Hole pupfish (&quot;Cyprinodon diabolis&quot;) is Devils Hole: a cavern at least deep, branching out from a small opening at the surface, approximately by wide.

Some specialized forms live in temporary ponds and flood plains, and typically have a much shorter lifespan. Such species, known as &quot;annuals&quot;, live no longer than nine months, and are used as models for studies on aging. Examples include the African genus &quot;Nothobranchius&quot; and South American genera ranging from the cold water &quot;Austrolebias&quot; of Argentina and Uruguay to the more tropical &quot;Gnatholebias&quot;, &quot;Pterolebias&quot;, &quot;Simpsonichthys&quot; and &quot;Terranatos&quot;.

==Territorial behaviour==

A small number of species will shoal while most are territorial to varying degrees. Populations can be dense and territories can shift quickly, especially for species of the extreme shallows (a few centimetres of water). Many species exist as passive tribes in small streams where dominant males will defend a territory while allowing females and immature males to pass through the area. In the aquarium, territorial behaviour is different for every grouping, and will even vary by individuals. In a large enough aquarium, most species can live in groups as long as there are more than three males.

==Diet==
Killifish feed primarily on aquatic arthropods such as insect (mosquito) larvae, aquatic crustaceans and worms. Some species of &quot;Orestias&quot; from Lake Titicaca are planktonic filter feeders. Others, such as &quot;Cynolebias&quot; and &quot;Megalebias&quot; species and &quot;Nothobranchius ocellatus&quot; are predatory and feed mainly on other fish. The American Flagfish (&quot;Jordanella floridae&quot;) feeds heavily on algae and other plant matter as well as aquatic invertebrates. &quot;Nothobranchius furzeri&quot; needs much food because it grows quickly, so when food supplied is inadequate, bigger fish will eat the smaller fish.

==In lifespan research==
Some strains have a lifespan as short as several months and can thus serve as a model for biogerontological studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.038&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The African turquoise killifish (&quot;Nothobranchius furzeri&quot;) is the shortest-living vertebrate that can be bred in captivity, having a lifespan of between three and nine months. Sexual maturation occurs within 3–4 weeks, with fecundity peaking in 8–10 weeks.

&quot;Nothobranchius furzeri&quot; shows no signs of telomere shortening, reduced telomerase activity, or replicative senescence with age, despite its short lifespan. Nonetheless, lipofuscin accumulates in the brain and liver (associated with age-related neurodegeneration), and there is an increased risk of cancer with age. Calorie restriction reduces these age-related disease conditions. Resveratrol has been shown to increase the mean (56%) and maximum life span (59%) of &quot;Nothobranchius furzeri&quot;, but resveratrol has not been shown to have this effect in mammals.

Transferring the gut microbiota from young killifish into middle-aged killifish significantly extends the lifespans of the middle-aged killifish.

Transgenic strains have been made, and precise genome editing was achieved in &quot;Nothobranchius furzeri&quot; using a draft genome and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. By targeting multiple genes, including telomerase, the killifish can now be used as an attractive vertebrate model organism for aging and diseases (such as &quot;Dyskeratosis congenita&quot;). Sequencing the whole killifish genome indicated modification to the IGF-1 receptor gene.

==As pets==

Many killifish are lavishly coloured and most species are easy to keep and breed in an aquarium. Specimens can be obtained from specialist societies and associations. Striped panchax (also known as the Golden Wonder killifish) are commonly found in pet shops, but caution must be exercised when considering tank mates, since the mouth of the Striped panchax is as wide as the head, and much smaller fish will be eaten. Flagfish, native to south Florida, is another species of killifish commonly found in pet stores. They are useful in aquariums for algae control. The golden topminnow (&quot;Fundulus chrysotus&quot;) is also native to the United States and often available at auction, but care must be taken with these fish to stop them from jumping out of the tank. A firm cover and a layer of floating plants is best when keeping these fish.

==Behaviour-altering infection==
Normally, killifish avoid near-surface water to reduce the danger of being eaten by predators. However, when infected with a type of fluke the fish swim near the surface, and sometimes even swim upside down, exposing their camouflaged bellies. The fluke completes its lifecycle in the digestive tract of birds.

==Evolved resistance to extreme levels of toxicity==
The large populations of killifish and the genetic diversity of the species have enabled it to evolve and survive in areas where other species have died out, including Superfund sites. Over a few dozen generations of killifish in a relatively short period of time (50–60 years), killifish have evolved resistance against levels of dioxins, PCBs, mercury, and other industrial chemicals up to 8,000 times higher than the previously estimated lethal dose. Sequencing the genomes of the adapted individuals showed a common set of mutations among the pollution-tolerant fish, many of which help to deactivate or turn off a molecular pathway responsible for a large part of the cellular damage caused by the chemicals.

Killifish were found to fare relatively well in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

<text>Dollywood is a theme park that is jointly owned by Herschend Family Entertainment and country singer-songwriter Dolly Parton through her entertainment company, Dolly Parton Productions. It is located in the Knoxville metropolitan area in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, near the gateway to The Great Smoky Mountains. Hosting nearly 3 million guests in a typical season from mid-March to the Christmas holidays, Dollywood is the biggest ticketed tourist attraction in Tennessee. It has won many international awards.

In addition to standard amusement park thrill rides, Dollywood features traditional crafts, food, and music of the Smoky Mountain area. The park hosts a number of concerts and musical events each year, including appearances by Dolly Parton and her family as well as other national and local musical acts. 

The theme park is the anchor of Parton&#x27;s Dollywood amusement destination, which also includes the sister water park Dollywood&#x27;s Splash Country, the Dollywood&#x27;s DreamMore Resort and Spa, and the Dolly Parton&#x27;s Stampede Dinner Attraction.

== History ==

=== Rebel Railroad ===
The park opened on June 10, 1961 as a small tourist attraction owned by the Robbins brothers from Blowing Rock, North Carolina. Named &quot;Rebel Railroad&quot;, it included a steam train, general store, blacksmith shop, and saloon. With a theme inspired by the centennial of the Civil War, the train ride let visitors experience &quot;attacks&quot; by Union soldiers, train robbers, and Native Americans. The train and its riders were protected by Confederates who fought off the attacks. The park was modeled after the Robbins brothers&#x27; first successful theme park, Tweetsie Railroad in Blowing Rock.

=== Goldrush Junction ===

For the 1964 season, the park was renamed &quot;Goldrush Junction&quot;. A special announcement was made in the May 24, 1964, edition of &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot;. As part of the name change the park switched to a wild west theme similar to its sister park Tweetsie Railroad.

In 1970, Art Modell – who also owned the Cleveland Browns football team – bought Goldrush Junction. The park retained the railroad and added an outdoor theater and the Robert F. Thomas Chapel.

=== Goldrush ===

For the 1975 season, the park name was changed to &quot;Goldrush&quot;. In April of 1976, Jack and Pete Herschend, owners of Silver Dollar City, bought Goldrush. The park continued to operate as Goldrush for the 1976 season.

=== Silver Dollar City ===

In 1977, the Herschends renamed Goldrush to &quot;Silver Dollar City Tennessee,&quot; making it a sister park to their original Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri. The Herschends spent about $1 million upgrading the park upon purchase and added other improvements over the years. Also in 1977, the train ride added two new steam locomotives, the #70 and the #71, plus the remains of engine #72 for spare parts, from the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route Railroad.

=== Dollywood ===

In 1986, Dolly Parton, who grew up in the area, bought an interest in Silver Dollar City. As part of the deal, the park reopened for the 1986 season as &quot;Dollywood&quot;. In 2010, Parton said she became involved with the operation because she &quot;always thought that if I made it big or got successful at what I had started out to do, that I wanted to come back to my part of the country and do something great, something that would bring a lot of jobs into this area.&quot;

Dollywood has approximately 4,000 people on its payroll, making it the largest employer in the community. From 1986 to 2010, the park doubled in size to . On November 16, 2010, Dollywood earned the industry&#x27;s most prestigious award, the Liseberg Applause Award, which Dolly Parton accepted during a ceremony at IAAPA Attractions Expo 2010 in Orlando.

==== 1980s developments ====
On May 3, 1986, Silver Dollar City Tennessee reopened as Dollywood. The new Rivertown Junction area included Smoky Mountain River Rampage, a whitewater rafting ride; Back Porch Theater; Aunt Granny&#x27;s Dixie Fixins&#x27; Restaurant; and Dolly&#x27;s Tennessee Mountain Home, a replica of the cabin that was Parton&#x27;s childhood home. Also new was &quot;Rags to Riches: The Dolly Parton Story&quot;, a museum displaying articles and mementos from Dolly&#x27;s life and career. &quot;The Butter Churn&quot; (a Trabant ride) was removed at the end of the season. Park attendance doubled to more than a million guests during the first season as Dollywood.

In 1987, the Daydream Ridge area opened and included the Mountain Slidewinder water toboggan ride, Mountain Dan&#x27;s Burger House, Sweet Dreams Candy Shop, The Rainbow Factory blown glass shop, and Critter Creek Playground. Engine #70 was restored to operation. In 1988, the 1,739-seat Celebrity Theater, featuring the &quot;Showcase of Stars&quot; celebrity concert series, was constructed adjacent to the entrance of the park. Five new children&#x27;s rides were added to the Fun Country area, including a Zamperla Balloon Race. The Dollywood Foundation was established to provide books and schools supplies to the children of Sevier County. Thunder Express, a steel mine train coaster, was built adjacent to Blazing Fury in 1989. The ride was relocated to the park from Six Flags Over Mid-America. The 1989 season was the last for the National Mountain Music Festival, which was a carryover from the Silver Dollar City years.

==== 1990s developments ====
In 1990, a 1924 antique Dentzel Carousel, originally built for Rocky Springs Park in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was relocated to the park. Situated near the train depot, it took over the space previously occupied by the Silver Dollar Saloon. The 600-seat Gaslight Theater opened near the carousel. The Smoky Mountain Christmas Festival premiered in November, extending the park&#x27;s operating season into December. Eagle Mountain Sanctuary, an outdoor aviary, was added in 1991 along with the Wings of America Theater, site of the Birds of Prey show, and the 300-seat Valley Theater.

The Showstreet area was added in 1992 and included the Showstreet Palace Theater, The Butterfly Emporium, The Backstage Restaurant, The Spotlight Bakery, Friendship Gardens, and WDLY-FM, a working radio station. To accommodate the expansion, the park&#x27;s main entrance moved from Rivertown Junction to Showstreet. The Barnwood Theater was converted into Imagination Station, an interactive children&#x27;s play area. Dollywood&#x27;s annual attendance topped 2 million for the first time during the 1992 season.

In 1993, the Fun Country area was renovated and became The Country Fair with three new rides: The Wonder Wheel, a tall Ferris wheel; Twist and Shout, a scrambler ride; and Tennessee Twister, a tilt-a-whirl. The Balloon Race ride was relocated to the Daydream Ridge area to make room for the new attractions. Also new at the park was &quot;Sunset Musicfest,&quot; a summer music festival. A year later, in 1994, the Gaslight Theater became the Heartsong Theater, named for the multi-media musical presentation that told the story of Dolly Parton&#x27;s life. In 1995, the Jukebox Junction 1950s &quot;Main Street&quot; themed area was added and included Rockin&#x27; Roadway miniature car ride, The Pines Theater, Red&#x27;s Diner, and Cas Walker&#x27;s Music Store. The Sunset Musicfest did not return for the 1995 season.

The Dollywood Boulevard area was added in 1996 and included Thunder Road, a turbo-simulator ride based on the 1958 movie of the same name. Silver Screen Café, a 1950s cinema-themed restaurant, and Centerstage gift shop were also in the area. In 1997, the &quot;U Pick Nick&quot; children&#x27;s show focused on themes from the Nickelodeon television network and played in Celebrity Theater. The Flooded Mine dark-ride was closed and demolished in October, and Silver Screen Cafe became DJ Platters in the Dollywood Boulevard area. Daredevil Falls, a new shoot the chutes flume ride, opened in the area formerly occupied by the Flooded Mine a year later in 1997. At the time, it was billed as &quot;The Highest and Fastest Waterfall Ride in America&quot; with its drop. Thunder Express was closed in September and sold to Magic Springs Theme Park in Arkansas. The antique carousel was removed at the end of the season and replaced with a new Chance Rides carousel.

In 1999, the Tennessee Tornado, a steel looping coaster, opened in the area formerly occupied by Thunder Express. Also new was the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame, while the Balloon Race ride was removed.

==== 2000s developments ====
The Daydream Ridge area was renovated and became Dreamland Forest, a children&#x27;s mountain-themed interactive play area in 2000. The Festival of Nations international music festival premiered a year later in April 2001. Dolly&#x27;s Splash Country, a new water park opened adjacent to Dollywood&#x27;s parking lot.

Dollywood Boulevard was renovated and became a new area, Adventures in Imagination, in 2002. Smoky Mountain Wilderness Adventure, a new simulator film, replaced Thunder Road, and a new Dolly museum called Chasing Rainbows opened in the building formerly occupied by DJ Platters. In 2003, summer children&#x27;s festival KidsFest premiered, and Imagination Station was converted into Celebration Hall, a special events facility. It was also the final season for the &quot;Showcase of Stars&quot; celebrity concert series.

A new area of the park, Thunderhead Gap, opened with the Thunderhead wooden roller coaster in 2004. The construction of the new area opened up a new valley for park expansion. The Country Fair Falls log flume was demolished in November, and most of the other Country Fair rides, including the Swingamajig, Tennessee Twister, The Convoy, and The Barnstormer, were removed at the end of the season to free up space for newer rides that were added for the 2005 season. The new rides included Dizzy Disk, Amazing Flying Elephants, Lemon Twist, Shooting Star, Sky Rider, VeggieTales Sideshow Spin (children&#x27;s roller coaster), Waltzing Swinger, Piggy Parade, Busy Bees, and Lucky Ducky. The National Southern Gospel &amp; Harvest Celebration was also new in 2005.

In 2006, the Timber Tower ride, along with Lil&#x27; Loggers Landing, Beaver Creek, Beaver Creek Boat Float, and Lumberjack Lifts, opened in a new area adjacent to Thunderhead. The Barbeque &amp; Bluegrass festival also premiered. The 2007 season included the addition of Mystery Mine, a Gerstlauer Eurofighter coaster with two vertical lifts hills and dark ride elements. The ride&#x27;s climax featured fire effects in front of the riders, a 95-degree drop, a heartline roll, and a dive loop. The $17 million ($ in dollars) ride used an abandoned mine shaft theme. In 2008, River Battle, an interactive water raft ride, was built in a new section of the park called Wilderness Pass that connected the Timber Canyon and Craftsman&#x27;s Valley areas. &quot;Thunder Road&quot; returned to the motion theater (Imagination Cinema) and replaced Smoky Mountain Wilderness Adventure. Della&#x27;s Lye Soap shop moved from Craftsman&#x27;s Valley to the Wilderness Pass area. A new exhibit housing the Wings of America show birds moved to its former location. The Polar Express 4-D Experience was shown in Imagination Cinema during the park&#x27;s Smoky Mountain Christmas.

In 2009, Dollywood presented two new shows, &quot;Imaginé&quot; by Le Grand Cirque and &quot;Sha-Kon-O-Hey! Land of Blue Smoke,&quot; which featured music written by Dolly Parton and told the story of the last family living in the Smoky Mountains at the time it became a national park. &quot;Imaginé&quot; headlined the park&#x27;s Festival of Nations. &quot;Thunder Road&quot; was renamed &quot;White Lightning&quot; and then changed to a new attraction, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth: 4-D Adventure&quot;, based on the 2008 film. In 2009, an upcharge zipline attraction called SkyZip (owned by Skyline Eco-Adventures of Maui, Hawaii) opened at Dollywood, becoming the first multi-line zip line tour inside a theme park.

==== 2010s developments ====
The Adventure Mountain attraction opened at a cost of $5 million in the Wilderness Pass area in 2010. It included three distinct adventure courses, Geyser Gorge, Black Bear Cliff, and Rocky Top, that ranged from easy to expert with 100 different rope features, swinging beams, suspension bridges, flying islands, and floating stairs. Adventure trails ranged from a few inches above the ground to more than in the air. The area also included a scaled-down play area called Camp Teachittoomee for younger children. Also for the 2010 season, Dollywood brought back &quot;Sha-Kon-O-Hey! Land of Blue Smoke&quot; and changed its logo for the 25th anniversary.

In 2011, a new area called Owens Farm with a $5.5 million giant swing called Barnstormer replaced Dreamland Forest. The barnyard-themed area included a play area for younger guests. Christmas on Ice, a new ice skating Christmas show, premiered in DP&#x27;s Celebrity Theater and headlined Smoky Mountain Christmas. Wild Eagle opened March 24, 2012, and was the first Bolliger &amp; Mabillard Wing Coaster in the United States. It was also the biggest investment in Dollywood history. In 2012, the operator of SkyZip sued Dollywood, blaming the park for damaging the zip line network during its construction of Wild Eagle, but Dollywood blamed the damage on storms. Settling out of court, Dollywood took over SkyZip operations from Skyline Eco-Adventures, and closed the attraction in 2019. Timber Tower was dismantled before opening in 2012 due to a lawsuit with the ride manufacturer. Also in 2012, Dollywood dropped the VeggieTales name from Sideshow Spin, removing any mentions of the franchise from the ride altogether. In December of the very same year, the park announced that Adventure Mountain would be closed permanently following the 2012 season.

Dollywood dedicated 2013 to encouraging families to spend time together. New shows for the season included Cirque Shanghai, Mystic India, and One World Party as part of Festival of Nations along with more than 50 new international food items. The park also introduced &quot;Great American Summer,&quot; a new summer festival that replaced KidsFest. It included the Great American Country Show, Gazillion Bubbles, The Little Engine Playhouse, and Salute to America. Dollywood extended its hours and added a nightly fireworks show. Smoky Mountain Christmas added a new show that was Dolly Parton&#x27;s version of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Dollywood&#x27;s slogan for the year was &quot;Make Time for Happy!&quot; Imagination Cinema became Dreamsong Theater and played Dolly&#x27;s &quot;My People&quot;, a show about Dolly&#x27;s family.

In 2014, FireChaser Express, a dual-launch family coaster, replaced Adventure Mountain in the Wilderness Pass area of the park. Dollywood&#x27;s slogan was changed to &quot;Love Every Moment,&quot; and Smoky Mountain Christmas added a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer meet-and-greet called Holly Jolly Junction. Dollywood&#x27;s DreamMore Resort and Spa opened adjacent to Dollywood&#x27;s Splash Country in 2015. For the 30th anniversary of the park, the park redesigned the entrance for resort guests and added two new shows to Festival of Nations called &quot;Rhythm of the Dance&quot; and &quot;Timber&quot;. Cas Walker&#x27;s was demolished to make room for a new attraction, and six new shows were added to &quot;Great American Summer&quot; along with the revival of the Showcase of Stars concert series. Also new was Rock the Smokies, a Christian music festival, and Rudolph and friends returned to the Smoky Mountain Christmas festival.

In 2010, Parton said that she would like to open more Dollywood parks in the future. &quot;We definitely want to expand with new things every year, eventually with a resort,&quot; she said. &quot;We may eventually have Dollywoods in other parts of the country, where we can kind of be true to whatever&#x27;s going on in that part of the world.&quot; On August 21, 2013, Parton announced Dollywood&#x27;s DreamMore Resort and Spa, which opened on July 27, 2015.

Lightning Rod, a Rocky Mountain Construction wooden coaster, opened on June 13, 2016. It opened as the world&#x27;s first launched wooden coaster as well as the fastest wooden coaster in the world. A year later, in 2017, a freefall ride called Drop Line, which replaced Timber Tower, opened along with a junior roller coaster called Whistle Punk Chaser. Two new seasonal events debuted, and Dollywood&#x27;s Splash Country added the TailSpin Racer mat racer slide complex. Sideshow Spin and River Battle were removed.

In 2018, the former River Battle site was transformed into the Plaza at Wilderness Pass, a new open space with covered seating for relaxing and enjoying seasonal events. With the debut of the Spring Mix three-week music series, the 2018 &quot;Season of Showstoppers&quot; also marked the park&#x27;s largest investment in entertainment in Dollywood&#x27;s history. The 2018 Festival of Nations includes three headliners that are new to Dollywood: Flamenco Kings starring Los Vivancos (Pines Theater), National Dance Company of Siberia (Celebrity Theater), and Ladysmith Black Mambazo (Showstreet Palace Theater). The first Summer Celebration event includes various performances and attractions, including DRUMLine Live! in Celebrity Theater, a show that focuses on the musical styles of marching bands from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. It uses technology, including video screens and special effects, to enhance soul, R&amp;B, country, and other types of music. Renovations included upgrades to Aunt Granny&#x27;s and re-branding and renaming of two shops.

Work began in October 2017 on &quot;Wildwood Grove&quot;, adding eleven new experiences to the park. Attractions include a suspended family coaster (Dragonflier), a restaurant (Till &amp; Harvest), an indoor play area (Hidden Hollow), an outdoor splash pad (Wildwood Creek), a swinging boat ride (The Great Tree Swing), and a 50 ft tall tree with a canopy covered in butterflies (The Wildwood Tree). The $37 million 5-acre development, described as &quot;a land built from Dolly Parton&#x27;s dreams&quot;, opened May 10, 2019. It was part of a $300 million 6-year expansion project.

==== 2020s developments ====

In October 2019, it was announced that the park would add its first new festival in 14 years. Dollywood&#x27;s Flower &amp; Food Festival will feature 10 to 15 feet tall topiaries based on Dolly&#x27;s songs like &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;, photo opportunities, a rainbow sky over Showstreet, and food. The festival was to have commemorated the park&#x27;s 35th season and run from May 8 to June 14, 2020, but was deferred to May 7 to June 13, 2021.

Dollywood filed plans in October 2019 for a new resort adjacent to Splash Country and DreamMore Resort. It is planned to feature a 310-room hotel, a 325-seat restaurant, and a conference space. The plans indicate the resort will create 100 jobs. In June 2021, Dollywood announced plans for a $500 million expansion of the complex, including more details about the planned hotel complex announced in 2019. The new resort, with the name revealed to be the HeartSong Lodge &amp; Resort, will have 302 rooms, five floors of suites, a four-story atrium with a large central fireplace, and multiple shopping and culinary experiences. HeartSong Lodge is scheduled to open in 2023, along with campgrounds, three additional resorts, and a &quot;record-breaking&quot; attraction for the theme park.

During the 2022 off-season, a few changes were made to better the park and provide more space and improve efficiency. The Silver Dollar Mine tunnel, connecting the lower section of Craftsman’s Valley and The Village, was removed. The area now provides a more open space for guests to walk through and also allow a chance to relax and enjoy the views of the passing Dollywood Express. Also, the parking complex was renovated to better utilize the lots at both Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country to provide a more efficient experience for guests as they enter the property. The principal change being the swapping of the guest traffic lanes with the tram lanes, which removes previous points of intersection between the two. The multi-property parking complex now employs a one-way circuit which eliminates the two-way traffic pattern of the old parking lot layout. Also, the addition of two extra parking toll booths (four attendants), as well as more staging lanes for the toll booths, will result in a reduction of time spent waiting to enter the property. Other projects throughout the Dollywood theme park property include the renovation of Iron Horse Pizza (formerly known as Victoria’s Pizza) to include greater production capacity and more seating space for guests. The Emporium also received a complete makeover, providing a modern shopping experience as guests look to find unique Dollywood keepsakes. Also, as guests have continued to ask for more room to provide spacing in the park, two buildings were removed to allow for wider walkways — the former Eagle Shop (part of the second phase of the Craftsman’s Valley widening project) and the former Christmas Cottage in Rivertown Junction.

On August 5, 2022, it was announced that a new roller coaster named Big Bear Mountain was under construction and opened on May 12, 2023. It is also the longest in the park&#x27;s history.

<doc id="249778" wikidata="Q421111" url="?curid=249778" title="Acrosome">
<text>The acrosome is an organelle that develops over the anterior (front) half of the head in the spermatozoa (sperm cells) of humans and many other animals. It is a cap-like structure derived from the Golgi apparatus. In placental mammals, the acrosome contains degradative enzymes (including hyaluronidase and acrosin). These enzymes break down the outer membrane of the ovum, called the zona pellucida, allowing the haploid nucleus in the sperm cell to join with the haploid nucleus in the ovum.
This shedding of the acrosome, known as the acrosome reaction, can be stimulated &quot;in vitro&quot; by substances that a sperm cell may encounter naturally, such as progesterone or follicular fluid, as well as the more commonly used calcium ionophore A23187. This can be done to serve as a positive control when assessing the acrosome reaction of a sperm sample by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. This is usually done after staining with a fluoresceinated lectin such as FITC-PNA, FITC-PSA, FITC-ConA, or fluoresceinated antibody such as FITC-CD46.

In the case of globozoospermia (sperm with round heads), the Golgi apparatus is not transformed into the &quot;acrosome&quot;, causing male infertility.

<doc id="249779" wikidata="Q741400" url="?curid=249779" title="Camberley">
<text>Camberley is a town in northwest Surrey, England, around south-west of central London. It is in the Borough of Surrey Heath and is close to the county boundaries with Hampshire and Berkshire. Known originally as &quot;Cambridge Town&quot;, it was assigned its current name by the General Post Office in 1877.

Until the start of the 19th century, the area was a sparsely populated area of infertile land known as Bagshot or Frimley Heath. Following the construction of the Royal Military College at Sandhurst in 1812, a small settlement grew up to the south and became known as Yorktown (also spelled York Town). A second British Army institute, the Staff College, opened to the east in 1862, and the nucleus of Cambridge Town was laid out at around the same time. The two settlements grew together over the following decades and are now contiguous. Much of the town centre dates from the late 20th and early 21st centuries, including The Atrium, a retail, entertainment and residential complex, opened in 2008.

Transport links through the area began to improve with the opening of the London-Basingstoke turnpike in 1728, now the A30 London Road. The Basingstoke Canal, which runs to the south of Camberley, was completed in 1794 and the wharf at Frimley was used to supply building materials for the Royal Military College. Blackwater station, on the Reading to Guildford line, opened to the west of Yorktown in 1849 and Camberley station, on the Ascot to Aldershot line, followed in 1878. In the second half of the 20th century, improvements to the road network in the area included the construction of the M3 motorway and the Blackwater Valley relief road.

The area has a strong links to the performing arts - Camberley Theatre was opened in 1966 and Elmhurst Ballet School was based in the town until 2004. Among the former residents are the Victorian composer, Arthur Sullivan, who attended Yorktown School as a child, the musician Rick Wakeman, who lived in Camberley during the 1980s, and the actress, Simone Ashley, who was born in the town in 1995. There are several works of public art in Camberley, including &quot;The Concrete Elephant&quot;, which was installed in 1964 on the London Road, having been commissioned for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show of the previous year. &quot;Into Our First World&quot;, a sculpture by Ken Ford, is on display outside the borough council offices on Knoll Road.

==Toponymy==
Camberley was assigned its current name on 15 January 1877 by the General Post Office. Previously, the settlement had been known as &quot;Cambridge Town&quot; and the change was made to prevent letters and parcels being misdirected to Cambridge in the East of England. The new name is a portmanteau of &quot;Cam&quot; (the name of a local stream), &quot;Amber Hill&quot; (an area of high ground identified in a survey of 1607 by the cartographer, John Norden) and &quot;ley&quot; (a suffix found in local toponyms, such as Frimley and Yateley, derived from the Old English &quot;lee&quot; meaning &quot;shelter&quot; or &quot;lea&quot; meaning &quot;pasture&quot; or &quot;meadow&quot;).

As Cambridge Town, the settlement was originally named for Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, who laid the foundation stone of the Staff College in December 1859. Similarly, Yorktown (sometimes spelled York Town), to the west of Camberley, was named for Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, who authorised the construction of the Royal Military College in December 1802. The dukes were commanders-in-chief of the British Army at the times when the two colleges were founded. The inns, the Duke of York and The Cambridge Hotel, were among the first buildings to be constructed in Yorktown and Camberley respectively.

Several of the street names in Camberley and Yorktown are named for early local landowners, including Teckels Avenue (after John Teckel, builder of Teckels Castle), Stanhope Road (after the family of Griselda Stanhope, Teckel’s wife) and Sparvell Walk (after David Sparvell, a town alderman). Watchetts Drive takes its name from a former manor field (Watchetts is derived from &quot;woad scaet&quot;, meaning land where woad grows). Osnaburgh Parade is named after Osnaburgh, an estate in Fife held by Prince Frederick.

==Geography==
Camberley is in the far west of Surrey, adjacent to the boundaries of Hampshire&#x27;s Hart district and Berkshire&#x27;s Bracknell Forest district. It lies directly between the A30 national route and M3 motorway (junction 4 exit). It is at the northern edge of the Blackwater Valley conurbation, north of Farnborough, south of Bracknell and east of Basingstoke.

The town of Blackwater, to the west is identified by the Government Statistical Service (including its ONS office) as within the Camberley Built-up-Area but is in the Hart District of Hampshire and has its own town council (both take in Hawley).

Camberley primarily lies on the Bagshot Beds, deposited in the Eocene. This sandy layer contains seams of clay and areas of pebble gravel.

==History==
Before the 19th century, the area now occupied by Camberley was referred to as Bagshot or Frimley Heath. An Iron Age fort, among many examples known as Caesar&#x27;s Camp, was to the north of this area alongside the Roman road The Devil&#x27;s Highway. The &quot;Intenarium Curiosum&quot;, published in 1724, describes a collection of Roman pottery around the area, and a further collection was discovered at Frimley Green in the late 20th century. In the Middle Ages, the area was part of Windsor Forest.

In the 17th century, the area along the turnpike road through Bagshot Heath (now the A30) was known as a haunt of highwaymen, such as William Davies – also known as the Golden Farmer – and Claude Duval. The land remained largely undeveloped and uncultivated due to a sandy topsoil making it unsuitable for farming. In &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the whole island of Great Britain&quot;, written between 1724 and 1726, Daniel Defoe described the area as barren and sterile; &quot;a mark of the just resentment shew&#x27;d by Heaven upon the Englishmen&#x27;s pride… horrid and frightful to look on, not only good for little, but good for nothing&quot;. A brick tower was built on top of The Knoll in the 1770s, by John Norris of Blackwater. It may have been used for communications but there is no firm evidence. The remains are now known as The Obelisk.

===19th century===
The town as it now stands has its roots in the building of The Royal Military College, which later became the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in 1812. A settlement known as &quot;New Town&quot; grew in the area around the college which in 1831 was renamed Yorktown, after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. At this time, the population was 702. In 1848, the first parish church of St. Michael, Yorktown was built by Henry Woodyer, in an area formerly part of Frimley, itself only a chapelry of Ash. Later, the Staff College was established to the east of the academy, and a property speculator built the nearby Cambridge Hotel.

During the 19th century, Camberley grew in size. This was given added impetus with the arrival of the branch-line railway and railway station in 1878 and a reputation for healthy air, due to the vast number of pine trees, which were said to be good for those suffering from pulmonary disorders. By the end of the century the population had reached 8,400. Since then, the town has absorbed the original settlement of Yorktown, which is now regarded as part of Camberley.

===20th century===
The Southern Scott Scramble, the first known motorcycle scrambling event, took place on Camberley Heath on 29 March 1924. The event, won by A.B. Sparks, attracted a crowd in the thousands and is considered to be the first instance of what later developed in the sport of motocross. During the Second World War, the Old Dean common was used as an instruction camp of the Free French Forces. The Kremer prize was conceived in the Cambridge Hotel in Camberley in 1959 after Henry Kremer toured a Microcell factory.

The defunct Barossa Golf Club, on Barossa Common, was founded in 1893 and continued until the Second World War.

The Old Dean housing estate was built in the 1950s on the &quot;Old Dean Common&quot; for residents of heavily bombed Surrey-area&#x27;s homeless after the Second World War. Many of the roads on that half of the Old Dean are named after areas of London, with the others named after places on the common.

In 1969 there was an outbreak of rabies when a dog, just released from a six month quarantine after returning from Germany, attacked two people on Camberley Common. The scare resulted in restriction orders for dogs and large-scale shoots to carry out the destruction of foxes and other wildlife.

===21st century===
After debate and delay (plans having been discussed for over half a decade), in 2006, a mixed-use development west of Park Street named The Atrium was built of residential, leisure and retail buildings with wide pedestrianised areas and 683 public parking spaces. Its 217 mid-rise apartments split into courtyards in the Barcelona style. Fourteen new retail units face directly onto Park Street, opposite the Main Square shopping centre. Park Street has been pedestrianised and landscaped as part of the development. Leisure facilities include a nine-screen cinema, a bowling alley, a health and fitness club, cafés and restaurants. Various elements of The Atrium was opened during 2008, with the final elements, the main cinema and bowling alley, opening in October and November 2008, respectively.

In 2009, the town&#x27;s households were named by Experian as having the highest carbon footprint in the UK, estimated at 28.05 tonnes per household per year (compared to 18.36 tonnes for the lowest, South Shields).

==Local and national government==
Camberley is in the parliamentary constituency of Surrey Heath and was represented at Westminster from May 2005 to July 2024 by Conservative Michael Gove. After stepping down in the 2024 election Gove was replaced by Al Pinkerton of the Liberal Democrats

Surrey County Council, headquartered in Reigate, is elected every four years. Camberley is represented by three councillors - one for each of the &quot;Camberley East&quot;, &quot;Camberley West&quot; and &quot;Heatherside and Parkside&quot; divisions.

Elections to Surrey Heath take place every four years. Three councillors represent &quot;Heatherside&quot; ward and two councillors are elected to each of the &quot;Old Dean&quot;, &quot;Parkside&quot;, &quot;St Michael&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;St Paul&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Town&quot; and &quot;Watchetts&quot; wards. The Brough of Surrey Heath is twinned with Sucy-en-Brie, France and with Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%. The remaining households not accounted for above were temporary/caravans and shared households.

The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining percentage is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible percentage of households living rent-free).

==Economy==
Camberley&#x27;s town centre is host to &quot;The Square&quot; shopping centre (previously called The Mall), controversially purchased by Surrey Heath Borough Council for £110 million in 2016. This is a late 1980s development anchored by rent free stores such as Sports Direct subsidiary House of Fraser. The High Street has a number of shops as well as bars and clubs, many of the latter being more recent additions. There are a number of secondary shopping streets including Park Street, Princess Way and parts of London Road, including the &quot;Atrium&quot; development. Camberley&#x27;s town centre is suffering a decline in footfall and increases in vacancies as shoppers in affluent areas move their spending online and towards leisure and experience activities as opposed to traditional retail.

Major employers include Siemens, which moved its UK headquarters to the area in 2007. Burlington Group who moved into Watchmoor Park in 2009 and Sun Microsystems, until they were taken over by Oracle in 2010, whose UK headquarters was located just across the Hampshire border in Minley next to the M3 motorway at junction 4a. Krispy Kreme UK are based in Albany Park, an industrial estate just outside Camberley in nearby Frimley.

==Public services==
===Utilities===

The York Town and Blackwater Gas Company was formed in 1859 and opened its gasworks at Yorktown in November 1862. Street lighting in Camberley was initially provided by oil lamps, but gas lamps were installed from 1900. In around 1903, the works began to supply the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. In 1904, a short branch line was laid from the South Eastern Railway south of Blackwater station, enabling the coal required to be supplied by train. The works came under the control of the Southern Gas Board in 1949 and closed in 1969.

The electricity supply to the area was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1909. Unlike most towns in Surrey, Camberley did not have its own power station and instead, electricity was purchased on the wholesale market and was distributed locally. The gas and electricity companies merged in 1927.

The Frimley and Farnborough District Water Company was formed in 1893 and began to supply Camberley four years later. Water was extracted from the chalk aquifer and was piped to a filtration plant at Frimley Green, before being pumped to a service reservoir on Frith Hill. In 1893, the Basingstoke Canal company agreed that the water company could abstract up to per day from the canal, at a cost of 1 penny per . In 2023, the drinking water supply for Camberley is provided by South East Water. 

Initially, wastewater from Camberley was disposed of in cesspits or discharged to local streams. In the mid-1880s a drainage system was installed, leading to a sewage farm at Yorktown. Following a report in 1902, which condemned the state of the town sewers, new pipework was installed and a new wastewater treatment works opened in Yorktown in 1907. In 2023, Camberley Sewage Treatment Works is operated by Thames Water.

The postal service to Yorktown began in 1844 and the first postmaster was appointed in 1890. The telephone service to Camberley commenced in April 1897.

===Emergency services and healthcare===
The first police station was opened in 1892 on the corner of Portesbury Road and the High Street. In 1910, the local force had a total of eight officers. In 1971, the station moved to the east, but remained on Portesbury Road. The 1971 station closed in 2011. The building was demolished in 2016 for the construction of new houses and flats. In 2023, the nearest police station to Camberley is at Aldershot, operated by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary. The nearest counter service run by Surrey Police is at the Woking Borough Council offices.
Camberley Fire Brigade was founded in May 1889 and was initially equipped with a hand-operated Merryweather pump. In 1900, the brigade moved to The Avenue and relocated to the current station in London Road in 1967. In 2023, the local fire authority is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service.

An ambulance service is recorded in Camberley in 1898. Initially it operated with a horse-drawn vehicle, but the service was equipped with a motorised ambulance during the 1920s. Patients were charged a fee for using the service, which was affiliated to the St John Ambulance and the British Red Cross. In 2023, the nearest ambulance station to Camberley is at Farnborough.

In 2023, the nearest hospital is Frimley Park Hospital around from Camberley. There are three GP surgeries in the town, on Upper Gordon, Park and Frimley Roads.

==Transport==
Camberley railway station is immediately south of the town centre and is managed by South Western Railway, which operates all services. Trains run to via (extended to and from London Waterloo during peak periods) and to via (a few trains continue to ). A 2017 infrastructure assessment commissioned by the borough council notes that rail journey times to London from Camberley are slow ( minutes) and that many local residents choose to drive to , and for faster, direct services. Blackwater railway station is immediately to the west of Yorktown and is managed by Great Western Railway, which operates all services. Trains run to via and to via Guildford.
Camberley is linked by bus to local destinations in west Surrey, northeast Hampshire and southeast Berkshire. Companies operating routes through the town include: Thames Valley Buses to Bracknell; Arriva Guildford &amp; West Surrey to Guildford via Woking; Stagecoach South to Aldershot and Farnborough; and White Bus to Ascot and Staines.

The M3 runs to the south of Camberley and is accessed via junction 4 at the southwestern corner of the town. The stretch of the motorway through the Borough of Surrey Heath was upgraded to a smart motorway in 2017. The other major roads in the town are the A30, which runs roughly parallel to the motorway between Hounslow and Basingstoke, and the A331 Blackwater Valley relief road. Yorktown and east Camberley are linked to Frimley by the B3411 and A325 respectively. Old Dean is linked to Deepcut via the B3015.

A £1.2M shared cycle and footpath between Blackwater station and Watchmoor was completed in 2017 and a new bike-parking facility opened in Princess Way in the town centre in 2021. In the same year, Surrey County Council consulted on a scheme to improve local cycling infrastructure, focused on a route between Camberley and Frimley.

==Education==
===Early schools===
The first school to open in the Camberley area, a National school, was established in 1818. Originally housed in a cottage close to the Royal Military College, one of its early pupils was the composer, Arthur Sullivan. In 1871, it moved to a site adjacent to the St Michael&#x27;s Church vicarage. By 1872, there was a second school in Yorktown, which may have been a school for nonconformists, although its origins are uncertain.

The first Cordwalles School was founded in Elliot Place, Greenwich, in 1805 and one of its early pupils was the future prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli. In 1875, it moved to Cordwalls Farm, Maidenhead, from which it acquired its name. The school merged with Kingswood School, Camberley, which had been established on part of the former Collinwood Estate in 1910. In 1939, the school was evacuated to Market Drayton, but did not return to Camberley at the end of the war. The site was used by Ballard School in the 1950s.

Barossa Secondary School began teaching its first pupils in September 1963, although the official opening ceremony did not take place for another two years. The secondary modern school, on the Old Dean estate, was constructed on a site adjacent to the former Ballard School.

Frimley and Camberley Grammar School opened in 1931 on Frimley Road. The school moved to the former Ballard School, adjacent to the then new Barossa Secondary School in 1967. The original site was then used as an annex for France until 1971. The buildings have since been used for Watchetts School, now South Camberley Primary and Nursery School.

===Current schools===
Kings International College was opened as France Hill Secondary School in 1947. For the first eleven years, it was based at Franz Hill House, which had been built . The school moved to its current location on Watchetts Drive in 1959 and adopted its present name in 2001.

Collingwood College was formed in 1971 from the merger of Camberley Grammar School, Barossa Secondary School and Bagshot Secondary School. It became a self-governing Technology College in September 1994 and gained Foundation status in September 1999.

The current Cordwalles School was founded in 1962 and was officially opened on 5 March 1963. Initially a primary and infants school, it became a middle school in 1971, before reverting to a junior school again in 1994.

===Relocated schools===
The Royal Albert Orphan Asylum was founded in Camberley in 1864 and the first 100 children were admitted in December of that year. Originally a mixed institution, girls were not admitted after 1903. It was renamed the Royal Albert School in 1942 and its management was merged with that of the Royal Alexandra School in 1948. The following year, an Act of Parliament was passed to formally amalgamate the two institutions, creating The Royal Alexandra and Albert School. Pupils from both schools were transferred in stages from their original sites to new accommodation at Gatton Park between 1848 and 1954. The former school buildings in Camberley were damaged by fire in 1987 and were demolished in 1994. The grounds were split in two by the construction of the M3.

Elmhurst Ballet School was founded as the Mortimer School of Dancing in 1923. It adopted its current name in 1947, taken from Elmhurst House in Camberley, where it was based. During the Second World War, Sadlers Wells and Rambert Schools were evacuated to Elmhurst and the pupils of all three schools performed to entertain soldiers billeted locally and to raise money for the war effort. After the end of the war, pupil numbers began to expand (from 60 in 1933 to 240 in 1947) and a purpose-built theatre was constructed, opening in May 1960. Much of the rest of the school was rebuilt during the 1970s and the new buildings were opened by Princess Margaret in 1979. The school relocated to Birmingham in 2004, with the aim of providing professional dance training outside of the southeast of England. The former school site in Camberley was redeveloped as Elmhurst Court.

==Places of worship==
===Anglican churches===

St Michael&#x27;s Church was designed by the architect, Henry Woodyer, and is constructed in local Frimley stone. The foundation stone was laid in September 1848 and the church was consecrated in May 1851. The church was built as a nave only, but Woodyer&#x27;s design incorporated masonry arches in the walls, which could be knocked through when the building was expanded. The chancel was added in 1858 by George Gilbert Scott and aisles were built to a design by Charles Buckeridge in 1864-65. The tower, in Bargate stone, was added in 1891, and is topped by a broach spire, which reaches a height of above ground level.

St Paul&#x27;s Church was designed by W. D. Caröe in 1902 and elements of the building are influenced by Swedish architectural trends of the period. The chancel is topped by a wood-shingled spire. One of the stained-glass windows is dedicated to Doveton Sturdee, a local resident who died in 1925. St Mary&#x27;s Church, designed by E. E. Lofting, was consecrated in 1937 and was built as a daughter church to St Paul&#x27;s. The building has a small tower and is constructed of brick and concrete with a stucco finish.

St Martin&#x27;s Church, dedicated to Martin of Tours, was consecrated in 1978. The construction was paid for in part with money raised from the sale of the site of the former St George&#x27;s Church, which had closed in 1966. Proceeds from the sale of copies of the John Betjeman poem, &quot;A Subaltern&#x27;s love song&quot;, which mentions Camberley, were also used to fund the building work. The congregation of Heatherside Parish Church began meeting in January 1977. Heatherside became an ecclesiastical parish in September 2000.

===Other places of worship===
St Tarcisius Church was built in 1923-26 as a memorial to Catholic military officers, who had died in the First World War. It was designed by Frederick Walters and is constructed of Bargate stone with Bath stone dressings. Several of the stained-glass windows were designed by Paul Woodroffe.
High Cross Church opened in Knoll Road in March 1990. It replaced the Congregational Church, which was demolished in 1990 to make way for the College Gardens shopping complex, and the Methodist Church, demolished in October of the same year.

The local Bengali Welfare Association established an Islamic centre in the former St Gregory&#x27;s Roman Catholic School building in 1996. In 2010, a planning application to demolish the school and replace it with a purpose-built mosque was rejected by the borough council. The plans were rejected again the following year, following a public inquiry.
==Culture==

Camberley Theatre, in Knoll Road, opened as the Camberley Civic Hall on 1 October 1966. It closed in May 1995 for a £1.3M refurbishment and reopened as Camberley ArtsLink in November of the same year. In December 2001, the venue was again rebranded, adopting its current name. A second refurbishment, involving the rebuilding of the frontage, was completed in December 2021.

There are several works of public art in Camberley. &quot;The Concrete Elephant&quot;, adjacent to the London Road in Yorktown, was installed at the yard of Trollope &amp; Colls in 1964. It had been commissioned for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show the previous year and the artist, Barbara Jones, designed the sculpture using pipework from the company&#x27;s product range. The current tenants of the site, HSS Hire, are required to maintain the artwork as part of their lease.
Into Our First World, by Ken Ford, was unveiled outside the borough council offices in March 1993. The sculpture, cast in silicon bronze, depicts a figure reclining beneath a tree. It explores the relationship between humanity and the natural world, and its form echoes the sweet chestnut tree growing behind it. The Right Way, by Rick Kirby was unveiled outside the Atrium in January 2009. It depicts three metal figures pointing in different directions along Park Street and Obelisk Way.

==Sport==
===Venues===
The London Road Recreation Ground opened in 1898 and was extended in 1931. During the early 19th century, the area had been used as a plant nursery until its purchase by the UDC in the 1890s. Watchetts Recreation Ground was part of the Watchetts House estate until 1927, when it was bought by the UDC. The ground was officially opened on 16 May 1931.
Until the 1990s, Crabtree Park was a rubbish dump. The landfill site was closed, the waste was capped and the area reopened as a recreation ground. The skate park was reopened in 2014, following a £25,000 refurbishment project.

Until the mid-1930s, Camberley residents used the Blackwater River to swim. The first purpose-built pool, the Blue Pool, was built on the London Road by a private company and opened in May 1934. The borough council took over the facility in 1973, but it closed three years later when essential repair works were found to be financially unviable. The Manor House flats were built on the site of the Blue Pool in the early 1980s.
The Arena Leisure Centre was built on the northeastern corner of the London Road Recreation Ground and opened in November 1984. The facility closed in August 2019 and was demolished. The new Arena Leisure Centre, on the same site as the previous centre, opened in July 2021. It has two swimming pools, a gym and three exercise studios. The centre is owned by the borough council and is operated by Places Leisure on a 25-year design, build, operate and maintain contract.

===Organisations===

Camberley Town Football Club joined the Surrey Football Association in January 1896 and is thought to have been founded the previous year. It began as part of the St Michael’s Club, the social club associated with St Michael’s Church. The team was initially referred to as St Michael’s, Camberley and played its home games on meadow land in King’s Ride. The first recorded match took place in October 1896, against a team from the Royal Military College. By late 1900, the club was under financial pressure and was refounded as Camberley and Yorktown F. C. in January 1897. After two decades of moving between temporary home grounds, the club was established at Krooner Park in 1922.

The first cycling club to be founded in the area is recorded in a local directory of 1889. By 1904, the Camberley Wheelers had been formed and was organising meetings at the London Road Recreation Ground. In 1969, the club merged with Farnborough Cycling Club to form the Farnborough &amp; Camberley Cycling Club.
Camberley Rugby Football Club was founded in 1931 and played its first game at Watchetts Recreation Ground in October of that year. The club affiliated to the Surrey Rugby Football Union in 1933 and, like most other local teams, disbanded in September 1939. During the Second World War, the recreation ground was used to grow potatoes and it was not until the autumn of 1947 that club was able to resume. Initially Camberley R.F.C. had use of the cricket pavilion as tenants of the cricket club, but constructed their own clubhouse in 1970. In March 1973, the first team won the Surrey Cup.

Camberley Heath Golf Club was designed by Harry Colt and was formally opened by Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein on 1 January 1914. A project to regenerate the course, reinstating some of the original bunker designs, was undertaken in the mid-2010s. In 2020, the course was used as a location for third series of the BBC television drama, &quot;Killing Eve&quot;.

By the mid-1860s, there were two cricket teams in the area, one for Yorktown and one for Cambridge Town, and a match is recorded between the two in June 1865. They had merged by 1882, when the name &quot;Camberley Cricket Club&quot; was adopted. The club shut down at the start of the First World War, but was refounded in 1929 and began playing its home games at the Watchetts Recreation Ground the following year. Local cricket again ceased at the start of the Second World War, but a new club was founded in 1944 and the first match was played the following year. A new ground was leased from the Watchetts estate and the first home games were played there in 1951. The ground was officially opened in 1952 and was bought by the club the following year. Over the next three decades, the club sold off part of the land surrounding the ground to fund improvements to the pitch and pavilion. The first girls&#x27; team was launched in 2013.
The first hockey club in Camberley was formed in 1898 and, by 1907, there were two clubs in the town. The present Camberley and Farnborough Hockey Club was founded in the 1950s and plays its home games at Kings International College. There are two tennis clubs in the area: Camberley Lawn Tennis Club is based at Southcote Park, which has five all-weather courts; Frimley Tennis Club is based at Watchetts Recreation Ground and has four outdoor courts.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
The Camberley Obelisk is a square brick tower in the grounds of St Tarcissius School. Local legend states that it was built by John Norris , although Historic England gives a construction date of . Originally the tower is thought to have been tall, but only the lower third remains standing. It may have been built as a folly or as a signalling tower.
The Staff College, to the north of Camberley town centre, is part of the Joint Services Command and Staff College, which provides training and education for established officers in the British Armed Forces and civil servants in the Ministry of Defence. The institution has its origins in the Royal Military College, High Wycombe, which was founded in 1799. It moved to Farnham in 1813, relocating seven years later to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. The Staff College building was designed by James Pennethorne and constructed in 1862. It was primarily built using London stock bricks, although the front elevation is partially faced with stone. The uppermost storey was added in 1913.

Camberley War Memorial was erected in 1922 at the southern entrance to the Royal Military Academy. It takes the form of a Latin cross, carved from granite. The names of 233 people who died in the First World War are recorded on two columns at the base of the cross and 140 who died in the Second World War are listed on four piers at the corners of the plinth. A stone, set into the pavement at the foot of the memorial, commemorates Victoria Cross recipient Garth Walford, who was born in Yorktown in 1882 and who died at Gallipoli in 1915.

<text>Schwarzwald-Baar () is a (district) in the south of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Ortenaukreis, Rottweil, Tuttlingen, Constance, the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen, and the districts Waldshut, Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald and Emmendingen.

==History==
The district was created in 1973, when the districts of Donaueschingen and Villingen were merged.

==Geography==
The district got its name from the two predominant landscapes in the district. The Black Forest (&quot;Schwarzwald&quot;), and the &quot;Baar&quot;, the foothills between the Black Forest and the Swabian Jura (&quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot;). Both the Danube River and the Neckar River have their origins in the Schwarzwald and Baar district.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms is modeled after the two coat of arms of the cities of Villingen and Schwenningen. Villingen had a horizontally divided blue-and-white arms, while Schwenningen had a vertically divided blue-and-white arms. Combining both divisions gives the four fields. The eagle in the top-left quarter is taken from the coat of arms of the city of Villingen, and derives from the Zähringen family who ruled that city in the 13th century. When the cities of Villingen and Schwenningen merged to form Villingen-Schwenningen in 1972, a similar method was used to derive a new city coat of arms.

<text>Zemun (, ; ) is a municipality in the city of Belgrade, Serbia. Zemun was a separate town that was absorbed into Belgrade in 1934. It lies on the right bank of the Danube river, upstream from downtown Belgrade. The development of New Belgrade in the late 20th century expanded the continuous urban area of Belgrade and merged it with Zemun.

The town was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary in the 12th century and in the 15th century it was given as a personal possession to the Serbian despot Đurađ Branković. After the Serbian Despotate fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1459, Zemun became an important military outpost. Its strategic location near the confluence of the Sava and the Danube placed it in the center of the continued border wars between the Habsburg and the Ottoman empires. The Treaty of Passarowitz of 1718 finally placed the town into Habsburg possession, the Military Frontier was organized in the region in 1746, and the town of Zemun was granted the rights of a military commune in 1749. In 1777, Zemun had 6,800 residents, half of which were ethnic Serbs, while another half of the population was composed of Germans, Hungarians and Jews. With the abolishment of the Military Frontier in 1881, Zemun and the rest of the eastern Srem was included into Syrmia County of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, part of Austria-Hungary. Following Austro-Hungarian defeat in World War I, Zemun returned to Serbian control on November 5, 1918 and became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia).

According to the 2022 census results, the municipality of Zemun has a population of 177,908 inhabitants. Apart from the Zemun proper, the municipality includes suburbs of Batajnica, Ugrinovci, Zemun Polje and Nova Galenika to the northwest.

== Name ==
In ancient times, the Celtic and Roman settlement was known as &quot;Taurunum&quot;. The Frankish chroniclers of the Crusades mentioned it as &quot;Mallevila&quot;, a toponym from the 9th century. This was also a period when the Slavic name &quot;Zemln&quot; was recorded for the first time. Believed to be derived from the word &quot;zemlja&quot;, meaning &quot;soil&quot;, it was a basis for all other future names of the city: modern Serbian (Cyrillic) or &quot;Zemun&quot; (Latin), &quot;Za·munt&quot; (Romanian), Hungarian &quot;Zimony&quot; and German &quot;Semlin&quot;, which is mentioned in the Austrian-German folksong &quot;Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter&quot; as the place where the army of Prince Eugene of Savoy set up camp before the Siege of Belgrade (1717) that liberated the city from the Ottoman Empire.

== History ==


The area of Zemun has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. Baden culture graves and ceramics like bowls and anthropomorphic urns were found in the town. Bosut culture graves were found in nearby Asfaltna Baza. The first Celtic settlements in Taurunum area originate from the 3rd century BC when the Scordisci occupied several Thracian and Dacian areas of the Danube. The Scordisci founded both Taurunum and Singidunum across the Sava, predecessor of modern Belgrade. The Romans came in the 1st century BC, Taurunum became part of the Roman province of Pannonia around 15 AD. It had a fortress and served as a harbour for the Pannonian (Roman) fleet of Singidunum (Belgrade). The pen of Roman poet Publius Ovidius Naso (Ovid) was said to be found in Taurunum. After the Great Migrations the area was under the authority of various peoples and states, including the Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of the Gepids and the Bulgarian Empire. The town was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary in the 12th century and in the 15th century it was given as a personal possession to the Serbian despot Đurađ Branković. After the nearby Serbian Despotate fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1459, Zemun became an important military outpost. In 1521, the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary, 500 šajkaši (river flotilla troops) led by Croatian Marko Skoblić, and Serbs fought against the invading Ottoman army of Suleyman the Magnificent. Despite hard resistance, Zemun fell on July 12 and Belgrade soon afterwards. In 1541, Zemun was integrated into the Syrmia sanjak of the Budin pashaluk.

Zemun and the southeastern Syrmia were conquered by the Austrian Habsburgs in 1717, after the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Peterwardein (5 August 1716) and through the Treaty of Požarevac (German: Passarowitz) became a property of the Schönborn family. In 1736, Zemun was the site of a peasant revolt. Its strategic location near the confluence of the Sava and the Danube placed it in the center of the continued border wars between the Habsburg and the Ottoman empires. The Treaty of Belgrade of 1739 finally fixed the border, the Military Frontier was organized in the region in 1746, and the town of Zemun was granted the rights of a military commune in 1749. In 1754, the population of Zemun included 1,900 Eastern Orthodox Christians, 600 Catholics, 76 Jews, and about 100 Romani. In 1777, the population of Zemun numbered 1,130 houses with 6,800 residents, half of which were ethnic Serbs, while another half of population was composed of Catholics, Jews, Armenians and Muslims. Among Catholic population, the largest ethnic group were Germans. From this period originates the increased settlement of Germans and Hungarians in the Zemun.

While during the Ottoman period Zemun was a typical oriental-type small town, with khans, mosques and large number of Turkish population, after becoming part of Austria, the town prospered as an important road intersection and a border city, which boosted trade. The town had a port on the Danube and was a major fishing center. It is recorded that in 1793, a heavy Beluga sturgeon was caught. In 1816 it was greatly expanded by mass resettlement of Germans and Serbs in the new town suburbs of Franzenstal and Gornja Varoš, respectively. In the 19th century, Zemun reached 7,089 residents and 1,310 houses. Zemun also became important in Serbian history as the refuge for Karađorđe in 1813 as well as many other people from the nearby Belgrade and the rest of Karađorđe&#x27;s Serbia which fell to the Ottoman rule.

During the Revolution of 1848–1849, Zemun was one of the de facto capitals of Serbian Vojvodina, a Serbian autonomous region within Habsburg Empire, but in 1849, it was returned under the administration of the Military Frontier. With the abolishment of the Military Frontier in 1881, Zemun and the rest of the eastern Srem was included into Syrmia County of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, part of Austria-Hungary. The first railway line that connected it to the west was built in 1883, and the first railway bridge over the Sava followed shortly thereafter in 1884.

The Zemun Fortress was the site of the first shots fired during World War I, when the Austro-Hungarian Army shelled the Serbian capital of Belgrade. Serbian engineers responded by demolishing the Old Railway Bridge over the Sava River, damaging an Austro-Hungarian Navy patrol boat below. During the Serbian campaign at the beginning of World War I, Zemun was briefly occupied by the Royal Serbian Army, and many South Slavs living in the city fled to Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian Balkan Army under Oskar Potiorek quickly retook the city and hanged suspected collaborators. The city returned to Serbian control on November 5, 1918. The town became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The inter-war period was marked by political struggle between the city gentry (organized into the Radical Party, Democratic Party and the Croatian Peasant Party) and the more socialist parties supported by the ethnic Germans.

In 1934 two intra-city bus lines were introduced connecting Zemun with the parts of Belgrade, and the general shift of attention towards this issue was supported by the growing Serbian population of Zemun.

The Zemun airbases originally built in 1927 were an important geostrategic objective in the Axis invasion of April 1941. Following the surrender of Yugoslavia that same month, Zemun, along with the rest of Syrmia, was given to the Independent State of Croatia. The city was taken from Axis control in 1944, and since then, it is part of Serbian region known as Central Serbia. The city is now home of the Air force command building, a monumental edifice, situated at 12 Аvijatičarski Square in Zemun, Belgrade.

== Geography ==
The Municipality has an area of . It is located in the eastern Syrmia region, in the central-western section of the Belgrade City area. The urban section of Zemun is both the most northern and the most western section of urban Belgrade. Zemun borders the province of Vojvodina to the west (municipality of Stara Pazova and municipality of Pećinci), and municipalities of Surčin to the south, Novi Beograd to the south-east and Palilula and Stari Grad across the Danube.

The core of the city are the neighborhoods of Donji Grad, Gardoš, Ćukovac and Gornji Grad. To the south, Zemun continues into Novi Beograd with which it makes one continuous urban area (neighborhood of Tošin Bunar). In the west it extends into the neighborhoods of Altina and Plavi Horizonti and to the north-west into Galenika, Zemun Polje and further into Batajnica.

Zemun originally developed on three hills, Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija, on the right bank of the Danube, where the widening of the Danube begins and the Great War Island is formed at the mouth of the Sava river. Actually, these hills are not natural features. Zemun loess plateau is the former southern shelf of the ancient, now dried, Pannonian Sea. Modern area of Zemun&#x27;s Donji Grad was regularly flooded by the Danube and the water would carve canals through the loess. Citizens would then build pathways along those canals and so created the passages, carving the hills out of the plateau. After massive 1876 floods, local authorities began the construction of the stony levee along the Danube&#x27;s bank. Levee, a kilometer long, was finished in 1889. Today it appears that Zemun is built on several hills, with passages between them turned into modern streets, but the hills are actually manmade.

The Danube bank in the north is mostly marshy, so the settlements are built further from the river (Batajnica) separated from it by hillocks (up to ). The city of Zemun itself was built right on the bank, above sea level. These are points of the Zemun loess plateau, an extension of the Syrmia loess plateau, which continues into the crescent-shaped Bežanijska Kosa loess hill on the south-east. The yellow loess is thick up to 40 meters and very fertile, with rich, grass-improved, humus chernozem. The uninhabited river islands of Great War Island and Little War Island on the Danube, also belong to the municipality Zemun, too.

Loess cliff &quot;Zemun&quot; was protected by the city on 29 November 2013. It consists of the very steep right bank of the Danube and is a typical example of the dry land loess. There are four distinguished loess horizons and four horizons of the fossil earth. The horizons developed during the warmer intervals of the glacials. Loess cliff is estimated to be 500,000 years old. The vertical cliff is high, it is exposed and barren, and the protected area covers . It was described for the first time in 1920 by Vladimir Laskarev. Another exposed section of the same loess ridge, Kapela ridge in Batajnica, has also been protected as a separate natural monument. Kapela is older though, originating from some 800,000 years ago.

In September 2018, Belgrade&#x27;s mayor Zoran Radojičić announced that the construction of a dam on the Danube, in the Zemun-New Belgrade area, will start soon. The dam should protect the city during the high water levels. Such project was never mentioned before, nor it was clear how and where it will be constructed, or if it&#x27;s feasible at all. Radojičić clarified after a while that he was referring to the temporary, mobile flood wall. The wall will be high and long, stretching from the Branko&#x27;s Bridge across the Sava and the neighborhood of Ušće in New Belgrade, to the &quot;Radecki&quot; restaurant on the Danube&#x27;s bank in the Zemun&#x27;s Gardoš neighborhood. In case of emergency, the panels will be placed on the existing construction. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019 and to finish in 2020.

=== Lagums ===
One of the characteristics of the Zemun&#x27;s topography are the &quot;lagums&quot;, artificial underground corridors which crisscross below the loess area of Gardoš, Muhar, Ćukovac and Kalvarija. This terrain is one of the most active landslide areas in Belgrade. Being cut into for centuries, the loess in some sections have cliffs vertical up to 90%. The Romans began digging the lagums at least as early as 1,700 years ago, using them mostly as the food storages, but later were also used for supply and eventual hiding and evacuation. In the previous centuries, settlers left many vertical shafts which ventilated the lagums, drying the loess and keeping it compact.

The loess is useful for this: it is strong, durable, and easy to be dug through. However, it turns into sand when mixed with water. The average temperature in the lagums is 

Though used by the local population as food storages, during the Ottoman period, the Turkish administration did not commonly use them. After the Austrians acquired Zemun, they used the underground to store ammunition. In this period, the myths of the entire grid of underground corridors connecting Zemun and Belgrade under the Sava river originated. However, historians dispute this as, though the Austrians held Zemun permanently from 1717, they held Belgrade only from 1717 to 1739, which was not enough for such a major engineering enterprise, given the technology of the period. On 31 July 1938, a section of the Zemun&#x27;s Roman Catholic cemetery collapsed and fell through into the lagum on which it was built, one of the largest in Zemun. As of this time people tended to label any old structures as &quot;Roman&quot;, believing that the Romans had built them, they referred to the corridors as the &quot;Roman&quot; ones.

After World War II, as the city rapidly urbanized, the new settlers were unaware of the lagums, especially the largest one, which covered an area of on Ćukovac. As there was no sufficient sewage system at that time, they built septic tanks and collected rainwater, but also as the ventilation shafts in time were covered or filled with garbage, it all made the ground wet in the course of several decades. The lagums retained the moist and began to collapse. Eventually, the walls and houses became unstable to the point of breaking façades and walls. In 1988 city authorities finally intervened as the houses began to sink in three streets. Holes were drilled to connect the surface with the largest lagum. Altogether, 22 drillings were made and of concrete were poured into the lagum, filling it until the ground was stabilized, but the lagum was destroyed in the process. Still, the situation is critical after almost every downpour. On 29 September 2011, while constructing the supporting wall which was to prevent landslide in the section of Kalvarija, the construction workers triggered one which killed four of them. A long lagum, which was explored by 2001, is located right below the place where the tragedy happened. So far, 76 long corridors have been discovered, with many smaller ones. The longest of them is long and the total explored length is . They cover an area of . Many have collapsed during time, as they are not being kept since the 1980s.

Still, it is believed that the majority of them haven&#x27;t been discovered or explored. The walls of those which have, are being covered with bricks or woods. Some corridors are dead ends while others are connected. The &quot;Galeb&quot; rowing club uses one of the lagums on the bank of the Danube to store their kayaks.

There are numerous stories about the Zemun&#x27;s lagums, their distribution and expansion of the grid. The tales of lagums connecting Zemun with the bank of the Danube, neighboring Bežanija, the Roman well in the Belgrade Fortress and the other parts of Belgrade across the Sava, became a commonplace in Zemun&#x27;s and Belgrade&#x27;s urban mythology. Older myths even included various monsters dwelling below. Still, there is a historically confirmed story of the house of Živojin Vukojčić, Interbellum industrialist. His son, Dragi Vukojčić, built the underground rooms in 1943 as a shelter, but the local myths claimed that he had an entire factory below. Still, when the agents from the Communist security agency OZNA came to arrest him after the war, Vukojčić asked to let him change his clothes. He fled down the lagum to the Danube, and then via boat and a plane, escaped to Brazil. Latest stories include criminals from the Zemun Clan, who were allegedly hiding in the lagums during the police Operation Sabre, after they assassinated prime minister Zoran Đinđić on 12 March 2003. In the 21st century, the stories of mythical creatures are replaced with those of criminals, smugglers, drug addicts and homeless people.

The lagums remained an important part of the local Zemun identity, preserving the spirit of the town and personal memories. For generations of the local boys, descending into the lagums, wandered through them and stayed below as long as possible, which was of a coming of age ritual. Even the name, Zemun, comes from the words &quot;zemlja&quot; (earth) or &quot;zemunica&quot; (dug out).

== Neighbourhoods and suburbs ==
The municipality has only two official settlements: Belgrade (Zemun), which is part of the urban Belgrade city proper (&quot;uža teritorija grada&quot;; statistically classified as &quot;Belgrade-part&quot;) and the village of Ugrinovci (which includes the hamlets of Grmovac and Busije). Many of the neighbourhoods developed in the last few decades (Altina, Plavi Horizonti, Kamendin, Grmovac, Busije, etc.).

There are four local communities in the municipality: Batajnica, Ugrinovci, Zemun Polje and Nova Galenika. They were formed in 2009 after the old ones were abolished in 1996.

== Demographics ==


As Zemun grew into one of the most populous neighborhoods of Belgrade, population of the municipality had a steady growth since World War II. According to the 2022 census, the urban population of Zemun was 166,049, while the municipality had 177,908 inhabitants.

=== Ethnic groups ===
The ethnic structure of the municipality, according to 2022 census:
== Administration ==

The municipality of Zemun became part of the Belgrade City Area (&quot;Teritorija grada Beograda&quot;) with the division of Yugoslavia into banovinas by king Alexander I on October 3, 1929. On April 1, 1934, the municipality itself was absorbed into the municipality of Belgrade, so the post of the president of the municipality of Zemun was abolished and &quot;Zemun section administrator&quot; was appointed to the Belgrade&#x27;s city government.

Between 1941 and 1944 it was occupied by the German army as part of the East Syrmia Occupation Zone (&quot;Okupationsgebiet Ostsyrmien&quot;). Germany technically recognised Zemun and surroundings as part of the Independent State of Croatia puppet regime, but Zemun remained under direct German rule. During this time the Sajmište concentration camp was established, where over 20000 Jews, Romani and opponents of the Nazi regime died.

After 1945 Zemun was administratively divided into the City of Zemun and Zemun district (srez), unlike rest of Belgrade which was divided into raions. In 1955 both City of Zemun and most of the Zemun district were incorporated into Belgrade again. In the 1950s and 1960s, municipalities of Boljevci and Dobanovci were annexed to the municipality of Surčin while Batajnica was annexed to Zemun itself. In 1965 Surčin was annexed to the municipality of Zemun which marked the largest territorial expansion of Zemun (438 km2). However, on November 24, 2003, Belgrade City assembly voted to re-create the municipality of Surčin, but it remained under the administration of Zemun until November 3, 2004, when separate municipal government was established after the local elections. A motion for Batajnica to split from Zemun too was active for a while in the early 2000s (see List of former and proposed municipalities of Belgrade).

== Economy ==
Zemun is one of the most developed municipalities of Belgrade, with developed industries in almost every branch. Zemun has two large and still growing industrial zones, one located along the highway and the other one along the road to Batajnica and further to Novi Sad (Galenika, Goveđi Brod, etc.). Industries include: heavy agricultural machines and appliances (&quot;Zmaj&quot;), precise and optical instruments and automatized appliances (&quot;Teleoptik&quot;), clocks (&quot;INSA&quot;), busses and other heavy vehicles (&quot;Ikarbus&quot;), pharmaceuticals (&quot;Galenika&quot;), plastics (&quot;Grmeč&quot;), shoes (&quot;Obuća Beograd&quot;), textile (&quot;TIZ&quot;, &quot;Zekstra&quot;), food, candies and chocolate (&quot;Soko Štark&quot;), metals (&quot;IMPA&quot;, &quot;Intersilver&quot;), wood and furniture (&quot;Gaj&quot;, &quot;Reprek&quot;), recycling (&quot;INOS metali&quot; and &quot;INOS papir&quot;), beverages (&quot;Coca-Cola&quot;, &quot;Navip&quot;), chemicals (&quot;Roma&quot;), building materials (&quot;DIA&quot;), electronics, leather, etc. In addition to this dozens of halls, and warehouses are built throughout both industrial zones.

The following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):
== Transportation ==
=== Road ===
Several important roads of Serbia run through the municipality. The Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the old (&quot;Batajnički drum&quot;) and new (highway) road Belgrade-Novi Sad, the still in construction starting point (Batajnica-Dobanovci) of the future Belgrade beltway (Batajnica-Bubanj Potok), Belgrade-Novi Sad railway, etc. Until 2014, Zemun had no bridges, apart from the seasonal pontoon bridge which connects the mainland with the Great War Island during summer. The first bridge over the Danube, Pupin Bridge which connected Zemun to Borča, was completed in 2014.

In March 2016, mayor of Belgrade Siniša Mali announced the massive reconstruction of the Old Sava Bridge. However, in May 2017, after the project papers were publicized, it was obvious that the city actually wanted to demolish the bridge completely and build a new one. Citizens protested while the experts rejected the reasons named by the authorities, adding that it is a mere money throwing on the unnecessary project. Mali said that the old bridge will not be demolished but moved, and that citizens will decide where, but he gave an idea to move it to Zemun, as the permanent pedestrian bridge to the Great War Island. In an article &quot;Cloud over the Great War Island&quot;, Aleksandar Milenković, member of the Academy of Architecture of Serbia, opposed the motion. He expressed fear that having in mind the &quot;synchronous ad hoc decisions of the administration&quot;, the reaction should be prompt as the seemingly benign idea is actually a strategically disastrous enterprise (concerning the protected wildlife on the island). He also suspects that the administration in this case, just as in all previous ones, will neglect the numerous theoretical and empirical guidelines.

=== River ===
In 2014 the government set the locality of the former port as the future revitalized port area. In April 2018 it was announced that the pier for the touristic ships and cruisers will be built on the quay, constructed near the Old Port Authority (&quot;Stara Kapetanija&quot;) where the old Zemun port was located. It is designed to accept ships up to long and wide. It is the second international touristic pier in Belgrade, after the one in Savamala, on the Sava river. Construction ultimately began in June 2019 and the slabs from the previous embankment were discovered so as several submerged vessels. The pier was finished on 6 June 2020.

=== Railway ===
Gradual moving of trains from the Belgrade Main railway station to the new, Prokop station began in the early 2016. In December 2017, all but two national trains were dislocated to &quot;Belgrade Center&quot;. In the scopes of dislocation, a new, central Belgrade freight station is planned in Zemun. But, the problems arose immediately. The Prokop is still not finished, has no station building and a proper access road and public transportation connections with the rest of the city. Additionally, it has no facilities for loading and unloading cars from the auto trains nor was ever planned top have one and this facility is to be a part of the Zemun freight station. Still, in January 2018 it was announced that the Main station will be completely closed for traffic on 1 July 2018, even though none of the projects needed for a complete dislocation of the railway traffic are finished. The Prokop is incomplete, a projected main freight station in Zemun is not being adapted at all while there is even no project on a Belgrade railway beltway.

A series of temporary solutions will have to be applied. One is a defunct and deteriorated Topčider station, which will be revitalized and adapted for auto trains, until the Zemun station becomes operational. Freight station in Zemun will be located between the already existing stations Zemun and Zemun Polje, on the area of . Revitalization of the existing of tracks and of buildings will be followed by the construction of the of new tracks and additional of edifices. Deadline is also 2 years, but the works will start at the end of 2018. This means that the planned Belgrade railway junction won&#x27;t be finished before 2021, at best. However, minister for transportation, Zorana Mihajlović, in December 2017 gave conflicting deadlines. For the Zemun station, she said that it should be finished by the end of 2018, even though, as of January 2018, non of the works have started.

=== Aerial ===
Batajnica Airbase with a limited civil traffic is also located in the municipality, near the Batajnica settlement.

In 1928, building company &quot;Šumadija&quot; proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called &quot;air tram&quot;. The project was planned to connect Zemun to Kalemegdan on Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project was never realized.

== Architecture, culture and education ==


White Bear Tavern is a former kafana in the neighborhood of Ćukovac. First mentioned in 1658, it is the oldest surviving edifice on the urban territory of modern Belgrade, not counting the Belgrade Fortress. However, Zemun developed completely independently from Belgrade for centuries and for the most part during the history two towns belonged to two different states. Zemun became part of the same administrative unit as Belgrade on 4 October 1929, lost a separate town status to Belgrade in 1934 and made a continuous built-up area with Belgrade only since the 1950s. Hence, the House at 10 Cara Dušana Street in Belgrade&#x27;s downtown neighborhood of Dorćol is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade, while the White Bear Tavern is titled as the oldest house in Zemun.

The first professional theatre in Zemun was established on 22 October 1969 in the Main Street (Maršala Tita at the time), as an offshoot of the National Theatre in Belgrade. Madlenianum Opera and Theatre was founded in 1997 as the first private opera in this part of Europe. The founder and the donor of Madlenianum is Madlena Zepter. Madlenianum has been organized as a model of a new musical-scenic theatre, without its permanent ensemble, but with a permanent organization and administration apparatus and a technical team.
The faculty of agriculture of the Belgrade University is located in Zemun, as well as many other important higher schools (Internal affairs, Economics, Technics and machines, Medicine, Zemun gymnasium) and institutes (Institute for agriculture and forestry, Institute for mining, world-famous Institute for corn in Zemun Polje, Institute for livestock, Institute for the implementation of the nuclear energy in agriculture, Institute for physics).

Zemun has a town museum, located in the historic Spirta House.

Two of Belgrade&#x27;s major hospitals-clinical centers are located in Zemun: &quot;KBC Zemun&quot; and &quot;KBC Bežanijska Kosa&quot;, as is the retirement home &quot;Bežanijska Kosa&quot;, the largest one in Belgrade. Churches include the Gardoš cemetery church and the Hariš chapel, Saint Nicholas, Saint Archangel Gabriel and two Roman Catholic churches.

Zemun is known for many squares, though almost all of them are small in size: &quot;Magistratski&quot;, &quot;Senjski&quot;, &quot;Veliki&quot;, &quot;Branka Radičevića&quot;, &quot;Karađorđev&quot;, &quot;Masarikov&quot;, etc. On one of them, the Zemun open green market is located. The bank of the Danube is turned into Zemunski Kej, a kilometers long promenade, with various entertainment facilities along it, including barges-cafés, amusement park and especially formerly largest hotel in Belgrade, Hotel Jugoslavija.

The remnants of the old town which existed during battles between Kingdom of Hungary and Byzantine Empire in the 12th century are known as &quot;Zemunski Grad&quot; (Zemun Town). Today visible ruins however are of the medieval fortress (angular towers and parts of the defending wall) of the 1521 Ottoman siege. The &quot;Kula Sibinjanin Janka&quot; (The tower of Janos Hunyadi) or the Millennium tower was built and officially opened on August 20, 1896, to celebrate a thousand years of Hungarian settlement in the Pannonian plain. The tower was built as a combination of various styles, mostly influenced by the Roman elements. Being a natural lookout, it was used by Zemun&#x27;s firemen for decades. Today, the tower is better known after the Janos Hunyadi, who actually died in the old fortress four and a half centuries before the tower was built. In general, Gardoš is today the most recognizable symbol of Zemun. For the most part, the neighborhood preserved its old looks, with narrow, still mostly cobblestoned streets unsuitable for modern vehicles, and individual residential houses.

There are five official parks in Zemun, though there are much more green areas in general. The largest and the oldest is the City park (&quot;Gradski park&quot;, opened in 1886). There are also the Kej Oslobođenja park (on the quay, renovated in November 2007), Kalvarija, Jelovac and Army park. There are also five official forests: three along the highway (Autoput Forest, Belgrade-Zagreb Highway Forests and Nacional Forest), which cover , Bežanijska Kosa Forest, also along the highway (), and Great and Little War Islands ().

== Sport ==
The most popular football club in Zemun is FK Zemun, which plays currently in the Serbian First League, the second tier of Serbian football league system, and Teleoptik Zemun, which plays currently in the Serbian League Belgrade. Teleoptik is nowadays generally considered Partizan Belgrade&#x27;s farm team, with many of Partizan&#x27;s youth players playing there to gain experience before being promoted to the first team. The municipality has several smaller stadiums, including those of FK Zemun, the Zemun Stadium. One of Belgrade&#x27;s major sports halls, the Pinki Hall, which is Named after Boško Palkovljević Pinki, is also located in Zemun.

<doc id="249785" wikidata="Q16145716" url="?curid=249785" title="Tom Rukavina">
<text>Thomas Rukavina (August 23, 1950 – January 7, 2019) was an American politician and a Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1987 to 2013. In 2010 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Minnesota, seeking the DFL nomination. He was a St. Louis County commissioner from 2015 to 2018.

==Early life==
Rukavina was born in Virginia, Minnesota, of Croatian and Italian descent, and graduated from the University of Minnesota Duluth with a Bachelor of Arts degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in political science. He first held elected office in the 1970s on the Virginia school board and the Pike Town Board. Before becoming a full-time legislator, he worked in various positions, including at the Minntac taconite plant, as a logger and a naturalist at the Ironworld Discovery Center in Chisholm, Minnesota, and as an assistant director at Giants Ridge Ski Area.

==Minnesota House of Representatives==
Rukavina was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives for thirteen terms, serving from 1987 to 2013. He represented District 5A, which included the Mesabi Range in St. Louis County in northeastern Minnesota. In 2012, he announced he would not seek reelection, citing his frustration with the partisan atmosphere at the state Capitol.

Rukavina proposed a bill that would ban the sale of foreign-made American flags in Minnesota. The bill later passed into law.

In 2009, Rukavina opposed allowing the University of Minnesota to sell beer and wine only in premium seats at TCF Bank Stadium. He insisted that the University alter its policy to sell alcohol to all legal drinkers throughout the stadium, including its own students.

==2010 gubernatorial campaign==
On July 23, 2009, Rukavina filed paperwork for an exploratory committee for Governor of Minnesota, making his candidacy official in early September at Bayfront Park in Duluth. He was later endorsed by Congressman Jim Oberstar. At the DFL state convention he dropped out of the race and endorsed Margaret Anderson Kelliher.

==Personal life==
Rukavina was arrested on July 31, 2004, for fourth-degree drunk driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.15. He pleaded guilty to the charge.

Rukavina was married to Jean who previously had three children and Rukavina had two children. Rukavina&#x27;s daughter Ida worked for U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar. Ida Rukavina was then Executive Director of the Range Association of Municipalities and Schools (RAMS) starting in July 2021 before being appointed by MN Governor Tim Walz as the new commissioner of Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board in December 2022. He was friends with late U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, who was flying to attend the funeral of Rukavina&#x27;s father when his plane fatally crashed in October 2002.

==Death==
Rukavina died of leukemia on January 7, 2019, at the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis, aged 68.

In response to his death, Governor Tim Walz said: &quot;There&#x27;s folks who put their life into serving Minnesota, and Tom Rukavina was one of those&quot;. U.S. Senator Klobuchar said that: &quot;Rukavina understood the dignity of hard work, and was a force for Iron Range workers and their families&quot;. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison remembered Rukavina as a &quot;friend, public servant, and a fierce defender of working people&quot; on a statement on Twitter.

== Legacy ==
The Thomas Rukavina Memorial Bridge was named after him after a bill introduced by Dave Tomassoni was passed by the Minnesota legislature. The bridge is located in the Bridgeview Pocket Park on the Mesabi Trail. A public ceremony was held on August 19, 2021, after the bridge was renamed. Guests at the ceremony included U.S. senator Amy Klobuchar.

<text>The Continental Basketball Association (CBA), originally known as the Eastern Pennsylvania Basketball League, and later as the Eastern Professional Basketball League and the Eastern Basketball Association, was a men&#x27;s professional basketball minor league in the United States from 1946 to 2009.

== History ==
===20th century===

The Continental Basketball Association was founded on April 23, 1946, under its previous name, the Eastern Pennsylvania Basketball League. It went on to bill itself as the &quot;World&#x27;s Oldest Professional Basketball League&quot;, since its founding pre-dated the founding of the National Basketball Association by two months. The league fielded six franchises, five of which were in Pennsylvania: Allentown, Hazleton, Lancaster, Reading, and Wilkes-Barre. A sixth team, Binghamton, was located in New York, but moved to Pottsville in Pennsylvania mid-season. 

In 1948, the league was renamed the Eastern Professional Basketball League, and additional franchises were added in three additional Pennsylvania cities, Williamsport, Scranton, and Sunbury, three New Jersey cities, Trenton, Camden, and Asbury Park, three in Connecticut, New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport, and in Wilmington, Delaware, and Springfield, Massachusetts.

From the 1950s through the 1960s, many NBA teams had unofficial quotas on the number of black players on their teams. Many players joined other professional leagues, including the EPBL. The league was fast and physical, often played in tiny, smoke-filled gyms across the Northeastern United States, and featuring the best players who could not make many NBA teams because of the quotas.

Following the lead of the American Basketball League (1961–1962) in adding a three-point line, the Eastern League added a three-point line for its 1964–65 season. Although three-point shots during the 1960s were few and far between, the Eastern League developed several scorers who used the three-point shot to their advantage.

For the 1970–71 season, the league rebranded itself the Eastern Basketball Association, operating as a professional Northeastern regional league and as an unofficial feeder system to the NBA and ABA. The CBA&#x27;s first commissioner was Harry Rudolph, father of NBA referee Mendy Rudolph. Steve A. Kauffman, currently a basketball agent, succeeded Rudolph as commissioner in 1975. Kauffman executed a plan to bring the Anchorage Northern Knights into the league beginning with the 1977–78 season. Kauffman kept the league name because he felt having a team in the Eastern League from Alaska might get the league additional notice and recognition. The establishment of the Anchorage franchise garnered national media attention, including a feature story in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

Kauffman served as commissioner until 1978, when his deputy commissioner, Jim Drucker, took the reins. Drucker&#x27;s eight-season reign was the longest in the league&#x27;s history. Drucker, son of NBA referee Norm Drucker, continued as commissioner until 1986.

As commissioner, the league was renamed the Continental Basketball Association in 1978, eventually leading to expansion across the country.

During Drucker&#x27;s term, the league expanded from 8 to 14 teams, landed its first national TV contracts and saw franchise values increase from $5,000 to $500,000, an aggregate increase in equity value from $24,000 to $7 million. The league instituted novel rule changes including sudden-death overtime, a no foul-out rule and a change in the way league standings were determined. Under the &quot;7-Point System&quot;, seven points were awarded each game: three points for winning a game and one point for every quarter a team won. As a result, a winning team would wind up with four to seven points in the standings, while a losing team could collect from zero to three points. This made for at least some fan interest even in the late stages of games that were otherwise blowouts; the trailing team could still get a standings point by winning the final quarter, especially if the team that was leading chose to rest some or all of its starters. The league used this method to calculate division standings from its implementation in 1983 until the league&#x27;s end in 2009.

After Darryl Dawkins shattered two basketball backboards during the 1979–80 NBA season, the NBA used the CBA to test an innovation as part of the basket, the breakaway rim, in the 1980–81 CBA season. Three designs were chosen to be used in games, being chosen from ten prototype designs. Several college basketball players were asked to try to break the rims before being introduced in the CBA. When force was placed upon the spring-loaded rim, it would be pulled down, then spring safely back in place. The NBA and CBA adopted the most resilient design among the three for the 1981–82 season.

Also during this time, the CBA created a series of halftime promotions. The most successful was the &quot;1 Million Dollar CBA Supershot&quot;. In an era where the typical basketball halftime promotion, even in NCAA Division I and the NBA, featured a winning prize worth less than $100, the CBA&#x27;s Supershot, created in 1983, offered a grand prize of $1 million if a randomly selected fan could hit one shot from the far foul line, . No one won the insured prize, but the shot attracted national media coverage in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. 

In 1984, the CBA signed a cable television contract with BET with 10 CBA games televised on a tape delay. For national media attention, the league created the &quot;CBA Sportscaster Contest&quot; to select a color commentator for its BET telecasts. With tryouts nationwide, the promotion was featured on the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and other media. The contest was won by a NJ high school basketball coach, Bill Lange, who later coached the Philadelphia Spirit minor league team in the United States Basketball League.

After two tape-delayed seasons on BET, CBA games moved to ESPN, with 13 games televised live. ESPN sportscaster Bob Ley did the play-by-play and former NBA player and coach Kevin Loughery provided color commentary. Drucker left as Commissioner, and his TV production company, Global Sports, produced the ESPN telecasts.

In 1985, the CBA followed with the &quot;Ton-of-Money Free Throw&quot;, which featured a prize of of pennies ($5,000) if a randomly selected fan could make just one free throw. Two of fourteen contestants were successful. The next year, the league featured the &quot;Easy Street Shootout&quot;. In that shootout, 14 contestants, one from each CBA city, were selected and the person making the longest shot won a $1,000,000 zero-coupon bond. The winner was Don Mattingly of the Evansville Thunder, unrelated to the New York Yankee baseball player. After the league&#x27;s 1985 All-Star Game in Casper, Wyoming, the CBA invited fans to make a paper airplane from the centerfold of their game program, each identified with a unique serial number, and attempt to throw it through the moon roof of a new Ford Thunderbird parked at mid-court. Four fans were successful and a tie-breaker determined the winner who drove home with the new $17,000 car.

In August 1999, the CBA&#x27;s teams were purchased by an investment group led by former NBA star Isiah Thomas. The group bought all of the individually owned franchises of the CBA, in a $10 million acquisition. Over the course of the next 18 months, Thomas was faced with a plethora of business troubles, losing the league&#x27;s partnership with the NBA and ultimately abandoning the league into a blind trust that left teams unable to meet payroll or pay bills. The combined-ownership plan was unsuccessful and, by 2001, the CBA had declared bankruptcy and ceased operations; it folded on February 8, 2001, without managing to complete the 2000–01 season.

===21st century===
Before the 2000–01 season, the CBA signed a television contract with BET to broadcast up to 18 games, including the CBA All-Star Game, although the CBA folded midway through the season. Several of its teams briefly joined the now-defunct International Basketball League.

Highlights of Thomas&#x27;s ownership of the CBA included:

*August 3, 1999: Former NBA star Isiah Thomas purchases the CBA (the entire league including all the teams and its marketing entity, CBA Properties) for $10 million. He says that the league will now operate as a single-owner entity, and the CBA will continue to be the official developmental league of the NBA.
*October 7, 1999: Sale of the CBA to Thomas is finalized. Thomas pays $5 million up front, agreeing to make four additional payments to the CBA&#x27;s former team owners for the remainder of the debt.
*October 24, 1999: He announces salary cuts in the CBA. The average salary of $1,500 per week will be reduced to $1,100, with rookies getting $800. Thomas&#x27; reasoning is that by reducing the number of veterans in the league, there will be more young players available for NBA teams.
*March 2000: The NBA offers Thomas $11 million plus a percentage of the profits for the CBA. Thomas chooses not to sell.
*June 28, 2000: Thomas is offered the head coaching job of the NBA&#x27;s Indiana Pacers. Since NBA rules forbid a coach from owning his own league (as it would be a conflict of interest), Thomas is obliged to sell the CBA. On this day, Thomas signs a letter of intent to sell the CBA to the NBA Players&#x27; Association.
*Summer 2000: After 20 years of using the CBA as its developmental league, the NBA announces it will form its own minor-league feeder system, creating the National Basketball Development League (later the NBA Development League). The CBA will no longer be the NBA&#x27;s official developmental league following the end of the 2001 season.
*October 2, 2000: Thomas places the league into a blind trust and becomes head coach of the Pacers. 
*February 8, 2001: The CBA suspends play midway through the 2000–2001 season. The blind trust that had hoped to find a new owner for the league abandons its efforts, and the league has over $2 million in debts. The teams are offered back to their original owners for a $1 simple consideration, and several owners accept the offer. Many more refuse, and their clubs go under.
*February 24, 2001: The CBA declares bankruptcy. Five former CBA team owners repurchase their franchises and join the rival International Basketball League (IBL) to finish the season. Other owners choose to allow their franchises to fail, rather than cover debts that were not theirs originally.
*Summer 2001: The IBL folds.
*November 2001: The CBA reorganizes for the 2001–02 season as former CBA franchises in Rockford, Gary, Grand Rapids and Sioux Falls merge with the smaller International Basketball Association (IBA), which has franchises in Bismarck (Dakota Wizards), Fargo (Fargo-Moorhead Beez) and Saskatoon (Saskatchewan Hawks). The Flint (Michigan) Fuze join as an expansion team.
*November 16, 2001: The first game in the history of the National Basketball Developmental League is played.

In fall 2001, CBA and IBL teams merged with the International Basketball Association and purchased the assets of the defunct CBA (including its name, logo and records) from the bankruptcy trustee and resumed operations as the CBA, assuming the former league&#x27;s identity and history. The league obtained eight new franchises (for a total of ten) for the 2006 season. The Atlanta Krunk Wolverines and Vancouver Dragons deferred their participation until the 2007–2008 season and the Utah Eagles folded on January 25, 2007. The CBA&#x27;s 2007–08 season began with 10 franchises, the greatest number of teams to start a CBA season since the 2000–01 season. In addition to six returning franchises the CBA added three expansion teams – the Oklahoma Cavalry, the Rio Grande Valley Silverados and East Kentucky Miners; the Atlanta Krunk joined the league after sitting out the 2006–07 season.

The 2008–2009 season began with only four teams, instead of the expected five. The Pittsburgh Xplosion folded under unclear circumstances, and the league scheduled games against American Basketball Association (ABA) teams for the first month of the season in an attempt to stay solvent. The maneuver was not enough. On February 2, 2009, the league announced a halt to operations, turning a scheduled series between the Albany Patroons and Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry into the league-championship series.

=== Integration ===
During the 1946–47 Eastern League season, the Hazleton Mountaineers had three African-American players on their roster during the season – Bill Brown, Zack Clayton and John Isaacs. Isaacs previously played with an all-black touring squad (the Washington Bears), while Brown and Clayton were alumni of the Harlem Globetrotters. During the 1955–56 season, the Hazleton Hawks Eastern League team was the first integrated professional league franchise with an all-black starting lineup: Tom Hemans, Jesse Arnelle, Fletcher Johnson, Sherman White and Floyd Lane. The all-black Dayton Rens competed in the 1948–49 National Basketball League.

== CBA–NBA relationship ==
During the early years of the CBA, when it was known as the EPBL, the league&#x27;s relationship with the NBA was frosty at best. The NBA sent several players to the Eastern League for extra playing time, and for several seasons two Eastern League teams played the opening game of a New Year&#x27;s Eve doubleheader at Madison Square Garden (with the NBA playing the nightcap game). Although the NBA played exhibition games with the Eastern League during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the exhibition games ceased in 1954 when the Eastern League signed several college basketball players involved in point-shaving gambling scandals during their college years, including Jack Molinas, Sherman White, Floyd Layne, and Al Roth. The Eastern League also signed 7-foot center Bill Spivey, the former University of Kentucky standout who was accused of point-shaving; although Spivey was acquitted of all charges, the NBA still banned him from the league for life.

After a few seasons, however, the NBA and EPBL resumed exhibition games in the 1950s (including a 1956 matchup in which the NBA&#x27;s Syracuse Nationals lost to the EPBL&#x27;s Wilkes-Barre Barons at Wilkes-Barre&#x27;s home court). Other EPBL-NBA exhibition matchups include an October 1959 contest in which the New York Knicks defeated the Allentown Jets 131–102 at Allentown; and a contest in April 1961, in which the Boston Celtics also played an exhibition contest against Allentown (defeating the Eastern Leaguers soundly). The Eastern League became a haven for players who wanted to play professionally, but were barred from the NBA because of academic restrictions. Even though Ray Scott had left the University of Portland two months after his matriculation, the NBA could not sign Scott to a contract until Scott&#x27;s class graduated. The EPBL, however, could sign him and Scott played 77 games for the Allentown Jets before later joining the NBA&#x27;s Detroit Pistons.

By the 1967–68 season, the Eastern League lost many of its players when the upstart American Basketball Association formed. Players such as Lavern &quot;Jelly&quot; Tart, Willie Somerset, Art Heyman and Walt Simon (all of whom were all-stars in the Eastern League a year before) were now in ABA uniforms. The ABA continued to siphon off NBA and Eastern League players, leaving the Eastern League with only six teams in 1972 and four teams in 1975. Only the ABA-NBA merger in June 1976 kept the Eastern League alive, as an influx of players from defunct ABA teams joined the league.

In 1979, the NBA signed four players from the newly renamed CBA. The CBA, receiving no compensation from the NBA for these signings, sued the NBA. The suit was settled and in exchange for the right to sign any CBA player at any time, the NBA paid the CBA $115,000; it also paid the CBA $80,000 to develop NBA referees in the CBA. During this time, the NBA created the &quot;10-day-contract&quot;, where an NBA team could sign a CBA player for 10 days, at the &quot;pro rata&quot; NBA minimum salary (as per the NBA&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement). The NBA team could re-sign him to a second 10-day contract. After the second 10-day contract, the team had to either return the player to his CBA team or sign him for the balance of the NBA regular season. The CBA teams, in turn, received compensation for each 10-day contract.

By 1980, the CBA had become the official development league of the NBA. CBA teams had exclusive rights to players released by their NBA affiliated teams. NBA teams could sign players from any CBA team. By 1986, 54 former CBA players were playing in the NBA.
In 1987 the CBA announced that teams were allowed to sign players banned for drug use by the NBA. Mitchell Wiggins, who was suspended by the NBA for cocaine use, was one of the first players signed in the CBA under the new rule that was implemented in conjunction with the NBA and NBA Players Association.

During the 1993–94 season, the NBA–CBA affiliate relationship was replaced by an annual draft of NBA players. The draft gave CBA teams exclusive negotiating rights with NBA players in the event of their release from an NBA roster. The CBA team owned exclusive rights to the draftee in perpetuity.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the NBA&#x27;s relationship with the CBA grew to the point where dozens of former CBA stars found their way onto NBA rosters, including Tim Legler (Omaha Racers), Mario Elie (Albany Patroons), and John Starks (Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets). The CBA also sent qualified coaches to the NBA, including Phil Jackson (Albany Patroons), Bill Musselman (Tampa Bay Thrillers), Eric Musselman (Rapid City Thrillers), Flip Saunders (LaCrosse Catbirds) and George Karl (Montana Golden Nuggets). In 2001, the NBA formed its own minor league, the National Basketball Development League (the NBDL or &quot;D-League&quot;). At the end of the 2005–2006 season, three current and one expansion CBA franchises jumped to the NBDL. During the 2006–07 season no players were called up from the CBA to the NBA, ending a streak of over 30 seasons of at least one call-up per year. That soon led to the beginning of the end for the CBA.

== Rules and innovations ==
The CBA followed largely the same basketball rules as the NBA and most other professional leagues. Sometimes rules adopted by the CBA on an experimental basis later became permanent in that league and were adopted by other levels of basketball as well; others remained unique to the CBA. From 1978 through 1986, CBA commissioner Jim Drucker created several new rules to raise fan interest, which were then adopted by the league:
*Season standings were changed from a win–loss percentage, to the &quot;7 Point System&quot;. During each game, seven points were awarded—three for winning the game, and one point for each quarter in which a team outscored their opponent. (If each team scored the same number of points in a quarter, the point for that quarter was halved.) Team standings were determined by the number of points, rather than win–loss percentage.
*A player could not foul out of the game; after a player&#x27;s sixth personal foul, the opposing team receives an automatic free throw.
*During the 1982–83 and 1983–84 seasons, overtime games were decided by the team that scored the first three points in overtime. During the 1984–85 season, that rule was modified so that victory went to the first team to &quot;lead&quot; by three points in overtime. By the 1987–88 season, that rule was superseded by a standard five-minute overtime period to determine the winner.
*During the 1981–82 season, the CBA created a &quot;no call box&quot;—an area in front of the baskets in which any contact in the box between offensive and defensive players was to be an automatic defensive foul. This rule, which was designed to encourage drives to the hoop, caused more confusion than scoring, and was quickly abandoned. A variation of this rule, using an arc rather than a box, was adopted by the NBA in 2002, and later also by the NCAA.
*For a few years in the early 1980s the CBA offered a money-back guarantee—returning a patron&#x27;s money if, before the start of the second quarter, the fan left the game. There was also a &quot;national season ticket&quot;, allowing fans to attend any CBA game within a 100-mile radius of their hometown.
*May 1984: At a league meeting in Louisville, Kentucky, three rules were changed; fouling a shooter on a three-point shot would result in three shots as opposed to two (later adopted by all levels of basketball), a win in overtime could only be determined when a team led by three points and a clear path foul was implemented.
*Drucker also created a series of high-profile, big-money promotions that attracted increased attendance, league sponsorship and media interest. From 1984 to 1986, &quot;The 1 Million Dollar CBA Supershot&quot; offered a $1,000,000 annuity prize for a fan selected at random at halftime who made a 3/4-court shot. Although no fan won that one, in 1986 one fan did win a $1 million zero-coupon bond. The winner, Don Mattingly, unrelated to the New York Yankee player with the same name, won the bond in the &quot;CBA Easy Street Shootout&quot; at the 1986 CBA All-Star Game in Tampa, Florida. Other promotions included the &quot;Ton of Money Free Throw&quot;, which consisted of 2,000 pounds of pennies ($5,000) for making a foul shot, and &quot;The Fly-In, Drive-Away&quot; Contest where each fan received a paper airplane with a distinct serial number. At halftime a new car, with the sunroof opened, was driven to mid-court and the fan who threw his airplane into the sun roof won the car. A Ford Thunderbird was won by a fan at the CBA All-Star Game in Casper, Wyoming, in 1984.
*October 1985: A contest was held by the CBA to find a fan to be a color commentator on the &quot;CBA Game of the Week&quot; broadcast. The requirements for the contest was that the applicant had no prior broadcasting experience. The league set up a 24-hour phone number (212-828-8686) and a post office box where applicants could send their auditions.
*October 21, 1985: The CBA announced they would keep statistics on slam dunks. The CBA rosters were increased from nine spots to ten. A rule change was implemented calling for a jump ball at the beginning of every quarter. A ball similar to the red white and blue basketball popularized in the American Basketball Association was used for the 1985–86 season.
*June 1987: The CBA Board of Directors voted unanimously to extend the season to 54 games. The salary cap was adjusted to reflect the increased games. A five-minute overtime period was approved, scrapping the previous overtime rule that required a team to lead by three points to win.

== CBA draft ==
The CBA established a draft in 1985, following the NBA&#x27;s decision to reduce its draft from 10 rounds to 7. This allowed the CBA teams to have a wider selection of players: the selection criteria were the same as the NBA draft. As with the NBA draft, players had to renounce their college eligibility if they wanted to declare early. While initially the draft was limited to players who were not drafted in the NBA, this later changed, and on several occasions players were drafted by both the NBA and the CBA. Some examples include Nick Van Exel (1993, Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA and Rapid City Thrillers of the CBA), Dontonio Wingfield (1994, Seattle SuperSonics and Rapid City Thrillers), Stephen Jackson (1997, Phoenix Suns and La Crosse Bobcats), and Jason Hart (2000, Milwaukee Bucks and Idaho Stampede).

CBA franchises usually selected players who had the higher chance to sign for them instead of signing overseas or in the NBA, even though some teams used their picks in the later rounds to select players who were likely to be drafted in the NBA, in the event these players were cut in the preseason. Some teams also used their picks for publicity: for example, Cheryl Miller, a female player who played for USC in college, was selected by the Rockford Lightning with the 57 pick in the 1986 CBA draft; in the 1994 CBA draft Mexican soccer player Jorge Campos was drafted by the Mexico Aztecas, despite his ineligibility. In 1997, Lamar Odom, then a highly recruited high school prospect, was given the opportunity to enter the CBA draft and choose the team he wanted to play for, reversing the traditional drafting process; Odom, however, decided not to hire an agent and opted to play in college.

<doc id="249787" wikidata="Q305477" url="?curid=249787" title="Sen no Rikyū">
<text>, also known simply as Rikyū, was a Japanese tea master considered the most important influence on the &quot;chanoyu&quot;, the Japanese &quot;Way of Tea&quot;, particularly the tradition of &quot;wabi-cha&quot;. He was also the first to emphasize several key aspects of the ceremony, including rustic simplicity, directness of approach and honesty of self. Originating from the Sengoku and Azuchi–Momoyama periods, these aspects of the tea ceremony persist. Rikyū is known by many names; for consistency, he will be referred to as Rikyū in this article. 

There are three &quot;iemoto&quot; (&quot;sōke&quot;), or &#x27;head houses&#x27; of the Japanese Way of Tea, that are directly descended from Rikyū: the Omotesenke, Urasenke, and Mushakōjisenke, all three of which are dedicated to passing forward the teachings of their mutual family founder, Rikyū. They are collectively called .

==Early life==
Rikyū was born in Sakai in present-day Osaka Prefecture. His father was a warehouse owner named , who later in life also used the family name Sen, and his mother was . His childhood name was .

As a young man, Rikyū studied tea under the townsman of Sakai named Kitamuki Dōchin (1504–62), and at nineteen, through Dōchin&#x27;s introduction, he began to study tea under Takeno Jō&#x27;ō, who is also associated with the development of the wabi aesthetic in tea ceremony. He is believed to have received the Buddhist name from the Rinzai Zen priest Dairin Sōtō (1480–1568) of Nanshū-ji in Sakai. He married a woman known as Hōshin Myōju (d. 1577) around when he was 21. Rikyū also underwent Zen training at Daitoku-ji in Kyoto. Not much is known about his middle years.

==Later years==
In 1579, at the age of 58, Rikyū became a tea master for Oda Nobunaga and, following Nobunaga&#x27;s death in 1582, he was a tea master for Toyotomi Hideyoshi. His relationship with Hideyoshi quickly deepened, and he entered Hideyoshi&#x27;s circle of confidants, effectively becoming the most influential figure in the world of . In 1585, as he needed extra credentials to enter the Imperial Palace in order to help at a tea gathering that would be given by Hideyoshi for Emperor Ōgimachi, the emperor bestowed upon him the Buddhist lay name and title . Another major event of Hideyoshi&#x27;s that Rikyū played a central role in was the Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony, held by Hideyoshi at the Kitano Tenman-gū in 1587.

It was during his later years that Rikyū began to use very tiny, rustic tea rooms referred as (&#x27;grass hermitage&#x27;), such as the two-tatami mat tea room named Tai-an, which can be seen today at Myōki-an temple in Yamazaki, a suburb of Kyoto, and which is credited to his design. This tea room has been designated as a National Treasure. He also developed many implements for tea ceremony, including flower containers, teascoops, and lid rests made of bamboo, and also used everyday objects for tea ceremony, often in novel ways.

Raku teabowls were originated through his collaboration with a tile-maker named Raku Chōjirō. Rikyū had a preference for simple, rustic items made in Japan, rather than the expensive Chinese-made items that were fashionable at the time. Though not the inventor of the philosophy of &quot;wabi-sabi&quot;, which finds beauty in the very simple, Rikyū is among those most responsible for popularizing it, developing it, and incorporating it into tea ceremony. He created a new form of tea ceremony using very simple instruments and surroundings. This and his other beliefs and teachings came to be known as (the grass-thatched hermitage style of ), or more generally, . This line of that his descendants and followers carried on was recognized as the .

A writer and poet, the tea master referred to the ware and its relationship with the tea ceremony, saying, &quot;Though you wipe your hands and brush off the dust and dirt from the vessels, what is the use of all this fuss if the heart is still impure?&quot;

Two of his primary disciples were Nanbō Sōkei (; dates unknown), a somewhat legendary Zen priest; and Yamanoue Sōji (1544–90), a townsman of Sakai. Another was Furuta Oribe (1544-1615), who became a celebrated tea master after Rikyū&#x27;s death. Nanbō is credited as the original author of the &quot;Nanpō roku&quot;, a record of Rikyū&#x27;s teachings. There is, however, some debate as to whether Nanbō even existed, and some scholars theorize that his writings were actually by samurai litterateur Tachibana Jitsuzan (1655-1708), who claimed to have found and transcribed these texts. Yamanoue&#x27;s chronicle, the (), gives commentary about Rikyū&#x27;s teachings and the state of at the time of its writing.

Rikyū had a number of children, including a son known in history as Sen Dōan, and daughter known as Okame. This daughter became the bride of Rikyū&#x27;s second wife&#x27;s son by a previous marriage, known in history as Sen Shōan. Due to many complex circumstances, Sen Shōan, rather than Rikyū&#x27;s legitimate heir, Dōan, became the person counted as the 2nd generation in the Sen-family&#x27;s tradition of (see at schools of Japanese tea ceremony).

Rikyū also wrote poetry, and practiced &quot;ikebana&quot;.&lt;includeonly&gt;flowers for chanoyu are not called ikebana; need verification about him practicing ikebana&lt;/includeonly&gt;

One of his favourite gardens was said to be at Chishaku-in in Kyoto.

==Death==
Although Rikyū had been one of Hideyoshi&#x27;s closest confidants, because of crucial differences of opinion and because he was too independent, Hideyoshi ordered him to commit ritual suicide. One year earlier, after the Siege of Odawara (1590), his famous disciple Yamanoue Sōji was tortured and decapitated on Hideyoshi&#x27;s orders. While Hideyoshi&#x27;s reason may never be known for certain, it is known that Rikyū committed &quot;seppuku&quot; at his residence within Hideyoshi&#x27;s Jurakudai palace in Kyoto in 1591 on the 28th day of the 2nd month (of the traditional Japanese lunar calendar; or April 21 when calculated according to the modern Gregorian calendar), at the age of seventy.
According to Okakura Kakuzō in &quot;The Book of Tea&quot;, Rikyū&#x27;s last act was to hold an exquisite tea ceremony. After serving all his guests, he presented each piece of the tea-equipage for their inspection, along with an exquisite &quot;kakemono&quot;, which Okakura described as &quot;a wonderful writing by an ancient monk dealing with the evanescence of all things&quot;. Rikyū presented each of his guests with a piece of the equipment as a souvenir, with the exception of the bowl, which he shattered, as he uttered the words: &quot;Never again shall this cup, polluted by the lips of misfortune, be used by man.&quot; As the guests departed, one remained to serve as witness to Rikyū&#x27;s death. Rikyū&#x27;s last words, which he wrote down as a death poem, were in verse, addressed to the dagger with which he took his own life:

When Hideyoshi was building his lavish residence at Fushimi the following year, he remarked that he wished its construction and decoration to be pleasing to Rikyū. Hideyoshi was known for his temper, and is said to have expressed regret at his treatment of Rikyū.

Rikyū&#x27;s grave is located at Jukōin temple in the Daitoku-ji compound in Kyoto; his posthumous Buddhist name is Fushin&#x27;an Rikyū Sōeki Koji.

Memorials for Rikyū are observed annually by many schools of Japanese tea ceremony. The Omotesenke school&#x27;s annual memorial takes place at the family&#x27;s headquarters each year on March 27, and the Urasenke school&#x27;s takes place at its own family&#x27;s headquarters each year on March 28. The three Sen families (Omotesenke, Urasenke, Mushakōjisenke) take turns holding a memorial service on the 28th of every month, at their mutual family temple, the subsidiary temple Jukōin at Daitoku-ji temple.

==Rikyū&#x27;s Seven High-Status Disciples==
The () (&#x27;Seven Foremost Disciples&#x27;, &#x27;Seven Luminaries&#x27;) is a set of seven high-ranking daimyō or generals who were also direct disciples of Sen no Rikyū: Maeda Toshinaga, Gamō Ujisato, Hosokawa Tadaoki, Furuta Oribe, Makimura Toshisada, Dom Justo Takayama, and Shimayama Munetsuna. The seven-member set was first mentioned by Rikyū&#x27;s grandson Sen no Sōtan. In a 1663 list given by Sōtan&#x27;s son (and fourth-generation head of the Sen Sōsa lineage of tea masters), Maeda Toshinaga is replaced by Seta Masatada.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Rikyu&quot; (, , 1989) is Hiroshi Teshigahara&#x27;s film about the master. The film focuses on the late stages of life of Rikyū, during the highly turbulent Sengoku period of feudal Japan. The film won a number of awards. 

&quot;Death of a Tea Master&quot; (, , also known as &quot;: Honkakubo&#x27;s Student Writings&quot;) is a 1989 biographical drama film directed by Kei Kumai with Toshiro Mifune as the lead character. It is based on the events surrounding his ritual suicide. It was entered into the main competition at the 43rd Venice International Film Festival, in which it won the Silver Lion.

&quot;Hyouge Mono&quot; () is a &quot;manga&quot; written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Yamada. is a fictional retelling of the era in which Sen no Rikyū lived, and how close tea culture was to the world of politics. It won several comic awards and was adapted into an &quot;anime&quot; series in 2011. 

A period drama about Rikyū&#x27;s life and work titled by film director Mitsutoshi Tanaka was released in 2013, starring kabuki actor Ichikawa Ebizō XI, Rei Dan, Akira Emoto, and Seiji Fukushi. It is based on Kenichi Yamamoto&#x27;s novel of the same name.

Sen no Rikyū is a character in the &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot; franchise, introduced in the 2015 game &quot;Sengoku Basara 4&quot;. Rikyū is portrayed with two split personalities - the peaceful and elegant Wabisuke, and the irreverent and aggressive Sabisuke – in reference to the philosophy of wabi-sabi that the actual Rikyū popularized. In the game, Rikyū is a former tea master to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and he is on the run after Hideyoshi ordered him to commit ritual suicide.
Sen no Rikyū is one of the main characters in &quot;Flower and Sword&quot; (), a 2017 tragicomical movie by Tetsuo Shinohara. The role of Rikyū is performed by Kōichi Satō.

Sen no Rikyū was added as a playable character to the game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; in 2022 in the GUDAGUDA 7 event as a 5-star Berserker-class Servant. In &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, he is illustrated as a female dressed in traditional Japanese clothing with white and grey hair. The Servant&#x27;s Noble Phantasm animation shows him making tea and serving it to the enemy before dealing damage.

The show consists of several segments each week, most of which involve the host interviewing a scientist about a recent discovery or publication, combined with in-depth documentaries; however, from time to time the show does a special &quot;Question Show&quot; episode, during which the format consists of scientists answering questions submitted by listeners.

&quot;Quirks &amp; Quarks&quot; has offered listeners Internet audio streams and MP3 downloads on its web page since 1993. The MP3 audio files have been archived on the program web site, going back to Sept. 2006. In 2005, &quot;Quirks&quot; became the first major CBC show available as a podcast. Since the program began, it has won more than 80 national and international journalism awards, including the prestigious Walter Sullivan Award (twice) and the Science Writing Award from the American Institute of Physics (twice).

In the mid-2000s, the CBC began repackaging episodes of &quot;Quirks &amp; Quarks&quot; into podcast segments. On November 28, 2006, the &quot;Quirks &amp; Quarks&quot; podcast was one of the top 10 downloads on the iTunes podcast chart.

<doc id="249800" wikidata="Q591177" url="?curid=249800" title="Frederick James Furnivall">
<text>Frederick James Furnivall (4 February 1825 – 2 July 1910) was an English philologist, best known as one of the co-creators of the &quot;New English Dictionary&quot;. He founded a number of learned societies on early English literature and made pioneering and massive editorial contributions to the subject, of which the most notable was his parallel text edition of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. He was one of the founders of and teachers at the London Working Men&#x27;s College and a lifelong campaigner against injustice.

==Life==

Frederick James Furnivall was born on 4 February 1825 in Egham, Surrey, the son of a surgeon who had made his fortune from running the Great Fosters lunatic asylum. He was educated at University College, London, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he took an undistinguished mathematics degree. He was called to the bar from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1849 and practised desultorily until 1870.

In 1862 Furnivall married Eleanor Nickel Dalziel ( – 1937). Some authors describe her as a lady&#x27;s maid, which would have been a socially unusual match at the time, although her social status is disputed. Some time before 1866, Furnivall lost a child, Eena, whom he described as &quot;my sweet, bright, only child&quot;. He lost his inheritance in a financial crash in 1867. When he was 58, he separated from Eleanor and their one surviving son to continue a relationship with a 21-year-old female editor named Teena Rochfort-Smith. Two months after his formal separation from Eleanor, in 1883, Rochfort-Smith suffered serious burns while burning correspondence in Goole and died.

Furnivall was a non-smoker and teetotaller all his life. He took interest in physical fitness and was a vegetarian for twenty-five years.

Furnivall died on 2 July 1910.

==&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;==
Furnivall was one of the three founders and, from 1861 to 1870, the second editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;). Despite his scholarship and enthusiasm, his stint as editor of the &quot;OED&quot; nearly ended the project. For a dictionary maker he had an unfortunate lack of patience, discipline and accuracy. After having lost the sub-editors for A, I, J, N, O, P, and W through his irascibility or caprice, he finally resigned. He continued, however, to provide thousands of quotations for the dictionary until his death. &quot;OED&quot; editor James Murray said of Furnivall: &quot;He has been by far the most voluminous of our &#x27;readers&#x27;, and the slips in his handwriting and the clippings by him from printed books, and from newspapers and magazines, form a very large fraction of the millions in the Scriptorium.&quot;

Furnivall joined the Philological Society in 1847 and was its Secretary from 1853 almost until his death in 1910 at the age of 85.

He received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Oxford and an honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Berlin. In April 1902 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

==Literary societies==
Furnivall indefatigably promoted the study of early English literature. He founded a series of literary and philological societies: the Early English Text Society (1864), the Chaucer Society (1868), the Ballad Society (1868), the New Shakspere Society (1873), the Browning Society (1881, with Emily Hickey), the Wyclif Society (1882), and the Shelley Society (1885). Some of these, notably the Early English Text Society, were very successful; all were characterised by extreme controversy. The most acrimonious of all was the New Shakspere Society, scene of a bitter dispute between Furnivall and Algernon Charles Swinburne.

These societies were primarily textual publishing ventures. Furnivall edited texts for the Early English Text Society, for the Roxburghe Club and the Rolls Series; but his most important work was on Geoffrey Chaucer. His &quot;Six-Text&quot; edition of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; was a new conception. It has been described as containing full and accurate transcriptions, though some modern scholars disagree about his merits as an editor. His work, and that of the amateurs he recruited, was often slapdash, but it was substantial, and it laid the foundation for all subsequent editions. He was one of a small group of Victorian scholars who have been credited with establishing the academic study of English literature. 

==Working Men&#x27;s College==
In the 1850s, Furnivall became involved in various Christian socialist schemes and his circle included Charles Kingsley and John Ruskin. It was through this group that he became one of the founders of the Working Men&#x27;s College, and although he later became agnostic he always retained a connection with the college. He conceived of the college as a classless, democratic community of learning. One biographer wrote that he formed there a conviction that &quot;scholarship could be pursued by quite ordinary people in a spirit of good-humoured enthusiasm&quot; that was to be the key to his later life.

==Rowing==
Furnivall was always an enthusiastic oarsman, and kept up his interest in rowing till the end of his life. With John Beesley in 1845, he introduced the new type of narrow sculling boat, and in 1886 started races on the Thames for sculling fours and sculling eights. In 1896 Furnivall founded the Hammersmith Sculling Club (now called Furnivall Sculling Club), initially for working-class girls, and he &quot;entered into its activities with his usual boyish enthusiasm, for it brought together two of his favourite activities: vigorous outdoor exercise and enjoyment of the company of young women&quot;.

Furnivall the sculler may have been the original of his acquaintance Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s character Ratty in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and it has also been suggested that he inspired the portrayal of the god Pan in the same work.

<text>The Battle of Lake Erie, also known as the Battle of Put-in-Bay, was fought on 10 September 1813, on Lake Erie off the shores of Ohio during the War of 1812. Nine vessels of the United States Navy defeated and captured six vessels of the British Royal Navy. This ensured American control of the lake for the rest of the war, which in turn allowed the Americans to recover Detroit, Michigan and win the Battle of the Thames to break the Indian confederation of Tecumseh. It was one of the largest naval battles of the War of 1812.

==Background==
===1812===
When the war broke out, the British immediately seized control of Lake Erie. They already had a small force of warships there: the sloop-of-war and the brig &quot;General Hunter&quot;. The schooner was under construction and was put into service a few weeks after the outbreak of war. These vessels were controlled by the Provincial Marine, which was a military transport service and not a naval service. Nevertheless, the Americans lacked any counter to the British armed vessels. The only American warship on Lake Erie, the brig &quot;Adams&quot;, was not ready for service at the start of the war, and when the American army of Brigadier General William Hull abandoned its invasion of Canada, &quot;Adams&quot; was pinned down in Detroit by the British batteries at Sandwich on the Canadian side of the Detroit River. The British Major-General Isaac Brock used his control of the lake to defeat Hull&#x27;s army at the Siege of Detroit, by cutting the American supply lines and rapidly transferring himself and some reinforcements to Amherstburg from where they launched a successful landing on the American side of the Detroit River.

The British took &quot;Adams&quot; when Detroit was surrendered, renaming her . Together with the brig , which had been commandeered from the Canadian North West Company, she was boarded and captured near Fort Erie on 9 October, by American sailors and soldiers led by Lieutenant Jesse Elliot. &quot;Detroit&quot; ran aground on an island in the middle of the Niagara River and was set on fire to prevent her being recaptured. &quot;Caledonia&quot; was taken to the navy yard at Black Rock and commissioned into the United States Navy. Also present at Black Rock were the schooners and and the sloop-rigged , which had all been purchased by the United States Navy and were being converted into gunboats. While the British held Fort Erie and the nearby batteries which dominated the Niagara River, all these vessels were pinned down and unable to leave Black Rock.

Late in 1812, Paul Hamilton, the United States Secretary of the Navy, had received long-time American lake mariner Daniel Dobbins, who had escaped capture at Detroit and brought information on the British forces on Lake Erie. Dobbins recommended the bay of Presque Isle in Erie, Pennsylvania as a naval base on the lake. Dobbins was dispatched to build four gunboats there, although Lieutenant Elliot objected to the lack of facilities. Another problem was that a sand bar extended across the entrance to the harbor at Presque Isle, which would prove to make it very difficult to get newly constructed U.S. ships out to open water. In September, Dobbins began directing the cutting of trees. By November, Ebenezer Crosby, a master shipwright, was hired by Dobbins to start work on the four wooden ships. Commodore Isaac Chauncey had been appointed to the command of the United States naval forces on the Great Lakes in September 1812. He made one brief visit to Erie on 1 January 1813 where he approved Dobbins&#x27;s actions and recommended collecting materials for a larger vessel, but then returned to Lake Ontario where he afterwards concentrated his energies.

===1813===
In January 1813, William Jones (who had replaced Hamilton as the United States Secretary of the Navy) ordered the construction of two brig-rigged corvettes at Presque Isle, and transferred shipwright Noah Brown there from Sackets Harbor on Lake Ontario to take charge of construction. Other than their rig and crude construction (such as using wooden pegs instead of nails because of shortages of the latter), the two brigs were close copies of the contemporary . The heaviest armament for the ships came from foundries on Chesapeake Bay, and were moved to Presque Isle only with great difficulty. (The Americans were fortunate in that some of their largest cannon had been dispatched shortly before raiding parties under Rear-Admiral George Cockburn destroyed a foundry at Frenchtown on the eastern seaboard.) However, the Americans could get other materials and fittings from Pittsburgh, which was expanding as a manufacturing center, and smaller guns were borrowed from the Army.

Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry had earlier been appointed to command on Lake Erie, through lobbying by Jeremiah B. Howell, the Senior Senator from Rhode Island, supplanting Lieutenant Elliot. He arrived at Presque Isle to take command at the end of March. Having arranged for the defense of Presque Isle, he proceeded to Lake Ontario to obtain reinforcements of seamen from Commodore Isaac Chauncey. After commanding the American schooners and gunboats at the Battle of Fort George, he then went to Black Rock where the American vessels had been released when the British abandoned Fort Erie at the end of May. Perry had them towed by draft oxen up the Niagara, an operation which took six days, and sailed with them along the shore to Presque Isle.

Meanwhile, Commander Robert Heriot Barclay was appointed to command the British squadron on Lake Erie. Another British officer had already endangered his career by refusing the appointment as success appeared unlikely. Barclay missed a rendezvous with &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; at Point Abino and was forced to make the tedious journey to Amherstburg overland, arriving on 10 June. He brought with him only a handful of officers and seamen. When he took command of his squadron, the crews of his vessels numbered only seven British seamen, 108 officers and men of the Provincial Marine (whose quality Barclay disparaged), 54 men of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles and 106 soldiers, effectively landsmen, from the 41st Foot. Nevertheless, he immediately set out in &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Lady Prevost&quot;. He first reconnoitred Perry&#x27;s base at Presque Isle and determined that it was defended by 2,000 Pennsylvania militia, with batteries and redoubts. He then cruised the eastern end of Lake Erie, hoping to intercept the American vessels from Black Rock. The weather was hazy, and he missed them.

During July and August, Barclay received two small vessels, the schooner and the sloop , which had been reconstructed at Chatham on the Thames River and attempted to complete the ship-rigged corvette at Amherstburg. Because the Americans controlled Lake Ontario and occupied the Niagara Peninsula in early 1813, supplies for Barclay had to be carried overland from York. The American victory earlier in the year at the Battle of York resulted in the guns (24-pounder carronades) intended for &quot;Detroit&quot; falling into American hands. The shortage of supplies was also exacerbated by the British retreat of Fort George, which made it exceedingly difficult to send any other stores from Lower Canada. &quot;Detroit&quot; had to be completed with a miscellany of guns from the fortifications of Amherstburg. Barclay claimed at his court martial that these guns lacked flintlock firing mechanisms and matches, and that they could be fired only by snapping flintlock pistols over powder piled in the vent holes.

Barclay repeatedly requested men and supplies from Commodore James Lucas Yeo, commanding on Lake Ontario, but received very little. The commander of the British troops on the Detroit frontier, Major-General Henry Procter, was similarly starved of soldiers and munitions by his superiors. He declined to make an attack on Presque Isle unless he was reinforced, and instead he incurred heavy losses in an unsuccessful attack on Fort Stephenson, which he mounted at the urgings of some of his Indian warriors.

===Blockades of Presque Isle and Amherstburg===
By mid-July, the American squadron was almost complete, although not yet fully manned (Perry claimed to have only 120 men fit for duty). The British squadron maintained a blockade of Presque Isle for ten days from 20 to 29 July. The harbour had a sandbar across its mouth, with only of water over it, which prevented Barclay sailing in to attack the American ships (although Barclay briefly skirmished with the defending batteries on 21 July), but also prevented the Americans leaving in fighting order. Barclay had to lift the blockade on 29 July because of shortage of supplies and bad weather. It has also been suggested that Barclay left to attend a banquet in his honour, or that he wished the Americans to cross the bar and hoped to find them in disarray when he returned. Perry immediately began to move his vessels across the sandbar. This was an exhausting task. The guns had to be removed from all the boats, and the largest of them had to be raised between &quot;camels&quot; (barges or lighters which were then emptied of ballast). When Barclay returned four days later, he found that Perry had nearly completed the task. Perry&#x27;s two largest brigs were not ready for action, but the gunboats and smaller brigs formed a line so confidently that Barclay withdrew to await the completion of &quot;Detroit&quot;.

Chauncey had dispatched 130 extra sailors under Lieutenant Jesse Elliot to Presque Isle. Although Perry described some of them as &quot;wretched&quot;, at least 50 of them were experienced sailors drafted from , then undergoing a refit in Boston, Massachusetts. Perry also had a few volunteers from the Pennsylvania militia.

His vessels first proceeded to Sandusky, where they received further contingents of volunteers from Major General William Henry Harrison&#x27;s Army of the Northwest. After twice appearing off Amherstburg, Perry established an anchorage at Put-in-Bay, Ohio on South Bass Island. For the next five weeks, Barclay was effectively blockaded and unable to move supplies to Amherstburg. His sailors, Procter&#x27;s troops, and the very large numbers of Indian warriors and their families there quickly ran out of supplies. After receiving a last-minute reinforcement of two naval officers, three warrant officers and 36 sailors transferred from a transport temporarily laid up in Quebec under Lieutenant George Bignall, Barclay had no choice but to put out again and seek battle with Perry.

In the days preceding the battle, Perry told his friend, Purser Samuel Hambleton, that he wanted a signal flag, or battle flag, to signal to his fleet when to engage the enemy. Hambleton suggested using the dying words of Perry&#x27;s friend Captain James Lawrence of the frigate , &quot;DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP&quot;. Hambleton had the flag sewn by women of Erie, and presented it to Perry the day before the battle. The flag would become an icon in American naval history.

==Battle==
On the morning of 10 September, the Americans saw Barclay&#x27;s vessels heading for them, and got under way from their anchorage at Put-in-Bay/South Bass Island. The wind was light. Barclay initially held the weather gauge, but the wind shifted and allowed Perry to close and attack. Both squadrons were in line of battle, with their heaviest vessels near the centre of the line.

The first shot was fired, from &quot;Detroit&quot;, at 11:45. Perry hoped to get his two largest brigs, his flagship and , into carronade range quickly, but in the light wind his vessels were making very little speed and &quot;Lawrence&quot; was battered by the assortment of long guns mounted in &quot;Detroit&quot; for at least 20 minutes before being able to reply effectively. When &quot;Lawrence&quot; was finally within carronade range at 12:45, her fire was not as effective as Perry hoped, her gunners apparently having overloaded the carronades with shot.

Astern of &quot;Lawrence&quot;, &quot;Niagara&quot;, under Elliot, was slow to come into action and remained far out of effective carronade range. It is possible that Elliott was under orders to engage his opposite number, &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, and that &quot;Niagara&quot; was obstructed by the unhandy &quot;Caledonia&quot;, but Elliot&#x27;s actions would become a matter of dispute between him and Perry for many years. Aboard &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, the British ship opposed to &quot;Niagara&quot;, the commander (Robert Finnis) and First Lieutenant were both killed. The next most senior officer, Lieutenant Irvine of the Provincial Marine, found that both &quot;Niagara&quot; and the American gunboats were far out of range, and passed the brig &quot;General Hunter&quot; to engage &quot;Lawrence&quot; at close range.
Although the American gunboats at the rear of the American line of battle steadily pounded the British ships in the centre of the action with raking shots from their long guns from a distance, &quot;Lawrence&quot; was reduced by the two British ships to a wreck. Four-fifths of &quot;Lawrence&quot;″s crew were killed or wounded. Both of the fleet&#x27;s surgeons were sick with &quot;lake fever&quot; (malaria), so the wounded were taken care of by the assistant, Usher Parsons. When the last gun on &quot;Lawrence&quot; became unusable, Perry decided to transfer his flag. He was rowed a half-mile (1 km) through heavy gunfire to &quot;Niagara&quot; while &quot;Lawrence&quot; was surrendered. It is said his personal servant, African American sailor Cyrus Tiffany, accompanied and protected Perry during this journey.

It was later alleged that Perry left &quot;Lawrence&quot; after the surrender, but he had actually taken down only his personal pennant, in blue bearing the motto, &quot;DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP&quot;.

When &quot;Lawrence&quot; surrendered, firing died away briefly. &quot;Detroit&quot; collided with &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, both ships being almost unmanageable with damaged rigging and almost every officer killed or severely wounded. Barclay was severely wounded and his first lieutenant was killed, leaving Lieutenant Inglis in command. Most of the smaller British vessels were also disabled and drifting to leeward. The British nevertheless expected &quot;Niagara&quot; to lead the American schooners away in retreat. Instead, once aboard &quot;Niagara&quot;, Perry dispatched Elliot to bring the schooners into closer action, while he steered &quot;Niagara&quot; at Barclay&#x27;s damaged ships, helped by the strengthening wind.

&quot;Niagara&quot; broke through the British line ahead of &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; and luffed up to fire raking broadsides from ahead of them, while &quot;Caledonia&quot; and the American gunboats fired from astern. Although the crews of &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; managed to untangle the two ships they could no longer offer any effective resistance. Both ships surrendered at about 3:00 pm. The smaller British vessels tried to flee but were overtaken and also surrendered.

Although Perry won the battle on &quot;Niagara&quot;, he received the British surrender on the deck of the &quot;Lawrence&quot;.

==Casualties==
The British lost 41 killed and 94 wounded. The surviving crews, including the wounded, numbered 306. Captain Barclay, who had previously lost his left arm in 1809, lost a leg and part of his thigh in the action while his remaining arm was rendered &quot;permanently motionless&quot;. The Americans lost 27 killed and 96 wounded, of whom 2 later died. The heaviest American casualties were suffered aboard &quot;Lawrence&quot;, which had 2 officers and 20 men killed, and 6 officers and 55 men wounded.

Of the vessels involved, the three most battered (the American brig &quot;Lawrence&quot; and the British ships &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;) were converted into hospital ships. A gale swept the lake on 13 September and dismasted &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, further shattering the already battered ships. Once the wounded had been ferried to Erie, &quot;Lawrence&quot; was restored to service for 1814, but the two British ships were effectively reduced to hulks.

==Aftermath==

Perry&#x27;s vessels and prizes were anchored and hasty repairs were underway near West Sister Island when Perry composed his now famous message to Harrison. Scrawled in pencil on the back of an old envelope, Perry wrote:
Perry next sent the following message to the Secretary of the Navy, William Jones:
Once his usable vessels and prizes were patched up, Perry ferried 2,500 American soldiers to Amherstburg, which was captured without opposition on 27 September. Meanwhile, 1,000 mounted troops led by Richard Mentor Johnson moved by land to Detroit, which also was recaptured without fighting on or about the same day. The British army under Procter had made preparations to abandon its positions even before Procter knew the result of the battle. In spite of exhortations from Tecumseh, who led the confederation of Indian tribes allied to Britain, Procter had already abandoned Amherstburg and Detroit and began to retreat up the Thames River on 27 September. Lacking supplies, Tecumseh&#x27;s Indians had no option but to accompany him. Harrison caught up with Procter&#x27;s retreating force and defeated them on 5 October at the Battle of the Thames, where Tecumseh was killed, as was his second-in command and most experienced warrior, Wyandot Chief Roundhead.

The victory on Lake Erie had disproportionate strategic import. The Americans controlled Lake Erie for the remainder of the war. This accounted for much of the Americans&#x27; successes on the Niagara peninsula in 1814 and also removed the threat of a British attack on Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Western New York.

However, an expedition in 1814 to recover Mackinac Island, Michigan on Lake Huron failed, and the Americans lost eight of their smaller vessels and prizes. (Four were destroyed when the British captured Black Rock, where they were laid up, following the Battle of Buffalo at the end of 1813, and four were boarded and captured in separate incidents on Lake Erie and Lake Huron.)

After the war, there was a bitter quarrel between Perry and Elliot over their respective parts in the action, mostly fought at second hand in the press. On the British side, Barclay was exonerated of any blame by a court-martial but was too badly injured to see service again for several years.

==Reconstructions and memorials==
In 1820 &quot;Lawrence&quot; and &quot;Niagara&quot; were intentionally sunk near Misery Bay in Lake Erie, as they had &quot;went to rot.&quot; In 1875, &quot;Lawrence&quot; was raised and moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was displayed at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. Later that year, the ship burned when the pavilion that housed it caught fire. Although &quot;Niagara&quot; was raised and restored in 1913, she subsequently fell into disrepair. She was eventually disassembled, and portions of her were used in a reconstructed &quot;Niagara&quot;, which is now on view in Erie, Pennsylvania.

The high Perry&#x27;s Monument within Perry&#x27;s Victory and International Peace Memorial now stands at Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island, commemorating the men who fought in the battle.

Another high Perry Monument is located at the eastern end of Presque Isle in Erie, Pennsylvania. It stands on a peninsula in Presque Isle Bay, where &quot;Niagara&quot; and &quot;Lawrence&quot; were built, stationed along with the rest of the American Squadron, and then scuttled after the war.

==Reasons for American victory==
Most historians attribute the American victory to what Theodore Roosevelt described as &quot;superior heavy metal&quot; by citing the greater numbers of American ships and heavy cannon. Perry&#x27;s leadership, particularly in the latter stages of the action, is also mentioned as a factor. The British historian C.S. Forester commented that &quot;it was as fortunate for the Americans that the &quot;Lawrence&quot; still possessed a boat that would float, as it was that Perry was not hit.&quot;

On the British side, William Bell served as constructor and built &quot;Detroit&quot;, which was the best-built ship on the lake. However, &quot;Detroit&quot; was built slowly, in part because of Bell&#x27;s perfectionism, and indeed, it was the only purpose-built British warship constructed on Lake Erie during the war. The guns intended for &quot;Detroit&quot; were seized by the Americans at the time of their raid on Fort York the year before. That building imbalance, given the fact that six American ships were built in the same time frame, was another important cause of the American victory although it might be argued that even if Barclay had possessed more hulls, he would have been unable to obtain armament and crews for them.

The court-martial of Captain Barclay and his surviving officers determined that the captain and his officers and men had &quot;conducted themselves in the most gallant manner,&quot; and it found that the defeat was the result of American numerical superiority, an insufficient number of able seamen, and the early fall of superior officers in the action.

<doc id="249806" wikidata="Q662533" url="?curid=249806" title="Hrólfr Kraki">
<text>Hrólfr Kraki (Old Norse: ), &quot;Hroðulf&quot;, &quot;Rolfo&quot;, &quot;Roluo&quot;, &quot;Rolf Krage&quot; (early 6th century) was a semi-legendary Danish king who appears in both Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian tradition.

Both traditions describe him as a Danish Scylding, the nephew of Hroðgar and the grandson of Healfdene. The consensus view is that Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian traditions describe the same people. Whereas the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot; do not go further than treating his relationship with Hroðgar and their animosity with Froda and Ingeld, the Scandinavian sources expand on his life as the king at Lejre and on his relationship with Halga, Hroðgar&#x27;s brother. In &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot;, it is never explained how Hroðgar and Hroðulf are uncle and nephew.

==&quot;Beowulf&quot;==
The poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; introduces Hroðulf as kinsman. Later, the text explains that Hroðulf is Hroðgar&#x27;s nephew and that &quot;each was true to the other&quot;. Hroðgar is given three siblings, brothers Heorogar and Halga and an unnamed sister, all the children of Healfdene and belonging to the royal clan known as the Scyldings. The poem does not indicate which of Hroðgar&#x27;s siblings is Hroðulf&#x27;s parent, but later Scandinavian tradition establishes this as Halga.

Hroðgar and queen Wealhþeow had two young sons, Hreðric and Hroðmund, and Hroðulf would be their guardian in case Hroðgar dies. In a deliberately ironic passage it appears that the queen trusts Hroðulf, not suspecting that he will murder her sons to claim the throne for himself:

No existence of any Hreðric or Hroðmund, sons of Hroðgar, has survived in Scandinavian sources (although Hreðric has been suggested to be the same person as Hroerekr/Roricus, a Danish king generally described as a son or successor of Ingjald). This Hroerekr is sometimes said to have been killed by Hrólfr, vindicating the foreshadowing in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

The Scyldings were in conflict with another clan or tribe named the Heaðobards led by their king Froda and his son Ingeld. It is in relation to this war that Hroðulf is mentioned in the other Anglo-Saxon poem where he appears, &quot;Widsith&quot;.

===Hrólf and Hroðulf===
A common identification is that Hrólf Kraki is the same as the character Hroðulf (Hroðgar&#x27;s nephew) in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. There seems to be some foreshadowing in &quot;Beowulf&quot; that Hroðulf will attempt to usurp the throne from Hroðgar&#x27;s sons Hreðric and Hroðmund, a deed that also seems to be referred to in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 2), where we find: &quot;... our king, who laid low Rorik, the son of Bok the covetous, and wrapped the coward in death.&quot; &quot;Rorik&quot; is the form we would expect &quot;Hreðric&quot; to take in Danish and we find personages named &quot;Rorik&quot; or &quot;Hrok&quot; or similar in most version of the Hrólf Kraki tradition, but differently accounted for, seemingly indicating that Scandinavian tradition had forgotten who exactly &quot;Hreðric&quot;/&quot;Rorik&quot;/&quot;Hrok&quot; was and various story tellers subsequently invented details to explain references to this personage in older poems. The future slaying of Hreðric may be the occasion of the future burning of the hall of Heorot in the beginning of the poem – though some take it instead to refer to the legendary death of Hrólf Kraki, who in Icelandic sources is said to have died in the burning of his hall by his brother-in-law Hjörvard.

===Beowulf and Bjarki===
The standard view is that, if Beowulf himself has a &#x27;cognate&#x27; character in Rolf Kraki&#x27;s story, it is Bödvar Bjarki (Bodvar Biarke), who also has a younger companion, Hjalti (Hialte) – perhaps matching the Beowulf character Wiglaf. Beowulf comes from Geatland (= Götaland) and one of Bödvar Bjarki&#x27;s elder brothers, Thorir, becomes a king of Götaland. Moreover, like Beowulf, Bödvar Bjarki arrives in Denmark from Götaland (Geatland), and upon arriving in Denmark he kills a beast that has been ravaging the Danish court for two years. The monster in &quot;Hrólf Kraki&quot;&#x27;s saga, however, is quite unlike the Grendel of &quot;Beowulf&quot;; but it does have characteristics of a more typical dragon, a creature which appears later in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.
Just as Beowulf and Wiglaf slay a dragon at the end of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Bödvar Bjarki and Hjalti help each other slay the creature in Denmark.

Proponents of this theory, like J. R. R. Tolkien, argue that both the names &quot;Beowulf&quot; (lit. &quot;bee-wolf&quot;, a kenning for &quot;bear&quot;) and &quot;Bjarki&quot; are associated with bears. Bodvar Bjarki is constantly associated with bears, his father actually being one.

In some of the Hrólf Kraki material, Bödvar Bjarki aids Adils in defeating Adils&#x27; uncle Áli, in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the hero Beowulf aids Eadgils in Eadgils&#x27; war against Onela. As far as this Swedish adventure is concerned, Beowulf and Bödvar Bjarki are one and the same. This match supports the hypothesis that the adventure with the dragon is also originally derived from the same story.

===Hrothgar and Hróar===
As for the king of the Danes, Hroðgar, he is identical to &quot;Hróar&quot; or &quot;Ro&quot;, the uncle of Hrólf Kraki who in other sources outside of &quot;Beowulf&quot; rules as a co-king with his brother Helgi. But in those sources it is &quot;Hróar&quot;/&quot;Hroðgar&quot; who dies before his brother or who departs to Northumberland to rule his wife&#x27;s kingdom leaving &quot;Helgi&quot;/&quot;Halga&quot; the sole rule of Denmark. In &quot;Beowulf&quot; Halga/Helgi has died and Hroðgar is the primary ruler with Hroðulf son of Halga as a junior co-ruler.

Furthermore, the Swedish kings referenced in Beowulf are adequately matched with the 5th and 6th century Swedish kings in Uppsala (see also Swedish semi-legendary kings):
This has obviously nothing to do with a common origin of the Beowulf and Hrólf Kraki legends in particular but simply reflects a shared genealogical tradition.

==&quot;Widsith&quot;==
The poem &quot;Widsith&quot; also mentions Hroðgar and Hroðulf, but indicates that the feud with Ingeld did not end until the latter was defeated at Heorot:

This piece suggests that the conflict between the Scyldings Hroðgar and Hroðulf on one side, and the Heaðobards Froda and Ingeld on the other, was well known in Anglo-Saxon England. This conflict also appears in Scandinavian sources, but in the Norse tradition the Heaðobards had apparently been forgotten and the conflict is instead rendered as a family feud (see &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; and &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;).

==&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;==

The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the included &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; tell that Haldan (Healfdene) had two sons, Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hroðgar). When Haldan died of old age, Helghe and Ro divided the kingdom so that Ro ruled the land, and Helghe the sea. One day, Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro&#x27;s farmers. This resulted in a daughter named Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf. Eventually, Helghe found out that Yrse was his own daughter and, out of shame, went east and killed himself.

Both Helghe and Ro being dead, a Swedish king, called Hakon in the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; proper, and &quot;Athisl&quot; in the &quot;Annales&quot; – corresponding to Eadgils – forced the Danes to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Rolf Krage.

Rolf Krage was a big man in body and soul and was so generous that no one asked him for anything twice. His sister Skulda was married against Rolf&#x27;s will to Hartwar or Hiarwarth (Heoroweard), a German earl of Skåne, but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden.

This Hartwar arrived in Zealand with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed Rolf together with all his men. Only one survived, Wigg, who played along until he was to do homage to Hartwar. Then, he pierced Hartwar with a sword, and so Hartwar was king for only one morning.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
The Book 2 of the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus contains roughly the same information as the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;, i.e. that Ro (Hroðgar) and Helgo (Halga) were the son of Haldanus (Healfdene). When Haldanus died of old age, Ro took the land and Helgo the water. One day during his sea roving, Helgo arrived at Thurø, where he found and raped the young girl Thora, which resulted in Urse (Yrsa). When Helgo after many years returned to Thurø, Thora avenged her lost virginity by sending Urse to Helgo who, unknowingly raped his own daughter. This resulted in Roluo, who was a gifted man, both physically and intellectually and as brave as he was tall. After some time Helgo repelled a Swedish invasion, avenged Ro by killing the Swedish king Hothbrodd, and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he committed suicide due to shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse. Roluo succeeded him.

The new king of Sweden, Athislus (Eadgils), thought that the tribute to the Daner might be smaller if he married the Danish king&#x27;s mother and so took Urse for a queen. However, after some time, Urse was so upset with the Swedish king&#x27;s greed that she thought out a ruse to run away from the king and at the same time liberate him of his wealth. She incited Athislus to rebel against Roluo, and arranged so that Roluo would be invited and promised a wealth in gifts.

At the banquet Roluo was at first not recognised by his mother, but when their fondness was commented on by Athisl, the Swedish king and Roluo made a wager where Roluo would prove his endurance. Roluo was placed in front of a fire that exposed him to such heat that finally a maiden could suffer the sight no more and extinguished the fire. Roluo was greatly recompensed by Athisl for his endurance.

When the banquet had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, early in the morning in carriages where they had put all the Swedish king&#x27;s treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as &quot;sowing the Fyrisvellir&quot;), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he bent down to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother.

A young man named Wigg was impressed with Roluo&#x27;s bodily size and gave him the cognomen &quot;Krage&quot;, which meant a tall tree trunk used as a ladder. Roluo liked this name and rewarded Wigg with a heavy bracelet. Wigg, then, swore to Roluo to avenge him, if he was killed.

Roluo later defeated Athislus and gave Sweden to young man named Hiartuar (Heoroweard), who also married Roluo&#x27;s sister Skulde. Skulde, however, did not like the fact that her husband had to pay taxes to Roluo and so incited Hiartuar to rebel against him. They so went to Lejre (a town which Roluo had built) with arms hidden in the ships, under the pretense that they wanted to pay tribute.

They were well-received, but after the banquet, when most people were drunk asleep, the Swedes and the Goths (i.e. the Geats) proceeded to kill everyone at Roluo&#x27;s residence. After a long battle, involving Roluo&#x27;s champion Bjarki, who fought in the shape of a spirit bear until he was awakened by his comrade Hjalti, the Geats won and Roluo was killed.

Hiartuar asked Wigg if he wanted to fight for him, and Wigg said yes. Hiartuar wanted to give Wigg a sword, but he insisted on receiving it by taking the hilt. Having the hilt in his hand, Wigg pierced Hiartuar with the sword and so avenged Roluo. Swedes and Geats then rushed forward and killed Wigg. The Swedish king Høtherus (based on the god Höðr), the brother of Athislus, succeeded Roluo and became the king of a combined Sweden and Denmark.
==&quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;==
In &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, Halfdan (Healfdene) had three children, the sons Helgi (Halga) and Hróarr (Hroðgar) and the daughter Signý. The sister was the eldest and married to Sævil Jarl, with whom she had the son Hrókr. Halfdan was murdered by his own brother Fróði (Froda) and the two brothers had to seek refuge with a man called Vivil on an island, until they could avenge their father and kill Fróði.

Whereas Hróarr moved to Northumbria and married the king&#x27;s daughter, Helgi (i.e. Halga) went to the Saxons wanting to woo their warlike queen Oluf. She was, however, not interested and humiliated Helgi by shaving his head and covering him with tar, while he was asleep, and sending him back to his ship. Some time later, Helgi returned and through a ruse, he kidnapped the queen for a while during which time he made her pregnant.

Having returned to her kingdom, the queen bore a child, a girl which she named Yrsa after her dog. Yrsa was set to live as a shepherd, until she was 12 years old, when she met her father Helgi who fell in love with her, not knowing it was his daughter. Oluf kept quiet about the parentage and saw it as her revenge that Helgi would wed his own daughter. Helgi and Yrsa had the son Hrólfr.

Learning that Helgi and Yrsa lived happily together, queen Oluf travelled to Denmark to tell her daughter the truth. Yrsa was shocked and although Helgi wanted their relationship to remain as it was, Yrsa insisted on leaving him to live alone. She was later taken by the Swedish king Aðils (Eadgils) as his queen, which made Helgi even more unhappy. Helgi went to Uppsala to fetch her, but was killed by Aðils in battle. In Lejre, he was succeeded by his son Hrólfr.

Hrólfr soon assembled twelve great berserkers named Hrómundr harði, Hrólfr skjóthendi, Svipdagr, Beigaðr, Hvítserkr inn hvati, Haklangr, Harðrefill, Haki inn frækni, Vöttr inn mikilaflaði, Starólfr, Hjalti inn hugprúði and Bödvar Bjarki.

After some time, Bödvar Bjarki encouraged Hrólfr to go Uppsala to claim the gold that Aðils had taken from Helgi after the battle. Hrólfr departed with 120 men and his twelve berserkers and during a rest they were tested by a farmer called Hrani (Odin in disguise) who advised Hrólfr to send back all his troops but his twelve berserkers, as numbers would not help him against Aðils.

They were at first well received, but in his hall, Aðils did his best to stop Hrólfr with pit traps and hidden warriors who attacked the Danes. Finally Aðils entertained them but put them to a test where they had to endure immense heat by a fire. Hrólfr and his berserkers finally had enough and threw the courtiers, who were feeding the fire, into the fire and leapt at Aðils. The Swedish king disappeared through a hollow tree trunk that stood in his hall.

Yrsa admonished Aðils for wanting to kill her son, and went to meet the Danes. She gave them a man named Vöggr to entertain them. This Vöggr remarked that Hrólfr had the thin face of a pole ladder, a &quot;Kraki&quot;. Happy with his new cognomen Hrólfr gave Vöggr a golden ring, and Vöggr swore to avenge Hrólfr if anyone should kill him. Hrólfr and his company were then attacked by a troll in the shape of a boar in the service of Aðils, but Hrólfr&#x27;s dog Gram killed it.

They then found out that Aðils had set the hall on fire, and so they broke out of the hall, only to find themselves surrounded by heavily armed warriors in the street. After a fight, king Aðils retreated to summon reinforcements.

Yrsa then provided her son with a silver drinking horn filled with gold and jewels and a famous ring, Svíagris. Then she gave Hrólf and his men twelve of the Swedish king&#x27;s best horses, and all the armour and provisions they needed.

Hrólfr took a fond farewell of his mother and departed over the Fyrisvellir. When they saw Aðils and his warriors in pursuit, they spread the gold behind themselves. Aðils saw his precious Svíagris on the ground and stooped to pick it up with his spear, whereupon Hrólf cut his back with his sword and screamed in triumph that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden.

Hrólfr lived in peace for some time. However, his half-elven half-sister Skuld was married to Hjörvarðr (Heoroweard) one of Hrólfr&#x27;s subkings, and she began to turn her husband against Hrólfr. Under the pretext that they would wait three years before paying the accumulated tribute at one time, Skuld assembled a large army which included strong warriors, criminals, elves and norns. She used seiðr (witchcraft) to hide the great muster from Hrólfr and his champions.

They then arrived at Lejre one yule for the midwinter celebrations, with all the weapons hidden in wagons. A fight started and like in the account found in Gesta Danorum, Bödvar Bjarki fought in the shape of a spirit bear until he was awakened by Hjalti. Skuld used her witchcraft to resuscitate her fallen warriors and after a long fight Hrólfr and all his berserkers fell.

Skuld became the ruler of Denmark but did not rule well. Bödvar Bjarki&#x27;s brothers Elk-Froði and Þorir Houndsfoot went to Denmark to avenge their brother. The Swedish queen Yrsa gave them a large Swedish army headed by Vöggr. They captured Skuld before she could use her magic and tortured her to death. Then they raised a mound for Hrólfr Kraki where he was buried together with his sword Skofnung.

==&quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;==

The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; relates that Helgo (Halga) was the king of Denmark together with his brother Roas (Hroðgar). Helgo raped Olava, the queen of the Saxons, and she bore a daughter named Yrsa. The girl later married king Adillus (Eadgils), the king of Sweden, with whom she had the daughter Scullda.

Some years later, Helgo attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa, not knowing that she was his own daughter. He raped her and took her back to Denmark, where she bore the son &quot;Rolfo&quot;. After a few years, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, queen Olava, came to visit her and told her that Helgo was her own father. In horror, Yrsa returned to Adillus, leaving her son behind. Helgo died when Rolfo was eight years old, and Rolfo succeeded him, and ruled together with his uncle Roas. Not much later, Roas was killed by his half-brothers Rærecus and Frodo, whereupon Rolfo became the sole king of Denmark.

In Sweden, Yrsa and Adillus married Scullda to the king of Öland, Hiørvardus (also called &quot;Hiorvardus&quot; and &quot;Hevardus&quot;, and who corresponds to Heoroweard in &quot;Beowulf&quot;). As her half-brother Rolfo was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked Öland and made Hiørvardus and his kingdom tributary to Denmark.

After some time Adillus requested Rolfo&#x27;s aid against king Ale (Onela) of Oppland, and Rolfo sent him his berserkers. Adillus then won the war, but refused to pay the expected tribute for the help and so Rolfo came to Uppsala to claim his recompense. After surviving some traps, Rolfo fled with Adillus&#x27; gold, helped by his mother Yrsa, and &quot;sowed&quot; it on the Fyrisvellir.

Hiørvardus and his queen Skullda rebelled against Rolfo and killed him. However, Hiørvardus did not live long after this and was killed. Rolfo was succeeded by his father&#x27;s cousin Rörek, who, however, had to leave Skåne to Valdar and could only keep Zealand.

==&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;==

In the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; by Snorri Sturluson, the story of Hrólfr Kraki is presented in order to explain why gold was known by the kenning &quot;Kraki&#x27;s seed&quot;.

Snorri relates that &quot;Hrólfr&quot; was the most renowned king in Denmark for valour, generosity and graciousness. One day a poor boy called Vöggr arrived and expressed his surprise that such a great king would look like a little pole (kraki). Hrólfr said that Vöggr had given him a name and gave Vöggr a golden ring in recompense. In gratitude Vöggr swore to Hrólfr to avenge him, should he be killed.

A second tale was when the king of Sweden, Aðils (Eadgils), was in war with a Norwegian king named Áli (Onela), and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Aðils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hrólfr and so sent an embassy to Hrólfr asking him for help against Áli. He would receive three valuable gifts in recompense. Hrólfr was involved in a war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers. Áli died in the war, and Aðils took Áli&#x27;s helmet &quot;Battle-boar&quot; and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that Aðils had promised Hrólfr, that is the two pieces of armour that nothing could pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat &quot;Finn&#x27;s heritage&quot;. They also wanted the famous ring Svíagris. Aðils considered the pay outrageous and refused.

When Hrólfr heard that Aðils refused to pay, he set off to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode directly to the Swedish king&#x27;s hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their bodies. Hrólfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Svíagris and asked them to flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw Aðils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw their gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect the gold. Aðils, however, continued the chase on his horse Slöngvir. Hrólfr then threw Svíagris and saw how Aðils stooped down to pick up the ring with his spear. Hrólfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back.

==&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;==
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; was used by Snorri Sturluson as a source when he told the story of Aðils (Eadgils) and Yrsa, in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, a part of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. What remains of the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; is a Latin summary by Arngrímur Jónsson, and so the two versions are basically the same, the main difference being that Arngrímur&#x27;s version is more terse.

Snorri relates that Aðils betook himself to pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geirþjófr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort were not at home, and so Aðils and his men plundered their residence at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships. One of the captives was a remarkably beautiful girl named Yrsa, and Snorri writes that everyone was soon impressed with the well-mannered, pretty and intelligent girl. Most impressed was Aðils who made her his queen.

Some years later, Helgi (Halga), who ruled in Lejre, attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa. He raped Yrsa, his own daughter, and took her back to Lejre, where they had a son, Hrólfr. When the boy was three years of age, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, queen Alof of Saxony, came to visit her and told her that her husband Helgi was her own father. Horrified, Yrsa returned to Aðils, leaving her son behind, and stayed in Sweden for the rest of her life. When Hrólfr was eight years old, Helgi died during a war expedition and Hrólf was proclaimed king.

Snorri finishes his account by briefly mentioning that the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; contained an extensive account of how Hrólf came to Uppsala and sowed gold on the Fyrisvellir.

==&quot;Gróttasöngr&quot;==
 The &quot;Gróttasöngr&quot; contains a stanza (nr 22) sung by the giantesses Fenja and Menja. It only names Yrsa and the situation that her son and brother (i.e. Hroðulf) will avenge Fródi (Froda):
This piece cannot refer to &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; where Froda was the half-brother of Healfdene because this Froda was killed by Hroðgar (and therefore they avenged him). It can, however, be interpreted through the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; in which Hroðulf&#x27;s uncle Hroðgar was murdered by his half-brother Froda.

Either Frodi&#x27;s death is the one they want to avenge, or they seek vengeance for Hroðgar, killed by his half brother. The Danish equivalent of &quot;hefna&quot; is &quot;at hævne&quot;, meaning revenge (or avenging), in this case for Fródi&#x27;s murder, indicating no relation to Hroðgars death, but to Frodi&#x27;s. &#x27;Kin&#x27; and &#x27;kinsmen&#x27; share a certain reference to blood relation, yet &#x27;brother&#x27; can also have the meaning of either: &#x27;one of us&#x27; and &#x27;our tribesmen&#x27;, or simply &#x27;son and brother&#x27;. After being recognized for his deeds, Yrsa will see Hroðulf as her son once more.

==&quot;Gautreks saga&quot;==
Hrólfr Kraki is mentioned briefly in &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;, written around 1300, when the adventurer Ref comes to him with a gift consisting of two dogs. In return for this gift Hrólfr gives him a helmet and a chainmail, both made of red gold.

== Modern references ==
Danish playwright Johannes Ewald wrote a play about &quot;Rolf Krage&quot; (1770), based on Saxo&#x27;s version of the story in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger wrote a poem, &quot;Helge: et Digt&quot; (1814).

The American writer Poul Anderson used this story in his novel &quot;Hrolf Kraki&#x27;s Saga&quot; (1973). Anderson&#x27;s story begins in earlier generations and more or less follows the version in &quot;Hrolfr Kraki&#x27;s Saga&quot; described above. The book was well received by many fantasy fans.

&quot;Sellic Spell&#x27;, a fictionalized treatment of the story by J. R. R. Tolkien, was published in &quot;Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary&quot; on May 22, 2014, Tolkien himself explaining that his was &quot;a limited...attempt to reconstruct the Anglo-Saxon tale that lies behind the folk-tale element in &quot;Beowulf&quot;&quot;.

The Danish Navy&#x27;s first ironclad warship was named &quot;Rolf Krake&quot;.

In the 2022 video game &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;, Hrólfr is featured as a malevolent ghostly berserker and the final opponent in a series of side-quests involving him and his twelve lieutenants.

<text>Derek William Bentley (30 June 1933 – 28 January 1953) was a British man who was hanged for the murder of a policeman during a burglary. Christopher Craig, then aged 16, a friend and accomplice of Bentley, was accused of the murder. Bentley was convicted as a party to the crime under the English law principle of joint enterprise, as the burglary had been committed in mutual understanding and bringing deadly weapons. The outcome of the trial, and Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe&#x27;s failure to grant clemency to Bentley, were highly controversial.

The jury at the trial found Bentley guilty based in large part on the prosecution&#x27;s interpretation of the ambiguous phrase &quot;Let him have it&quot;, Bentley&#x27;s alleged exhortation to Craig, which prosecutors argued was an order to shoot and defence counsel argued was an order to surrender; this after Lord Chief Justice Goddard had described Bentley as &quot;mentally aiding&quot; the murder. Goddard sentenced Bentley to be hanged, despite a recommendation for mercy by the jury.

The Bentley case became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and led to a 40-year-long campaign to win Bentley a posthumous pardon, which was granted in 1993, and then a further campaign for the quashing of his murder conviction, which occurred in 1998. Bentley&#x27;s case is thus considered a case of miscarriage of justice alongside that of Timothy Evans, and pivotal in the successful campaign to abolish capital punishment in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Derek Bentley entered Norbury Manor Secondary Modern School in 1944, after failing the eleven-plus examination. Just before leaving, in March 1948, he and another boy were arrested for theft. Six months later, Bentley was sentenced to serve three years at Kingswood Approved School near Bristol. Christopher Craig also attended the same Secondary Modern school.

==Health and mental development==
Bentley had a series of health problems. His parents reported that in a childhood accident he had broken his nose and since then he had three seizure fits, including one in which they said he nearly died of choking. The family also said they were bombed out three times during the Second World War, and in one of these incidents the house in which he lived collapsed around him, but a court did not find any indication that he was physically injured in the incident. However, Bentley was later seen to have epilepsy.

Bentley was sent to Kingswood Training School, Bristol, on 27 October 1948. There he was administered diagnostic tests which eventually determined, when he was years old, that his mental age was estimated at ten years, four months, while he had scored 66 on an IQ test. Kingswood staff reported Bentley to be &quot;lazy, indifferent, voluble and of the &#x27;wise guy&#x27; type&quot;, whilst a court described him as &quot;indifferent, smug, self-satisfied and ready to tell tales&quot;. After his arrest in November 1952, further IQ tests were administered to him at Brixton Prison. He was described there as &quot;borderline feeble-minded&quot;, with a verbal score of 71, a performance IQ of 87 and a full scale IQ of 77. Bentley was discovered to still be &quot;quite illiterate&quot; at the time of his arrest in November 1952. The prison medical officer said he &quot;cannot even recognise or write down all the letters of the alphabet&quot;. 

Bentley was examined twice by EEG: a reading on 16 November 1949 indicated he was an epileptic and a reading on 9 February 1950 was &quot;abnormal&quot;.

==Release from Kingswood==
Bentley was released from Kingswood school on 28 July 1950, a year early, though he was told that he would remain under the care of Kingswood until 29 September 1954, by which time he was dead. He was a recluse for the rest of 1950, rarely venturing out of the house, breaking his isolation in January 1951. 

In March 1951, he was employed by a furniture removal firm but was forced to leave the job after injuring his back in March 1952. In May 1952, Bentley was taken on by the Croydon Corporation as a dustbin man; one month later, in June 1952 he was demoted to street sweeping for unsatisfactory performance. One month after that, he was sacked by the corporation. He was still unemployed at the time of his arrest in November 1952.

==Crime==
On the night of Sunday, 2 November 1952, Bentley and a 16-year-old companion, Christopher Craig, broke into the warehouse of the Barlow &amp; Parker confectionery company at 27–29 Tamworth Road, Croydon. Craig armed himself with a Colt New Service .455 Webley calibre revolver, the barrel of which he had shortened so that it could be carried easily in his pocket. He also carried a number of undersized rounds for the revolver, some of which he had modified by hand to fit the gun. Bentley carried a knuckle-duster, which he had been given by Craig, who had been fined the previous year for possessing a firearm without a certificate.

At around 9:15pm, neighbours called police after spotting Craig and Bentley climbing over the gate and up a drainpipe to the roof of the warehouse.
When police arrived, Craig and Bentley hid behind the lift-housing. Craig taunted the police. One of the officers, Detective Constable Frederick Fairfax, climbed the drainpipe to the roof and grabbed hold of Bentley, but Bentley broke free. What happened then is uncertain: police witnesses later claimed that Fairfax ordered Craig to &quot;Hand over the gun, lad&quot; and Bentley shouted, &quot;Let him have it, Chris&quot;. Craig fired, striking Fairfax in the shoulder. Fairfax was nonetheless again able to restrain Bentley, who told Fairfax that Craig had further ammunition for the gun. Bentley had not used either of the weapons in his pockets.

A group of uniformed police officers arrived and were sent onto the roof. The first to reach the roof was Police Constable Sidney Miles, who was immediately killed by a shot to the head. After exhausting his ammunition and being cornered, Craig jumped 30 feet (10 metres) from the roof onto a greenhouse, fracturing his spine and left wrist, and had to remain in hospital.

==Trial==
Both Craig and Bentley were charged with the murder of PC Miles the following day. The doctrine of felony murder or &quot;constructive malice&quot; meant that a charge of manslaughter was not an option, as the &quot;malicious intent&quot; of the armed robbery was transferred to the shooting. They were tried by jury before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard, at the Old Bailey in London between 9 December and 11 December 1952. Christmas Humphreys, Senior Treasury Counsel, led for the prosecution.

At the time of the burglary and Miles&#x27; death, murder was a capital offence in England and Wales. The Children and Young Persons Act 1933 prevented execution of those under 18; consequently, of the two defendants, despite Craig having fired the fatal shot, only Bentley faced the death penalty if convicted. Bentley&#x27;s best defence was that he was effectively under arrest when Miles was killed. There were three principal points of contention at trial:

Firstly, the defence claimed there was ambiguity in the evidence as to how many shots were fired and by whom. A later forensic ballistics expert cast doubt on whether Craig could have hit Miles if he had shot at him deliberately. The fatal bullet was not found. Craig had used bullets of different undersized calibres, and the sawn-off barrel made it inaccurate to a degree of six feet at the range from which he fired.

Secondly, there was controversy over the existence and meaning of Bentley&#x27;s alleged instruction to Craig, &quot;let him have it, Chris&quot;. Craig and Bentley denied that Bentley had said the words while the police officers testified that he had said them. Further, Bentley&#x27;s counsel argued that even if he had said the words, it could not be proven that Bentley had intended the words to mean the informal meaning of &quot;shoot him, Chris&quot; instead of the literal meaning of &quot;give him the gun, Chris&quot;.

Thirdly, there was disagreement over whether Bentley was fit to stand trial in light of his mental capacity. The Principal Medical Officer responsible was Dr Matheson and he referred Bentley to Dr Hill, a psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital. Hill&#x27;s report stated that Bentley was illiterate and of low intelligence, what today would be described as having learning difficulties. However, Matheson was of the opinion that whilst agreeing that Bentley was of low intelligence, he did not have epilepsy at the time of the alleged offence and he was not a &quot;feeble-minded person&quot; under the Mental Deficiency Acts. Matheson said that he was sane and fit to plead and stand trial. English law at the time did not recognise the concept of diminished responsibility due to retarded development, though it existed in Scottish law (it was introduced to England by the Homicide Act 1957). Criminal insanity – where the accused is unable to distinguish right from wrong – was then the only medical defence to murder. Bentley, while he had a severe debilitation, was not insane.

The jury took 75 minutes to decide that both Craig and Bentley were guilty of Miles&#x27; murder, with a plea for mercy for Bentley. Bentley was sentenced to death whilst Craig was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty&#x27;s Pleasure. He was eventually released in May 1963 after serving 10 years&#x27; imprisonment, married two years later and subsequently became a plumber.

Bentley was originally scheduled to be hanged on 30 December 1952, but this was postponed to allow for an appeal. Bentley&#x27;s lawyers filed appeals highlighting the ambiguities of the ballistic evidence, Bentley&#x27;s mental age and the fact that he did not fire the fatal shot. Bentley&#x27;s appeal was heard on 13 January 1953 and was unsuccessful.

===Denial of reprieve===
When his appeal was turned down, Bentley&#x27;s life was placed in the hands of the Home Secretary, David Maxwell Fyfe, who had to decide whether to recommend that the Crown exercise the royal prerogative of mercy to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment. Lord Goddard forwarded the jury&#x27;s recommendation of mercy, but added that he himself &quot;could find no mitigating circumstances&quot;. His later statements to author David Yallop convinced Yallop that Goddard had wanted a reprieve.

Maxwell Fyfe&#x27;s autobiography, published in 1964, refers to the factors which he took into consideration: &quot;the evidence of the trial, medical reports, family or other private circumstances ... and police reports, ... the available precedents, and ... public opinion&quot;. He went on to say that Bentley&#x27;s case also involved the issue of the police force, since it was a police officer who was killed. Maxwell Fyfe then stresses that a reprieve would mean the Home Secretary is &quot;intervening in the due process of the law&quot;. 

There was much political pressure to commute Bentley&#x27;s sentence, including a memorandum signed by over 200 members of Parliament. Despite several attempts, Parliament was given no opportunity to debate the issue until the sentence had been carried out. The Home Office also refused Dr Hill permission to make his report public.

At 9am on 28 January 1953, Bentley was hanged at Wandsworth Prison, London, by Albert Pierrepoint, with Harry Allen assisting. There were protests outside the prison and two people were arrested and fined for damage to property.

In March 1966, Bentley&#x27;s remains were removed from Wandsworth and re-interred in Croydon Cemetery.

==&quot;To Encourage the Others&quot;==
In his 1971 book &quot;To Encourage the Others&quot; (the title is an acknowledged allusion to Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;), David Yallop documented Bentley&#x27;s psychiatric problems, as well as what he believed were inconsistencies in the police and forensic evidence and the conduct of the trial. Despite Craig&#x27;s gun being the only one on the roof at the moment that Miles was shot, he proposed the theory that Miles was actually killed by a bullet from a gun other than Craig&#x27;s sawn-off .455 revolver. Yallop drew this conclusion from an interview in March 1971 with David Haler, the pathologist who carried out the autopsy on Miles, who Yallop reports estimated the head wound was inflicted by a bullet of between .32 and .38 calibre fired from between six and nine feet away. Craig had been firing from a distance of just under 40 feet and had used a variety of undersized .41, and .45 calibre rounds in his revolver; Yallop asserted it would have been impossible for him to use a bullet of .38 or smaller calibre. Haler did not offer in his trial evidence any estimate of the size of the bullet that had killed Miles. In July 1970, during an interview with Yallop, Craig accepted that the bullet that killed Miles came from his gun, but maintained that all of his shots were fired over the rear garden of a house adjacent to the warehouse, approximately 20 degrees to the right of Miles&#x27; location from where Craig had been firing.

The standard Metropolitan Police pistol at the time was the .32-calibre Webley automatic, a number of which were issued on the night. In his book &quot;The Scientific Investigation of Crime&quot;, the prosecution&#x27;s ballistics expert Lewis Nickolls stated that he recovered four bullets from the roof, two of .45, one of .41 and one of .32 calibre. The last was not entered as an exhibit in the trial, nor mentioned in Nickolls&#x27; evidence to the court.

When Yallop telephoned Haler the day after the initial interview, he reportedly confirmed his estimate of the bullet size. Shortly before the publication of Yallop&#x27;s book, Haler was provided with a transcript of the interview, and Yallop says Haler again confirmed as accurate. After the subsequent broadcast of the BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot; adaptation of &quot;To Encourage the Others&quot;, directed by Alan Clarke and starring Charles Bolton, Haler sought to deny that he had given any specific estimate of the size of the bullet that killed Miles beyond being &quot;of large calibre&quot;. The .32 ACP bullet is not considered to be of large calibre.

Contrary to Yallop&#x27;s claims, none of the police officers present was armed at the moment when PC Miles was shot. Det Con (later Det Sgt) Fairfax, after Miles was shot and after taking Bentley to street level and putting him into a police car, returned to the roof armed with a Webley &amp; Scott .32 and fired two shots at Craig, both of which missed. Since a .32 round could not be loaded into Craig&#x27;s revolver and Craig was the only armed person in the vicinity at the time of the murder, the spent .32 round could only be one of Fairfax&#x27;s, fired some time subsequently. As the Court of Appeal found, &#x27;Once the appellant [Bentley] had been taken down, D.C. Fairfax returned with a firearm, with which he had been issued, and went back up to the roof. He fired twice at Craig but missed, Craig having fired at him. Craig&#x27;s revolver was by now empty and he jumped or dived off the roof, suffering a fractured spine, breast bone and left forearm. Notwithstanding this, he was able to tell the first police officer who reached him that he wished he had &quot;killed the fucking lot&quot;. He later made a number of statements to police officers sitting with him in hospital, displaying a hatred of the police and a total lack of remorse at what he had done.&#x27;

==Posthumous pardon and appeal==
Following the execution there was a public sense of unease about the decision, resulting in a long campaign to secure a posthumous pardon. The campaign was initially led by Bentley&#x27;s parents until their deaths in the 1970s, after which the drive to clear Bentley&#x27;s name was led by his sister Iris. In March 1966 his remains were removed from Wandsworth Prison and reburied in a family grave. On 29 July 1993, Bentley was granted a royal pardon in respect of the sentence of death passed upon him and carried out. However, in English law this did not quash his conviction for murder.

Eventually, on 30 July 1998, the Court of Appeal quashed Bentley&#x27;s conviction for murder. However, Bentley&#x27;s sister Iris had died of cancer the year before. Her daughter, Maria Bentley-Dingwall, who was born 10 years after Derek Bentley&#x27;s execution, continued the campaign after her mother&#x27;s death.

Christopher Craig, by then aged 62 (born May 1936), issued a statement welcoming the pardon for Bentley, stating that &quot;his innocence has now been proved&quot;. He also apologised to the families of both PC Miles and Bentley for his actions, as well as his own family for the press intrusion they had suffered over the years.

Though Bentley had never been accused of attacking any of the police officers, who were shot at by Craig, for him to be convicted of murder as an accessory in a joint enterprise it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that he knew that Craig had a deadly weapon when they began the break-in. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, ruled that Lord Goddard had not made it clear to the jury that the prosecution was required to have proved Bentley had known that Craig was armed. He further ruled that Lord Goddard had failed to raise the question of Bentley&#x27;s withdrawal from their joint enterprise. This would require the prosecution to prove the absence of any attempt by Bentley to signal to Craig that he wanted Craig to surrender his weapons to the police. Lord Bingham ruled that Bentley&#x27;s trial had been unfair because the judge had misdirected the jury and, in his summing-up, had put unfair pressure on the jury to convict. It is possible that Lord Goddard may have been under pressure while summing up since much of the evidence was not directly relevant to Bentley&#x27;s defence. Lord Bingham did not rule that Bentley was innocent, merely that there had been fundamental defects in the trial process.

Another factor in the posthumous defence was that a &quot;confession&quot; recorded by Bentley, which was claimed by the prosecution to be a &quot;verbatim record of dictated monologue&quot;, was shown by forensic linguistics methods to have been largely edited by policemen. Linguist Malcolm Coulthard showed that certain patterns, such as the frequency of the word &quot;then&quot; and the grammatical use of &quot;then&quot; after the grammatical subject (&quot;I then&quot; rather than &quot;then I&quot;), were not consistent with Bentley&#x27;s use of language (his idiolect), as evidenced in court testimony. These patterns fit better the recorded testimony of the policemen involved. This is one of the earliest uses of forensic linguistics on record.

==In popular culture==
A play &quot;Example&quot;,was devised by the Coventry Belgrade Theatre in Education Team for fifth and sixth form students and toured Coventry schools in 1975. The play, with an introduction by Miller, who played Bentley, was included in a 1980 book &quot;Theatre in Education – Four Secondary School Programmes&quot;, published by Methuen, edited by Pam Schweitzer.

The 1990 book &quot;Let Him Have It, Chris&quot; written by M. J. Trow explores the inconsistencies in the police version of events.

The 1991 feature film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot;, starring Christopher Eccleston as Bentley and Paul Reynolds as Craig, relates the story, as do the songs &quot;Derek Bentley&quot; by Karl Dallas (in which the lyrics imply that Bentley was guilty but sympathise with him), &quot;Let Him Dangle&quot; by Elvis Costello, &quot;Let Him Have It&quot; by The Bureau, and &quot;Bentley and Craig&quot; by Ralph McTell, whose mother was a friend of the Bentley family, also covered by June Tabor (on Aleyn, TSCD490, 1997).

In the 2013 novel &quot;The Late Scholar&quot; by Jill Paton Walsh, the character Peter Wimsey notes that the Bentley case has reduced the support for capital punishment.

<text>Ideas is a long-running scholarly radio documentary series on CBC Radio One, first broadcast in 1965. it has been hosted by Nahlah Ayed and is broadcast between 8:05 and 9:00 p.m. weekday evenings; one episode each week is repeated on Monday afternoons under the title &quot;Ideas in the Afternoon&quot;. The CBC Ideas podcast series initiative began in 2005.

==Background==
Co-created by Phyllis Webb and William A. Young, the premiere broadcast of the hour-long daily program, &quot;The Best Ideas You&#x27;ll Hear Tonight&quot;, aired on CBC Radio on October 25, 1965, and featured a &quot;series on Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by Dr. June Clare, a British biochemist&quot;. &quot;The Best Ideas&quot; was a &quot;series of talks, discussions and commentaries for &#x27;people who just enjoy thinking.&#x27;&quot; Two programs, &quot;The Learning Stage&quot; and &quot;University of the Air&quot; had merged because of budget cuts to create the &quot;Best Ideas&quot; first series.

A 1988 &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article said that the show described itself as a radio program on contemporary thought. The subject matter of the shows varies, but music, philosophy, science, religion, and history were common topics. By 1988, the show had won many plaudits for its quality and depth. 

According to a 1989, &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; article, the series was notable at that time, for soliciting programming proposals from people who are not professional broadcasters, and having the successful applicants write and host their own documentaries (aided in production by CBC staff producers). In the 1990s, the series was sometimes temporarily replaced in the summer season by &quot;Ideas in the Summer&quot;, a companion series by the same producers which specifically explored cultural and entertainment topics such as music, literature and art.

Many &quot;Ideas&quot; programs are multi-part, with two, three, four, or more fifty-five-minute programs devoted to a single topic. Transcripts and audio recordings of many programs are made available, and sold directly by the CBC.

In 2013, notable CBC staff producers who have been associated with the program included Bernie Lucht, Geraldine Sherman, Damiano Pietropaolo, Phyllis Webb, and David Cayley. Individual programs are produced at CBC Radio One facilities across Canada. Documentarian William Whitehead also wrote or cowrote a number of shows for &quot;Ideas&quot;.

A television version for CBC News Network, &quot;Ideas on TV&quot;, was short-lived. The book &quot;Ideas: Brilliant Thinkers Speak Their Minds&quot;, edited by Bernie Lucht, commemorated the series&#x27; 40th anniversary.

The show broadcasts Canada&#x27;s annual Massey Lectures, Lafontaine-Baldwin Lecture, and the Munk Debates. Since 2006, they have included the Henry G. Friesen lectures. Audio downloads of many episodes are available from the CBC website, as well as via the CBC Listen application.

On June 24, 2019 it was announced that Nahlah Ayed would be the new host of &quot;Ideas&quot;, taking over from the retiring Paul Kennedy in September. The CBC&#x27;s 2019 fall schedule also moved the program an hour earlier from its longtime 9 p.m. slot, and it will now be heard from 8 to 9 p.m. nightly.

==Podcast==
Ideas podcast, which was, by popular demand, one of the first to be included in the network&#x27;s large podcasting initiative begun in 2005.

===Roman Catholic===
When Witten was first mentioned in historical documents, it was part of the Archdiocese of Cologne. Since 1821 it has been a part of the Diocese of Paderborn; however, the borough of Herbede belongs to the Diocese of Essen. In the 19th century the Ruhr area drew up to 500,000 Poles from East Prussia and Silesia, most of whom were Catholic. Hundreds settled in Witten, leading to a growth in the Catholic community. Today, between 30 and 40 per cent of the population is Catholic.

===Protestant===
In the 16th century Witten was influenced by Martin Luther&#x27;s Reformation, and until the late 19th century, Witten was a predominantly Protestant town with just a few Catholic inhabitants. Between 30 and 40 per cent of the population is Protestant today.

===Muslims===
There are four mosques in Witten, Annen and Herbede today, founded by immigrants from Turkey who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s. Between five and eight per cent of the population is Muslim.

===Jews===

In 1815 the first Jewish community was mentioned in Witten. In 1938 the synagogue was destroyed during the so-called &quot;Reichspogromnacht&quot; (also known as &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;) of 9–10 November 1938. Today, only about a dozen Jews live in Witten. They belong to the Jewish community in Dortmund.

Since 1994 the place of the former synagogue is marked with a memorial.

<doc id="249828" wikidata="Q6237" url="?curid=249828" title="Lecco">
<text>Lecco (, , ; ) is a city of approximately 47,000 inhabitants in Lombardy, Northern Italy, north of Milan. It lies at the end of the south-eastern branch of Lake Como (the branch is named &quot;Branch of Lecco&quot; / &quot;Ramo di Lecco&quot;). The Bergamo Alps rise to the north and east, cut through by the Valsassina of which Lecco marks the southern end.

The lake, narrows to form the River Adda, so bridges were built to improve road communications with Como and Milan. There are four bridges crossing the river Adda in Lecco: the Azzone Visconti Bridge (1336–1338), the Kennedy Bridge (1956), the Alessandro Manzoni Bridge (1985), and a railroad bridge.

Lecco was also Alpine Town of the Year in 2013.

Lecco obtained the title of city on 22 June 1848, and was elevated to province by decree of the President of the Republic of 6 March 1992. 

Known for being the place where the writer Alessandro Manzoni set &quot;The Betrothed&quot;, the city is located in one of the vortices of the Larian Triangle. It overlooks the eastern branch of Lake Como and is included in the Orobic Prealps, between the Grigne mountain chain and the Resegone.

As strategic crossroads for Valtellina, Lecco assumed increasing importance during the Middle Ages when it was annexed to the Duchy of Milan following the Peace of Constance. During the second half of the 19th century, under the Austrian dominion, the city went through a particularly flourishing period during which palaces and arcades in neoclassical style were constructed. After the unification of Italy, Lecco established itself as one of the most important industrial centers of the nation thanks to the development of the steel industries, already active in the 12th century. For this reason, Lecco is also called &quot;the Iron city&quot;.

Lecco has a population of 46,831 inhabitants, as of 2021.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the toponym Lecco is not certain: it probably has a Celtic origin (Lech or Loch) words that mean lake. Shortly before the year 1000 B.C., some populations of Gauls and Celts migrated to the territory of Lecco for trade. &quot;Leucos&quot; was the name given by the Gauls who inhabited these areas until Romans transformed the denomination into Leucum under Julius Caesar’s domination around 200 B.C.; so the hypothesis put forward by historians who have identified in Lecco the Roman city founded in 95 b.C. by Licinius Crassus in the Larian area with the name of Leucera was excluded. 

==History==
=== Celtic and Roman periods ===
In 1988, excavations of the Civic Museums of Lecco led to the discovery of a village of the Culture of Golasecca (first Iron Age) at the Rocca di Chiuso. The settlement of the Golasecchiani Celts in the area precedes the arrival of the Celts by more than 4 centuries.

In 2005, other excavations of the Civic Museums of Lecco and the University of Bergamo unearthed the oldest metallurgical production site in the entire Alpine arc (2nd century B.C. – 1st century B.C.) at piani d&#x27;Erna.

=== The Middle Ages ===
As the nodal point of several streets that put Lombardy in communication with the territories of Oltralpe, the region becomes the scene of clashes and decisive battles. The fortified system of Lecco (Castrum Leuci) became the seat, with the Carolingian, of an important Committee entrusted to the Attonid family. In 960, Lecco was submitted to the lordship of the Archbishop of Milan. 

Throughout the Middle Ages and the Modern Age, the name of Lecco did not indicate an inhabited center but included the whole area between the lake and Valsassina. Lecco was a polycentric settlement, in which the various districts were closely interdependent, each with functional and economic specialization.

=== The Municipal and Viscount period ===
In 1117, a ten-year war broke out pitting many villages of the lakes of Como and Lugano against Milan, of which Lecco was an ally. The inhabitants of Lecco took part in the battle and in March 1125, Como had to capitulate and the victors set it on fire. 

Later, Lecco became involved in the struggles between the powerful Milanese families Visconti and Torriani (the owners of the Valsassina territories). In 1296, the struggles led Matthew I Visconti to destroy the village giving orders that it would never rise again. Despite the destruction, Lecco was rebuilt and reconquered by Azzone Visconti. Throughout the period the community of Lecco, which included the entire current municipal territory, evolved as a free municipality with its statutes and, until 1757, was de facto a small autonomous state (with its own civil and criminal law), but inserted in the largest Duchy of Milan.

=== Spanish domination ===
With the fall of the Duchy of Milan, Lecco passed to Spanish dominium and, under Charles V, was transformed into a military stronghold. In this period, it suffered, as all Milanese territory, from plagues and famines, which Manzoni admirably described in &quot;The Betrothed&quot;. In 1714, Lombardy passed to the control of Habsburgs of Austria.

=== Austrian domination ===
In 1784, Joseph II of Austria visited the city and decided to destroy the walls. With the descent of Napoleon and the birth of the Cisalpine Republic in 1797, the Riviera di Lecco is part of the ephemeral Mountain Department. In 1799, Russian and French troops fought here during the War of the Second Coalition. In 1814, after the final defeat of Napoleon, the Austrian army regained possession of the region and permanently brought Lecco back to the province of Como in 1816 (from which it will become independent only in 1995) and definitively divides the city into many small municipalities that will be re-established in 1923, during the Fascist 20th anniversary.

In the period of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Veneto, Lecco experienced positive effects: numerous interventions of modernization and development of the territory, such as the introduction of an efficient bureaucracy, the increase of the cadastre and industrial development that led to widespread well-being.

=== From Risorgimento to the post-war periods ===
In the 19th century, Lecco became one of the beating hearts of Italian culture: the Scapigliati, a famous group of Milanese writers made Maggianico one of their favorite meeting places. The cultural ferment of the period was also associated with political ferment, and Lecco and its inhabitants played a very important role in the Lombard Risorgimento.

When the Milanese insurrection against Austria started in March 1848, a priest, Don Antonio Mascari, incited rebellion from the pulpit, but the insurrection that took place on the night between 18th and March 19 was unsuccessful. By decree of 22 June 1848, the provisional government of Lombardy (the Austrian government had lapsed following the Five Days of Milan insurrection) promoted Lecco to the rank of City, thanks to the contribution that the city was making to the Cause of Risorgimento. However, Lecco was again downgraded to Borgo in 1859.

In 1859, with the Second War of Independence, Lecco and Lombardy were conquered by the Kingdom of Sardinia and, in the same year, it re-entered the title of City. 

In 1923, the municipal territory, which has now become insufficient to contain urban expansion, was greatly expanded with the aggregation of the neighboring municipalities of Acquate, Castello Sopra Lecco, Germanedo, Laorca, Rancio di Lecco and San Giovanni alla Castagna, as well as part of the municipal territory of Maggianico; in 1928, the remaining part of Maggianico was also aggregated.

== Climate ==
Lecco is the northernmost city (urban area) in Italy with a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; defined by Köppen), only slightly softer than Milan. Despite being in a parallel dominated by a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), the territory is well sheltered from the mountain ranges, and from the climatic point of view, enjoys the beneficial influences of the lake&#x27;s waters and the breath of the Tivano that blows from the Valtellina from the northeast all year round in the early hours of the morning. Its absence indicates bad weather. Breva is another wind that runs towards the lake, from the south to the north and indicator of good weather.

== Geography ==

«&quot;That branch of the Lake of Como, which turns toward the south between two unbroken chains of mountains, presenting to the eye a succession of bays and gulfs, formed by their jutting and retiring ridges, suddenly contracts itself between a headland to the right and an extended sloping bank on the left, and assumes the flow and appearance of a river.&quot;»

The municipal territory covers an area of about . It is located in a wide valley bordered by the Prealps to the east and Lake Lario to the west, at the point where Lake Lario ends and the Adda river resumes its course and then re-expands into Lake Garlate. The territory is crossed by three main streams: the Gerenzone, the Calderone and the Bione. The mountains that surround the natural, wide valley are: to the north Monte Coltignone and San Martino, to the east mount Due Mani, Pizzo d&#x27;Erna and Resegone, to the south the Magnodeno, to the west, on the right bank of the Adda River, is Mount Barro. On the Adda river, near the Azzone Visconti bridge, there is the small Viscontea Island.

The territory has a very variable altitude distribution: it ranges from above sea level in the lake area to the maximum altitude of above the sea level of Mount Resegone and this condition offers the city three different areas characterized by different morphologic and climatic characteristics.

The hydrography consists mainly of the stretch of the Adda river leaving the eastern branch of Lake Como and a series of streams, with their tributaries, which originate in the mountain range.

Lecco is delimited, to the north rises the massif of Monte Coltignone, mainly of limestone and dolomia of Esino, directly overlooking the lower peaks, such as Monte San Martino (Lecco), Monte Melma, and Monte Albano. To the east, the Resegone group, which, with its 1875 meters above the level of the sea, dominates the city characterizing the Lombard landscape up to Milan. Resegone is so named because of its multiple rocky teeth that, seen from the town, make it resemble a saw of gigantic size; Monte Serada dominates imposingly with its offshoots, which are the Piani d&#x27;Erna and the Pian Serada. To the southeast, beyond Maggianico, the greatest elevation is represented by the Magnodeno. To the west, there are the hills of north-eastern Brianza, among which stands out Mount Barro in which a regional park was established to protect local flora and fauna.

Traditional dresses 

The traditional women&#x27;s dress in Lecco was linked to the image of Lucia of &quot;The Betrothed&quot; and is characterized by the ray of silver pins, called &quot;guazze&quot;, which crown the head. 

Manzoni procession

Although discontinuously organized, the tradition of the parade of floats inspired by the episodes of the novel is well-rooted in the territory.

The first edition took place in 1923, on the fiftieth anniversary of Manzoni&#x27;s death. The procession was re-proposed in 1933, 1955, 1965, 2004, and October 2005, during the celebrations of the Festa di Lecco with 11 stage performances curated by 150 actors of the Teatro tascabile in Bergamo, along the old town center. 

Carnevalone of Lecco

In February, since 1884 (edition n° 136 in 2020), on the occasion of the &quot;Carnevalone di Lecco&quot;, there is the usual coronation of King Resegone and Regina Grigna, where the Mayor hands them the keys to the city to initiate the carnival folklore, that reaches its peak, according to the Ambrosian rite the city follows, with the Fat Saturday day and the traditional procession of floats.

ResegUp

It is a trail running that usually takes place on the first Saturday of June. Established in 2010, it aims to retrace the ancient paths that lead from the historic center to the summit of Resegone, erased over the years due to the urbanization of the city. 

Batej Regatta

It is the traditional regatta that takes place on the banks of the Adda river in July (variable date), on the occasion of the Palio delle contrade in Pescarenico. The boats are eight, each of them in different colors to represent the districts. The regatta is preceded by the regatta of the &quot;Lucie&quot;, the boats typical of the lake, and different representations of historical uses and customs typical of the area.

Scigamatt Race

Born in the district of Acquate during the event of the Scigalott d&#x27;Or (the name derives from the Lecco dialects Cicala d&#x27;oro), the race was held during the odd years on an obstacle course of in a mixed asphalt and dirt road. The event is in remembrance of 6 June 1859, when the inhabitants of the district went to Lecco to cheer General Giuseppe Garibaldi, accompanying him during the march with songs similar to the cicadas.

== Manzoni&#x27;s places ==
Manzoni&#x27;s places are the places, or what remains of them, that served as an inspiration to the writer and mentioned in the novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot;. A historical-literary-tourist itinerary, among the few old parts of the city spared from the urban expansion linked to industrial development, was created. Some places are historical, such as the monastery of Fra Cristoforo in Pescarenico or the Azzone Visconti bridge, others are indicated by tradition, such as the alleged house of Lucia Mondella in the district of Olate, the tabernacle of the Bravi, the Palazzotto of Don Rodrigo, the house of the tailor in Chiuso, the Innominato&#x27;s stronghold and Villa Manzoni in the Caleotto district (today the Manzonian Civic Museum), and the residence of Manzoni&#x27;s family in which he lived his childhood, adolescence, and early youth as he wrote in the introduction of the novel &quot;Fermo and Lucia&quot;.
=== Convent of Fra Cristoforo ===
Situated in the district of Pescarenico, this church is now dedicated to Saints Lucia and Materno. In &quot;The Betrothed&quot;, Manzoni cites this place as the conventual seat of Fra Cristoforo.
=== Alleged Lucia Mondella&#x27;s house ===
The alleged house of Lucia is located in Via Caldone 19 in the district of Olate (which at the time was separated from Lecco); designated by various scholars of manzonian topography as the village of the spouses, it is a typical example of the spontaneous architecture of Lecco. Through a portal decorated with a sixteenth-century Annunciation, you pass in the rustic courtyard, overlooked by an old tower, although it is not open to visitors as the house appears to be a private residence. The popular tradition points out another house of Lucia in Via Resegone, in the hamlet of Acquate, where there is an old inn, from whose courtyard you can clearly see the hill of Don Rodrigo&#x27;s Palace.

=== Tabernacolo dei Bravi ===
It is a small chapel located on the side of the pedestrian Via Tonio and Gervaso, described by the literary tradition of Manzoni as the place of the famous stakeout of Don Abbondio by the Bravi to tell him the message of their lord Don Rodrigo.

=== Villa Manzoni ===

The paternal residence of Alessandro Manzoni has a neoclassical style and it is located in the Caleotto district; it houses the Civic Museum of Manzoni and the Municipal Art Gallery. The building is considered the symbol of the link between Manzoni and the city of Lecco. The incipit of the novel comes from the meticulous visual memories of the landscape that the writer saw from this villa.

The municipality has two railway stations: Lecco, which is the town&#x27;s main station; and Lecco Maggianico, which is the second main railway station, also housing a freight terminal in its premises. For both stations, the main operator is Trenord.

===Navigation===
Whilst in the past there was a much more frequent navigation service around Lake Como departing from Lecco, in the recent year the town&#x27;s pier was mainly used for seasonal services, pleasure boat rides and charter services.

===Former modes of transport===
Between 1927 and 1953, Lecco had its own urban tramway network, which was connected to the Como-Erba-Lecco interurban tramway, which operated between 1928 and 1955. 

===Cable Car===
An aerial cable car operates between Versasio and Piani d&#x27;Erna, and was inaugurated in 1965.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s football team, Calcio Lecco 1912, was promoted to Serie B in 2023. Their traditional rivalry with the team of the city of Como is marked by the so-called &quot;Derby del Lario&quot;, often surrounded by violence between fans, created by the local ultras group Cani Sciolti.

The main sports facility of the city is the Rigamonti-Ceppi Stadium, where the football team trains and plays. It was built in 1922, in honor of the football player Mario Rigamonti and the ex-president of the team Mario Ceppi. It can contain almost 5000 people.

Lecco has been on multiple occasions the finish place of the Giro di Lombardia cycling classic.

==Notable people==
* Alessandro Manzoni (1785–1873), poet and novelist, author of &quot;I promessi sposi&quot;, belonged to an old family of Lecco.
* Antonio Stoppani (1824–1891), geologist and palaeontologist.

==Cultural references==
Alessandro Manzoni set the events in the first half of &quot;The Betrothed&quot; in Lecco, a town he knew deeply since he had spent part of his childhood there.

In 2022, Lecco native artist Baby Gang released the song &quot;Lecco City&quot;, describing the hardships of growing up around crime in the Italian town.

Lecco has been proposed as the location depicted in the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci.

<doc id="249838" wikidata="Q864930" url="?curid=249838" title="Bound (1996 film)">
<text>Bound is a 1996 American neo-noir erotic crime thriller film written and directed by the Wachowskis in their feature film directorial debut. It stars Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantoliano. The film centers on Violet (Tilly), a gun moll who longs to escape her relationship with her mobster boyfriend Caesar (Pantoliano), enters into a clandestine affair with alluring ex-con Corky (Gershon), and the two women hatch a scheme to steal $2 million of Mafia money. This was also John P. Ryan&#x27;s final appearance before he died in 2007. 

&quot;Bound&quot; was the first film directed by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from Billy Wilder to tell a noir story filled with sex and violence. Financed by Dino De Laurentiis, the film was made on a tight budget with the help of frugal crew members including cinematographer Bill Pope. The directors initially struggled to cast the lesbian characters of Violet and Corky before securing Tilly and Gershon. To choreograph the sex scenes, the directors employed sex educator Susie Bright as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; intimacy coordinator, and she also made a cameo appearance in the film.

&quot;Bound&quot; received several festival awards and positive reviews from film critics who praised the humor and style of the directors as well as the realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot superficial and criticized the violence as excessive. In the years since its release, the film has developed a cult following, particularly among LGBT+ audiences.

==Plot==

Corky, a lesbian ex-con, is hired as a painter and plumber at a Chicago apartment building. She encounters Violet and Caesar, the couple who live next door to the apartment she is renovating. While Caesar is gone, Violet seduces Corky. They are interrupted by Caesar and Corky returns to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows Corky to her truck, and they have sex in Corky&#x27;s apartment. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and that they have been together for five years.

Later, Violet overhears Caesar and his mob associates torturing Shelly, a man who has been embezzling money from the business. Upset, she confides to Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will bring the nearly $2 million that Shelly skimmed back to the apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. Johnnie, the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone, kills Shelly, angering Caesar, who returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Caesar washes, irons and hangs the money to dry.

Violet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. Corky devises a plan: when Caesar has finished counting the money, he will shower to unwind. While he does, Violet will purposely drop a bottle of Glenlivet scotch that Gino prefers and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, Corky will enter, steal the money from a briefcase, and leave. Violet will then return with the scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leave. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to flee because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not Johnnie.

When Caesar finds the money gone, he realizes Gino will think he stole it if he runs and decides to retrieve the money from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave, but Caesar forces her to stay, suspecting she and Johnnie may have stolen the money and framed him. Corky waits next door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After Johnnie flirts with Violet and taunts him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. He kills Gino, Johnnie and Roy, Gino&#x27;s bodyguard. Caesar tells Violet that they must find the money, dispose of the bodies and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived lest their mob associates discover their absence. Unable to find the money at Johnnie&#x27;s apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey, a mob buddy, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.

After discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, threatens to torture them and demands to know where it is. When Mickey arrives at the apartment, Caesar makes a deal with Violet to help him stall. Violet calls their landline from Johnnie&#x27;s cell phone and convinces Caesar to feign a conversation with Gino explaining that he and Johnnie are in the hospital after a car accident. The ruse fools Mickey, who leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar she has hidden the money in the next-door apartment, and he goes to retrieve it. Violet escapes and calls Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he assaults her. Violet arrives and holds Caesar at gunpoint; she informs him Mickey is coming and that he should run while he can. When Caesar refuses, Violet kills him.

Later, Mickey, who believes Violet&#x27;s story, tells her that he will find Caesar. Mickey wants Violet to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she needs a clean break—which she makes by driving off hand-in-hand with Corky.

==Cast==
== Themes ==
The Wachowskis describe several themes present in &quot;Bound&quot;. They say that the film is about &quot;the boxes people make of their lives&quot;, that it is not only gay people who &quot;live in closets&quot;. They wanted to define all of &quot;Bound&quot; characters by the &quot;sort of trap that they were making out of their lives&quot;. Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet&#x27;s closet, bound and gagged by Caesar. This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says &quot;I had this image of you inside of me...&quot; This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by the fact that most of the film takes place in Violet and Casear&#x27;s apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.

Susie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film. One is the concept of the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet&#x27;s hands. Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic motif to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet&#x27;s earring from the sink. Bright describes it as a movie that is &quot;wet&quot; (feminine) as opposed to &quot;hard&quot; (masculine). She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of &quot;lesbian signs&quot;. She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and &quot;girly&quot;—making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that &quot;everyone in the film wants to be with Violet&quot;. When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the LGBT film festival screenings.

==Development and production==
===Conception===
Film producer Joel Silver has said that after working as scriptwriters on &quot;Assassins&quot;, the Wachowskis made &quot;Bound&quot; as an &quot;audition piece&quot; to prove that they knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Silver &quot;made that up.&quot; The Wachowskis themselves claim they &quot;decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut.&quot; They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because those are the kinds of films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.

When executives at some studios read the script, they told the Wachowskis that if they changed the character of Corky to that of a man, they would be interested. The siblings declined, saying &quot;that movie&#x27;s been made a million times, so we&#x27;re really not interested in it.&quot; Dino De Laurentiis, the executive producer on &quot;Assassins&quot;, offered to finance &quot;Bound&quot; and his company produced it, giving them &quot;free rein&quot; with regard to the story. The film&#x27;s budget was $6 million.

===Casting===
The Wachowskis struggled to cast the roles of Violet and Corky, seemingly because of the lesbian content of the film. Few actresses were interested. The part of Violet was expected to go to Linda Hamilton, and Jennifer Tilly read for the part of Corky. She loved the role and was looking forward to playing a character very different from previous parts in her career. When the part of Violet became available, and Gina Gershon came in to read for Corky, Tilly agreed that Gershon would make a better Corky. She realized that she identified with the character of Violet, a woman &quot;underestimated by all the men around her&quot; who has to &quot;play the game&quot;. She describes it as the best role she had ever had. Gina Gershon suggested Joe Pantoliano to the Wachowskis for the part of Caesar. It was his first lead role in a film, and he describes it as his favorite.

===Filming===
&quot;Bound&quot; was filmed over a thirty-eight day period, in Santa Monica, California. The Wachowskis&#x27; original director of photography resigned, claiming that he could not film with the limited budget available, nor did he know anyone else who would be willing to work so cheaply. Subsequently, cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew &quot;a bunch of cheap guys&quot; who would be willing to work within the budget. Pope was heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew inspiration from their love of comics and were particularly influenced by Frank Miller&#x27;s neo-noir &quot;Sin City&quot; series. Pope&#x27;s sound counterpart was sound director Dane Davis. In the scene where Corky and Violet plan the theft, he chose to give Corky a cat-like quality, by supplying a &quot;swishing&quot; sound each time she walked past the camera.

The Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano to watch John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; and to focus on Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s character in order to portray Caesar&#x27;s paranoia. Gershon&#x27;s role was influenced by James Dean, Marlon Brando and Clint Eastwood. Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about the sex scenes, and prepared for filming by drinking tequila.

Very little improvisation took place during the filming due to the directors&#x27; extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Despite their planning, the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel was injured, when his head was banged against a toilet, in the scene where Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar&#x27;s bathroom. Gina Gershon was also injured. In a scene between Corky and Caesar, near the end of the film, Gershon struck a gun from Pantoliano&#x27;s hand so violently she required stitches.

Having Corky play a jaw harp was Gina Gershon&#x27;s idea. The Wachowskis wanted to use &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; and Frank Sinatra songs, but their song budget would not cover it.

===Sex scenes===
The sex scenes were choreographed by feminist writer and sex educator Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright and sent her a copy of the script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. Bright loved the script, particularly as it was about women unapologetically having and enjoying sex. Disappointed by the lack of description in the sex scenes, she offered to be a sex consultant for the film, and they accepted. The main sex scene, set in Corky&#x27;s apartment, was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that the continuous shot would be more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it was intended to be a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.

Bright appeared as Jesse, the woman Corky tries to talk to in the bar. Comedian Margaret Smith played Jesse&#x27;s girlfriend and the extras in the bar scene were Bright&#x27;s friends—&quot;real life San Francisco dykes&quot;.

=== Music ===
The film score was written and conducted by Don Davis, who would later collaborate with the Wachowskis on &quot;The Matrix Trilogy&quot;. The film features the songs &quot;I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You&quot; by Aretha Franklin, &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot; by Ray Charles, &quot;She&#x27;s a Lady&quot; by Tom Jones, and &quot;Hopeless Faith&quot; by the riot grrl band The Hail Marys.

==Release==
===Rating===
&quot;Bound&quot; was rated by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) as R for &quot;strong sexuality, violence and language.&quot; To achieve that rating, the directors had to cut part of the first sex scene between Corky and Violet. The MPAA were most concerned with the images of what Lana Wachowski called &quot;hand-sex&quot;. It was rated R in Australia, R18 in New Zealand and 18 in the United Kingdom. In Canada it was rated as R in Manitoba and Ontario, 18 in Nova Scotia and 16+ in Quebec.

===Distribution===
The film premiered on August 31, 1996, at the Venice Film Festival and in September went on to play at the Toronto International Film Festival. It opened in U.S. theaters on October 4, 1996, distributed by Gramercy Pictures, showing in 261 theaters. It closed after three weeks. It opened in the United Kingdom on February 28, 1997.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Bound&quot; grossed $3,802,260 in the United States and $3,209,057 from other territories, for a worldwide total of $7,011,317. In its opening weekend, showing at 261 theaters, it earned $900,902, which was 23.7% of its total gross. According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at 161 for all films released in the United States in 1996, and at 74 for R-rated films released that year. , its all-time ranking for LGBT-related films is 59.

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave it a positive rating of 87% based on 67 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Bound&quot;″s more titillating elements attracted attention, but it&#x27;s the stylish direction, solid performances, and entertaining neo-noir caper plot that make it worth a watch&quot;. Metacritic gave it a score of 61/100 based on 19 reviews, signifying &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The Wachowskis&#x27; direction was praised, being described as clever, sophisticated and stylish. Roger Ebert said that their skillful film making showed virtuosity and confidence. Marjorie Baumgarten writing for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; called it an impressive debut saying that the Wachowskis have &quot;style to burn&quot;. James Kendrick called it a darkly comical and stunning film, saying it signalled the arrival of the Wachowskis on the film scene. Detractors of the film included Todd McCarthy for &quot;Variety&quot;, who said that the directors had no sense of humor and lacked depth, that the film was pretentious, superficial and heavy-handed.

On the release of &quot;Bound&quot;, the Wachowskis were compared by many to the Coen Brothers. Rita Kempley for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; went so far as to call them &quot;Coen Brothers clones&quot;. In particular, similarities were drawn between &quot;Bound&quot; and the Coen Brothers&#x27; first film, 1984 neo-noir &quot;Blood Simple&quot;. Bryant Frazer for &quot;Deep Focus&quot; called it an &quot;obvious precursor&quot;. Critics noted resemblances to the films of Quentin Tarantino and Alfred Hitchcock.

Janet Maslin for &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the grisly violence in &quot;Bound&quot; would likely limit its audience and Ebert said that its shocking violence would offend some audiences. Some critics said that the violent behavior of the characters had no moral justification. Rita Kempley for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;well-nigh unwatchable cruelty for its own sake&quot;. McCarthy, who called the central relationship between the two women unbelievable and unsympathetic, said &quot;just because Violet and Corky fall for each other doesn&#x27;t mean they somehow fall into a privileged state of grace in which vile behavior can be forgiven.&quot; Other critics were less concerned, calling the violence &quot;comically excessive&quot; and &quot;Tarantino-like&quot;.

&quot;Bound&quot; was praised for being perhaps the first mainstream film to have a lesbian relationship at its heart without homosexuality being central to the plot. Despite the presence of &quot;unapologetically gay&quot; lead character Corky, it is not commonly considered a &quot;lesbian movie&quot;. Emanuel Levy said that this is a weakness, that mainstream films with broadening storylines &quot;do not necessarily represent a positive development in the making of gay and lesbian films&quot; and that &quot;Bound&quot; has &quot;little, if anything, to do with lesbian cinema&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called it a &quot;welcome change&quot; to have a lesbian couple as the main characters in a mainstream film. Sarah Warn for AfterEllen.com called Corky &quot;the closest thing to a realistic and sympathetic butch lesbian we&#x27;ve seen in a mainstream movie&quot;. Barry Walters for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised the film for showing gay characters that have an active sex life. The sex scenes, described as explicit and steamy, were admired for being tasteful, discreet and realistic. Warn called them &quot;some of the best lesbian sex scenes to date in a mainstream movie&quot;.

The three lead actors were complimented for their performances. Ebert said that Gershon and Tilly were electric together, and Frazer said that he would have liked to have seen more of their love story. Some critics described their onscreen relationship as unbelievable and unsympathetic. Gershon was seen to have made a comeback after her role in the less well received 1995 film &quot;Showgirls&quot;. Tilly&#x27;s performance was compared to her Academy Award-nominated part in &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot;. Pantoliano was described as &quot;a lot of fun&quot; and having the &quot;trickiest scenes in the movie&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Bound&quot; won the Grand Jury Award—Honorable Mention at the 1996 L.A. Outfest, and in the same year won an Honorable Mention at the Stockholm International Film Festival. At the 1997 Fantasporto festival in Portugal, the Wachowskis were awarded the International Fantasy Film Award for best film, and Jennifer Tilly picked up the award for best actress. &quot;Bound&quot; won the 1997 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding (wide-release) Film. The film was nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

<text>Maracaibo ( , ; ) is a city and municipality in northwestern Venezuela, on the western shore of the strait that connects Lake Maracaibo to the Gulf of Venezuela. It is the second-largest city in Venezuela, after the national capital, Caracas, and the capital of the state of Zulia. The population of the city is approximately 2,658,355 with the metropolitan area estimated at 5,278,448 .
Maracaibo is nicknamed &quot;The Beloved Land of the Sun&quot; ().

Maracaibo is considered the economic center of western Venezuela, owing to the petroleum industry that developed in the shores of Lake Maracaibo. It is sometimes known as &quot;The First City of Venezuela&quot;, for being the first city in Venezuela to adopt various types of public services, including electricity, as well as for being located in the shores of Lake Maracaibo, where the name of Venezuela allegedly originates.

Early indigenous settlements around the area were of Arawak and Carib origin. Maracaibo&#x27;s founding date is disputed. There were failed attempts to found the city—in 1529, by Captain Ambrosio Ehinger, and in 1569, by Captain Alonso Pacheco. Founded in 1574 as Nueva Zamora de la Laguna de Maracaibo by Captain Pedro Maldonado, the city became a transshipment point for inland settlements after Gibraltar, at the head of the lake, had been destroyed by pirates in 1669. It was not until the first decades of the 17th century that the first town was settled. Petroleum was discovered in 1917, leading to a large increase in population from migration.

Maracaibo is served by La Chinita International Airport. The General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge connects Maracaibo to the rest of the country.

== Etymology ==

The name Maracaibo is said to derive from the brave &quot;cacique&quot; (indigenous chief) Mara, a young native who valiantly resisted the Spaniards and died fighting them.

Legend says that when Mara fell, the Coquivacoa shouted &quot;&quot;Mara cayó!&quot; (&quot;Mara fell!&quot;&quot;), thus originating the city name—although it would be strange for them to shout in Spanish. Other historians say that the first name of this land in the local language was &quot;Maara-iwo&quot; meaning &quot;Place where serpents abound&quot;.

== History ==

===Foundation===
The first indigenous settlements were of Arawak and Carib origin. Around the main group were the Añu tribe who built rows of stilt houses all over the northern riviera of Lake Maracaibo. The first Europeans arrived in 1499.

The city was founded three times: the first time was during the Klein-Venedig period (1528–1546), when the Welser bankers of Augsburg received a concession over Venezuela Province from Charles I of Spain. In August 1529, the German Ambrosius Ehinger made his first expedition to Lake Maracaibo, which was bitterly opposed by the indigenous Coquivacoa. After winning a series of bloody battles, he founded the settlement on 8 September 1529. Ehinger named the settlement New Nuremberg () and the lake after the valiant chieftain Mara of the Coquivacoa, who had died in the fighting. The city was renamed Maracaibo after the Spanish took possession. The lack of activity in the zone made Nikolaus Federmann evacuate the village in 1535 and move its population to Santa Marta near the then capital of Venezuela Province, Santa Ana de Coro.

A second attempt by Captain Alonso Pacheco in 1569 suffered a brief setback when the city had to be evacuated in 1573 due to ferocious attacks by native local tribes. The European settlement returned a short while later, in 1574, however, for which it was re-founded by Captain Pedro Maldonado under Governor Diego de Mazariegos&#x27;s command and assuming the name of Nueva Zamora de Maracaibo. &quot;Nueva Zamora&quot; comes from Mazariego&#x27;s place of birth, Zamora, in Spain. Since its definite foundation, the town began to develop as a whole. It is based on the western side of Lake Maracaibo, the dominant feature of the oil-rich Maracaibo Basin. Favored by prevailing winds and a protected harbour, the city is located on the shores of the lake where the narrows, which eventually lead to the Gulf of Venezuela, first become pronounced.

===Pirate attacks===

The Dutch corsair Henrik de Gerard plundered Maracaibo in 1614, and in 1642 the city was attacked by the British pirate William Jackson. In 1667, l&#x27;Olonnais with a fleet of eight ships and a crew of six hundred pirates sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar. En route, l&#x27;Olonnais crossed paths with a Spanish treasure ship, which he captured, along with its rich cargo of cacao, gemstones and more than 260,000 pieces of eight.

In March 1669, Henry Morgan sacked Maracaibo, which emptied when his fleet was first spied and moved on to the Spanish settlement of Gibraltar on the inside of Lake Maracaibo in search of more treasure. A few weeks later, when he attempted to sail out of the lake, Morgan found an occupied fort blocking the inlet to the Caribbean, along with three Spanish ships. These were the &quot;Magdalena&quot;, the &quot;San Luis&quot;, and the &quot;Soledad&quot;. He destroyed the Magdalena and burned the San Luis by sending a dummy ship full of gunpowder to explode near them, after which the crew of the &quot;Soledad&quot; surrendered. By faking a landward attack on the fort, thereby convincing the Spanish governor to shift his cannon, he eluded their guns and escaped.

In June 1678, Michel de Grammont, the French commander of six ships and 700 men, captured Maracaibo then followed the plundering of several smaller towns as Gibraltar, penetrating as far inland as Trujillo.

=== Venezuelan Independence ===

In 1810, the province of Maracaibo did not join the First Republic of Venezuela and remained loyal to the Spanish crown. Maracaibo then held the seat of the Captaincy General of Venezuela.

In 1821, uprisings in favor of independence began to lead to warfare and hostility. The royalists, led by Francisco Tomás Morales, fought with the patriots, led by Rafael Urdaneta, to take back control over the province in the Juana de Ávila Battle, and Morales brought back Spanish rule in 1822 until he was defeated in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo on 24 July 1823, culminating Venezuela&#x27;s struggle for independence.

=== Isolation period ===
For about 380 years, Maracaibo remained isolated and separated from the rest of the country. Transportation to the area was possible through the lake via boats and ferries. Commerce and culture flowed between Maracaibo and the Caribbean Sea, particularly the Dutch Antilles, Colombian coastal cities, Cuba, Hispaniola and later on Miami, New York and Hamburg.

This isolation from the rest of Venezuela was both a challenge and an advantage. The very nature of the city&#x27;s location made for a population known for their independent thought and character. The history of this region is rife with stories about the creation of an independent and sovereign nation apart from Venezuela, a nation called , &#x27;the Independent Republic of Zulia&#x27;, but this has never come to be.

Come the 20th century, cars, buses, and lorries, with their constant flow of manufactured goods and agricultural product to and from the city port, depended on ferry services between the city and the eastern shore which was poorly connected to the country&#x27;s motorway system. Maracaibo and the Lake Maracaibo region&#x27;s economy was more linked to Colombia and the Caribbean than to eastern Venezuela due to the natural route available through Lake Maracaibo then leading to the sea.

In January 1903, as the naval blockade of Venezuela continued during the negotiations with presidente Cipriano Castro, the German gunboat attempted to enter Lake Maracaibo, which was a center of German commercial activity. On 17 January, it exchanged fire with the settlement of Fort San Carlos, but withdrew after half an hour, as shallow waters prevented it getting close enough to the fort to be effective. The Venezuelans claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the protected cruiser , with heavier weapons, to set an example. On 21 January, &quot;Vineta&quot; bombarded the fort, setting fire to it and destroying it, with the death of 25 civilians in the nearby town.

In 1908, the &quot;Friesland&quot;, &quot;Gelderland&quot; and &quot;Jacob van Heemskerck&quot;
were sent to patrol the Venezuelan coast during the second Castro crisis. &quot;Friesland&quot; guarded the entry way to Maracaibo.

=== Building of the bridge ===
The dictatorial regime of General Marcos Pérez Jiménez in the 1950s set as a goal the construction of a bridge connecting the two lake shores. Various bridge projects for the spanning of the Lake Maracaibo narrows near the city were in the works. The general&#x27;s government had decided that this &quot;city of independent thought&quot; should be more &quot;connected&quot; to the rest of the country.

Proposals for a bridge design that included rail transport and tourist facilities were seriously considered. The fall of the Pérez Jiménez regime on January 23, 1958, quickly led to a less elaborate design project that was approved and funded by a democratic and more financially responsible government.

The building of (&#x27;General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge over Lake Maracaibo&#x27;) named after the distinguished general and war of independence hero was opened to public traffic in 1962 connecting the city to its opposite shore neighbors and the rest of the country through a new system of highways. The project was completed on schedule in 40 months.

This bridge construction project was a remarkable feat. Built under very difficult conditions, when completed, it became the longest prestressed concrete bridge in the world. The structure is in constant use and remains today as the most important link between Maracaibo, along with much of the state of Zulia, and the rest of Venezuela.

=== Modern times ===

François de Pons, an agent to the French government in Caracas, provides some historical insight into the people of Maracaibo in his travel journal . The following excerpts describe the local population of Maracaibo:

:&quot;They perform coasting, or long voyages, with equal facility; and when all trade is suspended by the operations of war, they enter privateers. Bred up in the neighbourhood of the lake, they are mostly all expert swimmers and excellent divers. Their reputation stands equally high as soldiers. Those who do not enter into the sea service, form plantations, or assist in cultivating those that belong to their fathers. Nothing proves better their aptitude for this kind of occupation, than the immense flocks of cattle with which the savannas of Maracaybo are covered.&quot;

He also notes the appreciation of literature, the arts, education, and culture among the people of Maracaibo:

:&quot;But what confers the greatest honour on the inhabitants of Maracaibo, is their application to literature; in which, notwithstanding the wretched state of public education, they make considerable progress...They likewise acquired the art of elocution, and of writing their mother tongue with the greatest purity; in a word, they possessed all the qualities that characterise men of letters.&quot;

Maracaibo has become a large metropolitan city, comprising two municipalities: the municipality of Maracaibo proper, and the municipality of San Francisco, established in 1995, to the south. In recent years, due to political/economic and cultural reasons, many have moved to Maracaibo from rural areas and other cities (including Caracas).

Maracaibo also boasts one of the best universities in the country, the state university, &quot;La Universidad del Zulia&quot; (LUZ) is well renowned for its excellent law, medical and engineering schools as many other disciplines. Other universities and schools include Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chacín (URBE) and Universidad Rafael Urdaneta, with one of the country&#x27;s leading psychology schools. However, recent political instability has led to the decline of the universidad.

The Diocese of Maracaibo (23 July 1965) was elevated to Archdiocese on 30 April 1966 by Pope Paulus VI. Maracaibo was visited by Pope John Paul II in 1985. Since November 2000, its Archbishop has been Ubaldo Ramón Santana Sequera.

In 2019, power outages and widespread poverty caused a citywide wave of violence and looting, resulting in mass emigration, most of which was headed to the United States.

==Economy==
Zulia&#x27;s main income comes from oil extraction and refining, agriculture (coffee, rice, maize, cassava, cocoa, sugar cane),
livestock production, and mining (clay, limestone, coal and sand).

== Geography ==

The municipality of Maracaibo is divided into 18 parishes as follows:
=== Districts ===
===Climate===
Maracaibo is one of the hottest cities in Venezuela and all of South America as well. The rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta gives the city a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;)
Attenuated only by the moderating influence of the lake; Maracaibo&#x27;s average historical temperature is . In the past, the climate of the city, indeed all along the coast of Lake Maracaibo, was unhealthy due to the combination of high temperatures with high humidity. Today, control of plagues and the effects of urban development has largely eradicated these health problems. The registered high temperature of the city is , and the lowest is .
== Education ==
=== Colleges and universities ===
Several universities are based in the city:
* Universidad del Zulia - (LUZ)
* Nacional Experimental de la Fuerza Armada UNEFA
* Universidad Rafael Belloso Chacín - (URBE)
* Universidad Rafael Urdaneta
* Universidad Católica Cecilio Acosta
* Universidad Dr. José Gregorio Hernández
* Universidad Bolivariano de Venezuela sede Zulia
* Universidad Nacional Abierta (UNA) Centro Local Zulia

===International schools===

* Escuela Bella Vista (American school)
* Colegio Alemán de Maracaibo, formerly Colegio Alemán del Zulia (German school)

== Sports ==

Due to the regionalistic nature of Marabinos, they strongly support their native teams. Maracaibo, and the rest of Zulia, are represented in baseball by the Águilas del Zulia, a Venezuelan winter league team that plays in the Liga Venezolana de Béisbol Profesional, and is based in the Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande. The city&#x27;s basketball team is Gaiteros del Zulia, which plays in the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto de Venezuela. Its home is the 5.000-people &quot;Pedro Elías Belisario Aponte&quot; stadium. Other teams include the Unión Atlético Maracaibo and the Zulia FC in football, the Maracaibo Rugby Football Club and the Zulianos Rugby Club.

In the 2000 Little League World Series, the Sierra Maestra Little League of Maracaibo, Venezuela defeated Bellaire Little League of Bellaire, Texas in the championship game of the 54th Little League World Series. The Coquivocoa Little League team from Maracaibo placed third in the 1974 Little League World Series.

Rugby in Venezuela was first played in Maracaibo, thanks to the influence of the English community based on the Zulia State

* Basketball: Gaiteros del Zulia
* Soccer: Unión Atlético Maracaibo, Zulia FC
* Rugby: Maracaibo Rugby Football Club &quot;Oil Blacks&quot;, Zulianos Rugby Club

== Culture ==

Culture in Maracaibo maintains strong Indigenous influences, from its gaitas, desserts, style, and other customs. Most major houses of advertising in Venezuela acknowledge how different the culture of Maracaibo is from that of Caracas. Studies of both prove, for example, that Caracas&#x27; leading soft drink brand is Coke, while in Maracaibo it is Pepsi. This has made many brands create special localized advertising of their products (including several Pepsi commercials spoken by local celebrities).

The Gaita is a style of Venezuelan folk music from Maracaibo. According to Joan Corominas, it may come from gaits, the Gothic word for &quot;goat&quot;, which is the skin generally used for the membrane of the &quot;furro&quot; instrument. Other instruments used in gaita include maracas, cuatro, charrasca and tambora (Venezuelan drum). Song themes range from humorous and love songs to protest songs. The style became popular throughout Venezuela in the 1960s, and it fused with other styles such as salsa and merengue in the 1970s. Famous gaita groups include Maracaibo 15, Gran Coquivacoa, Barrio Obrero, Cardenales del Éxito, Koquimba, Melody Gaita, Guaco, Estrellas del Zulia, Saladillo, and many others.

<text>The Mackenzie River (French: &#x27;; Slavey: [tèh tʃʰò], literally &quot;big river&quot;; Inuvialuktun: &quot;&quot;&#x27; [kuːkpɑk], literally &quot;great river&quot;) is a river in the Canadian boreal forest and tundra. It forms, along with the Slave, Peace, and Finlay, the longest river system in Canada, and includes the second largest drainage basin of any North American river after the Mississippi.

The Mackenzie River flows through a vast, thinly populated region of forest and tundra entirely within the Northwest Territories in Canada, although its many tributaries reach into five other Canadian provinces and territories. The river&#x27;s main stem is long, flowing north-northwest from Great Slave Lake into the Arctic Ocean, where it forms a large delta at its mouth. Its extensive watershed drains about 20 percent of Canada. It is the largest river flowing into the Arctic from North America, and including its tributaries has a total length of , making it the thirteenth longest river system in the world.

The ultimate source of the Mackenzie River is Thutade Lake, in the Northern Interior of British Columbia. The Mackenzie valley is believed to have been the path taken by prehistoric peoples during the initial human migration from Asia to North America over 10,000 years ago, despite sparse evidence. The Inuvialuit, Gwich&#x27;in and other Indigenous peoples lived along the river for thousands of years. The river provided the major route into Canada&#x27;s northern interior for early European explorers.

Economic development remains limited along the river. During the 19th century, fur trading became a lucrative business, but this was affected by harsh weather conditions. The discovery of oil at Norman Wells in the 1920s began a period of industrialization in the Mackenzie valley. Metallic minerals have been found along the eastern and southern edges of the basin; these include uranium, gold, lead, and zinc. Agriculture remains prevalent along the south, particularly in the Peace River area. Various tributaries and headwaters of the river have been developed for hydroelectricity production, flood control and irrigation.

==Geography==

===Headwaters===
Through its many tributaries, the Mackenzie River basin covers portions of five Canadian provinces and territories — British Columbia (BC), Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. Thutade Lake, in the Northern Interior of BC, is the ultimate source of the Mackenzie River via the Finlay–Peace River system, which stretches through BC and Alberta. The Athabasca River originates further south, in Jasper National Park in southwest Alberta. Together, the Peace and Athabasca rivers drain a significant portion of the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and the central Alberta prairie. The Peace contributes the majority of the water, about 66 km3 (54 million acre-feet) per year, and the Athabasca contributes 25 km3 (20 million acre-feet).

The Peace and Athabasca meet at the Peace-Athabasca Delta, a vast inland delta at the western end of Lake Athabasca, which also takes runoff from the northern third of Saskatchewan. The Slave River is formed by the confluence of the two rivers and flows due north into Great Slave Lake, at Fort Resolution, Northwest Territories. The Slave is by far the largest river flowing into the lake, with an annual flow of 108 km3 (87 million acre-feet). It contributes about 77% of the overall inflow, and forms a large delta where it enters the lake. Other rivers entering Great Slave Lake are the Taltson, Lockhart and Hay Rivers, the latter of which also extends into Alberta and BC.

===Main stem===
The Mackenzie River issues from the western end of Great Slave Lake about south-west of Yellowknife. The channel is initially several kilometres wide but narrows to about at Fort Providence, which was historically an important ferry crossing in the summer, and used as an ice bridge in the winter for traffic along the Yellowknife Highway. In 2012 the Deh Cho Bridge was completed at a point about upstream, providing a safer permanent crossing. It is the only bridge across the main stem of the Mackenzie. West of Fort Providence the Mackenzie widens considerably, resembling a shallow, swampy lake more than a river; one large widening here is known as Mills Lake.

After heading west for about the Mackenzie narrows and turns northwest through a long stretch of fast water and rapids, past the village of Jean Marie River. At Fort Simpson it is joined by the Liard River, its biggest direct tributary, from the west. The Liard drains a large area in the southern Yukon and northern British Columbia and carries a large amount of sediment during the summer melt which does not fully mix with the clear water in the Mackenzie for almost downstream, resulting in a clear current on the east bank and muddy water on the west bank.
The river continues west-northwest until its confluence with the North Nahanni River, where it turns north towards the Arctic. It flows through open taiga with its wide valley bounded, on the west, by the Mackenzie Mountains and to the east by low hills of the Canadian Shield. This mostly uninhabited area is called the Mackenzie Lowlands; although partly forested, it is mostly covered by large areas of muskeg, swamps and many small lakes. A number of major tributaries join from the west, including the Root River, Redstone River and Keele River. Below the Keele River, the Mackenzie River flows north along the western base of the Franklin Mountains before turning northwest, and receives the Great Bear River, the outflow of Great Bear Lake at Tulita.

The Mackenzie widens considerably to about at Norman Wells, a major centre of oil production. There is a narrows at the Mountain River confluence called the Sans Sault Rapids, where the Mackenzie falls about . Below the Mountain River the Mackenzie flows due north until reaching The Ramparts, a limestone gorge barely wide and up to deep. Below The Ramparts is the village of Fort Good Hope, where the Mackenzie turns northwest again, soon crossing the Arctic Circle. The Mackenzie here flows slightly lower in elevation than the surrounding tundra, as a braided river between low bluffs about apart. It receives the Arctic Red River from the southwest at Tsiigehtchic, where traffic on the Dempster Highway crosses via ferry/ice bridge.

About northwest of Tsiigehtchic is Point Separation, the head of the vast Mackenzie River Delta, whose branching channels, ponds and wetlands spread across more than of the coastal plain. The delta is nearly from north to south, and ranges in width from . It is the second biggest Arctic delta in the world, after the Lena River delta in Russia. Most land in the Mackenzie delta consists of permafrost, which reaches as deep as the bedrock. A characteristic feature of the delta is its numerous pingos, or hills of earth-covered-ice – some 1,400 of them. The Peel River, carrying much of the runoff from the northern Yukon, joins in the delta at a point northeast of Fort McPherson. Below there, the Mackenzie diverges into several large channels with the largest heading north-northeast, emptying into the Beaufort Sea west of Tuktoyaktuk. The Mackenzie Delta contains a logjam with 400,000 caches of wood, which stores 3.4 million tons of carbon, equivalent to a year&#x27;s emissions from 2.5 million cars.

===Drainage basin===

At , the Mackenzie River drainage basin encompasses nearly 20 percent of Canada. About , or 54 percent of the basin, lies above Great Slave Lake. Permafrost underlies about three-quarters of the watershed, reaching up to deep in the Mackenzie Delta. As a whole, the Mackenzie basin receives only meager to moderate rainfall, averaging over the entire basin, though mountain areas experience much higher precipitation, and areas near and north of the Arctic Circle receive much lower precipitation.

The Mackenzie drainage basin is bordered by multiple major North American watersheds. Much of the western edge of the Mackenzie basin runs along the Continental Divide. The divide separates the Mackenzie watershed from that of the Yukon River, which flows to the Bering Strait; and the Fraser River and Columbia River systems, both of which empty into the Pacific Ocean. Lowland divides in the north separate the Mackenzie basin from the Arctic Ocean watersheds of the Anderson, Horton, Coppermine and Back Rivers. In the east, the Mackenzie borders on the Hudson Bay watersheds of the Thelon and Churchill Rivers, and to the south it is bordered by the Saskatchewan–Nelson River system, which also empties into Hudson Bay. The Mackenzie system is hydrologically connected to the Hudson Bay watershed via Wollaston Lake, which is not only the source of the Fond du Lac tributary of Lake Athabasca, but also of the Cochrane River, which flows east into the Churchill River.

The eastern portion of the Mackenzie basin is dominated by vast reaches of lake-studded boreal forest and includes many of the largest lakes in North America. By both volume and surface area, Great Bear Lake is the biggest in the watershed and third largest on the continent, with a surface area of and a volume of . Great Slave Lake is slightly smaller, with an area of and containing of water, although it is significantly deeper than Great Bear. The third major lake, Athabasca, is less than a third that size with an area of . Six other lakes in the watershed cover more than , including the Williston Lake reservoir, the second-largest artificial lake in North America, on the Peace River.

===Flow characteristics===
The river discharges more than of water each year, accounting for roughly 11% of the total river flow into the Arctic Ocean. The river is frozen for most of the year, with the ice typically breaking up by early to mid-May in the south, and late May-early June in the north. Ice breaks up earlier on the tributaries, sometimes causing ice jams and flooding where they meet the Mackenzie. In the middle of the larger lakes, such as Great Slave, ice can persist as late as mid-June. The river typically freezes by late October or November, starting in the north. Year round, the Mackenzie&#x27;s outflow has a major stabilizing effect in the local climate above the Arctic Ocean with large amounts of warmer fresh water mixing with the cold seawater.
The average flow rate at the mouth is , the second largest in Canada after the St Lawrence, and the fourteenth largest in the world. About 60 percent of the water comes from the western half of the basin, which includes the Rocky, Selwyn, and Mackenzie mountain ranges out of which spring major tributaries such as the Peace and Liard Rivers, which contribute 23 and 27 percent of the total flow, respectively. In contrast the eastern half, despite being dominated by marshland and large lakes, provides only about 25 percent of the Mackenzie&#x27;s discharge.

During peak flow in the spring, the difference in discharge between the two halves of the watershed becomes even more marked. While large amounts of snow and glacial melt dramatically drive up water levels in the Mackenzie&#x27;s western tributaries, large lakes to the east retard springtime discharges. Spring floods from the Peace-Athabasca system are significantly slowed by the delta area at the western end of Lake Athabasca causing the lake to rise, and the excess water can only flow out after the rivers have receded. The same phenomenon occurs at Great Slave Lake, which naturally regulates the flow from the Slave River into the Mackenzie.

There are river gauges at several upstream points along the Mackenzie River. The average flow rate at the outlet of Great Slave Lake is . At Fort Simpson, below the Liard River, it is . At Norman Wells it is , and at the Arctic Red confluence it is .

==Geology==
As recently as the last glacial maximum about 30,000 years ago, the majority of northern Canada was buried under the enormous continental Laurentide Ice Sheet. The tremendous erosive powers of the Laurentide and its predecessors, at maximum extent, completely buried what is now the Mackenzie watershed under thousands of metres of ice and flattened the eastern portions of the watershed. When the ice sheet receded for the last time, it left a long proglacial lake, Lake McConnell, of which Great Bear, Great Slave and Athabasca Lakes are remnants. 

Today&#x27;s Mackenzie River is very young in geologic terms – its channel formed over a period of no more than several thousand years as the ice sheet retreated. Prior to the ice ages, only the Peel River tributary flowed through what is now the Mackenzie Delta into the Arctic Ocean. The other tributaries of the Mackenzie combined into the &quot;Bell River&quot; which flowed east into Hudson Bay. During glaciation the weight of the ice sheet depressed northern Canada&#x27;s terrain to such an extent that when the ice retreated, the Mackenzie system was captured to lower elevations in the northwest, establishing the present flow direction to the Arctic.

Fluvial deposits and other erosional evidence indicate that around the end of the Pleistocene, about 13,000 years ago, the Mackenzie channel was scoured by one or more massive glacial lake outburst floods unleashed from Lake Agassiz, formed by melting ice west of the present-day Great Lakes. At its peak, Agassiz had a greater volume than all present-day freshwater lakes combined. This is believed to have disrupted currents in the Arctic Ocean and led to an abrupt 1,300-year-long cold temperature shift called the Younger Dryas.

The Mackenzie carries a very large sediment load, transporting about 128 million tonnes each year to its delta. The Liard River alone accounts for 32 percent of the total, and the Peel River about 20 percent. Essentially all of the sediment is contributed by areas downstream of Fort Providence, since upstream sediment is trapped in Great Slave Lake.

==Ecology==

The Mackenzie River&#x27;s watershed is considered one of the largest and most intact ecosystems in North America, especially the northern half. Approximately 63% of the drainage basin, or , is forested (mostly boreal forest). Wetlands comprise about 18%, or about , of the basin. More than 93% of forested areas are virgin old-growth forest. However, human activities such as oil extraction have threatened water quality in the headwaters of the Mackenzie River. In addition, a warming climate in northern parts of the watershed is melting permafrost and destabilizing soil through erosion.

Most of the taiga consists of black spruce, aspen and poplar forest. In the north, the river&#x27;s shores are lined with sparse vegetation like dwarf birch and willows, as well as extensive areas of muskeg and peat bogs. South of Great Slave Lake, there are much larger reaches of temperate and alpine forest, prairie, and fertile floodplain and riparian habitat.

There are 53 fish species in the basin, none of them endemic. The Mackenzie River has a similar range of fish fauna to the Mississippi River system. It is believed that the two river systems were connected during the Ice Ages by meltwater lakes and channels, allowing fish in the two rivers to interbreed. Fish in the Mackenzie River proper include the northern pike, several minnow species, and lake whitefish. Fish in the southern half of the watershed are genetically isolated from those of the northern half due to large rapids on the Slave River preventing fish from swimming upstream.

Migratory birds use the three major deltas in the Mackenzie River basin — the Mackenzie Delta and the inland Slave and Peace-Athabasca Deltas — as resting and breeding areas. The latter is located at the convergence of four major North American migratory routes, or flyways. As recently as the mid-twentieth century, more than 400,000 birds passed through during the spring and up to a million in autumn. Some 215 bird species in total have been catalogued in the delta, including species such as the whooping crane, peregrine falcon, and the bald eagle. The construction of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam on the Peace River has reduced the seasonal variations of water levels in the delta, causing damage to its ecosystem. Bird populations have seen a steady decline since the 1960s.

Water mammals such as beavers and muskrats are extremely common in the Mackenzie Delta and surrounding areas of muskeg. The Mackenzie estuary is also a calving area for beluga whales.

The Mackenzie valley is believed to have been the path taken by prehistoric peoples during the initial human migration from Asia to North America more than 10,000 years ago. However, archaeological evidence of human habitation along the Mackenzie is scant, despite the efforts of many researchers. Many archaeological sites have probably been destroyed by flooding, freeze-thaw and erosion. The Inuvialuit, Gwich&#x27;in and other Indigenous peoples have lived along the river for thousands of years; however, the oldest known evidence of continuous occupation stretches back only about 1300–1400 years, at the Gwich&#x27;in community of Tsiigehtchic.

The Mackenzie provided the major route into Canada&#x27;s northern interior for European explorers as early as the late 18th century. Scottish explorer Alexander Mackenzie travelled the river in the hope it would lead to the Pacific Ocean, but instead reached its mouth on the Arctic Ocean on 14 July 1789. There is a story, likely apocryphal, that he named it &quot;Disappointment River&quot;, but eventually it was named after him. No European reached its mouth again until Sir John Franklin on 16 August 1825 during the 1825–1827 Mackenzie River expedition. The following year he traced the coast west until blocked by ice while John Richardson followed the coast east to the Coppermine River. In 1849 William Pullen reached the Mackenzie from the Bering Strait.
In the following decades the North West Company established forts on the river, the precursors of present-day settlements such as Fort Simpson (formerly Fort of the Forks). A lucrative fur trade was carried out, as the Mackenzie basin teemed with beaver and muskrat. However, the short summer and harsh winter conditions limited trappers&#x27; activities. During the late 19th century Fort Simpson was regional headquarters for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The first fur trappers were native, but starting in the 1920s increasing numbers of European trappers entered the region. Beaver and muskrat populations were heavily depleted, especially in areas around and south of Great Slave Lake.

Catholic missionary Henri Grollier founded missions at Fort Simpson, Fort Norman and Fort Good Hope between 1858 and 1859.

During the late 19th century and early 20th century epidemics of introduced European diseases swept through Indigenous communities along the river, and thousands of native people lost their lives. One particularly severe influenza in 1928 killed as many as one in ten native people along the Mackenzie River. Fort Providence lost 20 percent of its population, and some smaller villages and camps were completely wiped out.

Steamboat service on the Mackenzie River began in the 1880s, and the number of vessels surged in the early 1900s as the Klondike Gold Rush brought a wave of prospectors to the Yukon. The Mackenzie River was one of the main routes into the northern interior, with sternwheelers transporting passengers, domestic supplies and industrial goods from as far upstream as the Athabasca River all the way to the delta, though with several areas such as the huge rapids on the Slave River requiring portages. The route taken by gold seekers started in Edmonton and followed the Athabasca, Slave and Mackenzie Rivers as far as the Peel River, then up the Peel and its tributary the Rat River to the headwaters of the Porcupine River, which flows to the Yukon River. Many who attempted the journey died along the way or turned back before reaching the Yukon.

Oil was discovered at Norman Wells in the 1920s, beginning a period of industrialization in the Mackenzie valley. Oil was initially shipped out by steamboats, supplying mines and towns across the NWT. This demand grew when gold was discovered on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, leading to the settlement of Yellowknife and the opening of several mines in the area. By the 1940s steamboats had been replaced by modern gas and diesel-powered craft, which continue to serve the river today. During World War II oil pumped in Norman Wells was shipped to Fairbanks, Alaska via the Canol pipeline. The pipeline was considered a &quot;fiasco&quot;, going five times over budget and losing as much as 20 percent of the oil due to poor construction. It only operated for thirteen months, shutting down in 1945. Much abandoned equipment remains along the corridor today; part of the pipeline route has been designated the Canol Heritage Trail. In 1964 the Mackenzie Northern Railway (now a subsidiary of CN) reached the shore of Great Slave Lake, to serve the new Pine Point zinc mine near Hay River. Although the mine shut down in 1988, the railroad remains an important transportation link between the Mackenzie River waterway and the rest of Canada.
In the 1950s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed the North American Water and Power Alliance (NAWAPA), a vast series of dams, tunnels and reservoirs designed to move of water from northern Canada to southern Canada, the western United States and Mexico. The system would involve building massive dams on the Liard, Mackenzie, Peace, Columbia, and Fraser river systems and pumping water into a long reservoir in the Rocky Mountain Trench. The water would then flow by gravity to irrigate more than in the three countries and generate more than 50,000 MW of surplus energy. The projects were never built due to the massive cost and environmental impact.

The Royal Canadian Mint honoured the 200th anniversary of the naming of the Mackenzie River with the issue of a silver commemorative dollar in 1989.

In 1997, a cultural landscape along the section of the Mackenzie River at Tsiigehtchic was designated the Nagwichoonjik (Mackenzie River) National Historic Site of Canada due to its cultural, social and spiritual significance to the Gwichya Gwich&#x27;in.

In 2008, Canadian and Japanese researchers extracted a constant stream of natural gas from a test project at the Mallik methane hydrate field in the Mackenzie Delta. This was the second such drilling at Mallik: the first took place in 2002 and used heat to release methane. In the 2008 experiment, researchers were able to extract gas by lowering the pressure, without heating, requiring significantly less energy. The Mallik gas hydrate field was first discovered by Imperial Oil in 1971–1972.

==Human use==

As of 2001, approximately 400,000 people lived in the Mackenzie River basin — representing only one percent of Canada&#x27;s population. Ninety percent of the population lived in the Peace and Athabasca River basins, mostly in Alberta. The cold northern permafrost regions beyond the Arctic Circle are very sparsely populated, mainly by Indigenous peoples. Most of the Mackenzie watershed is unbroken wilderness and human activities have little influence on the overall water quality, although there are some localized impacts.

===Natural resources===
Some parts of the Mackenzie basin are rich in natural resources – oil and gas in the Northwest Territories and in central Alberta, lumber in the Peace River headwaters, uranium in Saskatchewan, gold and zinc in the Great Slave Lake area and tungsten in the Yukon. As of 2003 there were two operational gold mines in Yellowknife, and many more abandoned mines dot the region. Communities along the Mackenzie River depend on subsistence fishing, although there is also some commercial fishing on the river.

Agriculture in the Mackenzie River basin is mainly concentrated in the Peace and Athabasca valleys to the south. The valley of the former river is considered to be some of the best northern farmland in Canada, due to the high concentration of minerals found in the soil. These conditions are expected to be improved even more by trends in climate change, such as warmer temperatures and a longer growing season. According to the British Columbia Environmental Network, &quot;there is enough agricultural capability in the Peace River Valley to provide vegetables to all of northern Canada&quot;.

The only functioning oil pipeline in the Mackenzie basin connects Norman Wells with Zama City, Alberta. Norman Wells was the main oil-producing area on the Mackenzie River until the 1970s, when new oil fields were discovered further north in the Mackenzie delta and the surrounding coastline. As of 2016, there were an estimated 166 billion barrels of oil reserves in this region. There is a proposal for a Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, which has not been built due to environmental concerns and falling oil and gas prices.

===Transportation===
During the ice-free season, the Mackenzie is a major transportation link through the vast wilderness of northern Canada, linking the many isolated communities along its course. Wide, calm sections of the river are frequently used to land seaplanes in the ice-free season. Canada&#x27;s northernmost major railhead is located at the town of Hay River, on the south shore of Great Slave Lake. Goods shipped there by train and truck are loaded onto barges of the government-owned Marine Transportation Services. In 2016, Northern Transportation Company went bankrupt, and its assets were bought by the government of Northwest Territories.

Barge traffic travels the entire length of the Mackenzie in long &quot;trains&quot; of up to fifteen shallow-draft vessels pulled by tugboats. Goods are shipped as far as the port of Tuktoyaktuk on the eastern end of the Mackenzie Delta, where they are transferred to oceangoing vessels and delivered to communities along Canada&#x27;s Arctic coast and the numerous islands to the north. In winter, the frozen channel of the Mackenzie River, especially in the delta region, is used as an ice road, firm enough to support large trucks, although travel between northern communities is mostly by dog sleds and snowmobiles.

Although the Mackenzie River is wide and deep, navigation is &quot;notoriously difficult&quot; due to the locations of sandbars and shallows changing from year to year. In some narrower parts of the river, barges must be uncoupled and towed one by one through hazardous stretches, despite attempts to widen and deepening the channel by blasting.

===Hydroelectricity===

Although there are no dams along the main stem of the Mackenzie, many of its tributaries and headwaters have been developed for hydroelectricity production, flood control and irrigation. The W.A.C. Bennett and Peace Canyon hydroelectric dams on the upper Peace River were completed in 1968 and 1980 by BC Hydro. They have a combined capacity of more than 3,600 megawatts (MW). The reservoir of W.A.C. Bennett, Williston Lake, is the largest body of fresh water in BC and the ninth largest man-made lake in the world, with a volume of . Other smaller hydroelectric plants are located along the Snare and Taltson River tributaries, providing power to mines in the Great Slave Lake region.

By acting as a massive stabilizer on the water flow of the Peace River, Williston Lake reduces flood crests on the Peace, Slave and Mackenzie rivers as far downstream as Fort Good Hope. This has made the Peace Valley more suitable for farming, but has had significant impacts on downstream wildlife and riparian communities. The more stable annual flow slows down the spread of essential nutrients which builds up in the form of sediments, thus causing the river to become more polluted.

There have been many proposals to dam the tributaries of the Mackenzie River which would lead to further impacts on water quality and seasonal flow patterns. A potential US$1 billion, 1350 MW hydro plant on the Slave River was canceled in 2010 after an agreement could not be reached with First Nations people in the area to be flooded by the reservoir. The Site C Dam on the Peace River, which would generate enough power for about 460,000 households, has been controversial since the 1970s. As of April 2019, despite multiple legal challenges by First Nations and environmental groups the dam was under construction, with a completion date scheduled for 2024.

<text>Ampex Data Systems Corporation is an American electronics company founded in 1944 by Alexander M. Poniatoff as a spin-off of Dalmo-Victor. The name &quot;AMPEX&quot; is an acronym, created by its founder, which stands for Alexander M. Poniatoff Excellence. Ampex operates as Ampex Data Systems Corporation, a subsidiary of Delta Information Systems, and consists of two business units. The Silicon Valley unit, known internally as Ampex Data Systems (ADS), manufactures digital data storage systems capable of functioning in harsh environments. The Colorado Springs, Colorado, unit, referred to as Ampex Intelligent Systems (AIS), serves as a laboratory and hub for the company&#x27;s line of industrial control systems, cyber security products and services and its artificial intelligence/machine learning technology.

Ampex&#x27;s first great success was a line of reel-to-reel tape recorders developed from the German wartime Magnetophon system at the behest of Bing Crosby. Ampex quickly became a leader in audio tape technology, developing many of the analog recording formats for both music and movies that remained in use into the 1990s. Starting in the 1950s, the company began developing video tape recorders, and later introduced the helical scan concept that made home video players possible. They also introduced multi-track recording, slow-motion and instant playback television, and a host of other advances. Ampex&#x27;s tape business was rendered obsolete during the 1990s, and the company turned to digital storage products.

Ampex moved into digital storage for DoD Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) with the introduction of the first, true all digital flight test recorder. Ampex supports numerous major DoD programs with the US Air Force, US Army, US Marines, US Navy and other government entities (NASA, DHS and national labs). Ampex also works with all major DoD primes and integrators including Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and many others.

Currently, Ampex is attempting to do more with the data stored on its network attached storage (NAS) devices. This includes adding encryption for secure data storage; algorithms focused on control system cyber security for infrastructure and aerospace platforms; and artificial intelligence/machine learning for automated entity identification and data analytics.

== Origin ==
Russian–American inventor Alexander Matthew Poniatoff established the company in San Carlos, California, in 1944 as the Ampex Electric and Manufacturing Company. The company name came from his initials plus &quot;ex&quot; to avoid using the name AMP already in use (by Aircraft and Marine Products). During World War II, Ampex was a subcontractor to Dalmo-Victor, manufacturing high quality electric motors and generators for radars that used alnico 5 magnets from General Electric. Ampex was initially set up in an abandoned loft-space above the Dalmo-Victor plant; eventually they would have offices at 1313 Laurel Street, San Carlos, California (at the intersection of Howard Avenue and Laurel Street).

Near the end of the war, while serving in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, Major Jack Mullin was assigned to investigate German radio and electronics experiments. He discovered the Magnetophons with AC biasing on a trip to Radio Frankfurt. The device produced much better fidelity than shellac records. The technological processes in tape recording and equipment developed by German companies before and during the 1939–1945 war were subject to patents which were effectively voided after Germany&#x27;s 1945 surrender and defeat. Mullin acquired two Magnetophon recorders and 50 reels of BASF Type L tape, and brought them to America, where he produced modified versions. He demonstrated them to the Institute of Radio Engineers in San Francisco on May 16, 1946.

Bing Crosby, a big star on radio at the time, was receptive to the idea of pre-recording his radio programs. He disliked the regimentation of live broadcasts, and much preferred the relaxed atmosphere of the recording studio. He had already asked the NBC network to let him pre-record his 1944–45 series on transcription discs, but the network refused; so Crosby had withdrawn from live radio for a year and returned (this time to the recently created ABC) for the 1946–47 season, only reluctantly.

In June 1947, Mullin, who was pitching the technology to the major Hollywood movie studios, got the chance to demonstrate his modified tape recorders to Crosby. When Crosby heard a demonstration of Mullin&#x27;s tape recorders, he immediately saw the potential of the new technology and commissioned Mullin to prepare a test recording of his radio show. Ampex was finishing its prototype of the Model 200 tape recorder, and Mullin used the first two models as soon as they were built. After a successful test broadcast, ABC agreed to allow Crosby to pre-record his shows on tape. Crosby immediately appointed Mullin as his chief engineer and placed an order for $50,000 worth of the new recorders so that Ampex (then a small six-man concern) could develop a commercial production model from the prototypes.

Crosby Enterprises was Ampex&#x27;s West Coast representative until 1957.

== Early tape recorders ==

The company&#x27;s first tape recorder, the Ampex Model 200A, was first shipped in April 1948. The first two units, serial numbers 1 and 2, were used to record Bing Crosby&#x27;s show. The American Broadcasting Company used these recorders along with 3M Scotch 111 gamma ferric oxide coated acetate tape for the first-ever U.S. delayed radio broadcast of Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Philco Radio Time&quot;. Ampex tape recorders revolutionized the radio and recording industries because of their superior audio quality and ease of operation over audio disk cutting lathes.

The firm&#x27;s earliest production of multichannel machines wasn&#x27;t aimed at music recording; it noted in 195354 that &quot;Ampex began the commercial production of multitrack tape recorders about four years ago for those interested in telemetered information from guided missiles and the like. These equipments provided any number of simultaneous channels up to 14. It was a simple step, therefore, to make stereophonic tape recorders with two or more channels.&quot; 

During the early 1950s, Ampex began marketing one- and two-track machines using tape. In May 1953 the firm announced production of two- and three-track machines on 1/4 inch tape. The line soon expanded into three- and four-track models using tape. In the early 1950s, Ampex moved to Redwood City, California. Ampex acquired Orradio Industries in 1959, which became the Ampex Magnetic Tape Division, headquartered in Opelika, Alabama. This made Ampex a manufacturer of both recorders and tape. By the end of that decade Ampex products were much in demand by top recording studios worldwide.

In 1952, movie producer Mike Todd asked Ampex to develop a high-fidelity movie sound system using sound magnetically recorded on the film itself, as contrasted with the technology of the time, which used magnetic tracks on a separate celluloid base film (later commonly known as mag stock). The result of this development was the CinemaScope/Todd-AO motion picture sound system, which was first used in movies such as &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953) in 35mm and &quot;Oklahoma&quot; (1955) in 70mm (and also in 35mm). In 1960, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Ampex an Oscar for technical achievement as a result of this development.

Les Paul, a friend of Crosby and a regular guest on his shows, had already been experimenting with overdubbed recordings on disc. He received an early portable Ampex Model 300 from Crosby. Using this machine, Les Paul invented &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; recording technology. He placed an additional playback head, located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads. This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track, both of which were mixed together on to a new track. This was a destructive process because the original recording was recorded over. 

For Operation Gold in Berlin 1955-56, 150 Ampex tape recorders in the warehouse operations centre were used to record intercepted Soviet telephone calls and teletype messages.

==Professional 8-track recorders==

Ampex built a handful of multitrack machines during the late 1950s that could record as many as eight tracks on tape. The project was overseen by Ross Snyder, Ampex manager of special products. To make the multitrack recorder work, Snyder invented the Sel-Sync process, which used some tracks on the head for playback and other tracks on the head for recording. This made the newly recorded material be in sync with the existing recorded tracks. The first of these machines cost $10,000 and was installed in Les Paul&#x27;s home recording studio by David Sarser.

In 1967, Ampex responded to demand by stepping up production of their 8-track machines with the production model MM 1000. Like earlier 8-track machines of this era, it used 1-inch tape.

==16 and 24-track recorders==
In 1966, Ampex built their first 16-track recorder, the model AG-1000, at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City. In 1967, Ampex introduced a 16-track version of the MM 1000 which was the world&#x27;s first 16-track professional tape recorder put into mass-production. Both used a tape transport design adapted from the video recording division. The 16-track MM-1000 quickly became legendary for its tremendous flexibility, reliability and outstanding sound quality. This brought about the &quot;golden age&quot; of large format analog multitrack recorders which would last into the mid-1990s. MCI built the first 24-track recorder (using 2-inch tape) in 1968 which was installed at TTG Studios in Los Angeles. Later machines built by Ampex starting in 1969 would have as many as 24 tracks on 2 inch tape. In addition to this, the introduction of SMPTE time code allowed studios to run multiple machines in perfect synchronization, making the number of available tracks virtually unlimited.

By the 1970s, Ampex faced tough competition from the Swiss company Studer and Japanese manufacturers such as Otari and Sony (who also purchased the MCI brand in 1982). In 1979, Ampex introduced their most advanced 24-track recorder, the model ATR-124. The ATR-124 was ruggedly constructed and had audio specifications that nearly rivaled the first digital recording machines. However, sales of the ATR-124 were slow due to the machine&#x27;s high price tag. Ampex sold only about 50 or 60 ATR-124 machines and withdrew from the professional audio tape recorder market entirely in 1983.

==The 1990s==
By the 1990s Ampex focused more on video recorders, instrumentation recorders, and data recorders. In 1991, Ampex sold their professional audio recorder line to Sprague Magnetics. The Ampex Recording Media Corporation spun off in 1995 as Quantegy Inc.; that company has ceased producing recording tape.

== Video technology ==

=== Video processing ===

While AMPEX are well recognized for their contribution to magnetic tape recording, they also had a huge impact on developments the whole video signal chain.
They did rebadge some specialist low-volume OEM products to complete the package, but their in-house teams developed industry leading products in the following categories:

=== Digital optics ===
ADO Ampex Digital Optics provided comprehensive frame manipulation in 2 and 3 dimensions. Adjusting the aspect, size, and rotation of the image was performed continuously in real-time. An optional digital &#x27;combiner&#x27; was available to perform the foreground layering and priority switching – to reduce the burden on the vision mixer with multi-channel effects.

=== Video switching and effects ===
AVC – The AVC range of vision mixers ranged from small, single buss devices up to the high-end Century Series, with multiple Mix/Effect busses, infinite re-entry and powerful keying and control software.

=== Editing controllers ===
The product line evolved quickly from manual editing on the actual VTRs themselves to incorporate SMPTE timecode providing advanced timeline control.
The RA-4000 and EDM-1 were fully functional early products, but soon evolved to the extremely powerful ACE family to compete with CMX and other edit controller brands.

=== Quadruplex two-inch tape===

Starting in the early 1950s, RCA, Bing Crosby and others tried to record analog video on very fast-moving magnetic tape. As early as 1952, Ampex developed prototype video tape recorders that used a spinning head and relatively slow-moving tape. In early 1956, a team produced the first videotape recorder. A young, 19-year-old engineer Ray Dolby was also part of the team. Ampex demonstrated the VR-1000, which was the first of Ampex&#x27;s line of 2-inch Quadruplex videotape recorders on April 14, 1956, at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago. The first magnetically recorded time-delayed television network program using the new Ampex Quadruplex recording system was CBS&#x27;s &quot;Douglas Edwards and the News&quot; on November 30, 1956.

The &quot;Quad&quot; head assembly rotates at 14,400 rpm (NTSC). The four head pieces (quad) are switched successively so that recorded stripes cross the video portion (most of the tape middle, audio is on one edge, control track is on the other) so that head to tape write speed is well in excess of the physical motion. They wrote the video vertically across the width of a tape that was wide and ran at per second. This allowed hour-long television programs to be recorded on one reel of tape. In 1956, one reel of tape cost $300; and Ampex advertised the cost of the recorder as $45,000. A version was released later, and this required a new, narrower headwheel. This vertical writing facilitated mechanical editing, once the control track was developed to display the pulse that indicates where a frame ends and the next one begins. Later, Ampex developed electronic editing.

The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded Ampex its first Emmy in 1957 for this development. Ampex received a total of 12 Emmys for its technical video achievements.

In 1959, Richard Nixon, then Vice President, and Nikita Khrushchev held discussions at the Moscow Trade Fair, which became known as the &quot;Kitchen Debate&quot; because they were mostly held in the kitchen of a suburban model house. These discussions were recorded on an Ampex color videotape recorder, and during the debate Nixon pointed this out as one of the many American technological advances.
In 1967, Ampex introduced the Ampex VR-3000 portable broadcast video recorder, which revolutionized the recording of broadcast quality television in the field without the need for long cables and large support vehicles. Broadcast quality images could now be shot anywhere, including from airplanes, helicopters and boats.

The Quadruplex format dominated the broadcast industry for a quarter of a century. The format was licensed to RCA for use in their &quot;television tape recorders.&quot; Ampex&#x27;s invention revolutionized the television production industry by eliminating the kinescope process of time-shifting television programs, which required the use of motion picture film. For archival purposes, the kinescope method continued to be used for some years; film was still preferred by archivists. The Ampex broadcast video tape recorder facilitated time-zone broadcast delay so that networks could air programming at the same hour in various time zones. Ampex had trademarked the name &quot;video tape&quot;, so competitor RCA called the medium &quot;TV tape&quot; or &quot;television tape&quot;. The terms eventually became genericized, and &quot;videotape&quot; is commonly used today.

While the quadruplex recording system per se is no longer in use, the principle evolved into the helical scanning technique used in virtually all video tape machines, such as those using the consumer formats of VHS, Sony Betamax and Video 2000. Sony Betacam was successful as a professional format but operated with a different recording system and faster tape speed than Betamax.

One of the key engineers in the development of the Quadruplex video recorder for Ampex was Ray Dolby, who worked under Charlie Ginsburg and went on to form Dolby Laboratories, a pioneer in audio noise reduction systems. Dolby&#x27;s contribution to the videotape system was limited to the mathematics behind the reactance tube FM modulator, as videotape then used FM modulation for the video portion. Another contributor designed the FM modulator itself. Dolby left Ampex to seek a PhD in physics in England, which is where Dolby Labs was later founded, before moving back to San Francisco. Dolby&#x27;s brother Dale was also an engineer at Ampex.

=== VR-5000 and VR-8000 ===
In 1961, Ampex introduced the first 1-inch helical scan video recorders, the Ampex 2-inch helical VTRs, which recorded video using helical scan recording technology on tape.

=== Ampex 2-inch helical VTR ===

Ampex 2 inch helical VTRs were manufactured from 1963 to 1970. Model VR-1500 for home. The VR-660 for Broadcast television systems, industrial companies, educational institutions, and a few for In-flight entertainment. The VR-1500 and VR-660 found service at educational institutions especially due to their relatively low cost vs. quadruplex VTRs. These machines were simple to operate, reliable, small in size—and produced, for their time, very good video without the complexity of the larger and much more complex 2&quot; Quad machines.

=== HS-100 and HS-200 &quot;slo-mo&quot; disc recorder ===
In March 1967, Ampex introduced the HS-100 video disc recorder. The system was developed by Ampex at the request of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) for a variety of sports broadcast uses. It was first demonstrated on the air on March 18, 1967, when ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; televised the &quot;World Series of Skiing&quot; from Vail, Colorado. The video was recorded on analog magnetic disc. The disc weighed and rotated at 60 rps, 3600 rpm (50 rps in PAL). One NTSC unit could record 30 seconds of video, PAL units 36 seconds. The video could then be played back in slow motion, stop action to freeze frame.

A more deluxe version, the HS-200, was introduced in April 1968, and provided a large control console with variable speed playback. This made it ideal for instant replay for sports events and precise timing control in post-production service. CBS-TV was the first to use the technique during live sportscasts, though it was quickly adopted by all American TV networks. The HS-200, which was an HS-100 connected to a control console, had greater precise frame and timing control capability, lending itself to post-production applications like special effects and titles. The HS-200 had a frame accurate timing computer that enabled frame-accurate cuts and dissolve transitions by way of a two-input video switcher. Slow-motion sequences could likewise be programmed and could be &quot;triggered&quot; to begin via an external control pulse such as might come from an external VTR editor like the Ampex VR-2000 VTR with Editec. The HS-200 was the first system capable of single-frame video animation recording, using magnetic discs as opposed to videotape. The HS-200 also provided a readout with specific frame numbers showing from the 900 frames available (NTSC version). Sequences could be triggered to start from any of these 900 frames with frame-accurate repeatability for creative fine tuning of sequence start and end points.

=== Type A ===

1 inch type A videotape (designated Type A by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, SMPTE) was an open-reel helical scan videotape format developed by Ampex in 1965, one of the first standardized open-reel videotape formats in the width; most others of that size at that time were proprietary.

=== Type C ===

1 inch type C videotape (designated Type C by SMPTE) was a professional open-reel videotape format co-developed and introduced by Ampex and Sony in 1976. It became the replacement in the professional video and television broadcast industries for the then-incumbent Quadruplex.

=== D2 ===

D2 is a digital video tape format created by Ampex and other manufacturers (through a standards group of SMPTE) and introduced at the 1988 NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) convention as a lower-cost alternative to the D-1 format. Like D-1, D-2 video is uncompressed; however, it saves bandwidth and other costs by sampling a fully encoded NTSC or PAL composite video signal, and storing it directly to magnetic tape, rather than sampling component video. This is known as digital composite.

=== DCT and DST ===

Digital Component Technology (DCT) and Data Storage Technology (DST) are VTR and data storage devices respectively, created by Ampex in 1992. Both were similar to the D1 and D2 VTR formats, using a width, with the DCT format using DCT (discrete cosine transform) video compression, also its namesake.

The DCT and DST formats yielded relatively high capacity and speed for data and video. Double-density DST data storage was introduced in 1996. The final generation of these products were quad density, introduced in 2000, resulting in a large cartridge holding 660GB of data.

== Milestones ==
* In 1948, the first tape-delayed U.S. radio program was broadcast by using an Ampex Model 200 tape recorder.
* In May 1949 Model 300 introduced improvements in audio head, tape drive and tape path.
* In 1950, Model 400 introduced lower cost professional quality audio recorder, soon to be replaced by the Model 400A, which was the logical precursor of the Model 350.
* In 1950, Ampex introduced the first &quot;dedicated&quot; instrumentation recorder, Model 500, built for the U.S. Navy.
* In April 1953 Model 350 introduced audio recorder to replace the Model 400/Model 400A. The Model 350 had more simplicity and durability. Ampex released the 35 mm four-track CinemaScope stereo reproduction system.
* In May 1954 Model 600 introduced mastering quality audio portable recorder. Models 3200-3300 high-speed duplicators also introduced.
* In 1954, in a recording studio equipped with an Ampex reel-to-reel audio tape recording machine, an unknown truck driver named Elvis Presley recorded his historic first single, &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; at Sun Studios in Memphis. Also that year, Ampex introduced the first multi-track audio recorder derived from multi-track data recording technology.
* In 1955, Ampex released the 70 mm and 35 mm six-track and four-track Todd-AO system, and an improved 35mm four-track system.
* On March 14, 1956, The Ampex VRX-1000 (later renamed the Mark IV) videotape recorder is introduced at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago. This is the first practical videotape recorder and is hailed as a major technological breakthrough. CBS goes on air with the first videotape delayed broadcast, Douglas Edwards and The News, on November 30, 1956, from Los Angeles, California, using the Ampex Mark IV.
* In March 1957, Ampex won an Emmy award for the invention of the Video Tape Recorder (VTR).
* In 1958, NASA selected Ampex data recorders and magnetic tape. It has been used for virtually all U.S. space missions since.
* In 1959, the Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate was recorded on Ampex videotape. The fact that the debate was being videotaped was mentioned by Nixon as an example of American technological development.
* In 1960, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Ampex with an Oscar for technical achievement.
* January 1961 Helical scan recording was invented by Ampex. The technology behind the worldwide consumer video revolution, it is used in all home video tape recorders.
* In 1963, Ampex technology was used to show replays of the live assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald.
* In 1963, Ampex introduced EDITEC, electronic video editing, allowing broadcast television editors frame-by-frame recording control, simplifying tape editing and the ability to make animation effects possible. This was the basis for all subsequent editing systems.
* On December 7, 1963 – Instant Replay is used for the first time during the live transmission of the Army Navy Game by its inventor, director, Tony Verna.
* In April 1964, Ampex introduced the VR-2000 high band videotape recorder, the first ever to be capable of color fidelity required for high quality color broadcasting.
* February 1965 – introduced VR-303 and VR-7000 closed-circuit video tape recorder.
* May 1965 – introduced AG-350 first all-transistorized audio recorder.
* July 1965 – introduced VR-660B VTR advanced version of VR-660; replaces VR-660 and VR-1500.
* November 1965 – introduced VR-7000 compact portable closed circuit video tape recorder.
* During 1966–1967, Ampex FR-900 data drives were used to record the first images of the Earth from the Moon, as part of the Lunar Orbiter program. Two drives were refurbished to recover the images as part of the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP).

* In 1967, ABC used the Ampex HS-100 disk recorder for slow-motion playback of downhill skiing on the program &quot;World Series of Skiing&quot; in Vail, Colorado. This was the first use of slow-motion instant replay in sporting events.
* In 1968, the introduction of the Ampex VR-3000 revolutionizes video recording: the first truly portable VTR. It is used at the &#x27;68 Summer Olympics in Mexico City to follow the world&#x27;s cross-country runners for the first time in Broadcast history.
* In 1969, Ampex introduced Videofile, still in use at Scotland Yard for the electronic storage and retrieval of fingerprints.
* In 1972, Ampex introduced the ACR-25, the first automated robotic library system for the recording and playback of television commercials. Each commercial was recorded on an individual cartridge. These cartridges were then loaded into a large rotating carousel. Using sophisticated mechanics and vacuum pneumatics, the &quot;carts&quot; were loaded into and extracted from the machine with an 8-second cycle time for spots under 61 seconds. This freed TV stations from loading individual machines with spots in real time, or preparing spot reels in advance of a broadcast. The TV newsroom also began to use the ACR-25 to run news stories because of its random-access capability. The ACR-25 used AVR-1 signal, servo, and timebase systems, and a machine-programming control bay designed by Ampex engineer E. Stanley Busby. Both machines had a lockup time of 200 milliseconds, as distinct from the industry standard 5 second pre-roll. This was accomplished with optical-vacuum reel servos providing the vacuum capstan negligible inertial mass to control, and predictive digital servos that could re-frame vertically at horizontal rate, as well as timebase correction with a window exceeding 64 microseconds (compared to the VR-2000&#x27;s window of less than 5 microseconds).
* Also in 1970, Ampex started its own record label, Ampex Records. Its biggest hit was &quot;We Gotta Get You A Woman&quot; by Todd Rundgren (as &quot;Runt&quot;), reaching No. 20 on the charts in 1970.
* In 1978, the Ampex Video Art (AVA) video graphics system is used by artist LeRoy Neiman on air during Super Bowl XII. AVA, the first video paint system, allows the graphic artist, using an electronic pen, to illustrate in a new medium, video. This innovation paved the way for high quality electronic graphics, such as those used in video games.
* In 1982, Ampex introduced DST (high-performance computer mass storage products able to store half the Library of Congress in of floor space) and DCT, the first digital component postproduction system using image compression technology to produce high quality images.
* In 1983, Ampex introduced the DCRS digital cassette recorder, offering compact cassette storage with the equivalent of 16 digital or 8 DDR instrumentation reels on one cassette. Also, Partial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) data decoding technology has its first use in Ampex&#x27;s DCRsi recorders. This technology is commonly used in high performance computer disk drives and other high density magnetic data storage devices.
* In 1985, Ampex introduced the DIS 120i and DIS 160i dual port, data/instrumentation recorders. These made it possible for the first time to capture real time instrumentation data and then utilize the same recorder to process the data in a computer environment through its second port using SCSI-2 protocol.
* In 2005, Ampex received its 12th Emmy award for its invention of slow-motion color recording and playback. Also honored with Lifetime Achievement Awards were the members of the engineering team that created the videotape recorder when they worked for Ampex: Charles Andersen, Ray Dolby, Shelby Henderson, Fred Pfost, and the late Charles Ginsburg and Alex Maxey.

== Sticky-shed syndrome ==

Some master tapes and other recordings predominantly from the 1970s and 1980s have degraded due to the so-called sticky-shed syndrome. When sticky-shed syndrome occurs, the binding agent deteriorates, resulting in the magnetic coating coming off the base and either sticking to the backing of the tape layer wound on top of it (resulting in dropout), or being scraped off and deposited on the tape heads while lifting the head off the tape, degrading the treble.

The problem has been reported on a number of makes of tape (usually back-coated tapes), including Ampex tapes.

Ampex filed for a baking process (&quot;A typical temperature used is and a typical time is 16 hours&quot;) to attempt to recover such tapes, allowing them to be played once more and the recordings transferred to new media. The problems have been reported on tapes of type 406/407, 456/457, 2020/373.

== Branding ==
* In 1959, Ampex acquired Orradio Industries and it became the Ampex Magnetic Tape Division.
* In 1995, Ampex divested this division, then called the Ampex Recording Media Corporation. This became Quantegy, Inc., which later changed its name to the current Quantegy Recording Solutions.
* In January 2005, having previously filed for bankruptcy protection, Quantegy closed its manufacturing facility in Opelika.
* In October 2014, Ampex Data Systems Corporation was sold to Delta Information Systems, but retains the rights to the Ampex name.
*In 2017, Ampex established a second business unit, Ampex Intelligent Systems (AIS), in Colorado Springs Colorado, and branded its Silicon Valley business unit Ampex Data Systems (ADS).

== Record labels ==
Ampex Records was started in 1970. Its biggest hit was &quot;We Gotta Get You A Woman&quot; by Todd Rundgren (as &quot;Runt&quot;), reaching No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1970. Ampex also originated three subsidiary labels: Bearsville, Big Tree, and Lizard. Ampex Records ceased operations around 1973; Bearsville and Big Tree switched distribution respectively to Warner Bros. Records and Bell Records, and Lizard became an independent entity. Later on, Big Tree was picked up by Atlantic Records.

== Legal history ==
In 2005, iNEXTV, a wholly owned subsidiary of respondent Ampex Corporation, brought a defamation lawsuit against a poster on an Internet message board who posted messages critical of them (Ampex Corp. v. Cargle (2005), Cal.App.4th). The poster, a former employee, responded with an anti-SLAPP suit and eventually recovered his attorney fees. The case was unique in that it involved the legality of speech in an electronic public forum.

== Present Day -- Since 2014 ==
After becoming part of Delta Information Systems in 2014, two former subsidiaries of Ampex Corporation continued business as part of the Ampex legacy. Ampex Data Systems Corporation (ADSC) headquartered in Silicon Valley, and its subsidiary, Ampex Japan Ltd. are the only two Ampex businesses that still trade as more than &quot;in name only&quot; entities.

Ampex Data Systems operates out of main three locations in the USA: the headquarters in Hayward, CA (about a dozen miles from the Redwood City location in Silicon Valley), a program office in Colorado Springs, CO and an engineering center in Las Cruces, NM, as well as from the main Delta HQ in Horsham, PA. Ampex continues to produce rugged data storage products used by government, military and commercial customers world-wide.

Since joining Delta, Ampex has grown in revenue and headcount, employing significantly more people in 2023 than were employed under the previous management structure.

== Legacy and Archives ==

The Ampex video system is obsolete, but many thousands of quadruplex videotape recordings remain. Machines that survive are used to transfer archival recordings to modern digital video formats.

Ampex Corporation supported the Ampex Museum of Magnetic Recording, started by Peter Hammar in 1982.

The contents of that museum were donated to Stanford in 2001. A project is underway to curate Ampex artifacts in physical and digital form. This project will find a permanent home in Redwood City for the Ampex Museum and digital artifacts will be curated at AmpexMuseum.org This project is being funded by contributions from former Ampex employees.

<text>In computer science, the treap and the randomized binary search tree are two closely related forms of binary search tree data structures that maintain a dynamic set of ordered keys and allow binary searches among the keys. After any sequence of insertions and deletions of keys, the shape of the tree is a random variable with the same probability distribution as a random binary tree; in particular, with high probability its height is proportional to the logarithm of the number of keys, so that each search, insertion, or deletion operation takes logarithmic time to perform.

== Description ==

The treap was first described by Raimund Seidel and Cecilia R. Aragon in 1989; its name is a portmanteau of tree and heap.
It is a Cartesian tree in which each key is given a (randomly chosen) numeric priority. As with any binary search tree, the inorder traversal order of the nodes is the same as the sorted order of the keys. The structure of the tree is determined by the requirement that it be heap-ordered: that is, the priority number for any non-leaf node must be greater than or equal to the priority of its children. Thus, as with Cartesian trees more generally, the root node is the maximum-priority node, and its left and right subtrees are formed in the same manner from the subsequences of the sorted order to the left and right of that node.

An equivalent way of describing the treap is that it could be formed by inserting the nodes highest priority-first into a binary search tree without doing any rebalancing. Therefore, if the priorities are independent random numbers (from a distribution over a large enough space of possible priorities to ensure that two nodes are very unlikely to have the same priority) then the shape of a treap has the same probability distribution as the shape of a random binary search tree, a search tree formed by inserting the nodes without rebalancing in a randomly chosen insertion order. Because random binary search trees are known to have logarithmic height with high probability, the same is true for treaps. This mirrors the binary search tree argument that quicksort runs in expected formula_1 time. If binary search trees are solutions to the dynamic problem version of sorting, then Treaps correspond specifically to dynamic quicksort where priorities guide pivot choices.

Aragon and Seidel also suggest assigning higher priorities to frequently accessed nodes, for instance by a process that, on each access, chooses a random number and replaces the priority of the node with that number if it is higher than the previous priority. This modification would cause the tree to lose its random shape; instead, frequently accessed nodes would be more likely to be near the root of the tree, causing searches for them to be faster.

Naor and Nissim describe an application in maintaining authorization certificates in public-key cryptosystems.

== Operations ==

=== Basic operations ===
Treaps support the following basic operations:

*To search for a given key value, apply a standard binary search algorithm in a binary search tree, ignoring the priorities.
*To insert a new key &quot;x&quot; into the treap, generate a random priority &quot;y&quot; for &quot;x&quot;. Binary search for &quot;x&quot; in the tree, and create a new node at the leaf position where the binary search determines a node for &quot;x&quot; should exist. Then, as long as &quot;x&quot; is not the root of the tree and has a larger priority number than its parent &quot;z&quot;, perform a tree rotation that reverses the parent-child relation between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot;.
*To delete a node &quot;x&quot; from the treap, if &quot;x&quot; is a leaf of the tree, simply remove it. If &quot;x&quot; has a single child &quot;z&quot;, remove &quot;x&quot; from the tree and make &quot;z&quot; be the child of the parent of &quot;x&quot; (or make &quot;z&quot; the root of the tree if &quot;x&quot; had no parent). Finally, if &quot;x&quot; has two children, swap its position in the tree with the position of its immediate successor &quot;z&quot; in the sorted order, resulting in one of the previous cases. In this final case, the swap may violate the heap-ordering property for &quot;z&quot;, so additional rotations may need to be performed to restore this property.

=== Building a treap ===

* To build a treap we can simply insert n values in the treap where each takes formula_2 time. Therefore a treap can be built in formula_1 time from a list values.

===Bulk operations===
In addition to the single-element insert, delete and lookup operations, several fast &quot;bulk&quot; operations have been defined on treaps: union, intersection and set difference. These rely on two helper operations, &quot;split&quot; and &quot;join&quot;.

*To split a treap into two smaller treaps, those smaller than key &quot;x&quot;, and those larger than key &quot;x&quot;, insert &quot;x&quot; into the treap with maximum priority—larger than the priority of any node in the treap. After this insertion, &quot;x&quot; will be the root node of the treap, all values less than &quot;x&quot; will be found in the left subtreap, and all values greater than &quot;x&quot; will be found in the right subtreap. This costs as much as a single insertion into the treap.
*Joining two treaps that are the product of a former split, one can safely assume that the greatest value in the first treap is less than the smallest value in the second treap. Create a new node with value &quot;x&quot;, such that &quot;x&quot; is larger than this max-value in the first treap and smaller than the min-value in the second treap, assign it the minimum priority, then set its left child to the first heap and its right child to the second heap. Rotate as necessary to fix the heap order. After that, it will be a leaf node, and can easily be deleted. The result is one treap merged from the two original treaps. This is effectively &quot;undoing&quot; a split, and costs the same. More generally, the join operation can work on two treaps and a key with arbitrary priority (i.e., not necessary to be the highest).

The join algorithm is as follows:

 function join(L, k, R)
 if prior(k, k(L)) and prior(k, k(R)) return Node(L, k, R)
 if prior(k(L), k(R)) return Node(left(L), k(L), join(right(L), k, R))
 return Node(join(L, k, left(R)), k(R), right(R))

The split algorithm is as follows:

 function split(T, k)
 if (T = nil) return (nil, false, nil)
 (L, (m, c), R) = expose(T)
 if (k = m) return (L, true, R)
 if (k &lt; m) 
 (L&#x27;, b, R&#x27;) = split(L, k)
 return (L&#x27;, b, join(R&#x27;, m, R))
 if (k &gt; m) 
 (L&#x27;, b, R&#x27;) = split(R, k)
 return (join(L, m, L&#x27;), b, R&#x27;))

The union of two treaps and , representing sets and is a treap that represents . The following recursive algorithm computes the union:

 function union(t1, t2):
 if t1 = nil:
 return t2
 if t2 = nil:
 return t1
 if priority(t1) &lt; priority(t2):
 swap t1 and t2
 t&lt;, t&gt; ← split t2 on key(t1)
 return join(union(left(t1), t&lt;), key(t1),
 union(right(t1), t&gt;))

Here, &quot;split&quot; is presumed to return two trees: one holding the keys less than its input key, one holding the greater keys. (The algorithm is non-destructive, but an in-place destructive version exists as well.)

The algorithm for intersection is similar, but requires the &quot;join&quot; helper routine. The complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is for treaps of sizes and , with . Moreover, since the recursive calls to union are independent of each other, they can be executed in parallel. 

Split and Union call Join but do not deal with the balancing criteria of treaps directly, such an implementation is usually called the &quot;join-based&quot; implementation.

Note that if hash values of keys are used as priorities and structurally equal nodes are merged already at construction, then each merged node will be a unique representation of a set of keys. Provided that there can only be one simultaneous root node representing a given set of keys, two sets can be tested for equality by pointer comparison, which is constant in time.

This technique can be used to enhance the merge algorithms to perform fast also when the difference between two sets is small. If input sets are equal, the union and intersection functions could break immediately returning one of the input sets as result, while the difference function should return the empty set.

Let be the size of the symmetric difference. The modified merge algorithms will then also be bounded by .

==Randomized binary search tree==
The randomized binary search tree, introduced by Martínez and Roura subsequently to the work of Aragon and Seidel on treaps, stores the same nodes with the same random distribution of tree shape, but maintains different information within the nodes of the tree in order to maintain its randomized structure.

Rather than storing random priorities on each node, the randomized binary search tree stores a small integer at each node, the number of its descendants (counting itself as one); these numbers may be maintained during tree rotation operations at only a constant additional amount of time per rotation. When a key &quot;x&quot; is to be inserted into a tree that already has &quot;n&quot; nodes, the insertion algorithm chooses with probability 1/(&quot;n&quot; + 1) to place &quot;x&quot; as the new root of the tree, and otherwise, it calls the insertion procedure recursively to insert &quot;x&quot; within the left or right subtree (depending on whether its key is less than or greater than the root). The numbers of descendants are used by the algorithm to calculate the necessary probabilities for the random choices at each step. Placing &quot;x&quot; at the root of a subtree may be performed either as in the treap by inserting it at a leaf and then rotating it upwards, or by an alternative algorithm described by Martínez and Roura that splits the subtree into two pieces to be used as the left and right children of the new node.

The deletion procedure for a randomized binary search tree uses the same information per node as the insertion procedure, but unlike the insertion procedure, it only needs on average O(1) random decisions to join the two subtrees descending from the left and right children of the deleted node into a single tree. That is because the subtrees to be joined are on average at depth Θ(log n); joining two trees of size n and m needs Θ(log(n+m)) random choices on average. If the left or right subtree of the node to be deleted is empty, the join operation is trivial; otherwise, the left or right child of the deleted node is selected as the new subtree root with probability proportional to its number of descendants, and the join proceeds recursively.

===Comparison===
The information stored per node in the randomized binary tree is simpler than in a treap (a small integer rather than a high-precision random number), but it makes a greater number of calls to the random number generator (O(log &quot;n&quot;) calls per insertion or deletion rather than one call per insertion) and the insertion procedure is slightly more complicated due to the need to update the numbers of descendants per node. A minor technical difference is that, in a treap, there is a small probability of a collision (two keys getting the same priority), and in both cases, there will be statistical differences between a true random number generator and the pseudo-random number generator typically used on digital computers. However, in any case, the differences between the theoretical model of perfect random choices used to design the algorithm and the capabilities of actual random number generators are vanishingly small.

Although the treap and the randomized binary search tree both have the same random distribution of tree shapes after each update, the history of modifications to the trees performed by these two data structures over a sequence of insertion and deletion operations may be different. For instance, in a treap, if the three numbers 1, 2, and 3 are inserted in the order 1, 3, 2, and then the number 2 is deleted, the remaining two nodes will have the same parent-child relationship that they did prior to the insertion of the middle number. In a randomized binary search tree, the tree after the deletion is equally likely to be either of the two possible trees on its two nodes, independently of what the tree looked like prior to the insertion of the middle number.

== Implicit treap ==
An implicit treap is a simple variation of an ordinary treap which can be viewed as a dynamic array that supports the following operations in formula_2:

* Inserting an element in any position
* Removing an element from any position
* Finding sum, minimum or maximum element in a given range.
* Addition, painting in a given range
* Reversing elements in a given range 

The idea behind an implicit treap is to use the array index as a key, but to not store it explicitly. Otherwise, an update (insertion/deletion) would result in changes of the keys in formula_5 nodes of the tree. 

The key value (implicit key) of a node T is the number of nodes less than that node plus one. Note that such nodes can be present not only in its left subtree but also in left subtrees of its ancestors P, if T is in the right subtree of P.

Therefore we can quickly calculate the implicit key of the current node as we perform an operation by accumulating the sum of all nodes as we descend the tree. Note that this sum does not change when we visit the left subtree but it will increase by formula_6 when we visit the right subtree.

The join algorithm for an implicit treap is as follows:
void join (pitem &amp; t, pitem l, pitem r) {
 if (!l || !r)
 t = l ? l : r;
 else if (l-&gt;prior &gt; r-&gt;prior)
 join (l-&gt;r, l-&gt;r, r), t = l;
 else
 join (r-&gt;l, l, r-&gt;l), t = r;
 upd_cnt (t);


The split algorithm for an implicit treap is as follows:
void split (pitem t, pitem &amp; l, pitem &amp; r, int key, int add = 0) {
 if (!t)
 return void( l = r = 0 );
 int cur_key = add + cnt(t-&gt;l); //implicit key
 if (key &lt;= cur_key)
 split (t-&gt;l, l, t-&gt;l, key, add), r = t;
 else
 split (t-&gt;r, t-&gt;r, r, key, add + 1 + cnt(t-&gt;l)), l = t;
 upd_cnt (t);


=== Operations ===

==== Insert element ====
To insert an element at position &quot;pos&quot; we divide the array into two subsections &quot;[0...pos-1]&quot; and &quot;[pos..sz]&quot; by calling the split function and we get two trees formula_7 and formula_8 . Then we merge formula_7 with the new node by calling the join function. Finally we call the join function to merge formula_7 and formula_8.

==== Delete element ====
We find the element to be deleted and perform a join on its children L and R. We then replace the element to be deleted with the tree that resulted from the join operation. 

==== Find sum, minimum or maximum in a given range ====
To perform this calculation we will proceed as follows:

* First we will create an additional field F to store the value of the target function for the range represented by that node. we will create a function that calculates the value F based on the values of the L and R children of the node. We will call this target function at the end of all functions that modify the tree, &quot;i.e.&quot;, split and join. 
* Second we need to process a query for a given range [A..B]: We will call the s&quot;plit&quot; function twice and split the treap into formula_7 which contains formula_13, formula_8 which contains formula_15, and formula_16 which contains formula_17. After the query is answered we will call the join function twice to restore the original treap.

==== Addition/painting in a given range ====
To perform this operation we will proceed as follows:

* We will create an extra field D which will contain the added value for the subtree. We will create a function push which will be used to propagate this change from a node to its children. We will call this function at the beginning of all functions which modify the tree, &quot;i.e.&quot;, split and join so that after any changes made to the tree the information will not be lost.

==== Reverse in a given range ====
To show that the subtree of a given node needs to be reversed for each node we will create an extra boolean field R and set its value to true. To propagate this change we will swap the children of the node and set R to true for all of them.

<text>Tying (informally, product tying) is the practice of selling one product or service as a mandatory addition to the purchase of a different product or service. In legal terms, a &quot;tying sale&quot; makes the sale of one good (the &quot;tying good&quot;) to the de facto customer (or de jure customer) conditional on the purchase of a second distinctive good (the &quot;tied good&quot;). Tying is often illegal when the products are not naturally related. It is related to but distinct from freebie marketing, a common (and legal) method of giving away (or selling at a substantial discount) one item to ensure a continual flow of sales of another related item.

Some kinds of tying, especially by contract, have historically been regarded as anti-competitive practices. The basic idea is that consumers are harmed by being forced to buy an undesired good (the tied good) in order to purchase a good they actually want (the tying good), and so would prefer that the goods be sold separately. The company doing this bundling may have a significantly large market share so that it may impose the tie on consumers, despite the forces of market competition. The tie may also harm other companies in the market for the tied good, or who sell only single components.

One effect of tying can be that low quality products achieve a higher market share than would otherwise be the case.

Tying may also be a form of price discrimination: people who use more razor blades, for example, pay more than those who just need a one-time shave. Though this may improve overall welfare, by giving more consumers access to the market, such price discrimination can also transfer consumer surpluses to the producer. Tying may also be used with or in place of patents or copyrights to help protect entry into a market, discouraging innovation.

Tying is often used when the supplier makes one product that is critical to many customers. By threatening to withhold that key product unless others are also purchased, the supplier can increase sales of less necessary products.

In the United States, most states have laws against tying, which are enforced by state governments. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice enforces federal laws against tying through its Antitrust Division.

==Types==
Horizontal tying is the practice of requiring consumers to pay for an unrelated product or service together with the desired one. A hypothetical example would be for Bic to sell its pens only with Bic lighters. (However, offering a limited free item with another purchase as a promotion by a company does not constitute horizontal tying.)

Vertical tying is the practice of requiring customers to purchase related products or services together, from the same company. For example, a company might mandate that its automobiles could only be serviced by its own dealers. In an effort to curb this, many jurisdictions require that warranties not be voided by outside servicing; for example, see the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act in the United States.

==In United States law==
Certain tying arrangements are illegal in the United States under both the Sherman Antitrust Act, and Section 3 of the Clayton Act. A tying arrangement is defined as &quot;an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees he will not purchase the product from any other supplier.&quot; Tying may be the action of several companies as well as the work of just one firm. Success on a tying claim typically requires proof of four elements: (1) two separate products or services are involved; (2) the purchase of the tying product is conditioned on the additional purchase of the tied product; (3) the seller has sufficient market power in the market for the tying product; (4) a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product market is affected.

For at least three decades, the Supreme Court defined the required &quot;economic power&quot; to include just about any departure from perfect competition, going so far as to hold that possession of a copyright or even the existence of a tie itself gave rise to a presumption of economic power. The Supreme Court has since held that a plaintiff must establish the sort of market power necessary for other antitrust violations in order to prove sufficient &quot;economic power&quot; necessary to establish a per se tie. More recently, the Court has eliminated any presumption of market power based solely on the fact that the tying product is patented or copyrighted.

In recent years, changing business practices surrounding new technologies have put the legality of tying arrangements to the test. Although the Supreme Court still considers some tying arrangements as &quot;per se&quot; illegal, the Court actually uses a rule-of-reason analysis, requiring an analysis of foreclosure effects and an affirmative defense of efficiency justifications.

===Apple products===

The tying of Apple products is an example of commercial tying that has caused recent controversy. When Apple initially released the iPhone on June 29, 2007, it was sold exclusively with AT&amp;T (formerly Cingular) contracts in the United States. To enforce this exclusivity, Apple employed a type of software lock that ensured the phone would not work on any network besides AT&amp;T&#x27;s. Related to the concept of bricking, any user who tried to unlock or otherwise tamper with the locking software ran the risk of rendering their iPhone permanently inoperable.
This caused complaints among many consumers, as they were forced to pay an additional early termination fee of $175 if they wanted to unlock the device safely for use on a different carrier. Other companies such as Google complained that tying encourages a more closed-access-based wireless service. Many questioned the legality of the arrangement, and in October 2007 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple, claiming that its exclusive agreement with AT&amp;T violates California antitrust law. The suit was filed by the Law Office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith, and ultimately sought to have an injunction issued against Apple to prevent it from selling iPhones with any kind of software lock.

In July 2010, federal regulators clarified the issue when they determined it was lawful to unlock (or in other terms, &quot;jail break&quot;) the iPhone, declaring that there was no basis for copyright law to assist Apple in protecting its restrictive business model.
Jail breaking is removing operating system or hardware restrictions imposed on an iPhone (or other device). If done successfully, this allows one to run any application on the phone they choose, including applications not authorized by Apple. Apple told regulators that modifying the iPhone operating system leads to the creation of an infringing derivative work that is protected by copyright law. This means that the license on the operating system forbids software modification. However, regulators agreed that modifying an iPhone&#x27;s firmware/operating system to enable it to run an application that Apple has not approved is undoubtedly fair use.

===Microsoft products===
Another prominent case involving a tying claim was &quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot;. By some accounts, Microsoft ties together Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player, Outlook Express and Microsoft Office. The United States claimed that the bundling of Internet Explorer (IE) to sales of Windows 98, making IE difficult to remove from Windows 98 (e.g., not putting it on the &quot;Remove Programs&quot; list), and designing Windows 98 to work &quot;unpleasantly&quot; with Netscape Navigator constituted an illegal tying of Windows 98 and IE. Microsoft&#x27;s counterargument was that a web browser and a mail reader are simply part of an operating system, included with other personal computer operating systems, and the integration of the products was technologically justified. Just as the definition of a car has changed to include things that used to be separate products, such as speedometers and radios, Microsoft claimed the definition of an operating system has changed to include their formerly separate products. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Microsoft&#x27;s claim that Internet Explorer was simply one facet of its operating system, but the court held that the tie between Windows and Internet Explorer should be analyzed deferentially under the Rule of Reason. The U.S. government claim settled before reaching final resolution.

As to the tying of Office, parallel cases against Microsoft brought by State Attorneys General included a claim for harm in the market for office productivity applications. The Attorneys General abandoned this claim when filing an amended complaint. The claim was revived by Novell where they alleged that manufacturers of computers (&quot;OEMs&quot;) were charged less for their Windows bulk purchases if they agreed to bundle Office with every PC sold than if they gave computer purchasers the choice whether or not to buy Office along with their machines — making their computer prices less competitive in the market. The Novell litigation has since settled.

Microsoft has also tied its software to the third-party Android mobile operating system, by requiring manufacturers that license patents it claims covers the OS and smartphones to ship Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on the devices.

==Anti-tying provision of the Bank Holding Company Act==
In 1970, Congress enacted section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (BHCA), the anti-tying provision, which is codified at 12 U.S.C. § 1972. The statute was designed to prevent banks, whether large or small, state or federal, from imposing anticompetitive conditions on their customers. Tying is an antitrust violation, but the Sherman and Clayton Acts did not adequately protect borrowers from being required to accept conditions to loans issued by banks, and section 106 was specifically designed to apply to and remedy such bank misconduct.

Banks are allowed to take measures to protect their loans and to safeguard the value of their investments, such as requiring security or guaranties from borrowers. The statute exempts so-called “traditional banking practices” from its &quot;per se&quot; illegality, and thus its purpose is not so much to limit banks&#x27; lending practices, as it is to ensure that the practices used are fair and competitive. A majority of claims brought under the BHCA are denied. Banks still have quite a bit of leeway in fashioning loan agreements, but when a bank clearly steps over the bounds of propriety, the plaintiff is compensated with treble damages.

At least four regulatory agencies including the Federal Reserve Board oversee the activities of banks, their holding companies, and other related depository institutions. While each type of depository institution has a “primary regulator”, the nation&#x27;s “dual banking” system allows concurrent jurisdiction among the different regulatory agencies. With respect to the anti-tying provision, the Fed takes the preeminent role in relation to the other financial institution regulatory agencies, which reflects that it was considered the least biased (in favor of banks) of the regulatory agencies when section 106 was enacted.

==In European Law==

Tying is the &quot;practice of a supplier of one product, the tying product, requiring a buyer also to buy a second product, the tied product&quot;. The tying of a product can take various forms, that of contractual tying where a contract binds the buyer to purchase both products together, refusal to supply until the buyer agrees to purchase both products, withdrawal or withholding of a guarantee where the dominant seller will not provide the benefit of guarantee until the seller accepts to purchase that party&#x27;s product, technical tying occurs when the products of the dominant party are physically integrated and making impossible to buy the one without the other and bundling where two products are sold in the same package with one price. These practises are prohibited under Article 101(1)(e) and Article 102(2)(d) and may amount to an infringement of the statute if other conditions are satisfied. However, it is noteworthy that the Court is willing to find an infringement beyond those listed in Article 102(2)(d), see Tetra Pak v Commission.

== Enforcement under European law ==

The Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities sets out in which circumstances it will be appropriate taking actions against tying practices. First, it must be established whether the accused undertaking has a dominant position in the tying or tied product market. Subsequently, the next step is to determine whether the dominant undertaking tied two distinct products. This is important as two identical products cannot be considered tied under Article 102(2)(d) formulation that states products will be considered tied if they have no connects ‘by their nature or commercial usage’. This arises problems in the legal definition of what will amount to tying in scenarios of selling cars with tires or selling a car with a radio. Hence, the Commission provides guidance on this issue by citing the judgement in Microsoft and states that &quot;two products are distinct if, in the absence of tying or bundling, a substantial number of customers would purchase or would have purchased the tying product without also buying the tied product from the same supplier, thereby allowing stand-alone production for both the tying and the tied product&quot;. Next issue is whether the customer was coerced to purchase both the tying and the tied products as Article 102(2)(d) suggests: ‘making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations’. In situations of contractual stipulation, it is clear that the test will be satisfied; for an example of a non-contractual tying see Microsoft. Furthermore, for an undertaking to be deemed anti-competitive is whether the tie is capable of having foreclosure effect. Some examples of tying practices having an anti-competitive foreclosure effect in case law are the IBM, Eurofix-Bauco v Hilti, Telemarketing v CLT, British Sugar and Microsoft. Subsequently, the defence available for the dominant undertaking is that it can provide that tying is objectively justified or enhances efficiency and the commission is willing to consider claims that are tying may result in economic efficiency in production or distribution that will bring benefit to the consumers.
