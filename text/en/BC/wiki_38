<text>Saraswati (, ), also spelled as Sarasvati, is one of the principal goddesses in Hinduism, revered as the goddess of knowledge, education, learning, arts, speech, poetry, music, purification, language and culture. Together with the goddesses Lakshmi and Parvati, she forms the trinity, known as the Tridevi. Sarasvati is a pan-Indian deity, venerated not only in Hinduism but also in Jainism and Buddhism.

She is one of the prominent goddesses in the Vedic tradition (1500 to 500 BCE) who retains her significance in later Hinduism. In the Vedas, her characteristics and attributes are closely connected with the Sarasvati River, making her one of the earliest examples of a river goddess in Indian tradition. As a deity associated with a river, Sarasvati is revered for her dual abilities to purify and to nurture fertility. In later Vedic literature, particularly the Brahmanas, Sarasvati is increasingly identified with the Vedic goddess of speech, Vac, and eventually, the two merge into the singular goddess known in later tradition. Over time, her connection to the river diminishes, while her association with speech, poetry, music, and culture becomes more prominent. In classical and medieval Hinduism, Sarasvati is primarily recognized as the goddess of learning, arts and poetic inspiration, and as the inventor of the Sanskrit language. She is linked to the creator god Brahma, either as his consort or creation. In this role, she represents his creative power (&quot;Shakti&quot;), giving reality a unique and distinctly human quality. She becomes linked with the dimension of reality characterized by clarity and intellectual order. Within the goddess-oriented Shaktism tradition, Sarasvati is a key figure and venerated as the creative aspect of the Supreme Goddess. She is also significant in certain Vaishnava traditions, where she serves as one of Vishnu&#x27;s consorts and assists him in his divine functions. Despite her associations with these male deities, Sarasvati also stands apart as an independent goddess in the pantheon, worshipped without a consort.

She is portrayed as a serene woman with a radiant white complexion, dressed in white attire, representing the quality of &quot;sattva&quot; (goodness). She has four arms, each holding a symbolic object: a book, a rosary, a water pot, and a musical instrument known as the veena. Beside her is her mount, either a &quot;hamsa&quot; (white goose or swan) or a peacock. Hindu temples dedicated to Sarasvati can be found worldwide, with one of the earliest known shrines being Sharada Peeth (6th–12th centuries CE) in Kashmir. Sarasvati continues to be widely worshipped across India, particularly on her designated festival day, Vasant Panchami (the fifth day of spring, and also known as Sarasvati Puja and Sarasvati Jayanti in many regions of India), when students honor her as the patron goddess of knowledge and education. Traditionally, the day is marked by helping young children learn how to write the letters of the alphabet.

In Buddhism, she is venerated in many forms, including the East Asian Benzaiten (辯才天, &quot;Eloquence Talent Deity&quot;). In Jainism, Sarasvati is revered as the deity responsible for the dissemination of the Tirthankaras&#x27; teachings and sermons.

== Etymology ==

Sarasvati is a Sanskrit fusion word of &quot;saras&quot; (सरस्) meaning &quot;pooling water&quot;, but also sometimes translated as &quot;speech&quot;; and &quot;vati&quot; (वती), meaning &quot;she who possesses&quot;. Originally associated with the river or rivers known as Sarasvati, this combination, therefore, means &quot;she who has ponds, lakes, and pooling water&quot; or occasionally &quot;she who possesses speech&quot;. It is also a Sanskrit composite word of &quot;sarasu-ati&quot; (सरसु+अति) which means &quot;one with plenty of water&quot;.

The word Sarasvati appears both as a reference to a river and as a significant deity in the &quot;Rigveda.&quot; In initial passages, the word refers to the Sarasvati River and is mentioned as one among several northwestern Indian rivers such as the Drishadvati. Sarasvati, then, connotes a river deity. In Book 2, the Rigveda describes Sarasvati as the best of mothers, of rivers, of goddesses.

Her importance grows in the later Vedas composed after the &quot;Rigveda&quot; as well as in the later &quot;Brahmana&quot; texts, and the word evolves in its meaning from &quot;waters that purify&quot;, to &quot;that which purifies&quot;, to &quot;&quot;vach&quot; (speech) that purifies&quot;, to &quot;knowledge that purifies&quot;, and ultimately into a spiritual concept of a goddess that embodies knowledge, arts, music, melody, muse, language, rhetoric, eloquence, creative work and anything whose flow purifies the essence and self of a person.

=== Names and epithets ===
Sarasvati (Sanskrit: &quot;Sarasvatī&quot;) is known by many names.

== Literature ==
In Hinduism, Sarasvati has retained her significance as an important goddess, from the Vedic age up to the present day. She is praised in the &quot;Vedas&quot; as a water goddess of purification, while in the &quot;Dharmashastras&quot;, Sarasvati is invoked to remind the reader to meditate on virtue, and on the meaning (artha) of one&#x27;s actions (karma).

=== In Vedic literature ===

==== &quot;Rigveda&quot; ====
Sarasvati first appears in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the most ancient source of the Vedic religion. Sarawsati holds significant religious and symbolic value in the Rigveda, as a deified entity embodying attributes of abundance and power. Primarily linked with the celestial domain of Waters (Apas) and the formidable Storm Gods (Maruts), this deity forms an integral triadic association alongside the sacrificial goddesses Ila and Bharati within the pantheon.

Sarasvati is described as a loud and powerful flood who roars like a bull and cannot be controlled. She was associated with the Milky Way, indicating that she was seen as descending from heaven to earth.

The goddess is mentioned in many Rigvedic hymns, and has three hymns dedicated to her (6:61 exclusively, and 7:95-96 which she shares with her male counterpart, Sarasvant). In &quot;Rigveda&quot; 2.41.16 she is called: &quot;Best of mothers, the best of rivers, best of goddesses&quot;.

As part of the Apas (water deities), Sarasvati is associated with wealth, abundance, health, purity and healing. In Book 10 (10.17) of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Sarasvati is celebrated as a deity of healing and purifying water. In the &quot;Atharva Veda&quot;, her role as a healer and giver of life is also emphasized. In various sources, including the &quot;Yajur Veda&quot;, she is described as having healed Indra after he drank too much Soma.

Sarasvati also governs &quot;dhī&quot; (Rigveda 1:3:12c.). &quot;Dhī&quot; is the inspired thought (especially that of the rishis), it is intuition or intelligence – especially that associated with poetry and religion. Sarasvati is seen as a deity that can grant &quot;dhī&quot; (&quot;Rigveda&quot; 6:49:7c.) if prayed to. Since speech requires inspired thought, she is also inextricably linked with speech and with the goddess of speech, Vāc, as well as with cows and motherhood. Vedic seers compare her to a cow and a mother, and saw themselves as children sucking the milk of &quot;dhī&quot; from her. In Book 10 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, she is declared to be the &quot;possessor of knowledge&quot;. In later sources, like the &quot;Yajur Veda&quot;, Sarasvati is directly identified with Vāc, becoming a deity called Sarasvatī-Vāc.

In the &quot;Brahmanas,&quot; Sarasvati-Vac&#x27;s role expands, becoming clearly identified with knowledge (which is what is communicated through speech) and as such, she is &quot;the mother of the Vedas&quot; as well as the Vedas themselves. The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; states that &quot;as all waters meet in the ocean...so all sciences (vidya) unite (ekayanam) in Vāc&quot; (14:5:4:11). The &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; also presents Vāc as a secondary creator deity, having been the first deity created by the creator god Prajapati. She is the very instrument by which he created the world, flowing forth from him &quot;like a continuous stream of water&quot; according to the scripture. This is the basis for the Puranic stories about the relationship between Brahma (identified with Prajapati) and Sarasvati (identified with Vāc).

In other &quot;Rigvedic&quot; passages, Sarasvati is praised as a mighty and unconquerable protector deity. She is offered praises and compared to a sheltering tree in &quot;Rigveda&quot; 7.95.5, while in 6:49:7 cd she is said to provide &quot;protection which is difficult to assail.&quot; In some passages she even takes a fiercesome appearance and is called a &quot;slayer of strangers&quot; who is called on to &quot;guard her devotees against slander&quot;. Her association with the combative storm gods called Maruts is related to her fierce fighting aspect and they are said to be her companions (at &quot;Rigveda&quot; 7:96:2c.).

Like Indra, Sarasvati is also called a slayer of Vritra, the snake like demon of drought who blocks rivers and as such is associated with destruction of enemies and removal of obstacles. The &quot;Yajur Veda&quot; sees her as being both the mother of Indra (having granted him rebirth through healing) and also as his consort.

In Book 2 of &quot;Taittiriya Brahmana&quot;, Sarasvati is called &quot;the mother of eloquent speech and melodious music&quot;.

=== Epic literature ===
In the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Sarasvati appears above all as a sacred river, along which pilgrimages are made. She is also represented as goddess of speech and knowledge.&quot; She is called &quot;the best of rivers and greatest of streams&quot;, and with calm and tranquil waters, in contrast to the mighty torrential Vedic Sarasvati. Her banks are filled with priests and sages (rishis) who practice asceticism and sacrifices on her banks. There are numerous depictions of people making pilgrimages to the river to perform sacrifices and bathe in her waters and she often appears in her human form to great seers like Vasishtha.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; also commonly presents her as a goddess of knowledge in her own right and sees Vac as merely a feature of hers. She is called the mother of the Vedas in the &quot;Shanti Parva&quot; Book of the epic. Her beauty is also widely commented on by numerous passages and in one passage, the goddess herself states that her knowledge and her beauty arise from gifts made in the sacrifice. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; also describes her as the daughter of the creator god Brahma. Later she is described as the celestial creative symphony who appeared when Brahma created the universe.

In the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, when the rakshasa brothers Ravana, Vibhishana and Kumbhakarna, performed a penance in order to propitiate Brahma, the creator deity offered each a boon. The devas pleaded with Brahma to not grant Kumbhakarna his boon. Brahma called upon his consort Sarasvati, and instructed her to utter that which the devas desired. She acquiesced, and when the rakshasa spoke to invoke his boon, she entered his mouth, causing him to say, &quot;To sleep for innumerable years, O Lord of Lords, this is my desire!&quot;. She then left his form, causing him to reflect upon his misfortune.

=== Puranic literature ===
Sarasvati remains an important figure in the later medieval Puranic literature, where she appears in various myths and stories. Many Puranas relate the myth of her creation by the creator god Brahma and then describe how she became his consort. Sources which describe this myth include &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot;, &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; (which contains the most extensive account), &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; and &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;. Other Puranas give her slightly different roles and see her as the consort of other gods, such as Vishnu. In various Puranas, rites for her worship are given, and she is mainly worshiped for her command over speech, knowledge, and music.

Puranas like the &quot;Matsya&quot; also contain iconographic descriptions of Sarasvati, which provide the basis for her classic four armed form holding a book (representing the Vedas), mala, veena, and a water pot while being mounted on a swan (hamsa).

==== Association with Brahma ====

According to the &quot;Matsya Purana&quot;, Brahma generated Sarasvati, here also called by other names like Shatarupa, Savitri, Gayatri and Brahmani, out of himself for the purpose of creation, and mistakes her for his own daughter.

The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; then describes how Brahma begins to desire her intensely and cannot stop looking at her. Saraswati begins circumambulating him in reverence. Not wishing to keep turning his face to see her, Brahma produced faces on the sides and back of his head. Sarasvati then leapt into the sky and a fifth face emerged from Brahma, looking upwards. Brahma lost his powers as a result of his actions and told his sons to carry out his task, after which he married Sarasvati and they made love for one hundred years. Brahma felt shame and due to his act, the god loses his ascetic power (tapas) and his sons are left to create the world.

The birth of Sarasvati from the mind of Brahma is also described in the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; (chapter 43). Sarasvati is tasked to reside on tip of the tongue of all beings, a river on the earth and as a part of Brahma.

==== In the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; ====
A legend in the Bhagavata Purana describes Sarasvati as originally being one of the three wives of Vishnu, along with Lakshmi and Ganga. In the midst of a conversation, Sarasvati observed that Ganga playfully kept glancing at Vishnu, behind Lakshmi and her back. Frustrated, Sarasvati launched a furious tirade against Ganga, accusing her of stealing Vishnu&#x27;s love away from her. When Ganga appealed to her husband to help her, he opted to remain neutral, not wishing to participate in a quarrel between his three wives, whom he loved equally. When Lakshmi attempted to soothe Sarasvati&#x27;s anger by reasoning with her, the jealous goddess grew angry with her as well, accusing her of disloyalty towards her. She cursed Lakshmi to be born as the Tulasi plant upon the earth. Ganga, now enraged that Lakshmi had been cursed because she had defended her, cursed Sarasvati that she would be incarnated as a river on earth. Sarasvati issued the same curse against Ganga, informing her that sinful men would cleanse themselves of their sins with her water. As a result, Vishnu proclaimed that one part of Sarasvati would remain with him, that another would exist as a river on earth, and that another would later become the spouse of Brahma.

====Puranic Narratives of Sarasvati’s River Aspect====
In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Sarasvati is primarily depicted as a river goddess, embodying fertility and purity, and is revered as the personification of the Sarasvati River. Her role as the nurturing, life-giving force of the river is celebrated in hymns, where she is described as &quot;the best of mothers, of rivers, and of goddesses.&quot; A Rigvedic prayer also describes her as &#x27;the best of mothers, of rivers and of goddesses&#x27;. However, as Sarasvati’s association with knowledge, speech, and culture grew in prominence through the later Hindu texts, her direct connection with the physical river diminished. Despite this, the Puranas sustain Sarasvati&#x27;s riverine character by incorporating new narratives that preserve her role as a cosmic river in addition to her expanded identity.

The story of Sarasvati becoming a river is introduced in the Srishti Khanda of Padma Purana as well as in Skanda Purana. In the Skanda Purana, after the events of the Tarakamaya War, the devas deposited their arsenal of weapons at the hermitage of Dadhichi. When they sought the return of these weapons, the sage informed them that he had imbibed all of their power with his penance, and offered his own bones instead, which could serve as the source of new weapons. Despite the objections of the deities, the sage sacrificed himself, and his bones were employed in the manufacture of new arms by Vishvakarma. The sage&#x27;s son, Pippalada, upon hearing these events, sought to wreak his vengeance on the devas by performing a penance. A mare emerged from his right thigh, which in turn gave birth to a fiery man, Vadava, who threatened to be the doom of all of creation. Vishnu convinced Vadava that his best course of action would be to swallow the devas one by one, and that he should begin by consuming the primordial water of creation, which was the foremost of both the devas and the asuras. Vadava wished to be accompanied to the source of these waters by a virgin, and so Sarasvati was dispatched for his purpose, despite her reluctance. She took him to Varuna, the god of the ocean, who then consumed the being. For good measure, Sarasvati transformed into a divine river, flowing with five channels into the sea, making the waters sacred.

In the Padma Purana, it is stated that there was a terrible battle between the Bhargavas (a group of Brahmanas) and the Hehayas (a group of Kshatriyas). From this, an all-consuming fire called Vadavagni was born, which threatened to destroy the whole world. In some versions, a sage named Auva created it. Indra, Vishnu, and the devas visited Sarasvati, requesting her to deposit the fire in the western ocean, in order to protect the universe. Sarasvati told Vishnu that she would only agree to assist them if her consort, Brahma, told her to do so. Brahma ordered her to deposit the Vadavagni in the western ocean. Sarasvati agreed, and accompanied by Ganga, she left Brahmaloka, and arrived at Sage Uttanka&#x27;s ashrama. There, she met Shiva, who had decided to carry Ganga. He gave the Vadavagni in a pot to Sarasvati, and told her to originate from the plaksha tree. Sarasvati merged with the tree, and transformed into a river. From there, she flowed towards Pushkara. Sarasvati continued her journey towards the ocean, and stopped once at Pushkarini, where she redeemed humans from their sins. At last, she reached the end of her journey, and immersed the fire into the ocean.

=== Shakta texts ===
Sarasvati is a key figure in the Indian goddess centered traditions which are today known as Shaktism. Sarasvati appears in the Puranic &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; (&quot;Glory of the Goddess&quot;), a central text for Shaktism which was appended to the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; during the 6th century CE. In this text, she is part of the &quot;triple goddess&quot; (&quot;Tridevi&quot;) along with Mahakali, and Mahalakshmi. In Shaktism, this trinity (the Shakta response to the male trimurti of the other Hindu sects) is a manifestation of Mahadevi, the supreme goddess (and the highest deity out of which all deities, male or female, are born), which is also known by other names like Adi Parashakti (&quot;Primordial Supreme Power&quot;).

According to the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;, this supreme goddess is the primordial creator which is supreme formless (nirguna) consciousness (i.e. parabrahman, absolute reality) and the tridevi are her main saguna (&quot;with form&quot;, manifest, incarnated) emanations. MahaSarasvati is said to be creative and active principle (which is Rajasic, energetic and active), while Mahalakshmi is the sustainer (sattvic, &quot;goodness&quot;) and Mahakali is the destroyer (tamasic, &quot;darkness&quot;).

In other influential Shakta texts, such as the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; and the &quot;Devi Upanishad,&quot; Sarasvati (along with all Hindu goddesses) is also said to be a manifestation of the supreme Mahadevi.

In Tantric Shakta sources, Sarasvati takes many forms. A key tantric form is Matangi, a deity considered to be the &quot;Tantric Sarasvati&quot;. Mātaṅgī retains many attributes of Sarasvati, like music and learning, but is also associated with defeating enemies, disease, pollution/impurity, and outcasts (chandalas). She is often offered half eaten or leftover food and is green in color. Matangi is also part of the Shakta set of goddesses known as the ten Mahavidyas.

Matangi is important in Shri Vidya Shaktism, where she is also known as the dark blue Shyamala (&quot;dark in complexion&quot;) and is a manifestation of Lalita Tripurasundari&#x27;s Jñana Shakti (wisdom power), having arisen out of Lalita&#x27;s sugarcane bow. She is celebrated in the holiday Syamala Navaratri and is seen as Lalita&#x27;s prime minister. There are various chants and odes (stotras) to this deity, perhaps the most important being the &quot;Śrī Śyāmalā Daṇḍakam&quot; by the great Indian Sanskrit poet Kalidasa.

== Symbolism and iconography ==
The goddess Sarasvati is often depicted as a beautiful woman dressed in pure white, often seated on a white lotus, which symbolizes light, knowledge and truth. She not only embodies knowledge but also the experience of the highest reality. Her iconography is typically in white themes from dress to flowers to swan – the colour symbolizing Sattwa Guna or purity, discrimination for true knowledge, insight and wisdom.

Her dhyana mantra describes her to be as white as the moon, clad in a white dress, bedecked in white ornaments, radiating with beauty, holding a book and a pen in her hands (the book represents knowledge).

She is generally shown to have four arms, but sometimes just two. When shown with four hands, those hands symbolically mirror her husband Brahma&#x27;s four heads, representing &quot;manas&quot; (mind, sense), &quot;buddhi&quot; (intellect, reasoning), &quot;citta&quot; (imagination, creativity), and &quot;ahamkāra&quot; (self consciousness, ego). Brahma represents the abstract, while she represents action and reality.
The four hands hold items with symbolic meaning – a &quot;pustaka&quot; (book or script), a &quot;mālā&quot; (rosary, garland), a water pot and a musical instrument (vīnā). The book she holds symbolizes the Vedas representing the universal, divine, eternal, and true knowledge as well as all forms of learning. A mālā of crystals, representing the power of meditation, inner reflection, and spirituality. A pot of water represents the purifying power to separate right from wrong, the clean from the unclean, and essence from the inessential. In some texts, the pot of water is symbolism for soma – the drink that liberates and leads to knowledge. The most famous feature on Sarasvati is a musical instrument called a veena, represents all creative arts and sciences, and her holding it symbolizes expressing knowledge that creates harmony. Sarasvati is also associated with &quot;anurāga&quot;, the love for and rhythm of music, which represents all emotions and feelings expressed in speech or music.

A hamsa – either a swan or a goose – is often shown near her feet. In Hindu mythology, the hamsa is a sacred bird, which if offered a mixture of milk and water, is said to have a unique ability to separate and drink the milk alone, and leave the water behind. This characteristic of the bird serves as a metaphor for the pursuit of wisdom amidst the complexities of life, the ability to discriminate between good and evil, truth from untruth, essence from the outward show, and the eternal from the evanescent. Due to her association with the swan, Sarasvati is also referred to as &quot;Hamsavāhini&quot;, which means &quot;she who has a hamsa as her vehicle&quot;. The swan is also a symbolism for spiritual perfection, transcendence and moksha.

Sometimes a &quot;citramekhala&quot; (also called &quot;mayura&quot;, peacock) is shown beside the goddess. The peacock symbolizes colorful splendor, the celebration of dance, and – as the devourer of snakes – the alchemical ability to transmute the serpent poison of self into the radiant plumage of enlightenment.

==Forms and avatars==
Many different avatars and forms of Sarasvati have been attested in scriptures.

She is venerated as MahaSarasvati in the Kashmir Shakti Peetha, as Vidhya Sarasvati in Basara and Vargal, and as Sharadamba in Sringeri. In some regions, she is known by her twin identities, Savitri and Gayatri.

In Shaktism, she takes her Matrika (mother goddess) avatar as Brahmani. Sarasvati is not just the goddess of knowledge and wisdom, but also the Brahmavidya herself, the goddess of the wisdom of ultimate truth. Her Mahavidya form is Matangi.

*Vidhya, she is the formless concept of wisdom and knowledge in all of its aspects.
*Gayatri, she is the personification of the Vedas
*Savitri, She is the personification of purity, the consort of Brahma

=== Maha Sarasvati ===
In some regions of India, such as Vindhya, Odisha, West Bengal and Assam, as well as east Nepal, Sarasvati is part of the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; Shakta mythology, in the &quot;Tridevi&quot; of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and MahaSarasvati. This is one of many different Hindu legends that attempt to explain how the Hindu trimurti of gods (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) and goddesses (Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Parvati) came into being. Various Purana texts offer alternate legends for Maha Sarasvati.

Maha Sarasvati is depicted as eight-armed and is often portrayed holding a Veena whilst sitting on a white lotus flower.

Her meditation verse given at the beginning of the fifth chapter the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; is:Wielding in her lotus-hands the bell, trident, ploughshare, conch, pestle, discus, bow, and arrow, her lustre is like that of a moon shining in the autumn sky. She is born from the body of Gauri and is the sustaining base of the three worlds. That MahaSarasvati I worship here who destroyed Sumbha and other asuras.MahaSarasvati is also part of another legend, the &quot;Navshaktis&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Navdurgas&quot;), or nine forms of Shakti, namely Brahmi, Vaishnavi, Maheshwari, Kaumari, Varahi, Narsimhi, Aindri, Shivdooti, and Chamunda, revered as powerful and dangerous goddesses in eastern India. They have special significance on &quot;Navaratri&quot; in these regions. All of these are seen ultimately as aspects of a single great Hindu goddess, Durga, with Maha Sarasvati as one of those nine.

=== Mahavidya Nila Sarasvati ===
In Tibet and parts of India, NilaSarasvati is sometimes considered as a form of Mahavidya Tara. Nila Sarasvati is not much a different deity from traditional Sarasvati, who subsumes her knowledge and creative energy in tantric literature. Though the traditional form of Sarasvati is of calm, compassionate, and peaceful one: Nila Sarasvati is the &quot;ugra&quot; (angry, violent, destructive) manifestation in one school of Hinduism, while the more common Sarasvati is the &quot;saumya&quot; (calm, compassionate, productive) manifestation found in most others. In tantric literature of the former, NilaSarasvati has 100 names. There are separate dhyana shlokas and mantras for her worship in Tantrasara.
She is worshipped in parts of India as an incarnate or incarnation of Goddess Tara but mostly outside India. She is not only worshipped but also been manifested as a form of Goddess Sarasvati.

=== Sharada avatar in Kashmir ===
The earliest known shrine dedicated to goddess worship in Kashmir is Sharada Peeth (6th–12th centuries CE), dedicated to the goddess Sharada. It is a ruined Hindu temple and ancient centre of learning located in present-day Azad Kashmir. The goddess Sharada worshipped in Sharada Peeth is a tripartite embodiment of the goddess Shakti: Sharada (goddess of learning), Sarasvati (goddess of knowledge), and Vagdevi (goddess of speech, which articulates power). Kashmiri Pandits believe the shrine to be the abode of the goddess. In line with the Kashmiri Pandit belief that springs which are the abode of goddesses should not be looked at directly, the shrine contains a stone slab concealing the spring underneath, which they believe to be the spring in which the goddess Sharada revealed herself to the &quot;rishi&quot; Shandilya. It advanced the importance of knowledge and education in Kashmiri Pandit culture, which persisted well after Kashmiri Pandits became a minority group in Kashmir.

As one of the &quot;Maha Shakti Peethas&quot;, Hindus believe that it represents the spiritual location of the goddess Sati&#x27;s fallen right hand. Sharada Peeth is one of the three holiest sites of pilgrimage for Kashmiri Pandits, alongside the Martand Sun Temple and the Amarnath Temple.

=== Festivals and pujas ===
One of the most famous festivals associated with Goddess Sarasvati is the Hindu festival of Vasant Panchami. Celebrated on the 5th day in the Hindu calendar month of Magha, it is also known as Sarasvati Puja and Sarasvati Jayanti in India.

==== In south India ====

In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the last three days of the Navaratri festival, i.e., Ashtami, Navami, and Dashami, are celebrated as Sarasvati Puja.

The celebrations start with the &quot;Puja Vypu&quot; (Placing for Worship). It consists of placing the books for puja on the Ashtami day. It may be in one&#x27;s own house, in the local nursery school run by traditional teachers, or in the local temple. The books are taken out for reading, after worship, only on the morning of the third day (Vijaya Dashami). It is called &quot;Puja Eduppu&quot; (Taking [from] Puja). On the Vijaya Dashami day, Kerala and Tamil Nadu celebrate the &quot;Eḻuthiniruthu&quot; or &quot;Initiation of writing&quot; for children, before they are admitted to nursery schools. This is also called &quot;Vidyarambham&quot;. The child is often ritually taught to write for the first time on rice spread in a plate with their index finger, guided by an elder of the family, or by a teacher.

==== In east and northeast India ====

In Assam, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura, Goddess Sarasvati is worshipped on Vasant Panchami, a Hindu festival celebrated every year on the 5th day in the Hindu calendar month of Magha (about February). Hindus celebrate this festival in temples, homes and educational institutes alike.

==== In north, west, and central India ====
In Bihar and Jharkhand, Vasant Panchami is commonly known as Sarasvati Puja. On this day, Goddess Sarasvati is worshipped in schools, colleges, educational institutes as well as in institutes associated with music and dance. Cultural programmes are also organised in schools and institutes on this day. People especially students worship Goddess Sarasvati also in pandals (a tent made up of colourful clothes, decorated with lights and other decorative items). In these states, on the occasion of Sarasvati Puja, Goddess Sarasvati is worshipped in the form of idol, made up of soil. On Sarasvati Puja, the idol is worshipped by people and prasad is distributed among the devotees after puja. Prasad mainly consists of boondi (&quot;motichoor&quot;), pieces of carrot, peas and Indian plum (ber). On the next day or any day depending on religious condition, the idol is immersed in a pond (known as Murti Visarjan or Pratima Visarjan) after performing a Havana (immolation), with full joy and fun, playing with abir and gulal. After Pratima Visarjan, members involved in the organisation of puja ceremony eat khichdi together.

In Goa, Sarasvati Puja starts with Sarasvati Avahan on Maha Saptami and ends on Vijayadashami with Sarasvati Udasan or Visarjan.

In 2018, the Haryana government launched and sponsored the annual National Sarasvati Mahotsav in its state named after Sarasvati.

==== In Indonesia ====

Watugunung, the last day of the pawukon calendar, is devoted to Sarasvati, goddess of learning. Although it is devoted to books, reading is not allowed. The fourth day of the year is called Pagerwesi, meaning &quot;iron fence&quot;. It commemorates a battle between good and evil.

Sarasvati is an important goddess in Balinese Hinduism. She shares the same attributes and iconography as Sarasvati in Hindu literature of India – in both places, she is the goddess of knowledge, creative arts, wisdom, language, learning and purity. In Bali, she is celebrated on Sarasvati day, one of the main festivals for Hindus in Indonesia. The day marks the close of 210 day year in the Pawukon calendar.

On Sarasvati day, people make offerings in the form of flowers in temples and to sacred texts. The day after Sarasvati day, is &quot;Banyu Pinaruh&quot;, a day of cleansing. On this day, Hindus of Bali go to the sea, sacred waterfalls or river spots, offer prayers to Sarasvati, and then rinse themselves in that water in the morning. Then they prepare a feast, such as the traditional &quot;bebek betutu&quot; and &quot;nasi kuning&quot;, that they share.

The Sarasvati Day festival has a long history in Bali. It has become more widespread in Hindu community of Indonesia in recent decades, and it is celebrated with theatre and dance performance.

==== Southeast Asia ====
Sarasvati was honoured with invocations among the Hindus of Angkorian Cambodia. She and Brahma are referred to in Cambodian epigraphy from the 7th century onwards, and she is praised by Khmer poets for being the goddess of eloquence, writing, and music. More offerings were made to her than to her husband Brahma. She is also referred to as &quot;Vagisvari&quot; and &quot;Bharati&quot; in the Khmer literature of the era of Yasovarman, Hindu king of the Khmer Empire.

== In Buddhism ==
In Buddhism, Sarasvati became a prominent deity which retained many of her Vedic associations, such as speech, texts, knowledge, healing and protection. She also became known as the consort of Manjushri, the bodhisattva of wisdom (prajña). According to Miranda Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Buddhist Goddesses of India&quot;:Sarasvati&#x27;s association with the intellectual sphere assured that she would find favor among Buddhists, who highly value wisdom and its servants: mental clarity, reasoning ability, memorization, and oratorical skill. Sarasvati thus has an affinity with Prajñaparamita, the goddess of perfect wisdom. They may be in voked by the same mantra, reflecting the kinship between the wisdom goddess and the patroness of learning. Shaw lists various epithets for Sarasvati used by Buddhist source including: &quot;Emanation of Vishnu,&quot; &quot;Gandharva Maiden,&quot; &quot;Swan Child,&quot; &quot;Daughter of Brahma&quot;, &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;, &quot;Sister of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Goddess of Speech&quot;, &quot;Divine Lady Who Empowers Enlightened Speech&quot;, &quot;Goddess Rich with the Power of Adamantine Speech&quot;, &quot;Bestower of Understanding&quot;, &quot;Goddess of Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;Wisdom Goddess.&quot;
According to Shaw, Buddhist depictions of Sarasvati are influenced by Hindu ones. A popular depiction is called &quot;Lady of the Adamantine Lute&quot; (Vajravina) which is described by Shaw as.a white, two-armed epiphany in which she plays her supernal lute, or vina. The instrument is made of lapis lazuli and has a thousand strings capable of eliciting every musical note. Sarasvati&#x27;s melodies pervade the universe and delight all types of beings in accordance with whatever is most pleasing to their ears. She sits with ankles crossed and knees raised in a distinctive posture suitable for balancing a musical instrument. Sarasvati&#x27;s earliest appearance in a Buddhist text is in the 1st century CE Mahayana &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; (of which there are different versions / translations). This text is first attested in a Chinese translation in 417 CE and includes an entire chapter devoted to the goddess, which is our best source for the earliest Buddhist depictions of Sarasvati.

=== In the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; ===
In the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; (&quot;Suvarṇaprabhāsa Sūtra&quot;), Sarasvati appears and pays homage to the Buddha. As Shaw writes, she then &quot;promises that she will grace the preachers of the scripture with eloquence, oratorical power, perfect memory, inconceivable knowledge, penetrating wisdom, illumination, skill in liberating others, scholarly expertise in every field, proficiency in all the arts, merit, prosperity, and long life.&quot;

Sarasvati&#x27;s chapter in the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; presents three main aspects of the goddess. First, it presents her as a goddess of eloquence and speech, then it presents her as a healing goddess who teaches a ritual which includes a medicinal bath, finally it presents Sarasvati as a goddess of protection and war. Ludvik mentions that the earliest version of the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; (the translation by Dharmaksema) actually only includes the first depiction. The early Chinese Buddhist translators chose to translate her name as &quot;great eloquence deity&quot; (大辯天) the later translations by Yijing use &quot;Eloquence Talent Goddess&quot; (Biancai tiannu), though phonetic translations were also applied (e.g. Yijing&#x27;s &quot;mohetipi suoluosuobodi&quot;).

In the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot;, Sarasvati is closely associated with eloquence, as well as with the closely connected virtues of memory and knowledge. Sarasvati is also said to help monks memorize the Buddhist sutras and to guide them so they will not make mistakes in memorizing them or forget them later. She will also help those who have incomplete manuscripts to regain the lost letters or words. She also teaches a dharani (a long mantra-like recitation) to improve memory. The &quot;Golden Light&quot; goes as far as to claim that Sarasvati can provide the wisdom to understand all the Buddhist teachings and skillful means (upaya) so that one may swiftly attain Buddhahood.

In some versions of the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot;, such as Yijing&#x27;s, the goddess then teaches an apotropaic ritual that can combat disease, bad dreams, war, calamities and all sorts of negative things. It includes bathing in a bath with numerous herbs that has been infused with a dharani spell. This passage contains much information on ancient materia medica and herbology. Ludvik adds that this may be connected to her role as healer of Indra in the &quot;Yajur Veda&quot; and to ancient Indian bathing rites.

In the latter part of the &quot;Golden Light&quot;″s Sarasvati chapter, she is praised as a protector goddess by the Brahman Kaundinya. This section also teaches a dharani and a ritual to invoke the goddess and receive her blessings in order to obtain knowledge. In latter sections of Kaundinya&#x27;s praise, she is described as an eight armed goddess and compared to a lion. The text also states that is some recites these praises, &quot;one obtains all desires, wealth and grain, and one gains splendid, noble success.&quot; The poem describes Sarasvati as one who &quot;has sovereignty in the world&quot;, and states that she fights in battlefields and is always victorious. The hymn then describes Sarasvati&#x27;s warlike eight-armed form. She carries eight weapons in each hand – a bow, arrow, sword, spear, axe, vajra, iron wheel, and noose.

Kaudinya&#x27;s hymn to Sarasvati in Yijing&#x27;s translation is derived from the &quot;Āryāstava&quot; (&quot;praise of she who is noble&quot;), a hymn uttered by Vishnu to the goddess Nidra (lit. &quot;Sleep&quot;, one of the names applied to Durga) found in the &quot;Harivamsha&quot;. As the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; is often concerned with the protection of the state, it is not surprising that the fierce, weapon-wielding Durga, who was widely worshiped by rulers and warriors alike for success in battle, provides the model for the appearance assumed by Sarasvati, characterized as a protectress of the Buddhist Dharma. Bernard Faure argues that the emergence of a martial Sarasvatī may have been influenced by the fact that &quot;Vāc, the Vedic goddess of speech, had already displayed martial characteristics. [...] Already in the &quot;Vedas&quot;, it is said that she destroys the enemies of the gods, the asuras. Admittedly, later sources seem to omit or downplay that aspect of her powers, but this does not mean that its importance in religious practice was lost.&quot;

=== Other Indian Mahayana sources ===

In some later Mahayana Buddhist sources like the &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot; (a 5th-century collection of ritual texts), Sarasvati is symbolically represented in a way which is similar to Hindu iconography. The description of the deity (here called Mahāsarasvatī) is as follows:The worshipper should think himself as goddess Mahāsarasvatī, who is resplendent like the autumn moon, rests on the moon over the white lotus, shows the &quot;varada-mudrā&quot; in her right hand, and carries in the left the white lotus with its stem. She has a smiling countenance, is extremely compassionate, wears garments decorated with white sandal-flowers. Her bosom is decorated with the pearl-necklace, and she is decked in many ornaments; she appears a maiden of twelve years, and her bosom is uneven with half-developed breasts like flower-buds; she illumines the three worlds with the immeasurable light that radiates from her body.In the &quot;Sādhanamālā,&quot; the mantra of Sarasvati is: oṃ hrīḥ mahāmāyāṅge mahāsarasvatyai namaḥ

The &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot; also depicts other forms of Sarasvati, including Vajravīṇā Sarasvatī (similar to Mahāsarasvatī except she carries a veena), Vajraśāradā Sarasvatī (who has three eyes, sits on a white lotus, her head is decorated by a crescent and holds a book and a lotus), Vajrasarasvatī (has six hands and three heads with brown hair rising upwards), and Āryasarasvatī (sixteen-year-old girl carrying the Prajñapramita sutra and a lotus).

According to the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra&quot; ( 4th century – 5th century CE&quot;), Sarasvati was born from the eyetooth of Avalokiteshvara.&quot;

Sarasvati is also briefly mentioned in the esoteric &quot;Vairochanabhisambodhi Sutra&quot; as one of the divinities of the western quarter of the Outer Vajra section of the Womb Realm Mandala along with Prithvi, Vishnu (Narayana), Skanda (Kumara), Vayu, Chandra, and their retinue. The text later also describes the veena as Sarasvati&#x27;s symbol. The Chinese translation of this sutra renders her name variously as 辯才 (Ch. &quot;Biàncái&quot;; Jp. &quot;Benzai&quot;, lit. &quot;eloquence&quot;), 美音天 (Ch. &quot;Měiyīntiān&quot;; Jp. &quot;Bionten&quot;, &quot;goddess of beautiful sounds&quot;), and 妙音天 (Ch. &quot;Miàoyīntiān&quot;; Jp. &quot;Myōonten&quot;, &quot;goddess of wonderful sounds&quot;). Here, Sarasvati is portrayed with two arms holding a veena and situated between Narayana&#x27;s consort Narayani and Skanda (shown riding on a peacock).

Sarasvati was initially depicted as a single goddess without consort. Her association with the bodhisattva of wisdom Manjusri is drawn from later tantric sources such as the &quot;Kṛṣṇayamāri tantra,&quot; where she is depicted as red skinned (known as &quot;Red Sarasvati&quot;).

In various Indian tantric sadhanas to Sarasvati (which only survive in Tibetan translation), her bija (seed) mantra is Hrīḥ.

=== Nepalese Buddhism ===
Sarasvati is worshiped in Nepalese Buddhism, where she is a popular deity, especially for students. She is celebrated in an annual festival called Vasant Pañcami and children first learn the alphabet during a Sarasvati ritual. In Nepalese Buddhism, her worship is often combined with that of Manjusri and many sites for the worship of Manjusri are also used to worship Sarasvati, including Svayambhu Hill.

=== In East Asian Buddhism ===
Veneration of Sarasvati migrated from the Indian subcontinent to China with the spread of Buddhism, where she in known as Biàncáitiān (辯才天), meaning &quot;Eloquent Devī&quot;, as well as Miàoyīntiān (妙音天), meaning &quot;Devī of Wonderful Sounds&quot;.

She is commonly enshrined in Chinese Buddhist monasteries as one of the Twenty-Four Devas, a group of protective deities who are regarded as protectors of the Buddhist dharma. Her Chinese iconography is based on her description in the &quot;Golden Light Sutra,&quot; where she is portrayed as having eight arms, one holding a bow, one holding arrows, one holding a knife, one holding a lance, one holding an axe, one holding a pestle, one holding an iron wheel, and one holding ropes. In another popular Buddhist iconographic form, she is portrayed as sitting down and playing a pipa, a Chinese lute-like instrument. The concept of Sarasvati migrated from India, through China to Japan, where she appears as Benzaiten (弁財天, lit. &quot;goddess of eloquence&quot;). Worship of Benzaiten arrived in Japan during the 6th through 8th centuries. She is often depicted holding a &quot;biwa&quot;, a traditional Japanese lute musical instrument. She is enshrined on numerous locations throughout Japan such as the Kamakura&#x27;s Zeniarai Benzaiten Ugafuku Shrine or Nagoya&#x27;s Kawahara Shrine; the three biggest shrines in Japan in her honour are at the Enoshima Island in Sagami Bay, the Chikubu Island in Lake Biwa, and the Itsukushima Island in Seto Inland Sea.

In Japanese esoteric Buddhism (mikkyo), the main mantra for this deity is:&quot;Oṃ&quot; &quot;Sarasvatyai svāhā&quot; (Sino-Japanese: &quot;On Sarasabatei-ei Sowaka&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

=== In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism ===
In the Indo-Tibetan Buddhism of the Himalayan regions, Sarasvati is known as &quot;Yangchenma&quot; (), which means &#x27;&quot;Goddess of Melodious Voice&quot;. She is also called the Tara of Music () as one of the 21 Taras. She is also considered the consort of Manjushri, bodhisattva of Wisdom. Sarasvati is the divine embodiment &amp; bestower of enlightened eloquence &amp; inspiration. For all those engaged in creative endeavours in Tibetan Buddhism she is a patroness of the arts, sciences, music, language, literature, history, poetry &amp; philosophy.

Sarasvati also became associated with the Tibetan deity Palden Lhamo (Glorious Goddess) who is a fierce protector deity in the Gelugpa tradition known as Magzor Gyalmo (the Queen who Repels Armies). Sarasvati was the yidam (principal personal meditational deity) of 14th century Tibetan monk Je Tsongkhapa, who composed a devotional poem to her.

Tibetan Buddhism teaches numerous mantras of Sarasvati. Her seed syllable is often Hrīṃ. In a sadhana (ritual text) revealed by the great Tibetan female lama Sera Khandro, her mantra is presented as:Oṃ hrīṃ devi prajñā vārdhani ye svāhā

=== In South East Asian Buddhism ===
In Burmese Buddhism, Sarasvati is worshipped as Thurathadi (), an important nat (Burmese deity) and is a guardian of the Buddhist scriptures (Tipitaka), scholars, students and writers. Students in Myanmar often pray for her blessings before their exams. She is an important deity to the esoteric weizzas (Buddhist wizards) of Burma.

In ancient Thai literature, Sarasvati (; ) is the goddess of speech and learning, and consort of Brahma. Over time, Hindu and Buddhist concepts merged in Thailand. Icons of Sarasvati with other deities of India are found in old Thai &quot;wats&quot;. Amulets with Sarasvati and a peacock are also found in Thailand.

== In Jainism ==

Sarasvati is also revered in Jainism as the goddess of knowledge and is regarded as the source of all learning. She is known as Srutadevata, Sarada, and Vagisvari. Sarasvati is depicted in a standing posture with four arms, one holding a text, another holding a rosary and the remaining two holding the Veena. Sarasvati is seated on a lotus with the peacock as her vehicle. Sarasvati is also regarded as responsible for dissemination of tirthankars sermon. The earliest sculpture of Sarasvati in any religious tradition is the Mathura Jain Sarasvati from Kankali Tila dating from 132 CE.

<text>:&quot;See for Wikipedia&#x27;s image licensing tag.&quot;

Parliamentary copyright is a form of copyright in works made by either of the two Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: the House of Lords or the House of Commons. It also applies to bills proposed in either House and to the devolved legislatures in the United Kingdom: the Scottish Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly or Senedd Cymru – the Welsh Parliament.

==History==
Parliamentary copyright was first created in the United Kingdom by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Prior to this legislation being passed, what is now covered by parliamentary copyright was Crown copyright. Parliamentary works produced prior to 1 August 1989 are therefore Crown, rather than parliamentary, copyright.

==Application==
Parliamentary copyright applies where a work is made &quot;by or under the direction or control of the House of Commons or the House of Lords&quot;. Where parliamentary copyright applies, the work qualifies for copyright protection even though the usual requirements relating to qualifications for copyright protection may not apply. The House by whom, or under whose direction or control, the work is made is the first owner of any copyright in the work, and if the work is made by or under the direction or control of both Houses, the two Houses are joint first owners of copyright.

Copyright in such a work is referred to in this Part as &quot;parliamentary copyright&quot;, notwithstanding that it may be, or have been, assigned to another person. Parliamentary copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work lasts for 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the work was made.

&quot;Works made by or under the direction or control of the House of Commons or the House of Lords&quot; includes work made by an officer or employee of that House in the course of his duties, and any sound recording, film or live broadcast of the proceedings of that House, but a work is not regarded as made &quot;by or under the direction or control&quot; of either House simply because it has been commissioned by or on behalf of that House. In the case of a work of joint authorship where Parliamentary copyright applies, Parliamentary copyright only extends to the portion that it applies to and not the whole work.

For the purposes of holding and enforcing copyright, the two Houses of Parliament, which otherwise only exist during the lifetime of a Parliament (and not during a dissolution or prorogation) are treated as having the legal capacities of a body corporate. The copyrights created by the act are enforceable by and in the name of the Speaker of the House of Commons, or the Clerk of the Parliaments in respect of the House of Lords.

===Legislation===
====Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom====
Copyright in bills introduced into Parliament belongs to one or both of the Houses of Parliament. A bill is normally introduced into one of the two Houses first, and once it is approved by one it goes to the other.

Copyright in public bills belongs to the House into which the bill is introduced, and if it is passed by that House, it is then shared by both Houses jointly. The copyright starts from the time when the text of the bill is handed in to the House in which it is introduced. Copyright in private bills belongs to both Houses jointly and starts from the time when a copy of the bill is first deposited in either House. Copyright in a personal bill belongs in the first instance to the House of Lords, and if it is passed by that House, it is then shared by both Houses jointly. This copyright only starts when the bill has First Reading in the House of Lords.

This form of parliamentary copyright ceases when a bill is granted royal assent, or if the bill does not receive royal assent, on the withdrawal or rejection of the bill or the end of the session. However, copyright in a bill continues even if rejected by the House of Lords if, by virtue of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, it remains possible for it to be presented for royal assent in that session. Once parliamentary copyright starts to apply in relation to a bill, it removes any other form of copyright which might have applied.

====Bills in other legislatures====
The same principles apply in respect of bills introduced into the Scottish Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly or the Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament, from the point a bill is introduced until it is either given royal assent, or withdrawn or rejected. In these cases, the copyright belongs to the corporate body of the respective legislature: the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission or the Senedd Commission.

===Acts===
When a bill (of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or one of the devolved legislatures) is given royal assent by the King, it becomes an act. Royal assent is also given to Church of England measures. Parliamentary copyright ends on royal assent and instead Crown copyright commences for a period of 50 years, to the exclusion of any other form of copyright.

<doc id="245924" wikidata="Q920319" url="?curid=245924" title="Namtar">
<text>Namtar () was a figure in ancient Mesopotamian religion who, depending on the context, could be regarded both as a minor god and as a demon of disease. He is best attested as the sukkal (attendant deity) of Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld. Like her, he was not the object of active worship, though references to it are made in literary texts, and additionally some incantations entrust him with keeping various other malevolent forces in the underworld.

==Character and functions==
Namtar&#x27;s name means &quot;fate&quot; in Sumerian. It can be differentiated from the ordinary word &quot;fate&quot; in Sumerian texts due to being preceded by the dingir sign, so-called divine determinative, used to identify the names of deities. The same name was used in Akkadian, written as &quot;dnam-ta-ru&quot;. Jacob Klein notes that true to his name, Namtar was most likely understood as the personification of unavoidable fate, implicitly understood as death. Aicha Rahmouni compares the role of Namtar in Mesopotamian beliefs to that played by Mot, the personified death, in Ugaritic texts.

The primary roles of Namtar in the Mesopotamian pantheon were those of a minor god of the underworld and of a disease demon, especially strongly associated with headaches and heart pain. While his two roles were interconnected, according to Jacob Klein the precise development of his character is presently impossible to discern. Barbara Böck proposes that he was initially only a disease demon, and developed into Ereshkigal&#x27;s sukkal at some point in the second millennium BCE.

His appearance was typically described as fearsome, with references to such traits as &quot;twisted hands&quot; or &quot;mouth filled with venom.&quot; The &quot;Underworld Vision of an Assyrian Prince&quot; states that he could be depicted slaying a man with a sword.

No attestations of Namtar as a deity are known from before the Old Babylonian period. While the word &quot;namtar&quot;, without the divine determinative. does appear in personal names from the earlier Ur III period, they are unlikely to refer to him, as according to Dina Katz, theophoric names invoking him are not known from later periods, similar as in the case of his mistress Ereshkigal.

Namtar is generally absent from offering lists, indicating he had no active cult. Making offerings to him is nonetheless mentioned in a few literary texts, including &quot;Death of Gilgamesh&quot; and &quot;Death of Ur-Namma&quot;, in both cases being undertaken by the eponymous protagonist.

Incantations indicate that the medicine goddess Ninisina was invoked to counter Namtar&#x27;s influence. The same function was also attributed to Asalluhi. However, Namtar could in turn be implored to take care of other demons, for example an incantation against &quot;Mimma Lemnu&quot;, the personified &quot;Any Evil,&quot; entrusts him with keeping this being imprisoned in the underworld. An incantation addressed to the fire god Girra asks him to hand over the enemies of the petitioner to Namtar.

==Associations with other deities==
Namtar served as the sukkal of Ereshkigal, though less commonly he could also be referred to as the sukkal of Nergal. Some texts simply refer to him as &quot;sukkal of the underworld,&quot; &quot;sukkal eresetiki&quot;.

According to the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Namtar had a wife, Hušbišag, known also from various myths and incantations. She was called the &quot;stewardess of the underworld.&quot; Their daughter was Ḫedimmeku, though she is also mentioned as a daughter of Enki in a different section of the same god list. Namtar&#x27;s mother is identified as Mardula&#x27;anki, already attested in this role in earlier lists. A single source applies the name Ḫumussiru (&quot;mouse&quot;) to her. though it was more commonly applied to the god Amurru and it is unclear how it came to be associated with Namtar&#x27;s mother. Only a single &quot;Udug-hul&quot; incantation instead refers to Namtar as a son of Enlil and Ereshkigal. A single late text, &quot;Underworld Vision of an Assyrian Prince&quot;, might also mention a feminine counterpart of Namtar, Namtartu, though the restoration of the name is uncertain.

As a disease demon, Namtar was often paired with Asag in incantations, with the two of them regarded as the most dangerous sources of diseases.

On occasion, the god Šulpae could be compared to Namtar, or even addressed with his name.

A single Old Babylonian letter associates Lugal-namtarra, a deity possibly analogous to Namtar, with Ninshubur, and invokes both of them to bless the recipient. Lugal-namtarra, as well as a deity whose name was written as dSUKKAL, who according to Odette Boivin might be analogous to Ninshubur, both appear in association with Shamash in texts from the archives of the First Sealand dynasty in place of his usual attendants (such as Bunene).

==Mythology==
Namtar appears in the role of Ereshkigal&#x27;s sukkal in the myth &quot;Nergal and Ereshkigal&quot;. As the queen of the land of the dead cannot travel to heaven, he partakes in a banquet taking place there as her representative. While most of the gathered gods pay respect to him, Nergal refuses to, which is the reason behind Ereshkigal&#x27;s demand to have him sent down to the underworld. Later Namtar is sent to heaven once again to bring Nergal back after he escapes from the underworld while Ereshkigal is asleep.

Another myth casting him in the same role is &quot;Ishtar&#x27;s Descent&quot;, where Ereshkigal tasks him with inflicting her sister Ishtar with sixty diseases, and later with reviving her and leading her back to the world of the living to find a substitute. This element of the story is absent from the earlier Sumerian myth &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot;, in which Namtar is not mentioned and Inanna dies as a result of a verdict of divine judges.

In &quot;Atrahasis&quot;, Enlil initially plans to rely on Namtar to deal with noise created by mankind.

In the myth &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot; Namtar is mentioned in passing as one of the gods invited to the banquet celebrating the creation of mankind.

<text>A self-driving car, also known as a autonomous car (AC), driverless car, robotaxi, robotic car or robo-car, is a car that is capable of operating with reduced or no human input. Self-driving cars are responsible for all driving activities, such as perceiving the environment, monitoring important systems, and controlling the vehicle, which includes navigating from origin to destination.

, no system has achieved full autonomy (SAE Level 5). In December 2020, Waymo was the first to offer rides in self-driving taxis to the public in limited geographic areas (SAE Level 4), and offers services in Arizona (Phoenix) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles). In June 2024, after a Waymo self-driving taxi crashed into a utility pole in Phoenix, Arizona, all 672 of its Jaguar I-Pace were recalled after they were found to have susceptibility to crashing into pole-like items and had their software updated. In July 2021, DeepRoute.ai started offering self-driving taxi rides in Shenzhen, China. Starting in February 2022, Cruise offered self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, but suspended service in 2023. In 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell an SAE Level 3 car, followed by Mercedes-Benz in 2023.


== History ==

Experiments have been conducted on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) since at least the 1920s. The first ADAS system was cruise control, which was invented in 1948 by Ralph Teetor.

Trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-autonomous car was developed in 1977, by Japan&#x27;s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. It required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds of with the support of an elevated rail.

Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Navlab and ALV semi-autonomous projects launched in the 1980s, funded by the United States&#x27; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich&#x27;s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987. By 1985, ALV had reached , on two-lane roads. Obstacle avoidance came in 1986, and day and night off-road driving by 1987. In 1995 Navlab 5 completed the first autonomous US coast-to-coast journey. Traveling from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 98.2% of the trip was autonomous. It completed the trip at an average speed of . Until the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence, controls, and sensor systems.

The US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving, combining highway-embedded automation with vehicle technology, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997. Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, Navlab drove across the US in 1995, or 98% autonomously. In 2015, Delphi piloted a Delphi technology-based Audi, over through 15 states, 99% autonomously. In 2015, Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, Michigan, and Washington DC allowed autonomous car testing on public roads.

From 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded development for connected and automated driving through Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT programs. The Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.

In November 2017, Waymo announced testing of autonomous cars without a safety driver. However, an employee was in the car to handle emergencies.

In March 2018, Elaine Herzberg became the first reported pedestrian killed by a self-driving car, an Uber test vehicle with a human backup driver; prosecutors did not charge Uber, while the human driver was sentenced to probation.

In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a robotaxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona. In October 2020, Waymo launched a robotaxi service in a (geofenced) part of the area. The cars were monitored in real-time, and remote engineers intervened to handle exceptional conditions.

In March 2019, ahead of Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record as the world&#x27;s fastest autonomous car. Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph).

In March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with Level 3 &quot;Traffic Jam Pilot&quot; driving technology, which legally allowed drivers to take their eyes off the road when the car was travelling under .

In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona. Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021. DeepRoute.ai launched robotaxi service in Shenzhen in July 2021. In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car. In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco. In December 2022, several manufacturers scaled back plans for self-driving technology, including Ford and Volkswagen. In 2023, Cruise suspended its robotaxi service. Nuro was approved for Level 4 in Palo Alto in August, 2023.

, vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor; as of early 2024, Honda leases a Level 3 car in Japan, and Mercedes sells two Level 3 cars in Germany, California and Nevada.

== Definitions ==

Organizations such as SAE have proposed terminology standards. However, most terms have no standard definition and are employed variously by vendors and others. Proposals to adopt aviation automation terminology for cars have not prevailed.

Names such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot are used even though the products offer an assortment of features that may not match the names. Despite offering a system dubbed &quot;Full Self-Driving&quot;, Tesla stated that its system did not autonomously handle all driving tasks. In the United Kingdom, a fully self-driving car is defined as a car so registered, rather than one that supports a specific feature set. The Association of British Insurers claimed that the usage of the word &quot;autonomous&quot; in marketing was dangerous because car ads make motorists think &quot;autonomous&quot; and &quot;autopilot&quot; imply that the driver can rely on the car to control itself, even though they do not.

=== Automated driving system ===

SAE identified 6 levels for driving automation from level 0 to level 5. An ADS is an SAE J3016 level 3 or higher system.

=== Advanced driver assistance system ===

An ADAS is a system that automates specific driving features, such as Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) or Blind Spot Warning (BSW). An ADAS requires a human driver to handle tasks that the ADAS does not support.

=== Autonomy versus automation ===
Autonomy implies that an automation system is under the control of the vehicle rather than a driver. Automation is function-specific, handling issues such as speed control, but leaves broader decision-making to the driver.

Euro NCAP defined autonomous as &quot;the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident&quot;.

In Europe, the words &quot;automated&quot; and &quot;autonomous&quot; can be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 supplied:
* &quot;automated vehicle&quot; means a vehicle that can move without continuous driver supervision, but that driver intervention is still expected or required in the operational design domains (ODD);
* &quot;fully automated vehicle&quot; means a vehicle that can move entirely without driver supervision;

===Cooperative system===

A remote driver is a driver that operates a vehicle at a distance, using a video and data connection.

According to SAE J3016, 

=== Operational design domain ===
Vendors have taken a variety of approaches to the self-driving problem. Tesla&#x27;s approach is to allow their &quot;full self-driving&quot; (FSD) system to be used in all ODDs as a Level 2 (hands/on, eyes/on) ADAS. Waymo picked specific ODDs (city streets in Phoenix and San Francisco) for their Level 5 robotaxi service. Mercedes Benz offers Level 3 service in Las Vegas in highway traffic jams at speeds up to . Mobileye&#x27;s SuperVision system offers hands-off/eyes-on driving on all road types at speeds up to . GM&#x27;s hands-free Super Cruise operates on specific roads in specific conditions, stopping or returning control to the driver when ODD changes. In 2024 the company announced plans to expand road coverage from 400,000 miles to 750,000 miles. Ford&#x27;s BlueCruise hands-off system operates on 130,000 miles of US divided highways.

=== Self-driving ===
The Union of Concerned Scientists defined self-driving as &quot;cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or &#x27;driverless&#x27; cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.&quot;

The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as &quot;driving itself&quot; if the vehicle is &quot;not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual&quot;.

Another British government definition stated, &quot;Self-driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves&quot;.

=== British definitions ===
In British English, the word automated alone has several meanings, such as in the sentence: &quot;Thatcham also found that the &quot;automated&quot; lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as &#x27;automated driving&#x27;, preferring &#x27;assisted driving&#x27;&quot;. The first occurrence of the &quot;automated&quot; word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. British law interprets the meaning of &quot;automated vehicle&quot; based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle &quot;driving itself&quot; and an insured vehicle.

In November 2023 the British Government introduced the Automated Vehicles Bill. It proposed definitions for related terms:
* Self-driving: &quot;A vehicle “satisfies the self-driving test” if it is designed or adapted with the intention that a feature of the vehicle will allow it to travel autonomously, and it is capable of doing so, by means of that feature, safely and legally.&quot;
* Autonomy: A vehicle travels &quot;autonomously&quot; if it is controlled by the vehicle, and neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are monitored by a person who can intervene.
* Control: control of vehicle motion.
* Safe: a vehicle that conforms to an acceptably safe standard.
* Legal: a vehicle that offers an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction.

=== SAE classification ===
A six-level classification system – ranging from fully manual to fully automated – was published in 2014 by SAE International as J3016, &quot;Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems&quot;; the details are revised occasionally. This classification is based on the role of the driver, rather than the vehicle&#x27;s capabilities, although these are related. After SAE updated its classification in 2016, (J3016_201609), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) adopted the SAE standard. The classification is a topic of debate, with various revisions proposed.

==== Classifications ====
A &quot;driving mode&quot;, aka driving scenario, combines an ODD with matched driving requirements (e.g., expressway merging, traffic jam). Cars may switch levels in accord with the driving mode.

Above Level 1, level differences are related to how responsibility for safe movement is divided/shared between ADAS and driver rather than specific driving features. 

SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not be the case. SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure and road user behavior.

=== Mobileye System ===

Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua and CTO Shai Shalev-Shwartz proposed an alternative taxonomy for autonomous driving systems, claiming that a more consumer-friendly approach was needed. Its categories reflect the amount of driver engagement that is required. Some vehicle makers have informally adopted some of the terminology involved, while not formally committing to it.

==== Eyes-on/hands-on ====
The first level, hands-on/eyes-on, implies that the driver is fully engaged in operating the vehicle, but is supervised by the system, which intervenes according to the features it supports (e.g., adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking). The driver is entirely responsible, with hands on the wheel, and eyes on the road.

==== Eyes-on/hands-off ====
Eyes-on/hands-off allows the driver to let go of the wheel. The system drives, the driver monitors and remains prepared to resume control as needed.

==== Eyes-off/hands-off ====
Eyes-off/hands-off means that the driver can stop monitoring the system, leaving the system in full control. Eyes-off requires that no errors be reproducible (not triggered by exotic transitory conditions) or frequent, that speeds are contextually appropriate (e.g., 80 mph on limited-access roads), and that the system handle typical maneuvers (e.g., getting cut off by another vehicle). The automation level could vary according to the road (e.g., eyes-off on freeways, eyes-on on side streets).

==== No driver ====
The highest level does not require a human driver in the car: monitoring is done either remotely (telepresence) or not at all.

==== Safety ====
A critical requirement for the higher two levels is that the vehicle be able to conduct a Minimum Risk Maneuver and stop safely out of traffic without driver intervention.

== Technology ==
=== Architecture ===
The perception system processes visual and audio data from outside and inside the car to create a local model of the vehicle, the road, traffic, traffic controls and other observable objects, and their relative motion. The control system then takes actions to move the vehicle, considering the local model, road map, and driving regulations.

Several classifications have been proposed to describe ADAS technology. One proposal is to adopt these categories: navigation, path planning, perception, and car control.

=== Navigation ===

Navigation involves the use of maps to define a path between origin and destination. Hybrid navigation is the use of multiple navigation systems. Some systems use basic maps, relying on perception to deal with anomalies. Such a map understands which roads lead to which others, whether a road is a freeway, a highway, are one-way, etc. Other systems require highly detailed maps, including lane maps, obstacles, traffic controls, etc.

==== Perception ====
ACs need to be able to perceive the world around them. Supporting technologies include combinations of cameras, LiDAR, radar, audio, and ultrasound, GPS, and inertial measurement. Deep neural networks are used to analyse inputs from these sensors to detect and identify objects and their trajectories. Some systems use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Another technique is detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), used to handle potential obstacles. Other systems use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Tesla&#x27;s &quot;vision only&quot; system uses eight cameras, without LIDAR or radar, to create its bird&#x27;s-eye view of the environment.

==== Path planning ====
Path planning finds a sequence of segments that a vehicle can use to move from origin to destination. Techniques used for path planning include graph-based search and variational-based optimization techniques. Graph-based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle/obstacle. Variational-based optimization techniques require more stringent restrictions on the vehicle&#x27;s path to prevent collisions. The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram, an occupancy grid mapping, or a driving corridor algorithm. The latter allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open space that is bounded by lanes or barriers.

==== Maps ====
Maps are necessary for navigation. Map sophistication varies from simple graphs that show which roads connect to each other, with details such as one-way vs two-way, to those that are highly detailed, with information about lanes, traffic controls, roadworks, and more. Researchers at the MITComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive with simple maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a &quot;sparse topological map&quot; such as OpenStreetMap (which has only 2D road features), with sensors that observe road conditions. One issue with highly-detailed maps is updating them as the world changes. Vehicles that can operate with less-detailed maps do not require frequent updates or geo-fencing.

==== Sensors ====
Sensors are necessary for the vehicle to properly respond to the driving environment. Sensor types include cameras, LiDAR, ultrasound, and radar. Control systems typically combine data from multiple sensors. Multiple sensors can provide a more complete view of the surroundings and can be used to cross-check each other to correct errors. For example, radar can image a scene in, e.g., a nighttime snowstorm, that defeats cameras and LiDAR, albeit at reduced precision. After experimenting with radar and ultrasound, Tesla adopted a vision-only approach, asserting that humans drive using only vision, and that cars should be able to do the same, while citing the lower cost of cameras versus other sensor types. By contrast, Waymo makes use of the higher resolution of LiDAR sensors and cites the declining cost of that technology.

=== Drive by wire ===

Drive by wire is the use of electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions such as steering or speed control that are traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages.

=== Driver monitoring ===

Driver monitoring is used to assess the driver&#x27;s attention and alertness. Techniques in use include eye monitoring, and requiring the driver to maintain torque on the steering wheel. It attempts to understand driver status and identify dangerous driving behaviors.

=== Vehicle communication ===

Vehicles can potentially benefit from communicating with others to share information about traffic, road obstacles, to receive map and software updates, etc.

ISO/TC 22 specifies in-vehicle transport information and control systems, while ISO/TC 204 specifies information, communication and control systems in surface transport. International standards have been developed for ADAS functions, connectivity, human interaction, in-vehicle systems, management/engineering, dynamic map and positioning, privacy and security.

Rather than communicating among vehicles, they can communicate with road-based systems to receive similar information.

=== Software update ===

Software controls the vehicle, and can provide entertainment and other services. Over-the-air updates can deliver bug fixes and additional features over the internet. Software updates are one way to accomplish recalls that in the past required a visit to a service center. In March 2021, the UNECE regulation on software update and software update management systems was published.

=== Safety model ===
A safety model is software that attempts to formalize rules that ensure that ACs operate safely.

IEEE is attempting to forge a standard for safety models as &quot;IEEE P2846: A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making&quot;. In 2022, a research group at National Institute of Informatics (NII, Japan) enhanced Mobileye&#x27;s Reliable Safety System as &quot;Goal-Aware RSS&quot; to enable RSS rules to deal with complex scenarios via program logic.

=== Notification ===
The US has standardized the use of turquoise lights to inform other drivers that a vehicle is driving autonomously. It will be used in the 2026 Mercedes-Benz EQS and S-Class sedans with Drive Pilot, an SAE Level 3 driving system.

As of 2023, the Turquoise light had not been standardized by the P.R.C or the UN-ECE.

=== Artificial Intelligence ===
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), enabling them to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely without human intervention. AI algorithms empower AVs to interpret sensory data from various onboard sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS, to understand their environment and improve its technological ability and overall safety over time.

== Challenges ==
=== Obstacles ===
The primary obstacle to ACs is the advanced software and mapping required to make them work safely across the wide variety of conditions that drivers experience. In addition to handling day/night driving in good and bad weather on roads of arbitrary quality, ACs must cope with other vehicles, road obstacles, poor/missing traffic controls, flawed maps, and handle endless edge cases, such as following the instructions of a police officer managing traffic at a crash site.

Other obstacles include cost, liability, consumer reluctance, ethical dilemmas, security, privacy, and legal/regulatory framework. Further, AVs could automate the work of professional drivers, eliminating many jobs, which could slow acceptance.

=== Concerns ===

==== Deceptive marketing ====
Tesla calls its Level 2 ADAS &quot;Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta&quot;. US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate this marketing in 2021. In December 2021 in Japan, Mercedes-Benz was punished by the Consumer Affairs Agency for misleading product descriptions.

Mercedes-Benz was criticized for a misleading US commercial advertising E-Class models. At that time, Mercedes-Benz rejected the claims and stopped its &quot;self-driving car&quot; ad campaign that had been running. In August 2022, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices.

With the Automated Vehicles Bill (AVB) self-driving car-makers could face prison for misleading adverts in the United-Kingdom.

==== Security ====
In the 2020s, concerns over ACs&#x27; vulnerability to cyberattacks and data theft emerged.

==== Espionage ====
In 2018 and 2019 former Apple engineers were charged with stealing information related to Apple&#x27;s self-driving car project. In 2021 the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) accused Chinese security officials of coordinating a hacking campaign to steal information from government entities, including research related to autonomous vehicles. China has prepared &quot;the Provisions on Management of Automotive Data Security (Trial) to protect its own data&quot;.

Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything technologies are based on 5G wireless networks. , the US Congress was considering the possibility that imported Chinese AC technology could facilitate espionage.

Testing of Chinese automated cars in the US has raised concern over which US data are collected by Chinese vehicles to be stored in Chinese country and concern with any link with the Chinese communist party.

==== Driver communications ====
ACs complicate the need for drivers to communicate with each other, e.g., to decide which car enters an intersection first. In an AC without a driver, traditional means such as hand signals do not work (no driver, no hands).

==== Behavior prediction ====
ACs must be able to predict the behavior of possibly moving vehicles, pedestrians, etc in real time in order to proceed safely. The task becomes more challenging the further into the future the prediction extends, requiring rapid revisions to the estimate to cope with unpredicted behavior. One approach is to wholly recompute the position and trajectory of each object many times per second. Another is to cache the results of an earlier prediction for use in the next one to reduce computational complexity.

==== Handover ====
The ADAS has to be able to safely accept control from and return control to the driver.

==== Trust ====
Consumers will avoid ACs unless they trust them as safe. Robotaxis operating in San Francisco received pushback over perceived safety risks. Automatic elevators were invented in 1900, but did not become common until operator strikes and trust was built with advertising and features such as an emergency stop button. However, with repeated use of autonomous driving functions, drivers&#x27; behavior and trust in autonomous vehicles gradually improved and both entered a more stable state. At the same time this also improved the performance and reliability of the vehicle in complex conditions, thereby increasing public trust.

==== Economics ====
Autonomous also present various political and economic implications. The transportation sector holds significant sway in many the political and economic landscapes. For instance, many US states generates much annual revenue from transportation fees and taxes. The advent of self-driving cars could profoundly affect the economy by potentially altering state tax revenue streams. Furthermore, the transition to autonomous vehicles might disrupt employment patterns and labor markets, particularly in industries heavily reliant on driving professions. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that in 2019, the sector employed over two million individuals as tractor-trailer truck drivers. Additionally, taxi and delivery drivers represented approximately 370,400 positions, and bus drivers constituted a workforce of over 680,000. Collectively, this amounts to a conceivable displacement of nearly 2.9 million jobs, surpassing the job losses experienced in the 2008 Great Recession.

==== Equity and Inclusion ====
The prominence of certain demographic groups within the tech industry inevitably shapes the trajectory of autonomous vehicle (AV) development, potentially perpetuating existing inequalities. There are others in society without a political agenda who believe that the advancement of technology has nothing to do with promoting inequalities in certain groups and see this as a ridiculous presumption.

=== Ethical issues ===
==== Pedestrian Detection ====
Research from Georgia Tech revealed that autonomous vehicle detection systems were generally five percent less effective at recognizing darker-skinned individuals. This accuracy gap persisted despite adjustments for environmental variables like lighting and visual obstructions.

==== Rationale for liability ====
Standards for liability have yet to be adopted to address crashes and other incidents. Liability could rest with the vehicle occupant, its owner, the vehicle manufacturer, or even the ADAS technology supplier, possibly depending on the circumstances of the crash. Additionally, the infusion of ArtificiaI Intelligence technology in autonomous vehicles adds layers of complexity to ownership and ethical dynamics. Given that AI systems are inherently self-learning, a question arises of whether accountability should rest with the vehicle owner, the manufacturer, or the AI developer?

==== Trolley problem ====
The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. Adapted for ACs, it considers an AC carrying one passenger confronts a pedestrian who steps in its way. The ADAS notionally has to choose between killing the pedestrian or swerving into a wall, killing the passenger. Possible frameworks include deontology (formal rules) and utilitarianism (harm reduction).

One public opinion survey reported that harm reduction was preferred, except that passengers wanted the vehicle to prefer them, while pedestrians took the opposite view. Utilitarian regulations were unpopular. Additionally, cultural viewpoints exert substantial influence on shaping responses to these ethical quandaries. Another study found that cultural biases impact preferences in prioritizing the rescue of certain individuals over others in car accident scenarios.

==== Privacy ====
Some ACs require an internet connection to function, opening the possibility that a hacker might gain access to private information such as destinations, routes, camera recordings, media preferences, and/or behavioral patterns, although this is true of an internet-connected device.

=== Road infrastructure ===
ACs make use of road infrastructure (e.g., traffic signs, turn lanes) and may require modifications to that infrastructure to fully achieve their safety and other goals. In March 2023, the Japanese government unveiled a plan to set up a dedicated highway lane for ACs. In April 2023, JR East announced their challenge to raise their self-driving level of Kesennuma Line bus rapid transit (BRT) in rural area from the current Level 2 to Level 4 at 60 km/h.

== Testing ==
=== Approaches ===
ACs can be tested via digital simulations, in a controlled test environment, and/or on public roads. Road testing typically requires some form of permit or a commitment to adhere to acceptable operating principles. For example, New York requires a test driver to be in the vehicle, prepared to override the ADAS as necessary.

=== 2010s and disengagements ===

In California, self-driving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports describing how often their vehicles autonomously disengaged from autonomous mode. This is one measure of system robustness (ideally, the system should never disengage).

In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over of testing, an average distance of between disengagements, the highest (best) among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also logged more autonomous miles than other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (owned by GM) averaged per disengagement over .

=== 2020s ===

==== Disengagement definitions ====
Reporting companies use varying definitions of what qualifies as a disengagement, and such definitions can change over time. Executives of self-driving car companies have criticized disengagements as a deceptive metric, because it does not consider varying road conditions.

==== Standards ====
In April 2021, WP.29 GRVA proposed a &quot;Test Method for Automated Driving (NATM)&quot;.

In October 2021, Europe&#x27;s pilot test, L3Pilot, demonstrated ADAS for cars in Hamburg, Germany, in conjunction with ITS World Congress 2021. SAE Level 3 and 4 functions were tested on ordinary roads.

In November 2022, an International Standard ISO 34502 on &quot;Scenario based safety evaluation framework&quot; was published.

==== Collision avoidance ====
In April 2022, collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by Nissan. Waymo published a document about collision avoidance testing in December 2022.

==== Simulation and validation ====
In September 2022, Biprogy released Driving Intelligence Validation Platform (DIVP) as part of Japanese national project &quot;SIP-adus&quot;, which is interoperable with Open Simulation Interface (OSI) of ASAM.

==== Toyota ====
In November 2022, Toyota demonstrated one of its GR Yaris test cars, which had been trained using professional rally drivers. Toyota used its collaboration with Microsoft in FIA World Rally Championship since the 2017 season.

==== Pedestrian reactions ====
In 2023 David R. Large, senior research fellow with the Human Factors Research Group at the University of Nottingham, disguised himself as a car seat in a study to test people&#x27;s reactions to driverless cars. He said, &quot;We wanted to explore how pedestrians would interact with a driverless car and developed this unique methodology to explore their reactions.&quot; The study found that, in the absence of someone in the driving seat, pedestrians trust certain visual prompts more than others when deciding whether to cross the road.

== Incidents ==
=== Tesla ===
As of 2023, Tesla&#x27;s ADAS Autopilot/Full Self Driving (beta) was classified as Level 2 ADAS.

On 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred, in China&#x27;s Hubei province. Initially, Tesla stated that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to determine whether the car had been on Autopilot at the time. However, the car failed to take evasive action.

Another fatal Autopilot crash occurred in May in Florida in a Tesla Model S that crashed into a tractor-trailer. In a civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla documented that the car had been on Autopilot. According to Tesla, &quot;neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.&quot; Tesla claimed that this was Tesla&#x27;s first known Autopilot death in over with Autopilot engaged. Tesla claimed that on average one fatality occurs every across all vehicle types in the US. However, this number also includes motorcycle/pedestrian fatalities. The ultimate National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.

In February 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck crashed while in Full-Self Driving mode, raising concerns about autonomous driving and prompting an investigation from Tesla who said the crash would be probed &quot;“in line with standard protocol when any of our electric vehicles are involved in an accident while in FSD mode.” 

=== Google Waymo ===
In June 2015, Google confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, in two of which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled a stop sign, and one where a driver was controlling the car manually. In July 2015, three employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake. This was the first collision that resulted in injuries.

According to Google Waymo&#x27;s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car&#x27;s software caused a crash. On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, &quot;In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn&#x27;t moved, there wouldn&#x27;t have been a collision.&quot; Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported.

=== Uber&#x27;s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) ===
In March 2018, Elaine Herzberg died after she was hit by an AC tested by Uber&#x27;s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) in Arizona. A safety driver was in the car. Herzberg was crossing the road about 400 feet from an intersection. Some experts said a human driver could have avoided the crash. Arizona governor Doug Ducey suspended the company&#x27;s ability to test its ACs citing an &quot;unquestionable failure&quot; of Uber to protect public safety. Uber also stopped testing in California until receiving a new permit in 2020.

NTSB&#x27;s final report determined that the immediate cause of the accident was that safety driver Rafaela Vasquez failed to monitor the road, because she was distracted by her phone, but that Uber&#x27;s &quot;inadequate safety culture&quot; contributed. The report noted that the victim had &quot;a very high level&quot; of methamphetamine in her body. The board called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads.

In September 2020, Vasquez pled guilty to endangerment and was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation.

=== NIO Navigate on Pilot ===
On 12 August 2021, a 31-year-old Chinese man was killed after his NIO ES8 collided with a construction vehicle. NIO&#x27;s self-driving feature was in beta and could not deal with static obstacles. The vehicle&#x27;s manual clearly stated that the driver must take over near construction sites. Lawyers of the deceased&#x27;s family questioned NIO&#x27;s private access to the vehicle, which they argued did not guarantee the integrity of the data.

=== Pony.ai ===
The permit was issued and they actually have fifty permits now. In May 2022, DMV revoked Pony.ai&#x27;s permit for failing to monitor the driving records of its safety drivers.

=== Cruise ===

In April 2022, Cruise&#x27;s testing vehicle was reported to have blocked a fire engine on emergency call, and sparked questions about its ability to handle unexpected circumstances.

=== Ford ===
In February 2024, a driver using the Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving feature struck and killed the driver of a stationary car with no lights on in the middle lane of a freeway in Texas.

In March 2024, a drunk driver who was speeding, holding her cell phone, and using BlueCruise on a Pennsylvania freeway struck and killed two people who had been driving two cars. The first car had become disabled and was on the left shoulder with part of the car in the left driving lane. The second driver had parked his car behind the first car presumably to help the first driver.

The NTSB is investigating both incidents.

=== Total incidents ===
The NHTSA began mandating incident reports from autonomous vehicle companies in June 2021. Some reports cite incidents from as early as August 2019, with current data available through June 17, 2024.

There have been a total of 3,979 autonomous vehicle incidents (both ADS and ADAS) reported during this timeframe. 2,146 of those incidents (53.9%) involved Tesla vehicles.

== Public opinion surveys ==

=== 2010s ===
In a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers, 49% said they would be comfortable using a &quot;driverless car&quot;.

A 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners found 37% who initially said they would be interested in purchasing a &quot;fully autonomous car&quot;. However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.

In a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers, 22% had a positive attitude, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.

A 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries found 57% &quot;stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver&quot;, with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.

In a 2014 US telephone survey, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available.

In 2015, a survey of 5,000 people from 109 countries reported that average respondents found manual driving the most enjoyable. 22% did not want to pay more money for autonomy. Respondents were found to be most concerned about hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries were less comfortable with their vehicle sharing data. The survey reported consumer interest in purchasing an AC, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either &quot;definitely&quot; or &quot;probably&quot; interested.

In 2016, a survey of 1,603 people in Germany that controlled for age, gender, and education reported that men felt less anxiety and more enthusiasm, whereas women showed the opposite. The difference was pronounced between young men and women and decreased with age.

In a 2016 US survey of 1,584 people, &quot;66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver&quot;. People were worried about safety and hacking risk. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees saw no advantages in this new kind of cars.

In a 2017 survey of 4,135 US adults found that many Americans anticipated significant impacts from various automation technologies including the widespread adoption of automated vehicles.

In 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. The questionnaire was termed the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM), including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of various automation levels. Users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.

=== In the 2020s ===
In 2022, a survey reported that only a quarter (27%) of the world&#x27;s population would feel safe in self-driving cars.

In 2024, a study by Saravanos et al. at New York University reported that 87% of their respondents (from a sample of 358) believed that conditionally automated cars (at Level 3) would be easy to use.

Opinion surveys may have little salience given that few respondents had any personal experience with ACs.

== Regulation ==
The regulation of autonomous cars concerns liability, approvals, and international conventions.

In the 2010s, researchers openly worried that delayed regulations could delay deployment. In 2020, UNECE WP.29 GRVA was issued to address regulation of Level 3 automated driving.

== Commercialization ==

Vehicles operating below Level 5 still offer many advantages.

 most commercially available ADAS vehicles are SAE Level 2. A couple of companies reached higher levels, but only in restricted (geofenced) locations.

=== Level 2 – Partial Automation ===

SAE Level 2 features are available as part of the ADAS systems in many vehicles. In the US, 50% of new cars provide driver assistance for both steering and speed.

Ford started offering BlueCruise service on certain vehicles in 2022; the system is named ActiveGlide in Lincoln vehicles. The system provided features such as lane centering, street sign recognition, and hands-free highway driving on more than 130,000 miles of divided highways. The 2022 1.2 version added features including hands-free lane changing, in-lane repositioning, and predictive speed assist. In April 2023 BlueCruise was approved in the UK for use on certain motorways, starting with 2023 models of Ford&#x27;s electric Mustang Mach-E SUV.

Tesla&#x27;s Autopilot and its Full Self-Driving (FSD) ADAS suites are available on all Tesla cars since 2016. FSD offers highway and street driving (without geofencing), navigation/turn management, steering, and dynamic cruise control, collision avoidance, lane-keeping/switching, emergency braking, obstacle avoidance, but still requires the driver to remain ready to control the vehicle at any moment. Its driver management system combines eye tracking with monitoring pressure on the steering wheel to ensure that drives are both eyes on and hands on.

Tesla&#x27;s FSD rewrite V12 (released in March 2024) uses a single deep learning transformer model for all aspects of perception, monitoring, and control. It relies on its eight cameras for its vision-only perception system, without use of LiDAR, radar, or ultrasound. As of April 2024, FSD has been deployed on two million Tesla cars. As of January 2024, Tesla has not initiated requests for Level 3 status for its systems and has not disclosed its reason for not doing so.

==== Development ====
General Motors is developing the &quot;Ultra Cruise&quot; ADAS system, that will be a dramatic improvement over their current &quot;Super Cruise&quot; system. Ultra Cruise will cover &quot;95 percent&quot; of driving scenarios on 2 million miles of roads in the US, according to the company. The system hardware in and around the car includes multiple cameras, short- and long-range radar, and a LiDAR sensor, and will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Platform. The luxury Cadillac Celestiq electric vehicle will be one of the first vehicles to feature Ultra Cruise.

Europe is developing a new &quot;Driver Control Assistance Systems&quot; (DCAS) level 2 regulation to no longer limit the use of lane changing systems to roads with 2 lanes and a physical separation from traffic in the opposite direction.

=== Level 3 – Conditional Automation ===
, two car manufacturers have sold or leased Level 3 cars: Honda in Japan, and Mercedes in Germany, Nevada and California.

Mercedes Drive Pilot has been available on the EQS and S-class sedan in Germany since 2022, and in California and Nevada since 2023. A subscription costs between €5,000 and €7,000 for three years in Germany and $2,500 for one year in the United States. Drive Pilot can only be used when the vehicle is traveling under , there is a vehicle in front, readable line markings, during the day, clear weather, and on freeways mapped by Mercedes down to the centimeter (100,000 miles in California). As of April 2024, one Mercedes vehicle with this capability has been sold in California.

==== Development ====
Honda continued to enhance its Level 3 technology. As of 2023, 80 vehicles with Level 3 support had been sold.

Mercedes-Benz received authorization in early 2023 to pilot its Level 3 software in Las Vegas. California also authorized Drive Pilot in 2023.

BMW commercialized its AC in 2021. In 2023 BMW stated that its Level-3 technology was nearing release. It would be the second manufacturer to deliver Level-3 technology, but the only one with a Level 3 technology which works in the dark.

In 2023, in China, IM Motors, Mercedes, and BMW obtained authorization to test vehicles with Level 3 systems on motorways.

In September 2021, Stellantis presented its findings from its Level 3 pilot testing on Italian highways. Stellantis&#x27;s Highway Chauffeur claimed Level 3 capabilities, as tested on the Maserati Ghibli and Fiat 500X prototypes.

Polestar, a Volvo Cars&#x27; brand, announced in January 2022 its plan to offer Level 3 autonomous driving system in the Polestar 3 SUV, a Volvo XC90 successor, with technologies from Luminar Technologies, Nvidia, and Zenseact.

In January 2022, Bosch and the Volkswagen Group subsidiary CARIAD released a collaboration for autonomous driving up to Level 3. This joint development targets Level 4 capabilities.

Hyundai Motor Company is enhancing cybersecurity of connected cars to offer a Level 3 self-driving Genesis G90. Kia and Hyundai Korean car makers delayed their Level 3 plans, and will not deliver Level 3 vehicles in 2023.

=== Level 4 – High Automation ===
Waymo offers robotaxi services in parts of Arizona (Phoenix) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles), as fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers.

In April 2023 in Japan, a Level 4 protocol became part of the amended Road Traffic Act. ZEN drive Pilot Level 4 made by AIST operates there.

==== Development ====
In July 2020, Toyota started public demonstration rides on Lexus LS (fifth generation) based TRI-P4 with Level 4 capability. In August 2021, Toyota operated a potentially Level 4 service using e-Palette around the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Village.

In September 2020, Mercedes-Benz introduced world&#x27;s first commercial Level 4 Automated Valet Parking (AVP) system named &quot;Intelligent Park Pilot&quot; for its new S-Class. In November 2022, Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) approved the system for use at Stuttgart Airport.

In September 2021, Cruise, General Motors, and Honda started a joint testing programme, using Cruise AV. In 2023, the Origin was put on indefinite hold following Cruise&#x27;s loss of its operating permit.

In January 2023, Holon announced an autonomous shuttle during the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The company claimed that the vehicle is the world&#x27;s first Level 4 shuttle built to automotive standard.

<text>In computer science, shadow paging is a technique for providing atomicity and durability (two of the ACID properties) in database systems. A &quot;page&quot; in this context refers to a unit of physical storage (probably on a hard disk), typically of the order of 1 to 64 KiB.

Shadow paging is a copy-on-write technique for avoiding in-place updates of pages. Instead, when a page is to be modified, a &quot;shadow page&quot; is allocated. Since the shadow page has no references (from other pages on disk), it can be modified liberally, without concern for consistency constraints, etc. When the page is ready to become durable, all pages that referred to the original are updated to refer to the new replacement page instead. Because the page is &quot;activated&quot; only when it is ready, it is atomic.

If the referring pages must also be updated via shadow paging, this procedure may recurse many times, becoming quite costly. One solution, employed by the Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL) file system, is to be lazy about making pages durable (i.e., write-behind caching). This increases performance significantly by avoiding many writes on hotspots high up in the referential hierarchy (e.g., a file system superblock) at the cost of high commit latency.

Write-ahead logging is a more popular solution that uses in-place updates.

Shadow paging is similar to the old master–new master batch processing technique used in mainframe database systems. In these systems, the output of each batch run (possibly a day&#x27;s work) was written to two separate disks or other form of storage medium. One was kept for backup, and the other was used as the starting point for the next day&#x27;s work.

Shadow paging is also similar to purely functional data structures, in that in-place updates are avoided.

<text>Women Thrive Alliance, formerly Women Thrive Worldwide and Women&#x27;s Edge, is a global feminist advocacy network created in 1998 that advocates for gender equality. Working with the grassroots organizations in 53 countries.

Emily Bove is the Executive Director of Women Thrive Alliance.

Women Thrive Alliance&#x27;s total support and revenue for 2017 were US$871,955.00.

In 2005, Amnesty International USA and Women Thrive Worldwide organized meetings with members of the United States Senate to work toward legislation to combat violence against women and girls around the world. These meetings led to the 2007 International Violence Against Women Act, which was introduced by Senators Joseph Biden and Richard Lugar.

Women Thrive Worldwide has lobbied and helped pass such legislation as the Access for Afghan Women Act, the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act, the GAINS for Women and Girls Act, the Trade Impact Review and the GROWTH Act.

Ritu Sharma Fox is co-founder and the president. USAID calls her &quot;a leading voice on international women&#x27;s issues and U.S. foreign policy.&quot;

According to USAID, &quot;due in large part&quot; to Women Thrive Worldwide, &quot;the interests of poor women worldwide are now being incorporated into U.S. economic assistance and trade policies and, in some cases, into U.S. law itself.

<text>John Torrence Tate Jr. (March 13, 1925 – October 16, 2019) was an American mathematician distinguished for many fundamental contributions in algebraic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and related areas in algebraic geometry. He was awarded the Abel Prize in 2010.

== Biography ==
Tate was born in Minneapolis, on March 13, 1925. His father, John Tate Sr., was a professor of physics at the University of Minnesota and a longtime editor of &quot;Physical Review&quot;. His mother, Lois Beatrice Fossler, was a high school English teacher. Tate Jr. received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1946 from Harvard University and entered the doctoral program in physics at Princeton University. He later transferred to the mathematics department and received his PhD in mathematics in 1950 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Fourier analysis in number fields and Hecke&#x27;s zeta functions&quot; under the supervision of Emil Artin. Tate taught at Harvard for 36 years before joining the University of Texas in 1990 as a Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair. He retired from the Texas mathematics department in 2009 and returned to Harvard as a professor emeritus.

Tate died at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts on October 16, 2019, aged 94.

== Mathematical work ==
Tate&#x27;s thesis (1950) on Fourier analysis in number fields has become one of the ingredients for the modern theory of automorphic forms and their L-functions, notably by its use of the adele ring, its self-duality and harmonic analysis on it; independently and a little earlier, Kenkichi Iwasawa obtained a similar theory. Together with his advisor Emil Artin, Tate gave a cohomological treatment of global class field theory using techniques of group cohomology applied to the idele class group and Galois cohomology. This treatment made more transparent some of the algebraic structures in the previous approaches to class field theory, which used central division algebras to compute the Brauer group of a global field.

Subsequently, Tate introduced what are now known as Tate cohomology groups. In the decades following that discovery he extended the reach of Galois cohomology with the Poitou–Tate duality, the Tate–Shafarevich group, and relations with algebraic K-theory. With Jonathan Lubin, he recast local class field theory by the use of formal groups, creating the Lubin–Tate local theory of complex multiplication.

He has also made a number of individual and important contributions to &quot;p&quot;-adic theory; for example, Tate&#x27;s invention of rigid analytic spaces can be said to have spawned the entire field of rigid analytic geometry. He found a &quot;p&quot;-adic analogue of Hodge theory, now called Hodge–Tate theory, which has blossomed into another central technique of modern algebraic number theory. Other innovations of his include the &quot;Tate curve&quot; parametrization for certain &quot;p&quot;-adic elliptic curves and the &quot;p&quot;-divisible (Tate–Barsotti) groups.

Many of his results were not immediately published and some of them were written up by Serge Lang, Jean-Pierre Serre, Joseph H. Silverman and others. Tate and Serre collaborated on a paper on good reduction of abelian varieties. The classification of abelian varieties over finite fields was carried out by Taira Honda and Tate (the Honda–Tate theorem).

The Tate conjectures are the equivalent for étale cohomology of the Hodge conjecture. They relate to the Galois action on the ℓ-adic cohomology of an algebraic variety, identifying a space of &quot;Tate cycles&quot; (the fixed cycles for a suitably Tate-twisted action) that conjecturally picks out the algebraic cycles. A special case of the conjectures, which are open in the general case, was involved in the proof of the Mordell conjecture by Gerd Faltings.

Tate has also had a major influence on the development of number theory through his role as a Ph.D. advisor. His students include George Bergman, Ted Chinburg, Bernard Dwork, Benedict Gross, Robert Kottwitz, Jonathan Lubin, Stephen Lichtenbaum, James Milne, V. Kumar Murty, Carl Pomerance, Ken Ribet, Joseph H. Silverman, Dinesh Thakur, and William C. Waterhouse.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1956, Tate was awarded the American Mathematical Society&#x27;s Cole Prize for outstanding contributions to number theory. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1969. In 1992, he was elected as Foreign Member of the French Academie des Sciences. In 1995, he received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement from the American Mathematical Society. He was awarded a Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2002/03 for his creation of fundamental concepts in algebraic number theory. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

In 2010, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, of which he was a member, awarded him the Abel Prize, citing &quot;his vast and lasting impact on the theory of numbers&quot;. According to a release by the Abel Prize committee, &quot;Many of the major lines of research in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry are only possible because of the incisive contributions and illuminating insights of John Tate. He has truly left a conspicuous imprint on modern mathematics.&quot;

Tate has been described as &quot;one of the seminal mathematicians for the past half-century&quot; by William Beckner, Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin.

== Personal life ==
Tate married twice. His first wife was Karin Artin, his doctoral advisor&#x27;s daughter. Together they had three daughters, six grandchildren, and a great-grandson. One of his grandchildren, Dustin Clausen, currently works as a mathematics Professor at Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques. After Tate divorced, he married Carol MacPherson.

<text>ALF is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from September 22, 1986, to March 24, 1990.

The titular character, ALF, an acronym for &quot;Alien Life Form&quot;, but whose real name is Gordon Shumway, crash-lands in the garage of the suburban California middle-class Tanner family. The series stars Max Wright as father Willie Tanner, Anne Schedeen as mother Kate Tanner, and Andrea Elson and Benji Gregory as their children, Lynn and Brian Tanner. ALF was performed by puppeteer Paul Fusco, who co-created the show with Tom Patchett. However, in scenes where he appeared in full body, he was performed by Michu Meszaros, who was uncredited in the role.

Produced by Alien Productions, &quot;ALF&quot; ran for four seasons and 97 episodes, including three one-hour episodes (&quot;Try to Remember&quot;, &quot;ALF&#x27;s Special Christmas&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;). These episodes were divided into two parts for syndication, for a total of 100 episodes. The series ended with an unresolved cliffhanger, but a television film, &quot;Project: ALF&quot;, was made later and served as a series finale for the franchise.

In August 2018, Warner Bros. Television announced the development of an &quot;ALF&quot; reboot, which was later canceled in November of that year. In February 2022, it was announced that Shout! Studios had acquired distribution rights to the &quot;ALF&quot; titles, and would &quot;develop new &quot;ALF&quot;-related content,&quot; with the company Maximum Effort subsequently joining in July 2023 to develop new material as well.

==Plot==
Gordon Shumway is an alien from the planet Melmac who follows an amateur radio signal to Earth and crash-lands into the garage of the Tanners, a suburban middle-class family who live in the San Fernando Valley area of California. The family consists of social worker Willie (Max Wright), his wife Kate (Anne Schedeen), their teenage daughter Lynn (Andrea Elson), younger son Brian (Benji Gregory), and pet cat Lucky- whom ALF wishes to consume.

Willie gives Gordon the nickname ALF (&quot;Alien Life Form&quot;), and, unsure what to do, the Tanners take ALF into their home to hide him from the Alien Task Force, a part of the U.S. military that specializes in aliens, and their nosy neighbors Trevor and Raquel Ochmonek (John La Motta and Liz Sheridan), until he can repair his spacecraft. Though his culture shock, survivor&#x27;s guilt, and loneliness often cause problems for the Tanners, as well as their fear of what could happen if others were to discover his existence, they grow to care for and love him as a part of the family.

Later it is revealed that ALF&#x27;s home planet, Melmac, exploded due to nuclear war, leaving him and other survivors of his species without a home, and that he survived its destruction because he was away as part of the Melmac Orbit Guard. In the season one episode &quot;Pennsylvania 6-5000&quot;, ALF tries to convince the President of the United States to stop the nuclear program, as he fears that Earth could suffer a similar fate to Melmac, though a misunderstanding causes the President and national security to call the FBI to arrest Willie. 

Episodes dealt with ALF learning about Earth and making new friends both in and out of the Tanner family including Willie&#x27;s brother Neal (Jim J. Bullock), Kate&#x27;s widowed mother Dorothy (Anne Meara), with whom ALF has a love-hate relationship, her boyfriend and later husband Whizzer (Paul Dooley), the Ochmoneks&#x27; nephew Jake (Josh Blake), the psychologist Larry (Bill Daily) and the blind woman Jody (Andrea Covell), who never learns of ALF&#x27;s true nature, but does know through touch that he is short and hairy.

Changes occur in the Tanner household over the course of the series, including the birth of a new child, Eric, who was added to the series because Anne Schedeen was pregnant at the time; ALF moving from the laundry room to the attic, which he and Willie convert into an &quot;apartment&quot;, and the death of Lucky in the season four episode &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, which ALF accepts despite having previously attempted to catch and eat him due to having come to love and respect him. When ALF adopts a new cat with the intention of eating it, he grows fond of it and allows the Tanners to adopt it. In the 1996 movie &quot;Project ALF&quot;, which follows ALF after his capture by the USAF, the Tanners do not appear due to moving to Iceland.

==Episodes==

* Uncle Albert (portrayed by Elisha Cook Jr.) is Willie&#x27;s uncle and Lynn and Brian&#x27;s great-uncle, who appeared in &quot;We&#x27;re So Sorry, Uncle Albert&quot; (Season 2). He later dies of shock after discovering ALF in a tent in the backyard.
* Rhonda (performed by Lisa Buckley), Skipper (performed by Bob Fappiano), Rick (performed by Fusco), and Stella (performed by Buckley) are four Melmacians who appeared in &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;(Season 1) during ALF&#x27;s flashback.

==Production==
Producer Bernie Brillstein was approached to see Fusco&#x27;s audition with a puppet character but was initially uninterested, having managed Jim Henson for years and regarding Henson as the best puppeteer in showbiz. However, Fusco&#x27;s brief performance as ALF won over Brillstein, who thought the character was hilarious and strong enough to be the focus of a series.

Fusco co-produced the series with Tom Patchett. Patchett also co-created, wrote, and directed the series. The series was first syndicated by Warner Bros. Television and Lorimar-Telepictures. The U.S. syndication rights were passed over to Debmar-Mercury when its parent company, Lionsgate, owned home video rights. Shout! Factory assumed distribution rights to the series in February 2022. 

Due to the inherent nature of producing a show featuring hand-operated puppets (&quot;à la&quot; Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;), &quot;ALF&quot; was technically difficult and extremely demanding on series creator Fusco as well as its four lead actors. All confirmed during a 2000 &quot;People&quot; magazine interview that there were constant high levels of tension on the set. Max Wright said that he despised supporting a technically demanding puppet that received most of the good lines of dialogue. He admitted to being &quot;hugely eager to have &quot;ALF&quot; over with.&quot; Artie Lange, who later worked with Wright on &quot;The Norm Show&quot;, told of a time when Wright had become &quot;crazed&quot; and physically attacked ALF, causing producers to have to pull Wright off the puppet. Anne Schedeen said that on the last night of taping the final episode, &quot;there was one take and Max walked off the set, went to his dressing room, got his bags, went to his car and disappeared... There were no goodbyes.&quot; Schedeen herself said &quot;there was no joy on the set... it was a technical nightmare – extremely slow, hot and tedious... A 30-minute show took 20, 25 hours to shoot.&quot; While fond of her on-screen children, Schedeen said some adults had &quot;difficult personalities. The whole thing was a big dysfunctional family.&quot; Schedeen added, &quot;It&#x27;s astonishing that &quot;ALF&quot; really was wonderful and that word never got out what a mess our set really was.&quot; Andrea Elson, who suffered from bulimia during the second season of shooting, said, &quot;If &quot;ALF&quot; had gone one more year, everybody would have lost it.&quot; Wright later admitted that as the years passed he looked back at &quot;ALF&quot; with less animosity and conceded that &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what I felt or what the days were like, &quot;ALF&quot; brought people a lot of joy.&quot; In reference to the tension, Fusco commented in 2012, &quot;It was just the nature of the beast. There was no way we could have made it go any further or any faster,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I think it was frustrating that it would take so long, but people got paid for what they did. Despite what people thought, that there was a lot of tension on set, there really wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

Fusco was notoriously secretive about his character up until the series&#x27; premiere. During the show&#x27;s production, Fusco refused to acknowledge that the puppet ALF was anything other than an alien. All involved with the production were cautioned not to reveal any of ALF&#x27;s production secrets.

The set was built on a platform raised four feet above the ground, with trap doors constructed at many points so that ALF could appear almost anywhere; Fusco operated him from underneath, so the unoccupied holes all over the floor were deep and treacherous. The trap doors had to be reset multiple times, sometimes during a single scene. Principal puppeteer Paul Fusco (who was mainly left-handed when puppeteering) used his left hand to control ALF&#x27;s mouth, while his right hand controlled ALF&#x27;s right arm. Another puppeteer, Lisa Buckley, who would go on to perform on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, assisted Fusco beneath the stage, operating ALF&#x27;s left arm. At times when ALF&#x27;s full body was shown in the sitting position, Lisa controlled ALF&#x27;s left hand by cable allowing slight finger movements. There was additionally a third puppeteer, Bob Fappiano, who controlled ALF&#x27;s facial and ear movements via a radio control offscreen. During tapings, Fusco would wear a head-mounted microphone to record ALF&#x27;s voice. The process resulted in numerous mistakes and retakes, making it impossible to record &quot;ALF&quot; in front of a live audience. A laugh track was added during post-production.

To avoid wear and tear on the principal ALF puppet, the performers rehearsed with a crude early version of ALF, nicknamed &quot;RALF&quot; for &quot;Rehearsal Alien Life Form&quot;). Fusco did not like to rehearse, and would often substitute his hand or RALF for the real ALF puppet during rehearsals. In an interview on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Tina Fey said that her biggest frustration as producer of NBC&#x27;s 75th-anniversary special was dealing with ALF&#x27;s &quot;people&quot;. Fey said Fusco would only allow ALF to appear on the show if the puppeteers were hidden from everyone else. After ALF&#x27;s cameo alongside former &quot;Family Ties&quot; star Michael Gross, ALF disappeared through a hole in the riser, was stuffed into a case, and immediately removed from the building.

While a puppet was usually used for ALF, there were some shots of the tiny alien running or walking around. This was accomplished by the actor Michu Meszaros wearing an ALF costume. This can be seen in one of the series&#x27; intros, which concludes with the Tanner family getting their picture taken; ALF (played by Meszaros) walks over to be part of the photo. However, Meszaros&#x27; services became too costly as well as time-consuming, and the full ALF costume was abandoned after the first season.

&quot;ALF&quot; scored its highest ratings during Season 2 (reaching tenth place in the Nielsen ratings). Ratings remained at a steady fifteenth place during Season 3, but plummeted to 39th place during Season 4. NBC moved the show from its traditional Monday night slot to Saturday in March 1990 and eventually moved to Sunday, but ratings continued to fall.

The season-ending cliffhanger &quot;Consider Me Gone&quot; became an unintentional series finale when NBC gave Alien Productions a verbal commitment for a fifth season, but ultimately withdrew its support. ABC resolved the cliffhanger on February 17, 1996, with the TV movie &quot;Project: ALF&quot;. NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff later told Fusco that the network regretted cancelling &quot;ALF&quot; prematurely, saying &quot;It was a big mistake that we cancelled your show, because you guys had at least one or two more seasons left.&quot;

===Censorship===
Fusco commented in 2007 that his most enjoyable experience on &quot;ALF&quot; was sitting in the Writers&#x27; Room and pitching jokes while pushing the limit as to what NBC censors would allow. Fusco commented that, &quot;the greatest things were the jokes we &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot; put in the show.&quot; Specifically, puns dealing with ALF eating cats and other pets were problematic after NBC reported that a child placed a cat in a microwave and killed it after watching the show. In the pilot episode &quot;A.L.F.&quot;, ALF is seen consuming a beer with Brian. Fusco defended the premise saying that &quot;ALF is 285 years old, he can drink beer, he&#x27;s old enough.&quot;(although in the &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; ALF gives his age as 227, and the writing in later episodes confirms this.) However, as &quot;ALF&quot; became more popular with children, NBC told Fusco &quot;you can&#x27;t have him drinking; the kids are watching, it&#x27;s a bad role model.&quot; Even though Fusco believed that ALF was &quot;an adult: he can do it&quot;, the alcohol consumption concept was discarded by the end of the first season, with the exception of the episode &quot;Tequila&quot; where he inspires an alcoholic to check into rehab after a night of drinking with her and making her think he was a hallucination. The cat-eating concept carried sporadically into the second season, with references including the &quot;wedding cat&quot; in the episode &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;, the Melmacian equivalent of a wedding cake.

For the hour-long season 1 episode, &quot;Try to Remember&quot;, originally broadcast on February 9, 1987, ALF tries to simulate a jacuzzi by bringing Kate&#x27;s electric mixer into the bathtub, thus receiving an electrical shock that caused amnesia. Fusco ended the original episode with a public service announcement from ALF himself, warning of the dangers of mixing water and electricity. Despite this, NBC reported that a child attempted to recreate the scenario and nearly electrocuted himself in the process (Fusco confirmed that the child was unharmed); Fusco was forced to refilm the opening sequence, replacing the electric mixer with a manual egg beater. ALF&#x27;s amnesia is instead caused by a cranial concussion received after slipping in the shower (a scream and &quot;thud&quot; is heard rather than a &quot;zap&quot;), with all mentions of being shocked either overdubbed with new dialogue or deleted entirely (including ALF&#x27;s public service announcement). This edited version was used for a Fall 1988 rebroadcast, as well as all future U.S. and Canadian syndicated airings.

In 2010, blooper footage surfaced in which ALF was made to deliver racial jokes and sexual comments. He was actually mocking a then-recent episode of &quot;L.A. Law&quot; dealing with Tourette syndrome. Asked to comment, producer Steve Lamar stated that the footage was from an era when things were not so &quot;ridiculously PC&quot;.

==International broadcast history==
In France, &quot;ALF&quot; aired on Antenne 2 in 1988.

&quot;ALF&quot; was popular in West Germany after it began airing on ZDF. The actor who dubbed ALF&#x27;s voice in German, Tommi Piper, recorded two albums and four singles as ALF between 1988 and 1991. In Italy, &quot;ALF&quot; aired on Rai 2 in 1988. In New Zealand, the entire series (and the movie) were screened on TVNZ. In the United Kingdom it was broadcast on CITV.

In the Philippines, the show aired on GMA Network with a simulcast on ABS-CBN and RPN-9 from 1986 to 1990. It moved to ABC-5, where it aired while dubbed in Tagalog from 1999 to 2002. In Guatemala, the show started to be aired in 1988 on Canal 3 as part of its night schedule the show was aired from 1988 to 1997 and briefly from 1999 to 2001 on Trecevisión as part of the afternoon schedule. During the initial airing from 1988 to 1994, the series was highly praised and earned a respectable rating amongst the TV viewers. In fact, Guatemala was the first country of Central America to air the show.

==Home media==

===United States and Canada===

==== Lionsgate syndicated DVD release ====
Between 2004 and 2006, Lionsgate Home Entertainment (under license from Paul Fusco and Brillstein/Grey Communications) released all four seasons of &quot;ALF&quot; on DVD in Region 1. All releases contained syndicated versions, with running times of 21 minutes, compared to the original length of 24 minutes. Episodes are arranged in production order, rather than broadcast order. However, the 60-minute episodes &quot;Try to Remember&quot; and &quot;ALF&#x27;s Special Christmas&quot; (from season one and season two, respectively), were presented in their original hour-long formats (though &quot;Try to Remember&quot; was presented in its censored version and &quot;ALF&#x27;s Special Christmas&quot; has a minor scene using the song &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town&quot; excised). The 60-minute episode &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, however, was split into two parts for syndication. The season four episode &quot;Make &#x27;Em Laugh&quot; was presented in nearly its original length, with a single line of dialogue edited out.

The &quot;To Be Continued...&quot; disclaimer was also removed from the series finale, &quot;Consider Me Gone&quot;, as NBC canceled &quot;ALF&quot; after its initial airing. In addition, most copyrighted music was excised from selected shows, shortening the running time by up to six minutes.

Lionsgate insisted that they had to utilize syndicated versions for the DVD release of &quot;ALF&quot;, saying it would be cost-prohibitive to remaster the original NBC-TV broadcast versions for release. This resulted in heavy criticism.

Video Service Corporation previously released two other DVDs of &quot;ALF&quot;. &quot;The ALF Files&quot; was released exclusively in Canada on November 1, 2002. The hour-long episodes &quot;Try to Remember&quot;, &quot;ALF&#x27;s Special Christmas&quot; and &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; were presented in their original hour-long format. &quot;Try to Remember&quot;, however, contains the re-edited version pertaining to ALF&#x27;s electric shock in the bathtub.

On September 13, 2005, &quot;Project: ALF&quot; was released. Both DVDs featured optional commentary by creator Paul Fusco, with co-creator Tom Patchett joining him on the first release.

==== Shout! Factory restored DVD release ====
On February 24, 2022, it was announced that Shout! Factory acquired the distribution rights to the series. Shout set up an &quot;ALFtv&quot; YouTube channel, posting several full episodes in their syndicated versions, and clips from others. On June 24, Shout presented the original uncut versions of fan-favorite episodes, with new commentary from Pratchett and Fusco (the latter in-character as ALF).

This was followed on October 17, 2023, by Shout&#x27;s released of a new DVD box set, containing &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;ALF: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;ALF Tales&quot;, and &quot;Project: ALF&quot;, all in their original restored broadcast versions, with the exception of the one-hour episodes &quot;Try to Remember&quot; and &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;.

Both episodes underwent restoration to their authentic durations and were not subjected to syndication-related truncation necessitated by time constraints. However, &quot;Try to Remember&quot; was sourced from the Fall 1988 rebroadcast censored version, wherein ALF&#x27;s electrical shock scene was substituted with his fall in the bathtub. &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; was presented in its two-part version rather than the original one-hour format.

In Canada, the first two seasons of &quot;ALF&quot; appear on Amazon Prime.

In the U.S., all four seasons of &quot;ALF&quot; appear on Peacock, as of June 11, 2023.

===Europe===
Warner Home Video, which is now Warner Brothers Discovery Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;ALF&quot; in Germany on September 4, 2009, and in the Netherlands and France on September 9. The DVDs are in PAL format, with English-language menus. The language selections available are English, French, German, and Spanish (except for season 2 which, despite being dubbed, oddly doesn&#x27;t feature Spanish, and the episode &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; which had not dubbed into German), with subtitles available in French, Dutch, Spanish, English, and German. The series was released on HBO Max on April 26, 2022, in Spain and July 12, 2022 in Nordics and Portugal.

The episodes span four discs and are uncut, unlike their American-edited counterparts, with a few exceptions:
* A scene from &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; where ALF and friend Jody are singing &quot;Ragtime Cowboy Joe&quot; and &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot; by Alvin and the Chipmunks was removed because of music copyright issues with Bagdasarian Productions, owners of the Chipmunks franchise.
* The censored version of &quot;Try to Remember&quot; was utilized, removing the mention of electrocution.
* The syndicated version of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rerun&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Ballad of Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;) was utilized, though the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; theme was retained.
* The series finale &quot;Consider Me Gone&quot; retained the &quot;To Be Continued...&quot; caption seen during its original March 1990 broadcast.

===Oceania===
In Region 4, Warner Home Video released the first two seasons of &quot;ALF&quot; on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on April 7, 2010. Seasons 3 and 4 have yet to get released in Region 4.

===Latin America===

On December 22, 2021, &quot;ALF&quot; was released on HBO Max in Latin America and Brazil, respectively.

==Awards==
In the U.S., &quot;ALF&quot; has won numerous awards. In 1987, the show won a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New TV Comedy Program; in 1988 it won Favorite Show at the Kids&#x27; Choice Awards; and at the 1989 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, ALF himself won Favorite TV Actor. Benji Gregory and Andrea Elson were also nominated in various Young Actor categories for their work on ALF at the Young Artist Awards during 1987–1989, with the show receiving a nomination for Best Family Television Series.

==Syndication==
Reruns of &quot;ALF&quot; entered off-network syndication in September 1990, an arrangement that later became less frequent on most local stations, until September 1995. Repeats of the show debuted on cable in 1999 on the Odyssey Network, remaining on the schedule after Hallmark took full control and airing until 2002. It also ran on Nick at Nite for a short time in 2001, and aired on the Hub Network from June 4, 2012, to October 12, 2014. It aired on MeTV from May 2017 until May 2020. Since January 2, 2023, the show has aired on Laff. It can be streamed on several streaming services, such as Peacock, Tubi, and Freevee.

==Spinoffs and related programming==

===Animated series===
To capitalize on the success of the series, a spin-off animated series was produced, airing Saturday mornings on NBC. &quot;ALF: The Animated Series&quot;, set on ALF&#x27;s home planet of Melmac, ran from 1987 to 1988 and was produced by DIC Entertainment. This was a prequel series, set on Melmac before the planet exploded. The show focused on ALF, his family, his friends, and his girlfriend Rhonda and their various exploits. Each episode was book-ended by a live-action sequence involving ALF talking to the television viewers, setting up the episode, and commenting on it afterward. When the cartoon entered its second season, it was paired in a one-hour block with its own spin-off &quot;ALF Tales&quot;, which took Gordon and the cast of characters from season one, and recast them as characters from assorted classic fairy tales.

Select episodes of both shows are included as special features on the &quot;ALF: Season 2&quot; DVD as well as the cartoon-specific releases &quot;ALF Animated Adventures – 20,000 Years in Driving School and Other Stories&quot; and &quot;ALF and The Beanstalk and Other Classic Fairy Tales&quot;.

The animated version of ALF also appeared in &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;.

===&quot;ALF&#x27;s Hit Talk Show&quot;===
In 2004, &quot;ALF&#x27;s Hit Talk Show&quot; debuted on U.S. cable channel TV Land, which featured ALF as a Johnny Carson-type TV talk-show host and co-starring Ed McMahon as his sidekick. Guests included Drew Carey, Tom Green, and Merv Griffin. It ran for seven episodes.

===Films===
After the end of the series, a made-for-television movie was produced, in 1996, intending to give the series a proper end. &quot;Project: ALF&quot; starts right after the series final episode but, especially because of the absence of the Tanners, it failed at obtaining success.

On May 21, 2012, Paul Fusco said he was pitching an &quot;ALF&quot; movie. In August 2012, it was reported that Sony Pictures Animation had acquired the rights to ALF and would develop the property into a CGI-live action hybrid feature. &quot;The Smurfs&quot; producer Jordan Kerner, would also produce the film, along with Tom Patchett and Paul Fusco. However, nothing further has since been announced.

===Cancelled reboot===
On August 1, 2018, Warner Bros. announced it would produce an &quot;ALF&quot; reboot. The reboot would have likely focused on ALF returning to Earth, with a new family and characters. In November 2018, Warner reported that it had canceled the reboot.

<doc id="245944" wikidata="Q5316114" url="?curid=245944" title="Durability (database systems)">
<text>In database systems, durability is the ACID property that guarantees that the effects of transactions that have been committed will survive permanently, even in cases of failures, including incidents and catastrophic events. For example, if a flight booking reports that a seat has successfully been booked, then the seat will remain booked even if the system crashes.

Formally, a database system ensures the durability property if it tolerates three types of failures: transaction, system, and media failures. In particular, a transaction fails if its execution is interrupted before all its operations have been processed by the system. These kinds of interruptions can be originated at the transaction level by data-entry errors, operator cancellation, timeout, or application-specific errors, like withdrawing money from a bank account with insufficient funds. At the system level, a failure occurs if the contents of the volatile storage are lost, due, for instance, to system crashes, like out-of-memory events. At the media level, where media means a stable storage that withstands system failures, failures happen when the stable storage, or part of it, is lost. These cases are typically represented by disk failures. 

Thus, to be durable, the database system should implement strategies and operations that guarantee that the effects of transactions that have been committed before the failure will survive the event (even by reconstruction), while the changes of incomplete transactions, which have not been committed yet at the time of failure, will be reverted and will not affect the state of the database system. These behaviours are proven to be correct when the execution of transactions has respectively the resilience and recoverability properties. 

==Mechanisms==

In transaction-based systems, the mechanisms that assure durability are historically associated with the concept of reliability of systems, as proposed by Jim Gray in 1981. This concept includes durability, but it also relies on aspects of the atomicity and consistency properties. Specifically, a reliability mechanism requires primitives that explicitly state the beginning, the end, and the rollback of transactions, which are also implied for the other two aforementioned properties. In this article, only the mechanisms strictly related to durability have been considered. These mechanisms are divided into three levels: transaction, system, and media level. This can be seen as well for scenarios where failures could happen and that have to be considered in the design of database systems to address durability. 

=== Transaction level ===
Durability against failures that occur at transaction level, such as canceled calls and inconsistent actions that may be blocked before committing by constraints and triggers, is guaranteed by the serializability property of the execution of transactions. The state generated by the effects of precedently committed transactions is available in main memory and, thus, is resilient, while the changes carried by non-committed transactions can be undone. In fact, thanks to serializability, they can be discerned from other transactions and, therefore, their changes are discarded. In addition, it is relevant to consider that in-place changes, which overwrite old values without keeping any kind of history are discouraged. There exist multiple approaches that keep track of the history of changes, such as timestamp-based solutions or logging and locking.

=== System level ===
At system level, failures happen, by definition, when the contents of the volatile storage are lost. This can occur in events like system crashes or power outages. Existing database systems use volatile storage (i.e. the main memory of the system) for different purposes: some store their whole state and data in it, even without any durability guarantee; others keep the state and the data, or part of them, in memory, but also use the non-volatile storage for data; other systems only keep the state in main memory, while keeping all the data on disk. The reason behind the choice of having volatile storage, which is subject to this type of failure, and non-volatile storage, is found in the performance differences of the existing technologies that are used to implement these kinds of storage. However, the situation is likely to evolve as the popularity of non-volatile memories (NVM) technologies grows.

In systems that include non-volatile storage, durability can be achieved by keeping and flushing an immutable sequential log of the transactions to such non-volatile storage before acknowledging commitment. Thanks to their atomicity property, the transactions can be considered the unit of work in the recovery process that guarantees durability while exploiting the log. In particular, the logging mechanism is called write-ahead log (WAL) and allows durability by buffering changes to the disk before they are synchronized from the main memory. In this way, by reconstruction from the log file, all committed transactions are resilient to system-level failures, because they can be redone. Non-committed transactions, instead, are recoverable, since their operations are logged to non-volatile storage before they effectively modify the state of the database. In this way, the partially executed operations can be undone without affecting the state of the system. After that, those transactions that were incomplete can be redone. Therefore, the transaction log from non-volatile storage can be reprocessed to recreate the system state right before any later system-level failure. Logging is done as a combination of tracking data and operations (i.e. transactions) for performance reasons.

=== Media level ===
At media level, failure scenarios affect non-volatile storage, like hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and other types of storage hardware components. To guarantee durability at this level, the database system shall rely on stable memory, which is a memory that is completely and ideally failure-resistant. This kind of memory can be achieved with mechanisms of replication and robust writing protocols. 

Many tools and technologies are available to provide a logical stable memory, such as the mirroring of disks, and their choice depends on the requirements of the specific applications. In general, replication and redundancy strategies and architectures that behave like stable memory are available at different levels of the technology stack. In this way, even in case of catastrophic events where the storage hardware is damaged, data loss can be prevented. At this level, there is a strong bond between durability and system and data recovery, in the sense that the main goal is to preserve the data, not necessarily in online replicas, but also as offline copies. These last techniques fall into the categories of backup, data loss prevention, and IT disaster recovery. 

Therefore, in case of media failure, the durability of transactions is guaranteed by the ability to reconstruct the state of the database from the log files stored in the stable memory, in any way it was implemented in the database system. There exist several mechanisms to store and reconstruct the state of a database system that improves the performance, both in terms of space and time, compared to managing all the log files created from the beginning of the database system. These mechanisms often include incremental dumping, differential files, and checkpoints.

===Distributed databases===
In distributed transactions, ensuring durability requires additional mechanisms to preserve a consistent state sequence across all database nodes. This means, for example, that a single node may not be enough to decide to conclude a transaction by committing it. In fact, the resources used in that transaction may be on other nodes, where other transactions are occurring concurrently. Otherwise, in case of failure, if consistency could not be guaranteed, it would be impossible to acknowledge a safe state of the database for recovery. For this reason, all participating nodes must coordinate before a commit can be acknowledged. This is usually done by a two-phase commit protocol.

In addition, in distributed databases, even the protocols for logging and recovery shall address the issues of distributed environments, such as deadlocks, that could prevent the resilience and recoverability of transactions and, thus, durability. A widely adopted family of algorithms that ensures these properties is Algorithms for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics (ARIES).

<text>Cattaraugus Reservation is an Indian reservation of the federally recognized Seneca Nation of Indians, formerly part of the Iroquois Confederacy located in New York. As of the 2000 census, the Indian reservation had a total population of 2,412. Its total area is about 34.4 mi² (89.1 km²). The reservation stretches from Lake Erie inward along Cattaraugus Creek, along either side of NY 438. It is divided among three counties for census purposes:

* Cattaraugus Reservation, Cattaraugus County
* Cattaraugus Reservation, Chautauqua County
* Cattaraugus Reservation, Erie County.
==Background and location==

A small cluster of Seneca-owned businesses are located along US 20 and NY 5 where they cross through the reservation. Facilities include numerous cannabis dispensaries, a Bingo Hall, with a Poker Room and various video slot machines. Interstate 90 passes through the reservation; the closest exit is located in Irving, New York.

In Erie County, the reservation is bordered by the Towns of Brant, North Collins, and Collins; in Cattaraugus County by the Town of Perrysburg; and in Chautauqua County by the Town of Hanover. (At the reservation&#x27;s southeast corner, near the village of Gowanda, it comes within a few feet of bordering the Town of Persia in Cattaraugus County.)

The reservation is mostly of a rural character, with one-family homes along Route 438 interspersed with businesses such as tobacco shops. The reservation is divided into several communities such as Newtown, Bucktown, Pinewoods, Eleven Acres, Ozarks, and Indian Hill. At the center of the reservation along Route 438 are the Seneca Nation government offices, a Head Start/Daycare Center, community buildings, and the volunteer fire department.

<doc id="245948" wikidata="Q7820753" url="?curid=245948" title="Tonawanda Reservation">
<text>The Tonawanda Indian Reservation () is an Indian reservation of the Tonawanda Seneca Nation located in western New York, United States. The band is a federally recognized tribe and, in the 2010 census, had 693 people living on the reservation. The reservation lies mostly in Genesee County, extending into Erie and Niagara counties. It is bordered by the Towns of Alabama, Pembroke, Newstead, and Royalton.

The Tonawanda Reservation is also known as the Tonawanda Creek Reservation. Currently, it has more than a half dozen businesses located on Bloomingdale Road within the reservation. Several sell untaxed, low-price cigarettes and gasoline. Other businesses sell Seneca craft goods, groceries, and prepared food.

== History ==
After various cultures of indigenous peoples succeeded each other in the Great Lakes area, in late prehistoric times, the five nations of the Iroquois coalesced. Before the mid-14th century, they had formed the Iroquois Confederacy. The Seneca were one of the Five Nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;. The current location of the Tonawanda Reservation is believed to be close to the likely poorly-defined border between the historic Seneca homeland and its rivals, the Neutral Nation that occupied the Niagara Region at the time of French missionary Joseph de La Roche Daillon&#x27;s arrival in the area in 1627.

The Iroquois pledged allegiance to the British Crown in the Nanfan Treaty. During the French and Indian War, the Iroquois and British defeated New France; the Iroquois and other native territory was placed in a massive Indian Reserve. During the American Revolutionary War, most of the Iroquois sided with the British Crown, as they hoped to end colonial encroachment; to this effect, the Iroquois led several massacres on colonial settlements, which provoked the Continental Army to respond with the scorched-earth Sullivan Expedition, wiping out much of the Senecas&#x27; already destitute homelands. After the Crown&#x27;s defeat, some of the Seneca, along with other Iroquois, migrated with Joseph Brant to the Grand River reservation in the still British-controlled territory of upper Canada (now known as the province of Ontario).

Those majority of the Seneca People remained in what is now western New York, subsequently were forced to ceding lands through the Canandaigua Treaty of 1794 and the Treaty of Big Tree in 1797 which led to the reservations in western New York, which are only a fraction of their original reservation . Most Reservation land after the Treaty were often violated by the state and today the boundaries have been reduced after illegal sales to White settlers and also the construction of the dam in Allegheny reservation which led to most arable land being swallowed by the Dam. Most of these were done without the permission of the Tribe.

In 1848, the Seneca Nation of Indians was formed to represent the Seneca as a federally recognized tribe. Due to a dispute over one of the Treaties of Buffalo Creek, where as the Senaca Indians wanted a republican form of government and the Tonawanda wanted a Traditional form of Government , the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians was formed in 1857 to represent the Tonawanda territory. In contrast to the Seneca Nation of Indians, which uses an American-style republican form of government, the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians preserves the traditional Seneca practices, including selection of life chiefs by heritage.

The Seneca of this reservation worked with self-taught anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan in mid century to teach him about the Iroquois kinship and social structures. He published the results of his work in 1851 as &quot;The League of the Ho-de-no-sau-nee or Iroquois.&quot; His insights about the significance and details of kinship structure in Native American societies influenced much following anthropological and ethnological research. Much of the information was provided by his colleague and friend Ely S. Parker, a Seneca born on the reservation in 1828. Morgan dedicated his book to Parker and credited him with their joint research.

Over the years, the size of the reservation had been reduced by forced sales of land by the state of New York to surrounding communities. The reservation is also noticeably more racially integrated than most Seneca Nation of Indians territories (excluding Salamanca, which operates on a lease system); whereas the Seneca Nation has actively resisted non-native settlement of its territories because of the past policy whereby white settlement meant that the tribe lost that parcel of land to Non Natives without their permission who often used it for farming. Tonawanda Band has been somewhat more tolerant of allowing non-natives to live on its territory.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the part in Niagara County has a total area of 0.8 mi2 (2.1 km2) and none of the area is covered with water. The Census Bureau reports the part of the reservation in Genesee County has a total area of 9.3 mi2 (24.0 km2). 9.2 mi2 (23.8 km2) of it is land and 0.1 mi2 (0.2 km2) of it (0.76%) is water. The Census Bureau reports the part in Erie County has a total area of 1.8 mi2 (4.8 km2). None of the area is covered with water.

The Tonawanda Creek flows through the entire reservation to the Niagara River, separating the part in Niagara County from the parts in Erie and Genesee counties. The river constitutes a barrier. Together with the absence of paved roads, these factors limit the population in this part of the reservation.

The northern boundary of the reservation&#x27;s Niagara County portion is part of the Tonawanda Wildlife Management Area.

==Demographics==

The United States Census Bureau compiles separate demographic data for each county&#x27;s portion of the reservation.

===Erie County===

As of the census of 2010, there were 34 people, 9 households, and 7 families living in the Indian reservation. The population density was 18.4 people per square mile (11.4/km2). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 2.7/mi2 (1.0/km2).

There were 9 households, out of which three consisted of a married couple living together and two were made of a single individual. One household had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.78 and the average family size was 4.43.

In the Indian reservation the population was spread out, with eighteen person under the age of 20, four people from 20 to 24, nine people from 25 to 44, one person from 45 to 64, and three persons 65 years of age or older. The median age was 19.5 years. Nineteen of the reservation&#x27;s residents were female and fifteen were male.

The median income for a household in the Indian reservation was $21,250. The per capita income for the Indian reservation is $20,950. None of the population were below the poverty line. Median incomes per family were not reported. &lt;-Figures specific to the Tonawanda Reservation is not included in the 2000 or 2010 census data. What was the source? 

===Genesee County===

The average household size was 2.87 and the average family size was 3.49.

In the Indian reservation the population was spread out, with 29.8% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 18 to 24, 26.3% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 12.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.2 males.

The median income for a household in the Indian reservation was $25,208, and the median income for a family was $36,563. Males had a median income of $31,250 versus $12,159 for females. The per capita income for the Indian reservation was $12,201. About 12.3% of families and 16.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.5% of those under age 18 and 16.1% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Oil Springs Reservation or Oil Spring Reservation is an Indian reservation of the federally recognized Seneca Nation that is located in southwestern New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the Indian reservation had one resident; in 2005 no tribal members had lived on the property. The reservation covers about , divided between the present-day counties of Allegany and Cattaraugus. The reservation is northwest of the village of Cuba. It is bordered by the Town of Cuba and the Town of Ischua.

The Seneca and earlier indigenous peoples had learned to use the petroleum-tainted water of the spring at this site for medicinal purposes. French Jesuit missionaries learned about its properties from the Seneca and recorded the spring as early as the 17th century. Today the Seneca operate two tax-free gas stations on this reservation to generate revenue for their people&#x27;s welfare.

== History ==
When the French Jesuit missionary Joseph de La Roche Daillon reached this area in 1627, the Oil Springs were held by the now defunct Wenro, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe. The Wenro abandoned the area in 1639, hoping to retrench with their allies the Huron further northwest, as their eastern neighbors, the Seneca of the Iroquois Confederacy, were attacking these tribes and rapidly conquering territory in order to expand their hunting grounds for the fur trade. The Seneca, Mohawk, and other three nations of the Iroquois Confederacy were trying to dominate the lucrative fur trade with the French in this area.

During the 18th century, the Seneca sided with the British Crown in most wars, including the American Revolutionary War. Seneca warriors were part of allied British-Iroquois raids against rebel colonial settlements in the Mohawk and Schoharie valleys; these attacks were led chiefly by Mohawk warriors under Joseph Brant. In retaliation, the Sullivan Expedition organized by American rebels swept through Iroquois country in western New York, destroying more than 40 Seneca villages, and their associated crops and winter stores. The surviving people fled to Canada, and many starved that winter.

After the Crown&#x27;s defeat, Britain ceded control of its territory in the lower colonies to the new United States, including the lands controlled by the Iroquois nations. In addition, due to the ferocity of the war in New York, most residents wanted the Indians expelled even though two nations had supported the rebels. The Seneca and other Iroquois nations were forced to cede most of their lands to the US. In the Treaty of Canandaigua, the Seneca negotiated the right to keep five plots: the territory around Oil Springs and the Allegheny River, the land surrounding Cattaraugus Creek, the former Neutral lands around Buffalo Creek, and their primary site of what is now known as the Tonawanda Reservation.

Seneca diplomat Cornplanter, who had aided in negotiations with the United States representatives, was later granted an additional 1500-acre plot in Pennsylvania by that state legislature as personal property for him and his descendants. Mary Jemison, a European-American woman who had been taken captive and assimilated into the Seneca tribe, was also granted land but sold her plot a few years later and established Jemison Town on the Allegany Reservation. Many Seneca moved to Canada, settling with other Iroquois at the Six Nations Grand River Reserve in what is now Ontario.

During the federal Indian Removal period of the 1830s, the Ogden Land Company conspired to buy all of the remaining Seneca lands in New York. They bribed, intimidated, and deceived a number of the Seneca chiefs to sign the Treaty of Buffalo Creek to that effect. In the end, Ogden purchased only the Buffalo Creek Reservation and left intact Oil Springs (along with the Allegany and Cattaraugus reservations).

In 1848 the Seneca Nation of Indians formed as a federally recognized tribe, counting the Oil Springs Reservation as one of its three territories (along with the Allegany and Cattaraugus reservations). Oil Springs is the only one of the three Seneca territories without a recognized capital or any jurisdictional representation in Seneca government.

In the 1850s, the Seneca began a case to evict squatters (including Stanley Clark, Philonus Pattison, Benjamin Chamberlain, William Gallagher, and future New York governor Horatio Seymour) from the Oil Springs Reservation, in order to restore control and use to the tribe. Clark and others had surveyed the land and allotted portions to influential men, including Seymour.

Thanks to the efforts of influential Seneca leader Governor Blacksnake, the state appeals court ruled in the tribe&#x27;s favor. The reservation was returned to the Seneca in 1861, two years after Blacksnake died. Blacksnake, who had attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree, testified in court that he and Joseph Ellicott had surveyed the Oil Spring lands and that omission of the lands from the treaty was a mistake. He had a map copied by the Holland Land Company in which the Oil Spring reservation was marked similarly to the other lands of the Seneca.

The U.S. Census of 1890 lists the name of the reservation as Oil Spring Reservation. It is unclear when the reservation&#x27;s name was changed to Oil Springs; the change may have happened because people used a term that flowed more easily as language. A change shortly after the 1890 census would be consistent with the establishment of the United States Board on Geographic Names that same year, which altered and standardized several place names.

The Seneca have operated a bingo and gaming hall at Oil Springs since 2014.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Allegany County portion of the Indian reservation has a total area of . Most of it is land while 1.64% is water, most of which is a portion of Cuba Lake.

The Cattaraugus County portion of the Indian reservation, in the Town of Ischua, has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there are no residents in the Town of Ischua area of the reservation. The single resident on the reservation is Native American and lives in the Allegany County portion of the property.

<text>Artificial Intelligence for Environment &amp; Sustainability (ARIES) is an international non-profit research project hosted by the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3) headquartered in Bilbao, Spain. It was created to integrate scientific computational models for environmental sustainability assessment and policy-making, through ecoinformatics.

==Technology and applications==
ARIES seeks to integrate scientific data and models that simulate environmental and socioeconomic systems to address linked scientific modelling problems, through semantics (computer science), FAIR data and models, and an open-source software infrastructure called Knowledge Laboratory (k.LAB) to semantically describe, code, and distribute data and models for end-users, modellers, and network administrators.

ARIES currently includes two web-based applications: the k.Explorer and the ARIES for SEEA Explorer. Released in Fall 2018, k.Explorer is an interface that allows non-technical users to run sophisticated models. The ARIES for SEEA Explorer was released in April 2021 by BC3 in collaboration with the Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for rapid, standardized and customizable natural capital accounting. Shortly following the adoption of the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) Ecosystem Accounting standard by United Nations in March 2021, the ARIES for SEEA Explorer was made available on the UN Global Platform in order to accelerate SEEA&#x27;s implementation worldwide.

==History and partners==
The ARIES Project started in April 2007 at the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics of the University of Vermont, United States, sponsored by a $1M grant from the U.S. government&#x27;s National Science Foundation. A prototype of the model building system was developed over the following year, and a functional prototype was made available online in 2012. Since 2010, the project has been based at BC3, where the technology has continued developing ever since. Since 2013, the ARIES team has held the International Spring University (ISU) on Ecosystem Services Modelling, an annual intensive modelling school for scientists and policy analysts working in the environmental sustainability field.

ARIES is led from a global hub at BC3 in collaboration with Ca&#x27; Foscari University of Venice, the Global Change Research Centre, HydroloGIS Environmental Engineering, IHCantabria, the Institute of Materials and Systems for Sustainability of Nagoya University, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), UN DESA, the University of Udine, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

<text>In computer science, Algorithms for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics, or ARIES, is a recovery algorithm designed to work with a no-force, steal database approach; it is used by IBM Db2, Microsoft SQL Server and many other database systems. IBM Fellow Chandrasekaran Mohan is the primary inventor of the ARIES family of algorithms.

Three main principles lie behind ARIES:

* Write-ahead logging: Any change to an object is first recorded in the log, and the log must be written to stable storage before changes to the object are written to disk.
* Repeating history during Redo: On restart after a crash, ARIES retraces the actions of a database before the crash and brings the system back to the exact state that it was in before the crash. Then it undoes the transactions still active at crash time.
* Logging changes during Undo: Changes made to the database while undoing transactions are logged to ensure such an action isn&#x27;t repeated in the event of repeated restarts.

== Logging ==

The ARIES algorithm relies on logging of all database operations with ascending Sequence Numbers. Usually the resulting logfile is stored on so-called &quot;stable storage&quot;, that is a storage medium that is assumed to survive crashes and hardware failures. 

To gather the necessary information for the logs, two data structures have to be maintained: the dirty page table (DPT) and the transaction table (TT).

The dirty page table keeps record of all the pages that have been modified, and not yet written to disk, and the first Sequence Number that caused that page to become dirty. The transaction table contains all currently running transactions and the Sequence Number of the last log entry they created.

We create log records of the form (Sequence Number, Transaction ID, Page ID, Redo, Undo, Previous Sequence Number). The Redo and Undo fields keep information about the changes this log record saves and how to undo them. The Previous Sequence Number is a reference to the previous log record that was created for this transaction. In the case of an aborted transaction, it&#x27;s possible to traverse the log file in reverse order using the Previous Sequence Numbers, undoing all actions taken within the specific transaction.

Every transaction implicitly begins with the first &quot;Update&quot; type of entry for the given Transaction ID, and is committed with &quot;End Of Log&quot; (EOL) entry for the transaction.

During a recovery, or while undoing the actions of an aborted transaction, a special kind of log record is written, the Compensation Log Record (CLR), to record that the action has already been undone. CLRs are of the form (Sequence Number, Transaction ID, Page ID, Redo, Previous Sequence Number, Next Undo Sequence Number). The Redo field contains application of Undo field of reverted action, and the Undo field is omitted because CLR is never reverted.

== Recovery ==

The recovery works in three phases. The first phase, Analysis, computes all the necessary information from the logfile. The Redo phase restores the database to the exact state at the crash, including all the changes of uncommitted transactions that were running at that point in time. The Undo phase then undoes all uncommitted changes, leaving the database in a consistent state.

=== Analysis ===

During the Analysis phase we restore the DPT and the TT as they were at the time of the crash.

We run through the logfile (from the beginning or the last checkpoint) and add all transactions for which we encounter Begin Transaction entries to the TT. Whenever an End Log entry is found, the corresponding transaction is removed. The last Sequence Number for each transaction is also maintained.

During the same run we also fill the dirty page table by adding a new entry whenever we encounter a page that is modified and not yet in the DPT. This however only computes a superset of all dirty pages at the time of the crash, since we don&#x27;t check the actual database file whether the page was written back to the storage.

=== Redo ===

From the DPT, we can compute the minimal Sequence Number of a dirty page. From there, we have to start redoing the actions until the crash, in case they weren&#x27;t persisted already.

Running through the log file, we check for each entry, whether the modified page P on the entry exists in the DPT. If it doesn&#x27;t, then we do not have to worry about redoing this entry since the data persists on the disk. If page P exists in the DPT table, then we see whether the Sequence Number in the DPT is smaller than the Sequence Number of the log record (i.e. whether the change in the log is newer than the last version that was persisted). If it isn&#x27;t, then we don&#x27;t redo the entry since the change is already there. If it is, we fetch the page from the database storage and check the Sequence Number stored on the page to the Sequence Number on the log record. If the former is smaller than the latter, the page needs to be written to the disk. That check is necessary because the recovered DPT is only a conservative superset of the pages that really need changes to be reapplied. Lastly, when all the above checks are finished and failed, we reapply the redo action and store the new Sequence Number on the page. It is also important for recovery from a crash during the Redo phase, as the redo isn&#x27;t applied twice to the same page.

=== Undo ===

After the Redo phase, the database reflects the exact state at the crash. However the changes of uncommitted transactions have to be undone to restore the database to a consistent state.

For that we run backwards through the log for each transaction in the TT (those runs can of course be combined into one) using the Previous Sequence Number fields in the records. For each record we undo the changes (using the information in the Undo field) and write a compensation log record to the log file. If we encounter a Begin Transaction record we write an End Log record for that transaction.

The compensation log records make it possible to recover during a crash that occurs during the recovery phase. That isn&#x27;t as uncommon as one might think, as it is possible for the recovery phase to take quite long. CLRs are read during the Analysis phase and redone during the Redo phase.

== Checkpoints ==

To avoid re-scanning the whole logfile during the analysis phase it is advisable to save the DPT and the TT regularly to the logfile, forming a checkpoint. Instead of having to run through the whole file it is just necessary to run backwards until a checkpoint is found. From that point it is possible to restore the DPT and the TT as they were at the time of the crash by reading the logfile forward again. Then it is possible to proceed as usual with Redo and Undo.

The naive way for checkpointing involves locking the whole database to avoid changes to the DPT and the TT during the creation of the checkpoint. Fuzzy logging circumvents that by writing two log records. One Fuzzy Log Starts Here record and, after preparing the checkpoint data, the actual checkpoint. Between the two records other log records can be created. During recovery it is necessary to find both records to obtain a valid checkpoint.

<text>Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is the parallel or simultaneous execution of a sequence of instructions in a computer program. More specifically, ILP refers to the average number of instructions run per step of this parallel execution.

== Discussion ==

ILP must not be confused with concurrency. In ILP, there is a single specific thread of execution of a process. On the other hand, concurrency involves the assignment of multiple threads to a CPU&#x27;s core in a strict alternation, or in true parallelism if there are enough CPU cores, ideally one core for each runnable thread. 

There are two approaches to instruction-level parallelism: hardware and software. 

Hardware-level ILP works upon dynamic parallelism, whereas software-level ILP works on static parallelism. Dynamic parallelism means that the processor decides at run time which instructions to execute in parallel, whereas static parallelism means the compiler decides which instructions to execute in parallel. The Pentium processor and later x86 processors work on the dynamic sequence of parallel execution, but the Itanium processor works on the static level parallelism.

Consider the following program:

e = a + b
f = c + d
m = e * f

Operation 3 depends on the results of operations 1 and 2, so it cannot be calculated until both of them are completed. However, operations 1 and 2 do not depend on any other operation, so they can be calculated simultaneously. If we assume that each operation can be completed in one unit of time, then these three instructions can be completed in a total of two units of time, giving an ILP of 3/2.

A goal of compiler and processor designers is to identify and take advantage of as much ILP as possible. Ordinary programs are typically written under a sequential execution model where instructions execute one after the other and in the order specified by the programmer. ILP allows the compiler and the processor to overlap the execution of multiple instructions or even to change the order in which instructions are executed.

How much ILP exists in programs is very application-specific. In certain fields, such as graphics and scientific computing, the amount can be very large. However, workloads such as cryptography may exhibit much less parallelism.

Micro-architectural techniques that are used to exploit ILP include:
*Instruction pipelining, where the execution of multiple instructions can be partially overlapped.
*Superscalar execution, VLIW, and the closely related explicitly parallel instruction computing concepts, in which multiple execution units are used to execute multiple instructions in parallel.
*Out-of-order execution where instructions execute in any order that does not violate data dependencies. Note that this technique is independent of both pipelining and superscalar execution. Current implementations of out-of-order execution dynamically (i.e., while the program is executing and without any help from the compiler) extract ILP from ordinary programs. An alternative is to extract this parallelism at compile time and somehow convey this information to the hardware. Due to the complexity of scaling the out-of-order execution technique, the industry has re-examined instruction sets which explicitly encode multiple independent operations per instruction.
*Register renaming, which refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialization of program operations imposed by the reuse of registers by those operations, used to enable out-of-order execution.
*Speculative execution, which allows the execution of complete instructions or parts of instructions before being certain whether this execution should take place. A commonly used form of speculative execution is control flow speculation, where instructions past a control flow instruction (e.g., a branch) are executed before the target of the control flow instruction is determined. Several other forms of speculative execution have been proposed and are in use, including speculative execution driven by value prediction, memory dependence prediction, and cache latency prediction.
*Branch prediction, which is used to avoid stalling for control dependencies to be resolved. Branch prediction is used with speculative execution.

ILP is exploited by both the compiler and hardware, but the compiler also provides inherent and implicit ILP in programs to hardware by compile-time optimizations. Some optimization techniques for extracting available ILP in programs include instruction scheduling, register allocation/renaming, and memory-access optimization. 

Dataflow architectures are another class of architectures where ILP is explicitly specified; for a recent example, see the TRIPS architecture.

In recent years, ILP techniques have been used to provide performance improvements in spite of the growing disparity between processor operating frequencies and memory access times (early ILP designs such as the IBM System/360 Model 91 used ILP techniques to overcome the limitations imposed by a relatively small register file). Presently, a cache miss penalty to main memory costs several hundreds of CPU cycles. While in principle it is possible to use ILP to tolerate even such memory latencies, the associated resource and power dissipation costs are disproportionate. Moreover, the complexity and often the latency of the underlying hardware structures results in reduced operating frequency, further reducing any benefits. Hence, the aforementioned techniques prove inadequate to keep the CPU from stalling for the off-chip data. Instead, the industry is heading towards exploiting higher levels of parallelism that can be exploited through techniques such as multiprocessing and multithreading.

<text>Distributed generation, also distributed energy, on-site generation (OSG), or district/decentralized energy, is electrical generation and storage performed by a variety of small, grid-connected or distribution system-connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources (DER).

Conventional power stations, such as coal-fired, gas, and nuclear powered plants, as well as hydroelectric dams and large-scale solar power stations, are centralized and often require electric energy to be transmitted over long distances. By contrast, DER systems are decentralized, modular, and more flexible technologies that are located close to the load they serve, albeit having capacities of only 10 megawatts (MW) or less. These systems can comprise multiple generation and storage components; in this instance, they are referred to as hybrid power systems.

DER systems typically use renewable energy sources, including small hydro, biomass, biogas, solar power, wind power, and geothermal power, and increasingly play an important role for the electric power distribution system. A grid-connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a DER system and is often called a distributed energy storage system (DESS). By means of an interface, DER systems can be managed and coordinated within a smart grid. Distributed generation and storage enables the collection of energy from many sources and may lower environmental impacts and improve the security of supply.

One of the major issues with the integration of the DER such as solar power, wind power, etc. is the uncertain nature of such electricity resources. This uncertainty can cause a few problems in the distribution system: (i) it makes the supply-demand relationships extremely complex, and requires complicated optimization tools to balance the network, and (ii) it puts higher pressure on the transmission network, and (iii) it may cause reverse power flow from the distribution system to transmission system.

Microgrids are modern, localized, small-scale grids, contrary to the traditional, centralized electricity grid (macrogrid). Microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously, strengthen grid resilience, and help mitigate grid disturbances. They are typically low-voltage AC grids, often use diesel generators, and are installed by the community they serve. Microgrids increasingly employ a mixture of different distributed energy resources, such as solar hybrid power systems, which significantly reduce the amount of carbon emitted.

== Overview ==

Historically, central plants have been an integral part of the electric grid, in which large generating facilities are specifically located either close to resources or otherwise located far from populated load centers. These, in turn, supply the traditional transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) grid that distributes bulk power to load centers and from there to consumers. These were developed when the costs of transporting fuel and integrating generating technologies into populated areas far exceeded the cost of developing T&amp;D facilities and tariffs. Central plants are usually designed to take advantage of available economies of scale in a site-specific manner, and are built as &quot;one-off&quot;, custom projects.

These economies of scale began to fail in the late 1960s and, by the start of the 21st century, Central Plants could arguably no longer deliver competitively cheap and reliable electricity to more remote customers through the grid, because the plants had come to cost less than the grid and had become so reliable that nearly all power failures originated in the grid. Thus, the grid had become the main driver of remote customers&#x27; power costs and power quality problems, which became more acute as digital equipment required extremely reliable electricity. Efficiency gains no longer come from increasing generating capacity, but from smaller units located closer to sites of demand.

For example, coal power plants are built away from cities to prevent their heavy air pollution from affecting the populace. In addition, such plants are often built near collieries to minimize the cost of transporting coal. Hydroelectric plants are by their nature limited to operating at sites with sufficient water flow.

Low pollution is a crucial advantage of combined cycle plants that burn natural gas. The low pollution permits the plants to be near enough to a city to provide district heating and cooling.

Distributed energy resources are mass-produced, small, and less site-specific. Their development arose out of:
# concerns over perceived externalized costs of central plant generation, particularly environmental concerns;
# the increasing age, deterioration, and capacity constraints upon T&amp;D for bulk power;
# the increasing relative economy of mass production of smaller appliances over heavy manufacturing of larger units and on-site construction;
# Along with higher relative prices for energy, higher overall complexity and total costs for regulatory oversight, tariff administration, and metering and billing.

Capital markets have come to realize that right-sized resources, for individual customers, distribution substations, or microgrids, are able to offer important but little-known economic advantages over central plants. Smaller units achieved greater economic benefits through mass-production than larger units gained from their size alone. The increased value of these resources—resulting from improvements in financial risk, engineering flexibility, security, and environmental quality—often outweighs their apparent cost disadvantages. Distributed generation (DG), vis-à-vis central plants, must be justified on a life-cycle basis. Unfortunately, many of the direct, and virtually all of the indirect, benefits of DG are not captured within traditional utility cash-flow accounting.

While the levelized cost of DG is typically more expensive than conventional, centralized sources on a kilowatt-hour basis, this does not consider negative aspects of conventional fuels. The additional premium for DG is rapidly declining as demand increases and technology progresses, and sufficient and reliable demand may bring economies of scale, innovation, competition, and more flexible financing, that could make DG clean energy part of a more diversified future.

DG reduces the amount of energy lost in transmitting electricity because the electricity is generated very near where it is used, perhaps even in the same building. This also reduces the size and number of power lines that must be constructed.

Typical DER systems in a feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme have low maintenance, low pollution and high efficiencies. In the past, these traits required dedicated operating engineers and large complex plants to reduce pollution. However, modern embedded systems can provide these traits with automated operation and renewable energy, such as solar, wind and geothermal. This reduces the size of power plant that can show a profit.

=== Cybersecurity ===
Vulnerabilities in control systems from a single vendor used at thousands of installations of given source can result in hacking and remotely disabling all these sources by a single attacker, thus largely reversing the benefits of decentralised generation, which has been demonstrated in practice in case of solar power inverters and wind power control systems. In November 2024 Deye and Sol-Ark inverter manufacturer remotely disabled in some countries due to alleged regional sales policy dispute. The companies later claimed the blockage was not remote but due to geofencing mechanisms built into the inverters.

EU NIS2 directive expands the cybersecurity requirements to the energy generation market, which has faced backlash from renewable energy lobby groups.

=== Grid parity ===

Grid parity occurs when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost (LCOE) that is less than or equal to the end consumer&#x27;s retail price. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support. Since the 2010s, grid parity for solar and wind has become a reality in a growing number of markets, including Australia, several European countries, and some states in the U.S.

== Technologies ==

Distributed energy resource (DER) systems are small-scale power generation or storage technologies (typically in the range of 1 kW to 10,000 kW) used to provide an alternative to or an enhancement of the traditional electric power system. DER systems typically are characterized by high initial capital costs per kilowatt. DER systems also serve as storage device and are often called &quot;Distributed energy storage systems&quot; (DESS).

DER systems may include the following devices/technologies:
* Combined heat power (CHP), also known as &quot;cogeneration&quot; or &quot;trigeneration&quot;
* Fuel cells
* Hybrid power systems (solar hybrid and wind hybrid systems)
* Micro combined heat and power (MicroCHP)
* Microturbines
* Photovoltaic systems (typically rooftop solar PV)
* Reciprocating engines
* Small wind power systems
* Stirling engines
* or a combination of the above. For example, hybrid photovoltaic, CHP and battery systems can provide full electric power for single family residences without extreme storage expenses.

=== Cogeneration ===

Distributed cogeneration sources use steam turbines, natural gas-fired fuel cells, microturbines or reciprocating engines to turn generators. The hot exhaust is then used for space or water heating, or to drive an absorptive chiller for cooling such as air-conditioning. In addition to natural gas-based schemes, distributed energy projects can also include other renewable or low carbon fuels including biofuels, biogas, landfill gas, sewage gas, coal bed methane, syngas and associated petroleum gas.

Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales, the fuel cell micro combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012. 20.000 units were sold in Japan in 2012 overall within the Ene Farm project. With a Lifetime of around 60,000 hours for PEM fuel cell units, which shut down at night, this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years. For a price of $22,600 before installation. For 2013 a state subsidy for 50,000 units is in place.

In addition, molten carbonate fuel cell and solid oxide fuel cells using natural gas, such as the ones from FuelCell Energy and the Bloom energy server, or waste-to-energy processes such as the Gate 5 Energy System are used as a distributed energy resource.

=== Solar power ===
Photovoltaics, by far the most important solar technology for distributed generation of solar power, uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. It is a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years. PV systems range from distributed, residential, and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large, centralized utility-scale photovoltaic power stations.

The predominant PV technology is crystalline silicon, while thin-film solar cell technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment. In recent years, PV technology has improved its sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency, reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time (EPBT) and levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets in 2014.

As most renewable energy sources and unlike coal and nuclear, solar PV is variable and non-dispatchable, but has no fuel costs, operating pollution, as well as greatly reduced mining-safety and operating-safety issues. It produces peak power around local noon each day and its capacity factor is around 20 percent.

=== Wind power ===
Wind turbines can be distributed energy resources or they can be built at utility scale. These have low maintenance and low pollution, but distributed wind unlike utility-scale wind has much higher costs than other sources of energy. As with solar, wind energy is variable and non-dispatchable. Wind towers and generators have substantial insurable liabilities caused by high winds, but good operating safety. Distributed generation from wind hybrid power systems combines wind power with other DER systems. One such example is the integration of wind turbines into solar hybrid power systems, as wind tends to complement solar because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year.

=== Hydro power ===
Hydroelectricity is the most widely used form of renewable energy and its potential has already been explored to a large extent or is compromised due to issues such as environmental impacts on fisheries, and increased demand for recreational access. However, using modern 21st century technology, such as wave power, can make large amounts of new hydropower capacity available, with minor environmental impact.

Modular and scalable &quot;Next generation kinetic energy turbines&quot; can be deployed in arrays to serve the needs on a residential, commercial, industrial, municipal or even regional scale. &quot;Microhydro kinetic generators&quot; neither require dams nor impoundments, as they utilize the kinetic energy of water motion, either waves or flow. No construction is needed on the shoreline or sea bed, which minimizes environmental impacts to habitats and simplifies the permitting process. Such power generation also has minimal environmental impact and non-traditional microhydro applications can be tethered to existing construction such as docks, piers, bridge abutments, or similar structures.

=== Waste-to-energy ===
Municipal solid waste (MSW) and natural waste, such as sewage sludge, food waste and animal manure will decompose and discharge methane-containing gas that can be collected and used as fuel in gas turbines or micro turbines to produce electricity as a distributed energy resource. Additionally, a California-based company, Gate 5 Energy Partners, Inc. has developed a process that transforms natural waste materials, such as sewage sludge, into biofuel that can be combusted to power a steam turbine that produces power. This power can be used in lieu of grid-power at the waste source (such as a treatment plant, farm or dairy).

=== Energy storage ===
A distributed energy resource is not limited to the generation of electricity but may also include a device to store distributed energy (DE). Distributed energy storage systems (DESS) applications include several types of battery, pumped hydro, compressed air, and thermal energy storage. Access to energy storage for commercial applications is easily accessible through programs such as energy storage as a service (ESaaS).

==== PV storage ====
: Common rechargeable battery technologies used in today&#x27;s PV systems include, the valve regulated lead-acid battery (lead–acid battery), nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Compared to the other types, lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, due to their high reliability, low self-discharge (4–6% per year) as well as low investment and maintenance costs, they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, as storage devices for PV systems are stationary, the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries are not as critical as for electric vehicles.

: However, lithium-ion batteries, such as the Tesla Powerwall, have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as future storage devices, since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries that are considered for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.

==== Vehicle-to-grid ====

: Future generations of electric vehicles may have the ability to deliver power from the battery in a vehicle-to-grid into the grid when needed. An electric vehicle network has the potential to serve as a DESS.

==== Flywheels ====

: An advanced flywheel energy storage (FES) stores the electricity generated from distributed resources in the form of angular kinetic energy by accelerating a rotor (flywheel) to a very high speed of about 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm in a vacuum enclosure. Flywheels can respond quickly as they store and feed back electricity into the grid in a matter of seconds.

== Integration with the grid ==

For reasons of reliability, distributed generation resources would be interconnected to the same transmission grid as central stations. Various technical and economic issues occur in the integration of these resources into a grid. Technical problems arise in the areas of power quality, voltage stability, harmonics, reliability, protection, and control. Behavior of protective devices on the grid must be examined for all combinations of distributed and central station generation. A large scale deployment of distributed generation may affect grid-wide functions such as frequency control and allocation of reserves. As a result, smart grid functions, virtual power plants and grid energy storage such as power to gas stations are added to the grid. Conflicts occur between utilities and resource managing organizations.

Each distributed generation resource has its own integration issues. Solar PV and wind power both have intermittent and unpredictable generation, so they create many stability issues for voltage and frequency. These voltage issues affect mechanical grid equipment, such as load tap changers, which respond too often and wear out much more quickly than utilities anticipated. Also, without any form of energy storage during times of high solar generation, companies must rapidly increase generation around the time of sunset to compensate for the loss of solar generation. This high ramp rate produces what the industry terms the &quot;duck curve&quot; that is a major concern for grid operators in the future. Storage can fix these issues if it can be implemented. Flywheels have shown to provide excellent frequency regulation. Also, flywheels are highly cyclable compared to batteries, meaning they maintain the same energy and power after a significant amount of cycles( on the order of 10,000 cycles). Short term use batteries, at a large enough scale of use, can help to flatten the duck curve and prevent generator use fluctuation and can help to maintain voltage profile. However, cost is a major limiting factor for energy storage as each technique is prohibitively expensive to produce at scale and comparatively not energy dense compared to liquid fossil fuels. 
Finally, another method of aiding in integration is in the use of intelligent inverters that have the capability to also store the energy when there is more energy production than consumption.

== Mitigating voltage and frequency issues of DG integration ==
There have been some efforts to mitigate voltage and frequency issues due to increased implementation of DG. Most notably, IEEE 1547 sets the standard for interconnection and interoperability of distributed energy resources. IEEE 1547 sets specific curves signaling when to clear a fault as a function of the time after the disturbance and the magnitude of the voltage irregularity or frequency irregularity. Voltage issues also give legacy equipment the opportunity to perform new operations. Notably, inverters can regulate the voltage output of DGs. Changing inverter impedances can change voltage fluctuations of DG, meaning inverters have the ability to control DG voltage output. To reduce the effect of DG integration on mechanical grid equipment, transformers and load tap changers have the potential to implement specific tap operation vs. voltage operation curves mitigating the effect of voltage irregularities due to DG. That is, load tap changers respond to voltage fluctuations that last for a longer period than voltage fluctuations created from DG equipment.

== Stand alone hybrid systems ==
It is now possible to combine technologies such as photovoltaics, batteries and cogeneration to make stand alone distributed generation systems.

Recent work has shown that such systems have a low levelized cost of electricity.

Many authors now think that these technologies may enable a mass-scale grid defection because consumers can produce electricity using off grid systems primarily made up of solar photovoltaic technology. For example, the Rocky Mountain Institute has proposed that there may wide scale grid defection. This is backed up by studies in the Midwest.

== Cost factors ==

Cogenerators find favor because most buildings already burn fuels, and the cogeneration can extract more value from the fuel. Local production has no electricity transmission losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the Joule effect in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost (see also cost of electricity by source). Some larger installations utilize combined cycle generation. Usually this consists of a gas turbine whose exhaust boils water for a steam turbine in a Rankine cycle. The condenser of the steam cycle provides the heat for space heating or an absorptive chiller. Combined cycle plants with cogeneration have the highest known thermal efficiencies, often exceeding 85%. In countries with high pressure gas distribution, small turbines can be used to bring the gas pressure to domestic levels whilst extracting useful energy. If the UK were to implement this countrywide an additional 2-4 GWe would become available. (Note that the energy is already being generated elsewhere to provide the high initial gas pressure – this method simply distributes the energy via a different route.)

== Microgrid ==
A &quot;microgrid&quot; is a localized grouping of electricity generation, energy storage, and loads that normally operates connected to a traditional centralized grid (macrogrid). This single point of common coupling with the macrogrid can be disconnected. The microgrid can then function autonomously. Generation and loads in a microgrid are usually interconnected at low voltage and it can operate in DC, AC, or the combination of both. From the point of view of the grid operator, a connected microgrid can be controlled as if it were one entity.

Microgrid generation resources can include stationary batteries, fuel cells, solar, wind, or other energy sources. The multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power. Produced heat from generation sources such as microturbines could be used for local process heating or space heating, allowing flexible trade off between the needs for heat and electric power.

Micro-grids were proposed in the wake of the July 2012 India blackout:
* Small micro-grids covering 30–50 km radius
* Small power stations of 5–10 MW to serve the micro-grids
* Generate power locally to reduce dependence on long-distance transmission lines and cut transmission losses.

Micro-grids have seen implementation in a number of communities over the world. For example, Tesla has implemented a solar micro-grid in the Samoan island of Ta&#x27;u, powering the entire island with solar energy. This localized production system has helped save over of diesel fuel. It is also able to sustain the island for three whole days if the sun were not to shine at all during that period. This is a great example of how micro-grid systems can be implemented in communities to encourage renewable resource usage and localized production.

To plan and install Microgrids correctly, engineering modelling is needed. Multiple simulation tools and optimization tools exist to model the economic and electric effects of Microgrids. A widely used economic optimization tool is the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Another frequently used commercial economic modelling tool is Homer Energy, originally designed by the National Renewable Laboratory. There are also some power flow and electrical design tools guiding the Microgrid developers. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory designed the public available GridLAB-D tool and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) designed OpenDSS to simulate the distribution system (for Microgrids). A professional integrated DER-CAM and OpenDSS version is available via BankableEnergy . A European tool that can be used for electrical, cooling, heating, and process heat demand simulation is EnergyPLAN from the Aalborg University, Denmark.

== Communication in DER systems ==
* IEC 61850-7-420 is published by IEC TC 57: Power systems management and associated information exchange. It is one of the IEC 61850 standards, some of which are core Standards required for implementing smart grids. It uses communication services mapped to MMS as per IEC 61850-8-1 standard.
* OPC is also used for the communication between different entities of DER system.
* Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 2030.7 microgrid controller standard. That concept relies on 4 blocks: a) Device Level control (e.g. Voltage and Frequency Control), b) Local Area Control (e.g. data communication), c) Supervisory (software) controller (e.g. forward looking dispatch optimization of generation and load resources), and d) Grid Layer (e.g. communication with utility).
* A wide variety of complex control algorithms exist, making it difficult for small and residential Distributed Energy Resource (DER) users to implement energy management and control systems. Especially, communication upgrades and data information systems can make it expensive. Thus, some projects try to simplify the control of DER via off-the shelf products and make it usable for the mainstream (e.g. using a Raspberry Pi).

== Legal requirements for distributed generation ==

In 2010 Colorado enacted a law requiring that by 2020 that 3% of the power generated in Colorado utilize distributed generation of some sort.

On 11 October 2017, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill, SB 338, that makes utility companies plan &quot;carbon-free alternatives to gas generation&quot; in order to meet peak demand. The law requires utilities to evaluate issues such as energy storage, efficiency, and distributed energy resources.

<text>The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment is one of two large general-purpose particle physics detectors built on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Switzerland and France. The goal of the CMS experiment is to investigate a wide range of physics, including the search for the Higgs boson, extra dimensions, and particles that could make up dark matter.

CMS is 21 metres long, 15 m in diameter, and weighs about 14,000 tonnes. Over 4,000 people, representing 206 scientific institutes and 47 countries, form the CMS collaboration who built and now operate the detector. It is located in a cavern at Cessy in France, just across the border from Geneva. In July 2012, along with ATLAS, CMS tentatively discovered the Higgs boson. 
By March 2013 its existence was confirmed.

==Background==
Recent collider experiments such as the now-dismantled Large Electron-Positron Collider and the newly renovated Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, as well as the () recently closed Tevatron at Fermilab have provided remarkable insights into, and precision tests of, the Standard Model of Particle Physics. A principal achievement of these experiments (specifically of the LHC) is the discovery of a particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson, the particle resulting from the Higgs mechanism, which provides an explanation for the masses of elementary particles.

However, there are still many questions that future collider experiments hope to answer. These include uncertainties in the mathematical behaviour of the Standard Model at high energies, tests of proposed theories of dark matter (including supersymmetry), and the reasons for the imbalance of matter and antimatter observed in the Universe.

==Physics goals==

The main goals of the experiment are:
* to explore physics at the TeV scale
* to further study the properties of the Higgs boson, already discovered by CMS and ATLAS
* to look for evidence of physics beyond the standard model, such as supersymmetry, or extra dimensions
* to study aspects of heavy ion collisions.

The ATLAS experiment, at the other side of the LHC ring is designed with similar goals in mind, and the two experiments are designed to complement each other both to extend reach and to provide corroboration of findings. CMS and ATLAS uses different technical solutions and design of its detector magnet system to achieve the goals.

==Detector summary==
CMS is designed as a general-purpose detector, capable of studying many aspects of proton collisions at 0.9–13.6 TeV, the center-of-mass energy of the LHC particle accelerator.

The CMS detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. This takes the form of a cylindrical coil of superconducting cable that generates a magnetic field of 4 tesla, about 100 000 times that of the Earth. The magnetic field is confined by a steel &#x27;yoke&#x27; that forms the bulk of the detector&#x27;s weight at 12,500 t. An unusual feature of the CMS detector is that instead of being built in-situ underground, like the other giant detectors of the LHC experiments, it was constructed on the surface, before being lowered underground in 15 sections and reassembled.

It contains subsystems which are designed to measure the energy and momentum of photons, electrons, muons, and other products of the collisions. The innermost layer is a silicon-based tracker. Surrounding it is a scintillating crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, which is itself surrounded with a sampling calorimeter for hadrons. The tracker and the calorimetry are compact enough to fit inside the CMS solenoid, which generates a powerful magnetic field of 3.8 T. Outside the magnet are the large muon detectors, which are inside the return yoke of the magnet.
==CMS by layers==
For full technical details about the CMS detector, please see the Technical Design Report.

===The interaction point===
This is the point in the centre of the detector at which proton-proton collisions occur between the two counter-rotating beams of the LHC. At each end of the detector magnets focus the beams into the interaction point. At collision each beam has a radius of 17 μm and the crossing angle between the beams is 285 μrad.

At full design luminosity each of the two LHC beams will contain 2,808 bunches of protons. The interval between crossings is 25 ns, although the number of collisions per second is only 31.6 million due to gaps in the beam as injector magnets are activated and deactivated.

At full luminosity each collision will produce an average of 20 proton-proton interactions. The collisions occur at a centre of mass energy of 8 TeV. But, it is worth noting that for studies of physics at the electroweak scale, the scattering events are initiated by a single quark or gluon from each proton, and so the actual energy involved in each collision will be lower as the total centre of mass energy is shared by these quarks and gluons (determined by the parton distribution functions).

The first test which ran in September 2008 was expected to operate at a lower collision energy of 10 TeV but this was prevented by the 19 September 2008 shutdown. When at this target level, the LHC will have a significantly reduced luminosity, due to both fewer proton bunches in each beam and fewer protons per bunch. The reduced bunch frequency does allow the crossing angle to be reduced to zero however, as bunches are far enough spaced to prevent secondary collisions in the experimental beampipe.

===Layer 1 – The tracker===
Momentum of particles is crucial in helping us to build up a picture of events at the heart of the collision. One method to calculate the momentum of a particle is to track its path through a magnetic field; the more curved the path, the less momentum the particle had. The CMS tracker records the paths taken by charged particles by finding their positions at a number of key points.

The tracker can reconstruct the paths of high-energy muons, electrons and hadrons (particles made up of quarks) as well as see tracks coming from the decay of very short-lived particles such as beauty or &quot;b quarks&quot; that will be used to study the differences between matter and antimatter.

The tracker needs to record particle paths accurately yet be lightweight so as to disturb the particle as little as possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each measurement is accurate to 10 μm, a fraction of the width of a human hair. It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.

The CMS tracker is made entirely of silicon: the pixels, at the very core of the detector and dealing with the highest intensity of particles, and the silicon microstrip detectors that surround it. As particles travel through the tracker the pixels and microstrips produce tiny electric signals that are amplified and detected. The tracker employs sensors covering an area the size of a tennis court, with 75 million separate electronic read-out channels: in the pixel detector there are some 6,000 connections per square centimetre.

The CMS silicon tracker consists of 14 layers in the central region and 15 layers in the endcaps. The innermost four layers (up to 16 cm radius) consist of 100 × 150 μm pixels, 124 million in total. The pixel detector was upgraded as a part of the CMS phase-1 upgrade in 2017, which added an additional layer to both the barrel and endcap, 
and shifted the innermost layer 1.5 cm closer to the beamline. 

The next four layers (up to 55 cm radius) consist of silicon strips, followed by the remaining six layers of strips, out to a radius of 1.1 m. There are 9.6 million strip channels in total.

During full luminosity collisions the occupancy of the pixel layers per event is expected to be 0.1%, and 1–2% in the strip layers. The expected HL-LHC upgrade will increase the number of interactions to the point where over-occupancy would significantly reduce track-finding effectiveness. An upgrade is planned to increase the performance and the radiation tolerance of the tracker.

This part of the detector is the world&#x27;s largest silicon detector. It has 205 m2 of silicon sensors (approximately the area of a tennis court) in 9.3 million microstrip sensors comprising 76 million channels.

===Layer 2 – The Electromagnetic Calorimeter===
The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) is designed to measure with high accuracy the energies of electrons and photons.

The ECAL is constructed from crystals of lead tungstate, PbWO4. This is an extremely dense but optically clear material, ideal for stopping high energy particles. Lead tungstate crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than stainless steel, but with a touch of oxygen in this crystalline form it is highly transparent and scintillates when electrons and photons pass through it. This means it produces light in proportion to the particle&#x27;s energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast, short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast and fairly compact detector. It has a radiation length of χ0 = 0.89 cm, and has a rapid light yield, with 80% of light yield within one crossing time (25 ns). This is balanced however by a relatively low light yield of 30 photons per MeV of incident energy. The crystals used have a front size of 22 mm × 22 mm and a depth of 230 mm. They are set in a matrix of carbon fibre to keep them optically isolated, and backed by silicon avalanche photodiodes for readout.

The ECAL, made up of a barrel section and two &quot;endcaps&quot;, forms a layer between the tracker and the HCAL. The cylindrical &quot;barrel&quot; consists of 61,200 crystals formed into 36 &quot;supermodules&quot;, each weighing around three tonnes and containing 1,700 crystals. The flat ECAL endcaps seal off the barrel at either end and are made up of almost 15,000 further crystals.

For extra spatial precision, the ECAL also contains pre-shower detectors that sit in front of the endcaps. These allow CMS to distinguish between single high-energy photons (often signs of exciting physics) and the less interesting close pairs of low-energy photons.

At the endcaps the ECAL inner surface is covered by the pre-shower subdetector, consisting of two layers of lead interleaved with two layers of silicon strip detectors. Its purpose is to aid in pion-photon discrimination.

===Layer 3 – The Hadronic Calorimeter===

The Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) measures the energy of hadrons, particles made of quarks and gluons (for example protons, neutrons, pions and kaons). Additionally it provides indirect measurement of the presence of non-interacting, uncharged particles such as neutrinos.

The HCAL consists of layers of dense material (brass or steel) interleaved with tiles of plastic scintillators, read out via wavelength-shifting fibres by hybrid photodiodes. This combination was determined to allow the maximum amount of absorbing material inside of the magnet coil.

The high pseudorapidity region formula_1 is instrumented by the Hadronic Forward (HF) detector. Located 11 m either side of the interaction point, this uses a slightly different technology of steel absorbers and quartz fibres for readout, designed to allow better separation of particles in the congested forward region.
The HF is also used to measure the relative online luminosity system in CMS.

About half of the brass used in the endcaps of the HCAL used to be Russian artillery shells.

===Layer 4 – The magnet===
The CMS magnet is the central device around which the experiment is built, with a 4 Tesla magnetic field that is 100,000 times stronger than the Earth&#x27;s. CMS has a large solenoid magnet. This allows the charge/mass ratio of particles to be determined from the curved track that they follow in the magnetic field. It is 13 m long and 6 m in diameter, and its refrigerated superconducting niobium-titanium coils were originally intended to produce a 4 T magnetic field. The operating field was scaled down to 3.8 T instead of the full design strength in order to maximize longevity.

The inductance of the magnet is 14 Η and the nominal current for 4 T is 19,500 A, giving a total stored energy of 2.66 GJ, equivalent to about half-a-tonne of TNT. There are dump circuits to safely dissipate this energy should the magnet quench. The circuit resistance (essentially just the cables from the power converter to the cryostat) has a value of 0.1 mΩ which leads to a circuit time constant of nearly 39 hours. This is the longest time constant of any circuit at CERN. The operating current for 3.8 T is 18,160 A, giving a stored energy of 2.3 GJ.

The job of the big magnet is to bend the paths of particles emerging from high-energy collisions in the LHC. The more momentum a particle has the less its path is curved by the magnetic field, so tracing its path gives a measure of momentum. CMS began with the aim of having the strongest magnet possible because a higher strength field bends paths more and, combined with high-precision position measurements in the tracker and muon detectors, this allows accurate measurement of the momentum of even high-energy particles.

The tracker and calorimeter detectors (ECAL and HCAL) fit snugly inside the magnet coil whilst the muon detectors are interleaved with a 12-sided iron structure that surrounds the magnet coils and contains and guides the field. Made up of three layers this &quot;return yoke&quot; reaches out 14 metres in diameter and also acts as a filter, allowing through only muons and weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. The enormous magnet also provides most of the experiment&#x27;s structural support, and must be very strong itself to withstand the forces of its own magnetic field.

===Layer 5 – The muon detectors and return yoke===
As the name &quot;Compact Muon Solenoid&quot; suggests, detecting muons is one of CMS&#x27;s most important tasks. Muons are charged particles that are just like electrons and positrons, but are 200 times more massive. We expect them to be produced in the decay of a number of potential new particles; for instance, one of the clearest &quot;signatures&quot; of the Higgs Boson is its decay into four muons.

Because muons can penetrate several metres of iron without depositing a significant amount of energy, unlike most particles, they are not stopped by any of CMS&#x27;s calorimeters. Therefore, chambers to detect muons are placed at the very edge of the experiment where they are the only particles likely to register a signal.

To identify muons and measure their momenta, CMS uses three types of detector: drift tubes (DT), cathode strip chambers (CSC), resistive plate chambers (RPC), and Gas electron multiplier (GEM). The DTs are used for precise trajectory measurements in the central &quot;barrel&quot; region, while the CSCs are used in the &quot;end caps&quot;. The RPCs provide a fast signal when a muon passes through the muon detector, and are installed in both the barrel and the end caps.

The drift tube (DT) system measures muon positions in the barrel part of the detector. Each 4-cm-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a gas volume. When a muon or any charged particle passes through the volume it knocks electrons off the atoms of the gas. These follow the electric field ending up at the positively charged wire. By registering where along the wire electrons hit (in the diagram, the wires are going into the page) as well as by calculating the muon&#x27;s original distance away from the wire (shown here as horizontal distance and calculated by multiplying the speed of an electron in the tube by the time taken) DTs give two coordinates for the muon&#x27;s position. Each DT chamber, on average 2 m x 2.5 m in size, consists of 12 aluminium layers, arranged in three groups of four, each with up to 60 tubes: the middle group measures the coordinate along the direction parallel to the beam and the two outside groups measure the perpendicular coordinate.

Cathode strip chambers (CSC) are used in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged &quot;anode&quot; wires crossed with negatively charged copper &quot;cathode&quot; strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles to the wire direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.

Resistive plate chambers (RPC) are fast gaseous detectors that provide a muon trigger system parallel with those of the DTs and CSCs. RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity plastic material and separated by a gas volume. When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing an avalanche of electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one nanosecond (one billionth of a second).

Gas electron multiplier (GEM) detectors represent a new muon system in CMS, in order to complement the existing systems in the endcaps. The forward region is the part of CMS most affected by large radiation doses and high event rates. The GEM chambers will provide additional redundancy and measurement points, allowing a better muon track identification and also wider coverage in the very forward region. The CMS GEM detectors are made of three layers, each of which is a 50 μm thick copper-cladded polyimide foil. These chambers are filled with an Ar/CO2 gas mixture, where the primary ionisation due to incident muons will occur which subsequently result in an electron avalanche, providing an amplified signal.

New particles discovered in CMS will be typically unstable and rapidly transform into a cascade of lighter, more stable and better understood particles. Particles travelling through CMS leave behind characteristic patterns, or &quot;signatures&quot;, in the different layers, allowing them to be identified. The presence (or not) of any new particles can then be inferred.

===Trigger system===
To have a good chance of producing a rare particle, such as a Higgs boson, a very large number of collisions is required. Most collision events in the detector are &quot;soft&quot; and do not produce interesting effects. The amount of raw data from each crossing is approximately 1 megabyte, which at the 40 MHz crossing rate would result in 40 terabytes of data a second, an amount that the experiment cannot hope to store, let alone process properly. The full trigger system reduces the rate of interesting events down to a manageable 1,000 per second.

To accomplish this, a series of &quot;trigger&quot; stages are employed. All the data from each crossing is held in buffers within the detector while a small amount of key information is used to perform a fast, approximate calculation to identify features of interest such as high energy jets, muons or missing energy. This &quot;Level 1&quot; calculation is completed in around 1 μs, and event rate is reduced by a factor of about 1,000 down to 50 kHz. All these calculations are done on fast, custom hardware using reprogrammable field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

If an event is passed by the Level 1 trigger all the data still buffered in the detector is sent over fibre-optic links to the &quot;High Level&quot; trigger, which is software (mainly written in C++) running on ordinary computer servers. The lower event rate in the High Level trigger allows time for much more detailed analysis of the event to be done than in the Level 1 trigger. The High Level trigger reduces the event rate by a further factor of 100 down to 1,000 events per second. These are then stored on tape for future analysis.

===Data analysis===
Data that has passed the triggering stages and been stored on tape is duplicated using the Grid to additional sites around the world for easier access and redundancy. Physicists are then able to use the Grid to access and run their analyses on the data.

There are a huge range of analyses performed at CMS, including:
* Performing precision measurements of Standard Model particles, which allows both for furthering the knowledge of these particles and also for the collaboration to calibrate the detector and measure the performance of various components.
* Searching for events with large amounts of missing transverse energy, which implies the presence of particles that have passed through the detector without leaving a signature. In the Standard Model only neutrinos would traverse the detector without being detected but a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model theories contain new particles that would also result in missing transverse energy.
* Studying the kinematics of pairs of particles produced by the decay of a parent, such as the Z boson decaying to a pair of electrons or the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of tau leptons or photons, to determine various properties and mass of the parent.
* Looking at jets of particles to study the way the partons (quarks and gluons) in the collided protons have interacted, or to search for evidence of new physics that manifests in hadronic final states.
* Searching for high particle multiplicity final states (predicted by many new physics theories) is an important strategy because common Standard Model particle decays very rarely contain a large number of particles, and those processes that do are well understood.

==Milestones==

==Etymology==
The term Compact Muon Solenoid comes from the relatively compact size of the detector, the fact that it detects muons, and the use of solenoids in the detector. &quot;CMS&quot; is also a reference to the center-of-mass system, an important concept in particle physics.

<doc id="245969" wikidata="Q6452285" url="?curid=245969" title="Ulcer (dermatology)">
<text>An ulcer is a sore on the skin or a mucous membrane, accompanied by the disintegration of tissue. Ulcers can result in complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis and even subcutaneous fat. Ulcers are most common on the skin of the lower extremities and in the gastrointestinal tract. An ulcer that appears on the skin is often visible as an inflamed tissue with an area of reddened skin. A skin ulcer is often visible in the event of exposure to heat or cold, irritation, or a problem with blood circulation.

They can also be caused due to a lack of mobility, which causes prolonged pressure on the tissues. This stress in the blood circulation is transformed to a skin ulcer, commonly known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers. Ulcers often become infected, and pus forms.

==Signs and symptoms==
Skin ulcers appear as open craters, often round, with layers of skin that have eroded. The skin around the ulcer may be red, swollen, and tender. Patients may feel pain on the skin around the ulcer, and fluid may ooze from the ulcer. In some cases, ulcers can bleed and, rarely, patients experience fever. Ulcers sometimes seem not to heal; healing, if it does occur, tends to be slow. Ulcers that heal within 12 weeks are usually classified as acute, and longer-lasting ones as chronic.

Ulcers develop in stages. In stage 1 the skin is red with soft underlying tissue. In the second stage the redness of the skin becomes more pronounced, swelling appears, and there may be some blisters and loss of outer skin layers. During the next stage, the skin may become necrotic down through the deep layers of skin, and the fat beneath the skin may become exposed and visible. In stage 4, deeper necrosis usually occurs, the fat underneath the skin is completely exposed, and the muscle may also become exposed. In the last two stages the sore may cause a deeper loss of fat and necrosis of the muscle; in severe cases it can extend down to bone level, destruction of the bone may begin, and there may be sepsis of joints.

Chronic ulcers may be painful. Most patients complain of constant pain at night and during the day. Chronic ulcer symptoms usually include increasing pain, friable granulation tissue, foul odour, and wound breakdown instead of healing. Symptoms tend to worsen once the wound has become infected.

Venous skin ulcers that may appear on the lower leg, above the calf or on the lower ankle usually cause achy and swollen legs. If these ulcers become infected they may develop an unpleasant odour, increased tenderness and redness. Before the ulcer establishes definitively, there may be a dark red or purple skin over the affected area as well as a thickening, drying, and itchy skin.

Although skin ulcers do not seem of great concern at a first glance, they are worrying conditions especially in people with diabetes, as they are at risk of developing diabetic neuropathy.

Ulcers may also appear on the cheeks, soft palate, the tongue, and on the inside of the lower lip. These ulcers usually last from 7 to 14 days and can be painful.

===Discharges===
Different types of discharges from ulcer are:
* Serous, usually seen in healing ulcer
* Purulent, seen in infected ulcer. Yellow creamy discharge is observed in staphylococcal infection; bloody opalescent discharge in streptococcal infection, while greenish discharge is seen in the case of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; infection.
* Bloody (sanguineous), usually seen in malignant ulcers and in healing ulcers with healthy granulation tissue
* Seropurulent
* Serosanguinous
* Serous with sulphur granules, seen in actinomycosis
* Yellowish, as seen in tuberculous ulcer

== Causes ==
The wounds from which ulcers arise can be caused by a wide variety of factors, but the main cause is impaired blood circulation. Especially, chronic wounds and ulcers are caused by poor circulation, either through cardiovascular issues or external pressure from a bed or a wheelchair. A very common and dangerous type of skin ulcer is caused by what are called pressure-sensitive sores, more commonly called bed sores, which are frequent in people who are bedridden or who use wheelchairs for long periods.

Other causes producing skin ulcers include bacterial and viral infections, fungal infections and cancers. Blood disorders and chronic wounds can result in skin ulcers as well. Venous leg ulcers due to impaired circulation or a blood flow disorder are more common in the elderly.

Rare causes of skin ulcers include pyoderma gangraenosum, lesions caused by Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, morbus Behçet and infections that are usually seen in those who are immunocompromised, for example ecthyma gangraenosum. It is important to consider such causes if the skin ulcerations don&#x27;t show improvement with antibiotic treatments and when other systemic symptoms are present. It is advised not to use surgical procedures on ulcerations caused by Behçet or pyoderma gangraenosum since those diseases usually exhibit pathergy.

==Diagnosis==
===Grading===
Wagner&#x27;s grading of ulcer follows:

==Management==

===Investigations===
Some of the investigations done for ulcer are:
* Study of discharging fluid: Culture and sensitivity
* Edge biopsy: Edge contains multiplying cells
* Radiograph of affected area to look for periostitis or osteomyelitis
* Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of lymph node
* Chest X-ray and Mantoux test in suspected tuberculous ulcer

===Treatment===
Skin ulcers may take a very long time to heal. Treatment is typically to avoid the ulcer getting infected, remove any excess discharge, maintain a moist wound environment, control the edema, and ease pain caused by nerve and tissue damage.

Topical antibiotics are normally used to prevent the ulcer getting infected, and the wound or ulcer is usually kept clear of dead tissue through surgical debridement.

Commonly, as a part of the treatment, patients are advised to change their lifestyle if possible and to change their diet. Improving the circulation is important in treating skin ulcers, and patients are consequently usually recommended to exercise, stop smoking, and lose weight.

In recent years, advances have been made in accelerating healing of chronic wounds and ulcers. Chronic wounds produce fewer growth hormones than necessary for healing tissue, and healing may be accelerated by replacing or stimulating growth factors while controlling the formation of other substances that work against them.

Leg ulcers can be prevented by using compression stockings to prevent blood pooling and back flow. It is likely that a person who has had a skin ulcer will have it again; use of compression stockings every day for at least five years after the skin ulcer has healed may help to prevent recurrence.

There is limited evidence that negative-pressure wound therapy may be effective in reducing the time to healing of leg ulcers.

== Specific types ==
* Arterial insufficiency ulcer: mostly located on the lateral surface of the ankle or the distal digits
* Cortisol ulcer: caused by long term application of cortisol (steroid) topical creams to certain skin diseases.
* Diabetic foot ulcer: a major complication of diabetes mellitus, and probably the major component of the diabetic foot.
* Venous ulcer: thought to occur due to improper functioning of venous valves, usually of the legs

<doc id="245972" wikidata="Q526447" url="?curid=245972" title="Led Zeppelin Boxed Set">
<text>Led Zeppelin is a boxed set by English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was the first compilation of songs by the band (not counting &quot;Coda&quot;, which some sources list as a studio album) and the selection and remastering of the tracks were supervised by Jimmy Page.
Atlantic Records released it on 29 October 1990 on several formats: four compact discs, six vinyl records, or four cassette tapes. A 36-page booklet was also included with the release.

Debuting at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the box set was described by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Dennis Hunt as &quot;one of the most expensive albums ever to reach the Top 40&quot;, noting its retail price of $65 on CD and $55 on cassette.

==Background==
This set contains two previously unreleased tracks and one new mix. &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot; was recorded on 24 June 1969 at the BBC Maida Vale Studio. &quot;White Summer/Black Mountain Side&quot; was recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, London on 27 June 1969. The &quot;Moby Dick/Bonzo&#x27;s Montreux&quot; mix took place at the Atlantic Synclavier Suite in New York, in May 1990. It also includes the band&#x27;s only non-album B-side, &quot;Hey, Hey, What Can I Do&quot; of the 1970 single &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, previously unavailable on compact disc.

The set was released the same month as &quot;Remasters&quot;, a two-disc set containing selections from this one, plus a remastered version of &quot;Good Times Bad Times.&quot; To differentiate between the two sets, in some markets the larger set is listed under the title &quot;The Complete Collection&quot;. To further the confusion, in both cases this is different from &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set released three years later, which includes all nine of the band&#x27;s studio albums on ten discs, with the three extra tracks appended to &quot;Coda&quot;, along with the 1969 recording &quot;Baby Come On Home&quot;, first released on the two-disc &quot;Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2&quot;. The &quot;Moby Dick/Bonzo&#x27;s Montreux&quot; mix is also included in the promotional interview album &quot;Profiled&quot; (1990). Also three years after this release, the remaining Led Zeppelin tracks not appearing on this box set were issued on &quot;Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2&quot;.

<doc id="245973" wikidata="Q3245680" url="?curid=245973" title="Mouth ulcer">
<text>A mouth ulcer (aphtha), or sometimes called a canker sore or salt blister, is an ulcer that occurs on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity. Mouth ulcers are very common, occurring in association with many diseases and by many different mechanisms, but usually there is no serious underlying cause. Rarely, a mouth ulcer that does not heal may be a sign of oral cancer. These ulcers may form individually or multiple ulcers may appear at once (i.e., a &quot;crop&quot; of ulcers). Once formed, an ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection.

The two most common causes of oral ulceration are local trauma (e.g. rubbing from a sharp edge on a broken filling or braces, biting one&#x27;s lip, etc.) and aphthous stomatitis (&quot;canker sores&quot;), a condition characterized by the recurrent formation of oral ulcers for largely unknown reasons. Mouth ulcers often cause pain and discomfort and may alter the person&#x27;s choice of food while healing occurs (e.g. avoiding acidic, sugary, salty or spicy foods and beverages).

== Definition ==
An ulcer (; from Latin &quot;ulcus&quot;, &quot;ulcer, sore&quot;) is a break in the skin or mucous membrane with loss of surface tissue and the disintegration and necrosis of epithelial tissue. A &quot;mucosal ulcer&quot; is an ulcer which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane.

An ulcer is a tissue defect which has penetrated the epithelial-connective tissue border, with its base at a deep level in the submucosa, or even within muscle or periosteum. An ulcer is a deeper breach of epithelium compared to an erosion or excoriation, and involves damage to both epithelium and lamina propria.

An &quot;erosion&quot; is a superficial breach of the epithelium, with little damage to the underlying lamina propria. A &quot;mucosal erosion&quot; is an erosion which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane. Only the superficial epithelial cells of the epidermis or of the mucosa are lost, and the lesion can reach the depth of the basement membrane. Erosions heal without scar formation.

&quot;Excoriation&quot; is a term sometimes used to describe a breach of the epithelium which is deeper than an erosion but shallower than an ulcer. This type of lesion is tangential to the rete pegs and shows punctiform (small pinhead spots) bleeding, caused by exposed capillary loops.

== Causes ==
Mouth ulcers may be caused by physical means (for example accidental biting of the cheek), certain medical conditions (such as some vitamin deficiencies), or as an adverse effect of some medications.

== Pathophysiology ==

The exact pathogenesis is dependent upon the cause.

Simple mechanisms which predispose the mouth to trauma and ulceration are xerostomia (dry mouth – as saliva usually lubricates the mucous membrane and controls bacterial levels) and epithelial atrophy (thinning, e.g., after radiotherapy), making the lining more fragile and easily breached. Stomatitis is a general term meaning inflammation within the mouth, and often may be associated with ulceration.

Pathologically, the mouth represents a transition between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin, meaning that many gastrointestinal and cutaneous conditions can involve the mouth. Some conditions usually associated with the whole gastrointestinal tract may present only in the mouth, e.g., orofacial granulomatosis/oral Crohn&#x27;s disease.

Similarly, cutaneous (skin) conditions can also involve the mouth and sometimes only the mouth, sparing the skin. The different environmental conditions (saliva, thinner mucosa, trauma from teeth and food) mean that some cutaneous disorders which produce characteristic lesions on the skin produce only nonspecific lesions in the mouth. The vesicles and bullae of blistering mucocutaneous disorders progress quickly to ulceration in the mouth, because of moisture and trauma from food and teeth. The high bacterial load in the mouth means that ulcers may become secondarily infected. Cytotoxic drugs administered during chemotherapy target cells with fast turnovers such as malignant cells. However, the epithelia of the mouth also has a high turnover rate and makes oral ulceration (mucositis) a common side effect of chemotherapy.

Erosions, which involve the epithelial layer, are red in appearance since the underlying lamina propria shows through. When the full thickness of the epithelium is penetrated (ulceration), the lesion becomes covered with a fibrinous exudate and takes on a yellow-grey color. Because an ulcer is a breach of the normal lining, when seen in cross section, the lesion is a crater. A &quot;halo&quot; may be present, which is a reddening of the surrounding mucosa and is caused by inflammation. There may also be edema (swelling) around the ulcer. Chronic trauma may produce an ulcer with a keratotic (white, thickened mucosa) margin. Malignant lesions may ulcerate either because the tumor infiltrates the mucosa from adjacent tissues, or because the lesion originates within the mucosa itself, and the disorganized growth leads to a break in the normal architecture of the lining tissues. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signaling low levels of immunoglobulin in the oral mucous membranes. Chemotherapy, HIV, and mononucleosis are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation. Autoimmunity is also a cause of oral ulceration. Mucous membrane pemphigoid, an autoimmune reaction to the epithelial basement membrane, causes desquamation/ulceration of the oral mucosa.
Numerous aphthous ulcers could be indicative of an inflammatory autoimmune disease called Behçet&#x27;s disease. This can later involve skin lesions and uveitis in the eyes. Vitamin C deficiency may lead to scurvy which impairs wound healing, which can contribute to ulcer formation. For a detailed discussion of the pathophysiology of aphthous stomatitis, see Aphthous stomatitis#Causes.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of mouth ulcers usually consists of a medical history followed by an oral examination as well as examination of any other involved area. The following details may be pertinent: The duration that the lesion has been present, the location, the number of ulcers, the size, the color and whether it is hard to touch, bleeds or has a rolled edge. As a general rule, a mouth ulcer that does not heal within 2 or 3 weeks should be examined by a health care professional who is able to rule out oral cancer (e.g. a dentist, oral physician, oral surgeon, or maxillofacial surgeon). If there have been previous ulcers that have healed, then this again makes cancer unlikely.

An ulcer that keeps forming on the same site and then healing may be caused by a nearby sharp surface, and ulcers that heal and then recur at different sites are likely to be recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Malignant ulcers are likely to be single in number, and conversely, multiple ulcers are very unlikely to be oral cancer. The size of the ulcers may be helpful in distinguishing the types of RAS, as can the location (minor RAS mainly occurs on non-keratinizing mucosa, major RAS occurs anywhere in the mouth or oropharynx). Induration, contact bleeding and rolled margins are features of a malignant ulcer. There may be nearby causative factor, e.g. a broken tooth with a sharp edge that is traumatizing the tissues. Otherwise, the person may be asked about problems elsewhere, e.g. ulceration of the genital mucous membranes, eye lesions or digestive problems, swollen glands in neck (lymphadenopathy) or a general unwell feeling.

The diagnosis comes mostly from the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (vitamin deficiency, anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or urinalysis (diabetes). A biopsy (minor procedure to cut out a small sample of the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected. Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch and sore. They usually have an irregular border with erythematous margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Due to various factors (saliva, relative thinness of oromucosa, trauma from teeth, chewing, etc.), vesicles and bullae which form on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity tend to be fragile and quickly break down to leave ulcers.

Aphthous stomatitis and local trauma are very common causes of oral ulceration; the many other possible causes are all rare in comparison.

==== Traumatic ulceration ====

Most mouth ulcers that are not associated with recurrent aphthous stomatitis are caused by local trauma. The mucous membrane lining of the mouth is thinner than the skin, and easily damaged by mechanical, thermal (heat/cold), chemical, or electrical means, or by irradiation.
==== Mechanical ====

Common causes of oral ulceration include rubbing on sharp edges of teeth, fillings, crowns, false teeth (dentures), or braces (orthodontic appliances), or accidental biting caused by a lack of awareness of painful stimuli in the mouth (e.g., following local anesthetic used during dental treatment, which the person becomes aware of as the anesthetic wears off).

Eating hard foods (e.g., potato chips) can damage the lining of the mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of deliberate self-harm (factitious ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury).

Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, where incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of petroleum jelly to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize this.

The lingual frenum is also vulnerable to ulceration by repeated friction during oral sexual activity (&quot;cunnilingus tongue&quot;). Rarely, infants can ulcerate the tongue or lower lip with the teeth, termed Riga-Fede disease.

==== Thermal and electrical burn ====
Thermal burns usually result from placing hot food or beverages in the mouth. This may occur in those who eat or drink before a local anesthetic has worn off. The normal painful sensation is absent and a burn may occur. Microwave ovens sometimes produce food that is cold externally and very hot internally, and this has led to a rise in the frequency of intra-oral thermal burns. Thermal food burns are usually on the palate or posterior buccal mucosa, and appear as zones of erythema and ulceration with necrotic epithelium peripherally. Electrical burns more commonly affect the oral commissure (corner of the mouth). The lesions are usually initially painless, charred and yellow with little bleeding. Swelling then develops and by the fourth day following the burn the area becomes necrotic and the epithelium sloughs off.

Electrical burns in the mouth are usually caused by chewing on live electrical wiring (an act that is relatively common among young children). Saliva acts as a conducting medium and an electrical arc flows between the electrical source and the tissues, causing extreme heat and possible tissue destruction.

==== Chemical injury ====
Caustic chemicals may cause ulceration of the oral mucosa if they are of strong-enough concentration and in contact for a sufficient length of time. The holding of medication in the mouth instead of swallowing it occurs mostly in children, those under psychiatric care, or simply because of a lack of understanding. Holding an aspirin tablet next to a painful tooth in an attempt to relieve pulpitis (toothache) is common, and leads to epithelial necrosis. Chewable aspirin tablets should be swallowed, with the residue quickly cleared from the mouth.

Other caustic medications include eugenol and chlorpromazine. Hydrogen peroxide, used to treat gum disease, is also capable of causing epithelial necrosis at concentrations of 1–3%. Silver nitrate, sometimes used for pain relief from aphthous ulceration, acts as a chemical cauterant and destroys nerve endings, but the mucosal damage is increased. Phenol is used during dental treatment as a cavity sterilizing agent and cauterizing material, and it is also present in some over-the-counter agents intended to treat aphthous ulcerations. Mucosal necrosis has been reported to occur with concentrations of 0.5%. Other materials used in endodontics are also caustic, which is part of the reason why use of a rubber dam is now recommended.

==== Irradiation ====
As a result of radiotherapy to the mouth, radiation-induced stomatitis may develop, which can be associated with mucosal erosions and ulceration. If the salivary glands are irradiated, there may also be xerostomia (dry mouth), making the oral mucosa more vulnerable to frictional damage as the lubricating function of saliva is lost, and mucosal atrophy (thinning), which makes a breach of the epithelium more likely. Radiation to the bones of the jaws causes damage to osteocytes and impairs the blood supply. The affected hard tissues become hypovascular (reduced number of blood vessels), hypocellular (reduced number of cells), and hypoxic (low levels of oxygen). Osteoradionecrosis is the term for when such an area of irradiated bone does not heal from this damage. This usually occurs in the mandible, and causes chronic pain and surface ulceration, sometimes resulting in non-healing bone being exposed through a soft tissue defect. Prevention of osteradionecrosis is part of the reason why all teeth of questionable prognosis are removed before the start of a course of radiotherapy.

==== Aphthous stomatitis ====

Aphthous stomatitis (also termed recurrent aphthous stomatitis, RAS, and commonly called &quot;canker sores&quot;) is a very common cause of oral ulceration. 10–25% of the general population have this non-contagious condition. Three types of aphthous stomatitis exists based on their appearance, namely minor, major and herpetiform major aphthous ulceration. Minor aphthous ulceration is the most common type, presenting with 1–6 small (2-4mm diameter), round/oval ulcers with a yellow-grey color and an erythematous (red) &quot;halo&quot;. These ulcers heal with no permanent scarring in about 7–10 days. Ulcers recur at intervals of about 1–4 months. Major aphthous ulceration is less common than the minor type, but produces more severe lesions and symptoms. Major aphthous ulceration presents with larger (&gt;1 cm diameter) ulcers that take much longer to heal (10–40 days) and may leave scarring. The minor and major subtypes of aphthous stomatitis usually produce lesions on the non-keratinized oral mucosa (i.e. the inside of the cheeks, lips, underneath the tongue and the floor of mouth), but less commonly major aphthous ulcers may occur in other parts of the mouth on keratinized mucosal surfaces. The least common type is herpetiform ulceration, so named because the condition resembles primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. Herpetiform ulcers begin as small blisters (vesicles) which break down into 2-3mm sized ulcers. Herpetiform ulcers appear in &quot;crops&quot; sometimes hundreds in number, which can coalesce to form larger areas of ulceration. This subtype may cause extreme pain, heals with scarring and may recur frequently.

The exact cause of aphthous stomatitis is unknown, but there may be a genetic predisposition in some people. Other possible causes include hematinic deficiency (folate, vitamin B, iron), stopping smoking, stress, menstruation, trauma, food allergies or hypersensitivity to sodium lauryl sulphate (found in many brands of toothpaste). Aphthous stomatitis has no clinically detectable signs or symptoms outside the mouth, but the recurrent ulceration can cause much discomfort to those affected. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pain and swelling and speeding healing, and may involve systemic or topical steroids, analgesics (pain killers), antiseptics, anti-inflammatories or barrier pastes to protect the raw area(s).

==== Infection ====

Many infections can cause oral ulceration (see table). The most common are herpes simplex virus (herpes labialis, primary herpetic gingivostomatitis), varicella zoster (chicken pox, shingles), and coxsackie A virus (hand, foot and mouth disease). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) creates immunodeficiencies which allow opportunistic infections or neoplasms to proliferate. Bacterial processes leading to ulceration can be caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (tuberculosis) and &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; (syphilis).

Opportunistic activity by combinations of otherwise normal bacterial flora, such as aerobic streptococci, &quot;Neisseria&quot;, &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, spirochetes, and &quot;Bacteroides&quot; species can prolong the ulcerative process. Fungal causes include &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot; (valley fever), &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot; (cryptococcosis), and &quot;Blastomyces dermatitidis&quot; (&quot;North American Blastomycosis&quot;). Entamoeba histolytica, a parasitic protozoan, is sometimes known to cause mouth ulcers through formation of cysts. Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer is a rare form of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases in which infiltrating, Epstein-Barr virus (i.e. EBV)-infected B cells cause solitary, well-circumscribed ulcers in mucous membranes and skin.

==== Drug-induced ====
Many drugs can cause mouth ulcers as a side effect. Common examples are alendronate (a bisphosphonate, commonly prescribed for osteoporosis), cytotoxic drugs (e.g. methotrexate, i.e. chemotherapy), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nicorandil (may be prescribed for angina) and propylthiouracil (e.g. used for hyperthyroidism). Some recreational drugs can cause ulceration, e.g. cocaine.

==== Malignancy ====
Rarely, a persistent, non-healing mouth ulcer may be a cancerous lesion. Malignancies in the mouth are usually carcinomas, but lymphomas, sarcomas and others may also be possible. Either the tumor arises in the mouth, or it may grow to involve the mouth, e.g. from the maxillary sinus, salivary glands, nasal cavity or peri-oral skin. The most common type of oral cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The main risk factors are long-term smoking and alcohol consumption (particularly when combined) and betel use.

Common sites of oral cancer are the lower lip, the floor of the mouth, and the sides, underside of the tongue and mandibular alveolar ridge, but it is possible to have a tumor anywhere in the mouth. Appearances vary greatly, but a typical malignant ulcer would be a persistent, expanding lesion that is totally red (erythroplasia) or speckled red and white (erythroleukoplakia). Malignant lesions also typically feel indurated (hardened) and attached to adjacent structures, with &quot;rolled&quot; margins or a punched out appearance and bleeds easily on gentle manipulation. If someone has an unexplained mouth ulcer persisting for more than 3 weeks this may indicate a need for a referral from the GDP or GP to hospital to exclude oral cancer.

==== Vesiculobullous diseases ====
Some of the viral infections mentioned above are also classified as vesiculobullous diseases. Other example vesiculobullous diseases include pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease, and epidermolysis bullosa.

====Allergy====

Rarely, allergic reactions of the mouth and lips may manifest as erosions; however, such reactions usually do not produce frank ulceration. An example of one common allergen is Balsam of Peru. If individuals allergic to this substance have oral exposure they may experience stomatitis and cheilitis (inflammation, rash, or painful erosion of the lips, oropharyngeal mucosa, or angles of their mouth). Balsam of Peru is used in foods and drinks for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties.

==== Other causes ====
A wide range of other diseases may cause mouth ulcers. Hematological causes include anemia, hematinic deficiencies, neutropenia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, other white cell dyscrasias, and gammopathies. Gastrointestinal causes include celiac disease, Crohn&#x27;s disease (orofacial granulomatosis), and ulcerative colitis. Dermatological causes include chronic ulcerative stomatitis, erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), angina bullosa haemorrhagica and lichen planus. Other examples of systemic disease capable of causing mouth ulcers include lupus erythematosus, Sweet syndrome, reactive arthritis, Behçet syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, periarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis, diabetes, glucagonoma, sarcoidosis and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis.

The conditions eosinophilic ulcer and necrotizing sialometaplasia may present as oral ulceration.

Macroglossia, an abnormally large tongue, can be associated with ulceration if the tongue protrudes constantly from the mouth. Caliber persistent artery describes a common vascular anomaly where a main arterial branch extends into superficial submucosal tissues without a reduction of diameter. This commonly occurs in elderly people on the lip and may be associated with ulceration. 

== Treatment ==
Treatment is cause-related, but also symptomatic if the underlying cause is unknown or not correctable. It is also important to note that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from:
* Smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma
* Addressing dry mouth
* Substituting a problem medication or switching to SLS-free toothpaste
* Maintaining good oral hygiene and use of an antiseptic mouthwash or spray (e.g. chlorhexidine), which can prevent secondary infection and therefore hasten healing
* A topical analgesic (e.g. benzydamine mouthwash) to reduce pain
* Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids may be used to reduce inflammation
* An antifungal drug may be used to prevent oral candidiasis developing in those who use prolonged steroids
* People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain
* Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people
* For recurrent ulcers, vitamin B12 has been shown to be effective

== Epidemiology ==
Oral ulceration is a common reason for people to seek medical or dental advice. A breach of the oral mucosa probably affects most people at various times during life. For a discussion of the epidemiology of aphthous stomatitis, see the epidemiology of aphthous stomatitis.

<text>In the field of databases in computer science, a transaction log (also transaction journal, database log, binary log or audit trail) is a history of actions executed by a database management system used to guarantee ACID properties over crashes or hardware failures. Physically, a log is a file listing changes to the database, stored in a stable storage format.

If, after a start, the database is found in an inconsistent state or not been shut down properly, the database management system reviews the database logs for uncommitted transactions and rolls back the changes made by these transactions. Additionally, all transactions that are already committed but whose changes were not yet materialized in the database are re-applied. Both are done to ensure atomicity and durability of transactions.

This term is not to be confused with other, human-readable logs that a database management system usually provides.
In database management systems, a journal is the record of data altered by a given process.

==Anatomy of a general database log==

A database log record is made up of: 

*&quot;Log Sequence Number&quot; (LSN): A unique ID for a log record. With LSNs, logs can be recovered in constant time. Most LSNs are assigned in monotonically increasing order, which is useful in recovery algorithms, like ARIES.
*&quot;Prev LSN&quot;: A link to their last log record. This implies database logs are constructed in linked list form.
*&quot;Transaction ID number&quot;: A reference to the database transaction generating the log record.
*&quot;Type&quot;: Describes the type of database log record.
*Information about the actual changes that triggered the log record to be written.

==Types of database log records==
All log records include the general log attributes above, and also other attributes depending on their type (which is recorded in the &quot;Type&quot; attribute, as above).

*Update Log Record notes an update (change) to the database. It includes this extra information:
**&quot;PageID&quot;: A reference to the Page ID of the modified page.
**&quot;Length and Offset&quot;: Length in bytes and offset of the page are usually included.
**&quot;Before and After Images&quot;: Includes the value of the bytes of page before and after the page change. Some databases may have logs which include one or both images.
*Compensation Log Record (CLR) notes the rollback of a particular change to the database. Each corresponds with exactly one other Update Log Record (although the corresponding update log record is not typically stored in the Compensation Log Record). It includes this extra information:
**&quot;undoNextLSN&quot;: This field contains the LSN of the next log record that is to be undone for transaction that wrote the last Update Log.
*Commit Record notes a decision to commit a transaction.
*Abort Record notes a decision to abort and hence roll back a transaction.
*Checkpoint Record notes that a checkpoint has been made. These are used to speed up recovery. They record information that eliminates the need to read a long way into the log&#x27;s past. This varies according to checkpoint algorithm. If all dirty pages are flushed while creating the checkpoint (as in PostgreSQL), it might contain:
**&quot;redoLSN&quot;: This is a reference to the first log record that corresponds to a dirty page. i.e. the first update that wasn&#x27;t flushed at checkpoint time. This is where redo must begin on recovery.
**&quot;undoLSN&quot;: This is a reference to the oldest log record of the oldest in-progress transaction. This is the oldest log record needed to undo all in-progress transactions.
*Completion Record notes that all work has been done for this particular transaction. (It has been fully committed or aborted)

<text>Hampstead Heath is an ancient heath in London, spanning . This grassy public space sits astride a sandy ridge, one of the highest points in London, running from Hampstead to Highgate, which rests on a band of London Clay. The heath is rambling and hilly, embracing ponds, recent and ancient woodlands, a lido, playgrounds, and a training track, and it adjoins the former stately home of Kenwood House and its estate. The south-east part of the heath is Parliament Hill, from which the view over London is protected by law.

Running along its eastern perimeter is a chain of ponds – including three open-air public swimming pools – which were originally reservoirs for drinking water from the River Fleet. The heath is a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation, and part of Kenwood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Lakeside concerts are held there in summer. The heath is managed by the City of London Corporation, and lies mostly within the London Borough of Camden with the adjoining Hampstead Heath Extension and Golders Hill Park in the London Borough of Barnet.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Archaeological discoveries on Hampstead Heath, including tools from the Mesolithic, pits, postholes, and charred stones, point to the presence of a hunter-gatherer community around 7000 BC.

Documentary evidence of Hampstead Heath dates from 986, when Ethelred the Unready granted five hides of land at &quot;Hemstede&quot; to the Abbot of Westminster. This same land is later recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as held by the monastery of St. Peter&#x27;s at Westminster Abbey, and by then is known as the &quot;Manor of Hampstead&quot;. Westminster held the land until 1133 when control of part of the manor was released to Richard de Balta; then during Henry II&#x27;s reign the whole of the manor became privately owned by Alexander de Barentyn, the King&#x27;s butler.

===19th century legal and political battles===
In 1767, the Manor of Hampstead and the estate which went with it came into the possession of the Wilson family following the marriage of General Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson, sixth baronet, to Jane Weller, niece and heir of the Revd. John Maryon. The estate consisted of , being mainly farmland to the west and north west of the village and including the heath.

From 1808 to 1814 Hampstead Heath hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth.

In 1821 Sir Thomas Maryon Wilson, eighth baronet, inherited the estate from his father. The construction of the Finchley Road through Hampstead promised to open up the land for development, but under the terms of his father&#x27;s will, Sir Thomas could neither sell any of the land nor grant leases on it for periods greater than 21 years, thus making it unsuitable for building. 

In 1829 Sir Thomas tried to circumvent the will by promoting a bill in Parliament which would have allowed him to grant leases of up to 99 years. This was a straightforward procedure and would normally have been passed without difficulty. But because the bill included a provision to build on the heath, it attracted considerable opposition. This came partly from individuals who held certain rights under the ancient system of copyhold, and also from influential figures who valued the heath as a natural asset and a place of recreation. The bill was passed by the House of Lords but was rejected by the House of Commons.

In 1830 Sir Thomas lodged a second bill. This specifically excluded the heath from development, but it did not exclude the East Park Estate which lay between the eastern part of the heath and Lord Mansfield&#x27;s estate at Kenwood and Parliament Hill Fields. This bill also attracted opposition, on the grounds that if building was allowed on the East Park Estate, the East Heath would be surrounded by houses and its natural beauty would be lost. This bill also failed.

Sir Thomas was to spend most of the rest of his life trying to obtain permission to grant leases for building. The matter became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, with the opposition being led by such influential figures as John Gurney Hoare and Lord Mansfield.

Although unable to grant leases for building, there was nothing to prevent Sir Thomas from undertaking his own building work. In the mid 1840s, he drew up plans to build 28 villas on the East Park Estate. Work was started on an access road, a wall and a gamekeeper&#x27;s hut, remnants of which still survive. However, because of landslips and problems of water penetration, attempts to build a viaduct to carry the road failed and the entire project was abandoned.

In 1866 the Hampstead Heath Protection Fund Committee was formed, a forerunner of the Heath &amp; Hampstead Society which still campaigns to protect the heath.

In 1869 Sir Thomas died and the estate passed to his brother, Sir John Maryon Wilson. By now there was considerable pressure for public ownership of the heath. This was led by the Commons Preservation Society, which had been formed in 1865 with the specific aim of protecting common land.
In 1870 the Metropolitan Board of Works agreed to buy the heath on behalf of the public at a cost of £45,000 plus £2,000 for legal fees. The board also agreed to compensate the copyholders for the loss of their rights. The (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. lxxvii) was passed, stating that it would be &quot;of great advantage to the inhabitants of the Metropolis if the Heath were always kept unenclosed and unbuilt on, its natural aspect and state being as far as may be preserved.&quot;

Pressure then grew to purchase the East Park Estate and the Parliament Hill Fields, but no funds were available for this. A public fund-raising campaign was launched, led by the philanthropist Baroness Burdett-Coutts and the campaigner Octavia Hill. This succeeded in raising the required £300,000, and in 1899 the East Park Estate and Parliament Hill Fields were added to the heath.

=== Later extensions ===

The Heath was further extended in 1898 with the purchase of Golders Hill Park for £38,000 from the estate of Sir Thomas Spencer Wells.

In 1904 following a campaign led by Henrietta Barnett, Wyldes Farm was purchased from Eton College. This land too was added to the Heath, and it is now known as the Heath Extension. The rest of Wyldes Farm was purchased by Henrietta Barnett to found the Hampstead Garden Suburb. Another fund-raising campaign led by Arthur Crosfield enabled part of Kenwood to be purchased. This land was added to the Heath in 1922. Finally, Kenwood House and its adjacent ground were incorporated into the Heath in 1928 following a bequest by their owner, the Earl of Iveagh.

=== Railway controversy ===

A fresh controversy arose in 1900 when the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway submitted a parliamentary bill for an underground railway line between Hampstead and Golders Green. The company already had powers to build a line from Charing Cross to Hampstead, terminating at a station in Heath Street. That line would follow the course of existing streets and was therefore uncontroversial. The proposed extension, however, would involve tunnelling under part of the Heath. The Heath &amp; Hampstead Society opposed the scheme on the basis that the tunnels would drain the sub-soil and that the vibration of passing trains would damage trees. The campaign received support from &quot;The Times&quot;, which published a strongly-worded editorial opposing the railway. But the claims were refuted by the railway company, who argued that the tunnels would be passing through impermeable clay at a depth of more than and would therefore have no effect on the Heath&#x27;s ecology.

The bill was passed by Parliament, receiving its royal assent on 18 November 1902. The line, from Charing Cross to Golders Green, was opened in 1907. It now forms part of the London Underground Northern line.

=== Recent developments ===
The City of London Corporation has managed the heath since 1989. Before that it was managed by the Greater London Council (GLC) and before that by the London County Council (LCC).

In 2021 &quot;Quiet Parks International&quot;, a non-profit organisation whose aim is to identify locations around the world that remain free from human-made noise for at least brief periods, gave Hampstead Heath &quot;Urban Quiet Park&quot; status.

In September 2023 sheep made a return to Hampstead Heath as part of an initiative by the City of London Corporation. The initiative aimed to enhance biodiversity through controlled grazing, utilizing a flock of five rare-breed Norfolk Horn and Oxford Down. This followed a successful trial in 2019 which was the first instance of sheep grazing on the Heath since the 1950s.

==Geography==
Part of the heath sits astride a sandy ridge that runs from east to west and rests on a band of London clay. Its highest point is at . As the sand was easily penetrated by rainwater which was then held by the clay, a landscape of swampy hollows, springs and man-made excavations was created. Hampstead Heath contains the largest single area of common land in Greater London, with of protected commons.

Public transport near the heath includes:
* London Overground railway stations: Hampstead Heath and Gospel Oak
* London Underground stations: Hampstead and Belsize Park to the south; Golders Green to the north-west; Highgate and Archway to the east and Kentish Town to the south-east.

Buses serve several roads around the heath.

==Areas of the heath==
The heath&#x27;s include a number of distinct areas.

===Whitestone, Highgate and Hampstead Ponds===

Hampstead Heath has over 25 ponds; most of these are in two distinct areas: the Highgate Ponds and the Hampstead Ponds.

====Whitestone Pond====
Whitestone Pond is a roughly triangular pond, centrally located on the heath&#x27;s south side and north-northwest of Queen Mary&#x27;s House (formerly a care home and before that a maternity hospital), across busy Heath Street (A502). Originally a small dew pond called the Horse Pond, it was renamed after a waypoint stone and is artificially fed. It has an exposed location, closely surrounded by roads, which limits its recreational use. It is the heath&#x27;s best known body of water, and many people&#x27;s introduction to Hampstead Heath&#x27;s ponds.

====Highgate Ponds====

Highgate Ponds are a series of eight former reservoirs, on the heath&#x27;s east (Highgate) side, and were originally dug in the 17th and 18th centuries. They include two single-sex swimming pools (the men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; bathing ponds), a model boating pond, and two ponds which serve as wildlife reserves: the Stock Pond and the Bird Sanctuary Pond. Fishing is allowed in some of the ponds, although this is threatened by proposals to modify the dams.

The ponds are the result of the 1777 damming of Hampstead Brook (one of the Fleet River&#x27;s sources), by the Hampstead Water Company, which was formed in 1692 to meet London&#x27;s growing water demands.

&quot;Boudicca&#x27;s Mound&quot;, near the present men&#x27;s bathing pond, is a tumulus where, according to local legend, Queen Boudicca (Boadicea) was buried after she and 10,000 Iceni warriors were defeated at Battle Bridge. However, historical drawings and paintings of the area show no mound other than a 17th-century windmill.

====Hampstead Ponds====

The Hampstead Ponds are three ponds in the heath&#x27;s south-west corner, towards South End Green. Hampstead Pond No. 3 is the mixed bathing pond, where both sexes may swim.

====Pond maintenance====
In 2004 the City of London Corporation, rejected a proposal by the Hampstead Heath Winter Swimming Club to allow &quot;early-morning, self-regulated swimming in the mixed sex pond on Hampstead Heath&quot;; the Corporation argued that it risked legal action by the Health and Safety Executive if it allowed such swimming, since the Executive had refused to give assurances to the Corporation that it would not be prosecuted under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The swimmers successfully challenged this in the High Court, which in 2005 ruled that members of the swimming club had the right to swim at their own risk, and that the would not be liable under the Act for injuries as a result.

In January 2011 the City of London announced a scheme which it said would improve the safety of the dams, to guard against damage that might result from a very large, but rare storm hitting London. The proposed engineering modifications of the dams were aimed at ensuring that three dams complied with the 1975 Reservoir Act. With the passage of the 2010 Flood and Water Management Act the City of London was advised that all the dams on the heath would need to comply with the reservoir safety regulations. The proposed works in 2011 included recommendations to improve the water quality of the lake, which had suffered from algae blooms. The proposals for the pond dams were extensively modified in 2012–2014. The proposals were challenged by a consortium of groups and societies collectively called &quot;Dam Nonsense&quot;. However, with the dam project being now completed, many locals have begun to accept the changes as wildlife begins to soften the border between the artificial and the natural in this area.

===Caen Wood Towers===
To the north east of the heath is a derelict site within the conservation area comprising the grounds and mansion of the former Caen Wood Towers (renamed Athlone House in 1972). This historic building, currently in disrepair, was built in 1872 for Edward Brooke, aniline dye manufacturer (architect, Edward Salomons). In 1942 the building was taken for war service by the Royal Air Force and was used to house the RAF Intelligence School, although the &#x27;official&#x27; line was that it was a convalescence hospital. The Operational Record (Form 540) of RAF Station Highgate (currently in the National Archives, Kew) was declassified in the late 1990s and shows the true role of this building in wartime service. The building sustained 2 near misses from V-1 flying bombs in late 1944, causing damage and injuries to staff. The RAF Intelligence School remained in Caen Wood Towers until 1948, when the building was handed over to the Ministry of Health. It was then used as a hospital and finally a post-operative recovery lodge, before falling into disrepair in the 1980s. The NHS sold off this part of their estate in 2004 to a private businessman who is currently redeveloping much of the site; however the House and its gardens fall within the conservation area of Hampstead Heath.

=== Parliament Hill Fields ===

Parliament Hill Fields lies on the south and east of the heath. It officially became part of the heath in 1888. It contains various sporting facilities including an athletics track, tennis courts and Parliament Hill Lido. Parliament Hill itself is considered by some to be the focal point of the heath, with the highest part of it known to some as &quot;Kite Hill&quot; due to its suitability for kite flying. The hill is high and is notable for its excellent views of the London skyline. The skyscrapers of Canary Wharf and the City of London can be seen, along with St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and other landmarks, all in one panorama, parts of which are protected views. The main staff yards for the management of the heath are located at Parliament Hill Fields.

In the south-east of the heath, on the southern slopes of Parliament Hill, is the Gospel Oak Lido open air swimming pool, with a running track and fitness area to its north. Parliament Hill Fields was successfully defended from development in the late 19th Century by Octavia Hill and the Commons Preservation Society. 

===Kenwood===

The area to the north of the heath is the Kenwood Estate and House – a total area of which is maintained by English Heritage. This became part of the heath when it was bequeathed to the nation by Lord Iveagh on his death in 1927, and opened to the public in 1928. The original house dates from the early 17th century. The orangery was added in about 1700.

===Hampstead Heath Woods===

One third of the Kenwood estate (Ken Wood and North Wood) is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, designated by Natural England.
===The Vale of Health===
The Vale of Health is a hamlet accessed by a lane from East Heath Road; it is surrounded entirely by the heath. In 1714, one Samuel Hatch, a harness maker, built a workshop and was granted some land. By 1720, he had a cottage at what was subsequently called &quot;Hatch&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Hatchett&#x27;s Bottom&quot;. A new name, regarded as a deliberate attempt to change the image of a developing location, the &quot;Vale of Health&quot;, was recorded in 1801.

===Extension===
The Extension is an open space to the north-west of the main heath. It does not share the history of common and heathland of the rest of the heath. Instead it was created out of farmland, largely due to the efforts of Henrietta Barnett who went on to found Hampstead Garden Suburb. Its farmland origins can still be seen in the form of old field boundaries, hedgerows and trees.

===The Hill Garden and Pergola ===
The Hill Garden and Pergola lie to the west of Inverforth House (formerly The Hill), and were laid out from 1906 by Thomas Hayton Mawson as private gardens for Lord Leverhulme. After neglect in recent decades the garden and pergola are in the care of the City of London Corporation, are being restored, and are open to the public but locked at night. Several buildings within the garden are individually listed at grade II* or grade II. Those at grade II* include: the summerhouse at the western end of the pergola, which has extensive views over Hampstead Heath towards Harrow on the Hill; a summerhouse to the south of the garden; the southern pergola and terrace; the Cruciform pergola; a bridge; the Central Temple summerhouse; and the western pergola. The structures listed at grade II are: the pond and its architectural surround; and the garden terrace steps.

===Golders Hill Park===

Golders Hill Park is a formal park adjoining the West Heath. It occupies the site of a large house that was bombed during World War II. It has an expanse of grass, with a formal flower garden, a duck pond and a separate water garden that leads to a separate area for deer, near a recently renovated small zoo. The zoo has donkeys, maras, ring-tailed lemurs, ring-tailed coatis, white-cheeked turacos and European eagle-owls, among other animals. There are also tennis courts, a butterfly house and a putting green.

Unlike most of the rest of the heath, Golders Hill Park is fenced in, and is closed at night.

==Site of Special Scientific Interest==

Ken Wood and North Wood are a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest called Hampstead Heath Woods, designated by Natural England.

==Constabulary==
The heath is policed by the Hampstead Heath Constabulary, part of the City of London Corporation. Its constables are: From their inauguration until 24 May 2018 some constables worked with general purpose dogs, all licensed to NPCC/Home Office standards. They have been responsible for patrolling the Heath since 1992.

==Activities==
The heath is home to a range of activities, including 16 different sports. It is used by walkers, runners, swimmers and kite-flyers. Running events include the weekly parkrun and the annual Race for Life in aid of Cancer Research UK. Until February 2007 Kenwood held a series of popular lakeside concerts.

Facilities include an athletics track, a pétanque pitch, a volleyball court and eight separate children&#x27;s play areas, including an adventure playground.

Swimming takes place all year round in two of the three natural swimming ponds: the men&#x27;s pond which opened in the 1890s, and the ladies&#x27; pond which opened in 1925. The mixed pond is only open from May to September, though it is the oldest, having been in use since the 1860s.

The West Heath is regarded as a night-time gay cruising ground. George Michael revealed that he cruised on the heath, an activity he then parodied on the &quot;Extras&quot; Christmas Special.

==In popular culture==
While living in London, Karl Marx and his family went to the heath regularly, as their favourite outing.

John Atkinson Grimshaw, Victorian-era painter, painted an elaborate night-time scene of Hampstead Hill in oils. Hampstead Heath also provided the backdrop for the opening scene in Victorian writer Wilkie Collins&#x27; novel &quot;The Woman in White&quot;.

Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot; is partly set on Hampstead Heath, in scenes when the undead Lucy abducts children playing on the heath.

Hampstead Heath forms part of the location for G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s fictional story &quot;The Blue Cross&quot; from &quot;The Innocence of Father Brown&quot;.
The Heath is mentioned in Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; Symphony no. 2 &#x27;A London Symphony&#x27; with the subtitle &#x27;Hampstead Heath on an August Bank Holiday&#x27;.

The photos used for the cover of The Kinks″ LP &quot;The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society&quot; were taken on the Heath in August 1968. In some photographs, Witanhurst is visible in the background.

&quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999) featured scenes shot at the heath, located primarily around Kenwood House, where Julia Roberts&#x27; character was filming a movie.

In 2005, Giancarlo Neri&#x27;s sculpture &quot;The Writer&quot;, a 9-metre-tall table and chair, was exhibited on Hampstead Heath.

The film &quot;Scenes of a Sexual Nature&quot; (2006) was shot entirely on Hampstead Heath.

Colin Wilson slept rough (in a sleeping bag) on Hampstead Heath to save money when he was working on his first novel, &quot;Ritual in the Dark&quot;.

In John le Carré&#x27;s novel &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;, the heath is the murder scene of General Vladimir, a pivotal event that leads to the downfall of George Smiley&#x27;s nemesis Karla.

&quot;Hampstead&quot; is a 2017 film directed by Joel Hopkins about Harry Hallowes, who claimed squatter&#x27;s rights on a corner of the heath on which he lived in a makeshift camp.

<text>In commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, elimination theory is the classical name for algorithmic approaches to eliminating some variables between polynomials of several variables, in order to solve systems of polynomial equations.

Classical elimination theory culminated with the work of Francis Macaulay on multivariate resultants, as described in the chapter on &quot;Elimination theory&quot; in the first editions (1930) of Bartel van der Waerden&#x27;s &quot;Moderne Algebra&quot;. After that, elimination theory was ignored by most algebraic geometers for almost thirty years, until the introduction of new methods for solving polynomial equations, such as Gröbner bases, which were needed for computer algebra.

==History and connection to modern theories==
The field of elimination theory was motivated by the need of methods for solving systems of polynomial equations.

One of the first results was Bézout&#x27;s theorem, which bounds the number of solutions (in the case of two polynomials in two variables at Bézout time).

Except for Bézout&#x27;s theorem, the general approach was to &quot;eliminate&quot; variables for reducing the problem to a single equation in one variable.

The case of linear equations was completely solved by Gaussian elimination, where the older method of Cramer&#x27;s rule does not proceed by elimination, and works only when the number of equations equals the number of variables. In the 19th century, this was extended to linear Diophantine equations and abelian group with Hermite normal form and Smith normal form.

Before the 20th century, different types of &quot;eliminants&quot; were introduced, including &quot;resultants&quot;, and various kinds of &quot;discriminants&quot;. In general, these eliminants are also invariant under various changes of variables, and are also fundamental in invariant theory.

All these concepts are effective, in the sense that their definitions include a method of computation. Around 1890, David Hilbert introduced non-effective methods, and this was seen as a revolution, which led most algebraic geometers of the first half of the 20th century to try to &quot;eliminate elimination&quot;. Nevertheless Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, may be considered to belong to elimination theory, as it asserts that a system of polynomial equations does not have any solution if and only if one may eliminate all unknowns to obtain the constant equation 1 = 0.

Elimination theory culminated with the work of Leopold Kronecker, and finally Macaulay, who introduced multivariate resultants and U-resultants, providing complete elimination methods for systems of polynomial equations, which are described in the chapter on &quot;Elimination theory&quot; in the first editions (1930) of van der Waerden&#x27;s &quot;Moderne Algebra&quot;.

Later, elimination theory was considered old-fashioned and removed from subsequent editions of &quot;Moderne Algebra&quot;. It was generally ignored until the introduction of computers, and more specifically of computer algebra, which again made relevant the design of efficient elimination algorithms, rather than merely existence and structural results. The main methods for this renewal of elimination theory are Gröbner bases and cylindrical algebraic decomposition, introduced around 1970.

==Connection to logic==
There is also a logical facet to elimination theory, as seen in the Boolean satisfiability problem. In the worst case, it is presumably hard to eliminate variables computationally. &quot;Quantifier elimination&quot; is a term used in mathematical logic to explain that, in some theories, every formula is equivalent to a formula without quantifier. This is the case of the theory of polynomials over an algebraically closed field, where elimination theory may be viewed as the theory of the methods to make quantifier elimination algorithmically effective. Quantifier elimination over the reals is another example, which is fundamental in computational algebraic geometry.

<text>Buoyancy (), or upthrust is a net upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of a partially or fully immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus, the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. The pressure difference results in a net upward force on the object. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the pressure difference, and (as explained by Archimedes&#x27; principle) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the submerged volume of the object, i.e. the displaced fluid.

For this reason, an object whose average density is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink. If the object is less dense than the liquid, the force can keep the object afloat. This can occur only in a non-inertial reference frame, which either has a gravitational field or is accelerating due to a force other than gravity defining a &quot;downward&quot; direction.

Buoyancy also applies to fluid mixtures, and is the most common driving force of convection currents. In these cases, the mathematical modelling is altered to apply to continua, but the principles remain the same. Examples of buoyancy driven flows include the spontaneous separation of air and water or oil and water.

Buoyancy is a function of the force of gravity or other source of acceleration on objects of different densities, and for that reason is considered an apparent force, in the same way that centrifugal force is an apparent force as a function of inertia. Buoyancy can exist without gravity in the presence of an inertial reference frame, but without an apparent &quot;downward&quot; direction of gravity or other source of acceleration, buoyancy does not exist.

The center of buoyancy of an object is the center of gravity of the displaced volume of fluid.

== Archimedes&#x27; principle ==

Archimedes&#x27; principle is named after Archimedes of Syracuse, who first discovered this law in 212 BC. For objects, floating and sunken, and in gases as well as liquids (i.e. a fluid), Archimedes&#x27; principle may be stated thus in terms of forces:
—with the clarifications that for a sunken object the volume of displaced fluid is the volume of the object, and for a floating object on a liquid, the weight of the displaced liquid is the weight of the object.

More tersely: buoyant force = weight of displaced fluid.

Archimedes&#x27; principle does not consider the surface tension (capillarity) acting on the body, but this additional force modifies only the amount of fluid displaced and the spatial distribution of the displacement, so the principle that &quot;buoyancy = weight of displaced fluid&quot; remains valid.

The weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyancy force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravitational acceleration, g. Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy. This is also known as upthrust.

Suppose a rock&#x27;s weight is measured as 10 newtons when suspended by a string in a vacuum with gravity acting upon it. Suppose that when the rock is lowered into water, it displaces water of weight 3 newtons. The force it then exerts on the string from which it hangs would be 10 newtons minus the 3 newtons of buoyancy force: 10 − 3 = 7 newtons. Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of objects that have sunk completely to the sea floor. It is generally easier to lift an object up through the water than it is to pull it out of the water.

Assuming Archimedes&#x27; principle to be reformulated as follows,
:formula_1

then inserted into the quotient of weights, which has been expanded by the mutual volume

:formula_2

yields the formula below. The density of the immersed object relative to the density of the fluid can easily be calculated without measuring any volumes:

:formula_3

(This formula is used for example in describing the measuring principle of a dasymeter and of hydrostatic weighing.)

Example: If you drop wood into water, buoyancy will keep it afloat.

Example: A helium balloon in a moving car. During a period of increasing speed, the air mass inside the car moves in the direction opposite to the car&#x27;s acceleration (i.e., towards the rear). The balloon is also pulled this way. However, because the balloon is buoyant relative to the air, it ends up being pushed &quot;out of the way&quot;, and will actually drift in the same direction as the car&#x27;s acceleration (i.e., forward). If the car slows down, the same balloon will begin to drift backward. For the same reason, as the car goes round a curve, the balloon will drift towards the inside of the curve.

== Forces and equilibrium ==
The equation to calculate the pressure inside a fluid in equilibrium is:

:formula_4

where f is the force density exerted by some outer field on the fluid, and &quot;σ&quot; is the Cauchy stress tensor. In this case the stress tensor is proportional to the identity tensor:

: formula_5

Here &quot;δ&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is the Kronecker delta. Using this the above equation becomes:

:formula_6

Assuming the outer force field is conservative, that is it can be written as the negative gradient of some scalar valued function:

:formula_7

Then:

:formula_8

Therefore, the shape of the open surface of a fluid equals the equipotential plane of the applied outer conservative force field. Let the &quot;z&quot;-axis point downward. In this case the field is gravity, so Φ = −&quot;ρfgz&quot; where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration, &quot;ρf&quot; is the mass density of the fluid. Taking the pressure as zero at the surface, where &quot;z&quot; is zero, the constant will be zero, so the pressure inside the fluid, when it is subject to gravity, is

:formula_9

So pressure increases with depth below the surface of a liquid, as &quot;z&quot; denotes the distance from the surface of the liquid into it. Any object with a non-zero vertical depth will have different pressures on its top and bottom, with the pressure on the bottom being greater. This difference in pressure causes the upward buoyancy force.

The buoyancy force exerted on a body can now be calculated easily, since the internal pressure of the fluid is known. The force exerted on the body can be calculated by integrating the stress tensor over the surface of the body which is in contact with the fluid:

:formula_10

The surface integral can be transformed into a volume integral with the help of the Gauss theorem:

:formula_11

where &quot;V&quot; is the measure of the volume in contact with the fluid, that is the volume of the submerged part of the body, since the fluid does not exert force on the part of the body which is outside of it.

The magnitude of buoyancy force may be appreciated a bit more from the following argument. Consider any object of arbitrary shape and volume &quot;V&quot; surrounded by a liquid. The force the liquid exerts on an object within the liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid with a volume equal to that of the object. This force is applied in a direction opposite to gravitational force, that is of magnitude:

:formula_12

where &quot;ρf&quot; is the density of the fluid, &quot;Vdisp&quot; is the volume of the displaced body of liquid, and &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration at the location in question.

If this volume of liquid is replaced by a solid body of exactly the same shape, the force the liquid exerts on it must be exactly the same as above. In other words, the &quot;buoyancy force&quot; on a submerged body is directed in the opposite direction to gravity and is equal in magnitude to

:formula_13

Though the above derivation of Archimedes principle is correct, a recent paper by the Brazilian physicist Fabio M. S. Lima brings a more general approach for the evaluation of the buoyant force exerted by any fluid (even non-homogeneous) on a body with arbitrary shape. Interestingly, this method leads to the prediction that the buoyant force exerted on a rectangular block touching the bottom of a container points downward! Indeed, this downward buoyant force has been confirmed experimentally.

The net force on the object must be zero if it is to be a situation of fluid statics such that Archimedes principle is applicable, and is thus the sum of the buoyancy force and the object&#x27;s weight

:formula_14

If the buoyancy of an (unrestrained and unpowered) object exceeds its weight, it tends to rise. An object whose weight exceeds its buoyancy tends to sink. Calculation of the upwards force on a submerged object during its accelerating period cannot be done by the Archimedes principle alone; it is necessary to consider dynamics of an object involving buoyancy. Once it fully sinks to the floor of the fluid or rises to the surface and settles, Archimedes principle can be applied alone. For a floating object, only the submerged volume displaces water. For a sunken object, the entire volume displaces water, and there will be an additional force of reaction from the solid floor.

In order for Archimedes&#x27; principle to be used alone, the object in question must be in equilibrium (the sum of the forces on the object must be zero), therefore;

:formula_15

and therefore

:formula_16

showing that the depth to which a floating object will sink, and the volume of fluid it will displace, is independent of the gravitational field regardless of geographic location.
:(&quot;Note: If the fluid in question is seawater, it will not have the same density (&quot;ρ&quot;) at every location, since the density depends on temperature and salinity. For this reason, a ship may display a Plimsoll line.&quot;)

It can be the case that forces other than just buoyancy and gravity come into play. This is the case if the object is restrained or if the object sinks to the solid floor. An object which tends to float requires a tension restraint force T in order to remain fully submerged. An object which tends to sink will eventually have a normal force of constraint N exerted upon it by the solid floor. The constraint force can be tension in a spring scale measuring its weight in the fluid, and is how apparent weight is defined.

If the object would otherwise float, the tension to restrain it fully submerged is:

:formula_17

When a sinking object settles on the solid floor, it experiences a normal force of:

:formula_18

Another possible formula for calculating buoyancy of an object is by finding the apparent weight of that particular object in the air (calculated in Newtons), and apparent weight of that object in the water (in Newtons). To find the force of buoyancy acting on the object when in air, using this particular information, this formula applies:

: Buoyancy force = weight of object in empty space − weight of object immersed in fluid

The final result would be measured in Newtons.

Air&#x27;s density is very small compared to most solids and liquids. For this reason, the weight of an object in air is approximately the same as its true weight in a vacuum. The buoyancy of air is neglected for most objects during a measurement in air because the error is usually insignificant (typically less than 0.1% except for objects of very low average density such as a balloon or light foam).

=== Simplified model ===


A simplified explanation for the integration of the pressure over the contact area may be stated as follows:

Consider a cube immersed in a fluid with the upper surface horizontal.

The sides are identical in area, and have the same depth distribution, therefore they also have the same pressure distribution, and consequently the same total force resulting from hydrostatic pressure, exerted perpendicular to the plane of the surface of each side.

There are two pairs of opposing sides, therefore the resultant horizontal forces balance in both orthogonal directions, and the resultant force is zero.

The upward force on the cube is the pressure on the bottom surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal bottom surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the bottom surface.

Similarly, the downward force on the cube is the pressure on the top surface integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal top surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the top surface.

As this is a cube, the top and bottom surfaces are identical in shape and area, and the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the cube is directly proportional to the depth difference, and the resultant force difference is exactly equal to the weight of the fluid that would occupy the volume of the cube in its absence.

This means that the resultant upward force on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid that would fit into the volume of the cube, and the downward force on the cube is its weight, in the absence of external forces.

This analogy is valid for variations in the size of the cube.

If two cubes are placed alongside each other with a face of each in contact, the pressures and resultant forces on the sides or parts thereof in contact are balanced and may be disregarded, as the contact surfaces are equal in shape, size and pressure distribution, therefore the buoyancy of two cubes in contact is the sum of the buoyancies of each cube. This analogy can be extended to an arbitrary number of cubes.

An object of any shape can be approximated as a group of cubes in contact with each other, and as the size of the cube is decreased, the precision of the approximation increases. The limiting case for infinitely small cubes is the exact equivalence.

Angled surfaces do not nullify the analogy as the resultant force can be split into orthogonal components and each dealt with in the same way.

=== Static stability ===
A floating object is stable if it tends to restore itself to an equilibrium position after a small displacement. For example, floating objects will generally have vertical stability, as if the object is pushed down slightly, this will create a greater buoyancy force, which, unbalanced by the weight force, will push the object back up.

Rotational stability is of great importance to floating vessels. Given a small angular displacement, the vessel may return to its original position (stable), move away from its original position (unstable), or remain where it is (neutral).

Rotational stability depends on the relative lines of action of forces on an object. The upward buoyancy force on an object acts through the center of buoyancy, being the centroid of the displaced volume of fluid. The weight force on the object acts through its center of gravity. A buoyant object will be stable if the center of gravity is beneath the center of buoyancy because any angular displacement will then produce a &#x27;righting moment&#x27;.

The stability of a buoyant object at the surface is more complex, and it may remain stable even if the center of gravity is above the center of buoyancy, provided that when disturbed from the equilibrium position, the center of buoyancy moves further to the same side that the center of gravity moves, thus providing a positive righting moment. If this occurs, the floating object is said to have a positive metacentric height. This situation is typically valid for a range of heel angles, beyond which the center of buoyancy does not move enough to provide a positive righting moment, and the object becomes unstable. It is possible to shift from positive to negative or vice versa more than once during a heeling disturbance, and many shapes are stable in more than one position.

== Fluids and objects ==

As a submarine expels water from its buoyancy tanks, it rises because its volume is constant (the volume of water it displaces if it is fully submerged) while its mass is decreased.

=== Compressible objects ===
As a floating object rises or falls, the forces external to it change and, as all objects are compressible to some extent or another, so does the object&#x27;s volume. Buoyancy depends on volume and so an object&#x27;s buoyancy reduces if it is compressed and increases if it expands.

If an object at equilibrium has a compressibility less than that of the surrounding fluid, the object&#x27;s equilibrium is stable and it remains at rest. If, however, its compressibility is greater, its equilibrium is then unstable, and it rises and expands on the slightest upward perturbation, or falls and compresses on the slightest downward perturbation.

==== Submarines ====

Submarines rise and dive by filling large ballast tanks with seawater. To dive, the tanks are opened to allow air to exhaust out the top of the tanks, while the water flows in from the bottom. Once the weight has been balanced so the overall density of the submarine is equal to the water around it, it has neutral buoyancy and will remain at that depth. Most military submarines operate with a slightly negative buoyancy and maintain depth by using the &quot;lift&quot; of the stabilizers with forward motion.

==== Balloons ====
The height to which a balloon rises tends to be stable. As a balloon rises it tends to increase in volume with reducing atmospheric pressure, but the balloon itself does not expand as much as the air on which it rides. The average density of the balloon decreases less than that of the surrounding air. The weight of the displaced air is reduced. A rising balloon stops rising when it and the displaced air are equal in weight. Similarly, a sinking balloon tends to stop sinking.

==== Divers ====
Underwater divers are a common example of the problem of unstable buoyancy due to compressibility. The diver typically wears an exposure suit which relies on gas-filled spaces for insulation, and may also wear a buoyancy compensator, which is a variable volume buoyancy bag which is inflated to increase buoyancy and deflated to decrease buoyancy. The desired condition is usually neutral buoyancy when the diver is swimming in mid-water, and this condition is unstable, so the diver is constantly making fine adjustments by control of lung volume, and has to adjust the contents of the buoyancy compensator if the depth varies.

== Density ==
If the weight of an object is less than the weight of the displaced fluid when fully submerged, then the object has an average density that is less than the fluid and when fully submerged will experience a buoyancy force greater than its own weight. If the fluid has a surface, such as water in a lake or the sea, the object will float and settle at a level where it displaces the same weight of fluid as the weight of the object. If the object is immersed in the fluid, such as a submerged submarine or air in a balloon, it will tend to rise.
If the object has exactly the same density as the fluid, then its buoyancy equals its weight. It will remain submerged in the fluid, but it will neither sink nor float, although a disturbance in either direction will cause it to drift away from its position.
An object with a higher average density than the fluid will never experience more buoyancy than weight and it will sink.
A ship will float even though it may be made of steel (which is much denser than water), because it encloses a volume of air (which is much less dense than water), and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water.

<text>In linguistics, meronymy () is a semantic relation between a meronym denoting a part and a holonym denoting a whole. In simpler terms, a meronym is in a &quot;part-of&quot; relationship with its holonym. For example, &quot;finger&quot; is a meronym of &quot;hand,&quot; which is its holonym. Similarly, &quot;engine&quot; is a meronym of &quot;car,&quot; which is its holonym. Fellow meronyms (naming the various fellow parts of any particular whole) are called (for example, &quot;leaves&quot;, &quot;branches&quot;, &quot;trunk&quot;, and &quot;roots&quot; are comeronyms under the holonym of &quot;tree&quot;).

Holonymy () is the converse of meronymy.

A closely related concept is that of mereology, which specifically deals with part–whole relations and is used in logic. It is formally expressed in terms of first-order logic. A meronymy can also be considered a partial order.

Meronym and holonym refer to &quot;part&quot; and &quot;whole&quot; respectively, which is not to be confused with hypernym which refers to &quot;type&quot;. For example, a holonym of &quot;leaf&quot; might be &quot;tree&quot; (a leaf is a part of a tree), whereas a hypernym of &quot;oak tree&quot; might be &quot;tree&quot; (an oak tree is a type of tree).

<doc id="245989" wikidata="Q253056" url="?curid=245989" title="Ēostre">
<text>Ēostre () is a West Germanic spring goddess. The name is reflected in (; Northumbrian dialect: , Mercian and West Saxon dialects: ), , and . By way of the Germanic month bearing her name (Northumbrian: , West Saxon: ; ), she is the namesake of the festival of Easter in some languages. The Old English deity Ēostre is attested solely by Bede in his 8th-century work &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;, where Bede states that during (the equivalent of April), pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in Ēostre&#x27;s honour, but that this tradition had died out by his time, replaced by the Christian Paschal month, a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.

Additionally, scholars have linked the goddess&#x27;s name to a variety of Germanic personal names, a series of location names (toponyms), and, discovered in 1958, over 150 inscriptions from the 2nd century CE referring to the , goddesses with connected names venerated on the European continent.

By way of linguistic reconstruction, the matter of a goddess called in the Proto-Germanic language has been examined in detail since the foundation of Germanic philology in the 19th century by scholar Jacob Grimm and others. As the Germanic languages descend from Proto-Indo-European (PIE), historical linguists have traced the name to a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn *&quot;&quot;, from which may descend the Common Germanic divinity at the origin of the Old English &quot;Ēostre&quot; and the Old High German *&quot;Ôstara&quot;.

Theories connecting Ēostre with records of Germanic Easter customs, including hares and eggs, have been proposed. Whether the goddess was an invention of Bede has been a debate among some scholars, particularly prior to the discovery of the and further developments in Indo-European studies. Due to these latter developments, she is generally accepted as a genuine pagan goddess among modern scholars. Ēostre and Ostara are sometimes referenced in modern popular culture and are venerated in some forms of Germanic neopaganism.

==Name==

=== Etymology ===
The theonyms (Old English) and (Old High German) are cognates – linguistic siblings stemming from a common origin. They derive from the Proto-Germanic theonym , itself a descendant of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *&#x27; (cf. Lithuanian , &#x27;dawn, daybreak&#x27;), extended from the PIE root *&#x27;, meaning &#x27;to shine, glow (red)&#x27;. The modern English &quot;east&quot; also derives from this root, via the Proto-Germanic adverb (&#x27;east, eastwards&#x27;), from an earlier PIE *&quot;&quot; (&#x27;east, towards the dawn&#x27;).

According to linguist Guus Kroonen, the Germanic and Baltic languages replaced the old formation *&#x27;, the name of the PIE dawn-goddess, with a form in &#x27;, likewise found in the Lithuanian deity Aušrinė. In Anglo-Saxon England, her springtime festival gave its name to a month (Northumbrian: , West Saxon: ), the rough equivalent of April, then to the Christian feast of &quot;Easter&quot; that eventually displaced it. In southern Medieval Germany, the festival similarly gave its name to the month , and to the modern feast of (&#x27;Easter&#x27;), suggesting that a goddess named *Ôstara was also worshipped there. The name of the month survived into 18th-century German as . An Old Saxon equivalent of the spring goddess named *Āsteron may also be reconstructed from the term , which is translated by most scholars as &#x27;Easter-house&#x27;, which would parallel the Medieval Flemish (&#x27;Easter-house&#x27;). Frankish historian Einhard also writes in his (early 9th century CE) that after Charlemagne defeated and converted the continental Saxons to Christianity, he gave Germanic names to the Latin months of the year, which included the Easter-month .

The Old English is therefore a distant cognate of numerous other dawn goddesses attested among Indo-European-speaking peoples, including Uṣás, Ēṓs, and Aurōra. In the words of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture&quot;, &quot;a Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn is supported both by the evidence of cognate names and the similarity of mythic representation of the dawn goddess among various Indo-European groups.[...] All of this evidence permits us to posit a Proto-Indo-European *&quot;&quot; &#x27;goddess of dawn&#x27; who was characterized as a &#x27;reluctant&#x27; bringer of light for which she is punished. In three of the Indo-European stocks, Baltic, Greek and Indo-Iranian, the existence of a Proto-Indo-European &#x27;goddess of the dawn&#x27; is given additional linguistic support in that she is designated the &#x27;daughter of heaven&#x27;.&quot;

===Related names===
Additionally, scholars have linked the goddess&#x27;s name to a variety of Germanic personal names, a series of location names (toponyms) in England, and, discovered in 1958, over 150 inscriptions from the 2nd–3rd century CE referring to the .

A cluster of place names in England and a variety of English and continental Germanic names include the element *, an early Old English word reconstructed by linguists and potentially an earlier form of the goddess name Ēostre. The Council of Austerfield called by King Aldfrith of Northumbria shortly before 704 convened at a place described in contemporary records both as and , which have led to the site&#x27;s being identified with Austerfield near Bawtry in South Yorkshire. Such locations also include Eastry (, 788 CE) in Kent, Eastrea (, 966 CE) in Cambridgeshire, and Eastrington (, 959 CE) in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The element * also appears in the Old English name , a name borne by Bede&#x27;s monastery abbot in Wearmouth–Jarrow and which appears an additional three times in the Durham. The name also appears in the , and is likely the ancestor of the Middle English name . Various continental Germanic names include the element, including , and .

In 1958, over 150 Romano-Germanic votive inscriptions to the , a triad of goddesses, were discovered near Morken-Harff, Germany. They are datable to around 150–250 CE. Most of these inscriptions are in an incomplete state, yet many are at least reasonably legible. Some of these inscriptions refer to the . The name of these goddesses certainly derives from the stem &quot;austri&quot;-, which, if Germanic, would be cognate with the Old English &quot;Eostre&quot;, although the goddesses might equally have developed entirely independently.

==Description by Bede, 8th century==
 (&#x27;Ēostre&#x27;s month&#x27;) was the Anglo-Saxon name for the month of April. In chapter 15 (, &#x27;The English months&#x27;) of his 8th-century work (&quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;), Bede describes the indigenous month names of the English people. After describing the worship of the goddess Rheda during the Anglo-Saxon month of , Bede writes about , the month of the goddess Ēostre:

Before the discovery of the in 1958, scholarship on this topic frequently raised the question of whether Bede invented the deity.
In 1892, Charles J. Billson noted that scholars before his writing were divided about the existence of Bede&#x27;s account of Ēostre, stating that &quot;among authorities who have no doubt as to her existence are W. Grimm, Wackernagel, Sinrock , and Wolf. On the other hand, Weinhold rejects the idea on philological grounds, and so do Heinrich Leo and Hermann Oesre. Kuhn says, &#x27;The Anglo-Saxon Eostre looks like an invention of Bede;&#x27; and Mannhardt also dismisses her as an etymological .&quot; Billson wrote that &quot;the whole question turns[...] upon Bede&#x27;s credibility&quot;, and that &quot;one is inclined to agree with Grimm, that it would be uncritical to saddle this eminent Father of the Church, who keeps Heathendom at arms&#x27; length and tells us less of than he knows, with the invention of this goddess.&quot; Billson pointed out that the Christianization of England started at the end of the 6th century, and, by the 7th, was completed. Billson argued that, as Bede was born in 672, Bede must have had opportunities to learn the names of the native goddesses of the Anglo-Saxons, &quot;who were hardly extinct in his lifetime.&quot;

According to philologist Rudolf Simek in 1984, despite expressions of doubts, Bede&#x27;s account of Ēostre should not be disregarded. Simek opined that a &quot;spring-like fertility goddess&quot; must be assumed rather than a &quot;goddess of sunrise&quot; regardless of the name, reasoning that &quot;otherwise the Germanic goddesses (and matrons) are mostly connected with prosperity and growth&quot;. Simek pointed to a comparison with the goddess Rheda, also attested by Bede.

In 2011 Philip A. Shaw wrote that the subject has seen &quot;a lengthy history of arguments for and against Bede&#x27;s goddess Ēostre, with some scholars taking fairly extreme positions on either side&quot; and that some theories against the goddess have gained popular cultural prominence. Shaw noted that &quot;much of this debate, however, was conducted in ignorance of a key piece of evidence, as it was not discovered until 1958. This evidence is furnished by over 150 Romano-Germanic votive inscriptions to deities named the , found near Morken-Harff and datable to around 150–250 AD&quot;. Most of these inscriptions are in an incomplete state, yet most are complete enough for reasonable clarity of the inscriptions. As early as 1966 scholars have linked these names etymologically with Ēostre and an element found in Germanic personal names. Shaw argued against a functional interpretation of the available evidence and concluded that &quot;the etymological connections of her name suggests that her worshippers saw her geographical and social relationship with them as more central than any functions she may have had&quot;.

In a 2022 paper published in &quot;Folklore&quot;, scholar Richard Sermon rejects Shaw&#x27;s proposal that Ēostre was a localized goddess. Sermon takes particular issue with Shaw&#x27;s rejection of an association with the dawn:

==Reception==
===Jacob Grimm===
In his 1835 , philologist Jacob Grimm cites comparative evidence to reconstruct a potential continental Germanic goddess whose name would have been preserved in the Old High German name of Easter, *. Addressing skepticism towards goddesses mentioned by Bede, Grimm comments that &quot;there is nothing improbable in them, nay the first of them is justified by clear traces in the vocabularies of Germanic tribes.&quot; Specifically regarding Ēostre, Grimm continues that:

Grimm notes that &quot;all of the nations bordering on us have retained the Biblical ; even Ulphilas writes , not ( not ), though he must have known the word&quot;. Grimm details that the Old High German adverb &quot;expresses movement towards the rising sun&quot;, as did the Old Norse term , and potentially also Anglo-Saxon and Gothic (). Grimm compares these terms to the identical Latin term , and contends that the cult of the goddess may have been centred around an Old Norse form, , or that her cult may have already been extinct by the time of Christianization.

Grimm notes that the Old Norse &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book attests to a male being called , whom he describes as a &quot;spirit of light.&quot; Grimm comments that a female version would have been , yet that the High German and Saxon peoples seem to have only formed and , feminine, and not and , masculine. Grimm additionally speculates on the nature of the goddess and surviving folk customs that may have been associated with her in Germany:

In the second volume of , Grimm picked up the subject of Ostara again, speculating on possible connections between the goddess and various German Easter customs, including Easter eggs:

Grimm commented on further Easter time customs, including unique sword dances and particular baked goods (&quot;pastry of heathenish form&quot;). In addition, Grimm weighed a potential connection to the Slavic spring goddess and the Lithuanian .

According to anthropologist Krystal D&#x27;Costa, there is no evidence to connect the tradition of Easter eggs with Ostara. Eggs became a symbol in Christianity associated with rebirth as early as the 1st century CE, via the iconography of the Phoenix egg. D&#x27;Costa theorizes that eggs became associated with Easter specifically in medieval Europe, when eating them was prohibited during the fast of Lent. D&#x27;Costa highlights that a common practice in England at that time was for children to go door-to-door begging for eggs on the Saturday before Lent began. People handed out eggs as special treats for children prior to their fast.

===Connection to Easter Hares===
In Northern Europe, Easter imagery often involves hares and rabbits. The first scholar to make a connection between the goddess Eostre and hares was Adolf Holtzmann in his book . Holtzmann wrote of the tradition, &quot;the Easter Hare is inexplicable to me, but probably the hare was the sacred animal of Ostara; just as there is a hare on the statue of Abnoba.&quot; Citing folk Easter customs in Leicestershire, England, where &quot;the profits of the land called Harecrop Leys were applied to providing a meal which was thrown on the ground at the &#x27;Hare-pie Bank&#x27;&quot;, late 19th-century scholar Charles Isaac Elton speculated on a connection between these customs and the worship of Ēostre. In his late 19th-century study of the hare in folk custom and mythology, Charles J. Billson cited numerous incidents of folk customs involving hares around the Easter season in Northern Europe. Billson said that &quot;whether there was a goddess named Ēostre, or not, and whatever connection the hare may have had with the ritual of Saxon or British worship, there are good grounds for believing that the sacredness of this animal reaches back into an age still more remote, where it is probably a very important part of the great Spring Festival of the prehistoric inhabitants of this island.&quot;

Adolf Holtzmann had also speculated that &quot;the hare must once have been a bird, because it lays eggs&quot; in modern German folklore. From this statement, numerous later sources built a modern legend in which the goddess Eostre transformed a bird into an egg-laying hare. A response to a question about the origins of Easter hares in the 8 June 1889 issue of the journal &quot;American Notes and Queries&quot; stated: &quot;In Germany and among the Pennsylvania Germans toy rabbits or hares made of canton flannel stuffed with cotton are given as gifts on Easter morning. The children are told that this Osh’ter has laid the Easter eggs. This curious idea is thus explained: The hare was originally a bird, and was changed into a quadruped by the goddess Ostara; in gratitude to Ostara or Eastre, the hare exercises its original bird function to lay eggs for the goddess on her festal day.&quot; According to folklorist Stephen Winick, by 1900, many popular sources had picked up the story of Eostre and the hare. One described the story as one of the oldest in mythology, &quot;despite the fact that it was then less than twenty years old.&quot;

Some scholars have further linked customs and imagery involving hares to both Ēostre and the Norse goddess Freyja. Writing in 1972, John Andrew Boyle cited commentary contained within an etymology dictionary by A. Ernout and A. Meillet, where the authors write that &quot;Little else[...] is known about [Ēostre], but it has been suggested that her lights, as goddess of the dawn, were carried by hares. And she certainly represented spring fecundity, and love and carnal pleasure that leads to fecundity.&quot; Boyle responded that nothing is known about Ēostre outside of Bede&#x27;s single passage, that the authors had seemingly accepted the identification of Ēostre with the Norse goddess Freyja, yet that the hare is not associated with Freyja either. Boyle writes that &quot;her carriage, we are told by Snorri, was drawn by a pair of cats – animals, it is true, which like hares were the familiars of witches, with whom Freyja seems to have much in common.&quot; However, Boyle adds that &quot;on the other hand, when the authors speak of the hare as the &#x27;companion of Aphrodite and of satyrs and cupids&#x27; and point out that &#x27;in the Middle Ages it appears beside the figure of Luxuria&#x27;, they are on much surer ground and can adduce the evidence of their illustrations.&quot;

The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare () was recorded in south-west Germany in 1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in other parts of Germany until the 18th century. Scholar Richard Sermon writes that &quot;hares were frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition that hares laid eggs, since a hare&#x27;s scratch or form and a lapwing&#x27;s nest look very similar, and both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe. German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the Easter Bunny.&quot;

==In modern culture==

===Modern paganism===
A holiday named for the goddess is part of the neopagan Wiccan Wheel of the Year (Ostara, 21 March).

In some forms of modern Germanic paganism, Ēostre (or Ostara) is venerated. Regarding this veneration, Carole M. Cusack comments that, among adherents, Ēostre is &quot;associated with the coming of spring and the dawn, and her festival is celebrated at the spring equinox. Because she brings renewal, rebirth from the death of winter, some Heathens associate Ēostre with Iðunn, keeper of the apples of youth in Scandinavian mythology&quot;.

===Fiction===
In the first season of the TV series &quot;American Gods,&quot; based on the novel of the same name, Ostara is portrayed by Kristin Chenoweth. In the series, Ostara has survived into the modern age by forming an alliance with the Goddess of Media (Gillian Anderson) and capitalising on the Christian holiday. Odin (Ian McShane) forces her to accept that those who celebrate Easter are worshipping Jesus and not her, causing her to join his rebellion against the New Gods.

===Erroneous association with Ishtar===
In 1853, Scottish protestant minister Alexander Hislop published &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;, an anti-Catholic tract. In the tract, Hislop connects modern English &quot;Easter&quot; with the East Semitic theonym &quot;Ishtar&quot; by way of folk etymology. For example, from &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;, third edition:

Because Hislop&#x27;s claims have no linguistics foundation, his claims were rejected, but the &quot;Two Babylons&quot; would go on to have some influence in popular culture. In the 2000s, a popular Internet meme similarly claimed an incorrect linguistic connection between English &quot;Easter&quot; and &quot;Ishtar&quot;.

===Science and technology===
The name has been adopted for an asteroid (343 Ostara, 1892 by Max Wolf), In music, the name has been adopted as a name by the musical group Ostara, and as the names of albums by :zoviet*france: (&quot;Eostre&quot;, 1984) and The Wishing Tree (&quot;Ostara&quot;, 2009).

===Politics===
Politically, the name of Ostara was in the early 20th century invoked as the name of a German nationalist magazine, book series and publishing house established in 1905 at Mödling, Austria.

<text>Commutative algebra, first known as ideal theory, is the branch of algebra that studies commutative rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings. Both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra. Prominent examples of commutative rings include polynomial rings; rings of algebraic integers, including the ordinary integers formula_1; and &quot;p&quot;-adic integers.

Commutative algebra is the main technical tool of algebraic geometry, and many results and concepts of commutative algebra are strongly related with geometrical concepts.

The study of rings that are not necessarily commutative is known as noncommutative algebra; it includes ring theory, representation theory, and the theory of Banach algebras.

==Overview==
Commutative algebra is essentially the study of the rings occurring in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.

Several concepts of commutative algebras have been developed in relation with algebraic number theory, such as Dedekind rings (the main class of commutative rings occurring in algebraic number theory), integral extensions, and valuation rings.

Polynomial rings in several indeterminates over a field are examples of commutative rings. Since algebraic geometry is fundamentally the study of the common zeros of these rings, many results and concepts of algebraic geometry have counterparts in commutative algebra, and their names recall often their geometric origin; for example &quot;Krull dimension&quot;, &quot;localization of a ring&quot;, &quot;local ring&quot;, &quot;regular ring&quot;.

An affine algebraic variety corresponds to a prime ideal in a polynomial ring, and the points of such an affine variety correspond to the maximal ideals that contain this prime ideal. The Zariski topology, originally defined on an algebraic variety, has been extended to the sets of the prime ideals of any commutative ring; for this topology, the closed sets are the sets of prime ideals that contain a given ideal. 

The spectrum of a ring is a ringed space formed by the prime ideals equipped with the Zariski topology, and the localizations of the ring at the open sets of a basis of this topology. This is the starting point of scheme theory, a generalization of algebraic geometry introduced by Grothendieck, which is strongly based on commutative algebra, and has induced, in turns, many developments of commutative algebra.

== History ==
The subject, first known as ideal theory, began with Richard Dedekind&#x27;s work on ideals, itself based on the earlier work of Ernst Kummer and Leopold Kronecker. Later, David Hilbert introduced the term &quot;ring&quot; to generalize the earlier term &quot;number ring&quot;. Hilbert introduced a more abstract approach to replace the more concrete and computationally oriented methods grounded in such things as complex analysis and classical invariant theory. In turn, Hilbert strongly influenced Emmy Noether, who recast many earlier results in terms of an ascending chain condition, now known as the Noetherian condition. Another important milestone was the work of Hilbert&#x27;s student Emanuel Lasker, who introduced primary ideals and proved the first version of the Lasker–Noether theorem.

The main figure responsible for the birth of commutative algebra as a mature subject was Wolfgang Krull, who introduced the fundamental notions of localization and completion of a ring, as well as that of regular local rings. He established the concept of the Krull dimension of a ring, first for Noetherian rings before moving on to expand his theory to cover general valuation rings and Krull rings. To this day, Krull&#x27;s principal ideal theorem is widely considered the single most important foundational theorem in commutative algebra. These results paved the way for the introduction of commutative algebra into algebraic geometry, an idea which would revolutionize the latter subject.

Much of the modern development of commutative algebra emphasizes modules. Both ideals of a ring &quot;R&quot; and &quot;R&quot;-algebras are special cases of &quot;R&quot;-modules, so module theory encompasses both ideal theory and the theory of ring extensions. Though it was already incipient in Kronecker&#x27;s work, the modern approach to commutative algebra using module theory is usually credited to Krull and Noether.

==Main tools and results==

===Noetherian rings===

A Noetherian ring, named after Emmy Noether, is a ring in which every ideal is finitely generated; that is, all elements of any ideal can be written as a linear combinations of a finite set of elements, with coefficients in the ring. 

Many commonly considered commutative rings are Noetherian, in particular, every field, the ring of the integer, and every polynomial ring in one or several indeterminates over them. The fact that polynomial rings over a field are Noetherian is called Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem.

Moreover, many ring constructions preserve the Noetherian property. In particular, if a commutative ring is Noetherian, the same is true for every polynomial ring over it, and for every quotient ring, localization, or completion of the ring.

The importance of the Noetherian property lies in its ubiquity and also in the fact that many important theorems of commutative algebra require that the involved rings are Noetherian, This is the case, in particular of Lasker–Noether theorem, the Krull intersection theorem, and Nakayama&#x27;s lemma.

Furthermore, if a ring is Noetherian, then it satisfies the descending chain condition on prime ideals, which implies that every Noetherian local ring has a finite Krull dimension.

===Primary decomposition===

An ideal &quot;Q&quot; of a ring is said to be &quot;primary&quot; if &quot;Q&quot; is proper and whenever &quot;xy&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot;, either &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot; or &quot;yn&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot; for some positive integer &quot;n&quot;. In Z, the primary ideals are precisely the ideals of the form (&quot;pe&quot;) where &quot;p&quot; is prime and &quot;e&quot; is a positive integer. Thus, a primary decomposition of (&quot;n&quot;) corresponds to representing (&quot;n&quot;) as the intersection of finitely many primary ideals.

The &quot;Lasker–Noether theorem&quot;, given here, may be seen as a certain generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic:

For any primary decomposition of &quot;I&quot;, the set of all radicals, that is, the set {Rad(&quot;Q&quot;1), ..., Rad(&quot;Qt&quot;)} remains the same by the Lasker–Noether theorem. In fact, it turns out that (for a Noetherian ring) the set is precisely the assassinator of the module &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;; that is, the set of all annihilators of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot; (viewed as a module over &quot;R&quot;) that are prime.

===Localization===
The localization is a formal way to introduce the &quot;denominators&quot; to a given ring or a module. That is, it introduces a new ring/module out of an existing one so that it consists of fractions 
:formula_2.
where the denominators &quot;s&quot; range in a given subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;R&quot;. The archetypal example is the construction of the ring Q of rational numbers from the ring Z of integers.

===Completion===

A completion is any of several related functors on rings and modules that result in complete topological rings and modules. Completion is similar to localization, and together they are among the most basic tools in analysing commutative rings. Complete commutative rings have simpler structure than the general ones and Hensel&#x27;s lemma applies to them.

===Zariski topology on prime ideals===

The Zariski topology defines a topology on the spectrum of a ring (the set of prime ideals). In this formulation, the Zariski-closed sets are taken to be the sets

:formula_3

where &quot;A&quot; is a fixed commutative ring and &quot;I&quot; is an ideal. This is defined in analogy with the classical Zariski topology, where closed sets in affine space are those defined by polynomial equations . To see the connection with the classical picture, note that for any set &quot;S&quot; of polynomials (over an algebraically closed field), it follows from Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz that the points of &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) (in the old sense) are exactly the tuples (&quot;a1&quot;, ..., &quot;an&quot;) such that the ideal (&quot;x1&quot; - &quot;a1&quot;, ..., &quot;xn&quot; - &quot;an&quot;) contains &quot;S&quot;; moreover, these are maximal ideals and by the &quot;weak&quot; Nullstellensatz, an ideal of any affine coordinate ring is maximal if and only if it is of this form. Thus, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is &quot;the same as&quot; the maximal ideals containing &quot;S&quot;. Grothendieck&#x27;s innovation in defining Spec was to replace maximal ideals with all prime ideals; in this formulation it is natural to simply generalize this observation to the definition of a closed set in the spectrum of a ring.

==Connections with algebraic geometry==
Commutative algebra (in the form of polynomial rings and their quotients, used in the definition of algebraic varieties) has always been a part of algebraic geometry. However, in the late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s concept of a scheme. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra, which are locally ringed spaces, which form a category that is antiequivalent (dual) to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field &quot;k&quot;, and the category of finitely generated reduced &quot;k&quot;-algebras. The gluing is along the Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set-theoretic sense is then replaced by a Zariski topology in the sense of Grothendieck topology. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the étale topology, and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc. Nowadays some other examples have become prominent, including the Nisnevich topology. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions, leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, Deligne–Mumford stacks, both often called algebraic stacks.

<doc id="245992" wikidata="Q456673" url="?curid=245992" title="Charity (Christian virtue)">
<text>In Christian theology, charity (Latin: ) is considered one of the seven virtues and was understood by Thomas Aquinas as &quot;the friendship of man for God&quot;, which &quot;unites us to God&quot;. He holds it as &quot;the most excellent of the virtues&quot;. Aquinas further holds that &quot;the habit of charity extends not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor&quot;.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines &quot;charity&quot; as &quot;the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for His own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God&quot;.
==: the altruistic love==
The phrase from —or () in the original Greek is translated in the King James Version as: &quot;God is love&quot;, and in the Douay-Rheims bible as: &quot;God is charity&quot; (). Thomas Aquinas does not simply equate charity with &quot;love&quot;, which he holds as a passion, not a virtue. The King James Version uses both the words &quot;charity&quot; and &quot;love&quot; to translate the idea of / (): sometimes it uses one, then sometimes the other, for the same concept. Most other English translations, both before and since, do not; instead, throughout they use the same more direct English word &quot;love&quot;. Love can have other meanings in English, but as used in the New Testament it almost always refers to the virtue of .

Many times when charity is mentioned in English-language bibles, it refers to &quot;love of God&quot;, which is a spiritual love that is extended from God to man and then reflected by man, who is made in the image of God, back to God. God gives man the power to act as God acts (God is love), man then reflects God&#x27;s power in his own human actions towards others. One example of this movement is &quot;charity shall cover the multitude of sins&quot; (). &quot;The practice of charity brings us to act toward ourselves and others out of love alone, precisely because each person has the dignity of a beloved child of God.&quot;

==As a theological virtue==
Charity is held to be the ultimate perfection of the human spirit because it both glorifies and reflects the nature of God. Confusion can arise from the multiple meanings of the English word &quot;love&quot;. As with other theological virtues, charity is divinely infused into the soul; it resides in the &quot;will&quot;. According to Aquinas, charity is an absolute requirement for happiness, which he holds as man&#x27;s last goal.

Charity has two parts: love of God and love of man, which includes both love of one&#x27;s neighbor and one&#x27;s self.

In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul places the greatest emphasis on charity (love). &quot;So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.&quot; He describes it this way:

The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy.

In December 2005, Pope Benedict XVI issued the encyclical &quot;Deus caritas est&quot;, in which he discussed &quot;... the love which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others.&quot;

Based on the &#x27;s Parable of The Sheep and the Goats, the early Church saw the love of the poor () as the crown jewel of the virtues. Cappadocian father St. Gregory of Nazianzus wrote that

After considering many of the Christian virtues, he concludes that

<doc id="246003" wikidata="Q3357712" url="?curid=246003" title="Otso">
<text>In Finnish mythology, Otso (also known as Karhu, Ohto, Kontio, Metsän kuningas, and Mesikämmen) is a bear, the sacred king of animals and leader of the forest. It was deeply feared and respected by old Finnish tribes. Otso appears in the Finnish national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Due to the importance of the bear spirit in historical Finnish paganism, bears are still considered by many Finns to be kings of the forest, and the bear is even the national animal of Finland.

Otso is not a particular individual bear spirit, but rather the collective animistic spirit of all bears. Besides being worshipped by historical Finnish pagans, Otso is also worshipped in modern Finnish neopaganism, and the neopagan organization Karhun kansa is named after the bear.

== Mythology ==
The story of how Otso was born varies in myths. Some stories tell of how Ukko, the god of weather, threw wool into the sea and how Otso was born from the bits of wool that reached the shore. Other stories tell of how Otso was born from the Ursa Major constellation.

The most ancient myths surrounding Otso tell of the marriage between Otso and the primordial mother of all men. This relationship was reflected in the ritual of Peijaiset, in which the bear spirit was symbolically returned to its family through marriage.

Otso had many wives and children, but it was also said to eat them.

== Peijaiset ==
If a bear had to be killed by ancient Finns, a sacred ritual of Peijaiset was held. In it, the bear&#x27;s skull was mounted on a pine tree. The bear was skinned in the forest after which the meat and the hide were taken to the village. Ale was brewed and the meat of the bear was eaten as a sacred meal. A girl and a boy were then elected as the symbolic wedding couple. During the feast, the skull of the bear was carried on a plate to the room. The plate was given a place of honor at head of the long table. The bride and bridegroom sat at the opposite end. 

The skull of the bear was then carried to a sacred tall pine and fixed high on a branch among other bear skulls. At this point there followed a chant as a dialogue between the killed bear and the primordial mother of the bear who was called Hongotar.

The bones of the bear were then buried under the pine. One important function of this rite was to prevent the skull from decomposing. The skull of the bear was a holy object and to destroy it was taboo. The idea of this conservation was to make it possible for the spirit of the bear to return to earth to reincarnate and be killed again.

<doc id="246004" wikidata="Q8863" url="?curid=246004" title="Klaus Wowereit">
<text>Klaus Wowereit (born 1 October 1953) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and was the Governing Mayor of Berlin from 21 October 2001 to 11 December 2014. In 2001 state elections his party won a plurality of the votes, 29.7%. He served as President of the Bundesrat (the fourth highest office in Germany) in 2001/02. His SPD-led coalition was re-elected in the 2006 elections; after the 2011 elections the SPD&#x27;s coalition partner changed from the Left to the Christian Democratic Union. He was also sometimes mentioned as a possible SPD candidate for the Chancellorship of Germany (&quot;Kanzlerkandidatur&quot;), but that never materialized.

== Early life==
Wowereit was born in West Berlin. Until 1973, Wowereit attended the Ulrich-von-Hutten-Oberschule in Berlin-Lichtenrade. Afterwards, he studied law at the Free University Berlin (State Exams, 1981 and 1984).

== Political career ==
After three years as a civil servant in the Senate office of the Interior, Wowereit stood for election as municipal councillor in the Tempelhof district. At the age of 30, he was, therefore, the youngest councilor in the city of Berlin. After eleven years as a District Councillor he stood for the Berlin House of Representatives (Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin) which serves as the City&#x27;s State Parliament in 1995. In December 1999, he was elected chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in the Abgeordnetenhaus.

===Mayor of Berlin, 2001–2014===
Wowereit took office as Governing Mayor of Berlin (&quot;) in June 2001. Previously, the SPD had left the grand coalition with the CDU and initiated new elections. After this election and following long-time negotiations, Wowereit finally started a coalition with the PDS.

In 2003, Wowereit declared that &quot;Berlin ist arm, aber sexy&quot;&quot; (&quot;Berlin is poor, but sexy&quot;), a description that reflected on the one hand the city&#x27;s working class history and on-going financial woes, and on the other its cultural vibrancy, aided by a relatively low cost of living for a major European capital. The phrase helped to market the city to the rest of the world, and it drew in tourists, as well as attracting artists, writers, musicians and subsequently technology entrepreneurs. However, concern about gentrification and increasingly expensive rents is often expressed by seasoned Berliners and new-comers alike.

In the elections held on 17 September 2006, Wowereit&#x27;s SPD finished as the strongest party with a plurality of 30.8%. A coalition with Die Linke was continued. However the 16th Abgeordnetenhaus re-elected Wowereit as Governing Mayor on 23 November 2006, in the second ballot with only a 75:74 majority. CDU, Free Democrats and the Green Party voted against him. In the elections held on 18 September 2011 he and his party were again the strongest party.

Public attitude in Germany on the topic of migration has a long history of controversy. A regular German poll by the opinion polling agency Ipsos indicates that the number of immigrants in Germany, as well as the proportion of Muslim immigrants among Germany&#x27;s migrant population is vastly overestimated by those polled, so too in 2019. Recent statistics of the German Buro of Statistics reported 21.9 million people with a &quot;migration background&quot; (citizens and non-citizens) in Germany, 2020. Of those, in the same year, according to the statistics agency Statista, 5.5 million were Muslim. The publication of former Berlin state Minister of Finance Thilo Sarrazin&#x27;s 2010 polemic &quot;Germany Abolishes Itself&quot; fell in Klaus Wowereit&#x27;s tenure as governing mayor of Berlin. This prompted heated debates throughout the German-speaking countries. In response, in 2011, Mayor Wowereit published &quot;Mut zur Integration – für ein neues Miteinander&quot; (&quot;Courage for integration – for a new together&quot;). That same year, he appointed Turkish-origin politician Dilek Kolat Senator for Labour, Integration and Women. In May 2012, Wowereit named Şermin Langhoff artistic director of the Maxim Gorki Theater.

In the negotiations to form a &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; of Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian CSU) and the SPD following the 2013 federal elections, Wowereit led the SPD delegation in the working group on cultural and media affairs; his counterpart of the CDU was Michael Kretschmer.

On 26 August 2014 Wowereit announced that he would resign his position as of 11 December 2014. At the time of his resignation, he was the longest-serving head of a German state.

==== Resignation and Berlin-Brandenburg Airport debacle ====
On 21 October 2003 Wowereit became one of four members representing the &quot;Land&quot; of Berlin in the supervisory board of the project to build the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport. In 2006, he was elected chairman of the board. However, on 7 January 2013, Wowereit relinquished his chairmanship after the continuing delay of the airport&#x27;s opening date. The prime minister of the &quot;Land&quot; of Brandenburg, Matthias Platzeck was appointed as his successor. Wowereit survived a vote of no confidence brought against him in the Berlin House of Representatives on 12 January. When Platzeck gave up his political offices for health reasons in July 2013, Wowereit was eventually appointed chairman again, despite much criticism. Critics have accused Wowereit of being responsible for the various delays and cost overruns of the airport project. He has been accused of being blind to looming problems, and reacting angrily to unfavorable reports. Also, he is said to have filled the board with political friends rather than professionals.

Wowereit announced his intention to resign at the end of 2014 due to the airport delays saying it was the &quot;biggest failure&quot; of his term in office, but that there were also other &quot;several difficult times here.&quot;

==Life after politics==
Alongside Jutta Allmendinger, Wowereit co-chaired an independent expert commission on gender-based discrimination at Germany&#x27;s Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency from 2015 until 2016. In 2017, he briefly arbitrated wage negotiations between Eurowings and UFO, a flight attendant trade union.

== Personal life ==
Wowereit is the youngest child in his family, with two other brothers and two sisters, who grew up without a father. One of his brothers supported his studies and later he took care of his brother, who was paralyzed after an accident, as well as his mother, who was suffering from cancer.

Wowereit is one of the most famous German politicians who is openly gay. In coming out, prior to the 2001 mayoral elections, he coined the now famous German phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m gay, and that&#x27;s a good thing.&quot;) In his autobiography, Wowereit states that his decision to come out in public was made because after his nomination as candidate to become the Mayor of Berlin, he felt that the German tabloids were already &quot;on the right track&quot;. With his coming out, Wowereit wanted to beat the tabloids to it and prevent them from writing wild, sensational and fabricated stories about his private life. Wowereit said those now famous words during a convention of the Berlin SPD. After the end of his speech, there was half a second of surprised silence, then spontaneous cheering and loud applause to support him.

In a 2010 interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, he said that coming out may actually have strengthened his campaign.

His election as mayor made Berlin one of three major European cities with an openly gay mayor, along with Paris, whose mayor was Bertrand Delanoë, and Hamburg, whose mayor was Ole von Beust at that time, who both also took office in 2001. However, von Beust resigned in 2010 and Delanoë left office in 2014, making Wowereit the only gay mayor of a major European city or of a major German city. Berlin being the largest and Hamburg being the second largest city in Germany, they are also German states in their own right, having made both Wowereit and von Beust also state premiers.

In September 2007, Wowereit published an autobiographical book titled &quot;&quot;, after his famous coming-out phrase ().

Wowereit&#x27;s civil partner, Jörn Kubicki, was a neurosurgeon. They were in a relationship from 1993 to March 2020 when Kubicki died as a result of a COVID-19 infection.

<text>3D films are motion pictures made to give an illusion of three-dimensional solidity, usually with the help of special glasses worn by viewers. They have existed in some form since 1915, but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3D film, and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business. Nonetheless, 3D films were prominently featured in the 1950s in American cinema, and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by IMAX high-end theaters and Disney-themed venues. 3D films became increasingly successful throughout the 2000s, peaking with the success of 3D presentations of &quot;Avatar&quot; in December 2009, after which 3D films again decreased in popularity. Certain directors have also taken more experimental approaches to 3D filmmaking, most notably celebrated auteur Jean-Luc Godard in his film &quot;Goodbye to Language&quot;.

==History==
===Before film===
The basic components of 3D film were introduced separately between 1833 and 1839. Stroboscopic animation was developed by Joseph Plateau in 1832 and published in 1833 in the form of a stroboscopic disc, which he later called the fantascope and became better known as the phénakisticope. Around the very same time (1832/1833), Charles Wheatstone developed the stereoscope, but he did not really make it public before June 1838. The first practical forms of photography were introduced in January 1839 by Louis Daguerre and Henry Fox Talbot. A combination of these elements into animated stereoscopic photography may have been conceived early on, but for decades it did not become possible to capture motion in real-time photographic recordings due to the long exposure times necessary for the light-sensitive emulsions that were used.

Charles Wheatstone got inventor Henry Fox Talbot to produce some calotype pairs for the stereoscope and received the first results in October 1840. Only a few more experimental stereoscopic photographs were made before David Brewster introduced his stereoscope with lenses in 1849. Wheatstone also approached Joseph Plateau with the suggestion to combine the stereoscope with the fantascope. In 1849, Plateau published about this concept in an article about several improvements made to his fantascope and suggested a stop motion technique that would involve a series of photographs of purpose-made plaster statuettes in different poses. The idea reached Jules Duboscq, an instrument maker who already marketed Plateau&#x27;s Fantascope as well as the stereoscopes of Wheatstone and Brewster. In November 1852, Duboscq added the concept of his &quot;Stéréoscope-fantascope, ou Bïoscope&quot; to his stereoscope patent. Production of images proved very difficult, since the photographic sequence had to be carefully constructed from separate still images. The bioscope was no success and the only extant disc, without apparatus, is found in the Joseph Plateau collection of the University of Ghent. The disc contains 12 albumen image pairs of a machine in motion.

Most of the other early attempts to create motion pictures also aimed to include the stereoscopic effect.

In November 1851, Antoine Claudet claimed to have created a stereoscope that showed people in motion. The device initially only showed two phases, but during the next two years, Claudet worked on a camera that would record stereoscopic pairs for four different poses (patented in 1853). Claudet found that the stereoscopic effect did not work properly in this device, but believed the illusion of motion was successful.

In 1855, Johann Nepomuk Czermak published an article about his Stereophoroskop. His first idea to create 3D animation involved sticking pins in a stroboscopic disc to create a sequence that would show one pin moving further into the cardboard and back. He also designed a device that would feed the image pairs from two stroboscopic discs into one lenticular stereoscope and a vertical predecessor of the zoetrope.

On February 27, 1860, Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices. This included a version that used an endless band of pictures running between two spools that was intermittently lit by an electric spark. Desvignes&#x27; &quot;Mimoscope&quot;, received an Honourable Mention &quot;for ingenuity of construction&quot; at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. It could &quot;exhibit drawings, models, single or stereoscopic photographs, so as to animate animal movements, or that of machinery, showing various other illusions.&quot; Desvignes &quot;employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success.&quot; The horizontal slits (like in Czermak&#x27;s Stereophoroskop) allowed a much improved view, with both eyes, of the opposite pictures.

In 1861, American engineer Coleman Sellers II received US patent No. 35,317 for the kinematoscope, a device that exhibited &quot;stereoscopic pictures as to make them represent objects in motion&quot;. In his application he stated: &quot;This has frequently been done with plane pictures but
has never been, with stereoscopic pictures&quot;. He used three sets of stereoscopic photographs in a sequence with some duplicates to regulate the flow of a simple repetitive motion, but also described a system for very large series of pictures of complicated motion.

On August 11, 1877, the &quot;Daily Alta&quot; newspaper announced a project by Eadward Muybridge and Leland Stanford to produce sequences of photographs of a running horse with 12 stereoscopic cameras. Muybridge had much experience with stereo photography and had already made instantaneous pictures of Stanford&#x27;s horse Occident running at full speed. He eventually managed to shoot the proposed sequences of running horses in June 1878, with stereoscopic cameras. The published result and animated versions for his zoopraxiscope were not stereoscopic, but in 1898 Muybridge claimed that he had (privately) viewed the pictures in two synchronized zoetropes with Wheatstone&#x27;s reflecting stereoscope as a &quot;very satisfactory reproduction of an apparently solid miniature horse trotting, and of another galloping&quot;.

Thomas Edison demonstrated his phonograph on November 29, 1877, after previous announcements of the device for recording and replaying sound had been published earlier in the year. An article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; concluded: &quot;It is already possible, by ingenious optical contrivances, to throw stereoscopic photographs of people on screens in full view of an audience. Add the talking phonograph to counterfeit their voices and it would be difficult to carry the illusion of real presence much further&quot;. Wordsworth Donisthorpe announced in the January 24, 1878, edition of &quot;Nature&quot; that he would advance that conception: &quot;By combining the phonograph with the kinesigraph I will undertake not only to produce a talking picture of Mr. Gladstone which, with motionless lips and unchanged expression shall positively recite his latest anti-Turkish speech in his own voice and tone. Not only this, but the life size photograph itself shall move and gesticulate precisely as he did when making the speech, the words and gestures corresponding as in real life.&quot; Dr. Phipson, a correspondent for British news in a French photography magazine, relayed the concept, but renamed the device &quot;Kinétiscope&quot; to reflect the viewing purpose rather than the recording option. This was picked up in the United States and discussed in an interview with Edison later in the year. Neither Donisthorpe&#x27;s or Edison&#x27;s later moving picture results were stereoscopic.

===Early patents and tests===
In the late 1890s, British film pioneer William Friese-Greene filed a patent for a 3D film process. In his patent, two films were projected side by side on screen. The viewer looked through a stereoscope to converge the two images. Because of the obtrusive mechanics behind this method, theatrical use was not practical.

Frederic Eugene Ives patented his stereo camera rig in 1900. The camera had two lenses coupled together inches (4.45 centimeters) apart.

On June 10, 1915, Edwin S. Porter and William E. Waddell presented tests to an audience at the Astor Theater in New York City. In red-green anaglyph, the audience was presented three reels of tests, which included rural scenes, test shots of Marie Doro, a segment of John Mason playing a number of passages from &quot;Jim the Penman&quot; (a film released by Famous Players–Lasky that year, but not in 3D), Oriental dancers, and a reel of footage of Niagara Falls. However, according to Adolph Zukor in his 1953 autobiography &quot;The Public Is Never Wrong: My 50 Years in the Motion Picture Industry&quot;, nothing was produced in this process after these tests.

===1909–1915: Alabastra and Kinoplastikon===
By 1909, the German film market suffered much from overproduction and too much competition. German film tycoon Oskar Messter had initially gained much financial success with the Tonbild synchronized sound films of his Biophon system since 1903, but the films were losing money by the end of the decade and Messter would stop Tonbild production in 1913. Producers and exhibitors were looking into new film attractions and invested for instance in colorful imagery. The development of stereoscopic cinema seemed a logical step to lure visitors back into the movie theatres.

In 1909, German civil engineer August Engelsmann patented a process that projected filmed performances within a physical decor on an actual stage. Soon after, Messter obtained patents for a very similar process, probably by agreement with Engelsmann, and started marketing it as &quot;Alabastra&quot;. Performers were brightly dressed and brightly lit while filmed against a black background, mostly miming their singing or musical skills or dancing to the circa four-minute pre-recorded phonographs. The film recordings would be projected from below, to appear as circa 30 inch figures on a glass pane in front of a small stage, in a setup very similar to the Pepper&#x27;s ghost illusion that offered a popular stage trick technique since the 1860s. The glass pane was not visible to the audience and the projected figures seemed able to move around freely across the stage in their virtual tangible and lifelike appearance. The brightness of the figures was necessary to avoid see-through spots and made them resemble alabaster sculptures. To adapt to this appearance, several films featured Pierrot or other white clowns, while some films were probably hand-coloured. Although Alabastra was well received by the press, Messter produced few titles, hardly promoted them and abandoned it altogether a few years later. He believed the system to be uneconomical due to its need for special theatres instead of the widely available movie screens, and he did not like that it seemed only suitable for stage productions and not for &quot;natural&quot; films. Nonetheless, there were numerous imitators in Germany and Messter and Engelsmann still teamed with American swindler Frank J. Goldsoll set up a short-lived variant named &quot;Fantomo&quot; in 1914.

Rather in agreement with Messter or not, Karl Juhasz and Franz Haushofer opened a Kinoplastikon theatre in Vienna in 1911. Their patented system was very similar to Alabaster, but projected life-size figures from the wings of the stage. With much higher ticket prices than standard cinema, it was targeted at middle-class audiences to fill the gap between low-brow films and high-class theatre. Audiences reacted enthusiastically and by 1913 there reportedly were 250 theatres outside Austria, in France, Italy, United Kingdom, Russia and North America. However, the first Kinoplastikon in Paris started in January 1914 and the premiere in New York took place in the Hippodrome in March 1915. In 1913, Walter R. Booth directed 10 films for the U.K. Kinoplastikon, presumably in collaboration with Cecil Hepworth. Theodore Brown, the licensee in the U.K. also patented a variant with front and back projection and reflected decor, and Goldsoll applied for a very similar patent only 10 days later. Further development and exploitation was probably haltered by World War I.

Alabastra and Kinoplastikon were often advertised as stereoscopic and screenless. Although in reality the effect was heavily dependent on glass screen projection and the films were not stereoscopic, the shows seemed truly three-dimensional as the figures were clearly separate from the background and virtually appeared inside the real, three-dimensional stage area without any visible screen.

Eventually, longer (multi-reel) films with story arcs proved to be the way out of the crisis in the movie market and supplanted the previously popular short films that mostly aimed to amuse people with tricks, gags or other brief variety and novelty attractions. Sound film, stereoscopic film and other novel techniques were relatively cumbersome to combine with multiple reels and were abandoned for a while.

===Early systems of stereoscopic filmmaking (pre-1952)===

The earliest confirmed 3D film shown to an out-of-house audience was &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, which premiered at the Ambassador Hotel Theater in Los Angeles on September 27, 1922. The camera rig was a product of the film&#x27;s producer, Harry K. Fairall, and cinematographer Robert F. Elder. It was filmed dual-strip in black and white, and single strip color anaglyphic release prints were produced using a color film invented and patented by Harry K. Fairall. A single projector could be used to display the movie but anaglyph glasses were used for viewing. The camera system and special color release print film all received U.S Patent No. 1,784,515 on December 9, 1930. After a preview for exhibitors and press in New York City, the film dropped out of sight, apparently not booked by exhibitors, and is now considered lost.

Early in December 1922, William Van Doren Kelley, inventor of the Prizma color system, cashed in on the growing interest in 3D films started by Fairall&#x27;s demonstration and shot footage with a camera system of his own design. Kelley then struck a deal with Samuel &quot;Roxy&quot; Rothafel to premiere the first in his series of &quot;Plasticon&quot; shorts entitled &quot;Movies of the Future&quot; at the Rivoli Theater in New York City.

Also in December 1922, Laurens Hammond (later inventor of the Hammond organ) premiered his Teleview system, which had been shown to the trade and press in October. Teleview was the first alternating-frame 3D system seen by the public. Using left-eye and right-eye prints and two interlocked projectors, left and right frames were alternately projected, each pair being shown three times to suppress flicker. Viewing devices attached to the armrests of the theater seats had rotary shutters that operated synchronously with the projector shutters, producing a clean and clear stereoscopic result. The only theater known to have installed Teleview was the Selwyn Theater in New York City, and only one show was ever presented with it: a group of short films, an exhibition of live 3D shadows, and &quot;M.A.R.S.&quot;, the only Teleview feature. The show ran for several weeks, apparently doing good business as a novelty (&quot;M.A.R.S.&quot; itself got poor reviews), but Teleview was never seen again.

In 1922, Frederic Eugene Ives and Jacob Leventhal began releasing their first stereoscopic shorts made over a three-year period. The first film, entitled &quot;Plastigrams&quot;, was distributed nationally by Educational Pictures in the red-and-blue anaglyph format. Ives and Leventhal then went on to produce the following stereoscopic shorts in the &quot;Stereoscopiks Series&quot; released by Pathé Films in 1925: &quot;Zowie&quot; (April 10), &quot;Luna-cy!&quot; (May 18), &quot;The Run-Away Taxi&quot; (December 17) and &quot;Ouch&quot; (December 17). On September 22, 1924, &quot;Luna-cy!&quot; was re-released in the De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film system.

The late 1920s to early 1930s saw little interest in stereoscopic pictures. In Paris, Louis Lumiere shot footage with his stereoscopic camera in September 1933. The following March he exhibited a remake of his 1895 short film &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée du Train&quot;, this time in anaglyphic 3D, at a meeting of the French Academy of Science.

In 1936, Leventhal and John Norling were hired based on their test footage to film MGM&#x27;s &quot;Audioscopiks&quot; series. The prints were by Technicolor in the red-and-green anaglyph format, and were narrated by Pete Smith. The first film, &quot;Audioscopiks&quot;, premiered January 11, 1936, and &quot;The New Audioscopiks&quot; premiered January 15, 1938. &quot;Audioscopiks&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award in the category Best Short Subject, Novelty in 1936.

With the success of the two Audioscopiks films, MGM produced one more short in anaglyph 3D, another Pete Smith Specialty called &quot;Third Dimensional Murder&quot; (1941). Unlike its predecessors, this short was shot with a studio-built camera rig. Prints were by Technicolor in red-and-blue anaglyph. The short is notable for being one of the few live-action appearances of the Frankenstein Monster as conceived by Jack Pierce for Universal Studios outside of their company.

While many of these films were printed by color systems, none of them was actually in color, and the use of the color printing was only to achieve an anaglyph effect.

====Introduction of Polaroid====

While attending Harvard University, Edwin H. Land conceived the idea of reducing glare by polarizing light. He took a leave of absence from Harvard to set up a lab and by 1929 had invented and patented a polarizing sheet. In 1932, he introduced Polaroid J Sheet as a commercial product. While his original intention was to create a filter for reducing glare from car headlights, Land did not underestimate the utility of his newly dubbed Polaroid filters in stereoscopic presentations.

In February 1936, Land gave the first public demonstration of Polaroid filters in conjunction with 3D photography at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The reaction was enthusiastic, and he followed it up with an installation at the New York Museum of Science. It is unknown what film was run for audiences at this exhibition.

Using Polaroid filters meant an entirely new form of projection, however. Two prints, each carrying either the right or left eye view, had to be synced up in projection using an external selsyn motor. Furthermore, polarized light would be largely depolarized by a matte white screen, and only a silver screen or screen made of other reflective material would correctly reflect the separate images.

Later that year, the feature, &quot;Nozze Vagabonde&quot; appeared in Italy, followed in Germany by &quot;Zum Greifen nah&quot; (&quot;You Can Nearly Touch It&quot;), and again in 1939 with Germany&#x27;s &quot;Sechs Mädel rollen ins Wochenend&quot; (&quot;Six Girls Drive Into the Weekend&quot;). The Italian film was made with the Gualtierotti camera; the two German productions with the Zeiss camera and the Vierling shooting system. All of these films were the first exhibited using Polaroid filters. The Zeiss Company in Germany manufactured glasses on a commercial basis commencing in 1936; they were also independently made around the same time in Germany by E. Käsemann and by J. Mahler.

In 1939, John Norling shot &quot;In Tune With Tomorrow&quot;, the first commercial 3D film using Polaroid in the US. This short premiered at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and was created specifically for the Chrysler Motors Pavilion. In it, a full 1939 Chrysler Plymouth is magically put together, set to music. Originally in black and white, the film was so popular that it was re-shot in color for the following year at the fair, under the title &quot;New Dimensions&quot;. In 1953, it was reissued by RKO as &quot;Motor Rhythm&quot;.

Another early short that utilized the Polaroid 3D process was 1940&#x27;s &quot;Magic Movies: Thrills For You&quot; produced by the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. for the Golden Gate International Exposition. Produced by John Norling, it was filmed by Jacob Leventhal using his own rig. It consisted of shots of various views that could be seen from the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s trains.

In the 1940s, World War II prioritized military applications of stereoscopic photography and it once again went on the back burner in most producers&#x27; minds.

===The &quot;golden era&quot; (1952–1954)===

What aficionados consider the &quot;golden era&quot; of 3D began in late 1952 with the release of the first color stereoscopic feature, &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, produced, written and directed by Arch Oboler. The film was shot in &quot;Natural Vision&quot;, a process that was co-created and controlled by M. L. Gunzberg. Gunzberg, who built the rig with his brother Julian, Friend Baker and Lothrop Worth, shopped it without success to various studios before Oboler used it for this feature, which went into production with the title, &quot;The Lions of Gulu&quot;. The critically panned film was nevertheless highly successful with audiences due to the novelty of 3D, which increased Hollywood interest in 3D during a period that had seen declining box-office admissions.

As with practically all of the features made during this boom, &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; was projected dual-strip, with Polaroid filters. During the 1950s, the familiar disposable anaglyph glasses made of cardboard were mainly used for comic books, two shorts by exploitation specialist Dan Sonney, and three shorts produced by Lippert Productions. However, even the Lippert shorts were available in the dual-strip format alternatively.

Because the features utilized two projectors, the capacity limit of film being loaded onto each projector (about , or an hour&#x27;s worth of film) meant that an intermission was necessary for every feature-length film. Quite often, intermission points were written into the script at a major plot point.

During Christmas of 1952, producer Sol Lesser quickly premiered the dual-strip showcase called &quot;Stereo Techniques&quot; in Chicago. Lesser acquired the rights to five dual-strip shorts. Two of them, &quot;Now is the Time (to Put On Your Glasses)&quot; and &quot;Around is Around&quot;, were directed by Norman McLaren in 1951 for the National Film Board of Canada. The other three films were produced in Britain for The Festival of Britain in 1951 by Raymond Spottiswoode. These were &quot;A Solid Explanation&quot;, &quot;Royal River&quot;, and &quot;The Black Swan&quot;.

James Mage was also an early pioneer in the 3D craze. Using his 16 mm 3D Bolex system, he premiered his &quot;Triorama&quot; program on February 10, 1953, with his four shorts: &quot;Sunday In Stereo&quot;, &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, &quot;American Life&quot;, and &quot;This is Bolex Stereo&quot;. This show is considered lost.

Another early 3D film during the boom was the Lippert Productions short &quot;A Day in the Country&quot;, narrated by Joe Besser, which was composed mostly of test footage. Unlike all of the other Lippert shorts, which were available in both dual-strip and anaglyph, this production was released in anaglyph only.

April 1953 saw two groundbreaking features in 3D: Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Dark&quot; and Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;House of Wax&quot;, the first 3D feature with stereophonic sound. &quot;House of Wax&quot; was (outside of Cinerama) the first time many American audiences heard recorded stereophonic sound; it was also the film that typecast Vincent Price as a horror star as well as the &quot;King of 3-D&quot; after he became the actor to star in the most 3D features (the others were &quot;The Mad Magician&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Mission&quot;, and &quot;Son of Sinbad&quot;). The success of these two films proved that major studios now had a method of getting filmgoers back into theaters and away from television sets, which were causing a steady decline in attendance.

Universal-International released its first 3D feature, &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;, on May 27, 1953, with stereophonic sound. That was followed by Paramount&#x27;s first 3D feature, &quot;Sangaree&quot; with Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl.

The Walt Disney Studios entered 3D with its May 28, 1953, release of &quot;Melody&quot;, which accompanied the first 3D western, Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Fort Ti&quot; at its Los Angeles opening. It was later shown at Disneyland&#x27;s Fantasyland Theater in 1957 as part of a program with Disney&#x27;s other short &quot;Working for Peanuts&quot;, entitled, &quot;3-D Jamboree&quot;. The show was hosted by the Mousketeers and was in color.

Columbia released several 3D westerns produced by Sam Katzman and directed by William Castle. Castle would later specialize in various technical in-theater gimmicks for such Columbia and Allied Artists features as &quot;13 Ghosts&quot;, &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, and &quot;The Tingler&quot;. Columbia also produced the only slapstick comedies conceived for 3D. The Three Stooges starred in &quot;Spooks&quot; and &quot;Pardon My Backfire&quot;; dialect comic Harry Mimmo starred in &quot;Down the Hatch&quot;. Producer Jules White was optimistic about the possibilities of 3D as applied to slapstick (with pies and other projectiles aimed at the audience), but only two of his stereoscopic shorts were shown in 3D. &quot;Down the Hatch&quot; was released as a conventional, &quot;flat&quot; motion picture. (Columbia has since printed &quot;Down the Hatch&quot; in 3D for film festivals.)

John Ireland, Joanne Dru and Macdonald Carey starred in the Jack Broder color production &quot;Hannah Lee&quot;, which premiered on June 19, 1953. The film was directed by Ireland, who sued Broder for his salary. Broder counter-sued, claiming that Ireland went over production costs with the film.

Another famous entry in the golden era of 3D was the 3 Dimensional Pictures production of &quot;Robot Monster&quot;. The film was allegedly scribed in an hour by screenwriter Wyott Ordung and filmed in a period of two weeks on a shoestring budget. Despite these shortcomings and the fact that the crew had no previous experience with the newly built camera rig, luck was on the cinematographer&#x27;s side, as many find the 3D photography in the film is well shot and aligned. &quot;Robot Monster&quot; also has a notable score by then up-and-coming composer Elmer Bernstein. The film was released June 24, 1953, and went out with the short &quot;Stardust in Your Eyes&quot;, which starred nightclub comedian, Slick Slavin.

20th Century Fox produced its only 3D feature, &quot;Inferno&quot;, in 1953, starring Rhonda Fleming. Fleming, who also starred in &quot;Those Redheads From Seattle&quot;, and &quot;Jivaro&quot;, shares the spot for being the actress to appear in the most 3D features with Patricia Medina, who starred in &quot;Sangaree&quot;, &quot;Phantom of the Rue Morgue&quot; and &quot;Drums of Tahiti&quot;. Darryl F. Zanuck expressed little interest in stereoscopic systems, and at that point was preparing to premiere the new widescreen film system, CinemaScope.

The first decline in the theatrical 3D craze started in August and September 1953. The factors causing this decline were:

* Two prints had to be projected simultaneously.
* The prints had to remain exactly alike after repair, or synchronization would be lost.
* It sometimes required two projectionists to keep sync working properly.
* When either prints or shutters became out of sync, even for a single frame, the picture became virtually unwatchable and accounted for headaches and eyestrain.
* The necessary silver projection screen was very directional and caused sideline seating to be unusable with both 3D and regular films, due to the angular darkening of these screens. Later films that opened in wider-seated venues often premiered flat for that reason (such as &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; at the Radio City Music Hall).
* A mandatory intermission was needed to properly prepare the theater&#x27;s projectors for the showing of the second half of the film.

Because projection booth operators were at many times careless, even at preview screenings of 3D films, trade and newspaper critics claimed that certain films were &quot;hard on the eyes.&quot;

Sol Lesser attempted to follow up &quot;Stereo Techniques&quot; with a new showcase, this time five shorts that he himself produced. The project was to be called &quot;The 3-D Follies&quot; and was to be distributed by RKO. Unfortunately, because of financial difficulties and the general loss of interest in 3D, Lesser canceled the project during the summer of 1953, making it the first 3D film to be aborted in production. Two of the three shorts were shot: &quot;Carmenesque&quot;, a burlesque number starring exotic dancer Lili St. Cyr, and &quot;Fun in the Sun&quot;, a sports short directed by famed set designer/director William Cameron Menzies, who also directed the 3D feature &quot;The Maze&quot; for Allied Artists.

Although it was more expensive to install, the major competing realism process was wide-screen, but two-dimensional, anamorphic, first utilized by Fox with CinemaScope and its September premiere in &quot;The Robe&quot;. Anamorphic films needed only a single print, so synchronization was not an issue. Cinerama was also a competitor from the start and had better quality control than 3D because it was owned by one company that focused on quality control. However, most of the 3D features past the summer of 1953 were released in the flat widescreen formats ranging from 1.66:1 to 1.85:1. In early studio advertisements and articles about widescreen and 3D formats, widescreen systems were referred to as &quot;3D&quot;, causing some confusion among scholars.

There was no single instance of combining CinemaScope with 3D until 1960, with a film called &quot;September Storm&quot;, and even then, that was a blow-up from a non-anamorphic negative. &quot;September Storm&quot; also went out with the last dual-strip short, &quot;Space Attack&quot;, which was actually shot in 1954 under the title &quot;The Adventures of Sam Space&quot;.

In December 1953, 3D made a comeback with the release of several important 3D films, including MGM&#x27;s musical &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;. &quot;Kate&quot; was the hill over which 3D had to pass to survive. MGM tested it in six theaters: three in 3D and three-flat. According to trade ads of the time, the 3D version was so well-received that the film quickly went into a wide stereoscopic release. However, most publications, including Kenneth Macgowan&#x27;s classic film reference book &quot;Behind the Screen&quot;, state that the film did much better as a &quot;regular&quot; release. The film, adapted from the popular Cole Porter Broadway musical, starred the MGM songbird team of Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson as the leads, supported by Ann Miller, Keenan Wynn, Bobby Van, James Whitmore, Kurt Kasznar and Tommy Rall. The film also prominently promoted its use of stereophonic sound.

Several other features that helped put 3D back on the map that month were the John Wayne feature &quot;Hondo&quot; (distributed by Warner Bros.), Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson&quot; with Rita Hayworth, and Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Money From Home&quot; with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Paramount also released the cartoon shorts &quot;Boo Moon&quot; with Casper, the Friendly Ghost and &quot;Popeye, Ace of Space&quot; with Popeye the Sailor. Paramount Pictures released a 3D Korean War film &quot;Cease Fire&quot; filmed on actual Korean locations in 1953.

&quot;Top Banana&quot;, based on the popular stage musical with Phil Silvers, was brought to the screen with the original cast. Although it was merely a filmed stage production, the idea was that every audience member would feel they would have the best seat in the house through color photography and 3D. Although the film was shot and edited in 3D, United Artists, the distributor, felt the production was uneconomical in stereoscopic form and released the film flat on January 27, 1954. It remains one of two &quot;Golden era&quot; 3D features, along with another United Artists feature, &quot;Southwest Passage&quot; (with John Ireland and Joanne Dru), that are currently considered lost (although flat versions survive).

A string of successful films filmed in 3D followed the second wave, but many were widely or exclusively shown flat. Some highlights are:
* &quot;The French Line&quot;, starring Jane Russell and Gilbert Roland, a Howard Hughes/RKO production. The film became notorious for being released without an MPAA seal of approval after several suggestive lyrics were included, as well as one of Ms. Russell&#x27;s particularly revealing costumes. Playing up her sex appeal, one tagline for the film was, &quot;It&#x27;ll knock &quot;both&quot; of your eyes out!&quot; The film was later cut and approved by the MPAA for a general flat release, despite having a wide and profitable 3D release.
* &quot;Taza, Son of Cochise&quot;, a sequel to 1950s &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, which starred Rock Hudson in the title role, Barbara Rush as the love interest, and Rex Reason (billed as Bart Roberts) as his renegade brother. Originally released flat through Universal-International. It was directed by the great stylist Douglas Sirk, and his striking visual sense made the film a huge success when it was &quot;re-premiered&quot; in 3D in 2006 at the Second 3D Expo in Hollywood.
* Two ape films: &quot;Phantom of the Rue Morgue&quot;, featuring Karl Malden and Patricia Medina, produced by Warner Bros. and based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, and &quot;Gorilla at Large&quot;, a Panoramic Production starring Cameron Mitchell, distributed flat and 3D through Fox.
* &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, starring Richard Carlson and Julie Adams, directed by Jack Arnold. Although arguably the most famous 3D film, it was typically seen in 3D only in large urban theaters and shown flat in the many smaller neighborhood theaters. It was the only 3D feature that spawned a 3D sequel, &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot;, which was in turn followed by &quot;The Creature Walks Among Us&quot;, shot flat.
* &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Ray Milland, Robert Cummings, and Grace Kelly, is considered by aficionados of 3D to be one of the best examples of the process. Although available in 3D in 1954, there are no known playdates in 3D, since Warner Bros. had just instated a simultaneous 3D/2D release policy. The film&#x27;s screening in 3D in February 1980 at the York Theater in San Francisco did so well that Warner Bros. re-released the film in 3D in February 1982. The film is now available on 3D Blu-ray, marking the first time it was released on home video in its 3D presentation.
* &quot;Gog&quot;, the last episode in Ivan Tors&#x27; &quot;Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI)&quot; trilogy dealing with realistic science fiction (following &quot;The Magnetic Monster&quot; and &quot;Riders to the Stars&quot;). Most theaters showed it flat.
* &quot;The Diamond&quot; (released in the United States as &quot;The Diamond Wizard&quot;), a 1954 British crime film starring Dennis O&#x27;Keefe. The only stereoscopic feature shot in Britain, released flat in both the UK and US.
* Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Mission&quot; released by RKO in 1954 featuring Allen&#x27;s trademarks of an all-star cast facing a disaster (a forest fire). Bosley Crowther&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; review mentions that it was shown flat.
* &quot;Son of Sinbad&quot;, another RKO/Howard Hughes production, starring Dale Robertson, Lili St. Cyr, and Vincent Price. The film was shelved after Hughes ran into difficulty with &quot;The French Line&quot;, and was not released until 1955, at which time it went out flat, converted to the SuperScope process.

3D&#x27;s final decline was in the late spring of 1954, for the same reasons as the previous lull, as well as the further success of widescreen formats with theater operators. Even though Polaroid had created a well-designed &quot;Tell-Tale Filter Kit&quot; for the purpose of recognizing and adjusting out of sync and phase 3D, exhibitors still felt uncomfortable with the system and turned their focus instead to processes such as CinemaScope. The last 3D feature to be released in that format during the &quot;Golden era&quot; was &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot;, on February 23, 1955. Ironically, the film had a wide release in 3D and was well received at the box office.

===Revival (1960–1984) in single strip format===

Stereoscopic films largely remained dormant for the first part of the 1960s, with those that were released usually being anaglyph exploitation films. One film of notoriety was the Beaver-Champion/Warner Bros. production, &quot;The Mask&quot; (1961). The film was shot in 2-D, but to enhance the bizarre qualities of the dream-world that is induced when the main character puts on a cursed tribal mask, these scenes went to anaglyph 3D. These scenes were printed by Technicolor on their first run in red/green anaglyph.

Although 3D films appeared sparsely during the early 1960s, the true second wave of 3D cinema was set into motion by Arch Oboler, the producer who had started the craze of the 1950s. Using a new technology called &quot;Space-Vision 3D&quot;. The origin of &quot;Space-Vision 3D&quot; goes back to Colonel Robert Vincent Bernier, a forgotten innovator in the history of stereoscopic motion pictures. His Trioptiscope Space-Vision lens was the gold standard for the production and exhibition of 3-D films for nearly 30 years. &quot;Space-Vision 3D&quot; stereoscopic films were printed with two images, one above the other, in a single academy ratio frame, on a single strip, and needed only one projector fitted with a special lens. This so-called &quot;over and under&quot; technique eliminated the need for dual projector set-ups, and produced widescreen, but darker, less vivid, polarized 3D images. Unlike earlier dual system, it could stay in perfect synchronization, unless improperly spliced in repair.

Arch Oboler once again had the vision for the system that no one else would touch, and put it to use on his film entitled &quot;The Bubble&quot;, which starred Michael Cole, Deborah Walley, and Johnny Desmond. As with &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, the critics panned &quot;The Bubble&quot;, but audiences flocked to see it, and it became financially sound enough to promote the use of the system to other studios, particularly independents, who did not have the money for expensive dual-strip prints of their productions.

In 1970, Stereovision, a new entity founded by director/inventor Allan Silliphant and optical designer Chris Condon, developed a different 35 mm single-strip format, which printed two images squeezed side by side and used an anamorphic lens to widen the pictures through Polaroid filters. Louis K. Sher (Sherpix) and Stereovision released the softcore sex comedy &quot;The Stewardesses&quot; (self-rated X, but later re-rated R by the MPAA). The film cost US$100,000 to produce, and ran for months in several markets. eventually earning $27 million in North America, alone ($140 million in constant-2010 dollars) in fewer than 800 theaters, becoming the most profitable 3-Dimensional film to date, and in purely relative terms, one of the most profitable films ever. It was later released in 70 mm 3D. Some 36 films worldwide were made with Stereovision over 25 years, using either a widescreen (above-below), anamorphic (side by side) or 70 mm 3D formats. In 2009 &quot;The Stewardesses&quot; was remastered by Chris Condon and director Ed Meyer, releasing it in XpanD 3D, RealD Cinema and Dolby 3D.

The quality of the 1970s 3D films was not much more inventive, as many were either softcore and even hardcore adult films, horror films, or a combination of both. Paul Morrisey&#x27;s &quot;Flesh For Frankenstein&quot; (aka &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot;) was a superlative example of such a combination.

Between 1981 and 1983 there was a new Hollywood 3D craze started by the spaghetti western &quot;Comin&#x27; at Ya!&quot;. When &quot;Parasite&quot; was released it was billed as the first horror film to come out in 3D in over 20 years. Horror films and reissues of 1950s 3D classics (such as Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;) dominated the 3D releases that followed. The second sequel in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series, &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot;, was released very successfully. Apparently saying &quot;part 3 in 3D&quot; was considered too cumbersome so it was shortened in the titles of &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; and &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot;, which emphasized the screen effects to the point of being annoying at times, especially when flashlights were shone into the eyes of the audience.

The science fiction film &quot;&quot; was the most expensive 3D film made up to that point with production costs about the same as &quot;Star Wars&quot; but not nearly the same box office success, causing the craze to fade quickly through spring 1983. Other sci-fi/fantasy films were released as well including &quot;&quot; and &quot;Treasure of the Four Crowns&quot;, which was widely criticized for poor editing and plot holes, but did feature some truly spectacular closeups.

3D releases after the second craze included &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (1983), &quot;Silent Madness&quot; and the 1985 animated film &quot;&quot;, whose plot seemed to borrow heavily from &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Only &quot;Comin&#x27; At Ya!&quot;, &quot;Parasite&quot;, and &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot; have been officially released on VHS and/or DVD in 3D in the United States (although &quot;Amityville 3D&quot; has seen a 3D DVD release in the United Kingdom). Most of the 1980s 3D films and some of the classic 1950s films such as &quot;House of Wax&quot; were released on the now defunct Video Disc (VHD) format in Japan as part of a system that used shutter glasses. Most of these have been unofficially transferred to DVD and are available on the grey market through sites such as eBay.

Stereoscopic movies were also popular in other parts of the world, such as My Dear Kuttichathan, a Malayalam film which was shot with stereoscopic 3D and released in 1984.

===Rebirth of 3D (1985–2003)===

In the mid-1980s, IMAX began producing non-fiction films for its nascent 3D business, starting with &quot;We Are Born of Stars&quot; (Roman Kroitor, 1985). A key point was that this production, as with all subsequent IMAX productions, emphasized mathematical correctness of the 3D rendition and thus largely eliminated the eye fatigue and pain that resulted from the approximate geometries of previous 3D incarnations. In addition, and in contrast to previous 35mm-based 3D presentations, the very large field of view provided by IMAX allowed a much broader 3D &quot;stage&quot;, arguably as important in 3D film as it is theatre.

The Walt Disney Company also began more prominent use of 3D films in special venues to impress audiences with Magic Journeys (1982) and &quot;Captain EO&quot; (Francis Ford Coppola, 1986, starring Michael Jackson) being notable examples. In the same year, the National Film Board of Canada production &quot;Transitions&quot; (Colin Low), created for Expo 86 in Vancouver, was the first IMAX presentation using polarized glasses. &quot;Echoes of the Sun&quot; (Roman Kroitor, 1990) was the first IMAX film to be presented using alternate-eye shutterglass technology, a development required because the dome screen precluded the use of polarized technology.

From 1990 onward, numerous films were produced by all three parties to satisfy the demands of their various high-profile special attractions and IMAX&#x27;s expanding 3D network. Films of special note during this period include the extremely successful &quot;Into the Deep&quot; (Graeme Ferguson, 1995) and the first IMAX 3D fiction film &quot;Wings of Courage&quot; (1996), by director Jean-Jacques Annaud, about the pilot Henri Guillaumet.

Other stereoscopic films produced in this period include:

*&quot;The Last Buffalo&quot; (Stephen Low, 1990)
*&quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; (Jim Henson, 1991)
*&quot;Imagine&quot; (John Weiley, 1993)
*&quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience&quot; (Daniel Rustuccio, 1994)
*&quot;Into the Deep&quot; (Graeme Ferguson, 1995)
*&quot;Across the Sea of Time&quot; (Stephen Low, 1995)
*&quot;Wings of Courage&quot; (Jean-Jacques Annaud, 1996)
*&quot;L5, First City in Space&quot; (Graeme Ferguson, 1996)
*&quot;T2 3-D: Battle Across Time&quot; (James Cameron, 1996)
*&quot;Paint Misbehavin&quot; (Roman Kroitor and Peter Stephenson, 1997)
*&quot;IMAX Nutcracker&quot; (1997)
*&quot;The Hidden Dimension&quot; (1997)
*&quot;T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous&quot; (Brett Leonard, 1998)
*&quot;Mark Twain&#x27;s America&quot; (Stephen Low, 1998)
*&quot;Siegfried &amp; Roy: The Magic Box&quot; (Brett Leonard, 1999)
*&quot;Galapagos&quot; (Al Giddings and David Clark, 1999)
*&quot;Encounter in the Third Dimension&quot; (Ben Stassen, 1999)
*&quot;Alien Adventure&quot; (Ben Stassen, 1999)
*&quot;Ultimate G&#x27;s&quot; (2000)
*&quot;Cyberworld&quot; (Hugh Murray, 2000)
*&quot;Cirque du Soleil: Journey of Man&quot; (Keith Melton, 2000)
*&quot;Haunted Castle&quot; (Ben Stassen, 2001)
*&quot;Panda Vision&quot; (Ben Stassen, 2001)
*&quot;Space Station 3D&quot; (Toni Myers, 2002)
*&quot;SOS Planet&quot; (Ben Stassen, 2002)
*&quot;Ocean Wonderland&quot; (2003)
*&quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (Munro Ferguson, 2003)
*&quot;Misadventures in 3D&quot; (Ben Stassen, 2003)

By 2004, 54% of IMAX theaters (133 of 248) were capable of showing 3D films.

Shortly thereafter, higher quality computer animation, competition from DVDs and other media, digital projection, digital video capture, and the use of sophisticated IMAX 70mm film projectors, created an opportunity for another wave of 3D films.

===Mainstream resurgence (2003–2010)===
In 2003, &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot; by James Cameron was released as the first full-length 3D IMAX feature filmed with the Reality Camera System. This camera system used the latest HD video cameras, not film, and was built for Cameron by Vince Pace, to his specifications. The same camera system was used to film &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot; (2003), &quot;Aliens of the Deep&quot; IMAX (2005), and &quot;The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D&quot; (2005).

In 2004, Las Vegas Hilton released Star Trek: The Experience which included two films. One of the films, &quot;Borg Invasion 4-D&quot; (Ty Granoroli), was in 3D. In August of the same year, rap group Insane Clown Posse released their ninth studio album &quot;Hell&#x27;s Pit&quot;. One of two versions of the album contained a DVD featuring a 3D short film for the track &quot;Bowling Balls&quot;, shot in high-definition video.

In November 2004, &quot;The Polar Express&quot; was released as IMAX&#x27;s first full-length, animated 3D feature. It was released in 3,584 theaters in 2D, and only 66 IMAX locations. The return from those few 3D theaters was about 25% of the total. The 3D version earned about 14 times as much per screen as the 2D version. This pattern continued and prompted a greatly intensified interest in 3D and 3D presentation of animated films.

In June 2005, the Mann&#x27;s Chinese 6 theatre in Hollywood became the first commercial film theatre to be equipped with the Digital 3D format. Both &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; and &quot;The Polar Express&quot; were tested in the Digital 3D format over the course of several months. In November 2005, Walt Disney Studio Entertainment released &quot;Chicken Little&quot; in digital 3D format.

&quot;The Butler&#x27;s in Love&quot;, a short film directed by David Arquette and starring Elizabeth Berkley and Thomas Jane was released on June 23, 2008. The film was shot at the former Industrial Light &amp; Magic studios using KernerFX&#x27;s prototype Kernercam stereoscopic camera rig.

Ben Walters suggested in 2009 that both filmmakers and film exhibitors regain interest in 3D film. There was more 3D exhibition equipment, and more dramatic films being shot in 3D format. One incentive is that the technology is more mature. Shooting in 3D format is less limited, and the result is more stable. Another incentive was the fact that while 2D ticket sales were in an overall state of decline, revenues from 3D tickets continued to grow at the time.

Through the entire history of 3D presentations, techniques to convert existing 2D images for 3D presentation have existed. Few have been effective or survived. The combination of digital and digitized source material with relatively cost-effective digital post-processing has spawned a new wave of conversion products. In June 2006, IMAX and Warner Bros. released &quot;Superman Returns&quot; including 20 minutes of 3D images converted from the 2D original digital footage. George Lucas announced that he would re-release his &quot;Star Wars&quot; films in 3D based on a conversion process from the company In-Three. Later on in 2011, it was announced that Lucas was working with the company Prime Focus on this conversion.

In late 2005, Steven Spielberg told the press he was involved in patenting a 3D cinema system that did not need glasses, based on plasma screens. A computer splits each film-frame, and then projects the two split images onto the screen at differing angles, to be picked up by tiny angled ridges on the screen.

Animated films &quot;Open Season&quot;, and &quot;The Ant Bully&quot;, were released in analog 3D in 2006. &quot;Monster House&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; were released on XpanD 3D, RealD and Dolby 3D systems in 2006.

On May 19, 2007 &quot;Scar3D&quot; opened at the Cannes Film Market. It was the first US-produced 3D full-length feature film to be completed in Real D 3D. It has been the #1 film at the box office in several countries around the world, including Russia where it opened in 3D on 295 screens.

On January 19, 2008, U2 3D was released; it was the first live-action digital 3D film. In the same year others 3D films included &quot;Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, and &quot;Bolt&quot;.

On January 16, 2009, Lionsgate released &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3D&quot;, the first horror film and first R-rated film to be projected in Real D 3D. It was released to 1,033 3D screens, the most ever for this format, and 1,501 regular screens. Another R-rated film, &quot;The Final Destination&quot;, was released later that year in August on even more screens. It was the first of its series to be released in HD 3D. 
Major 3D films in 2009 included &quot;Coraline&quot;, &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;X Games 3D: The Movie&quot;, &quot;The Final Destination&quot;, &quot;Disney&#x27;s A Christmas Carol&quot;, and &quot;Avatar&quot;. &quot;Avatar&quot; has gone on to be one of the most expensive films of all time, with a budget at $237 million; it is also the highest-grossing film of all time. The main technologies used to exhibit these films, and many others released around the time and up to the present, are RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, MasterImage 3D, and IMAX 3D. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions and caused 3D films to increase in popularity.

March and April 2010 saw three major 3D releases clustered together, with &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; hitting US theaters on March 5, 2010, &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; on March 26, 2010, and &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; on April 2, 2010. On May 13 of the same year, China&#x27;s first IMAX 3D film started shooting. The pre-production of the first 3D film shot in France, &quot;Derrière les murs&quot;, began in May 2010 and was released in mid-2011.

On October 1, 2010 &quot;Scar3D&quot; was the first-ever stereoscopic 3D Video-on-demand film released through major cable broadcasters for 3D televisions in the United States. Released in the United States on May 21, 2010, &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; by DreamWorks Animation (Paramount Pictures) used the Real D 3D system, also released in IMAX 3D.

====World 3-D Expositions====
In September 2003, Sabucat Productions organized the first World 3-D Exposition, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the original craze. The Expo was held at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre. During the two-week festival, over 30 of the 50 &quot;golden era&quot; stereoscopic features (as well as shorts) were screened, many coming from the collection of film historian and archivist Robert Furmanek, who had spent the previous 15 years painstakingly tracking down and preserving each film to its original glory. In attendance were many stars from each film, respectively, and some were moved to tears by the sold-out seating with audiences of film buffs from all over the world who came to remember their previous glories.

In May 2006, the second World 3-D Exposition was announced for September of that year, presented by the 3-D Film Preservation Fund. Along with the favorites of the previous exposition were newly discovered features and shorts, and like the previous Expo, guests from each film. Expo II was announced as being the locale for the world premiere of several films never before seen in 3D, including &quot;The Diamond Wizard&quot; and the Universal short, &quot;Hawaiian Nights&quot; with Mamie Van Doren and Pinky Lee. Other &quot;re-premieres&quot; of films not seen since their original release in stereoscopic form included &quot;Cease Fire!&quot;, &quot;Taza, Son of Cochise&quot;, &quot;Wings of the Hawk&quot;, and &quot;Those Redheads From Seattle&quot;. Also shown were the long-lost shorts &quot;Carmenesque&quot; and &quot;A Day in the Country&quot; (both 1953) and William Van Doren Kelley&#x27;s two &quot;Plasticon&quot; shorts (1922 and 1923).

===Audience decline in theaters &amp; 3D streaming (2011–present)===
In the wake of its initial popularity and corresponding increase in the number of screens, more films were being released in the 3D format, yet fewer people were choosing to see them in such a way. For instance, only 45% of the premiere weekend box office earnings of &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot; in 2011 came from 3D screenings as opposed to 60% for &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; in 2010. In addition, the premiere of &quot;Cars 2&quot; opening weekend gross consisted of only 37% from 3D theatres. &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; and &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; were major releases that achieved similar percentages: 43% and 40% respectively. In view of this trend, there has been box office analysis concluding the implementation of 3D presentation is apparently backfiring by discouraging people from going to film theatres at all. As Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo notes, &quot;In each case, 3D&#x27;s more-money-from-fewer-people approach has simply led to less money from even fewer people.&quot; Parallel, the number of televisions sold with support for 3D television has dropped, let alone those sold with actual 3D goggles.

According to the Motion Picture Association of America, despite a record total of 47 3D films being released in 2011, the overall domestic box office receipts were down 18% to $1.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2010. Although revenues as a whole increased during 2012, the bulk has so far come from 2D presentations as exemplified by little over 50% of filmgoers opting to see the likes of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and 32% choosing &quot;Brave&quot; in their 3D versions. Conflicting reasons are respectively offered by studios and exhibitors: whereas the former blame more expensive 3D ticket prices, the latter argue that the quality of films in general is at fault. However, despite the perceived decline of 3D in the U.S. market, studio chiefs in 2012 were optimistic of better receipts internationally, where there still appeared to be a strong appetite for the format.

Studios are also using 3D to generate additional income from films that are already commercially successful. Such re-releases usually involve a conversion from 2D. For example, Disney has reissued both &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, with plans to add some of its other well-known titles. &quot;Titanic&quot; has also been modified for 3D, and there are also plans to similarly present all six &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

Jeffrey Katzenberg, a producer of 3D films and one of the leading proponents of the format, blames oversaturation of the market with inferior films, especially ones photographed conventionally and then digitally processed in post-production. He claims that such films have led audiences to conclude that the format is not worth the often much higher ticket price. Daniel Engber, a columnist for &quot;Slate&quot;, comes to a similar conclusion: &quot;What happened to 3-D? It may have died from a case of acute septicemia—too much crap in the system.&quot;

Film critic Mark Kermode, a noted detractor of 3D, has surmised that there is an emerging policy of distributors to limit the availability of 2D versions, thus &quot;railroading&quot; the 3D format into cinemas whether the paying filmgoer likes it or not. This was especially prevalent during the release of &quot;Prometheus&quot; in 2012, where only 30% of prints for theatrical exhibition (at least in the UK) were in 2D. His suspicions were later reinforced by a substantial number of complaints about &quot;Dredd&quot; from those who wished to see it in 2D but were denied the opportunity. In July 2017, IMAX announced that they would begin to focus on screening more Hollywood tentpole movies in 2D (even if there&#x27;s a 3D version) and have fewer 3D screenings of movies in North America, citing that moviegoers in North America prefer 2D films over 3D films.

In 2024, 3D films in 4K HDR became available to home media for the first time, with the launch of the visionOS operating system offering two services to access movies in such formats: Apple TV and Disney+. Some films were also offered in high frame rate (48fps), such as &quot;&quot;. Other 3D media shot in 8K with a 180-degree view was also made available under the moniker &quot;Apple Immersive Video.&quot;

==Techniques==
Stereoscopic motion pictures can be produced through a variety of different methods. Over the years the popularity of systems being widely employed in film theaters has waxed and waned. Though anaglyph was sometimes used prior to 1948, during the early &quot;Golden Era&quot; of 3D cinematography of the 1950s the polarization system was used for every single feature-length film in the United States, and all but one short film. In the 21st century, polarization 3D systems have continued to dominate the scene, though during the 1960s and 1970s some classic films which were converted to anaglyph for theaters not equipped for polarization, and were even shown in 3D on television. In the years following the mid-1980s, some films were made with short segments in anaglyph 3D. The following are some of the technical details and methodologies employed in some of the more notable 3D film systems that have been developed.

===Producing 3D films===

====Live action====

The standard for shooting live-action films in 3D involves using two cameras mounted so that their lenses are about as far apart from each other as the average pair of human eyes, recording two separate images for both the left eye and the right eye. In principle, two normal 2D cameras could be put side-to-side but this is problematic in many ways. The only real option is to invest in new stereoscopic cameras. Moreover, some cinematographic tricks that are simple with a 2D camera become impossible when filming in 3D. This means those otherwise cheap tricks need to be replaced by expensive CGI.

In 2008, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; became the first live-action feature film to be shot with the earliest Fusion Camera System released in Digital 3D and was later followed by several others. &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) was shot in a 3D process that is based on how the human eye looks at an image. It was an improvement to the existing 3D camera system. Many 3D camera rigs still in use simply pair two cameras side by side, while newer rigs are paired with a beam splitter or both camera lenses built into one unit. While Digital Cinema cameras are not a requirement for 3D they are the predominant medium for most of what is photographed. Film options include IMAX 3D and Cine 160.

====Animation====
In the 1930s and 1940s, the Fleischer Studios made several cartoons with extensive stereoscopic 3D backgrounds, including several &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;, &quot;Betty Boop&quot;, and &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons.

In the early to mid-1950s, only half of the major Animation film studios operation experimented with creating traditional 3D animated short subjects. Walt Disney Studio produced two traditional animation short for stereoscopic 3D, for cinemas. &quot;Adventures in Music: Melody&quot; (1953), and the Donald Duck cartoon &quot;Working for Peanuts&quot; (1953). Warner Brothers only produced a single cartoon in 3D: &quot;Lumber Jack-Rabbit&quot; (1953) starring Bugs Bunny. Famous Studios produced two cartoons in 3D, the Popeye cartoon &quot;Popeye, the Ace of Space&quot; (1953), and the Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon &quot;Boo Moon&quot; (1954). Walter Lantz Studio produced the Woody Woodpecker cartoon &quot;Hypnotic Hick&quot; (1953), which was distributed by Universal.

From the late 1950s until the mid-2000s almost no animation was produced for 3D display in theaters. Although several films used 3D backgrounds. One exception is &quot;&quot;.

CGI animated films can be rendered as stereoscopic 3D version by using two virtual cameras. Stop-motion animated 3D films are photographed with two cameras similar to live action 3D films.

In 2004 &quot;The Polar Express&quot; was the first stereoscopic 3D CGI-animated feature film. The 3D version was solely released in IMAX theaters. In November 2005, Walt Disney Studio Entertainment released &quot;Chicken Little&quot; in digital 3D format, being Disney&#x27;s first CGI-animated film in 3D. The film was converted from 2D into 3D in post production. nWave Pictures&#x27; &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; (2008) was actually the first animated film created for 3D and released exclusively in 3D in digital theaters around the world. No other animation films have released solely in 3D since. The first 3D feature by DreamWorks Animation, &quot;Monsters vs Aliens&quot;, followed in 2009 and used a new digital rendering process called InTru3D, which was developed by Intel to create more realistic animated 3D images. InTru3D is not used to exhibit 3D films in theaters; they are shown in either RealD 3D or IMAX 3D.

====2D to 3D conversion====
In the case of 2D CGI animated films that were generated from 3D models, it is possible to return to the models to generate a 3D version.

For all other 2D films, different techniques must be employed. For example, for the 3D re-release of the 1993 film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, Walt Disney Pictures scanned each original frame and manipulated them to produce left-eye and right-eye versions. Dozens of films have now been converted from 2D to 3D. There are several approaches used for 2D to 3D conversion, most notably depth-based methods.

However, conversion to 3D has problems. Information is unavailable as 2D does not have information for a perspective view. Some TVs have a 3D engine to convert 2D content to 3D. Usually, on high frame rate content (and on some slower processors even normal frame rate) the processor is not fast enough and lag is possible. This can lead to strange visual effects.

===Displaying 3D films===
====Anaglyph====

Anaglyph images were the earliest method of presenting theatrical 3D, and the one most commonly associated with stereoscopy by the public at large, mostly because of non-theatrical 3D media such as comic books and 3D television broadcasts, where polarization is not practical. They were made popular because of the ease of their production and exhibition. The first anaglyph film was invented in 1915 by Edwin S Porter. Though the earliest theatrical presentations were done with this system, most 3D films from the 1950s and 1980s were originally shown polarized.

In an anaglyph, the two images are superimposed in an additive light setting through two filters, one red and one cyan. In a subtractive light setting, the two images are printed in the same complementary colors on white paper. Glasses with colored filters in each eye separate the appropriate images by canceling the filter color out and rendering the complementary color black.

Anaglyph images are much easier to view than either parallel sighting or crossed eye stereograms, although the latter types offer bright and accurate color rendering, particularly in the red component, which is muted, or desaturated with even the best color anaglyphs. A compensating technique, commonly known as Anachrome, uses a slightly more transparent cyan filter in the patented glasses associated with the technique. Process reconfigures the typical anaglyph image to have less parallax.

An alternative to the usual red and cyan filter system of anaglyph is ColorCode 3-D, a patented anaglyph system which was invented in order to present an anaglyph image in conjunction with the NTSC television standard, in which the red channel is often compromised. ColorCode uses the complementary colors of yellow and dark blue on-screen, and the colors of the glasses&#x27; lenses are amber and dark blue.

The &quot;polarization 3D system&quot; has been the standard for theatrical presentations since it was used for &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; in 1952, though early Imax presentations were done using the eclipse system and in the 1960s and 1970s classic 3D films were sometimes converted to anaglyph for special presentations. The polarization system has better color fidelity and less ghosting than the anaglyph system. In the post-&#x27;50s era, anaglyph has been used instead of polarization in feature presentations where only part of the film is in 3D such as in the 3D segment of &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; and the 3D segments of &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot;.

Anaglyph is also used in printed materials and in 3D television broadcasts where polarization is not practical. 3D polarized televisions and other displays only became available from several manufacturers in 2008; these generate polarization on the receiving end.

====Polarization systems====


To present a stereoscopic motion picture, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through different polarizing filters. The viewer wears low-cost glasses which also contain a pair of polarizing filters oriented differently (clockwise/counterclockwise with circular polarization or at 90 degree angles, usually 45 and 135 degrees, with linear polarization). As each filter passes only that light which is similarly polarized and blocks the light polarized differently, each eye sees a different image. This is used to produce a three-dimensional effect by projecting the same scene into both eyes, but depicted from slightly different perspectives. Since no head tracking is involved, the entire audience can view the stereoscopic images at the same time.
Circular polarization has an advantage over linear polarization, in that the viewer does not need to have their head upright and aligned with the screen for the polarization to work properly. With linear polarization, turning the glasses sideways causes the filters to go out of alignment with the screen filters causing the image to fade and for each eye to see the opposite frame more easily. For circular polarization, the polarizing effect works regardless of how the viewer&#x27;s head is aligned with the screen such as tilted sideways, or even upside down. The left eye will still only see the image intended for it, and vice versa, without fading or crosstalk. Nonetheless, 3D cinema films are made to be viewed without head tilt, and any significant head tilt will result in incorrect parallax and prevent binocular fusion.

In the case of RealD a circularly polarizing liquid crystal filter which can switch polarity 144 times per second is placed in front of the projector lens. Only one projector is needed, as the left and right eye images are displayed alternately. Sony features a new system called RealD XLS, which shows both circular polarized images simultaneously: A single 4K projector (4096×2160 resolution) displays both 2K images (2048×1080 resolution) on top of each other at the same time, a special lens attachment polarizes and projects the images.

Optical attachments can be added to traditional 35mm projectors to adapt them for projecting film in the &quot;over-and-under&quot; format, in which each pair of images is stacked within one frame of film. The two images are projected through different polarizers and superimposed on the screen. This is a very cost-effective way to convert a theater for 3-D as all that is needed are the attachments and a non-depolarizing screen surface, rather than a conversion to digital 3-D projection. Thomson Technicolor currently produces an adapter of this type. A metallic screen is necessary for these systems as reflection from non-metallic surfaces destroys the polarization of the light.

Polarized stereoscopic pictures have been around since 1936, when Edwin H. Land first applied it to motion pictures. The so-called &quot;3-D movie craze&quot; in the years 1952 through 1955 was almost entirely offered in theaters using linear polarizing projection and glasses. Only a minute amount of the total 3D films shown in the period used the anaglyph color filter method. Linear polarization was likewise used with consumer level stereo projectors. Polarization was also used during the 3D revival of the 1980s.

In the 2000s, computer animation, competition from DVDs and other media, digital projection, and the use of sophisticated IMAX 70mm film projectors, have created an opportunity for a new wave of polarized 3D films.

All types of polarization will result in a darkening of the displayed image and poorer contrast compared to non-3D images. Light from lamps is normally emitted as a random collection of polarizations, while a polarization filter only passes a fraction of the light. As a result, the screen image is darker. This darkening can be compensated by increasing the brightness of the projector light source. If the initial polarization filter is inserted between the lamp and the image generation element, the light intensity striking the image element is not any higher than normal without the polarizing filter, and overall image contrast transmitted to the screen is not affected.

====Active shutter====

In this technology, a mechanism is used to block light from each appropriate eye when the converse eye&#x27;s image is projected on the screen.

The technology originated with the Eclipse Method, in which the projector alternates between left and right images, and opens and closes the shutters in the glasses or viewer in synchronization with the images on the screen. This was the basis of the Teleview system which was used briefly in 1922.

A newer implementation of the Eclipse Method came with LCD shutter glasses. Glasses containing liquid crystal that will let light through in synchronization with the images on the cinema, television or computer screen, using the concept of alternate-frame sequencing. This is the method used by nVidia, XpanD 3D, and earlier IMAX systems. A drawback of this method is the need for each person viewing to wear expensive, electronic glasses that must be synchronized with the display system using a wireless signal or attached wire. The shutter-glasses are heavier than most polarized glasses, though lighter models are no heavier than some sunglasses or deluxe polarized glasses. However these systems do not require a silver screen for projected images.

Liquid crystal light valves work by rotating light between two polarizing filters. Due to these internal polarizers, LCD shutter-glasses darken the display image of any LCD, plasma, or projector image source, which has the result that images appear dimmer and contrast is lower than for normal non-3D viewing. This is not necessarily a usage problem; for some types of displays which are already very bright with poor grayish black levels, LCD shutter glasses may actually improve the image quality.

====Interference filter technology====
Dolby 3D uses specific wavelengths of red, green, and blue for the right eye, and different wavelengths of red, green, and blue for the left eye. Glasses which filter out the very specific wavelengths allow the wearer to see a 3D image. This technology eliminates the expensive silver screens required for polarized systems such as RealD, which is the most common 3D display system in theaters. It does, however, require much more expensive glasses than the polarized systems. It is also known as spectral comb filtering or wavelength multiplex visualization

The recently introduced Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system also uses this technology, though with a wider spectrum and more &quot;teeth&quot; to the &quot;comb&quot; (5 for each eye in the Omega/Panavision system). The use of more spectral bands per eye eliminates the need to color process the image, required by the Dolby system. Evenly dividing the visible spectrum between the eyes gives the viewer a more relaxed &quot;feel&quot; as the light energy and color balance is nearly 50-50. Like the Dolby system, the Omega system can be used with white or silver screens. But it can be used with either film or digital projectors, unlike the Dolby filters that are only used on a digital system with a color correcting processor provided by Dolby. The Omega/Panavision system also claims that their glasses are cheaper to manufacture than those used by Dolby. In June 2012 the Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system was discontinued by DPVO Theatrical, who marketed it on behalf of Panavision, citing &quot;challenging global economic and 3D market conditions&quot;.
Although DPVO dissolved its business operations, Omega Optical continues promoting and selling 3D systems to non-theatrical markets. Omega Optical&#x27;s 3D system contains projection filters and 3D glasses. In addition to the passive stereoscopic 3D system, Omega Optical has produced enhanced anaglyph 3D glasses. The Omega&#x27;s red/cyan anaglyph glasses use complex metal oxide thin film coatings and high quality annealed glass optics.

====Autostereoscopy====
In this method, glasses are not necessary to see the stereoscopic image. Lenticular lens and parallax barrier technologies involve imposing two (or more) images on the same sheet, in narrow, alternating strips, and using a screen that either blocks one of the two images&#x27; strips (in the case of parallax barriers) or uses equally narrow lenses to bend the strips of image and make it appear to fill the entire image (in the case of lenticular prints). To produce the stereoscopic effect, the person must be positioned so that one eye sees one of the two images and the other sees the other.

Both images are projected onto a high-gain, corrugated screen which reflects light at acute angles. In order to see the stereoscopic image, the viewer must sit within a very narrow angle that is nearly perpendicular to the screen, limiting the size of the audience. Lenticular was used for theatrical presentation of numerous shorts in Russia from 1940 to 1948 and in 1946 for the feature-length film Robinson Crusoe.

Though its use in theatrical presentations has been rather limited, lenticular has been widely used for a variety of novelty items and has even been used in amateur 3D photography. Recent use includes the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D with an autostereoscopic display that was released in 2009. Other examples for this technology include autostereoscopic LCD displays on monitors, notebooks, TVs, mobile phones and gaming devices, such as the Nintendo 3DS.

==Health effects==

Some viewers have complained of headaches and eyestrain after watching 3D films. Motion sickness, in addition to other health concerns, are more easily induced by 3D presentations. One published study shows that of those who watch 3D films, nearly 55% experience varying levels of headaches, nausea and disorientation. Glasses designed to eliminate eyestrain by converting 3D images back into 2D have been developed.

There are two primary effects of 3D film that are unnatural for human vision: crosstalk between the eyes, caused by imperfect image separation, and the mismatch between convergence and accommodation, caused by the difference between an object&#x27;s perceived position in front of, or behind the screen and the real origin of that light on the screen.

It is believed that approximately 12% of people are unable to properly see 3D images, due to a variety of medical conditions. According to another experiment up to 30% of people have very weak stereoscopic vision preventing them from depth perception based on stereo disparity. This nullifies or greatly decreases immersion effects of digital stereo to them.

It has recently been discovered that each of the rods and cones in animal eyes can measure the distance to the point on the object that is in focus at the particular rod or cone. Each rod or cone can act as a passive LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging). The lens selects the point on the object for each pixel to which the distance is measured; that is, humans can see in 3D separately with each eye. If the brain uses this ability in addition to the stereoscopic effect and other cues no stereoscopic system can present a true 3D picture to the brain.

The French National Research Agency (ANR) has sponsored multidisciplinary research in order to understand the effects of 3D film viewing, its grammar, and its acceptance.

==Criticism==
Most of the cues required to provide humans with relative depth information are already present in traditional 2D films. For example, closer objects occlude further ones, distant objects are desaturated and hazy relative to near ones, and the brain subconsciously &quot;knows&quot; the distance of many objects when the height is known (e.g. a human figure subtending only a small amount of the screen is more likely to be 2 m tall and far away than 10 cm tall and close). In fact, only two of these depth cues are not already present in 2D films: stereopsis (or parallax) and the focus of the eyeball (accommodation).

3D film-making addresses accurate presentation of stereopsis but not of accommodation, and therefore is insufficient in providing a complete 3D illusion. However, promising results from research aimed at overcoming this shortcoming were presented at the 2010 Stereoscopic Displays and Applications conference in San Jose, U.S.

Film critic Mark Kermode argued that 3D adds &quot;not that much&quot; value to a film, and said that, while he liked &quot;Avatar&quot;, the many impressive things he saw in the film had nothing to do with 3D. Kermode has been an outspoken critic of 3D film describing the effect as a &quot;nonsense&quot; and recommends using two right or left lenses from the 3D glasses to cut out the &quot;pointy, pointy 3D stereoscopic vision&quot;, although this technique still does not improve the huge brightness loss from a 3D film. Versions of these &quot;2-D glasses&quot; are being marketed.

As pointed out in the article &quot;Virtual Space – the movies of the future&quot; in real life the 3D effect, or stereoscopic vision, depends on the distance between the eyes, which is only about inches. The depth perception this affords is only noticeable near to the head – at about arms length. It is only useful for such tasks as threading a needle. It follows that in films portraying real life, where nothing is ever shown so close to the camera, the 3D effect is not noticeable and is soon forgotten as the film proceeds.

Director Christopher Nolan has criticised the notion that traditional film does not allow depth perception, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it&#x27;s three dimensional... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a &#x27;2D movie&#x27; is a little misleading.&quot; Nolan also criticised that shooting on the required digital video does not offer a high enough quality image and that 3D cameras cannot be equipped with prime (non-zoom) lenses.

Late film critic Roger Ebert repeatedly criticized 3D film as being &quot;too dim&quot;, sometimes distracting or even nausea-inducing, and argued that it is an expensive technology that adds nothing of value to the film-going experience (since 2-D films already provide a sufficient illusion of 3D). While Ebert was &quot;not opposed to 3-D as an option&quot;, he opposed it as a replacement for traditional film, and preferred 2-D technologies such as MaxiVision48 that improve image area/resolution and frames per second.

===Brightness concerns===
Most 3D systems will cut down the brightness of the picture considerably – the light loss can be as high as 88%. Some of this loss may be compensated by running the projector&#x27;s bulb at higher power or using more powerful bulbs.

The 2D brightness cinema standard is 14 foot-lamberts (48 candela per square metre), as set by the SMPTE standard 196M. , there is no official standard for 3D brightness. According to the industry de facto standard, however, the &quot;acceptable brightness range&quot; goes as low as 3.5 fL (12 cd/m2) – just 25% of the standard 2D brightness.

Among others, Christopher Nolan has criticized the huge brightness loss: &quot;You&#x27;re not that aware of it because once you&#x27;re &#x27;in that world,&#x27; your eye compensates, but having struggled for years to get theaters up to the proper brightness, we&#x27;re not sticking polarized filters in everything.&quot;

In September 2012, the DCI standards body issued a &quot;recommended practice&quot; calling for a 3D projection brightness of 7 fL (24 cd/m2), with an acceptable range of 5–9 fL (17–31 cd/m2). It is not known how many theaters actually achieve such light levels with current technology. Prototype laser projection systems have reached 14 fL (48 cd/m2) for 3D on a cinema screen.

===Post-conversion===

Another major criticism is that many of the films in the 21st century to date were not filmed in 3D, but converted into 3-D after filming. Filmmakers who have criticized the quality of this process include James Cameron (whose film &quot;Avatar&quot; was created mostly in 3D from the ground up, with some portions of the film created in 2D, and is largely credited with the revival of 3D) and Michael Bay. However, Cameron has said that quality 2D to 3D conversions can be done if they take the time they need and the director is involved. Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; was converted into 3D in 2012, taking 60 weeks and costing $18 million.

In contrast, computer-animated films for which the original computer models are still available can be rendered in 3D easily, as the depth information is still available and does not need to be inferred or approximated. This has been done with &quot;Toy Story&quot;, among others.

<text>In the Mythological Cycle of early Irish literature, Midir (Old Irish), Midhir (Modern Irish) or Mider was a son of the Dagda of the Tuatha Dé Danann. After the Tuatha Dé were defeated by the Milesians, he lived in the sidh of Brí Léith (believed to be Ardagh Hill, Co. Longford). The name Midir may come from the old Irish word for a judge, midithir.

==Description==

In Tochmarc Étaíne, Midir appears on a brown steed wearing a green mantle and red embroidered tunic with a golden brooch reaching from shoulder to shoulder, a silver shield with a rim of gold on his back with a silver strip and gold boss. He has bright yellow hair, a five pronged spear, and a fillet of gold on his head. When Midir appears suddenly in the midst of Eochaid Airem&#x27;s court, the remark is made, “He was fair at all times, but on that night he was fairer.”

Elsewhere in Tochmarc Étaíne, the following description of Midir is provided:
A purple tunic about him, and golden yellow hair on him to the edge of his shoulders. A shining blue eye in his head. A five-pointed spear in one hand, a white-bossed shield in the other, with golden gems thereon. Eochaid was silent, for he was unaware of his being in Tara the night before, and the courts had not been opened at that hour.

==Family==

Midir is traditionally the son of The Dagda. In the First Recension of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; and in the Metrical &quot;Dindsenchas&quot;, Midir of Brí Léith is made the &quot;son of Induí son of Échtach son of Etarlam&quot;. As a son of Induí, called &quot;king of the north country, lord of horse breeding peoples,&quot; Midir would be brother or half-brother to the war-god Neit and nephew of Nuada, who is called the son of Échtach son of Etarlam.

Midir&#x27;s wife is Fuamnach, who is either beheaded by Midir&#x27;s foster-son Aengus or otherwise killed by Manannan Mac Lir. Midir&#x27;s daughters included Bri Bruachbrecc and Ogniad (or Oicnis), who was the mother of Sigmall Cael. Midir&#x27;s sons include Lir, the father of Manannan, and his foster-son is Aengus, who elsewhere is called the foster-son of Elcmar. According to the Dindsenchas (Cnogba), Midir abducts Elcmar&#x27;s daughter Englec, to the dismay of Aengus, who is in love with her.

==Mythology==
===&quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot;===
Midir is one of the leading characters in the Old Irish saga &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of Étaín&quot;), which makes leaps through time from the age of the Túatha Dé Danann to the time of Eochaid Airem, High King of Ireland. Midir is the husband of Fúamnach but falls in love with Étaín, and receives the help of his foster-son Aengus (also Oengus) to make her his new bride. Fuamnach&#x27;s vengeance is provoked against the young new wife, causing her a number of disgraces until after several transformations (including water, a worm, and a fly) Étaín fell into the drink of another woman and is reborn.

Étaín later marries Eochaid Airem, at that time the High King of Ireland. Far from giving up, Midir makes an attempt to bring his lover back home, going to see the king and challenging him to many games of fidchell or chess; Midir&#x27;s chessboard is described as being silver with golden men and jeweled corners. Eochaid wins all but the last game, and Midir gives him fifty horses with red, spotted heads, fifty boars, a vat of blackthorn, fifty gold hilted swords, fifty ivory hilted swords, fifty red eared cows with white eared calves, and fifty red-headed rams with three horns and three heads each. However, Midir wins the final game and requests a kiss from Étaín as his prize.

After defending his home against Midir, who effortlessly enters, Eochaid reluctantly allows Midir his kiss, but Midir turns himself and Étaín into swans who fly out of the royal residence. Eochaid refuses to accept the loss of his wife and pursues Midir to the elfmounds. When Eochaid finally begins excavating Bri Leith, Midir confronts him and offers him another game. Midir uses his power to make fifty women look like Étaín and offers the king the opportunity to choose only one. Eochaid incorrectly chooses his own daughter and loses Étaín forever, also fathering a daughter upon his own daughter in the process.

===&quot;Oidheadh Chlainne Lir&quot;===
In the &quot;Fate of the Children of Lir&quot;, Midir is referred to as &quot;Midhir the Proud&quot; and is passed over for the kingship of the Tuatha Dé Danann along with Lir, Aengus Og, and Ilbhreach in favor of Bodb Derg, the Dagda&#x27;s eldest son.

===&quot;Aigidecht Aitherni&quot;===
Midir figures in a brief anecdote about the stingy poet Athirne, son of Ferchertne, in the heroic age portrayed by the Ulster Cycle. The story, entitled &quot;Aigidecht Aitherni&quot; (&quot;The Guesting of Athirne&quot;) in one manuscript, recounts that Athirne came to Midir&#x27;s house in Brí Léith and fasted against him until he obtained Midir&#x27;s three magical cranes which stood outside his house denying entry or hospitality to anyone who approached. Moreover, &quot;[a]ny of the men of Ireland who saw them [the cranes] could not face equal combat on that day.&quot;

===Yellow Book of Lecan===
One of Midir&#x27;s eyes was knocked out with a twig of hazel during a quarrel that broke out between two companies of youths at the Brug. It is unclear in the story who threw the hazel twig, although Midir intercepted among the youths so that Aengus could avoid getting too close to Elcmar. Midir&#x27;s eye was healed by Dian Cecht, although elsewhere it is stated that Etain healed his eye from the well of Loch Da Lig.

===Other references===
Midir also interfered when Fráech attempted to woo Treblainne.

==In popular culture==

The video game &quot;Dark Souls III&quot; features a dragon boss by the name of Darkeater Midir. The video game &quot;Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War&quot; has a minor playable character named Midir in the first generation.
The videogame &quot;Final Fantasy 7&quot; the village mideel is a reference to this god.

<text>The Basin and Range Province is a vast physiographic region covering much of the inland Western United States and northwestern Mexico. It is defined by unique basin and range topography, characterized by abrupt changes in elevation, alternating between narrow faulted mountain chains and flat arid valleys or basins. The physiography of the province is the result of tectonic extension that began around 17 million years ago in the early Miocene epoch.

The numerous ranges within the province in the United States are collectively referred to as the &quot;Great Basin Ranges&quot;, although many are not actually in the Great Basin. Major ranges include the Snake Range, the Panamint Range, the White Mountains, and the Sandia Mountains. The highest point fully within the province is White Mountain Peak in California, while the lowest point is the Badwater Basin in Death Valley at . The province&#x27;s climate is arid, with numerous ecoregions. Most North American deserts are located within it.

The Basin and Range Province should not be confused with the Great Basin, a region defined by its unique hydrological characteristics (internal drainage) that overlaps much of the greater Basin and Range physiographic region. Nor should it be confused with the Basin and Range National Monument, located in Southern Nevada, which is one small part of the much larger province.

==Geography==
The Basin and Range Province includes much of western North America. In the United States, it is bordered on the west by the eastern fault scarp of the Sierra Nevada and spans over to its eastern border marked by the Wasatch Fault, the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande Rift. The province extends north to the Columbia Plateau and south as far as the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in Mexico, though the southern boundaries of the Basin and Range are debated. In Mexico, the Basin and Range Province is dominated by and largely synonymous with the Mexican Plateau.

Evidence suggests that the less-recognized southern portion of the province is bounded on the east by the Laramide Thrust Front of the Sierra Madre Oriental and on the west by the Gulf of California and Baja Peninsula with notably less faulting apparent in the Sierra Madre Occidental in the center of the southernmost Basin and Range Province.

Common geographic features include numerous endorheic basins, ephemeral lakes, plateaus, and bolson valleys alternating with mountains (as described below). The area is mostly arid and sparsely populated, although there are several major metropolitan areas, such as Reno, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso—Ciudad Juárez, Mexicali, and Hermosillo.

== Geology ==
It is generally accepted that basin and range topography is the result of extension and thinning of the lithosphere, which is composed of crust and upper mantle. Extensional environments like the Basin and Range are characterized by listric normal faulting, or faults that level out with depth. Opposing normal faults link at depth producing a horst and graben geometry, where horst refers to the upthrown fault block and graben to the down dropped fault block.

The average crustal thickness of the Basin and Range Province is approximately 30–35 km and is comparable to extended continental crust around the world. The crust in conjunction with the upper mantle comprises the lithosphere. The base of the lithosphere beneath the Basin and Range is estimated to be about 60–70 km. Opinions vary regarding the total extension of the region; however, the median estimate is about 100% total lateral extension. Total lateral displacement in the Basin and Range varies from 60 to 300 km since the onset of extension in the Early Miocene with the southern portion of the province representing a greater degree of displacement than the north. Evidence exists to suggest that extension initially began in the southern Basin and Range and propagated north over time.

Clarence Dutton famously compared the many narrow parallel mountain ranges that distinguish the unique topography of the Basin and Range to an &quot;army of caterpillars crawling northward.&quot;

===Tectonics===

The tectonic mechanisms responsible for lithospheric extension in the Basin and Range province are controversial, and several competing hypotheses attempt to explain them. Key events preceding Basin and Range extension in the western United States include a long period of compression due to the subduction of the Farallon plate under the west coast of the North American continental plate which stimulated the thickening of the crust. Most of the pertinent tectonic plate movement associated with the province occurred in the Neogene period (23.03-2.58 million years ago) and continues to the present. By the Early Miocene sub-epoch (23.03-15.97 million years ago), much of the Farallon plate had been consumed, and the seafloor spreading ridge that separated the Farallon plate from the Pacific plate (Pacific-Farallon Ridge) approached North America. In the Middle Miocene (15.97-11.63 million years ago), the Pacific-Farallon Ridge was subducted beneath North America ending subduction along this part of the Pacific margin; however, the Farallon plate continued to subduct into the mantle. The movement at this boundary divided the Pacific-Farallon Ridge and spawned the San Andreas transform fault, generating an oblique strike-slip component. Today, the Pacific plate moves north-westward relative to North America, a configuration which has given rise to increased shearing along the continental margin.

The tectonic activity responsible for the extension in the Basin and Range is a complex and controversial issue among the geoscience community. The most accepted hypothesis suggests that crustal shearing associated with the San Andreas Fault caused spontaneous extensional faulting similar to that seen in the Great Basin. However, plate movement alone does not account for the high elevation of the Basin and Range region. The western United States is a region of high heat flow which lowers the density of the lithosphere and stimulates isostatic uplift as a consequence. Lithospheric regions characterized by elevated heat flow are weak and extensional deformation can occur over a broad region. Basin and Range extension is therefore thought to be unrelated to the kind of extension produced by mantle upwelling which may cause narrow rift zones, such as those of the Afar triple junction. Geologic processes that elevate heat flow are varied, however some researchers suggest that heat generated at a subduction zone is transferred to the overriding plate as subduction proceeds. Fluids along fault zones then transfer heat vertically through the crust. This model has led to increasing interest in geothermal systems in the Basin and Range, and requires consideration of the continued influence of the fully subducted Farallon plate in the extension responsible for the Basin and Range Province.

===Metamorphic core complexes===
In some localities in the Basin and Range, metamorphic basement is visible at the surface. Some of these are metamorphic core complexes (MCC), an idea that was first developed based on studies in this province. A metamorphic core complex occurs when lower crust is brought to the surface as a result of extension. MCCs in the Basin and Range were not interpreted as being related to crustal extension until after the 1960s. Since then, similar deformational patterns have been identified in MCCs in the Basin and Range and has led geologists to examine them as a group of related geologic features formed by crustal extension during the Cenozoic era (66.0 million years ago to present). The study of metamorphic core complexes has provided valuable insight into the extensional processes driving Basin and Range formation.

=== Volcanism ===

Prior to the Eocene Epoch (55.8 ±0.2 to 33.9 ±0.1 Ma) the convergence rate of the Farallon and North American plates was fast, the angle of subduction was shallow, and the slab width was huge. During the Eocene the Farallon plate subduction-associated compressive forces of the Laramide, Sevier and Nevada orogenies ended, plate interactions changed from orthogonal compression to oblique strike-slip, and volcanism in the Basin and Range Province flared up (Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up). It is suggested that this plate continued to be underthrust until about 19 Ma, at which time it was completely consumed and volcanic activity ceased, in part. Olivine basalt from the oceanic ridge erupted around 17 Ma and extension began.

He played Dennis Patterson in the comedy-drama series &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; (1983–2004), Lesley Conroy in the sitcom &quot;Benidorm&quot; (2009–2018), and Gastric in the comedy series &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; (2014–2019).

==Early life==
Timothy Malcolm Healy was born in the Benwell area of Newcastle upon Tyne on 29 January 1952, the son of Sadie (née Wilson) and Timothy Malcolm Healy Sr. 

He grew up in Ouston, County Durham, west of Birtley, Tyne and Wear, in former Chester-le-Street (district). He attended Pelton Secondary Modern School in Pelton, County Durham.

He worked as a welder in a factory and joined the British Army, serving part-time in the 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment. In 1973 he successfully responded to an advert for the Northern Arts School, obtaining a student grant and moving into acting. He was an early member of the Live Theatre Company, a touring company that put on drama productions in community halls and working men&#x27;s clubs.

==Career==
In 1982, Healy appeared in &quot;A Captain&#x27;s Tale&quot;, depicting the triumph of West Auckland F.C. in the Sir Thomas Lipton Cup. In 1983, Healy was brought to public attention for his role in &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; a TV comedy drama series about British builders working in Germany.

In 1984 Healy appeared in the &quot;Minder&quot; episode &quot;A Star is Gorn&quot;, in which he played George, an enforcer for Cyril Ash, a crooked music agent.

During the mid-80s, Healy also played Barney Bodger, the blundering handyman in the Children&#x27;s ITV series &quot;Tickle on the Tum&quot;, becoming a favourite with young viewers.

In the early-1990s, he appeared as a cockney ex-pat in the BBC series &quot;Boys From The Bush&quot; and played a binman in &quot;Common as Muck&quot;. In 1994, he appeared in one episode of the fourth series of Heartbeat, he played Cedric Shanks. In 2001, Healy appeared in the surreal BBC situation comedy &quot;Breeze Block&quot;, playing the head of a strange family. Healy had high hopes for the series, but was reportedly upset when it was only screened on the digital channel BBC Choice (later relaunched as BBC Three) and never broadcast on BBC One or BBC Two. He starred as a folk musician in the first episode of comedy series, &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;. His band, &quot;Half a Shilling&quot;, sang a song called &quot;Send the Buggers Back&quot;, supposedly about a pair of Holy Communion shoes, but clearly intended as a racist anthem. He played Jackie Elliot in the West End musical &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;.

Healy appeared in the film &quot;Purely Belter&quot; as the abusive father of delinquent teenager Gerry and appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Paul Jones, the father of barman Sean Tully. Healy previously appeared on the show in 1976 as a bingo caller. In 2002, Healy appeared as DS Philip Carter in an episode of &quot;Silent Witness&quot;. 2003, Healy appeared as Inspector Colin Duggan in an episode of the BBC drama &quot;Murder in Mind&quot;. In 2009, Healy appeared in the BBC drama &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; as a Security Guard, Dave Miller, a love interest for Steph Haydock, played by his wife at the time, Denise Welch. In 2013, Healy appeared as Eric in the Sky Living Sitcom &quot;The Spa&quot; for one series.

When Healy&#x27;s ex wife, Denise Welch, was a guest on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;, an apparently aged man came on the show to talk about a subject. He sounded unwell while Welch was speaking, and to her and everyone&#x27;s surprise, he revealed himself to be Healy. Healy starred in the third series of the ITV comedy &quot;Benidorm&quot; playing a cross dresser called Lesley. He later became a regular in the fourth series in 2011.

Healy has also had a role in Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer&#x27;s show &quot;Catterick&quot; as a helpful man with a chronically cold wife. In November 2013, he filmed a cameo in the first episode of the second series of the BBC sitcom &quot;Hebburn&quot;.

In September 2009, Healy became the voice of The Greener Company – a wood-burning stove company based in Lymm, Cheshire. Working in conjunction with The Greener Company and Smooth FM, Healy plays the role of David – The Wood-Burning Stove fitter for The Greener Company. David is a character in a series of radio commercials used to promote the company. 

He played Gastric in &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; (2014–2019).

==Personal life==
Healy married actress Denise Welch in 1988. They had two sons before divorcing in 2012; their older son, Matty, is the lead singer of the band The 1975.

<doc id="246017" wikidata="Q2459429" url="?curid=246017" title="Tulare Lake">
<text>Tulare Lake () or Tache Lake (Yokuts: &quot;Pah-áh-su&quot;, &quot;Pah-áh-sē&quot;) is a freshwater lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California, United States. Historically, Tulare Lake was once the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River in surface area. For thousands of years, from the Paleolithic onward, Tulare Lake was a uniquely rich area, which supported perhaps the largest population of Native Americans north of present-day Mexico.

In the second half of the 19th century, Tulare Lake was dried up by diverting its tributary rivers for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses. In modern times, it is usually a dry lake with residual wetlands and marshes. The lake reappears during unusually high levels of rainfall or snow melt as it did in 1942, 1969, 1983, 1997, 1998, and 2023.

==Name==

The Spanish word &quot;&quot; (plural: &quot;&quot;) refers to a field of tule rush. Spanish captain Pedro Fages led the first excursions to the southern San Joaquin Valley in 1773.

This plain will exceed one hundred and twenty leagues in length and in parts is twenty, fifteen and even less in width. It is all a labyrinth of lakes and &quot;tulares&quot;, and the river San Francisco, divided into several branches, winding in the middle of the plain, now enters and now flows out of the lakes, until very near to the place where it enters into the estuary of the river.
&quot;Tulare&quot; ultimately derives from Classical Nahuatl &quot;&quot;, &quot;rush&quot; or &quot;reeds&quot;. The name is thus cognate with various Mesoamerican sites, such as Tula and Tultepec.

A Tachi name of the lake is &quot;Pa&#x27;ashi&quot; which translates to &quot;big water&quot;. Other variants include Chentache (or Chintache) and Chataqui.

==Geologic history==

Before 600,000 years ago, Lake Corcoran covered the Central Valley of California. 600,000 years ago a new outlet formed in the present day San Francisco Bay, rapidly carving an outlet through Carquinez Strait, probably catastrophically, and drained the lake, leaving the Buena Vista, Kern and Tulare Lakes as remnants.
The lake was part of a partially endorheic basin, at the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, where it received water from the Kern, Tule, and Kaweah Rivers, as well as from southern distributaries of the Kings.

It was separated from the rest of the San Joaquin Valley by tectonic subsidence and alluvial fans extending out from Los Gatos Creek in the Coast Ranges and the Kings River in the Sierra Nevada. Above a threshold elevation of , it overflowed northward into the then-extant Summit Lake (southwest of Riverdale), thence via Fresno Slough to the San Joaquin River. This happened in 19 of 29 years from 1850 to 1878. No overflows occurred after 1878 due to increasing diversions of tributary waters for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses. By 1899, the lake was dry except for residual wetlands and occasional floods.

==Geography==
Tulare Lake was the largest of several lakes in its lower basin. Most of the Kern River&#x27;s flow first went into Kern Lake and Buena Vista Lake via the Kern River and Kern River Slough southwest and south of the site of Bakersfield. If they overflowed, it was through the Kern River channel northwest through tule marshland and Goose Lake, into Tulare Lake.

===Islands===
During times of high water, the ridge of high ground separating the upper Chintache basin from the lower Tontache basin became an archipelago in the southern part of the lake. During times of low water, this ridge created two separate lakes. Today, these former islands make up the Sand Ridge in Kings County.

The largest of these islands, Atwell&#x27;s Island, was originally known as Hog-Root Island or Root Island. It was owned by Allen J. Atwell of Visalia, California, who introduced hogs onto the island. In early history, it was the site of the Wowol village, Chawlowin. Today the city of Alpaugh, California, sits on the remnants of Atwell&#x27;s Island. Atwell Island was the largest of the Tulare Lake archipelago and has the latest recorded habitation by indigenous peoples. A Bird Island is shown in an 1876 map at the tip of Atwell Island&#x27;s &#x27;teardrop&#x27; shape which shows a small, oblate island.
A Wowol village on Atwell&#x27;s Island was named Chawlowin. It was occupied after 1852 by refugee Yokuts natives. Yoimut described semi-traditional life at Chawlowin:
My mother found almost all of her relations there at Chawlowin. Her brother had his family there and two or three of her uncles were there, too. They had all come back to that camp from Tule River Reservation, where the soldiers had taken them from Téjon Ranch. They wanted to stay at their old home. These people did not go back to the old village at the mouth of Deer Creek and White River because they would come back and get them. They were hid in the tules in tumlus (&quot;toom-loos&quot;) houses at the north side of the Island.
Gull Island was a small islet at the mouth of the Tule River, extending westward from the south bank of the Tule River. It was a narrow bar which was low, muddy, and had no vegetation. It was named for the large number of gulls which nested at the site.

Pelican Island was formed from deposits of the Kings River as an extension of its east channel, about a mile long and ten to sixty feet wide in 1883. It was named, as with Gull Island, for the vast number of white pelicans that nested on there. Cormorants also were present.

Skull Island extended between five and six miles and was just over half a mile wide, the highest part being about twenty feet above the lakebed. Skull Island is one of the more locally famous landmarks. Frank F. Latta identifies it with the Calaveres of the early Spanish settlers. Yoimut (Josie Alonzo) described a village, &quot;Witi&#x27;tsolo wın&quot;, probably on or near the site, to Anna Hadwick Gayton, which she visited between 1860 and 1870. 

Throughout the 19th century it was common for settlers in the Central Valley to raid Skull Island. Dr. William Ferguson Cartmill, who numerous streets are named after in Tulare County, took several skulls from the site and kept them in his house.
Local legend holds of a great &quot;Indian battle&quot; that took place at Skull Island. It is far more likely that the mass grave on Skull Island was due to an epidemic, probably smallpox.
==Ecology==
===Flora ===
Native ecosystems of the region ranged from saltbrush scrub and alkali sink to valley grassland and wetland. Today, alfalfa is grown on some parts of the southern basin and invasive saltcedar is recorded in natural habitats.
=== Fauna ===
Indigenous fauna of the Sand Ridge area include Buena Vista Lake shrew (&quot;Sorex ornatus relictus&quot;), southwestern pond turtle (&quot;Actinemys pallida&quot;), fulvous whistling duck (&quot;Dendrocygna bicolor&quot;), least bittern (&quot;Ixobrychus exilis&quot;), California red-legged frog (&quot;Rana aurora draytonii&quot;), giant garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis gigas&quot;). and the extinct Thicktail chub fish.

Other species native or present in the area are sandhill cranes and tricolored blackbird. Historically attested species (sometimes present in nearby placenames) like the tule elk and pronghorn antelope were of economic importance to Native American peoples living in the area. Grizzly Adams hunted tule elk on Pelican Island in the 1850s.

The re-emergence of the lake can lead to explosions of the mosquito population in the area, which raises the concern of mosquito borne illness for people living in the area.

==History==
===Pre colonial===
The Tulare Lake region has been continually inhabited for more than 10,000 years. The Witt Site, on the shores of Tulare Lake, has yielded fluted and stemmed points from Paleoindian cultures, flaked stone crescents, Pinto points, drills, and limaces or &quot;humpies.&quot; Fragmented mineralized bone have been identified as horse (&quot;Equus&quot;), bison (&quot;Bison&quot;), ground sloth (&quot;Paramylodon&quot;), and mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus&quot;) or mastodon (&quot;Mammut&quot;).

The Sand Ridge area has similarly been occupied since at least the late Pleistocene. According to the Bureau of Land Management, Sand Ridge &quot;has yielded artifacts spanning the entire cultural horizon in California.&quot; Historical research by William Preston suggests that European-introduced epidemics may have devastated Lake Indians as early as 1500.

At the point of European contact, three Yokuts nations inhabited the Tulare Lake area. The Wowol, to the southern margin, the Chunut to the east, and the Tachi to the north and west.

===Early Spanish expeditions===
European exploration into the Tulare Basin area began in 1805 with Fr. Juan Martin, who was the first European to see the lake. He arrived in Wowol territory following a three-day trip from the coast.

In 1816, Luís Antonio Martinez destroyed the rancheria of Bubal, burning the village, scattering their grain, and smashing their grinding stones. He was heavily criticized for his cruelty by Father Juan Cabot, who was present on the expedition.

===Pestilence of 1833===
According to Frank F. Latta, there was an epidemic around 1833 that wiped out nearly the entire western San Joaquin Valley:

 At least three centenarians among my Yokuts informants were children here at that time. They were able to verify the existence of such an occurrence and to give me some account of it: burial of dead bodies until there were not enough survivors to make burials; abandonment of village sites, fleeing to the mountains, and later, studying the general condition of the valley floor and foothills until the Mewalk them safe for reoccupation. These centarians were Pahmit, San Joaquin River Dumna; Sahn-e-hat, Tule River Yaudanche, and To-tu-yah, Yosemite Valley Mewalk. Totuyah and Pahmit actually knew of the Mewalk moving down into the vacant Yokuts territory.

Skull Island was probably a result of this epidemic, as Latta&#x27;s informants specifically note that bodies were too high in quantity for the living to bury them.

Two Mexican land grants were claimed in 1843, one between Kings River and Cross Creek, and another, Manuel Castro&#x27;s Rancho Laguna de Tache on the north bank of the Kings River. John C. Frémont led a United States military expedition across California, including Tulare Lake, immediately before the Mexican-American War.

===American===
United States settlers began entering the Tulare Basin in 1826. The first settler to enter the San Joaquin Valley was Jedediah Smith. 
In 1854, Grizzly Adams hunted on Pelican Island, &quot;where there was said to be elk in abundance.&quot; Children from a village on the mouth of the Kings River guided him to the island on a canoe made of tules. In 1858 or 1859, settlers began ethnically cleansing Tulare Lake, by killing or forcibly relocating the majority of the Yokuts population. Severe floods in 1861 and 1867 killed thousands of cattle and caused settlers to request further dams on the inflows to Tulare Lake. From 1875 to 1877, large numbers of hogs and cattle were carried to Skull Island from the mainland on the &quot;Mose Andross&quot;.
Presumably the last autonomous Indigenous people lived at the Tulare Lake archipelago in the 1870s. Yoimut detailed white settlers introducing cattle to the island and subsequently forcing the indigenous people out:

While we were at Chawlowin some white men put cattle on the island. The water was low and they drove them across from the east. There were hogs there already, but they were wild. As soon as the white people found out we were there we began to have trouble. The tules were getting dry and we were afraid the white people would burn us out. So we all left. My mother and stepfather took us to Téjon Ranch. We went in his brother&#x27;s little wagon.
===Desiccation===


In the wake of the United States Civil War, late 19th-century settlers drained the surrounding marshes for agriculture. In 1884, Scottish travel writer Constance Gordon-Cumming warned that &quot;[e]ven the great Tulare lake itself is in danger of being gradually absorbed by the numerous canals and ditches with which the whole country is now being intersected...[t]he poor lakes have simply been left to starve—the rivers, whose surplus waters hitherto fed them, having now been bridled and led away in ditches and canals to feed the great wheat-fields.&quot; 

That same year, &quot;Scientific American&quot; predicted the &quot;utter absorption&quot; of Tulare Lake.
The Kaweah, Kern, Kings, and Tule Rivers were dammed upstream in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which turned their headwaters into a system of reservoirs. In the San Joaquin Valley, the state and counties built canals to deliver that water and divert the remaining flows for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses. Tulare Lake was nearly dry by the early 20th century.

Swedish naturalist Gustav Eisen, who crossed the lake by steamboat in 1878 and undertook an excavation of Sand Ridge probably that same year, celebrated the desiccation. He wrote,

In my opinion the drying up of Tulare Lake is a good thing. The land will be good for crops and there will be less sickness in the vicinity. The sloughs and marsh land in the old days used to be full of malaria that will now be a thing of the past.

Skull Island, surrounded by wheat fields, was eventually raided by grave robbers.

===Post-1930===
Enough water remained that the Alameda Naval Air Station used Tulare Lake as an outlying seaplane base during World War II and the early years of the Cold War. Flying boats could land on Tulare Lake when landing conditions were unsafe on San Francisco Bay.

The lake bed became a shallow basin of fertile soil, within the Central Valley of California, the most productive agricultural region of the United States. Farms in the basin produce much of the country&#x27;s cotton, tomatoes, pistachios, almonds, walnuts, alfalfa, wheat, barley and cow milk. Farmers have irrigated the area for a century, so soil salination is becoming a concern. The destruction of the terrestrial wetlands and the lake ecosystem habitats resulted in substantial losses of terrestrial animals, plants, aquatic animals, water plants, and resident and migrating birds.

=== Resurgence ===
Yoimut, who spent a significant part of her life on the lake, warned ethnographer Frank F. Latta that the lake would return. In 1938 and 1955, the lake flooded, which prompted the construction of the Terminus and Success Dams on the Kaweah and Tule Rivers in Tulare County and Pine Flat Dam on the Kings River in Fresno County. Although usually dry, the lake reappears during floods following unusually high levels of rainfall or snow melt; for this reason, it has been called a &quot;phantom lake,&quot; &quot;the lake that will not die,&quot; or California’s zombie lake. Estimates have found that Tulare Lake could hold twice the water of the proposed Temperance Flat Dam at one-fifth the cost. The Tachi Yokuts and many other people and organizations are trying to restore the lake permanently for various reasons including environmental purposes, water storage and Native American land reclaiming.
The lake reappeared in 1942, 1969, 1983, 1997, 1998, and 2023. In 1983, the lake took two years to dry out. In June 1998, an above-normal winter snowfall led to the lake reappearing, reaching a size of , which resulted in about $100 million worth of crop damage and losses.

The groundwater in recent years has been overpumped by the large land owners that dominate the politics and economy of the Tulare Lake region. The overpumping has contributed to the sinking of the ground under Corcoran, as well as exacerbated the dangers of flooding and necessitated the construction of multimillion-dollar levees.
===2023 resurgence===
The numerous storms that struck California during the first few months of 2023 resulted in the reappearance of over of the lake, forcing the evacuation of several communities and causing the flooding of hundreds of farm buildings and homes amidst the land farmed by agricultural operations on the former lakebed. Parts of the communities of Alpaugh and Allensworth were under evacuation orders due to concerns that they might become flooded. Some floodwaters were diverted to alleviate flooding on farms. The Kern National Wildlife Refuge received its full water allocation in 2023. Located about south, the wetlands provide habitat for birds as part of the Pacific Flyway. As of February 1, 2024, the water only covered 4,532 acres of farmland.

== In popular culture ==
In 1967, a documentary film about the J.G. Boswell Company’s achievements and variety of California&#x27;s agricultural industry titled &quot;The Big Land&quot; directed by David H. Vowell was released.

TV personality Huell Howser visited Tulare Lake in an episode of his show, &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot;, in 1999.

In 2003, author Mark Arax published a book titled &quot;The King of California&quot; which is about how J.G. Boswell turned the lakebed into farms and revolutionized the farming industry.

In 2015, a documentary titled &quot;Tulare, the Phantom Lake: Drought&quot; was released and in 2022, a second part to the same documentary was released. They were both directed and produced by Christopher Beaver.

In 2024, author Greg Collins published a book about the lake titled &quot;Seven Generations; the Past, Present, and Future of the Tulare Lake Basin&quot;.

<text>An alluvial fan is an accumulation of sediments that fans outwards from a concentrated source of sediments, such as a narrow canyon emerging from an escarpment. They are characteristic of mountainous terrain in arid to semiarid climates, but are also found in more humid environments subject to intense rainfall and in areas of modern glaciation. They range in area from less than to almost .

Alluvial fans typically form where flow emerges from a confined channel and is free to spread out and infiltrate the surface. This reduces the carrying capacity of the flow and results in deposition of sediments. The flow can take the form of infrequent debris flows or one or more ephemeral or perennial streams.

Alluvial fans are common in the geologic record, such as in the Triassic basins of eastern North America and the New Red Sandstone of south Devon. Such fan deposits likely contain the largest accumulations of gravel in the geologic record. Alluvial fans have also been found on Mars and Titan, showing that fluvial processes have occurred on other worlds.

Some of the largest alluvial fans are found along the Himalaya mountain front on the Indo-Gangetic plain. A shift of the feeder channel (a &quot;nodal avulsion&quot;) can lead to catastrophic flooding, as occurred on the Kosi River fan in 2008.

== Description ==

An alluvial fan is an accumulation of sediments that fans out from a concentrated source of sediments, such as a narrow canyon emerging from an escarpment. This accumulation is shaped like a section of a shallow cone, with its apex at the source of sediments.

Alluvial fans vary greatly in size, from only a few meters across at the base to as much as 150 kilometers across, with a slope of 1.5 to 25 degrees. Some giant alluvial fans have areas of almost . The slope measured from the apex is generally concave, with the steepest slope near the apex (the &quot;proximal fan&quot; or &quot;fanhead&quot;) and becoming less steep further out (the &quot;medial fan&quot; or &quot;midfan&quot;) and shallowing at the edges of the fan (the &quot;distal fan&quot; or &quot;outer fan&quot;). &quot;Sieve deposits&quot;, which are lobes of coarse gravel, may be present on the proximal fan. The sediments in an alluvial fan are usually coarse and poorly sorted, with the coarsest sediments found on the proximal fan.
When there is enough space in the alluvial plain for all of the sediment deposits to fan out without contacting other valley walls or rivers, an unconfined alluvial fan develops. Unconfined alluvial fans allow sediments to naturally fan out, and the shape of the fan is not influenced by other topological features. When the alluvial plain is more restricted, so that the fan comes into contact with topographic barriers, a confined fan is formed.

Wave or channel erosion of the edge of the fan (&quot;lateral erosion&quot;) sometimes produces a &quot;toe-trimmed&quot; fan, in which the edge of the fan is marked by a small escarpment. Toe-trimmed fans may record climate changes or tectonic processes, and the process of lateral erosion may enhance the aquifer or petroleum reservoir potential of the fan. Toe-trimmed fans on the planet Mars provide evidence of past river systems.

When numerous rivers and streams exit a mountain front onto a plain, the fans can combine to form a continuous apron. This is referred to as a &quot;bajada&quot; or &quot;piedmont alluvial plain&quot;.

==Formation==
Alluvial fans usually form where a confined feeder channel exits a mountain front or a glacier margin. As the flow exits the feeder channel onto the fan surface, it is able to spread out into wide, shallow channels or to infiltrate the surface. This reduces the carrying power of the flow and results in deposition of sediments.
Flow in the proximal fan, where the slope is steepest, is usually confined to a single channel (a &quot;fanhead trench&quot;), which may be up to deep. This channel is subject to blockage by accumulated sediments or debris flows, which causes flow to periodically break out of its old channel (&quot;nodal avulsion&quot;) and shift to a part of the fan with a steeper gradient, where deposition resumes. As a result, normally only part of the fan is active at any particular time, and the bypassed areas may undergo soil formation or erosion.

Alluvial fans can be dominated by debris flows (&quot;debris flow fans&quot;) or stream flow (&quot;fluvial fans&quot;). Which kind of fan is formed is controlled by climate,tectonics, and the type of bedrock in the area feeding the flow onto the fan.

===Debris flow===
Debris flow fans receive most of their sediments in the form of debris flows. Debris flows are slurry-like mixtures of water and particles of all sizes, from clay to boulders, that resemble wet concrete. They are characterized by having a yield strength, meaning that they are highly viscous at low flow velocities but become less viscous as the flow velocity increases. This means that a debris flow can come to a halt while still on moderately tilted ground. The flow then becomes consolidated under its own weight.

Debris flow fans occur in all climates but are more common where the source rock is mudstone or matrix-rich saprolite rather than coarser, more permeable regolith. The abundance of fine-grained sediments encourages the initial hillslope failure and subsequent cohesive flow of debris. Saturation of clay-rich colluvium by locally intense thunderstorms initiates slope failure. The resulting debris flow travels down the feeder channel and onto the surface of the fan.

Debris flow fans have a network of mostly inactive distributary channels in the upper fan that gives way to mid- to lower-level lobes. The channels tend to be filled by subsequent cohesive debris flows. Usually only one lobe is active at a time, and inactive lobes may develop desert varnish or develop a soil profile from eolian dust deposition, on time scales of 1,000 to 10,000 years. Because of their high viscosity, debris flows tend to be confined to the proximal and medial fan even in a debris-flow-dominated alluvial fan, and streamfloods dominate the distal fan. However, some debris-flow-dominated fans in arid climates consist almost entirely of debris flows and lag gravels from eolian winnowing of debris flows, with no evidence of sheetflood or sieve deposits. Debris-flow-dominated fans tend to be steep and poorly vegetated.

===Fluvial===
Fluvial fans (streamflow-dominated fans) receive most of their sediments in the form of stream flow rather than debris flows. They are less sharply distinguished from ordinary fluvial deposits than are debris flow fans.

Fluvial fans occur where there is perennial, seasonal, or ephemeral stream flow that feeds a system of distributary channels on the fan. In arid or semiarid climates, deposition is dominated by infrequent but intense rainfall that produces flash floods in the feeder channel. This results in &quot;sheetfloods&quot; on the alluvial fan, where sediment-laden water leaves its channel confines and spreads across the fan surface. These may include hyperconcentrated flows containing 20% to 45% sediments, which are intermediate between sheetfloods having 20% or less of sediments and debris flows with more than 45% sediments. As the flood recedes, it often leaves a lag of gravel deposits that have the appearance of a network of braided streams.

Where the flow is more continuous, as with spring snow melt, &quot;incised-channel flow&quot; in channels high takes place in a network of braided streams. Such alluvial fans tend to have a shallower slope but can become enormous. The Kosi and other fans along the Himalaya mountain front in the Indo-Gangetic plain are examples of gigantic stream-flow-dominated alluvial fans, sometimes described as &quot;megafans&quot;. Here, continued movement on the Main Boundary Thrust over the last ten million years has focused the drainage of of mountain frontage into just three enormous fans.

==Geologic record==

Alluvial fans are common in the geologic record, but may have been particularly important before the evolution of land plants in the mid-Paleozoic. They are characteristic of fault-bounded basins and can be or thicker due to tectonic subsidence of the basin and uplift of the mountain front. Most are red from hematite produced by diagenetic alteration of iron-rich minerals in a shallow, oxidizing environment. Examples of paleofans include the Triassic basins of eastern North America and the New Red Sandstone of south Devon, the Devonian Hornelen Basin of Norway, and the Devonian-Carboniferous in the Gaspé Peninsula of Canada. Such fan deposit likely contain the largest accumulations of gravel in the geologic record.

=== Depositional facies ===
Several kinds of sediment deposits (&quot;facies&quot;) are found in alluvial fans.

Alluvial fans are characterized by coarse sedimentation, though the sediments making up the fan become less coarse further from the apex. Gravels show well-developed imbrication with the pebbles dipping towards the apex. Fan deposits typically show well-developed reverse grading caused by outbuilding of the fan: Finer sediments are deposited at the edge of the fan, but as the fan continues to grow, increasingly coarse sediments are deposited on top of the earlier, less coarse sediments. However, a few fans show normal grading indicating inactivity or even fan retreat, so that increasingly fine sediments are deposited on earlier coarser sediments. Normal or reverse grading sequences can be hundreds to thousands of meters in thickness. Depositional facies that have been reported for alluvial fans include debris flows, sheet floods and upper regime stream floods, sieve deposits, and braided stream flows, each leaving their own characteristic sediment deposits that can be identified by geologists.

Debris flow deposits are common in the proximal and medial fan. These deposits lack sedimentary structure, other than occasional reverse-graded bedding towards the base, and they are poorly sorted. The proximal fan may also include gravel lobes that have been interpreted as sieve deposits, where runoff rapidly infiltrates and leaves behind only the coarse material. However, the gravel lobes have also been interpreted as debris flow deposits. Conglomerate originating as debris flows on alluvial fans is described as &quot;fanglomerate&quot;.

Stream flow deposits tend to be sheetlike, better sorted than debris flow deposits, and sometimes show well-developed sedimentary structures such as cross-bedding. These are more prevalent in the medial and distal fan. In the distal fan, where channels are very shallow and braided, stream flow deposits consist of sandy interbeds with planar and trough slanted stratification. The medial fan of a streamflow-dominated alluvial fan shows nearly the same depositional facies as ordinary fluvial environments, so that identification of ancient alluvial fans must be based on radial paleomorphology in a piedmont setting.

==Occurrences==
Alluvial fans are characteristic of mountainous terrain in arid to semiarid climates, but are also found in more humid environments subject to intense rainfall and in areas of modern glaciation. They have also been found on other bodies of the Solar System.

===Terrestrial===
Alluvial fans are built in response to erosion induced by tectonic uplift. The upwards coarsening of the beds making up the fan reflects cycles of erosion in the highlands that feed sediments to the fan. However, climate and changes in base level may be as important as tectonic uplift. For example, alluvial fans in the Himalayas show older fans entrenched and overlain by younger fans. The younger fans, in turn, are cut by deep incised valleys showing two terrace levels. Dating via optically stimulated luminescence suggests a hiatus of 70,000 to 80,000 years between the old and new fans, with evidence of tectonic tilting at 45,000 years ago and an end to fan deposition 20,000 years ago. Both the hiatus and the more recent end to fan deposition are thought to be connected to periods of enhanced southwest monsoon precipitation. Climate has also influenced fan formation in Death Valley, California, US, where dating of beds suggests that peaks of fan deposition during the last 25,000 years occurred during times of rapid climate change, both from wet to dry and from dry to wet.

Alluvial fans are often found in desert areas, which are subjected to periodic flash floods from nearby thunderstorms in local hills. The typical watercourse in an arid climate has a large, funnel-shaped basin at the top, leading to a narrow defile, which opens out into an alluvial fan at the bottom. Multiple braided streams are usually present and active during water flows. Phreatophytes (plants with long tap roots capable of reaching a deep water table) are sometimes found in sinuous lines radiating from arid climate fan toes. These &quot;fan-toe phreatophyte strips&quot; trace buried channels of coarse sediments from the fan that have interfingered with impermeable playa sediments.

Alluvial fans also develop in wetter climates when high-relief terrain is located adjacent to low-relief terrain. In Nepal, the Koshi River has built a megafan covering some below its exit from Himalayan foothills onto the nearly level plains where the river traverses into India before joining the Ganges. 
Along the upper Koshi tributaries, tectonic forces elevate the Himalayas several millimeters annually. Uplift is approximately in equilibrium with erosion, so the river annually carries some of sediment as it exits the mountains. Deposition of this magnitude over millions of years is more than sufficient to account for the megafan.

In North America, streams flowing into California&#x27;s Central Valley have deposited smaller but still extensive alluvial fans, such as that of the Kings River flowing out of the Sierra Nevada. Like the Himalayan megafans, these are streamflow-dominated fans.

===Extraterrestrial===
====Mars====
Alluvial fans are also found on Mars. Unlike alluvial fans on Earth, those on Mars are rarely associated with tectonic processes, but are much more common on crater rims. The crater rim alluvial fans appear to have been deposited by sheetflow rather than debris flows.

Three alluvial fans have been found in Saheki Crater. These fans confirmed past fluvial flow on the planet and further supported the theory that liquid water was once present in some form on the Martian surface. In addition, observations of fans in Gale crater made by satellites from orbit have now been confirmed by the discovery of fluvial sediments by the Curiosity rover. Alluvial fans in Holden crater have toe-trimmed profiles attributed to fluvial erosion.

The few alluvial fans associated with tectonic processes include those at Coprates Chasma and Juventae Chasma, which are part of the Valles Marineris canyon system. These provide evidence of the existence and nature of faulting in this region of Mars.

====Titan====

Alluvial fans have been observed by the Cassini-Huygens mission on Titan using the Cassini orbiter&#x27;s synthetic aperture radar instrument. These fans are more common in the drier mid-latitudes at the end of methane/ethane rivers where it is thought that frequent wetting and drying occur due to precipitation, much like arid fans on Earth. Radar imaging suggests that fan material is most likely composed of round grains of water ice or solid organic compounds about two centimeters in diameter.

==Impact on humans==
Alluvial fans are the most important groundwater reservoirs in many regions. Many urban, industrial, and agricultural areas are located on alluvial fans, including the conurbations of Los Angeles, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Denver, Colorado, in the western United States, and in many other parts of the world. However, flooding on alluvial fans poses unique problems for disaster prevention and preparation.

===Aquifers===

The beds of coarse sediments associated with alluvial fans form aquifers that are the most important groundwater reservoirs in many regions. These include both arid regions, such as Egypt or Iraq, and humid regions, such as central Europe or Taiwan.

===Flood hazards===
Alluvial fans are subject to infrequent but often very damaging flooding, whose unusual characteristics distinguish alluvial fan floods from ordinary riverbank flooding. These include great uncertainty in the likely flood path, the likelihood of abrupt deposition and erosion of sediments carried by the flood from upstream sources, and a combination of the availability of sediments and of the slope and topography of the fan that creates extraordinary hazards. These hazards cannot reliably be mitigated by elevation on fill (raising existing buildings up to a meter (three feet) and building new foundations beneath them). At a minimum, major structural flood control measures are required to mitigate risk, and in some cases, the only alternative is to restrict development on the fan surface. Such measures can be politically controversial, particularly since the hazard is not obvious to property owners. In the United States, areas at risk of alluvial fan flooding are marked as Zone AO on flood insurance rate maps.

Alluvial fan flooding commonly takes the form of short (several hours) but energetic flash floods that occur with little or no warning. They typically result from heavy and prolonged rainfall, and are characterized by high velocities and capacity for sediment transport. Flows cover the range from floods through hyperconcentrated flows to debris flows, depending on the volume of sediments in the flow. Debris flows resemble freshly poured concrete, consisting mostly of coarse debris. Hyperconcentrated flows are intermediate between floods and debris flows, with a water content between 40 and 80 weight percent. Floods may transition to hyperconcentrated flows as they entrain sediments, while debris flows may become hyperconcentrated flows if they are diluted by water. Because flooding on alluvial fans carries large quantities of sediment, channels can rapidly become blocked, creating great uncertainty about flow paths that magnifies the dangers.

Alluvial fan flooding in the Apennine Mountains of Italy have resulted in repeated loss of life. A flood on 1 October 1581 at Piedimonte Matese resulted in the loss of 400 lives. Loss of life from alluvial fan floods continued into the 19th century, and the hazard of alluvial fan flooding remains a concern in Italy.

On January 1, 1934, record rainfall in a recently burned area of the San Gabriel Mountains, California, caused severe flooding of the alluvial fan on which the towns of Montrose and Glendale were built. The floods caused significant loss of life and property.

The Koshi River in India has built up a megafan where it exits the Himalayas onto the Ganges plain. The river has a history of frequently and capriciously changing its course, so that it has been called the &quot;Sorrow of Bihar&quot; for contributing disproportionately to India&#x27;s death tolls in flooding. These exceed those of all countries except Bangladesh. Over the last few hundred years, the river had generally shifted westward across its fan, and by 2008, the main river channel was located on the extreme western part of the megafan. In August 2008, high monsoon flows breached the embankment of the Koshi River. This diverted most of the river into an unprotected ancient channel and flooded the central part of the megafan. This was an area with a high population density that had been stable for over 200 years. Over a million people were rendered homeless, about a thousand lost their lives and thousands of hectares of crops were destroyed.

===Petroleum reservoirs===
Buried alluvial fans are sometimes found at the margins of petroleum basins. Debris flow fans make poor petroleum reservoirs, but fluvial fans are potentially significant reservoirs. Though fluvial fans are typically of poorer quality than reservoirs closer to the basin center, due to their complex structure, the episodic flooding channels of the fans are potentially lucrative targets for petroleum exploration. Alluvial fans that experience toe-trimming (lateral erosion) by an axial river (a river running the length of an escarpment-bounded basin) may have increased potential as reservoirs. The river deposits relatively porous, permeable axial river sediments that alternate with fan sediment beds.

<doc id="246019" wikidata="Q861025" url="?curid=246019" title="Elastic-rebound theory">
<text>In geology, the elastic-rebound theory is an explanation for how energy is released during an earthquake.

As the Earth&#x27;s crust deforms, the rocks which span the opposing sides of a fault are subjected to shear stress. Slowly they deform, until their internal rigidity is exceeded. Then they separate with a rupture along the fault; the sudden movement releases accumulated energy, and the rocks snap back almost to their original shape. The previously solid mass is divided between the two slowly moving plates, the energy released through the surroundings in a seismic wave.

== Theory ==
After the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, geophysicist Harry Fielding Reid examined the displacement of the ground surface along the San Andreas Fault in the 50 years before the earthquake. He found evidence for 3.2 m of bending during that period. He concluded that the quake must have been the result of the elastic rebound of the strain energy stored in the rocks on either side of the fault. Later measurements using the global positioning system largely support Reid&#x27;s theory as the basis of seismic movement.

==Explanation==
The two sides of an active but locked fault are slowly moving in different directions, where elastic strain energy builds up in any rock mass that adjoins them. Thus, if a road is built straight across the fault as in Time 1 of the figure panel, it is perpendicular to the fault trace at point E, where the fault is locked. The overall fault movement (large arrows) causes the rocks across the locked fault to accrue elastic deformation, as in Time 2. This deformation may build at the rate of a few centimeters per year. When the accumulated strain is great enough to overcome the strength of the rocks, the result is a sudden break, or a springing back to the original shape as much as possible, a jolt which is felt on the surface as an earthquake. This sudden movement results in the shift of the roadway&#x27;s surface, as shown in Time 3. The stored energy is released partly as heat, partly in alteration of the rock, and partly as a seismic wave.

<doc id="246020" wikidata="Q451114" url="?curid=246020" title="Freydís Eiríksdóttir">
<text>Freydís Eiríksdóttir (born 965) was an Icelandic woman said to be the daughter of Erik the Red (as in her patronym), who figured prominently in the Norse exploration of North America as an early colonist of Vinland, while her brother, Leif Erikson, is credited in early histories of the region with the first European contact. The medieval and primary sources that mention Freydís are the two Vinland sagas: the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; and the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;. The two sagas offer differing accounts, though Freydís is portrayed in both as one of the strongest female vikings.

==&quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;==
The &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; is a crude version of the accounts that happened to the Norse in Vinland. Freydís&#x27; experiences in Vinland are relayed in Chapter 8 of this saga, which describes her as Leif Erikson&#x27;s full sister. This is the most famous account we have of Freydís.

After the success of expeditions to Vinland led by Leif Erikson, Þorvaldr Eiríksson, and Þorfinnr Karlsefni, Freydís wanted the prestige and wealth associated with a Vinland journey. She made a deal with two Icelandic men, Helgi and Finnbogi, that they should go together to Vinland and share all profits half-and-half. Freydís asked her brother Leif Erikson for permission to use the homes and stables that he had built in Vinland. He agreed that they all could use the houses. Helgi and Finnbogi agreed that they would bring the same number of men and supplies as Freydis, but Freydís smuggled more men into her ship. Helgi and Finnbogi, arriving early, took refuge in the houses; when Freydís arrived, she ordered the brothers to move, as the houses were her brother&#x27;s and meant for her. This was the first of many disagreements between Freydís and the brothers.

In Vinland, there was tension between the two groups. Helgi and Finnbogi set up a settlement separate from Freydis and her crew. Freydis eventually went to the brothers&#x27; hut and asked how they were faring. &quot;Well,&quot; responded the brothers; &quot;but we do not like this ill-feeling that has sprung up between us.&quot; The two sides made peace.

When she returned to her husband, Freydís claimed that Helgi and Finnbogi had beaten her, and, calling him a coward, demanded that he exact revenge on her behalf, or else she would divorce him. He gathered his men and killed Helgi and Finnbogi as well as the men in their camp when they were sleeping. When they refused to kill the five women in the camp, Freydís herself picked up an axe and massacred them.

Freydís, to conceal her treachery, threatened death to anyone who told of the killings. She went back to Greenland after a year&#x27;s stay and told her brother Leif Eiriksson that Helgi and Finnbogi had decided to stay in Vinland. However, word of the killings eventually reached Leif. He had three men from Freydís&#x27;s expedition tortured until they confessed the whole occurrence. Thinking ill of the deeds, Leif still did not want &quot;to do that to Freydís, my sister, which she has deserved.&quot; However, he remarked that he foresaw Freydís&#x27; descendants having little prosperity. The saga concludes that everyone thought ill of her descendants afterwards.

== &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; ==

The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; was written after &quot;The Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;. This saga portrays Freydís as a notable and strong woman, the half-sister to Leif Erikson. She joined an expedition to Vinland led by Þorfinnr Karlsefni, but is only mentioned once in the saga when the expedition was attacked by natives (also known as the &quot;Skrælingjar&quot; in Icelandic). The natives, equipped with &quot;war-slings, or catapults&quot;, stealthily attacked the expedition&#x27;s camp at night and shot at the warriors.

Many of the Norsemen panicked, having never seen such weaponry. As men fled during the confusion, Freydís, who was eight months pregnant, admonished them, saying: &quot;Why run you away from such worthless creatures, stout men that ye are, when, as seems to me likely, you might slaughter them like so many cattle? Let me but have a weapon, I know I could fight better than any of you.&quot;

Ignored, Freydís picked up the sword of the fallen Thorbrand Snorrisson and engaged the attacking natives. Surrounded by enemies, she undid her garment and beat the sword upon her breast. At this the natives retreated to their boats and fled. Þorfinnr and the other survivors praised her zeal.

== In popular culture ==
Freydís features as a main character in many modern novels including Ewald Gerhard Seeliger&#x27;s &quot;Freydis Rothaar&quot; (1919), Elizabeth Boyer&#x27;s &quot;Freydis and Gudrid&quot; (1976), William Vollmann&#x27;s &quot;The Ice-Shirt&quot; (1990), Joan Clark&#x27;s &quot;Eriksdottir: A Tale of Dreams and Luck&quot; (2002), Jackie French&#x27;s &quot;They Came on Viking Ships&quot; (2005), Amalia Carosella&#x27;s &quot;Daughter of a Thousand Years&quot; (2017), Laurent Binet&#x27;s &quot;Civilizations&quot; (2019), Max Davine&#x27;s &quot;Spirits of the Ice Forest&quot; (2021), Tamara Goranson&#x27;s &quot;The Voyage of Freydis&quot; (2021), and numerous others.

On television, Katia Winter portrayed Freydís in season 3 (2016–17) of the superhero TV series &quot;DC&#x27;s Legends of Tomorrow&quot; episodes &quot;Beebo the God of War&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Cuddly&quot;. Frida Gustavsson portrayed Freydís in the 2022 Netflix series &quot;&quot;.

A limited-mintage two-ounce silver coin was issued for the South Pacific island country of Niue and was announced in May 2021, depicting Freydis storming ashore from a longship.

<text>The Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet) is a transit agency that serves most of the Oregon part of the Portland metropolitan area. Created in 1969 by the Oregon legislature, the district replaced five private bus companies that operated in the three counties: Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas. TriMet began operating a light rail system, MAX, in 1986, which has since been expanded to five lines that now cover . It also operates the WES Commuter Rail line since 2009. It also provides the operators and maintenance personnel for the city of Portland-owned Portland Streetcar system. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

In addition to rail lines, TriMet provides the region&#x27;s bus system, as well as LIFT paratransit service. There are 688 buses in TriMet&#x27;s fleet that operate on 85 lines. In 2018, the entire system averaged 310,000 rides per weekday and operates buses and trains between the hours of approximately 5 a.m. and 2 a.m. TriMet&#x27;s annual budget for FY 2018 is $525.8 million, with 30% of resources coming from a district-wide payroll tax and 10% from fares. The district is overseen by a seven-person board of directors appointed by the state&#x27;s governor. , the agency has around 3,428 employees.

== General information ==
TriMet is &quot;a municipal corporation of the State of Oregon&quot;, with powers to tax, issue bonds, and enact police ordinances and is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the Governor of Oregon. It has its own boundary, which currently encompasses an area of about . The TriMet district serves portions of the counties of Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas; it extends from Troutdale to Forest Grove east to west, and from Sauvie Island to Oregon City and Estacada north to south.

For more than 30 years the agency called itself Tri-Met, but it formally dropped the hyphen from its name in 2002, as part of a new corporate identity strategy involving a redesigned logo and new color scheme for its vehicles and other media.

TriMet was formed in 1969 after disputes between the Portland City Council and the Rose City Transit Company, the private company that previously operated the bus system serving the city (but not its suburbs). The new public agency was created by an ordinance of the Portland city council, under provisions of a law enacted by the 1969 Oregon Legislature, and took over all of Rose City Transit&#x27;s service and fleet effective December 1, 1969. Bus service in the suburban portions of the metropolitan area was operated by four smaller private companies which had a common union and were collectively known as the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; lines: Portland Stages, Tualatin Valley Buses, Intercity Buses and Estacada-Molalla Stages. These were taken over by TriMet on September 6, 1970. Eighty-eight buses owned by the four suburban companies were transferred to TriMet, but many were found to be in poor condition and the TriMet board soon took action to replace them with new buses.
As of January 2024, TriMet operates a total of 695 buses on 84 routes, 145 MAX light rail cars on five lines, and 253 LIFT paratransit vehicles. Each of the five MAX and 17 of the bus lines are designated as &quot;Frequent Service&quot; lines, scheduled to operate at headways of 15 minutes or less for most of the service day (service is less frequent in the early morning and late evening).

TriMet connects to several other public transit systems:
* Portland Streetcar, a circulator streetcar service in downtown Portland and nearby neighborhoods
* C-Tran, serving Vancouver and Clark County, Washington
* Canby Area Transit, serving Canby and rural areas south of Oregon City along Highway 99E (formerly within the TriMet district)
* Cherriots, the public transit service for Salem and Keizer, connecting at the Wilsonville WES station
* Columbia County Rider, serving Scappoose, St. Helens, and Columbia County
* Sandy Area Metro, serving Sandy (formerly within the TriMet district)
* SMART, serving Wilsonville (formerly within the TriMet district)
* South Clackamas Transportation District, serving Molalla and rural areas south of Oregon City along Highway 213 (formerly within the TriMet district)
* Tillamook County Transportation District, serving Tillamook County
* Yamhill County Transit Area, serving Yamhill County

TriMet also links to various local shuttle services operated by the following: Ride Connection, which serves Banks, Gaston, King City and North Plains; the Swan Island Transportation Management Association; the Tualatin Transportation Management Association; Intel; Nike; and Oregon Health &amp; Science University, including the Portland Aerial Tram.

Long-range transportation planning for the metropolitan area is provided by Metro, an elected regional government. Metro also has statutory authority to take over the day-to-day operations of TriMet, but has never exercised that power, as past studies of such a merger have found it to be problematic.

== Rail lines ==
TriMet runs the MAX Light Rail (short for Metropolitan Area Express) system, and contracts with Portland and Western Railroad to operate the WES Commuter Rail line (short for Westside Express Service). Fares on MAX (as well as WES) are the same as TriMet bus fares, and fare collection uses a proof-of-payment system (or honor system) with ticket vending machines at each station. Fare inspectors patrol the system randomly. Incidents of violence on the system have led to calls for more security, and some have argued that more thorough checking of fares would improve riders&#x27; overall feeling of safety.

The TransitTracker system uses satellite tracking on buses and sensors in the MAX tracks to predict arrival times at stops and stations. Additionally, TriMet is partnering with Google Maps to install Bluetooth low energy beacons on MAX platforms, allowing nearby Android device users to directly receive schedule and alert information.

TriMet trains operate using reporting mark TMTC.

TriMet&#x27;s rail lines include:

;Light rail
* Blue Line: Hillsboro – Beaverton – City Center – Gresham
* Green Line: Portland State University – City Center – Clackamas
* Orange Line: Union Station – City Center – Milwaukie
* Red Line: Hillsboro – Beaverton – City Center – Portland International Airport
* Yellow Line: Expo Center – City Center – Portland State University
;Commuter rail
*WES: Beaverton – Tigard – Tualatin – Wilsonville

From 1991 until 2014, TriMet also operated the Portland Vintage Trolley service, which ran on a portion of the MAX system on most weekends. It was reduced to only seven dates per year in 2011 and was discontinued entirely in July 2014.

Additionally, the Portland Streetcar system, which is owned and managed by the City of Portland, not TriMet, is operated and maintained by TriMet under contract with the City of Portland. TriMet also provides a portion of the funding for the streetcar lines.

== Bus service ==

, TriMet operates 75 bus routes (plus five routes that replace the MAX light rail service in late-night hours). Each route is identified by both a number and a name. The numbers are mostly in the range 1–99, but there are currently eight routes with three-digit numbers. From 1969 until 1973, TriMet bus routes were named but not numbered, a practice inherited from Rose City Transit and the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; lines, but route numbers were assigned to all routes in August 1973.

Seventeen bus routes are designated as &quot;Frequent Service Lines&quot;, which the agency defines as having a headway of 15 minutes or less most of the service day (service is less frequent in the early morning and late evening). Fifty-eight percent of all bus trips are on the frequent service lines. Bus stops that are served by a frequent service line are identified with an additional green sign.

The bus system includes 15 transit centers, that allow passengers to transfer between bus routes and, at many transit centers, MAX routes.

TriMet buses began carrying bicycles on the front in 1992, on a trial basis on eight routes; the experiment was judged a success and within three years the entire bus fleet had been fitted with bike racks.

TriMet added a temporary free shuttle service connecting between Rose Quarter Transit Center and a temporary bottle redemption facility in industrial district in Northwest Portland specifically to address people redeeming empty containers while grocers have been relieved from the Oregon Bottle Bill during the COVID-19 pandemic. This service was created at the request of Governor Kate Brown and it went into service on April 29, 2020.

On September 18, 2022, TriMet started its FX (Frequent Express) service, a limited-stop bus route with some bus rapid transit features. FX replaced the 2-Division, the sixth busiest bus route in the system, and features articulated buses, all-door boarding, transit signal priority, bus lanes and frequent service (12-minute headways all day).

== Fares ==

TriMet uses a flat fare system, with a single price (for each category of rider: adult, youth, senior or disabled) regardless of the distance of the trip. Single-fare tickets permit unlimited transfers to other routes within 2½ hours, and passes are valid until end of the service day.

Several different methods of fare payment are available. On buses, riders can pay with cash, but no change is given. On the MAX Light Rail system, in common with most other North American light rail systems and on the WES Commuter Rail line, TriMet uses a proof-of-payment fare system, requiring riders not already in possession of a valid fare to purchase or validate one before boarding. Ticket vending machines at MAX and WES stations accept cash and credit and debit cards. For both bus and rail riders, a number of other payment methods are available as an alternative to cash.

TriMet tickets and passes are also valid on the Portland Streetcar, which is owned by the City of Portland but operated mostly by TriMet personnel under a contract with the city.

TriMet also has a mobile ticketing app, allowing riders to purchase and use tickets for buses, light rail, and commuter rail on their smartphones. The app, called TriMet Tickets, was developed by Portland startup GlobeSherpa (now Moovel Transit) and released in September 2013 at no cost to TriMet. Instead, Moovel Transit will take a commission on every ticket sale through the app.

An e-fare system named &quot;Hop Fastpass&quot; was introduced in July 2017. Developed by INIT (Innovations in Transportation) for TriMet, the City of Portland, and C-Tran, at a cost estimated (in 2015) to be about $30 million, the new Hop Fastpass system enables riders to pay with a fare card, using card readers on buses and train platforms and, as of August 2017, using a smartphone equipped with NFC (near field communication) via a digital wallet. The name is said to evoke both the speed of the rabbit and the hop plant used as an ingredient in the craft beer brewed in Portland.

== Fleet ==

=== Buses ===

, TriMet&#x27;s fleet included 696 buses, in lengths of either 40 or 30 feet (12 or 9 meters) for use on traditional fixed-route services. TriMet also owns a fleet of 253 minibuses and 15 vans for use on LIFT Paratransit service.

By March 2017, the entire active fleet of regular buses were low-floor models and equipped with air-conditioning. This was the culmination of a plan launched 20 years earlier. In 1997, the TriMet board decided that all buses purchased in the future should be low-floor type and equipped with air-conditioning. The decision was for a gradual phase-out of high-floor, non-air-conditioned buses as they reached the ends of their normal lifespan (about 18–20 years) and in 2013 TriMet was anticipating that by 2017 all buses would have low floors without steps. TriMet retired its last non-air-conditioned buses in late December 2015. The last series of high-floor buses in service were taken out of regular use in June 2016, but with some kept serviceable through the summer for use on temporary shuttles used during construction-related disruptions to MAX service that took place between August and September.

While most of TriMet&#x27;s fleet uses diesel motors for propulsion, the agency has also experimented with hybrid electric buses. The first two hybrid buses entered service in 2002, but in 2008 TriMet stated that the buses had not performed sufficiently better than its newest diesel buses to justify the estimated 50-percent-higher purchase cost, and that consequently the agency had no plans to purchase additional hybrid buses at that time. These first two hybrid buses were retired in 2012. However, with hybrid technology having improved since that earlier purchase, TriMet acquired four new hybrid buses in 2012 and placed them into service in January 2013 on line 72, a long, mostly level north–south route. TriMet acquired four more hybrid buses in 2015 with even greater electronic technology on board.

Since October 30, 2006, all TriMet buses and paratransit minibuses have been fueled by a B5 biodiesel blend. Plans to increase to a B10 or higher mix were later put on hold as a result of cost increases and problems experienced in a trial use of B10 blend in about one-quarter of the fleet.

The agency delayed new bus purchases for four years due to the recession of 2008 and the resulting decrease in income from taxes. In 2012 TriMet began to replace buses on an accelerated schedule. By that time some of the buses in the fleet were more than 20 years old and had become more expensive to maintain and less reliable. The first order of 55 40-foot Gillig buses began to enter service in fall 2012, followed by 70 buses in 2013, 60 in the summer of 2014, followed by another 30 in October 2014. In early 2015, TriMet received its first new 30-foot buses in more than 20 years. These 22 Gillig buses are similar to the rest of TriMet&#x27;s new buses, but their shorter length allows them to serve routes with tighter turns and difficult terrain.

By mid-2016 TriMet planned to have 326 buses on the road under four years old, which would allow the agency to meet the industry standard of an average age of eight years. TriMet&#x27;s 3900-series buses, an order of 64 diesel buses built in 2018 and 2019 and entering service in February 2019, introduced a new paint scheme for the agency, of all-over blue with a trio of semi-upright orange stripes near the rear on each side.

The Frequent Express service operates a fleet of articulated buses; they were manufactured by Nova Bus in Plattsburgh, New York. Each bus can carry up to 115 passengers, 60% more than TriMet&#x27;s standard bus, and features all-door, right-side boarding via three doors along the front, middle, and rear. Up to two bicycles can be stored inside the bus using roll-in racks located near the rear.

TriMet&#x27;s buses operate out of three garages:
* Center Street Garage (in inner Southeast Portland); current facilities opened in 1978, replacing former RCT facilities at same site
* Merlo Garage (in Beaverton to the west); opened in 1980 with temporary facilities, and full-service maintenance building opened in 1983
* Powell Garage (located in East Portland); opened in 1977; completely rebuilt 2018–2022 (with main building and most other structures replaced)

=== Light rail (MAX) ===
TriMet&#x27;s fleet includes 145 light rail vehicles, of 5 general types: TriMet Type 1, Type 2/Type 3 (almost identical), Type 4 and Type 5. The first two cars of Type 5 entered service in April 2015. TriMet placed an order for new cars to replace the Type 1 trains in 2019. The first car arrived in December 2022, to be tested.

==== Notes ====

Notes on capacities:

* The capacities given are for a single car; a two-car train has double the capacity.
* The Type 2 cars originally had 72 seats, but eight seats were later removed, to make space for bicycles.
* All of these capacity figures are based on &quot;normal&quot; loading conditions (defined as 4 standing passengers per square meter by industry standards); under so-called &quot;crush&quot; loading conditions (6-8 standees per m2), all of these cars are capable of carrying many more passengers than stated here.

=== Commuter rail (WES) ===
The commuter rail line between Beaverton and Wilsonville is operated primarily with trains made up from a fleet of four Colorado Railcar Aero diesel multiple unit railcars. TriMet also owns four Budd RDC diesel multiple-unit railcars, of which two have entered service and are used as a backup.

== Paint schemes ==

TriMet has had four main paint schemes during its five-decade history. The agency&#x27;s first paint scheme, adopted in April 1970, featured a tangerine (or orange) base with silver (unpainted metal) along the middle portion of the lower half and a white stripe below and above the windows. The windshield also had a white outline around it. The white above the windows curved upward to the roof at the first door, leaving the bus&#x27;s front section all orange at the roof.

TriMet&#x27;s second paint scheme, which was adopted in August 1980 and was the agency&#x27;s standard paint scheme from 1980 to 2002 (but remains in use on most of the Type 2 MAX cars in 2021), features a white base with a three-color stripe below the windows. The stripe colors are (in order from top to bottom) burgundy, red and orange, and near the front on each side the stripe makes a sharp bend and angles upward to the roof (except on MAX cars). The logo of TriMetwhich at that time was still using the hyphenated spelling &quot;Tri-Met&quot;was shown on the front end.

TriMet&#x27;s third paint scheme, of white with blue and &quot;buttery&quot; yellow, was adopted in August 2002. It features a white base with a large blue semi-circle at the top, curving downward, and a smaller pale yellow semi-circle at the bottom, curving upward. This was the first paint scheme to use the current logo.

TriMet&#x27;s current standard paint scheme was introduced in early 2019. It is all-over blue with three orange vertical, and slightly angled, lines in the rear portion on each side, with the middle line being thicker than the two outer lines. TriMet&#x27;s Frequent Express (FX) buses have a similar paint scheme, but with green and blue colors.

There have also been other paint scheme variations. TriMet&#x27;s 3800-series battery-electric buses use an all-blue paint scheme with several blue stripes and wind turbine graphics to call attention to their being all-electric buses. The WES RDCs use a paint scheme of mostly bare metal with a large white stripe along the windows, and a smaller blue stripe above the white stripe. The front of the train has a blue and yellow stripe pattern.

== Timeline ==
=== 1960s ===
*1969 Tri-Met takes over for the nearly bankrupt Rose City Transit Company. The system has 175 buses and a daily ridership of about 65,000.

=== 1970s ===
*1970 Tri-Met takes over the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; companies, the four companies which had been providing bus service to and within Portland&#x27;s suburbs, adding another 88 buses to the agency&#x27;s fleet.
*1973 Route numbers (or Line numbers) are adopted for the first time; previously, routes had been designated only by names.
*1974 The first shelters at bus stops are installed.
*1975 The &quot;Fareless Square&quot; is created in downtown Portland, with the goal of reducing short automobile trips within the city core and attracting more riders. Fares outside the Square are 35 cents. The zone-based fare system was discontinued at that time, but was reinstated less than four years later and remained in use until 2012.
*1977/78 The 22-block Portland Transit Mall opens on downtown&#x27;s Fifth and Sixth Avenues. The mall includes bus-only lanes and provides a hub to make it easier for riders to make connections. Tri-Met also introduces the seven &quot;sector symbols&quot;, for different areas of the transit district, used at stops on the new mall: Brown Beaver (SE), Green Leaf (S), Yellow Rose (SW), Orange Deer (W), Red Fish (N), Purple Raindrops (NE) and Blue Snowflake (E)
*1978 After 3½ years using a &quot;flat&quot; fare system, a zonal fare structure is reinstated, with three fare zones. Zone 1 consisted of downtown Portland and extending about one to two miles (3 km) out. Zone 2 was a ring around Zone 1 out two to three more miles. Zone 3 wrapped around Zone 2 and consisted of the rest of the system within the suburbs of Portland.

=== 1980s ===
*1981 24-hour recorded schedule information becomes available over the phone.

*1982 Tri-Met introduces articulated buses for the first time. The buses were manufactured by Crown-Ikarus, a now-defunct partnership between Ikarus, of Hungary, and Crown Coach, of California, but they proved to be sufficiently trouble-plagued that the agency later sues the manufacturer to recover expenses tied to excessive repairs; a settlement was reached in 1987. The last bus was retired in 1999 and TriMet did not purchase articulated buses again until 2019 (for the Division Transit Project, to enter service in 2022).
*1982 In September, Tri-Met introduces a proof-of-payment (or &quot;self-service&quot;) fare system for all service, but discontinues it in June 1984, due to fare evasion, high equipment repair costs and other problems.
*1983 Completion of the installation of two-way radios on the entire fleet; 100 buses already had radios by 1980, and all others were equipped in 1982–83.
*1986 As part of a package of budget cuts, Tri-Met discontinues its all-night &quot;Owl&quot; service, making Portland the second largest U.S. city without all-night transit service. Seven regular (daytime) bus routes also were eliminated.
*1986 The 15-mile (24 km) long MAX Light Rail line between Portland and Gresham opens. It reintroduces rail transit service to the Portland area, missing since the 1950s.
*1989 Tri-Met is named the best large transit system in North America by the American Public Transit Association.
=== 1990s ===
*1992 The first bike racks are installed on the fronts of some Tri-Met buses, as part of a one-year trial project.
*1995 Tri-Met&#x27;s website goes online, hosted by local ISP Teleport (which eventually becomes acquired by OneMain.com, later to become part of Earthlink). At the time when Internet access was less ubiquitous, Tri-Met also offered a dial-up information service through Teleport using a Unix shell and Lynx.
*1996 Tri-Met begins to equip its bus fleet with vehicle tracking system equipment, to enable monitoring of buses in service, using GPS technology.
*1997 The first low-floor buses and light-rail cars go into service.
*1998 Westside MAX (now known as the Blue Line between Portland and Hillsboro) opens. Tri-Met also establishes bus lines that come every 15 minutes or sooner everyday, lessening the need to consult a schedule when using them.
*1999 Satellite-assisted bus arrival time displays (later to be named &quot;Transit Tracker&quot;) are installed at select major bus stops in North Portland and downtown.

=== 2000s ===
*2001 Fareless Square is expanded to a small portion of Northeast Portland between Lloyd Center and the Steel Bridge. Airport MAX (the Red Line) begins service on September 10 after a public/private partnership, prompted by a proposal from Bechtel Corporation, enables its construction years ahead of TriMet&#x27;s plans for the use of public funds. Bechtel received exclusive development rights to 120 acres (486,000 m2) near the entrance to Portland International Airport. The original MAX line began to be referred to as the MAX Blue Line upon the opening of the Red Line. Bus sector symbols began to be phased out from maps and publications.
*2002 With the September schedule change, Tri-Met launches a new corporate identity strategy. It is renamed TriMet (without a hyphen) and a new logo and blue, white and yellow livery are introduced. An improved automated phone service is introduced.
*2004 Interstate MAX (the Yellow Line) opens along Interstate Avenue. The fleet has grown to 638 buses, 208 paratransit vehicles, and 105 trains with a daily ridership of over 300,000.
*2005 TriMet introduces biodiesel fuel into its fleet, using a B5 blend (5 percent pure biodiesel, 95 percent petroleum diesel), initially on LIFT (paratransit) minibuses only. Use of B5 biodiesel was expanded to the entire bus fleet in late 2006.
*2007 The Portland Mall, on 5th and 6th Avenues, is shut down for rebuilding and southward extension (to PSU), including adding a second light-rail alignment through downtown. The rebuilding, to take over 2 years, is part of the MAX Green Line project, but will also replace all infrastructure for buses on the already 29-year-old transit mall. Most bus routes serving downtown are detoured to other streets until 2009.
*2009 The WES Commuter Rail opens on February 2. WES (Westside Express Service) provides service between Beaverton and Wilsonville with stations in Tigard and Tualatin in between.
*2009 In May, the Portland Mall reopens for buses, and testing and training runs for the new Mall MAX tracks begin, for opening August 30.
*2009 Due to the national recession&#x27;s effect on the agency&#x27;s finances, the board approves a series of service reductions, to take effect in September. The board votes on August 12 to discontinue Fareless Square for bus service beginning in January 2010, while retaining fare-free rides in the downtown area on MAX and the Portland Streetcar.
*2009 On August 30, MAX service on the transit mall is introduced, with the shifting of the Yellow Line to the new alignment. September 12 brings the opening of the Green Line, also using the new transit-mall tracks, running from downtown (PSU) to Clackamas Town Center. It is TriMet&#x27;s first light rail line serving Clackamas County.
=== 2010s ===
* 2012 TriMet purchases 55 new Gillig diesel buses to begin replacing buses dating back to 1990. The last four of the new buses are hybrid-electrics estimated to be 20-50% more fuel-efficient and produce 95% fewer emissions; they replaced hybrid buses that were in service since 2002.
* 2012 TriMet discontinues &quot;Free Rail Zone&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Fareless Square&quot;) in Downtown Portland and ends use of three-zone, distance-based fare system. Until this time, the TriMet district was divided into three fare zones, with fares based on the number of zones in which a passenger traveled.
* 2015 TriMet opens the new MAX Orange Line from Downtown Portland to Milwaukie, and the Tilikum Crossing, used by the Orange Line and two bus lines
* 2018 After 32 years without any all-night transit service, TriMet extends service hours on lines 20-Burnside/Stark and 57-TV Highway to run 24 hours a day. The agency also establishes Line 272-PDX Night Bus to provide early-morning service between NE 82nd Avenue and the Portland International Airport.
* 2019 TriMet introduces a new paint scheme, the first such change since 2002.
* 2019 TriMet&#x27;s first battery-electric buses, numbered 3801–3805, go into service.

=== 2020s ===

* 2022 on September 18, TriMet&#x27;s 14-mile Frequent Express line opens. 31 60-foot Novabus LFSA buses are put into service for use on the line.
* 2024 on August 25, TriMet completed the A Better Red project.

== Future ==

TriMet works with local jurisdictions and agencies to identify and recommend priority transit projects to include in Metro&#x27;s Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The 2018 RTP is Metro&#x27;s latest iteration, and it lists three funding scenarios that divide the region&#x27;s proposals into three priority levels. The highest priority projects, which are referred to as &quot;2027 Constrained&quot;, are proposals the region expects to have funding for by 2027. The &quot;2040 Constrained&quot; lists projects that fit within the region&#x27;s planned budget through 2040, while the &quot;2040 Strategic&quot; are projects that may be built if additional funding becomes available. TriMet also has a page on their website discussing the future plans for their rail and bus lines.

=== Current projects ===
=== Other proposals ===
TriMet has indicated that other extensions and improvements have been studied or discussed with Metro and cities in the region. These proposals include the following, with light rail and alternatives being considered:

* Extension to Forest Grove via Cornelius and Tualatin Valley Highway (OR 8)
* Extension to Oregon City via McLoughlin Boulevard (OR 99E)
* Extension to Bridgeport Village via I-205
* Extension to Hillsboro via Sunset Highway (US 26)
* Extension to Vancouver, Washington

== Communities served ==
The following cities and unincorporated communities (*) are in the TriMet service area:

*Aloha*
*Beaverton
*Bethany*
*Cedar Hills*
*Cedar Mill*
*Clackamas*
*Cornelius
*Durham
*Estacada
*Forest Grove
*Fairview
*Gladstone
*Gresham
*Hillsboro
*Happy Valley
*Johnson City
*King City
*Lake Oswego
*Milwaukie
*Maywood Park
*Oak Grove*
*Oregon City
*Portland
*Rivergrove
*Sherwood
*Tigard
*Troutdale
*Tualatin
*West Linn
*Wood Village
TriMet buses and commuter rail also serve Wilsonville, Oregon, which is outside the TriMet district, in order to provide connections to transit services operated by SMART in that city.

A state law that went into effect on October 1, 1987, enabled communities with a population of less than 10,000 to petition to leave the TriMet district. A petition, which needed to be signed by at least 15 percent of registered voters in the affected area, must demonstrate that a community is not receiving adequate service and that TriMet&#x27;s payroll tax is adversely affecting business activity for the withdrawal from the transit district to be approved. The first three areas to make use of the law and withdraw from the TriMet district, effective January 1, 1989, were Damascus, Molalla, and Wilsonville. The Boring area was removed from the TriMet District on January 1, 2013.

== Safety ==

TriMet employs a transit police division to patrol its services. Officers in this division normally serve with local law enforcement agencies and are assigned terms with the transit police; this partnership with local police enables the closest available unit to respond to incidents. TriMet also partners with the Transportation Security Administration, which provides a canine unit to detect explosives and deter acts of terrorism. Riders are encouraged to alert TriMet employees using on-board intercoms or to dial 9-1-1 when witnessing crime or suspicious activity. TriMet operates over 4,000 security cameras. All TriMet vehicles became fully equipped with cameras in 2014.

In the aftermath of the 2020 George Floyd protests, TriMet reallocated $1.8 million in police contracts and established a transit public safety committee to reevaluate safety and security. In June 2020, an audit by Portland&#x27;s Independent Police Review concluded that accountability for the transit police, which the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) oversaw, &quot;fell short of the community&#x27;s expectations&quot;. According to the audit, PPB&#x27;s management &quot;led to some adverse outcomes with community members when they have a negative encounter with a transit officer and learn that accountability is elusive.&quot; The following March, TriMet reassigned control of the transit police to the Multnomah County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. In fall 2021, TriMet deployed a Safety Response Team on MAX. The 24-member team is unarmed and aims to &quot;connect riders in need with social services, reduce 911 calls for non-emergencies, and provide emergency supplies to those who need them.&quot;

== Criticism and controversies ==

=== Operator fatigue ===
An investigation by &quot;The Oregonian&quot; in 2013 led to the revelation that some TriMet drivers were working as many as 22 hours in a 24-hour period. There have also been 22 reported cases of drivers falling asleep at the wheel. In response, the agency adopted a new policy restricting the number of hours a driver is permitted to work within a 24-hour period.

=== Failure rate of MAX ticket vending machines ===

An investigation by several local Portland news outlets found that several of the MAX Light Rail ticket machines have extremely high failure rates. Many riders have claimed that they have received a fare evasion citation after boarding the MAX train without a fare after they have attempted to pay for a ticket. The official statement from TriMet is to ride to the next MAX station, de-board the train, pay for a ticket there, and wait for the next train. That response has been deemed unacceptable both by riders and bus/rail operators. TriMet has begun replacing all of its older machines with newer machines and cites a 50% drop in complaints.

<doc id="246027" wikidata="Q677253" url="?curid=246027" title="Sigmoid colon">
<text>The sigmoid colon (or pelvic colon) is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. It forms a loop that averages about in length. The loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma (ς) or Latin letter S (thus &quot;sigma&quot; + &quot;&quot;). This part of the colon normally lies within the pelvis, but due to its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity.

==Structure==
The sigmoid colon begins at the superior aperture of the lesser pelvis, where it is continuous with the iliac colon, and passes transversely across the front of the sacrum to the right side of the pelvis.

It then curves on itself and turns toward the left to reach the middle line at the level of the third piece of the sacrum, where it bends downward and ends in the rectum.

Its function is to expel solid and gaseous waste from the gastrointestinal tract. The curving path it takes toward the anus allows it to store gas in the superior arched portion, enabling the colon to expel gas without excreting faeces simultaneously.

===Coverings===
The sigmoid colon is completely surrounded by peritoneum (and thus is not retroperitoneal), which forms a mesentery (sigmoid mesocolon), which diminishes in length from the center toward the ends of the loop, where it disappears, so that the loop is fixed at its junctions with the iliac colon and rectum, but enjoys a considerable range of movement in its central portion.

===Nerve supply===
Pelvic splanchnic nerves are the primary source for parasympathetic innervation. Lumbar splanchnic nerves provide sympathetic innervation via the inferior mesenteric ganglion.

===Relations===
Behind the sigmoid colon are the external iliac vessels, ovary, obturator nerve, the left piriformis, and left sacral plexus of nerves.

In front, it is separated from the bladder in the male, and the uterus in the female, by some coils of the small intestine.

==Clinical significance==

Diverticulosis often occurs in the sigmoid colon in association with increased intraluminal pressure and focal weakness in the colonic wall. It is a common cause of hematochezia.

Volvulus occurs when a portion of the bowel twists around its mesentery, which can lead to obstruction and infarction. Volvulus in the elderly commonly occurs in the sigmoid colon, whereas in infants and children it is more likely to occur in the midgut. This may correct itself spontaneously or the rotation may continue until the blood supply of the gut is cut off completely.

<doc id="246028" wikidata="Q598508" url="?curid=246028" title="Kaizers Orchestra">
<text>Kaizers Orchestra is a Norwegian alternative rock band formed in Bergen on 1 January 2000. They are notable for being among the first non-black-metal Norwegian artists singing in their native language to become popular beyond Scandinavia.

In 2012, the group announced that following a 2013 &quot;Farewell Tour&quot;, they would take a long break. Their final concert was held on 14 September 2013 at DNB Arena in Stavanger, and was also streamed live online. In November 2022, following weeks of teasers and speculation, the band confirmed a reunion and comeback tour scheduled for 2023.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1995–2004)===
In 1998, childhood friends Janove Ottesen and Geir Zahl released their only album by their band gnom called &quot;Mys&quot;. Of its 1000 copies, only 500 or so were sold the first year. However, they were known well in the area around Stavanger in Norway, having played as the local band Blod, snått &amp; juling, and one of the songs they wrote after &quot;Mys&quot; called &quot;Bastard&quot; got good crowd response. A line from &quot;Bastard&quot; (&quot;A certain Mr. Kaizer took me in/He is the proud owner of the world&#x27;s heaviest siamese cat&quot;) and the song&#x27;s overall crowd response became a source of inspiration for Ottesen, and after gnom dissolved after disappointing record sales, he formed Kaizers Orchestra.

In 2000, Kaizers Orchestra recorded the Kaizers Orchestra EP, containing four songs: &quot;Bastard&quot;, &quot;Bøn fra helvete&quot;, &quot;Katastrofen&quot; and &quot;Dekk bord&quot;. During , a Norwegian festival focusing on up-and-coming artists, the band&#x27;s songs were played frequently on the radio. Kaizers Orchestra&#x27;s sound and creative use of instruments was noticed by the small, Scandinavian label Broilerfarm. Their first album, &quot;Ompa til du dør&quot;, was released on this label in September 2001. It was critically acclaimed and became a success, first in Norway, later in Denmark and the Netherlands. The album won a Spellemannpris (Norwegian Grammy) for &quot;Best Rock&quot;, as well as two Alarm-awards (underground version of Spellemannprisen). &quot;Ompa til du dør&quot; also made Kaizers Orchestra the highest-selling rock debut to be released in the Norwegian language. The second album, &quot;Evig pint&quot;, was released in February 2003.

===&quot;Maestro&quot;, &quot;Vega&quot;, and a book (2005–2007)===
The third album, &quot;Maestro&quot;, was released on 15 August 2005 in Norway and Europe. In connection with the release of &quot;Maestro&quot;, Kaizers Orchestra signed an international record deal with Universal Germany, taking them from one of the smallest labels to one of the biggest.

Their 5 and 6 October 2005 performances at Vega, in Copenhagen, Denmark, were recorded for a live DVD, titled &quot;Viva La Vega&quot;, and double CD, &quot;Live at Vega&quot;. A book by Geir Zahl&#x27;s older brother Jan, called &quot;Kontroll på kontinentet&quot; was released 18 October 2006. It is close to 300 pages and include almost 150 pictures documenting the 2005 Maestro tour. In 2007, the members of Kaizers Orchestra took a break from playing live. All members (bar Helge) are involved in some sort of side project, and they concentrated on these in their break time. They only played three shows in 2007: one in Hungary, at the Sziget Festival, one in Norway, at Cementen, and finally at the German art expo Documenta.

===&quot;Maskineri&quot;, &quot;250 Prosent&quot;, and &quot;Våre Demoner&quot; (2007–2011)===

On September 6, 2006, the band released information about their upcoming fourth album. The album was recorded in Berlin, Germany, assisted by producer-engineer Mark Howard (producer). The audio mixing for the album was done in Los Angeles, California. The album title was revealed to be &quot;Maskineri&quot; in December 2007, and around the same time, the first single, &quot;Enden av november&quot;, was released. The album was released on February 19, 2008, on Sony BMG. They claimed to have chosen the smaller label instead of working with Universal for more freedom.

On 12 December 2007, Kaizers Orchestra received &quot;Bragdprisen&quot; (Achievement Award) from the county of Rogaland, due to their efforts to promote their native Bryne dialect. Helge Risa was the only one available to show up at the award ceremony, as the rest of the band were busy doing the album mixing.

In February 2008, the band released their fourth album, and toured to support it, recording the audio of all the concerts. Not long after that, in fall 2008, they released a live album called &quot;250 prosent&quot;. The live album consisted of what they thought were the best songs recorded while they were in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The album was released primarily on vinyl, but it was made also available as a digital download through the iTunes Store. They supported the release of that album by a &quot;rarities&quot; tour, playing songs they rarely played live.

After that it was believed they were taking a break, for the members to work on their other projects and work on writing songs for the next album, but on 14 February 2009, they revealed that in January they had recorded several songs for a compilation album scheduled for release on April 20, which was then pushed back to April 27 for marketing reasons. The album, &quot;Våre demoner&quot;, consists of surplus material from each of their previous studio albums. On 18 December 2009, &quot;Ompa til du dør&quot; was voted as the best Norwegian song of the decade in a public poll on the website of NRK P3, one of the biggest radio stations in Norway. &quot;Kontroll på kontinentet&quot; and &quot;Maestro&quot; got third and fourth place in the same list. The band performed all three songs live on the radio after being announced as the winners.

At a press conference in August 2009, the band announced that they were working on a stage musical together with Tore Renberg (who wrote the stage play). It is named &quot;Sonny&quot; (&quot;Maestro&quot; abroad), and is based on the text universe and characters from the band&#x27;s first three albums. Several of the songs Kaizers Orchestra recorded in 2010 were used in the piece. The musical premiered at the Rogaland Theatre November 11, 2011.

===&quot;Violeta Violeta&quot; and hiatus (2009–2013)===

In January 2010, the band performed new material as part of Eurosonic in the Netherlands. In February, they announced the title of their next album, which will be a trilogy of albums. The album&#x27;s title is &quot;Violeta Violeta&quot; and its recording sessions will be financed by the income produced by their tour in February 2010. People attending the tour are to be given special edition versions of the album. They released their first single from the trilogy, &quot;Philemon Arthur &amp; the Dung&quot;, in August, 2010. They released the sheet music for their second single, &quot;Hjerteknuser&quot;, in October; in the same month, the single and its accompanying music video were released. The first volume of the trilogy was released on January 31, 2011. Stian Kristiansen has been said to be directing a music video for a song from the album; however, currently the only video, &quot;Hjerteknuser&quot;, has been directed by Thomas Berg. Their tenth-anniversary concert, which coincides with the final performance of the supporting tour, was held at Oslo Spektrum on 9 April 2011. The performance was recorded and was released as the live DVD/CD &quot;Live i Oslo Spektrum&quot; on 11 November 2011.

In 2012, the band was awarded &quot;Årets Spellemann&quot; (Artist of the Year) in a ceremony in their &quot;hometown&quot; of Stavanger. During their acceptance speech they announced that following their 2013 tour, they would retire after thirteen years together. In 2013 they also contributed to the book &quot;Think like a rockstar&quot; (&quot;Tenk som en rockestjerne&quot;), written by Ståle Økland. Their 2013 &quot;Siste Dans Tour&quot; (Last Dance Tour) ended in Stavanger on 14 September 2013. The concert, which was their last, was streamed online to fans and published on DVD and Blu-ray exactly one year later.

===&quot;Dine Gamle Dager Er Nå&quot; (2022-present)===
On October 26, 2022, the band announced that they had discovered boxes of old merchandise, namely T-shirts, and would be donating them to the charitable clothing store Fretex to sell (incidentally the same store where they had bought their stage outfits in 2001). In the following days, fans who had bought the shirts noticed QR codes printed inside, which led to the website dinegamledagererna.no. Those who accessed the website through a QR code received a one-time message telling them they were &quot;one of the 107&quot;, while for other visitors the site displayed a music box playing an unknown melody, and allowed people to enter their contact information for further updates. Some fans that registered on the site later received a physical version of that music box delivered to them, along with a QR code. A complementary Instagram account was also discovered, posting teaser images and stories. After two weeks of cryptic teasers, the website and Instagram published a promo video with the music box theme and full orchestration, ending with cut-out letters showing &quot;7.11.1907, 19:07&quot;.

These events led to mass speculation that a reunion was imminent, with fans also noting several coincidences: the company behind the website and Instagram (Sesong 1) had previously been responsible for the Kaizervirus marketing for Violeta Violeta vol. III, both Geir Zahl and Janove Ottesen had just finished major solo releases, Terje Winterstø Røthings&#x27; band Skambankt had recently completed their farewell tour, and some fans even discovered that the kindergarten where Helge Risa taught had a job listing for his position.

Following weeks of speculation and teasers, the video &quot;Dine gamle dager er nå&quot; premiered on the official Kaizers Orchestra YouTube channel on Monday, November 7, at 19:07, the exact time teased previously. Two days later, the band officially confirmed that they had reunited and would be commencing a 24-date Norwegian tour in the fall of 2023, with tickets being made available soon after. After selling out within two hours, sixteen further concerts were added to the schedule later the same day.

In the press release confirming their reunion, the band stated that the comeback had been in the works planned for years, after drummer Rune Solheim had posed the question in 2019, at one of the members&#x27; annual Christmas dinners, and that the concert venues had been booked two years in advance.

In June 2023 Kaizers Orchestra began promoting the release of their new single on social media. Their first single in ten years, &quot;Dine gamle dager er nå&quot; was released on 16 June 2023. The song received favorable reviews from the Norwegian media.

==Style and lyrical themes==
Kaizers Orchestra have been grouped with various genres, including alternative rock, gypsy rock, balkan brass, folk and arena rock. They are regarded as one of Europe&#x27;s best live acts, with their 2002 Performance at Roskilde Festival earning them &quot;Concert of the Year&quot; by Danish media.

For the most part, lyrics and music is written by Janove Ottesen, although Geir Zahl has also contributed some compositions. The lyrics vary from album to album, and many of the songs&#x27; storylines are intertwined, with recurring characters being explored during the course of several songs. This led to the musical &quot;Sonny&quot; in November 2011, which is based on their first three albums. The lyrics of &quot;Ompa til du dør&quot; consist of stories of a handful of characters involving war, the resistance, and the mafia. Their second album, &quot;Evig Pint&quot;, consists of fewer characters and more focused, darker themes: life, death, betrayal, drugs, and once again, the mafia. Their third album, &quot;Maestro&quot;, focuses on things happening in a mental institution and the corruption involved.

For their fourth album, &quot;Maskineri&quot;, they attempted to break their tradition and made none of the songs connected; they also stopped using characters. The songs were still stories, but they had no connection with each other or their other albums. After the release of this album they decided to release their compilation album &quot;Våre demoner&quot;, which consisted of many older songs that were cleaned up, so the lyrical content of that was similar to their first three albums.

After &quot;Våre demoner&quot;, Kaizers Orchestra released the &quot;Violeta Violeta&quot; trilogy. The lyrics of which are based around five characters: a crazy mother, Beatrice; her daughter, Violeta; her father, Kenneth; Kenneth&#x27;s brother; and the girlfriend of Kenneth&#x27;s brother (an old friend of Beatrice and the maid of honor at Kenneth&#x27;s/Beatrice&#x27;s wedding), Cecilia. Violeta was taken from her mother, by her father, and the only way they can see each other is in their dreams. Janove has explained the lyrics are magic realism and they are similar to a Tim Burton film.

<text>The Death Valley pupfish (Cyprinodon salinus), also known as Salt Creek pupfish, is a small species of fish in the family Cyprinodontidae found only in Death Valley National Park, California, United States. There are two recognized subspecies: &quot;C. s. salinus&quot; and &quot;C. s. milleri&quot;. The Death Valley pupfish is endemic to two small, isolated locations and currently classified as endangered.

== Description ==

The Death Valley Pupfish is a small, silvery colored fish with 6–9 vertical dark bands on its sides. It has an average length of , with a recorded maximum of .

The males, often appearing in larger sizes compared to females, turn bright blue during mating season, April through October. The females, along with premature pupfish, tend to have tanned backs with iridescent, silvery sides. Both males and females have plump bodies with rounded fins, a squashed head and an upturned mouth. The pupfish can withstand harsh conditions that would kill other fish: water that is 4 times more saline than the ocean, hot water up to , and cold water down to .

==Distribution and habitat==

This species is known from only two locations in Death Valley: Salt Creek (subspecies &quot;salinus&quot;) at about below sea level, and Cottonball Marsh (subspecies &quot;milleri&quot;), at about below sea level. They are thought to be the remainders of a large ecosystem of fish species that lived in Lake Manly, which dried up at the end of the last ice age leaving the present-day Death Valley.

The Salt Creek subspecies is also found at River Springs and Soda Lake, in Death Valley National Park.

==Conservation==
The Death Valley pupfish has been classified as endangered by the IUCN because of its extremely restricted distribution (if the two extant locations were treated as a single unit, it would be considered critically endangered). Numbers of individuals at the locations are highly seasonally variable, and fluctuate with water level and flow volume. While the entire range of the species is located in a protected area, it may be under threat from accidental introduction of non-native species, local catastrophic events, and excessive pumping of the aquifer that feeds the habitat.

<text>The International Astronautical Federation (IAF) is an international space advocacy organization based in Paris, and founded in 1951 as a non-governmental organization to establish a dialogue between scientists around the world and to lay the information for international space cooperation. It has over 390 members from 68 countries across the world. They are drawn from space agencies, companies, universities, professional associations, museums, government organizations and learned societies. The IAF organizes the annual International Astronautical Congress (IAC). Pascale Ehrenfreund has served as the president of the IAF.

== History ==
After World War II, Heinz Gartmann, Gunter Loeser, and Heinz-Hermann Koelle formed the German Rocket Society. They contacted the British Interplanetary Society (BIS) and Groupement Astronautique Français. The French group&#x27;s leader, Alexandre Ananoff, organized the First International Congress for Astronautics in Paris, France, in September 1950. At the second congress in London, United Kingdom, in September 1951, the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) was organized; at the third congress in Stuttgart, West Germany, in 1952, the IAF constitution was adopted and the organization registered under Swiss Law.

== Events ==
=== International Astronautical Federation Congress (IAC) ===
The IAC is a space event and the largest put on by the organization, with approximately 6,000 participants each year. A different member of IAF is selected by IAF each year to host the IAC. An annual event held in September or October, the congress includes &quot;networking events, talks, and a technical program on advances in science and exploration, applications and operations, technology, infrastructure, and space and society.&quot; There are side events including the annual IAF Workshop with the support of the United Nations,[1] which takes place during the 2 days preceding the IAC.

=== IAF Global Conference ===
The IAF Global Conferences are organized annually. Each year they have a specific space-related topic and theme, and are held in alternating or new locations.

* IAF International Meeting for Members of Parliament - annual meeting for members of parliaments, it acts as an informal forum to discuss space matters. Lasting one day, the events has a keynote speech, and all politicians are allowed to make statements on their home country&#x27;s developments.
* The IAF Workshop - Organized with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), this event &quot;provides space emerging countries with capacity building opportunities in using space science, technologies, applications and exploration in support of sustainable economic, social and environmental development and on the role of industry&quot;.

== Awards ==
The IAF runs two large-scale awards schemes for young professionals and students: The Emerging Space Leaders (ESL) Grants, and the Young Space Leaders Recognition (YSL) Programme. This allows young people to attend the IAC free of charge, and have their travel, accommodation and costs paid whilst there.

Every year at the International Astronautical Congress, awards are given out: The main awards are the IAF World Space Award, the Allan D. Emil Memorial Award, the IAF Hall of Fame, the IAF Distinguished Service Award, the Franck J. Malina Astronautics Medal, the Luigi G. Napolitano Award, the AAAF Medals and the Hermann Oberth Medals.

=== World Space Award ===

The World Space Award is designated by the IAF as its &quot;most prestigious award&quot; and as the organization&#x27;s premier accolade, it is often described as the &quot;world&#x27;s highest aerospace award.&quot; The award is presented to an eminent individual or team at the IAC Congress, after a nomination process, that has made an &quot;exceptional impact to the progress of the world space activities&quot; by their outstanding contributions in the fields of space science, technology, medicine, law, or management.

=== Frank J. Malina Astronautics Medal ===
The Frank J. Malina Astronautics Medal is presented every year at the Congress of the IAF. The medal is presented annually, commencing in 1986, to an educator who has demonstrated excellence in taking the fullest advantage of the resources available to him/her to promote the study of astronautics and related space sciences.

The Frank J. Malina Award consists of the Malina commemorative medal and a certificate of citation, presented at the International Astronautical Federation Awards Banquet. The funding for the medal is by the Aerojet-General Corporation and administration for the medal done through the IAF&#x27;s Space Education and Outreach Committee.

== Publications ==
The IAF publishes proceedings from its meeting electronically, along with studies undertaken by IAF committees, and other reports.
