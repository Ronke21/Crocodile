<text>A boxed set or (its US name) box set is a set of items (for example, a compilation of books, musical recordings, films or television programs) traditionally packaged in a box, hence &#x27;boxed&#x27;, and offered for sale as a single unit.

==Music==
Artists and bands with a long and successful career often have anthology or &quot;essential&quot; collections of their music released as box sets. These often include rare and never-before-released tracks. Some box sets collect previously released singles or albums by a music artist, and often collect the complete discography of an artist, such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Oh, by the Way&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot; sets. Sometimes bands release expanded versions of their most successful albums, such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Immersion&quot; versions of their &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979) boxes. Pink Floyd have also released &quot;The Early Years 1965–1972&quot; box set, which features mostly unreleased material.

Other music box sets compile different artists from a particular genre such as big band jazz, 1960s rock and roll, or opera. They generally feature a collection of various hits from some of the top artists of a particular genre. The scope of such box sets varies widely, with some genre-specific box sets (such as one featuring rock music) focusing on a specific style (for instance, guitar rock or &quot;Summer of Love&quot; music). Two of the companies best known for making box sets are Legacy Recordings and Rhino Records; both have won multiple Grammy Awards. Prior to Rhino and Legacy, companies such as Time-Life Records and Reader&#x27;s Digest also issued box sets.

In rare cases, box sets contain all original material, such as the 11-disc set &quot;Blue Guitars&quot; by Chris Rea, &quot;In Search of The&quot;, a 13-disc set by Buckethead, or Klaus Schulze&#x27;s 10-disc set &quot;Contemporary Works I&quot;. Some box sets become best sellers, such as Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; (1990), George Strait&#x27;s &quot;Strait Out of the Box&quot; (1995), Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; (2004) and The Beatles&#x27; twin &quot;The Beatles Stereo Box Set&quot; and &quot;The Beatles in Mono&quot; discography box sets (2009).

In classical music, box sets often contain all works of a certain composer or all works in a certain genre, like symphonies or chamber music, performed by a certain orchestra, ensemble or conductor.

==Books==

Well-known authors and artists who have written or produced several related books or portfolios of fine art photography or other artistic mediums whose work is considered historically, culturally, or socially significant may have certain works sold as box sets. For example, one can buy box sets of the plays of Shakespeare, collection of J. R. R. Tolkien novels, or Ansel Adams photographic prints. There are now also digital boxed set collections, such as &quot;21 Shades of Night&quot;.

==Television and film==
Films, television and other video programs on Blu-ray and DVD are sometimes sold as boxed sets, as were certain titles on the now-discontinued VHS and LaserDisc formats. Such a boxed set might include an entire season or seasons, or the complete series, of a popular TV program, a collection of films by a well-known director or starring a well-known actor/actress, or a collection of films of a particular genre such as horror, sci-fi or westerns. Other criteria for boxed sets have included all films of a series such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series or the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, and a selection of adaptions of a particular author such as Stephen King or Jane Austen. Some boxed sets contain different versions of one film, as in the case of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;.

One of the most popular boxed sets of all time is &quot;The &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; Collection&quot; released in 1999 by New Line Platinum Series, which contained the original seven films, a bonus DVD containing special features titled &quot;The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia&quot;, two pairs of 3-D glasses for the last ten minutes of &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;, a commemorative booklet about the films titled &quot;The Nightmare is Alive&quot; and more. Other notable boxed sets include the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; &quot;Dragon Box&quot; sets, often considered to be the best release of the shows to date due to the high quality of the remasters and the plentiful number of features; the &quot;Shirley Temple Little Darling&quot; DVD collection, an 18-DVD boxed set of Shirley Temple films which were constantly advertised on TV for years as a &quot;limited time offer&quot;; and the &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; Trilogy: The Definitive Collection&quot; LaserDisc boxed set, which was one of the last home-video releases of the original trilogy before the special editions.

In the context of streaming services such as Netflix, the term &quot;boxed set&quot; often refers, particularly but not exclusively in Commonwealth English, to a series or season where all episodes are available to watch on demand, either in addition to or in place of traditional scheduling.

<doc id="246042" wikidata="Q537963" url="?curid=246042" title="Forgiveness">
<text>Forgiveness, in a psychological sense, is the intentional and voluntary process by which one who may have felt initially wronged, victimized, harmed, or hurt goes through a process of changing feelings and attitude regarding a given offender for their actions, and overcomes the impact of the offense, flaw, or mistake including negative emotions such as resentment or a desire for vengeance. Theorists differ in the extent to which they believe forgiveness also implies replacing the negative emotions with positive attitudes (i.e. an increased ability to tolerate the offender), or requires reconciliation with the offender. In certain legal contexts, forgiveness is a term for absolving someone of debt, loan, obligation, or other claims. Such legal usage can also be thought of as mercy, being distinct from forgiveness.

On the psychological level, forgiveness is different from simple condoning (viewing action as harmful, yet to be &quot;forgiven&quot; or overlooked for certain reasons of &quot;charity&quot;), excusing or pardoning (merely releasing the offender from responsibility for their actions), or forgetting (attempting to remove from one&#x27;s consciousness the memory of an offense). In some schools of thought, it involves a personal and &quot;voluntary&quot; effort at the self-transformation of one&#x27;s half of a relationship with another, such that one is restored to peace and ideally to what psychologist Carl Rogers has referred to as &quot;unconditional positive regard&quot; towards the other. Forgiveness can seal off past wrong doings and remove it from the present.

As a psychological concept and as a virtue, the obligation to forgive and the benefits of forgiveness have been explored in religious thought, moral philosophy, social sciences, and medicine. Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the person who forgives, which may include forgiving themselves. The concept of forgiveness can be in terms of the person forgiven or in terms of the relationship between the forgiver and the person forgiven. In most contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of restorative justice, and without any response on the part of the offender (for example, one may forgive a person who is or dead). In practical terms, it may be necessary for the offender to offer some form of acknowledgment, such as an , or to explicitly ask for forgiveness, for the wronged person to believe themselves able to forgive.

Social and political dimensions of forgiveness involve the strictly private and religious sphere of &quot;forgiveness&quot;. The notion of &quot;forgiveness&quot; is generally considered unusual in the political field. However, Hannah Arendt considers that the &quot;faculty of forgiveness&quot; has its place in public affairs. She believes that forgiveness can liberate resources both individually and collectively in the face of the irreparable, by freeing people to act in ways that are not merely reactive to the original wrong: &quot;Forgiving is the only reaction which does not merely re-act but acts a new and unexpectedly, unconditioned by the act which provoked it and therefore freeing from its consequences both the one who forgives and the one who is forgiven.&quot;

In a study conducted in Rwanda to examine the discourses and practices of forgiveness following the 1994 genocide, sociologist Benoit Guillou highlighted the extensive range of meanings associated with the term &quot;forgiveness&quot; and its underlying political nature. In the study&#x27;s findings, the author presented four primary aspects of forgiveness to facilitate a clearer comprehension of both its multifaceted applications and the circumstances in which forgiveness can contribute to the restoration of social connections.

Most world religions include teachings on forgiveness, and many of these provide a foundation for various modern traditions and practices of forgiveness. Some religious doctrines or philosophies emphasize the need for people to find divine forgiveness for their shortcomings; others place greater emphasis on the need for people to forgive one another; yet others make little or no distinction between human and divine forgiveness.

Forgiveness is interpreted in many ways by different people and cultures. This is important in relationship-oriented communication. When all parties share a mutual view of forgiveness then a relationship can be maintained. &quot;Understanding antecedents of forgiveness, exploring the physiology of forgiveness, and training people to become more forgiving all imply that we have a shared meaning for the term&quot;.

==The nature of forgiveness==

, there is no consensus for a psychological definition of forgiveness in the research literature. However, there is agreement that forgiveness is a process, and several models describing the process of forgiveness have been published, including one from a radical behavioral perspective.

Dr. Robert Enright from the University of Wisconsin–Madison founded the International Forgiveness Institute and initiated forgiveness studies. He developed a 20-Step Process Model of Forgiveness. In that model, to forgive someone, you should examine the wrong you suffered, who caused it, and the context in which it happened; consider the anger you feel about it, any shame or guilt associated with it, and how it has affected you; decide whether you want to advance into an attitude of forgiveness, and, if so: work on understanding, compassion, and acceptance, and make a gesture of reconciliation to the offender; then, reformulate the way you remember your experience of being wronged and of developing forgiveness in ways that healthily integrate this into your life story.

A longitudinal study showed that people who were generally more neurotic, angry, and hostile in life were less likely to forgive another person even after a long time had passed. They were more likely to avoid their transgressor and want to enact revenge upon them two and a half years after the transgression.

Studies show that people who forgive are happier and healthier than those who hold resentment. The first study to look at how forgiveness improves physical health discovered that when people think about forgiving an offender their cardiovascular and nervous system functioning improves. Another study found the more forgiving people were, the less they suffered from a wide range of illnesses. Less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.

Dr. Fred Luskin of Stanford University, author of &quot;Forgive for Good&quot;, presented evidence that forgiveness can be learned (i.e. is a teachable skill, with practice) based on research into the effects of teaching forgiveness. This research gave empirical support to the powerful, positive health effects of forgiveness. In three separate studies, including one with Catholics and Protestants from Northern Ireland whose family members were murdered in the political violence, he found that people who are taught how to forgive become less angry, feel less hurt, are more optimistic, become more forgiving in a variety of situations, and become more compassionate and self-confident. His studies show a reduction in experience of stress, in physical manifestations of stress, and an increase in vitality.

=== Ideas about what forgiveness is not ===

* Forgiveness is not condoning
* Forgiveness is not forgetting
* Forgiveness is not excusing (i.e. making reasons to explain away offender&#x27;s responsibility or free will)
* Forgiveness does not have to be religious or otherworldly
* Forgiveness is not minimizing your hurt
* Forgiveness is not reconciliation (i.e. reestablishing trust in the relationship)
* Forgiveness is not denying or suppressing anger; rather its focus is on resentment. In particular, to forgive it is healthy to acknowledge and express negative emotions, before you can forgive
* Forgiveness is not ignoring accountability or justice. In particular, punishment and compensation are independent of the choice to forgive (you can forgive, or not forgive, and still pursue punishment and/or compensation, regardless)
* Forgiveness is not pardoning; it cannot be granted or chosen by someone else
* Emotional forgiveness is not the same as decisional forgiveness or the expression of forgiveness. Expressing emotions (i.e., &quot;I am angry at you&quot; or &quot;I forgive you&quot;) is not the same as genuinely having or experiencing the emotions (i.e., people can deny, mistake, or lie about their emotional experience to another person while genuinely feeling something else instead)
* Although this is heavily debated, emotional forgiveness is for you, not the offender (i.e., unless you choose to make it so: by expressing it, or by trying to reconcile)

=== The timeliness of forgiveness ===
Psychologist Wanda Malcolm, in &quot;Women&#x27;s Reflections on the Complexities of Forgiveness&quot;, outlines reasons why forgiveness takes time: when working on self (care/healing) takes priority (i.e. therapy, medical injuries, etc.), when issues of safety need to be addressed, and where facilitating forgiveness may be premature immediately after an interpersonal offense. Malcolm explains that &quot;premature efforts to facilitate forgiveness may be a sign of our reluctance to witness our client’s pain and suffering and may unwittingly reinforce the client’s belief that the pain and suffering is too much to bear and must be suppressed or avoided.&quot;

Worthington &quot;et al.&quot; observed that &quot;anything done to promote forgiveness has little impact unless substantial time is spent at helping participants think through and emotionally experience their forgiveness&quot;. Efforts to facilitate forgiveness may be premature and even harmful immediately after an interpersonal injury.

==Forgiveness in philosophical thought==
The philosopher Joseph Butler (&quot;Fifteen Sermons&quot;) defined forgiveness as &quot;overcoming of resentment, the overcoming of moral hatred, as a speech act, and as forbearance&quot;. In his 1962 lecture on &quot;Freedom and Resentment&quot;&#x27;, philosopher P. F. Strawson described forgiveness as &quot;a rather unfashionable subject in moral philosophy&quot; at that time.

== Religious views ==
Religion can affect how someone chooses to forgive—for example, through religious activity, religious affiliation and teachings, and imitation.

===Abrahamic===
==== Judaism ====

In Judaism, if a person causes harm, but then sincerely and honestly apologizes to the wronged individual and tries to rectify the wrong, the wronged individual is encouraged, but not required, to grant forgiveness:

In Judaism, one must go &quot;to those he has harmed&quot; to be entitled to forgiveness. One who sincerely apologizes three times for a wrong committed against another has fulfilled their obligation to seek forgiveness. This means that in Judaism a person cannot obtain forgiveness from God for wrongs they have done to other people. This also means that, unless the victim forgave the perpetrator before he died, murder is unforgivable in Judaism, and they will answer to God for it, though the victims&#x27; family and friends can forgive the murderer for the grief they caused them. The &quot;Tefila Zaka&quot; meditation, which is recited just before Yom Kippur, closes with the following:

Thus the &quot;reward&quot; for forgiving others is not God&#x27;s forgiveness for wrongs done to others, but rather help in obtaining forgiveness from the other person.

Sir Jonathan Sacks, chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, summarized: &quot;It is not that God forgives, while human beings do not. To the contrary, we believe that just as only God can forgive sins against God, so only human beings can forgive sins against human beings.&quot;

Jews observe a Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, on the day before God makes decisions regarding what will happen during the coming year. Just prior to Yom Kippur, Jews ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for God&#x27;s forgiveness for the transgressions they have made against God in the prior year. Sincere repentance is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged.

==== Christianity ====


Forgiveness is central to Christian ethics. The prayer Jesus taught his followers to recite begs God to &quot;forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors&quot;. When Peter asked Jesus how often to forgive someone, Jesus said &quot;Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times&quot;. Jesus warned that God&#x27;s forgiveness for your sins depends on your forgiveness towards others. In one of the gospels, Jesus during his crucifixion asks God to forgive those who crucified him.

Hannah Arendt stated that Jesus was &quot;the discoverer of the role of forgiveness in the realm of human affairs.&quot;

=====God&#x27;s forgiveness=====
Unlike in Judaism, in Christianity God can forgive sins committed by people against people, since he can forgive every sin except for the eternal sin, and forgiveness from one&#x27;s victim is not necessary for salvation. The Parable of the Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God&#x27;s forgiveness for those who repent. Jesus asked for God&#x27;s forgiveness of those who crucified him. &quot;Then Jesus said, &#x27;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.&#x27;&quot; – 

=====Forgiving others=====
Forgiving offenses is among the spiritual works of mercy, and forgiving others begets being forgiven by God. Considering Mark 11:25, and Matthew 6:14–15, that follows the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, &quot;For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,&quot; forgiveness is not an option to a Christian; rather one must forgive to be a Christian. Forgiveness in Christianity is a manifestation of submission to Christ and fellow believers.

In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of the importance of forgiving or showing mercy toward others. This is based on the belief that God forgives sins through faith in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ in his death (1 John 2:2) and that, therefore, Christians should forgive others (Ephesians 4:32). Jesus used the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matthew 18:21–35) to show that His followers (represented in the parable by the servant) should forgive because God (represented by the king) forgives much more.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus repeatedly spoke of forgiveness: &quot;Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.&quot; &quot;So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift.&quot; &quot;Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.&quot; &quot;Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.&quot; &quot;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.&quot;

Elsewhere, it is said &quot;Then Peter came and said to him, &#x27;Lord, if my brother or sister sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?&#x27; Jesus said to him, &#x27;Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times.&#x27;&quot;

=====Catholicism=====

======Divine Forgiveness======
The Catholic Church believes in God&#x27;s grace of forgiveness of sin and in the necessity of contrition (repentance) for said forgiveness. God commands people to pray for forgiveness (&quot;And forgive us our trespasses&quot;) because he wants to forgive sin, and for the same reason he grants the graces of contrition and prayer. When God forgives a sin he - despite his omniscience - forgets about the sin, which is why at the particular and general judgments only unforgiven sins will be judged. God can forgive every and any sin, just as he did by his death on the Cross, but those who refuse said forgiveness at the moment of death commit the eternal sin of final impenitence. Final impenitence is not unforgivable because of God, but because the person refuses to repent (and so refuse forgiveness). God grants his graces of contrition, prayer, and forgiveness to everyone, thanks to his death on the Cross. Contrition is the beginning of forgiveness: God makes you repent so he can forgive you and rejoice over you, and upon forgiving you God will rejoice with you, as God forgives you for that purpose. God forgives you because the whole Trinity forgives you, since the Father personally forgives you and the Son personally forgives you and the Holy Spirit personally forgives you, for everything comes to you from the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit. 

There are sacramental and non-sacramental ways to obtain God&#x27;s forgiveness of sin. Sacramental ways include: Baptism (which forgives original sin, all venial and mortal sin, and all temporary and eternal punishment), Confession (which forgives all venial and mortal sin and all eternal punishment), the Eucharist (which forgives all venial sin), and the Anointing of the Sick (which forgives all venial and mortal sin and all eternal punishment). Non-sacramental ways include: the works of mercy and perfect contrition. Works of mercy can also be offered up for the partial forgiveness of the dead in Purgatory, and partial and plenary indulgences can respectively obtain partial and full (plenary) forgiveness of temporary punishment - either for the person who obtains it or for the dead in Purgatory. The Apostolic Pardon is a plenary indulgence that Catholics, dying in sanctifying grace, can obtain for themselves. 

God is not bound by the church, so penitent non-Catholics and penitent excommunicated Catholics can obtain forgiveness - albeit by a means known only to God, who forgave the Penitent Thief just as he said: &quot;Today you will be with me in Paradise.&quot; Feeneyism (the belief that people outside the church cannot be saved from sin or hell) and double predestination (the belief that some people are predestined to commit sin and/or go to hell) are heresies.

Divine forgiveness is infinitely greater than human forgiveness because it can grant preservative redemption (the Immaculate Conception of Mary and the fruit of Holy Communion) and purge sin via deification. According to Catherine of Siena, God told her that he is a manic pixie dream girl (a beautiful, energetic, high on life, and friendly supernatural being) who&#x27;s very nature is to be so madly in love with mankind that he will stop at nothing to bring souls into heaven. God also gave Catherine a picture of sacramental absolution: Divine mercy is an infinite furnace that is always enthusiastically ready to consume rocks, that sin is a finite rock thrown into the furnace (thrown via confession), and that the furnace can effortlessly destroy every rock in history and creation without exhaustion (destroyed via absolution).

======Human Forgiveness======
The Catholic Church believes the works of mercy are a means of grace because they are the fruit of contrition. Among the spiritual works of mercy is forgiveness of sins committed against oneself. Not because people can forgive like God, but imitate him. Forgiving others is not arbitrary or hollow, for one forgives honestly and out of love - just like God. Forgiveness reconciles people, softens hardened hearts, heals human misery, makes reparation for the sin of theft, comforts Jesus in his Passion, glorifies God, and testifies to the existence and goodness of God. 

Pope Benedict XVI, on a visit to Lebanon in 2012, insisted that peace must be based on mutual forgiveness: &quot;Only forgiveness, given and received, can lay lasting foundations for reconciliation and universal peace&quot;.

Pope Francis during a General Audience explained forgiving others as God forgives oneself: &quot;We are forgiven as we forgive others.&quot;

==== Islam ====
Islam teaches that Allah is &quot;The Oft-Forgiving&quot;, and is the original source of all forgiveness ( ). Seeking forgiveness from Allah with repentance is a virtue.

Islam recommends forgiveness, because Allah values forgiveness. There are numerous verses in Quran and the Hadiths recommending forgiveness. Islam also allows revenge to the extent of the harm done, but forgiveness is encouraged, with a promise of reward from Allah.

 ( is another term for forgiveness in Islam; it occurs 35 times in Quran, and in some Islamic theological studies, it is used interchangeably with . means to pardon, to excuse for a fault or an offense. According to Muhammad Amanullah, forgiveness () in Islam is derived from three wisdoms. The first and most important wisdom of forgiveness is that it is merciful when the victim or guardian of the victim accepts money instead of revenge. The second wisdom of forgiveness is that it increases the honor and prestige of the one who forgives. Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness, humiliation or dishonor. Rather, forgiveness is honorable, it raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah, and it enables a forgiver to enter paradise. The third wisdom of forgiveness is that, according to scholars such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi, forgiveness expiates () the forgiver from the sins they may have committed at other occasions in life. Forgiveness is a form of charity (). Forgiveness comes from (piety), a quality of God-fearing people.

Forgiveness is also describe in the form of safh (arabic: صفح), which is the root word of page in Arabic, the term can be translated as excusing or turning a page or turning the other cheek. It appears several times alongside the terms Afw and ghufran.

==== Bahá&#x27;í Faith ====
In the Bahá&#x27;í Writings, this explanation is given of how to be forgiving toward others:
===Dharmic===
==== Buddhism ====
In Buddhism, forgiveness prevents harmful thoughts from causing havoc on one&#x27;s mental well-being. Buddhism recognizes that feelings of hatred and ill-will leave a lasting effect on our mind-karma. Buddhism encourages the cultivation of thoughts that leave a more wholesome effect. &quot;In contemplating the law of karma, we realize that it is not a matter of seeking revenge but of practicing and forgiveness, for the victimizer is, truly, the most unfortunate of all.&quot; When resentments have already arisen, the Buddhist view is to calmly proceed to release them by going back to their roots. Buddhism centers on release from delusion and suffering through meditation and receiving insight into the nature of reality.
Buddhism questions the reality of the passions that make forgiveness necessary as well as the reality of the objects of those passions. &quot;If we haven’t forgiven, we keep creating an identity around our pain, and that is what is reborn. That is what suffers.&quot;

Buddhism places much emphasis on the concepts of (loving-kindness), (compassion), (sympathetic joy), and (equanimity), as a means to avoiding resentments in the first place. These reflections are used to understand the context of suffering in the world, both our own and the suffering of others.

==== Dharma ====

In Vedic literature and epics of Hinduism, or (Sanskrit: ) and fusion words based on it, name the concept of forgiveness. The word is often combined with (tenderness), (kindness), and (, compassion) in Sanskrit texts. In the Rigveda, forgiveness is discussed in verses dedicated to the deity Varuna, both the context of the one who has done wrong and the one who is wronged. Forgiveness is considered one of the six cardinal virtues in Hindu Dharma.

The theological basis for forgiveness in Hindu Dharma is that a person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, and of anger, and unresolved emotions that affect their present as well as future. In Hindu Dharma, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, utilizing charity, purification, fasting, rituals, and meditative introspection.

Forgiveness is further refined in Hindu Dharma by rhetorically contrasting it in feminine and masculine forms. In the feminine form, one form of forgiveness is explained through Lakshmi (called Goddess Sri in some parts of India); the other form is explained in the masculine form through her husband Vishnu. Feminine Lakshmi forgives even when the one who does wrong does not repent. Masculine Vishnu, on the other hand, forgives only when the wrongdoer repents. In Hindu Dharma, the feminine forgiveness granted without repentance by Lakshmi is higher and more noble than the masculine forgiveness granted only after there is repentance. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Sita – the wife of King Rama – is symbolically eulogized for forgiving a crow even as it harms her. Later in the epic Ramayana, she is eulogized again for forgiving those who harass her while she has been kidnapped in Lanka. Many other Hindu stories discuss forgiveness with or without repentance.

The concept of forgiveness is treated in extensive debates within Hindu literature. In some Hindu texts, certain sins and intentional acts are debated as naturally unforgivable, for example, murder and rape; these ancient scholars argue whether blanket forgiveness is morally justifiable in every circumstance, and whether forgiveness encourages crime, disrespect, social disorder, and people not taking you seriously.

Other ancient Hindu texts highlight that forgiveness is not the same as reconciliation. Forgiveness in Hindu Dharma does not necessarily require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind, and letting go of the harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and to be able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (a &quot;dharmic&quot; life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes the essence of one&#x27;s personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger ().

Other epics and ancient literature of Hindu Dharma discuss forgiveness. For example:



====Jainism====

In Jainism, forgiveness is one of the main virtues that Jains should cultivate. , or supreme forgiveness, forms part of one of the ten characteristics of . In the Jain prayer, () Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from or single-sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities. Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, —a Prakrit language phrase literally meaning &quot;may all the evil that has been done be fruitless.&quot; During —the last day of Jain festival —Jains utter the phrase after . As a matter of ritual, they personally greet their friends and relatives with , seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute may be carried beyond , and letters and telephone calls are made to the outstation friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.

 also contains the following prayer:

(I ask pardon of all creatures, may all creatures pardon me.
May I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.)
In their daily prayers and , Jains recite , seeking forgiveness from all creatures while involved in routine activities:

May you, O Revered One! Voluntarily permit me. I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organisms, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider webs, and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, or five-sensed. I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with another, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another, or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.
Jain texts quote Māhavīra on forgiveness:

The code of conduct among monks requires them to ask forgiveness for all transgressions:
===Other===
 is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with prayer. Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the South Pacific, including Samoa, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Traditionally is practiced by healing priests or among family members of a person who is physically ill. Modern versions are performed within the family by a family elder, or by the individual alone.

== Popular recognition ==
The need to forgive is widely recognized, but people are often at a loss for ways to accomplish it. For example, in a large representative sampling of American people on various religious topics in 1988, the Gallup Organization found that 94% said it was important to forgive, but 85% said they needed some outside help to be able to forgive. However, not even regular prayer was found to be effective.

Akin to forgiveness is mercy, so even if a person is not able to complete the forgiveness process they can still show mercy, especially when so many wrongs are done out of weakness rather than malice. The Gallup poll revealed that the only effective mediator was engagement in &quot;meditative prayer&quot;.

Forgiveness as a tool has been extensively used in such areas as restorative justice programs, after the abolition of apartheid in the truth and reconciliation process, among victims and perpetrators of Rwandan genocide, in response to the violence in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Northern Ireland conflict. This has been documented in the film &quot;Beyond Right and Wrong: Stories of Justice and Forgiveness&quot; (2012).

Forgiveness is associated with the theory of emotion because it draws from a person&#x27;s emotional connection with the situation. Forgiveness is something that most people are taught to understand and practice at a young age.

== In relationships ==

Forgiveness in marriage is important. When two people can forgive each other this contributes to a happy marriage. Forgiveness can help prevent problems from growing and aid in conflict resolution. In a dating relationship as opposed to a married relationship, couples are less likely to acknowledge transgressions surrounding the relationship and more likely to forgive each other without conditions, as well as being more understanding towards their partners.

Depending on the severity of the transgression, partners may engage in different communication behaviors to seek or grant forgiveness.

Merolla distinguished two types of forgiveness, conditional and indirect forgiveness, and direct forgiveness.

Direct and conditional forgiveness involve discussion about the incident, where the forgiving person is straightforward and clear in telling the offender that they forgive them, usually saying something such as &quot;I forgive you&quot;, or &quot;You are forgiven&quot;. 

Indirect forgiveness reflects on minimizing the conflict. With this type of forgiveness, forgivers do not make it explicitly clear to their offender that they are forgiven, rather it is just &#x27;understood&#x27;. This could come from tactics such as humor, eye contact, hugging, or reverting back to acting normal, or how things were before the transgression. Therefore indirect forgiveness is less appropriate following a more severe incident that is usually followed by great hurt and anger, and more appropriate for smaller transgressions like minor disagreements or fights.

There is also conditional forgiveness, in which people forgive their offender, but with conditions. The offender is forgiven in this case, but there are stipulations surrounding the forgivers&#x27; forgiveness. This could be a scenario where the offender makes a deal not to do something again that might have led to the transgression, such as drinking alcohol.

In a 2005 study, researchers investigated whether forgiveness is important in a marriage. When does forgiveness usually accrue—before an argument or after an argument? Does forgiveness take a role when a person breaks a promise? etc. Researchers found six components that were related to forgiveness in marriage: satisfaction, ambivalence, conflict, attributions, empathy, and commitment.

Sheldon et al. conducted a study in which they surveyed both married and dating couples on past relational transgressions, the communication strategies used to grant forgiveness, the degree of forgiveness within a specific relationship, and the ratings of relationship satisfaction. 

The severity of the transgression was measured by three different items, and rated on a scale of severity. Of the forgiving strategies, five emerged and were rated on the frequency of their use. Forgiveness tendency (how likely couples were to forgive) was measured in five terms and rated on how likely couples were to agree to forgive, and relationship satisfaction was measured using Hendrick’s Relationship Assessment Scale, which aimed to help understand how satisfied couples were with their relationship after having gone through some sort of transgression and then the forgiveness process. 

Interestingly, the results of this study showed in married partners, the tendency to forgive was positively related to the use of minimizing and nonverbal forgiveness strategies. But, when it came to the severity of the transgression, the tendency or likelihood of forgiveness had no relation to any use of any given forgiveness strategy. 

On the other hand, in dating relationships, the tendency to forgive was positively correlated with the use of nonverbal and explicit strategy, as was the transgression severity. Overall, this study showed that both married and dating couples who experienced similar amounts of transgressions did not differ largely in their satisfaction in the relationship after the forgiveness had occurred.

People in a relationship believe that forgiveness means you must forget what had happened. When couples forgive their spouses they sometimes need help from professionals to overcome the pain that might remain. Researchers described differences between how each individual perceives the situation based on who is in pain and who caused the pain.

The act and effects of forgiveness can vary depending on the relationship status between people. Whether you are married, friends, or acquaintances, the process of forgiving is similar but not completely the same.

===The model of forgiveness===

&quot;Enright&#x27;s model of forgiveness has received empirical support and sees forgiveness as a journey through four phases&quot;:

; Uncovering phase: Emphases exploring the pain that the person has experienced.
; Decision phase: The nature of forgiveness is discussed. The person commits that they will try to forgive the transgressor.
; Work phase: The focus shifts to the transgressor to gain insight and understanding.
; Deepening phase: The victim moves toward resolution, becoming aware that he/she is not alone, having been the recipient of others&#x27; forgiveness, and finds meaning and purpose in the forgiveness process.

When married couples argue they tend to focus on who is right and who is wrong.

===Recommendation and interventions===

The researchers also came up with recommendations for practitioners and interventions to help married individuals communicate with each other, to resolve problems, and to forgive each other more easily. For example, people should explore and understand what forgiveness means before starting any intervention because preconceived ideas of forgiveness can cause problems with couples being open to forgiving. For example, a person not forgiving their spouse out of fear that the spouse might think that they are weak can cause a conflict.

In 2001, Charlotte vanOyen-Witvliet asked people to think about someone who had hurt, wronged, or offended them. As they thought to answer, she observed their reaction. She observed their blood pressure, heart rate, facial muscle tension, and sweat gland activity. Recalling the grudge increased the candidates’ blood pressure and heart rate, and they sweated more. The rumination was stressful and unpleasant. When they adopted forgiveness, they showed no more of an anxiety reaction than normal wakefulness produces.

== Interventions ==
Psychology researchers agree that the purpose of forgiveness interventions is to decrease the overall negative effect associated with the stimulus and increase the individual&#x27;s positive affect.

The incorporation of forgiveness into therapy has been lacking, but has gained popularity. The growth of forgiveness in psychology has given rise to the study of forgiveness interventions.

A meta-analysis of group-based forgiveness interventions examined how well they increase self-reported forgiveness (or decrease &quot;unforgiveness&quot;). It concluded that &quot;The data appear to speak clearly: Forgiveness interventions are effective.&quot;

=== Different types ===
There are various forms of forgiveness interventions. One is where patients are forced to confront the entity that prevents them from forgiving by using introspective techniques and expressing this to the therapist. Another is getting the person to try to see things from the offender&#x27;s point of view, so that they may understand the reasoning behind the offender&#x27;s actions. If they can do this, they might be able to forgive the offender more easily.

Researchers have studied forgiveness interventions in relationships and whether or not prayer increases forgiveness. One study found that praying for a friend or thinking positive thoughts about that person every day for four weeks positively boosts the chances of forgiving that friend or partner, which leads to a better relationship.

=== Contrary evidence ===
There is, however, conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions, and some researchers have taken a critical approach to the forgiveness intervention approach to therapy.

Critics argued that forgiveness interventions may cause an increase in negative affect because they try to inhibit the person&#x27;s feelings towards the offender. This can result in the person feeling negatively towards themself. This approach implies that the negative emotions the person is feeling are unacceptable and feelings of forgiveness are correct and acceptable. This might inadvertently promote feelings of shame and contrition in the person.

Wanda Malcolm, a registered psychologist, states: &quot;It is not a good idea to make forgiveness an a-priori goal of therapy&quot;. Steven Stosny asserts that you must heal first and then forgive ( forgive then heal); that fully acknowledging the grievance (both what actions were harmful, and naming the emotions the victim felt as a response to the offender&#x27;s actions) is an essential first step before forgiveness can occur.

Some researchers worry that forgiveness interventions promote unhealthy relationships. They worry that individuals with toxic relationships will continue to forgive those who continuously commit wrong acts towards them, when in fact they should be distancing themselves from those sorts of people.

Several studies showcase high effectiveness rates of forgiveness interventions when done continuously over a long period. But some researchers have found these interventions ineffective when done over short periods.

=== Children ===
Some studies looked at the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions on young children, including several cross-cultural studies. One looked at forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them, finding an effect of such interventions on the children.

===Older adults===

Older adults who receive forgiveness interventions report higher levels of forgiveness than those who did not receive treatment. Forgiveness treatments resulted in lower depression, stress, and anger than no-treatment conditions. Forgiveness interventions also enhance positive psychological aspects. This was regardless of the specific intervention model or format (group or individual).

== Mental health ==
Survey data from 2000 showed that 61% of those participants who were part of a small religious group reported that the group helped them be more forgiving. People who reported that their religious groups promoted forgiveness also related success in overcoming addictions, guilt, and perceiving encouragement when feeling discouraged.

Mindfulness may play a role as a mediator in the relationship between forgiveness and health outcomes. When combined with mindfulness, forgiveness has a beneficial impact on physical health. However, the effects of forgiveness on health are contingent upon the presence and practice of mindfulness.

Self-forgiveness is an important part of self-acceptance and mental health in stages of life. Failing to achieve self-forgiveness can have negative effects on mental health. Among the elderly, self-forgiveness often involves introspection about past wrongdoings, aiming to prevent their recurrence; this process contributes to enhancing their authentic self-concept. When people successfully learn from transgressions, they may experience improved mental health.

Self-forgiveness can reduce feelings of guilt and shame associated with hypersexual behavior. Hypersexual behaviour can cause distress and life problems. Self-forgiveness may help individuals reduce hypersexual negative behaviours that cause problems.

Self-forgiveness may be associated with procrastination; self-forgiveness allows a person to overcome the negative effects linked to earlier behaviour and adopt proactive approaches toward similar tasks. Embracing self-forgiveness in the context of procrastination can enhance self-esteem and mental well-being, potentially leading to a reduction in procrastination tendencies.

The self-help book &quot;Forgiveness and Health: Scientific Evidence and Theories Relating Forgiveness to Better Health&quot; details the benefits and the mental, physical, and psychological results of forgiveness. Stress relief may be the chief factor that connects forgiveness and well-being. Levels of stress go down when levels of forgiveness rise, resulting in a decrease in mental health symptoms.

Forgiveness lifts a burden, as the forgiver no longer feels anger or hatred toward the transgressor, and may better understand the transgressor. This improves their health and outlook.

A meta-analysis of several controlled studies of forgiveness-oriented psychological interventions tried to determine whether certain classes of intervention helped people to forgive, and also whether this helped their emotional health in general. It found strong support for forgiveness interventions that helped people go through a multi-step process of forgiveness, but no support for forgiveness interventions that were designed merely to help people &quot;decide to&quot; forgive.

Another meta-analysis examined how forgiveness interventions affected depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, and concluded that &quot;interventions designed to promote forgiveness are more effective at helping participants achieve forgiveness and hope and reduce depression and anxiety than either no treatment or alternative treatments.&quot;

==Physical health==
Some studies claim that there is no correlation, either positive or negative between forgiveness and physical health, and others show a positive correlation.

===Evidence supporting a correlation===
People characterized by the personality trait of forgiveness tend to experience better physical health. A study focusing on relationships revealed that the level of forgiveness exhibited by individuals had a discernible impact on their physical well-being, regardless of whether they were in positive or negative relationships.

People who decide to genuinely forgive someone also have better physical health. This is due to the relationship between forgiveness and stress reduction. Forgiveness prevents poor physical health and manages good physical health.

People who choose to forgive another have lower blood pressure and lower cortisol levels than those who do not. This is theorized to be due to forgiveness and suggests forgiveness is an evolutionarily-selected trait. Direct influences of forgiveness include: Reducing hostility (which is inversely correlated with physical health), and that unforgiveness may degrade the immune system because it puts stress on the individual. Indirect influences are more related to forgiveness as a personality trait and include: people who are forgiving may have more social support and less stressful marriages, and forgiveness may be related to other personality traits that correlate with physical health.

Forgiveness may also correlate with physical health because hostility is associated with poor coronary performance. Unforgiveness is a sort of hostility, and forgiveness is letting go of hostility. Heart patients who are treated with therapy that includes forgiveness to reduce hostility have improved cardiac health compared to those who are treated with medicine alone.
Forgiveness may also lead to an improvement in an individual&#x27;s perception of their own physical health. This correlation applies to both self-forgiveness and other-forgiveness but is especially true of self-forgiveness. Individuals who are more capable of forgiving themselves have better perceived physical health.

People who forgive can have healthier hearts, fewer depression symptoms, and less anxiety. Forgiveness can help mental health, especially with people who have mental disorders. Forgiveness can also improve the immune system.

===Criticisms===

Forgiveness studies have been refuted by critics who claim that there is no direct correlation between forgiveness and physical health. Forgiveness, due to the reduction of directed anger, contributes to mental health, and mental health contributes to physical health, but there is no evidence that forgiveness itself directly improves physical health.

Most of the studies on forgiveness cannot isolate it as an independent variable in an individual&#x27;s well-being, so it is difficult to prove causation.

Although there is limited research directly linking forgiveness to physical health, there are certain factors that suggest a potential connection. This is particularly relevant to physiological indicators and how the process of forgiveness may affect the body&#x27;s responses in various situations throughout daily life.

Research into the correlation between physical health and forgiveness has been criticized for being too focused on unforgiveness. Research shows more about what hostility and unforgiveness contribute to poor health than it shows about what forgiveness contributes to good health. Unforgiving or holding grudges can contribute to adverse health outcomes by perpetuating anger and heightening SNS arousal and cardiovascular reactivity. Expression of anger has been strongly associated with chronically elevated blood pressure and with the aggregation of platelets, which may increase vulnerability to heart disease.

== Self-forgiveness ==

Self-forgiveness happens in response to situations in which someone has done something they perceive to be morally wrong and that they consider themselves to be responsible for. Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the wrongdoer associates with the wrongful action, which can include guilt, regret, remorse, blame, shame, self-hatred and/or self-contempt.

Major life events that include trauma can cause individuals to experience feelings of guilt or self-hatred. People can reflect on their behaviours to determine if their actions are moral. In situations of trauma, people may self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life. Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where they hurt others. Self-forgiveness has a moderating effect between depression and suicidality. this suggests that self-forgiveness (up to a point) is protective against suicide, hinting at possible prevention strategies.

=== Therapeutic model===
People can unintentionally cause harm or offence to one another. It is important that individuals recognize when this happens, and, in the process of making amends, to self-forgive. The ability to forgive oneself can benefit a person&#x27;s emotional and mental well-being. The ability to forgive oneself for past offences can lessen negative emotions such as shame and guilt, and can increase positive practices such as self-kindness and self-compassion. However, the process of self-forgiveness may be misinterpreted and therefore not accurately completed. This could lead to increased feelings of regret or self-blame. To avoid this, and to increase the positive benefits associated with genuine self-forgiveness, a specific therapeutic model of self-forgiveness can be used to encourage genuine self-forgiveness. The proposed model has four key elements: responsibility, remorse, restoration, and renewal: 
# Responsibility is the first necessary step towards genuine self-forgiveness. To avoid the negative effect associated with emotions such as overwhelming guilt or regret, offenders must first recognize that they have hurt another person, and accept responsibility for their actions. 
# Once the person accepts responsibility, it is natural for them to experience feelings of remorse or guilt. However, these feelings can be genuinely processed and expressed. 
# Restoration allows the offending person to make the necessary amends to the person(s) they have hurt.
# Is renewal, the offending person can genuinely forgive himself/herself for their past transgressions and can engage in more positive and meaningful behaviors such as self-compassion and self-kindness. 
The process of self-forgiveness is not always applicable for every person. For example, people who have not caused others any harm or wrongdoing, but instead suffer from negative emotions such as self-hatred or self-pity—such as victims of assault—might attempt self-forgiveness for their perceived offences. However, this would not be the process necessary for them to make their amends. Additionally, offenders who continue to offend while attempting to forgive themselves for past offences demonstrate a reluctance to genuinely complete the four stages necessary for self-forgiveness. It is important to first gather exterior information about the persons&#x27;s perceived offences as well as their needs and motivation for self-forgiveness.

== Unapologetic forgiveness ==
To be unapologetic is to refuse to apologize for or even recognize wrongdoings. &quot;[T]he relationship between apologies and the adjectives &#x27;apologetic&#x27; and &#x27;unapologetic&#x27; is not quite so straightforward.&quot; Choosing to forgive someone or not correlates with whether or not that person is truly sorry for their actions. Forgiving a person who does not seem remorseful for their actions can be difficult, but may loosen the grip the person has over you. Intrusive thoughts can cause the person who wants to forgive to have feelings of low self-worth and to endure a traumatic phase due to that person&#x27;s actions. Going through a negative experience can cause long term trauma. A person may benefit from letting go and accepting what has happened. Letting go does not erase what the person did, but forgiveness can lead to inner-peace from the lack of negative emotion within. Despite the other person not apologizing sincerely, forgiving them may be the solution to problems and result in loving one&#x27;s self.

Jean Hampton sees the decision to forgive the unrepentant wrongdoer as expressing a commitment &quot;to see a wrongdoer in a new, more favorable light&quot; as one who is not completely rotten or morally dead.

<doc id="246043" wikidata="Q488085" url="?curid=246043" title="Kindness">
<text>Kindness is a type of behavior marked by acts of generosity, consideration, rendering assistance, or concern for others, without expecting praise or reward in return. It is a subject of interest in philosophy, religion, and psychology.

In Book II of &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle defines kindness as &quot;helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped&quot;. Friedrich Nietzsche considered kindness and love to be the &quot;most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse&quot;. Kindness is one of the Knightly Virtues. In Meher Baba&#x27;s teachings, God is synonymous with kindness: &quot;God is so kind that it is impossible to imagine His unbounded kindness!&quot;

==History==
In English, the word &quot;kindness&quot; dates from approximately 1300, though the word&#x27;s sense evolved to its current meanings in the late 1300s.

==In society==
Human mate choice studies suggest that both men and women value kindness in their prospective mates, along with intelligence, physical appearance, attractiveness, and age.

==In psychology==
Studies at Yale University used games with babies to conclude that kindness is inherent to human beings. There are similar studies about the root of empathy in infancy – with motor mirroring developing in the early months of life, and leading (optimally) to the concern shown by children for their peers in distress.

Barbara Taylor and Adam Phillips stressed the element of necessary realism in adult kindness, as well as the way &quot;real kindness changes people in the doing of it, often in unpredictable ways&quot;.
Behaving kindly may improve a person&#x27;s measurable well-being. Many studies have tried to test the hypothesis that doing something kind makes a person better off. A meta-analysis of 27 such studies found that the interventions studied (usually measuring short-term effects after brief acts of kindness, in WEIRD research subjects) supported the hypothesis that acting more kindly improves your well-being.

==Weaponized kindness==
Some thinkers have suggested that kindness can be weaponized to discourage enemies:

==Teaching kindness==
Kindness is most often taught from parents to children and is learned through observation and some direct teaching. Studies have shown that through programs and interventions kindness can be taught and encouraged during the first 20 years of life. Further studies show that kindness interventions can help improve well-being with comparable results as teaching gratitude. Similar findings have shown that organizational level teaching of kindness can improve the well-being of adults in college.

<text>UN/LOCODE, the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations, is a geographic coding scheme developed and maintained by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in trade and transport with functions such as seaports, rail and road terminals, airports, Postal Exchange Office and border crossing points. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000 locations. The version from 2011 contained codes for about 82,000 locations.

==Structure==
UN/LOCODEs have five characters. The first two letters code a country by the table defined in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. The three remaining characters code a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used, excluding &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; to avoid confusion with the letters &quot;O&quot; and &quot;I&quot; respectively.

For each country there can be a maximum of 17,576 entries using only letters (26×26×26), or 39,304 entries using letters and digits (34×34×34).

For the US, the letter combinations have almost all been exhausted. So in 2006, the Secretariat added 646 entries with a digit as the last character.

==Loose consistency with existing IATA airport codes==
For airports, the three letters following the country code are not always identical to the IATA airport code. According to the Secretariat note for Issue 2006-2, there are 720 locations showing a different IATA code.

==Official UN/LOCODE tables==
UN/LOCODEs are released as a table. An individual revision is officially referred to as an &quot;issue&quot;. A discussion of the table&#x27;s structure follows.

===Examples===

<text>A prediction (Latin &quot;præ-&quot;, &quot;before,&quot; and &quot;dictum&quot;, &quot;something said&quot;) or [[Prediction|forecast]] is a statement about a future event or about future data. Predictions are often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge of forecasters. There is no universal agreement about the exact difference between &quot;prediction&quot; and &quot;estimation&quot;; different authors and disciplines ascribe different connotations.

Future events are necessarily uncertain, so guaranteed accurate information about the future is impossible. Prediction can be useful to assist in making plans about possible developments.

==Opinion==
In a non-statistical sense, the term &quot;prediction&quot; is often used to refer to an informed guess or opinion.

A prediction of this kind might be informed by a predicting person&#x27;s abductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and experience; and may be useful—if the predicting person is a knowledgeable person in the field.

The Delphi method is a technique for eliciting such expert-judgement-based predictions in a controlled way. This type of prediction might be perceived as consistent with statistical techniques in the sense that, at minimum, the &quot;data&quot; being used is the predicting expert&#x27;s cognitive experiences forming an intuitive &quot;probability curve.&quot;

==Statistics==
In statistics, prediction is a part of statistical inference. One particular approach to such inference is known as predictive inference, but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one possible description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as forecasting. Forecasting usually requires time series methods, while prediction is often performed on cross-sectional data.

Statistical techniques used for prediction include regression and its various sub-categories such as linear regression, generalized linear models (logistic regression, Poisson regression, Probit regression), etc. In case of forecasting, autoregressive moving average models and vector autoregression models can be utilized. When these and/or related, generalized set of regression or machine learning methods are deployed in commercial usage, the field is known as predictive analytics.

In many applications, such as time series analysis, it is possible to estimate the models that generate the observations. If models can be expressed as transfer functions or in terms of state-space parameters then smoothed, filtered and predicted data estimates can be calculated. If the underlying generating models are linear then a minimum-variance Kalman filter and a minimum-variance smoother may be used to recover data of interest from noisy measurements. These techniques rely on one-step-ahead predictors (which minimise the variance of the prediction error). When the generating models are nonlinear then stepwise linearizations may be applied within Extended Kalman Filter and smoother recursions. However, in nonlinear cases, optimum minimum-variance performance guarantees no longer apply.

To use regression analysis for prediction, data are collected on the variable that is to be predicted, called the dependent variable or response variable, and on one or more variables whose values are hypothesized to influence it, called independent variables or explanatory variables. A functional form, often linear, is hypothesized for the postulated causal relationship, and the parameters of the function are estimated from the data—that is, are chosen so as to optimize is some way the fit of the function, thus parameterized, to the data. That is the estimation step. For the prediction step, explanatory variable values that are deemed relevant to future (or current but not yet observed) values of the dependent variable are input to the parameterized function to generate predictions for the dependent variable.

An unbiased performance estimate of a model can be obtained on hold-out test sets. The predictions can visually be compared to the ground truth in a parity plot.

==Science==
In science, a prediction is a rigorous, often quantitative, statement, forecasting what would be observed under specific conditions; for example, according to theories of gravity, if an apple fell from a tree it would be seen to move towards the center of the Earth with a specified and constant acceleration. The scientific method is built on testing statements that are logical consequences of scientific theories. This is done through repeatable experiments or observational studies.

A scientific theory whose predictions are contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected. New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or falsified (see predictive power). Notions that make no &quot;testable&quot; predictions are usually considered not to be part of science (protoscience or nescience) until testable predictions can be made.

Mathematical equations and models, and computer models, are frequently used to describe the past and future behaviour of a process within the boundaries of that model. In some cases the probability of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of quantum physics.

In microprocessors, branch prediction permits avoidance of pipeline emptying at branch instructions.

In engineering, possible failure modes are predicted and avoided by correcting the failure mechanism causing the failure.

Accurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as natural disasters, pandemics, demography, population dynamics and meteorology. For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of solar cycles, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult (see picture to right).

In materials engineering it is also possible to predict the life time of a material with a mathematical model.

In medical science predictive and prognostic biomarkers can be used to predict patient outcomes in response to various treatment or the probability of a clinical event.

=== Hypothesis ===
Established science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, eclipses are routinely predicted.

New theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality. For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge. In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute frame of reference, which was given the name &quot;luminiferous ether&quot;. The existence of this absolute frame was deemed necessary for consistency with the established idea that the speed of light is constant. The famous Michelson–Morley experiment demonstrated that predictions deduced from this concept were not borne out in reality, thus disproving the theory of an absolute frame of reference. The special theory of relativity was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.

Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, as one of the first tests of general relativity, the theory predicted that large masses such as stars would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.

Mathematical models of stock market behaviour (and economic behaviour in general) are also unreliable in predicting future behaviour. Among other reasons, this is because economic events may span several years, and the world is changing over a similar time frame, thus invalidating the relevance of past observations to the present. Thus there are an extremely small number (of the order of 1) of relevant past data points from which to project the future. In addition, it is generally believed that stock market prices already take into account all the information available to predict the future, and subsequent movements must therefore be the result of unforeseen events. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for a stock investor to anticipate or predict a stock market boom, or a stock market crash. In contrast to predicting the actual stock return, forecasting of broad economic trends tends to have better accuracy. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions.

Some correlation has been seen between actual stock market movements and prediction data from large groups in surveys and prediction games.

An actuary uses actuarial science to assess and predict future business risk, such that the risk(s) can be mitigated. For example, in insurance an actuary would use a life table (which incorporates the historical experience of mortality rates and sometimes an estimate of future trends) to project life expectancy.

==Sports==

Predicting the outcome of sporting events is a business which has grown in popularity in recent years. Handicappers predict the outcome of games using a variety of mathematical formulas, simulation models or qualitative analysis. Early, well known sports bettors, such as Jimmy the Greek, were believed to have access to information that gave them an edge. Information ranged from personal issues, such as gambling or drinking to undisclosed injuries; anything that may affect the performance of a player on the field.

Recent times have changed the way sports are predicted. Predictions now typically consist of two distinct approaches: Situational plays and statistical based models. Situational plays are much more difficult to measure because they usually involve the motivation of a team. Dan Gordon, noted handicapper, wrote &quot;Without an emotional edge in a game in addition to value in a line, I won&#x27;t put my money on it&quot;. These types of plays consist of: Betting on the home underdog, betting against Monday Night winners if they are a favorite next week, betting the underdog in &quot;look ahead&quot; games etc. As situational plays become more widely known they become less useful because they will impact the way the line is set.

The widespread use of technology has brought with it more modern sports betting systems. These systems are typically algorithms and simulation models based on regression analysis. Jeff Sagarin, a sports statistician, has brought attention to sports by having the results of his models published in USA Today. He is currently paid as a consultant by the Dallas Mavericks for his advice on lineups and the use of his Winval system, which evaluates free agents. Brian Burke, a former Navy fighter pilot turned sports statistician, has published his results of using regression analysis to predict the outcome of NFL games. Ken Pomeroy is widely accepted as a leading authority on college basketball statistics. His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, a tempo based statistics system. Some statisticians have become very famous for having successful prediction systems. Dare wrote &quot;the effective odds for sports betting and horse racing are a direct result of human decisions and can therefore potentially exhibit consistent error&quot;. Unlike other games offered in a casino, prediction in sporting events can be both logical and consistent.

Other more advance models include those based on Bayesian networks, which are causal probabilistic models commonly used for risk analysis and decision support. Based on this kind of mathematical modelling, Constantinou et al., have developed models for predicting the outcome of association football matches. What makes these models interesting is that, apart from taking into consideration relevant historical data, they also incorporate all these vague subjective factors, like availability of key players, team fatigue, team motivation and so on. They provide the user with the ability to include their best guesses about things that there are no hard facts available. This additional information is then combined with historical facts to provide a revised prediction for future match outcomes. The initial results based on these modelling practices are encouraging since they have demonstrated consistent profitability against published market odds.

Nowadays sport betting is a huge business; there are many websites (systems) alongside betting sites, which give tips or predictions for future games. Some of these prediction websites (tipsters) are based on human predictions, but others on computer software sometimes called prediction robots or bots. Prediction bots can use different amount of data and algorithms and because of that their accuracy may vary.

These days, with the development of artificial intelligence, it has become possible to create more consistent predictions using statistics. Especially in the field of sports competitions, the impact of artificial intelligence has created a noticeable consistency rate. On the science of AI soccer predictions, an initiative called soccerseer.com, one of the most successful systems in this sense, manages to predict the results of football competitions with up to 75% accuracy with artificial intelligence.

==Social science==
Prediction in the non-economic social sciences differs from the natural sciences and includes multiple alternative methods such as trend projection, forecasting, scenario-building and Delphi surveys. The oil company Shell is particularly well known for its scenario-building activities.

One reason for the peculiarity of societal prediction is that in the social sciences, &quot;predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process&quot;. As a consequence, societal predictions can become self-destructing. For example, a forecast that a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more security cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.

In politics it is common to attempt to predict the outcome of elections via political forecasting techniques (or assess the popularity of politicians) through the use of opinion polls. Prediction games have been used by many corporations and governments to learn about the most likely outcome of future events.

==Prophecy==
Predictions have often been made, from antiquity until the present, by using paranormal or supernatural means such as prophecy or by observing omens. Methods including water divining, astrology, numerology, fortune telling, interpretation of dreams, and many other forms of divination, have been used for millennia to attempt to predict the future. These means of prediction have not been proven by scientific experiments.

In literature, vision and prophecy are literary devices used to present a possible timeline of future events. They can be distinguished by vision referring to what an individual sees happen. The book of Revelation, in the New Testament, thus uses vision as a literary device in this regard. It is also prophecy or prophetic literature when it is related by an individual in a sermon or other public forum.

Divination is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic standardized process or ritual. It is an integral part of witchcraft and has been used in various forms for thousands of years. Diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency, most often described as an angel or a god though viewed by Christians and Jews as a fallen angel or demon.

==Fiction==
Fiction (especially fantasy, forecasting and science fiction) often features instances of prediction achieved by unconventional means. Science fiction of the past predicted various modern technologies.

In fantasy literature, predictions are often obtained through magic or prophecy, sometimes referring back to old traditions. For example, in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, many of the characters possess an awareness of events extending into the future, sometimes as prophecies, sometimes as more-or-less vague &#x27;feelings&#x27;. The character Galadriel, in addition, employs a water &quot;mirror&quot; to show images, sometimes of possible future events.

In some of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s stories, mutant humans called &quot;precogs&quot; can foresee the future (ranging from days to years). In the story called &quot;The Golden Man&quot;, an exceptional mutant can predict the future to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. Precogs also play an essential role in another of Dick&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Minority Report&quot;, which was turned into a film by Steven Spielberg in 2002.

In the &quot;Foundation&quot; series by Isaac Asimov, a mathematician finds out that historical events (up to some detail) can be theoretically modelled using equations, and then spends years trying to put the theory in practice. The new science of psychohistory founded upon his success can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.

In Frank Herbert&#x27;s sequels to 1965&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, his characters are dealing with the repercussions of being able to see the possible futures and select amongst them. Herbert sees this as a trap of stagnation, and his characters follow a so-called &quot;Golden Path&quot; out of the trap.

In Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, the humanoid inhabitants of planet Gethen have mastered the art of prophecy and routinely produce data on past, present or future events on request. In this story, this was a minor plot device.

== Poetry ==
For the ancients, prediction, prophesy, and poetry were often intertwined. Prophecies were given in verse, and a word for poet in Latin is “vates” or prophet. Both poets and prophets claimed to be inspired by forces outside themselves. In contemporary cultures, theological revelation and poetry are typically seen as distinct and often even as opposed to each other. Yet the two still are often understood together as symbiotic in their origins, aims, and purposes.

<text>Predictability is the degree to which a correct prediction or forecast of a system&#x27;s state can be made, either qualitatively or quantitatively.

==Predictability and causality==

Causal determinism has a strong relationship with predictability. Perfect predictability implies strict determinism, but lack of predictability does not necessarily imply lack of determinism. Limitations on predictability could be caused by factors such as a lack of information or excessive complexity. 
In experimental physics, there are always observational errors determining variables such as positions and velocities. So perfect prediction is &quot;practically&quot; impossible. Moreover, in modern quantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s indeterminacy principle puts limits on the accuracy with which such quantities can be known. So such perfect predictability is also &quot;theoretically&quot; impossible. 

=== Laplace&#x27;s demon ===
Laplace&#x27;s demon is a supreme intelligence who could completely predict the one possible future given the Newtonian dynamical laws of classical physics and perfect knowledge of the positions and velocities of all the particles in the world. In other words, if it were possible to have every piece of data on every atom in the universe from the beginning of time, it would be possible to predict the behavior of every atom into the future. Laplace&#x27;s determinism is usually thought to be based on his mechanics, but he could not prove mathematically that mechanics is deterministic. Rather, his determinism is based on general philosophical principles, specifically on the principle of sufficient reason and the law of continuity.

==In statistical physics==
Although the second law of thermodynamics can determine the equilibrium state that a system will evolve to, and steady states in dissipative systems can sometimes be predicted, there exists no general rule to predict the time evolution of systems distanced from equilibrium, e.g. chaotic systems, if they do not approach an equilibrium state. Their predictability usually deteriorates with time and to quantify predictability, the rate of divergence of system trajectories in phase space can be measured (Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy, Lyapunov exponents).

==In mathematics==
In stochastic analysis a random process is a predictable process if it is possible to know the next state from the present time.

The branch of mathematics known as Chaos Theory focuses on the behavior of systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. It suggests that a small change in an initial condition can completely alter the progression of a system. This phenomenon is known as the butterfly effect, which claims that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas. The nature of chaos theory suggests that the predictability of any system is limited because it is impossible to know all of the minutiae of a system at the present time. In principle, the deterministic systems that chaos theory attempts to analyze can be predicted, but uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time.

As documented in, three major kinds of butterfly effects within Lorenz studies include: the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, the ability of a tiny perturbation to create an organized circulation at large distances, and the hypothetical role of small-scale processes in contributing to finite predictability. The three kinds of butterfly effects are not exactly the same. 
== In human–computer interaction ==
In the study of human–computer interaction, predictability is the property to forecast the consequences of a user action given the current state of the system.

A contemporary example of human-computer interaction manifests in the development of computer vision algorithms for collision-avoidance software in self-driving cars. Researchers at NVIDIA Corporation, Princeton University, and other institutions are leveraging deep learning to teach computers to anticipate subsequent road scenarios based on visual information about current and previous states.

Another example of human-computer interaction are computer simulations meant to predict human behavior based on algorithms. For example, MIT has recently developed an incredibly accurate algorithm to predict the behavior of humans. When tested against television shows, the algorithm was able to predict with great accuracy the subsequent actions of characters. Algorithms and computer simulations like these show great promise for the future of artificial intelligence.

==In human sentence processing==

Linguistic prediction is a phenomenon in psycholinguistics occurring whenever information about a word or other linguistic unit is activated before that unit is actually encountered. Evidence from eyetracking, event-related potentials, and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words, language users may, under certain conditions, try to predict upcoming words. Predictability has been shown to affect both text and speech processing, as well as speech production. Further, predictability has been shown to have an effect on syntactic, semantic and pragmatic comprehension.

==In biology==
In the study of biology – particularly genetics and neuroscience – predictability relates to the prediction of biological developments and behaviors based on inherited genes and past experiences.

Significant debate exists in the scientific community over whether or not a person&#x27;s behavior is completely predictable based on their genetics. Studies such as the one in Israel, which showed that judges were more likely to give a lighter sentence if they had eaten more recently. In addition to cases like this, it has been proven that individuals smell better to someone with complementary immunity genes, leading to more physical attraction. Genetics can be examined to determine if an individual is predisposed to any diseases, and behavioral disorders can most often be explained by analyzing defects in genetic code. Scientist who focus on examples like these argue that human behavior is entirely predictable. Those on the other side of the debate argue that genetics can only provide a predisposition to act a certain way and that, ultimately, humans possess the free will to choose whether or not to act.

Animals have significantly more predictable behavior than humans. Driven by natural selection, animals develop mating calls, predator warnings, and communicative dances. One example of these engrained behaviors is the Belding&#x27;s ground squirrel, which developed a specific set of calls that warn nearby squirrels about predators. If a ground squirrel sees a predator on land it will elicit a trill after it gets to safety, which signals to nearby squirrels that they should stand up on their hind legs and attempt to locate the predator. When a predator is seen in the air, a ground squirrel will immediately call out a long whistle, putting himself in danger but signaling for nearby squirrels to run for cover. Through experimentation and examination scientists have been able to chart behaviors like this and very accurately predict how animals behave in certain situations.

== In popular culture ==
The study of predictability often sparks debate between those who believe humans maintain complete control over their free-will and those who believe our actions are predetermined. However, it is likely that neither Newton nor Laplace saw the study of predictability as relating to determinism.

==In weather and climate==

As climate change and other weather phenomenon become more common, the predictability of climate systems becomes more important. The IPCC notes that our ability to predict future detailed climate interactions is difficult, however, long term climate forecasts are possible.

=== The dual nature with distinct predictability ===
Over 50 years since Lorenz&#x27;s 1963 study and a follow-up presentation in 1972, the statement “weather is chaotic” has been well accepted. Such a view turns our attention from regularity associated with Laplace&#x27;s view of determinism to irregularity associated with chaos. In contrast to single-type chaotic solutions, recent studies using a generalized Lorenz model have focused on the coexistence of chaotic and regular solutions that appear within the same model using the same modeling configurations but different initial conditions. The results, with attractor coexistence, suggest that the entirety of weather possesses a dual nature of chaos and order with distinct predictability.

Using a slowly varying, periodic heating parameter within a generalized Lorenz model, Shen and his co-authors suggested a revised view: “The atmosphere possesses chaos and order; it includes, as examples, emerging organized systems (such as tornadoes) and time varying forcing from recurrent seasons”.

===Spring predictability barrier===
The spring predictability barrier refers to a period of time early in the year when making summer weather predictions about the El Niño–Southern Oscillation is difficult. It is unknown why it is difficult, although many theories have been proposed. There is some thought that the cause is due to the ENSO transition where conditions are more rapidly shifting.

== In macroeconomics ==
Predictability in macroeconomics refers most frequently to the degree to which an economic model accurately reflects quarterly data and the degree to which one might successfully identify the internal propagation mechanisms of models. Examples of US macroeconomic series of interest include but are not limited to Consumption, Investment, Real GNP, and Capital Stock. Factors that are involved in the predictability of an economic system include the range of the forecast (is the forecast two years &quot;out&quot; or twenty) and the variability of estimates. Mathematical processes for assessing the predictability of macroeconomic trends are still in development.

<doc id="246074" wikidata="Q7216332" url="?curid=246074" title="Forecasting">
<text>Forecasting is the process of making predictions based on past and present data. Later these can be compared with what actually happens. For example, a company might estimate their revenue in the next year, then compare it against the actual results creating a variance actual analysis. Prediction is a similar but more general term. Forecasting might refer to specific formal statistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or longitudinal data, or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods or the process of prediction and assessment of its accuracy. Usage can vary between areas of application: for example, in hydrology the terms &quot;forecast&quot; and &quot;forecasting&quot; are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times, while the term &quot;prediction&quot; is used for more general estimates, such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period.

Risk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally considered a good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to forecasts. In any case, the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to be as accurate as possible. In some cases the data used to predict the variable of interest is itself forecast. A forecast is not to be confused with a Budget; budgets are more specific, fixed-term financial plans used for resource allocation and control, while forecasts provide estimates of future financial performance, allowing for flexibility and adaptability to changing circumstances. Both tools are valuable in financial planning and decision-making, but they serve different functions.

== Applications ==
Forecasting has applications in a wide range of fields where estimates of future conditions are useful. Depending on the field, accuracy varies significantly. If the factors that relate to what is being forecast are known and well understood and there is a significant amount of data that can be used, it is likely the final value will be close to the forecast. If this is not the case or if the actual outcome is affected by the forecasts, the reliability of the forecasts can be significantly lower.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.otexts.org/fpp/1/1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Climate change and increasing energy prices have led to the use of Egain Forecasting for buildings. This attempts to reduce the energy needed to heat the building, thus reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Forecasting is used in customer demand planning in everyday business for manufacturing and distribution companies.

While the veracity of predictions for actual stock returns are disputed through reference to the efficient-market hypothesis, forecasting of broad economic trends is common. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions.

Forecasting foreign exchange movements is typically achieved through a combination of historical and current data (summarized in charts) and fundamental analysis. An essential difference between chart analysis and fundamental economic analysis is that chartists study only the price action of a market, whereas fundamentalists attempt to look to the reasons behind the action. Financial institutions assimilate the evidence provided by their fundamental and chartist researchers into one note to provide a final projection on the currency in question.

Forecasting has also been used to predict the development of conflict situations. Forecasters perform research that uses empirical results to gauge the effectiveness of certain forecasting models. However research has shown that there is little difference between the accuracy of the forecasts of experts knowledgeable in the conflict situation and those by individuals who knew much less. Similarly, experts in some studies argue that role thinking — standing in other people&#x27;s shoes to forecast their decisions — does not contribute to the accuracy of the forecast. 

An important, albeit often ignored aspect of forecasting, is the relationship it holds with planning. Forecasting can be described as predicting what the future &quot;will&quot; look like, whereas planning predicts what the future &quot;should&quot; look like. There is no single right forecasting method to use. Selection of a method should be based on your objectives and your conditions (data etc.). A good way to find a method is by visiting a selection tree. An example of a selection tree can be found here.

Forecasting has application in many situations:
*Supply chain management and customer demand planning — Forecasting can be used in supply chain management to ensure that the right product is at the right place at the right time. Accurate forecasting will help retailers reduce excess inventory and thus increase profit margin. Accurate forecasting will also help them meet consumer demand. The discipline of demand planning, also sometimes referred to as supply chain forecasting, embraces both statistical forecasting and a consensus process. Studies have shown that extrapolations are the least accurate, while company earnings forecasts are the most reliable.

== Forecasting as training, betting and futarchy ==
In several cases, the forecast is either more or less than a prediction of the future.

In Philip E. Tetlock&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, he discusses forecasting as a method of improving the ability to make decisions. A person can become better calibrated — &quot;i.e.&quot; having things they give 10% credence to happening 10% of the time. Or they can forecast things more confidently — coming to the same conclusion but earlier. Some have claimed that forecasting is a transferable skill with benefits to other areas of discussion and decision making. 

Betting on sports or politics is another form of forecasting. Rather than being used as advice, bettors are paid based on if they predicted correctly. While decisions might be made based on these bets (forecasts), the main motivation is generally financial.

Finally, futarchy is a form of government where forecasts of the impact of government action are used to decide which actions are taken. Rather than advice, in futarchy&#x27;s strongest form, the action with the best forecasted result is automatically taken.

==Forecast improvements==
Forecast improvement projects have been operated in a number of sectors: the National Hurricane Center&#x27;s Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) and the Wind Forecast Improvement Project sponsored by the US Department of Energy are examples. In relation to supply chain management, the Du Pont model has been used to show that an increase in forecast accuracy can generate increases in sales and reductions in inventory, operating expenses and commitment of working capital. The Groceries Code Adjudicator in the United Kingdom, which regulates supply chain management practices in the groceries retail industry, has observed that all the retailers who fall within the scope of his regulation &quot;are striving for continuous improvement in forecasting practice and activity in relation to promotions&quot;.

==Categories of forecasting methods==

===Qualitative vs. quantitative methods===

Qualitative forecasting techniques are subjective, based on the opinion and judgment of consumers and experts; they are appropriate when past data are not available.
They are usually applied to intermediate- or long-range decisions. Examples of qualitative forecasting methods are informed opinion and judgment, the Delphi method, market research, and historical life-cycle analogy.

Quantitative forecasting models are used to forecast future data as a function of past data. They are appropriate to use when past numerical data is available and when it is reasonable to assume that some of the patterns in the data are expected to continue into the future.
These methods are usually applied to short- or intermediate-range decisions. Examples of quantitative forecasting methods are last period demand, simple and weighted N-Period moving averages, simple exponential smoothing, Poisson process model based forecasting and multiplicative seasonal indexes. Previous research shows that different methods may lead to different level of forecasting accuracy. For example, GMDH neural network was found to have better forecasting performance than the classical forecasting algorithms such as Single Exponential Smooth, Double Exponential Smooth, ARIMA and back-propagation neural network.

===Average approach===

In this approach, the predictions of all future values are equal to the mean of the past data. This approach can be used with any sort of data where past data is available. In time series notation:

:formula_1 

where formula_2 is the past data.

Although the time series notation has been used here, the average approach can also be used for cross-sectional data (when we are predicting unobserved values; values that are not included in the data set). Then, the prediction for unobserved values is the average of the observed values.

===Naïve approach===

Naïve forecasts are the most cost-effective forecasting model, and provide a benchmark against which more sophisticated models can be compared. This forecasting method is only suitable for time series data. Using the naïve approach, forecasts are produced that are equal to the last observed value. This method works quite well for economic and financial time series, which often have patterns that are difficult to reliably and accurately predict. If the time series is believed to have seasonality, the seasonal naïve approach may be more appropriate where the forecasts are equal to the value from last season. In time series notation:

:formula_3

===Drift method===
A variation on the naïve method is to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time, where the amount of change over time (called the drift) is set to be the average change seen in the historical data. So the forecast for time formula_4 is given by

:formula_5 

This is equivalent to drawing a line between the first and last observation, and extrapolating it into the future.

===Seasonal naïve approach===

The seasonal naïve method accounts for seasonality by setting each prediction to be equal to the last observed value of the same season. For example, the prediction value for all subsequent months of April will be equal to the previous value observed for April. The forecast for time formula_6 is

:formula_7
where formula_8=seasonal period and formula_9 is the smallest integer greater than formula_10.

The seasonal naïve method is particularly useful for data that has a very high level of seasonality.

=== Deterministic approach ===
A deterministic approach is when there is no stochastic variable involved and the forecasts depend on the selected functions and parameters. For example, given the function 

:formula_11
The short term behaviour formula_12 and the is the medium-long term trend formula_13 are 
:formula_14

where formula_15 are some parameters.

This approach has been proposed to simulate bursts of seemingly stochastic activity, interrupted by quieter periods. The assumption is that the presence of a strong deterministic ingredient is hidden by noise. The deterministic approach is noteworthy as it can reveal the underlying dynamical systems structure, which can be exploited for steering the dynamics into a desired regime.

===Time series methods===
Time series methods use historical data as the basis of estimating future outcomes. They are based on the assumption that past demand history is a good indicator of future demand.

*Moving average
*Weighted moving average
*Exponential smoothing
*Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) (forecasts depend on past values of the variable being forecast and on past prediction errors)
*Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (ARMA on the period-to-period change in the forecast variable)
:e.g. Box–Jenkins 
:Seasonal ARIMA or SARIMA or ARIMARCH,
*Extrapolation
*Linear prediction
*Trend estimation (predicting the variable as a linear or polynomial function of time)
*Growth curve (statistics)
*Recurrent neural network

===Relational methods===

Some forecasting methods try to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast. For example, including information about climate patterns might improve the ability of a model to predict umbrella sales. Forecasting models often take account of regular seasonal variations. In addition to climate, such variations can also be due to holidays and customs: for example, one might predict that sales of college football apparel will be higher during the football season than during the off season.

Several informal methods used in causal forecasting do not rely solely on the output of mathematical algorithms, but instead use the judgment of the forecaster. Some forecasts take account of past relationships between variables: if one variable has, for example, been approximately linearly related to another for a long period of time, it may be appropriate to extrapolate such a relationship into the future, without necessarily understanding the reasons for the relationship.

Causal methods include:

*Regression analysis includes a large group of methods for predicting future values of a variable using information about other variables. These methods include both parametric (linear or non-linear) and non-parametric techniques.
*Autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX)

Quantitative forecasting models are often judged against each other by comparing their in-sample or out-of-sample mean square error, although some researchers have advised against this. Different forecasting approaches have different levels of accuracy. For example, it was found in one context that GMDH has higher forecasting accuracy than traditional ARIMA.

===Judgmental methods===

Judgmental forecasting methods incorporate intuitive judgement, opinions and subjective probability estimates. Judgmental forecasting is used in cases where there is a lack of historical data or during completely new and unique market conditions.

Judgmental methods include:

*Composite forecasts
*Cooke&#x27;s method
*Delphi method
*Forecast by analogy
*Scenario building
*Statistical surveys
*Technology forecasting

===Artificial intelligence methods===
*Artificial neural networks
*Group method of data handling
*Support vector machines

Often these are done today by specialized programs loosely labeled
*Data mining
*Machine learning
*Pattern recognition

===Geometric extrapolation with error prediction===

Can be created with 3 points of a sequence and the &quot;moment&quot; or &quot;index&quot;. This type of extrapolation has 100% accuracy in predictions in a big percentage of known series database (OEIS).

===Other methods===
*Granger causality
*Simulation
*Demand forecasting
*Probabilistic forecasting and Ensemble forecasting

==Forecasting accuracy==

The forecast error (also known as a residual) is the difference between the actual value and the forecast value for the corresponding period:

:formula_16

where E is the forecast error at period t, Y is the actual value at period t, and F is the forecast for period t.

A good forecasting method will yield residuals that are uncorrelated. If there are correlations between residual values, then there is information left in the residuals which should be used in computing forecasts. This can be accomplished by computing the expected value of a residual as a function of the known past residuals, and adjusting the forecast by the amount by which this expected value differs from zero.

A good forecasting method will also have zero mean. If the residuals have a mean other than zero, then the forecasts are biased and can be improved by adjusting the forecasting technique by an additive constant that equals the mean of the unadjusted residuals.

Measures of aggregate error:

===Scaled-dependent errors===
The forecast error, E, is on the same scale as the data, as such, these accuracy measures are scale-dependent and cannot be used to make comparisons between series on different scales.

Mean absolute error (MAE) or mean absolute deviation (MAD): formula_17

Mean squared error (MSE) or mean squared prediction error (MSPE): formula_18

Root mean squared error (RMSE): formula_19

Average of Errors (E): formula_20

===Percentage errors===
These are more frequently used to compare forecast performance between different data sets because they are scale-independent. However, they have the disadvantage of being extremely large or undefined if Y is close to or equal to zero.

Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE): formula_21

Mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD): formula_22

===Scaled errors===
Hyndman and Koehler (2006) proposed using scaled errors as an alternative to percentage errors.

Mean absolute scaled error (MASE): formula_23

where &quot;m&quot;=seasonal period or 1 if non-seasonal

===Other measures===
Forecast skill (SS): formula_24

Business forecasters and practitioners sometimes use different terminology. They refer to the PMAD as the MAPE, although they compute this as a volume weighted MAPE. For more information, see Calculating demand forecast accuracy.

When comparing the accuracy of different forecasting methods on a specific data set, the measures of aggregate error are compared with each other and the method that yields the lowest error is preferred.

===Training and test sets===

When evaluating the quality of forecasts, it is invalid to look at how well a model fits the historical data; the accuracy of forecasts can only be determined by considering how well a model performs on new data that were not used when fitting the model. When choosing models, it is common to use a portion of the available data for fitting, and use the rest of the data for testing the model, as was done in the above examples.

===Cross-validation===

Cross-validation is a more sophisticated version of training a test set.

For cross-sectional data, one approach to cross-validation works as follows:
# Select observation &quot;i&quot; for the test set, and use the remaining observations in the training set. Compute the error on the test observation.
# Repeat the above step for &quot;i&quot; = 1,2..., &quot;N&quot; where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of observations.
# Compute the forecast accuracy measures based on the errors obtained.
This makes efficient use of the available data, as only one observation is omitted at each step

For time series data, the training set can only include observations prior to the test set. Therefore, no future observations can be used in constructing the forecast. Suppose &quot;k&quot; observations are needed to produce a reliable forecast; then the process works as follows:
# Starting with &quot;i&quot;=1, select the observation &quot;k + i&quot; for the test set, and use the observations at times 1, 2, ..., &quot;k+i&quot;–1 to estimate the forecasting model. Compute the error on the forecast for &quot;k+i&quot;.
# Repeat the above step for &quot;i&quot; = 2...,&quot;T–k&quot; where &quot;T&quot; is the total number of observations.
# Compute the forecast accuracy over all errors.
This procedure is sometimes known as a &quot;rolling forecasting origin&quot; because the &quot;origin&quot; (&quot;k+i -1)&quot; at which the forecast is based rolls forward in time. Further, two-step-ahead or in general &quot;p&quot;-step-ahead forecasts can be computed by first forecasting the value immediately after the training set, then using this value with the training set values to forecast two periods ahead, etc.

==Seasonality and cyclic behaviour==

===Seasonality===

Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year. Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one-year period can be said to be seasonal. It is common in many situations – such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner&#x27;s office—that the demand depends on the day of the week. In such situations, the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the &quot;season&quot; – seven seasons, one for each day – which is the ratio of the average demand of that season (which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season) to the average demand across all seasons. An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average.

===Cyclic behaviour===

The cyclic behaviour of data takes place when there are regular fluctuations in the data which usually last for an interval of at least two years, and when the length of the current cycle cannot be predetermined. Cyclic behavior is not to be confused with seasonal behavior. Seasonal fluctuations follow a consistent pattern each year so the period is always known. As an example, during the Christmas period, inventories of stores tend to increase in order to prepare for Christmas shoppers. As an example of cyclic behaviour, the population of a particular natural ecosystem will exhibit cyclic behaviour when the population decreases as its natural food source decreases, and once the population is low, the food source will recover and the population will start to increase again. Cyclic data cannot be accounted for using ordinary seasonal adjustment since it is not of fixed period.

==Limitations==

Limitations pose barriers beyond which forecasting methods cannot reliably predict. There are many events and values that cannot be forecast reliably. Events such as the roll of a die or the results of the lottery cannot be forecast because they are random events and there is no significant relationship in the data. When the factors that lead to what is being forecast are not known or well understood such as in stock and foreign exchange markets forecasts are often inaccurate or wrong as there is not enough data about everything that affects these markets for the forecasts to be reliable, in addition the outcomes of the forecasts of these markets change the behavior of those involved in the market further reducing forecast accuracy.

The concept of &quot;self-destructing predictions&quot; concerns the way in which some predictions can undermine themselves by influencing social behavior. This is because &quot;predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process&quot;. For example, a forecast that a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more security cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.

===Performance limits of fluid dynamics equations===
As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range weather forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. Extremely small errors in the initial input, such as temperatures and winds, within numerical models double every five days.

<text>A credit union is a member-owned nonprofit cooperative financial institution. They may offer financial services equivalent to those of commercial banks, such as share accounts (savings accounts), share draft accounts (cheque accounts), credit cards, credit, share term certificates (certificates of deposit), and online banking. Normally, only a member of a credit union may deposit or borrow money. In several African countries, credit unions are commonly referred to as &quot;SACCOs&quot; (&quot;savings and credit co-operatives&quot;).

Worldwide, credit union systems vary significantly in their total assets and average institution asset size, ranging from volunteer operations with a handful of members to institutions with hundreds of thousands of members and assets worth billions of US dollars. In 2018, the number of members in credit unions worldwide was 375 million, with over 100 million members having been added since 2016.

Leading up to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, in 2006, 23.6% of mortgages from commercial banks were &quot;subprime&quot;, compared to only 3.6% of those from credit unions, and banks were two and a half times more likely to fail during the crisis. American credit unions more than doubled lending to small businesses between 2008 and 2016, from $30 billion to $60 billion, while lending to small businesses overall during the same period declined by around $100 billion. In the US, public trust in credit unions stands at 60%, compared to 30% for big banks. Furthermore, small businesses are 80% more likely to be satisfied by a credit union than with a big bank.

&quot;Natural-person credit unions&quot; (also called &quot;retail credit unions&quot; or &quot;consumer credit unions&quot;) serve individuals, as distinguished from &quot;corporate credit unions&quot;, which serve other credit unions.

== Differences from other financial institutions ==
Credit unions differ from banks and other financial institutions in that those who have accounts in the credit union are its members and owners, and they elect their board of directors in a one-person-one-vote system, regardless of the amount they might have invested. Credit unions see themselves as different from mainstream banks, with a mission to be community-oriented and to &quot;serve people, not profit&quot;.

Surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown significantly higher customer satisfaction rates with the quality of service at credit unions. Credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of financial inclusion, credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most microfinance institutions.

Credit unions differ from modern microfinance. Particularly, members&#x27; control over financial resources is the distinguishing feature between the cooperative model and modern microfinance. The current dominant model of microfinance, whether it is provided by not-for-profit or for-profit institutions, places the control over financial resources and their allocation in the hands of a small number of microfinance providers that benefit from the highly profitable sector.

== Not-for-profit status ==
In the credit union context, &quot;not-for-profit&quot; must be distinguished from a charity. Credit unions are &quot;not-for-profit&quot; because their purpose is to serve their members rather than to maximize profits, so unlike charities, credit unions do not rely on donations and are financial institutions that must make what is, in economic terms, a small profit (i.e., in non-profit accounting terms, a &quot;surplus&quot;) to remain in existence. According to the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), a credit union&#x27;s revenues (from loans and investments) must exceed its operating expenses and dividends (interest paid on deposits) in order to maintain capital and solvency.

In the United States, credit unions incorporated and operating under a state credit union law are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(14)(A). Federal credit unions organized and operated in accordance with the Federal Credit Union Act are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(1).

== Global presence ==
According to the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), at the end of 2018 there were 85,400 credit unions in 118 countries. Collectively they served 274.2 million members and oversaw US$2.19 trillion in assets. WOCCU does not include data from cooperative banks, so, for example, some countries generally seen as the pioneers of credit unionism, such as Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy, are not always included in their data. The European Association of Co-operative Banks reported 38 million members in those four countries at the end of 2010.

The countries with the most credit union activity are highly diverse. According to WOCCU, the countries with the greatest number of credit union members were the United States (101 million), India (20 million), Canada (10 million), Brazil (6.0 million), South Korea (5.7 million), Philippines (5.4 million), Kenya and Mexico (5.1 million each), Ecuador (4.8 million), Australia (4.5 million), Thailand (4.1 million), Colombia (3.6 million), and Ireland (3.3 million).

The countries with the highest percentage of credit union members in the economically active population were Barbados (82%), Ireland (75%), Grenada (72%), Trinidad &amp; Tobago (68%), Belize and St. Lucia (67% each), St. Kitts &amp; Nevis (58%), Jamaica (53% each), Antigua and Barbuda (49%), the United States (48%), Ecuador (47%), and Canada (43%). Several African and Latin American countries also had high credit union membership rates, as did Australia and South Korea. The average percentage for all countries considered in the report was 8.2%. Credit unions were launched in Poland in 1992; there were 2,000 credit union branches there with 2.2 million members. From 1996 to 2016, credit unions in Costa Rica almost tripled their share of the financial market (they grew from 3.7% of the market share to 9.9%), and grew faster than private-sector banks or state-owned banks in Costa Rica, after financial reforms in that country.

== History ==


&quot;Spolok Gazdovský&quot; (&quot;The Association of Administrators&quot; or &quot;The Association of Farmers&quot;), founded in 1845 by Samuel Jurkovič, was the first cooperative financial institution in Europe. The cooperative provided a cheap loan from funds generated by regular savings for members of the cooperative. Members of the cooperative had to commit to a moral life and had to plant two trees in a public place every year. Despite the short duration of its existence, until 1851, it thus formed the basis of the cooperative movement in Slovakia. Slovak national thinker Ľudovít Štúr said about the association: &quot;We would very much like such excellent constitutions to be established throughout our region. They would help to rescue people from evil and misery. A beautiful, great idea, a beautiful excellent constitution!&quot;

Modern credit union history dates from 1852, when Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch consolidated the learning from two pilot projects, one in Eilenburg and the other in Delitzsch in the Kingdom of Saxony into what are generally recognized as the first credit unions in the world. He went on to develop a highly successful urban credit union system. In 1864, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first rural credit union in Heddesdorf (now part of Neuwied) in Germany. By the time of Raiffeisen&#x27;s death in 1888, credit unions had spread to Italy, France, the Netherlands, England, Austria, and other nations.

The first credit union in North America, the Caisse Populaire de Lévis in Quebec, Canada, began operations on 23 January 1901 with a 10-cent deposit. Founder Alphonse Desjardins, a reporter in the Canadian parliament, was moved to take up his mission in 1897 when he learned of a Montrealer who had been ordered by the court to pay nearly Can$5,000 in interest on a loan of $150 from a moneylender. Drawing extensively on European precedents, Desjardins developed a unique parish-based model for Quebec: the &quot;caisse populaire&quot;.

In the United States, St. Mary&#x27;s Bank Credit Union of Manchester, New Hampshire, was the first credit union. Assisted by a personal visit from Desjardins, St. Mary&#x27;s was founded by French-speaking immigrants to Manchester from Quebec on 24 November 1908. Several Little Canadas throughout New England formed similar credit unions, often out of necessity, as Anglo-American banks frequently rejected Franco-American loans. America&#x27;s Credit Union Museum now occupies the location of the home from which St. Mary&#x27;s Bank Credit Union first operated. In November 1910 the Woman&#x27;s Educational and Industrial Union set up the Industrial Credit Union, modeled on the Desjardins credit unions it was the first non-faith-based community credit union serving all people in the greater Boston area. The oldest statewide credit union in the United States was established in 1913. The St. Mary&#x27;s Bank Credit Union serves any resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

After being promoted by the Catholic Church in the 1940s to assist the poor in Latin America, credit unions expanded rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s, especially in Bolivia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Peru. The Regional Confederation of Latin American Credit Unions (COLAC) was formed and with funding by the Inter-American Development Bank credit unions in the regions grew rapidly throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s. By 1988 COLAC credit unions represented four million members across 17 countries with a loan portfolio of circa US$0.5 billion. However, from the late 1970s onwards many Latin American credit unions struggled with inflation, stagnating membership, and serious loan recovery problems. In the 1980s donor agencies such as USAID attempted to rehabilitate Latin American credit unions by providing technical assistance and focusing credit unions&#x27; efforts on mobilising deposits from the local population. In 1987, the regional financial crisis caused a run on credit unions. Significant withdrawals and high default rates caused liquidity problems for many credit unions in the region.

==Stability and risks==
Credit unions and banks in most jurisdictions are legally required to maintain a reserve requirement of assets to liabilities. If a credit union or traditional bank is unable to maintain positive cash flow and/or is forced to declare insolvency, its assets are distributed to creditors (including depositors) in order of seniority according to bankruptcy law. If the total deposits exceed the assets remaining after more senior creditors are paid, all depositors will lose some or all of their initial deposits. However, many jurisdictions have deposit insurance that promises to reimburse members for funds lost up to a certain threshold, such as the National Credit Union Administration’s Share Insurance Fund or the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.

== Corporate ==
Credit unions as such provide service only to individual consumers. &quot;Corporate credit unions&quot; (also known as &quot;central credit unions&quot; in Canada) provide service to credit unions, with operational support, funds clearing tasks, and product and service delivery.

== Leagues and associations ==
Credit unions often form cooperatives among themselves to provide services to members. A credit union service organization (CUSO) is generally a for-profit subsidiary of one or more credit unions formed for this purpose. For example, CO-OP Financial Services, the largest credit-union-owned interbank network in the United States, provides an ATM network and shared branching services to credit unions. Other examples of cooperatives among credit unions include credit counselling services as well as insurance and investment services.

State credit union leagues can partner with outside organizations to promote initiatives for credit unions or customers. For example, the Indiana Credit Union League sponsors an initiative called &quot;Ignite&quot;, which is used to encourage innovation in the credit union industry, with the Filene Research Institute.

The Credit Union National Association (CUNA) is a national trade association for both state- and federally chartered credit unions located in the United States. The National Credit Union Foundation is the primary charitable arm of the United States&#x27; credit union movement and an affiliate of CUNA.

The National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU) is a national trade association for all state and federally-chartered credit unions. Based outside of Washington, D.C., NAFCU&#x27;s mission is to provide all credit unions with federal advocacy, compliance assistance, and education.

The World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) is both a trade association for credit unions worldwide and a development agency. The WOCCU&#x27;s mission is to &quot;assist its members and potential members to organize, expand, improve and integrate credit unions and related institutions as effective instruments for the economic and social development of all people&quot;.

EverythingCU.com is an online community of credit union professionals.

== Deposit insurance ==
In the United States, federal credit unions are chartered and overseen by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which also provides deposit insurance similar to the manner in which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance to banks. State-chartered credit unions are overseen by the state&#x27;s financial regulatory agency and may, but are not required to, obtain deposit insurance. Because of problems with bank failures in the past, no state provides deposit insurance and as such there are two primary sources for depository insurance – the NCUA and American Share Insurance (ASI), a private insurer based in Ohio.

In Canada, the majority of credit unions and &quot;caisses populaires&quot; are provincially incorporated and deposit insurance is provided by a provincial Crown corporation. For example, in Ontario up to 250,000 of eligible deposits in credit unions are insured by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario. Federal credit unions, such as the UNI Financial Cooperation &quot;caisse&quot; in New Brunswick, are incorporated under federal charters and are members of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.

<doc id="246089" wikidata="Q191375" url="?curid=246089" title="Sheikh Mujibur Rahman">
<text>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), also known by the honorific Bangabandhu, was a Bangladeshi politician, revolutionary, statesman and activist, who was the founding president of Bangladesh. As one of the founding leaders of Bangladesh, he has held several political offices; since 1966 during the Pakistani colonial era in East Bengal, he had served as the president of a Bengali nationalist party, Awami League, which led the Bengali region of East Pakistan to secede from Pakistan through a nine month long war to form the independent People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh in 1971. He declared the independence of Bangladesh, and was declared as the first president of Bangladesh in the midst of the independence war albeit being imprisoned by the Pakistani government at that time. After Bangladesh&#x27;s victory in the war and his subsequent release from Pakistani imprisonment in January 1972, Mujib returned to Bangladesh and resigned from his first presidential term in order to take over as the second prime minister of the new country, under which capacity he served for over three years. Following his resignation from Bangladesh&#x27;s premiership, he took over Bangladesh&#x27;s presidency again as the fourth president of the country, during which time he abolished all other political parties except for his own party, the Bangladesh Awami League, which was merged with three other political parties to form the new Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BaKSAL) in order to bring Bangladesh under a one-party-system that effectively allowed him to become president for life under which role he served for less than seven months until his assassination in a coup d&#x27;état conducted by some officers of the Bangladesh Army in August 1975. His nationalist ideology, socio-political theories, and political doctrines are collectively known as Mujibism.

Born in an aristocratic Muslim family in Tungipara, Mujib emerged as a student activist in the province of Bengal during the final years of the British Raj. He was a member of the All India Muslim League. He supported Muslim nationalism and advocated for the establishment of Pakistan in his early political career. In 1949, he was part of a liberal, secular and left-wing faction which later became the Awami League. In the 1950s, he was elected to Pakistan&#x27;s parliament where he defended the rights of East Bengal. Mujib served 13 years in prison during the British Raj and Pakistani rule.

By the 1960s, Mujib adopted Bengali nationalism and soon became the undisputed leader of East Pakistan. He became popular for opposing West Pakistan&#x27;s political, ethnic and institutional discrimination against the Bengalis of East Pakistan; leading the six-point autonomy movement, he challenged the regime of Pakistan&#x27;s President Ayub Khan. In 1970, he led the Awami League to win Pakistan&#x27;s first general election. When the Pakistani military junta refused to transfer power, he gave the 7th March speech in 1971 where he vaguely called out for the independence of East Bengal (East Pakistan). In the late hours of 25 March 1971, the Pakistan Army arrested Sheikh Mujib on charges of treason and carried out an infamous genocide against the Bengali civilians of East Pakistan. In the early hours of the next day (26 March 1971), a Bengali army major by the name of Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh through the secession of East Pakistan from its western wing, which ultimately marked the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War against the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Bengali nationalists declared him as the head of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh, while he was confined in a jail in West Pakistan.

After the independence of Bangladesh, Mujib returned to Bangladesh in January 1972 as the leader of a war-devastated country. In the following years, he played an important role in rebuilding Bangladesh, constructing a secular constitution for the country, transforming Pakistani era state apparatus, bureaucracy, armed forces, and judiciary into an independent state, initiating the first general election and normalizing diplomatic ties with most of the world. His foreign policy during the time was dominated by the principle &quot;friendship to all and malice to none&quot;. He remained a close ally to Gandhi&#x27;s India and Brezhnev&#x27;s Soviet Union, while balancing ties with the United States. He gave the first Bengali speech to the UN General Assembly in 1974.

Mujib&#x27;s government proved largely unsuccessful in curbing political and economic anarchy and corruption in post-independence Bangladesh, which ultimately gave rise to a left-wing insurgency. To quell the insurgency, he formed Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini, a special paramilitary force similar to the Gestapo, which was involved in various human rights abuses, massacres, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and rapes. Mujib&#x27;s four-year regime was the only socialist period in Bangladesh&#x27;s history, which was marked with huge economic mismanagement and failure, leading to the high mortality rate in the deadly famine of 1974. In 1975, he launched the Second Revolution, under which he installed a one party regime and abolished all kinds of civil liberties and democratic institutions, by which he &quot;institutionalized autocracy&quot; and made himself the &quot;unimpeachable&quot; President of Bangladesh, effectively for life, which lasted for seven months. On 15 August 1975, he was assassinated along with most of his family members in his Dhanmondi 32 residence in a coup d&#x27;état.

Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s post-independence legacy remains divisive among Bangladeshis due to his economic mismanagement, the famine of 1974, human rights violations, and authoritarianism. Nevertheless, most Bangladeshis credit him for leading the country to independence in 1971 and restoring the Bengali sovereignty after over two centuries following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, for which he is honoured as &quot;Bangabandhu&quot; (). He was voted as the &quot;Greatest Bengali of all time&quot; in the 2004 BBC opinion poll. His 7 March speech in 1971 is recognized by UNESCO for its historic value, and was listed in the Memory of the World Register. Many of his diaries and travelogues were published many years after his death and have been translated into several languages.

==Early life and background==
=== Family and parents ===

Mujib was born on 17 March 1920 into the Bengali Muslim aristocratic Sheikh family of the village of Tungipara in Gopalganj sub-division of Faridpur district in the province of Bengal in British India. His father Sheikh Lutfur Rahman was a &quot;sheristadar&quot; (law clerk) in the courthouse of Gopalganj; Mujib&#x27;s mother Sheikh Sayera Khatun was a housewife. Mujib&#x27;s father Sheikh Lutfur Rahman was a &quot;Taluqdar&quot; in Tungipara, owning landed property, around 100 &quot;Bighas&quot; of cultivable land. His clan&#x27;s ancestors were &quot;Zamindars&quot; of Faridpur Mahakumar, however due to successive turns in the family fortune over generations had turned them middle class. The Sheikh clan of Tungipara were of Iraqi Arab descent, being descended from Sheikh Abdul Awal Darwish of Baghdad, who had come to preach Islam in the Mughal era. His lineage is; Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, son of Sheikh Lutfar Rahman, son of Sheikh Abdul Hamid, son of Sheikh Mohammad Zakir, son of Sheikh Ekramullah, son of Sheikh Borhanuddin, son of Sheikh Jan Mahmud, son of Sheikh Zahiruddin, son of Sheikh Abdul Awal Darwish. Mujib was the eldest son and third child in the family of four daughters (Fatima, Achia, Helen, Laili) and two sons (Mujib, Naser). His parents nicknamed him &quot;Khoka&quot;.

=== Childhood ===
As a child, Mujib was described as &quot;compassionate and very energetic&quot;. Either playing or roaming around. Feeding birds, monkeys and dogs. In his autobiography, Mujib mentions, &quot;I used to play football, volleyball and field hockey. Although I was not a very good player but still had a good position in the school team. At this time I was not interested in politics.&quot; Once the farmers in his village lost their crops and faced a near-famine situation, which had a great impact on Mujib. During these days, he usually used to distribute rice among the poor farmers and students from his own or collecting from others.

=== 1927–1942 ===
Mujib was enrolled in Gimadanga Primary School in 1927. In 1929, he entered the third grade of Gopalganj Public School. His parents transferred him to Madaripur Islamia High School after two years. Mujib withdrew from school in 1934 to undergo eye surgery. He returned to formal education after four years owing to the severity of the surgery and slow recovery. Mujib was 18 years old when he was married to eight years old Fazilatunnesa, widely known in Bangladesh as Begum Mujib, in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. They are second cousins.

Mujib began showing signs of political leadership around this time. At the Gopalganj Missionary School, Mujib&#x27;s political passion was noticed by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, who was visiting the area along with A. K. Fazlul Huq. Mujib passed out from the Gopalganj Missionary School in 1942.

==United Bengal politics (1943–1947)==
Mujib moved to Calcutta for higher education. At the time, Calcutta was the capital of British Bengal and the largest city in undivided India. He studied liberal arts, including political science, at the erstwhile Islamia College of Calcutta and lived in Baker Hostel. Islamia College was one of the leading educational institutions for the Muslims of Bengal. He obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the college in 1947.

===Muslim League activism===


During his time in Calcutta, Sheikh Mujib became involved in the politics of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, the All India Muslim Students Federation, the Indian independence movement and the Pakistan movement. In 1943, he was elected as a councillor of the Muslim League. In 1944, he was elected as secretary of the Faridpur District Association, a Calcutta-based association of residents from Faridpur. In 1946, at the height of the Pakistan movement, Mujib was elected as General Secretary of the Islamia College Students Union in Calcutta. His political mentor Suhrawardy led the center-left faction of the Muslim League. Suhrawardy was responsible for creating 36 trade unions in Bengal, including unions for sailors, railway workers, jute and cotton mills workers, rickshaw pullers, cart drivers and other working class groups. Mujib assisted Suhrawardy in these efforts and also worked to ensure protection for Muslim families during the violent days in the run up to partition.

===United Bengal Movement===

In 1947, Sheikh Mujib also joined the &quot;United Bengal Movement&quot; which was organized under the leadership of Suhrawardy, Abul Hashim, Sarat Chandra Bose and others to form an undivided independent Bengal outside the jurisdiction of India and Pakistan. Later, when the creation of the states of India and Pakistan was confirmed, a referendum was held to decide the fate of the Bengali Muslim-dominated Sylhet District of Assam Province. Sheikh Mujib worked as an organizer and campaigner for inclusion in Pakistan in the Sylhet referendum. He went to Sylhet from Calcutta with about 500 workers. In his autobiography, he expressed his displeasure about the non-adherence of Karimganj to Pakistan despite winning the referendum and the various geographical inadequacies of East Pakistan during the demarcation of the partition.

=== Student of law ===
After the partition of India, Mujib was admitted into the Law Department of the University of Dhaka. The university was created in 1921 as a residential university modelled on Oxford and Cambridge where students would be affiliated with colleges; but its residential character was dramatically changed after partition and students became affiliated with departments. Mujib suffered repeated bouts of police detention due to his ability to instigate opposition protests against the Pakistani government. His political activities were targeted by the government and police. In 1949, Mujib was expelled from Dhaka University on charges of inciting employees against the university. After 61 years, in 2010, the university withdrew its famously politically motivated expulsion order.

== Struggle for Bengali rights (1948–1971) ==

Mujib emerged as a major opposition figure in Pakistani politics between 1948 and 1971. He represented the Bengali grassroots. He had an uncanny ability to remember people by their first name regardless of whether they were political leaders, workers, or ordinary citizens. Mujib founded the Muslim Students League on 4 January 1948 as the student wing of the Muslim League in East Bengal. This organisation later transformed into the Bangladesh Chhatra League. During the visit of Governor General Muhammad Ali Jinnah to Dhaka, it was declared that Urdu will be the sole national language of Pakistan. This sparked the Bengali Language Movement. Mujib became embroiled in the language movement, as well as left-wing trade unionism among Bengali factions of the Muslim League. Bengali factions eventually split away and formed the Awami Muslim League in 1949.

Mujib was arrested many times. His movements were tracked by spies of the Pakistani government. He was accused of being a secessionist and an agent of India. East Pakistan&#x27;s Intelligence Branch compiled many secret reports on his movements and political activities. The secret documents have been declassified by the Bangladeshi government. The formerly classified reports have also been published.

===Founding of the Awami League===
The All Pakistan Awami Muslim League was founded on 23 June 1949 at the Rose Garden mansion on K. M. Das Lane in Old Dhaka, which was organized by Yar Mohammad Khan and Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani. Sheikh Mujib was elected as one of its joint secretaries. The term &quot;Muslim&quot; was later dropped from the party&#x27;s nomenclature. The Awami League sought to represent both Muslims and Pakistan&#x27;s religious minorities, including Bengali Hindus and Pakistani Christians. Hence, it dropped &quot;Muslim&quot; from its name to appeal to the minority votebanks. Suhrawardy joined the party within a few years and became its main leader. He relied on Sheikh Mujib to organise his political activities in East Bengal. Mujib became Suhrawardy&#x27;s political protégé. Prior to partition, Suhrawardy mooted the idea of an independent United Bengal. But in Pakistan, Suhrawardy reportedly preferred to preserve the unity of Pakistan in a federal framework; while Mujib supported autonomy and was open to the idea of East Bengali independence. Mujib reportedly remarked that &quot;[t]he Bengalis had initially failed to appreciate a leader of Mr. Suhrawardy&#x27;s stature. By the time they learned to value him, they had run out of time&quot;. At the federal level, the Awami League was led by Suhrawardy. At the provincial level, the League was led by Sheikh Mujib who was given a free rein over the party&#x27;s activities by Suhrawardy. Mujib consolidated his control of the party. The Awami League veered away from the left-wing extremism of its founding president Maulana Bhashani. Under Suhrawardy and Mujib, the Awami League emerged as a centre-left party.

===Language Movement===


The Awami League strongly backed the Bengali Language Movement. Bengalis argued that the Bengali language deserved to be a federal language on par with Urdu because Bengalis formed the largest ethnic group in Pakistan. The movement appealed to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan to declare both Urdu and Bengali as national languages, in addition to English. During a conference in Fazlul Huq Muslim Hall, Sheikh Mujib was instrumental in establishing the All-Party State Language Action Committee. He was repeatedly arrested during the movement. When he was released from jail in 1948, he was greeted by a rally of the State Language Struggle Committee. Mujib announced a nationwide student strike on 17 March 1948.

In early January 1950, the Awami League held an anti-famine rally in Dhaka during the visit of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. Mujib was arrested for instigating the protests. On 26 January 1952, Pakistan&#x27;s then Bengali Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin reiterated that Urdu will be the only state language. Despite his imprisonment, Mujib played a key role in organising protests by issuing instructions from jail to students and protestors. He played a key role in declaring 21 February 1952 as a strike day. Mujib went on hunger strike from 14 February 1952 in the prelude to the strike day. His own hunger strike lasted 13 days. On 26 February, he was released from jail amid the public outrage over police killings of protestors on 21 February, including Salam, Rafiq, Barkat, and Jabbar.

===United Front===


The League teamed up with other parties like the Krishak Praja Party of A. K. Fazlul Huq to form the United Front coalition. During the East Bengali legislative election, 1954, Mujib was elected to public office for the first time. He became a member of the East Bengal Legislative Assembly. This was the first election in East Bengal since the partition of India in 1947. The Awami League-led United Front secured a landslide victory of 223 seats in the 237 seats of the provincial assembly. Mujib himself won by a margin of 13,000 votes against his Muslim League rival Wahiduzzaman in Gopalganj. A. K. Fazlul Huq became Chief Minister and inducted Mujib into his cabinet. Mujib&#x27;s initial portfolios were agriculture and forestry. After taking oath on 15 May 1954, Chief Minister Huq travelled with ministers to India and West Pakistan. The coalition government was dismissed on 30 May 1954. Mujib was arrested upon his return to Dhaka from Karachi. He was released on 23 December 1954. Governor&#x27;s rule was imposed in East Bengal. The elected government was eventually restored in 1955.

On 5 June 1955, Mujib was elected to a newly reconstituted second Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. The Awami League organised a huge public meeting at Paltan Maidan in Dhaka on 17 June 1955 which outlined 21 points demanding autonomy for Pakistan&#x27;s provinces. Mujib was a forceful orator at the assembly in Karachi. He opposed the government&#x27;s plan to rename East Bengal as East Pakistan as part of the One Unit scheme. On 25 August 1955, he delivered the following speech.

Sir [President of the Constituent Assembly], you will see that they want to use the phrase &#x27;East Pakistan&#x27; instead of &#x27;East Bengal&#x27;. We have demanded many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word Bengal has a history and tradition of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. If you want to change, we have to go back to Bengal and ask them whether they are ready to accept it. So far as the question of one unit is concerned it can be incorporated in the constitution. Why do you want it to be taken up right now? What about the state language, Bengali? We are prepared to consider one unit with all these things. So, I appeal to my friends on the other side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.

Mujib was often a vocal defender of human rights. Speaking on freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, he told Pakistan&#x27;s parliament the following on 29 November 1955:-
For whom are you going to frame the Constitution? Are you going to give freedom of speech, freedom of action to the people of Pakistan? When you do not have any other law under which you can arrest a person, you haul him under this so-called Public Safety Act. This is the blackest Act on the statute book of Pakistan. I do not know how long such an Act will continue. I want to warn you. Sir, that you must do justice to all people without fear or favour. If justice fails, equity fails, fair-play fails, then we will see how the matter is decided.

Mujib often called for increased recruitment and affirmative action in East Pakistan. Bengalis were under-represented in the civil and military services despite making up the largest ethnic group in the federation. Mujib felt that Bengalis were being relegated to provincial jobs instead of federal jobs because most Bengalis could not afford to travel outside the province in spite of holding master&#x27;s degrees and bachelor&#x27;s degrees. A similar situation also prevailed under British rule when Bengali degree holders were employed mostly in the Bengal Civil Service instead of the pan-Indian civil service. In parliament, Mujib spoke about parity between East and West Pakistan on 4 February 1956 and said the following.

It was stated that at the time of partition there was only one I.C.S. officer in East Bengal and there were no Engineers. I say that Bengal with 16 per cent literacy has only such a meagre representation in the service. Sir, this fact must be realised that it costs an individual Rs. 200 to come from East Bengal to this place. If you recruit in East Bengal and give a job you will find a large number of people from East Bengal coming forward. There are such a large number of M.As. and B. As... (Interruptions)... Sir, my time has been spoiled.

Mujib later became provincial minister of commerce and industries in the cabinet of Ataur Rahman Khan. These portfolios allowed Mujib to consolidate his popularity among the working class. The Awami League&#x27;s demand for Bengali as a federal language was successfully implemented in the 1956 constitution, which declared Urdu, Bengali and English as national languages. East Bengal, however, was renamed East Pakistan. In 1957, Mujib visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1958, he toured the United States as part of the State Department&#x27;s International Visitor Leadership Program. Mujib resigned from the provincial cabinet to work full time for the Awami League as a party organiser.

===Suhrawardy premiership===

Between 1956 and 1957, Mujib&#x27;s mentor Suhrawardy served as the 5th Prime Minister of Pakistan. Suhrawardy strengthened Pakistan&#x27;s relations with the United States and China. Suhrawardy was a strong supporter of Pakistan&#x27;s membership in SEATO and CENTO. Suhrawardy&#x27;s pro-Western foreign policy caused Maulana Bhashani to break away from the Awami League to form the National Awami Party, though Mujib remained loyal to Suhrawardy.

Mujib joined the Alpha Insurance Company in 1960. He continued to work in the insurance industry for many years.

The 1958 Pakistani military coup ended Pakistan&#x27;s first era of parliamentary democracy as Muhammad Ayub Khan, the commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Army, overthrew the Bengali president Iskandar Ali Mirza and abolished the 1956 constitution. Many politicians were imprisoned and disqualified from holding public office, including Mujib&#x27;s mentor Suhrawardy. A new constitution was introduced by Ayub Khan which curtailed universal suffrage and empowered electoral colleges to elect the country&#x27;s parliament.

===Six point movement===

Following Suhrawardy&#x27;s death in 1963, Mujib became General Secretary of the All Pakistan Awami League with Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan as its titular president. The 1962 constitution introduced a presidential republic. Mujib was one of the key leaders to rally opposition to president Ayub Khan who enacted a system of electoral colleges to elect the country&#x27;s parliament and president under a system known as &quot;Basic Democracy&quot;. Universal suffrage was curtailed as part of the Basic Democracy scheme.

Mujib supported opposition candidate Fatima Jinnah against Ayub Khan in the 1965 presidential election. Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Pakistan&#x27;s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, drew huge crowds in East Pakistan during her presidential campaign which was supported by the Combined Opposition Party, including the Awami League. East Pakistan was the hotbed of opposition to the presidency of Ayub Khan. Mujib became popular for voicing the grievances of the Bengali population, including under-representation in the military and central bureaucracy. Despite generating most of Pakistan&#x27;s export earnings and customs tax revenue, East Pakistan received a smaller budget allocation than West Pakistan.

The 1965 war between India and Pakistan ended in stalemate. The Tashkent Declaration was domestically seen as giving away Pakistan&#x27;s gains to India. Ayub Khan&#x27;s foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto resigned from the government, formed the Pakistan Peoples Party, and exploited public discontent against the regime.

In 1965, Pakistan banned the works of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in state media. Censorship in state media spurred Bengali civil society groups like Chhayanaut to preserve Bengali culture. When Ayub Khan compared Bengalis to beasts, the poet Sufia Kamal retorted that &quot;If the people are beasts then as the President of the Republic, you are the king of the beasts&quot;. &quot;The Daily Ittefaq&quot; led by Tofazzal Hossain voiced growing aspirations for democracy, autonomy, and nationalism. Economists in Dhaka University pointed to the massive reallocation of revenue to West Pakistan despite East Pakistan&#x27;s role in generating most of Pakistan&#x27;s export income. Rehman Sobhan paraphrased the two-nation theory into the two economies theory. He argued that East and West Pakistan had two fundamentally distinct economies within one country.
In 1966, Mujib put forward a 6-point plan at a national conference of opposition parties in Lahore. The city of Lahore was chosen because of its symbolism as the place where the Lahore Resolution was adopted by the Muslim League in 1940. The six points called for abolishing the Basic Democracy scheme, restoring universal suffrage, devolving federal power to the provinces of East and West Pakistan, separate fiscal, monetary and trade policies for East and West Pakistan, and increased security spending for East Pakistan.
# The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense based on the Lahore Resolution and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a legislature directly elected on the basis of universal adult franchise.
# The federal government should deal with only two subjects: defence and foreign affairs, and all other residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.
# Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate banking reserve should be established and a separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.
# The power of taxation and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and the federal center will have no such power. The Federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.
# There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.
# East Pakistan should have its own security force.
Mujib&#x27;s points catalysed public support across East Pakistan, launching what historians have termed the &quot;six point movement&quot; – recognised as the turning point towards East and West Pakistan becoming two nations. Mujib insisted on a federal democracy and obtained broad support from the Bengali population. In 1966, Mujib was elected as President of the Awami League. Tajuddin Ahmad succeeded him as General Secretary.

===Agartala Conspiracy Case===

Mujib was arrested by the Pakistan Army and after two years in jail, an official sedition trial in a military court opened. During his imprisonment between 1967 and 1969, Mujib began to write his autobiography. In what is widely known as the Agartala Conspiracy Case, Mujib and 34 Bengali military officers were accused by the government of colluding with Indian government agents in a scheme to divide Pakistan and threaten its unity, order and national security. The plot was alleged to have been planned in the city of Agartala in the bordering Indian state of Tripura. The outcry and unrest over Mujib&#x27;s arrest and the charge of sedition against him destabilised East Pakistan amidst large protests and strikes. Various Bengali political and student groups added demands to address the issues of students, workers and the poor, forming a larger &quot;11-point plan&quot;. The government caved to the mounting pressure, dropped the charges on 22 February 1969 and unconditionally released Mujib the following day. He returned to East Pakistan as a public hero. He was given a mass reception on 23 February, at the Ramna Race Course and conferred with the popular honorary title of &quot;Bangabandhu&quot; by Tofail Ahmed. The term &quot;Bangabandhu&quot; means &quot;Friend of the Bengal&quot; in the Bengali language. Several of Bengal&#x27;s historic leaders were given similar honorary titles, including &quot;Sher-e-Bangla&quot; (&quot;Lion of Bengal&quot;) for A. K. Fazlul Huq, &quot;Deshbandhu&quot; (&quot;Friend of the Nation&quot;) for Chittaranjan Das, and &quot;Netaji&quot; (&quot;The Leader&quot;) for Subhash Chandra Bose.

=== 1969 uprising and Round Table Conference ===

In 1969, President Ayub Khan convened a Round Table Conference with opposition parties to find a way out of the prevailing political impasse. A few days after his release from prison, Mujib flew to Rawalpindi to attend the Round Table Conference. Mujib sought to bargain for East Pakistan&#x27;s autonomy. Mujib was the most powerful opposition leader at the Round Table Conference. Ayub Khan shook hands with Mujib, whom Khan previously had imprisoned. Talking to British media, Mujib said &quot;East Pakistan must get full regional autonomy. It must be self-sufficient in all respects. It must get its due share and legitimate share in the central administration. The West Pakistani people support [East Pakistani demands]. Only the vested interests want to divide the people of East and West Pakistan&quot;. When asked about the prospect of East Pakistan ruling West Pakistan if the Awami League gained power, Mujib replied that majority rule is important in a democracy but the people of East Pakistan had no intention to discriminate against West Pakistan, and that West Pakistani parties would continue to play an important role. Mujib toured West Pakistani cities by train after the Round Table Conference. West Pakistani crowds received him with chants of &quot;Sheikh Saheb Zindabad!&quot; (meaning Long Live the Sheikh!). He was received by huge crowds in Quetta, Baluchistan. He spoke to West Pakistani crowds in a heavily Bengali accent of Urdu, talking about &quot;chhey nukati&quot; (six points) and &quot;hum chhoy dofa mangta sab ke liye&quot;.

Mujib demanded that Pakistan accept his six-point plan for federal democracy. He wasn&#x27;t satisfied by Ayub Khan&#x27;s pledges. When he returned to Dhaka, he declared that East Pakistan should be known as &quot;Bangladesh&quot;. On 5 December 1969 Mujib made a declaration at a public meeting, held to observe the death anniversary of his mentor Suhrawardy, that henceforth East Pakistan would be called &quot;Bangladesh&quot;:

There was a time when all efforts were made to erase the word &quot;Bangla&quot; from this land and its map. The existence of the word &quot;Bangla&quot; was found nowhere except in the term Bay of Bengal. I on behalf of Pakistan announce today that this land will be called &quot;Bangladesh&quot; instead of East Pakistan.

Mujib&#x27;s fiery rhetoric ignited Bengali nationalism and pro-independence aspirations among the masses, students, professionals, and intellectuals of East Pakistan. Many observers believed that Bengali nationalism was a rejection of Pakistan&#x27;s founding two-nation theory but Mujib never phrased his rhetoric in these terms. Mujib was able to galvanise support throughout East Pakistan, which was home to the majority of Pakistan&#x27;s population. He became one of the most powerful political figures in the Indian subcontinent. Bengalis increasingly referred to him as &quot;Bangabandhu&quot;.

=== 1970 election ===


In March 1969, Ayub Khan resigned and Yahya Khan became president. Prior to the scheduled general election for 1970, one of the most powerful cyclones on record devastated East Pakistan, leaving half a million people dead and millions displaced. President Yahya Khan, who was flying back from China after the cyclone, viewed the devastation from the air. The ruling military junta was slow to respond with relief efforts. Newspapers in East Pakistan accused the federal government of &quot;gross neglect, callous inattention, and bitter indifference&quot;. Mujib remarked that &quot;We have a large army but it is left to the British Marines to bury our dead&quot;. International aid had to pour in due to the slow response of the Pakistani military regime. Bengalis were outraged at what was widely considered to be the weak and ineffective response of the federal government to the disaster. Public opinion and political parties in East Pakistan blamed the ruling military junta for the lack of relief efforts. The dissatisfaction led to divisions between East Pakistanis and West Pakistanis within the civil services, police and Pakistani Armed Forces.

In the Pakistani general elections held on 7 December 1970, the Awami League won 167 out of 169 seats belonging to East Pakistan in the National Assembly of Pakistan, as well as a landslide in the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. The Awami League emerged as the single largest party in the federal parliament of Pakistan. With 167 seats, it was past the halfway mark of 150 seats in the 300 member national assembly and had the right to form a government of its own. Sheikh Mujib was widely considered to be the Prime Minister-elect, including by President Yahya Khan. The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) came in second with 86 seats. The new parliament was scheduled to hold its first sitting in Dhaka, Pakistan&#x27;s legislative capital under the 1962 constitution. The political crisis emerged when PPP leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto declared that his party would boycott parliament if Mujib formed the next government. Bhutto threatened to break the legs of any West Pakistani MP-elect who accepted Mujib&#x27;s mandate. However, Khan Abdul Wali Khan of the Awami National Party from North West Frontier Province was open to accepting an Awami League government and travelled to Dhaka to meet with Mujib. Many in Pakistan&#x27;s establishment were opposed to Mujib becoming Pakistan&#x27;s prime minister. At the time neither Mujib nor the Awami League had explicitly advocated political independence for East Pakistan, but smaller nationalist groups were demanding independence for &quot;Bangladesh&quot;. After the election victory, Mujib was ornamented as &quot;Sher-e-Pakistan&quot; (Lion of Pakistan) on a newspaper ad published on The Daily Ittefaq on 3 January 1971.

Both Bhutto and Yahya Khan travelled to Dhaka for negotiations with the Awami League. Mujib&#x27;s delegation included the notable lawyer and constitutional expert Kamal Hossain. The Bengali negotiating position is extensively discussed in Kamal Hossain&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Bangladesh: Quest for Freedom and Justice&quot;. The Pakistani government was represented by former chief justice Alvin Robert Cornelius. At the InterContinental Dhaka, Bengali chefs refused to cook food for Yahya Khan. Governor Sahabzada Yaqub Khan requested the Awami League to end the strike of the chefs at the InterContinental Hotel.

Bhutto feared civil war, and sent a secret message to Mujib and his inner circle to arrange a meeting with them. Mubashir Hassan met with Mujib and persuaded him to form a coalition government with Bhutto. They decided that Bhutto would serve as president, with Mujib as Prime Minister. These developments took place secretly and no Pakistan Armed Forces personnel were kept informed. Meanwhile, Bhutto increased the pressure on Yahya Khan to take a stand on dissolving the government.

== Imprisonment ==
===1938–1941===
In 1938, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman went to the house of Gopalganj Hindu Mahasabha president Suren Banerjee when his classmate friend Abdul Malek was beaten up. Sheikh Mujib was arrested for the first time in a case filed by the leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha when the scuffle took place there. After seven days in jail, Sheikh Mujib was released when the case was dropped through settlement. In addition, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was temporarily arrested twice for making a speech and staying at the meeting place during disturbances while being the vice-president of the Faridpur district branch of the All Bengal Muslim Chhatra League in 1941.

===1948–1972===
After the establishment of Pakistan, Sheikh Mujib was in jail for five days from 11–15 March 1948. He was arrested on 11 September of the same year and released on 21 January 1949. He spent 132 days in prison during this period. Then on 19 April 1949, he was again taken to jail and was released on 28 June after serving 80 days of imprisonment. At that point he spent 27 days in prison. In the same year, i.e., 63 days from 25 October to 27 December 1949 and 787 consecutive days from 1 January 1950 to 26 February 1952.

Sheikh Mujib had to spend 206 days in prison even after winning the United Front elections in 1954. Sheikh Mujib was arrested again on 11 October 1958 after Ayub Khan imposed martial law. At this time, he had to spend 1 thousand 153 consecutive days in prison. Then he was arrested again on 6 January 1962 and released on 18 June of that year. He spent 158 days in prison. Then in 1964 and 1965 he was in prison for 665 days in different terms. After making the six-point proposal, he was arrested at the place where he went to hold the rally. At that time, he held 32 public meetings and spent 90 days in prison for different periods. Then he was arrested again on 8 May 1966 and was released on 22 February 1969 through a popular uprising. At that time he was in prison for 1,021 days. He was arrested by the Pakistan government soon after declaring independence in the early hours of 26 March 1971. During this period he was in prison for 288 days.

==Establishment of Bangladesh==

===Civil disobedience===

The National Assembly was scheduled to meet in Dhaka on 3 March 1971. President Yahya Khan indefinitely postponed the assembly&#x27;s first sitting, which triggered an uprising in East Pakistan. The cities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Khulna were engulfed with protests. Amid signs of an impending crackdown, Mujib addressed the people of East Pakistan on 7 March 1971 at the Ramna Race Course Maidan. In his speech, Mujib laid out the political history of Pakistan since partition and told the crowd that &quot;[w]e gave blood in 1952; we won a mandate in 1954; but we were still not allowed to take up the reins of this country&quot;. While Mujib stopped short of declaring outright independence, he stated that the goal of the Awami League from then on would be eventual independence. He declared that the Awami League would collect taxes and form committees in every neighbourhood to organise resistance. He called on the people &quot;to turn every house into a fortress&quot;. His most famous words from the speech were the following.

This time the struggle is for our liberation! This time the struggle is for our independence!

Following the speech, 17 days of civil disobedience known as the non-cooperation movement took place across East Pakistan. The Awami League began to collect taxes while all monetary transfers to West Pakistan were suspended. East Pakistan came under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Awami League. On 23 March 1971, Bangladeshi flags were flown throughout East Pakistan on Pakistan&#x27;s Republic Day as a show of resistance. The Awami League and the Pakistani military leadership continued negotiations over the transfer of power. However, West Pakistani troops were being flown into the eastern wing through PIA flights while arms were being unloaded from Pakistan Navy ships in Chittagong harbour. The Pakistani military was preparing for a crackdown.

===Outbreak of war===

Talks broke down on 25 March 1971 when Yahya Khan left Dhaka, declared martial law, banned the Awami League and ordered the Pakistan Army to arrest Mujib and other Bengali leaders and activists. The Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight. Mujib sent telegrams to Chittagong where M. A. Hannan from the Awami League and Major Ziaur Rahman from the East Bengal Regiment announced the Bangladeshi declaration of independence on Mujib&#x27;s behalf. The text of Mujib&#x27;s telegram sent at midnight on 26 March 1971 stated the following:

Shortly after having declared the independence of Bangladesh, Mujib was arrested without charges and flown to prison in West Pakistan after midnight. Mujib was moved to West Pakistan and kept under heavy guard in a jail near Faisalabad. Sheikh Mujib was later moved to Central Jail Mianwali where he remained in solitary confinement for the entirety of the war. Kamal Hossain was also arrested and flown to West Pakistan while many other League leaders escaped to India. Pakistani general Rahimuddin Khan was appointed to preside over Mujib&#x27;s court-martial trial, the proceedings of which have never been made public. Mujib was sentenced to death but his execution was deferred on three occasions.

The Pakistan Army&#x27;s operations in East Pakistan were widely labelled as genocide. The Pakistan Army carried out atrocities against Bengali civilians. With help from Jamaat militias like the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams, the army targeted Bengali intellectuals, professionals, politicians, students, and other ordinary civilians. Many Bengali women suffered rape. Due to the deteriorating situation, large numbers of Hindus fled across the border to the neighbouring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura. Bengali army and police regiments soon revolted and League leaders formed the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. A major insurgency led by the Mukti Bahini arose across East Pakistan. Despite international pressure, the Pakistani government refused to release Mujib and negotiate with him. Mujib&#x27;s family was kept under house arrest during this period. General Osmani was the key military commanding officer in the Mukti Bahini. Following Indian intervention in December, the Pakistan Army surrendered to the allied forces of Bangladesh and India.

===Homecoming===

Upon assuming the presidency after Yahya Khan&#x27;s resignation, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto responded to international pressure and released Mujib on 8 January 1972. Kamal Hossain was also released. Bhutto and Aziz Ahmed secretly met Mujib and Kamal Hossain in Rawalpindi. Bhutto proposed a last minute attempt at mediation through the Shah of Iran, who was scheduled to arrive the next day. Mujib declined the offer after consulting with Kamal Hossain. Mujib requested a flight to London. Both Mujib and Hossain were then flown to London. En route to London, their plane made a stopover in Cyprus for refuelling. In London, Mujib was welcomed by British officials and a policeman remarked &quot;Sir, we have been praying for you&quot;. Mujib was lodged at Claridge&#x27;s Hotel and later met with British Prime Minister Edward Heath at 10 Downing Street. Heath and Mujib discussed Bangladesh&#x27;s membership of the Commonwealth. Crowds of Bengalis converged on Claridge&#x27;s Hotel to get a glimpse of Mujib.
Mujib held his first press conference in nine months and addressed the international media at Claridge&#x27;s Hotel. He made the following remarks at the press conference.

I am free to share the unbounded joy of freedom with my fellow countrymen. We have won our freedom in an epic liberation struggle.

Mujib was provided an RAF plane by the British government to take him back to newly independent Bangladesh. He was accompanied on the flight by members of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh, as well as an emissary of India&#x27;s premier Indira Gandhi. The emissary was Indian Bengali diplomat Shashank Banerjee, who recounted Mujib smoking his trademark smoking pipe with Erinmore tobacco. During the flight, both men agreed that Bangladesh would adopt the Westminster style of parliamentary government. On Indira Gandhi&#x27;s hopes for Bangladesh, Banerjee told Mujib that &quot;on India&#x27;s eastern flank, she wished to have a friendly power, a prosperous economy, and a secular democracy, with a parliamentary system of government&quot;. Regarding the presence of Indian troops in Bangladesh, Mujib requested Banerjee to convey to the Indian government that Indian troops should be withdrawn as early as possible. The RAF de Havilland Comet made a stopover in the Middle East en route to Dhaka.

The RAF plane then made a stopover in New Delhi. Mujib was received by Indian President V. V. Giri and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, as well as the entire Indian cabinet and chiefs of armed forces. Delhi was given a festive look as Mujib and Gandhi addressed a huge crowd where he publicly expressed his gratitude to Gandhi and the Indian public.

After a few hours in Delhi, the RAF plane flew Mujib to Dhaka in independent Bangladesh. Before the plane landed, it circled the city to view the million people who converged on Tejgaon Airport to greet Mujib. In Dhaka, Mujib&#x27;s homecoming was described as &quot;one of the most emotional outbursts in that emotional part of the world&quot;. Crowds overwhelmed the airport tarmac and breached the security cordon as cabinet ministers went inside the plane to bring Mujib out. Mujib was given a guard of honour by members of the nascent Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy, and Bangladesh Air Force. Mujib was driven in an open truck through the dense crowds for a speech at the Ramna Race Course, where ten months earlier he had announced the liberation movement. Mujib&#x27;s emotional speech to the million-strong crowd was caught on camera by Marilyn Silverstone and Rashid Talukdar; the photos of his homecoming day have become iconic in Bangladeshi political and popular culture.

== Governing Bangladesh ==

Mujib briefly assumed the provisional presidency and later took office as the prime minister. In January 1972 &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that &quot;[i]n the aftermath of the Pakistani army&#x27;s rampage last March, a special team of inspectors from the World Bank observed that some cities looked &quot;like the morning after a nuclear attack&quot;. Since then, the destruction has only been magnified. An estimated 6,000,000 homes have been destroyed, and nearly 1,400,000 farm families have been left without tools or animals to work their lands. Transportation and communications systems are totally disrupted. Roads are damaged, bridges out and inland waterways blocked. The rape of the country continued right up until the Pakistani army surrendered a month ago. In the last days of the war, West Pakistani-owned businesseswhich included nearly every commercial enterprise in the countryremitted virtually all their funds to the West. Pakistan International Airlines left exactly 117 rupees ($16) in its account at the port city of Chittagong. The army also destroyed bank notes and coins, so that many areas now suffer from a severe shortage of ready cash. Private cars were picked up off the streets or confiscated from auto dealers and shipped to the West before the ports were closed.

The new government of Bangladesh quickly converted East Pakistan&#x27;s state apparatus into the machinery of an independent Bangladeshi state. For example, a presidential decree transformed the High Court of East Pakistan into the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The Awami League successfully reorganised the bureaucracy, framed a written constitution, and rehabilitated war victims and survivors. In January 1972, Mujib introduced a parliamentary republic through a presidential decree. The emerging state structure was influenced by the Westminster model in which the Prime Minister was the most powerful leader while the President acted on the government&#x27;s advice. MPs elected during the 1970 general election became members of the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh. The Constitution Drafting Committee led by Dr. Kamal Hossain produced a draft constitution which was adopted on 4 November 1972 and came into force on 16 December 1972. In comparison to the prolonged constitution-making process in Pakistan during the 1950s, the Awami League was credited for swiftly enacting the Constitution of Bangladesh within just one year of independence. However, the League is criticised for this swift enactment because the Constituent Assembly was largely made up of members from the League itself; the few opposition lawmakers included Manabendra Narayan Larma, who demanded the term &quot;Bangladeshi&quot; to describe the new country&#x27;s citizens instead of &quot;Bengali&quot; since not all Bangladeshis were Bengalis. Critics argued that in reality &quot;the Awami League sought to rule by Mujib&#x27;s charisma and build a political process by dicta&quot;.

Mujib introduced a quota for backward regions to get access to public sector jobs. Bangladesh also faced a gun control problem because many of its guerrilla fighters from the Liberation War were roaming the country with guns. Mujib successfully called on former guerrillas to surrender their arms through public ceremonies which affirmed their status as freedom fighters during the Liberation War. The President&#x27;s Relief and Welfare Fund was created to rehabilitate an estimated 10 million displaced Bangladeshis. Mujib established 11,000 new primary schools and nationalised 40,000 primary schools.

===Withdrawal of Indian troops===
One of Mujib&#x27;s first priorities was the withdrawal of Indian troops from Bangladesh. Mujib requested the Indian government to ensure a swift withdrawal of Indian military forces from Bangladeshi territory. A timeline was drawn up for rapid withdrawal. The withdrawal took place within three months of the surrender of Pakistan to the allied forces of Bangladesh and India. A formal ceremony was held in Dhaka Stadium on 12 March 1972 in which Mujib inspected a guard of honour from the 1st Rajput Regiment. The withdrawal of Indian forces was completed by 15 March. Many countries established diplomatic relations with Bangladesh soon after the withdrawal of Indian troops. India&#x27;s intervention and subsequent withdrawal has been cited as a successful case of humanitarian intervention in international law.

===War criminals===
In 1972, Mujib told David Frost that he was a strong man but he had tears in his eyes when he saw pictures of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. He told Frost that &quot;I am a very generous man. I always believe in forgive and forget but this is impossible on my part to forgive and forget. This was cold blooded murder in a planned way; genocide to kill my people. These people must be punished&quot;. Speaking about a potential war crimes trial, Mujib said &quot;the world powers arranged the Nuremberg trials against the war criminals of fascist Germany. I think they should come forward and there should be another trial or inquiry under the United Nations&quot;. Mujib pledged to hold a trial for those accused in wartime atrocities. An estimated 11,000 local collaborators of the Pakistan Army were arrested. Their cases were heard by the Collaborators Tribunal. In 1973, the government introduced the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act to prosecute 195 Pakistani PoWs under Indian custody. In response, Pakistan filed a case against India at the International Court of Justice. The Delhi Agreement struck a compromise between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh after the three countries agreed to transfer PoWs to Pakistani custody. However, the foreign minister of Bangladesh stated that &quot;the excesses and manifold crimes committed by those prisoners of war constituted, according to the relevant provisions of the UN General Assembly resolutions and international law, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and that there was universal consensus that persons charged with such crimes as [the] 195 Pakistani prisoners of war should be held to account and subjected to the due process of law&quot;. In 1974, the Third International Criminal Law Conference was held at the Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs; the meeting supported calls for the creation of an international penal court.

===Economic policy===
Mujib declared socialism as a national policy. His land reforms restricted land ownership to less than 25 &quot;bighas&quot; of land which effectively ended all traces of the &quot;zamindari&quot; system. Land owners with more than 25 &quot;bighas&quot; were subjected to taxes. Farmers had to sell their products at prices set by the government instead of the market. Mujib nationalised all banks, insurance companies, and 580 industrial plants. There was little foreign investment. The stock exchange remained closed. In 1974, the government sought to invite international oil companies to explore the Bay of Bengal for oil and natural gas. Shell sold five gas fields to the Bangladeshi government which set the stage for the creation of Petrobangla. The national airline Biman was set up with planes from British Caledonian, the Indian government and the World Council of Churches. In the industrial sector, the Bangladeshi government built the Ghorashal Fertilizer Factory. Work began on the Ashuganj Power Station. Operations in the Port of Chittagong were restored after the Soviet Navy conducted a clearing operation for naval mines.

Industrial activity was eventually restored to pre-1971 levels. Banking services rapidly expanded in rural areas. Mujib recruited CEOs from the private sector to run state-owned companies. The first Five Year Plan was adopted by the Planning Commission, which was headed by the Harvard-trained economist Nurul Islam. The Planning Commission sought to diversify Bangladesh&#x27;s exports. In trade with India, the Planning Commission identified fertilizer, iron, cement and natural gas as potential export sectors in Bangladesh. The Planning Commission, with Mujib&#x27;s approval, wanted to transform Bangladesh into a producer of value added products generated from imported Indian raw materials. In addition to state-owned firms, many private sector companies emerged, including the Bangladesh Export Import Company and Advanced Chemical Industries. These companies later became some of Bangladesh&#x27;s biggest conglomerates.

The Mujib government faced serious challenges, which included the resettlement of millions of people displaced in 1971, organisation of food supply, health services and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the economy of Bangladesh had immensely deteriorated due to the conflict. In 1973, thousands of Bengalis arrived from Pakistan while many non-Bengali industrialists and capitalists emigrated; poorer non-Bengalis were stranded in refugee camps. Major efforts were launched to help an estimated 10 million former refugees who returned from India. The economy began to recover eventually. The five-year plan released in 1973 focused state investments into agriculture and cottage industries. But a famine occurred in 1974 when the price of rice rose sharply. In that month there was widespread starvation in Rangpur district. Government mismanagement was blamed. Many of Mujib&#x27;s socialist policies were eventually overturned by future governments. The five years of his regime marked the only intensely socialist period in Bangladesh&#x27;s history. Successive governments de-emphasised socialism and promoted a market economy. By the 1990s, the Awami League returned to being a centre-left party in economics.

===Legal reforms===
The Constitution of Bangladesh became the first Bengali written constitution in modern history. The Awami League introduced a new bill of rights, which was more broad and expansive than the laws of East and West Pakistan. In addition to freedom of speech and freedom of religion, the new constitution emphasized property rights, the right to privacy, the prohibition of torture, safeguards during detention and trial, the prohibition of forced labor, and freedom of association. The Awami League repealed many controversial laws of the Pakistani period, including the Public Safety Act and Defense of Pakistan Rules. Women&#x27;s rights received more attention than before. Discrimination on grounds of religion, ethnicity, gender, place of birth or disability was discouraged.

===Secularism===

While Pakistan adopted progressive reforms to Muslim family law as early as 1961, Bangladesh became the first constitutionally secular state in South Asia in 1972 when its newly adopted constitution included the word &quot;secularism&quot; for the first time in the region. Despite the constitution&#x27;s proclamation of secularism as a state policy, Mujib banned &quot;anti-Islamic&quot; activities, including gambling, horse racing and alcohol. He established the Islamic Foundation to regulate religious affairs for Muslims, including the collection of &quot;zakat&quot; and setting dates for religious observances like Eid and Ramadan. Under Mujib, Bangladesh joined the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in 1974. Bangladesh was not the only Muslim-majority secular republic in the OIC; others included Turkey and Nigeria. Secularism was later removed from the constitution by the military dictatorship in the late 1970s. Secularism was reinstated by the Supreme Court into the constitution in 2010.

Mujib said &quot;secularism doesn&#x27;t mean irreligiosity. Hindus will practice their religion; Muslims will practice their religion; Christians, Buddhistseveryone will practice their respective religions. No one will interfere in someone else&#x27;s religion; the people of Bengal do not seek to interfere in matters of religion. Religion will not be used for political purposes. Religion will not be exploited in Bengal for political gain. If anyone does so, I believe the people of Bengal will retaliate against them&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
In the early 1970s, Sheikh Mujib emerged as one of the most charismatic leaders of the third world. His foreign policy maxim was &quot;friendship to all, malice to none&quot;. Mujib&#x27;s priorities were to secure aid for reconstruction and relief efforts; normalizing diplomatic relations with the world; and joining major international organizations.

Mujib&#x27;s major foreign policy achievement was to secure normalisation and diplomatic relations with most countries of the world. Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth, the UN, the OIC, and the Non-Aligned Movement. His allies included Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India and Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia.
Japan became a major aid provider to the new country. Mujib attended Commonwealth summits in Canada and Jamaica, where he held talks with Queen Elizabeth II, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and New Zealand Prime Minister Norman Kirk. The Soviet Union supplied several squadrons of MiG-21 planes for the Bangladesh Air Force. China initially blocked Bangladesh&#x27;s entry to the UN in 1972, but withdrew its veto in 1974 which allowed Bangladesh to join the UN. The United States recognized the independence of Bangladesh on 4 April 1972 and pledged US$300 million in aid. Britain, Malaysia, Indonesia, West Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden were among the several countries which recognized Bangladesh in February 1972.

====Africa====
Mujib was a firm opponent of apartheid. In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 1974, Mujib remarked that &quot;In spite of the acceleration of the process of abolishing colonialism, it hasn&#x27;t reached its ultimate goal. This is more strongly true of Africa, where the people of Rhodesia and Namibia are still engaged in the final struggle for national independence and absolute freedom. Although racism has been identified as a serious offence in this council, it&#x27;s still destroying the conscience of the people&quot;. This was the first speech in the UN General Assembly to be spoken in Bengali.

Bangladesh joined the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) during the 4th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Algiers. Mujib told Nigerian leader Yakubu Gowon that &quot;if we had remained in Pakistan, it would be a strong country. Again, if India had not been divided in 1947, it would be an even stronger country. But, then, Mr. President, in life do we always get what we desire?&quot;. The comment was in response to Gowon questioning the need for the break up of Pakistan. Mujib met Zambian leader Kenneth Kaunda and Senegalese president Léopold Sédar Senghor. He developed a good rapport with President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, who gifted 30 tanks to the Bangladeshi military in return for Mujib&#x27;s support to Egypt. Algerian president Houari Boumédiène brought Mujib to the OIC Summit in Lahore on his plane.

====Middle East====
While addressing the UN General Assembly in 1974, Mujib said &quot;injustice is still rampant in many parts of the world. Our Arab brothers are still fighting for the complete eviction of the invaders from their land. The equitable national rights of the Palestinian people have not yet been achieved&quot;. While Israel was one of the first countries to recognize Bangladesh, the Mujib government dispatched an army medical unit to support Arab countries during the Arab-Israeli War of 1973. This was Bangladesh&#x27;s first dispatch of military aid overseas. Kuwait sent its foreign minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to persuade Mujib to join the OIC Summit in Lahore in 1974. The Lebanese foreign minister accompanied Sabah during the visit to Dhaka. Bangladesh enjoyed strong relations with the secular Arab government of Iraq. Mujib had a warm rapport with Sheikh Zayed of the UAE, with the two men joking about their names.

Egyptian president Anwar Sadat visited Bangladesh on 25 February 1974 to thank Mujib for his support during the 1973 war. Sadat became a close friend of Mujib. Algerian president Houari Boumédiène was instrumental in getting Bangladesh into the OIC. Mujib met with Takieddin el-Solh, the Prime Minister of Lebanon. He also met Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria. Mujib visited Iraq, Egypt, and Algeria. During his trip to Iraq, crowds of several thousand Iraqis welcomed him on the streets of Baghdad, Karbala and Babylon.

====South Asia====
Mujib and Indira Gandhi signed the 25-year Indo-Bangladeshi Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace. India and Bangladesh developed extremely cordial relations based on shared political values, a common nonaligned worldview and cultural solidarity. In February 1972, Mujib visited the Indian city of Calcutta in West Bengal to thank the people of India for their support during the liberation war. Mujib was immensely popular in India. Many of India&#x27;s leading film directors, singers, writers, actors and actresses came to meet with Mujib, including Satyajit Ray, Hemanta Mukherjee and Hema Malini. In Pakistan, a constitutional amendment was passed to establish diplomatic relations with Bangladesh. In the Delhi Agreement of 1974, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan pledged to work for regional stability and peace. The agreement paved the way for the return of interned Bengali officials and their families stranded in Pakistan, as well as the establishment of diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan. However, Bangladesh had to concede on the issue of putting 195 Pakistani PoWs on trial for war crimes, after the three countries agreed by consensus to transfer the 195 PoWs to Pakistani custody.

Mujib and Gandhi also signed a Land Boundary Treaty concerning the India-Bangladesh enclaves. The treaty was challenged in court. The government attempted to ratify the treaty without consulting parliament. Chief Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem ruled that parliament had to ratify the treaty in accordance with the constitution, otherwise the government&#x27;s actions were illegal and unconstitutional. The Chief Justice dissented with the government&#x27;s actions. The treaty was subsequently ratified by parliament. In his decision, Justice Sayem referred to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The land boundary treaty was finally implemented in 2015.

===Left-wing insurgency===
At the height of Mujib&#x27;s power, left-wing insurgents from the Gonobahini fought against Mujib&#x27;s government to establish a Marxist government. The government responded by forming an elite paramilitary force called Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini on 8 February 1972. Many within the Bangladeshi military viewed the new paramilitary force with suspicion. The new paramilitary force was responsible for human rights abuses against the general populace, including extrajudicial killings, shootings by death squads, and rape. Members of the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini were granted immunity from prosecution and other legal proceedings. The force swore an oath of loyalty to Mujib.

===One-party state===

Mujib&#x27;s political philosophy dramatically changed in 1975. Elections were approaching in 1977 after the end of his five-year term. Mujib sensed growing dissatisfaction with his regime. He changed the constitution, declared himself president, and established a one party state. Ahrar Ahmed, commenting in &quot;The Daily Star&quot;, noted that &quot;Drastic changes were introduced through the adoption of the 4th amendment on Jan[uary] 25, 1975, which radically shifted the initial focus of the constitution and turned it into a single-party, presidential system, which curtailed the powers of the parliament and the judiciary, as well as the space for free speech or public assembly&quot;. Censorship was imposed in the press. Civil society groups like the Committee for Civil Liberties and Legal Aid were suppressed. The Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL), meaning the &quot;Bangladesh Farmers Workers Peoples League&quot;, became the only legal political party. Bureaucrats and military officers were ordered to join the single party. These actions profoundly impacted Mujib&#x27;s legacy. Many Bangladeshis opposed to the Awami League cite his creation of BAKSAL as the ultimate hypocrisy. The one party state lasted for 7 months till Mujib&#x27;s assassination on 15 August 1975.

== Assassination ==

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated along with most of his family in his personal residence on 15 August 1975 during a military coup by renegade army officers. His wife, brother, three sons, two daughters-in-law, and hosts of other relatives, personal staff, police officers, a brigadier general of the Bangladesh Army and many others were killed during the coup. More than 40 people got injured. The army chief K. M. Shafiullah was caught unaware and failed to stop the coup. Mujib was shot on the staircase of his house. Curfew was imposed after his death was announced on Bangladesh Radio nationwide.

Mujib was warned by many including the Indian intelligence about a possible coup. Mujib shrugged off these warnings by saying his own people would never hurt him. Moreover, being the president, he did not stay in Bangabhaban but stayed in his unguarded house at 32 Dhanmondi. German politician and federal chancellor Willy Brandt said in emotion, &quot;Bengalis can no longer be trusted after the killing of Sheikh Mujib. Those who killed Mujib can do any heinous act.&quot;

===Funeral and memorials===
On 16 August 1975, Mujib&#x27;s coffin was taken to his birthplace Tungipara in an army helicopter. He was buried next to his parents after his funeral led by Sheikh Abdul Halim. Others were buried in the Banani graveyard of Dhaka. The national flag was kept at half-mast by the locals in several government and non-government institutions in honour of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib. During the time, the Bangladesh national football team was in the Merdeka Tournament in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. There the national flag of Bangladesh was kept at half-mast on the day of Bangladesh&#x27;s match. Prior to match, the players observed a minute&#x27;s silence for Mujib and his eldest son Sheikh Kamal, who was a keen sportsman and the founder of Abahani Limited Dhaka.

Absentee funeral prayers were held in the Eidgah field of Jessore, Dhanmondi of Dhaka and Baitul Mukarram National Mosque. Thousands of people joined the mass procession led by the students of Dhaka University and special prayer in Dhaka on 4 November 1975. Heads of state, political figures and media of several countries including United States, United Kingdom, India, Iraq and Palestine mourned Mujib&#x27;s death. Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro stated upon Mujib&#x27;s death, &quot;The oppressed people of the world have lost a great leader of theirs in the death of Sheikh Mujib. And I have lost a truly large-hearted ally.&quot;

Today, Mujib rests beside his parents&#x27; graves in a white marble tomb in his native Tungipara. His personal residence where he was assassinated along with most of his family members, was opened as Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. It was demolished by mobs in 2025.

===Aftermath===
After the coup, a martial law regime was established. Four allies of Mujib who led the Provisional Government of Bangladesh in 1971 were arrested and eventually executed on 3 November 1975. Mujib&#x27;s killers included 15 junior army officers with ranks of colonels, majors, lieutenants and havildars. They were backed up by Awami League politician Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who usurped the presidency. On the day of the coup, the junior officers ordered their soldiers to take over the national radio and television stations. They were all later toppled by yet another coup led by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf on 3 November 1975.

According to American investigative journalist Lawrence Lifschultz, the army&#x27;s deputy chief Ziaur Rahman was approached by the coup plotters and expressed interest in the proposed coup plan, but refused to become the public face of the coup. Zia did not deny meeting with the coup plotters, according to Anthony Mascarenhas. Zia was legally obliged to prevent a mutiny against the country&#x27;s legally appointed president but did not stop the impending mutiny despite having knowledge of it. The only survivors from Mujib&#x27;s family were his daughters Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, who were visiting Hasina&#x27;s physicist husband in West Germany at the time. After the coup, they were barred from returning to Bangladesh and were granted asylum by India. Sheikh Hasina lived in New Delhi in exile before returning to Bangladesh on 17 May 1981. On 26 September 1975, the martial law regime introduced the Indemnity Ordinance, 1975, which gave legal immunity to all persons involved in the coup of 15 August 1975.

His assassins continued to enjoy immunity from prosecution for 26 years. The Indemnity Ordinance was repealed in 1996 after his daughter Sheikh Hasina was elected as prime minister. A murder case was subsequently initiated in the courts of Bangladesh. Several of the 15 assassins, including coup leader Sayed Farooq-ur-Rahman, were arrested and put on trial. Others like Khandaker Abdur Rashid became fugitives. The 15 were given the death penalty by a court in 1998. Five of the convicts were hanged in 2010. A sixth convict was hanged in 2020. Of the remaining fugitives, a few have died or are in hiding. In 2022, the Bangladeshi government reported that five fugitives are still on the run, including coup leader Rashid. One of the convicted assassins is living in Canada. One of the convicts is living in the United States. Bangladesh has requested Canada and the United States to deport the fugitives following the precedent set by the deportation of A. K. M. Mohiuddin Ahmed in 2007.

==Principles and ideology==

Mujib&#x27;s statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, ideology and beliefs, including what influenced him. These consist of four fundamental policies:

* Nationalism
* Socialism
* Democracy
* Secularism

When the Constitution of Bangladesh was adopted in 1972, the four policies became the four fundamental state policies of Bangladesh.

== Electoral history ==

== Legacy ==

Mujib continues to be a revered, popular, divisive, and controversial figure in Bangladesh. Opponents of the League are fierce critics of Mujib&#x27;s populism and authoritarianism, including his creation of BAKSAL. League supporters and other Bangladeshis credit Mujib for successfully leading the country to independence in 1971. However, Mujib&#x27;s socialist and economic policies after 1971 are largely frowned upon except among his most loyal supporters and family members.

In 2004, listeners of the BBC Bangla radio service ranked Mujib first among the &quot;20 Greatest Bengalis&quot;, ahead of Asia&#x27;s first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore; Bangladesh&#x27;s national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam; and other Bengali icons like Subhash Chandra Bose, Amartya Sen, Titumir, Begum Rokeya, Muhammad Yunus, and Ziaur Rahman.

===Cult of personality===

During his daughter Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s rule from 2009 to 2024, the Awami League had ruled Bangladesh based on a cult of personality around his legacy. His birthday, along with the National Children&#x27;s Day, and assassination day were designated as an official public holiday. Many roads, institutions, military bases, bridges and other places in Bangladesh were named or renamed after him during Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s tenure. Under the Awami League&#x27;s rule, Mujib&#x27;s picture was printed on the national currency Bangladeshi taka. Even a space satellite was named after him. In 2020, the Hasina government organised a year-long grand programme to mark the centenary of his birth.

This, combined with his mismanagement of the country post-independence, has led to an &quot;anti-Mujib&quot; sentiment among a large part of the people including the Awami League opposition in the country. Statues, murals and buildings related to Sheikh Mujib were vandalised after the Student–People&#x27;s uprising, which witnessed the fall of Hasina. Following the violent overthrow of Sheikh Hasina on August 2024, the cult of personality around Mujib is being systematically dismantled. The interim government formed after the fall of Hasina renamed some institutions previously named after Mujib.

=== Followers and international influence ===
Mujib is remembered in India as an ally. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Road in New Delhi and an avenue in Kolkata in the Indian state of West Bengal are named in his honour. The Palestinian Authority named a street in Hebron in honour of Mujib. Bangabandhu Boulevard in Ankara, Turkey is named after Mujib. There is also a Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Street in Port Louis, Mauritius. Sheikh Mujib Way in Chicago in the United States is named after him.

Archer Blood described Mujib as charismatic. Gary J. Bass wrote that &quot;Mujib&#x27;s very appearance suggested raw power,&quot; cabled Blood, &quot;a power drawn from the masses and from his own strong personality.&quot; He was tall and sturdy, with rugged features and intense eyes. Blood found him serene and confident amid the turmoil, but eager for power. &quot;On the rostrum he is a fiery orator who can mesmerize hundreds of thousands in a pouring rain,&quot; Blood wrote. &quot;Mujib has something of a messianic complex which has been reinforced by the heady experience of mass adulation. He talks of &#x27;my people, my land, my forests, my rivers.&#x27; It seems clear that he views himself as the personification of Bengali aspirations.&quot; According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;A man of vitality and vehemence, Mujib became the political Gandhi of the Bengalis, symbolizing their hopes and voicing their grievances. Not even Pakistan&#x27;s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, drew the million-strong throngs that Mujib has attracted in Dacca. Nor, for that matter, has any subcontinent politician since Gandhi&#x27;s day spent so much time behind bars for his political beliefs&quot;.

An Egyptian journalist noted that &quot;Sheikh Mujibur Rahman does not belong to Bangladesh alone. He is the harbinger of freedom for all Bengalis. His Bengali nationalism is the new emergence of Bengali civilization and culture. Mujib is the hero of the Bengalis, in the past and in the times that are&quot;. Fidel Castro remarked that &quot;I have not seen the Himalayas. But I have seen Sheikh Mujib. In personality and in courage, this man is the Himalayas. I have thus had the experience of witnessing the Himalayas&quot;. Mujib cited Abraham Lincoln, Mao Zedong, Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, Sukarno and Kemal Ataturk, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Suhrawardy, Subhas Chandra Bose, and A. K. Fazlul Huq as the individuals he admires during an interview with David Frost.

=== Honours ===


==== Father of the Nation ====
Mujib&#x27;s consideration as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; of Bangladesh is debated. Origin of this title is traced back to a public meeting on 3 March 1971 (during Non-cooperation movement) where A. S. M. Abdur Rab referred Mujib as &quot;The Father of the Nation&quot;. However, later claimed that Tajuddin Ahmad, the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh, was the first to refer Mujib as &quot;The Father of the Nation&quot;. The 1972 Constitution of Bangladesh declared Mujib to be &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;. On 8 March 1975, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani in a college foundation stone ceremony also addressed Mujib as &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;. In 2011, the Awami League-led parliament of Bangladesh passed the 15th amendment to the country&#x27;s constitution which referred to Mujib as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; in attached fifth, sixth, and seventh schedules covering his 7 March Speech, the declaration of independence on 26 March 1971, and the Proclamation of Independence issued by the Provisional Government on 10 April 1971. On 17 December 2024, 15th amendment was declared illegal by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. On 16 October 2024, Nahid Islam, an adviser to the interim government stated that they doesn&#x27;t consider Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib as the only Father of the Nation.

<doc id="246092" wikidata="Q2468975" url="?curid=246092" title="Modular origami">
<text>Modular origami or unit origami is a multi-stage paper folding technique in which several, or sometimes many, sheets of paper are first folded into individual modules or units and then assembled into an integrated flat shape or three-dimensional structure, usually by inserting flaps into pockets created by the folding process. These insertions create tension or friction that holds the model together. Some assemblies can be somewhat unstable because adhesives or string are not used.

==Definition and restrictions==
Modular origami can be classified as a sub-set of multi-piece origami, since the rule of restriction to one sheet of paper is abandoned. However, all the other rules of origami still apply, so the use of glue, thread, or any other fastening that is not a part of the sheet of paper is not generally acceptable in modular origami.

The additional restrictions that distinguish modular origami from other forms of multi-piece origami are using many identical copies of any folded unit, and linking them together in a symmetrical or repeating fashion to complete the model. There is a common misconception that treats all multi-piece origami as modular.

More than one &quot;type&quot; of module can still be used. Typically this means using separate linking units hidden from sight to hold parts of the construction together. Any other usage is generally discouraged.

==History==
The first historical evidence for a modular origami design comes from a Japanese book by Hayato Ohoka published in 1734 called &quot;Ranma Zushiki&quot;. It contains a print that shows a group of traditional origami models, one of which is a modular cube. The cube is pictured twice (from slightly different angles) and is identified in the accompanying text as a &quot;tamatebako&quot; (magic treasure chest). 

Isao Honda&#x27;s &quot;World of Origami&quot; (published in 1965) appears to have the same model, where it is called a &quot;cubical box&quot;. The six modules required for this design were developed from the traditional Japanese paperfold commonly known as the &quot;menko&quot;. Each module forms one face of the finished cube. 

There are several other traditional Japanese modular designs, including balls of folded paper flowers known as &quot;kusudama&quot;, or medicine balls. These designs are not integrated and are commonly strung together with thread. The term &quot;kusudama&quot; is sometimes, rather inaccurately, used to describe any three-dimensional modular origami structure resembling a ball.

There are also a few modular designs in the Chinese paperfolding tradition, notably the pagoda (from Maying Soong) and the lotus made from Joss paper.

Most traditional designs are however single-piece and the possibilities inherent in the modular origami idea were not explored further until the 1960s when the technique was re-invented by Robert Neale in the US and later by Mitsunobu Sonobe in Japan. The 1970s saw a sudden period of interest and development in modular origami as its own distinct field, leading to its present status in origami folding. One notable figure is Steve Krimball, who discovered the potential in Sonobe&#x27;s cube unit and demonstrated that it could be used to make alternative polyhedral shapes, including a 30-piece ball.

Since then, the modular origami technique has been popularized and developed extensively, and now there have been thousands of designs developed in this repertoire.

Notable modular origami artists include Robert Neale, Mitsunobu Sonobe, Tomoko Fuse, Kunihiko Kasahara, Tom Hull, Heinz Strobl, Rona Gurkewitz, Meenakshi Mukerji, and Ekaterina Lukasheva.

==Types==

Modular origami forms may be flat or three-dimensional. Flat forms are usually polygons (sometimes known as coasters), stars, rotors, and rings. Three-dimensional forms tend to be regular polyhedra or tessellations of simple polyhedra.

Modular origami techniques can be used to create a wide range of lidded boxes in many shapes. Many examples of such boxes are shown in Tomoko Fuse&#x27;s books &quot;Origami Boxes&quot; (1989), &quot;Fabulous Origami Boxes&quot; (1998)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Tomoko Fuse&#x27;s Origami Boxes&quot; (2018). 

There are some modular origami that are approximations of fractals, such as Menger&#x27;s sponge. Macro-modular origami is a form of modular origami in which finished assemblies are themselves used as the building blocks to create larger integrated structures. Such structures are described in Tomoko Fuse&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;Unit Origami-Multidimensional Transformations&quot;.

==Modeling systems==
===Robert Neale&#x27;s penultimate module===
Neale developed a system to model equilateral polyhedra based on a module with variable vertex angles. Each module has two pockets and two tabs, on opposite sides. The angle of each tab can be changed independently of the other tab. Each pocket can receive tabs of any angle. The most common angles form polygonal faces:
* 60 degrees (triangle)
* 90 degrees (square)
* 108 degrees (pentagon)
* 120 degrees (hexagon)
Each module joins others at the vertices of a polyhedron to form a polygonal face. The tabs form angles on opposite sides of an edge. For example, a subassembly of three triangle corners forms a triangle, the most stable configuration. As the internal angle increases for squares, pentagons and so forth, the stability decreases.

Many polyhedra call for unalike adjacent polygons. For example, a pyramid has one square face and four triangular faces. This requires hybrid modules, or modules having different angles. A pyramid consists of eight modules, four modules as square-triangle, and four as triangle-triangle.

Further polygonal faces are possible by altering the angle at each corner. The Neale modules can form any equilateral polyhedron including those having rhombic faces, like the rhombic dodecahedron.

===Mukhopadhyay module===
The Mukhopadhyay module can form any equilateral polyhedron. Each unit has a middle crease that forms an edge, and triangular wings that form adjacent stellated faces. For example, a cuboctahedral assembly has 24 units, since the cuboctahedron has 24 edges.
Additionally, bipyramids are possible, by folding the central crease on each module outwards or convexly instead of inwards or concavely as for the icosahedron and other stellated polyhedra. The Mukhopadhyay module works best when glued together, especially for polyhedra having larger numbers of sides.

<doc id="246093" wikidata="Q1218487" url="?curid=246093" title="NonStop SQL">
<text>NonStop SQL is a commercial relational database management system that is designed for fault tolerance and scalability, currently offered by Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The latest version is SQL/MX 3.4.

The product was originally developed by Tandem Computers. Tandem was acquired by Compaq in 1997. Compaq was later acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002. When Hewlett-Packard split in 2015 into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, NonStop SQL and the rest of the NonStop product line went to Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

The product primarily is used for online transaction processing and is tailored for organizations that need high availability and scalability for their database system. Typical users of the product are stock exchanges, telecommunications, POS, and bank ATM networks.

==History==
NonStop SQL is designed to run effectively on parallel computers, adding functionality for distributed data, distributed execution, and distributed transactions.

First released in 1987, a second version in 1989 added the ability to run queries in parallel, and the product became fairly famous for being one of the few systems that scales almost linearly with the number of processors in the machine: adding a second CPU to an existing NonStop SQL server almost exactly doubled its performance.

The second version added /MP to its name, for Massively Parallel. A third version, NonStop SQL/MX, created a product that was more ANSI SQL compliant than its predecessor. NonStop SQL/MX has shipped on the NonStop platform since 2002, and can access tables created by NonStop SQL/MP, although only &quot;Native SQL/MX tables&quot; offer ANSI compliance and many &quot;Oracle-like&quot; enhancements. The HP Neoview business intelligence platform was built using NonStop SQL as its origins. NonStop SQL/MX is HP&#x27;s only OLTP database product.

Parts of the Neoview code base were open sourced in 2014 under the name Trafodion, which is now a top-level Apache project.

<doc id="246100" wikidata="Q3047381" url="?curid=246100" title="Healesville Sanctuary">
<text>Healesville Sanctuary, formally known as theSir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary, is a zoo specialising in native Australian animals. It is located at Healesville in rural Victoria, Australia, and has a history of breeding native animals. It is one of only two places to have successfully bred a platypus, the other being Sydney&#x27;s Taronga Zoo. It also assists with a breeding population of the endangered helmeted honeyeater.

The zoo is set in a natural bushland environment where paths wind through different habitat areas showcasing wallabies, wombats, dingoes, kangaroos, and over 200 native bird varieties.

Guided tours, bird shows and information areas are available to visitors.

==History==

Dr Colin MacKenzie (knighted in 1929) set up the Institute of Anatomical Research in 1920 on of land formerly part of the Aboriginal reserve known as Coranderrk. The Reserve passed to the Healesville Council in 1927 and became the &quot;Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary&quot; in 1934.

The first platypus bred in captivity was born in the Sanctuary in 1943 when David Fleay managed it.

The park was placed under the management of the Victorian Zoological Parks and Gardens Board on 27 June 1978.

In 2009, the sanctuary was threatened by the Black Saturday bushfires, and the sanctuary evacuated their threatened species to Melbourne Zoo.

<doc id="246103" wikidata="Q747917" url="?curid=246103" title="The Complete Studio Recordings (Led Zeppelin album)">
<text>The Complete Studio Recordings is a ten compact disc box set by the English rock group Led Zeppelin, released by Atlantic Records on 24 September 1993. It contains all nine of the original Led Zeppelin studio albums digitally remastered, plus an expanded version of the posthumous release &quot;Coda&quot;. The discs are physically paired together in double-disc booklets and arranged in chronological order, with the exception of &quot;Presence&quot; (placed between &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;) being paired with &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; in order to keep the two discs of &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; together in the same case.

Four bonus tracks were added to the &quot;Coda&quot; disc. These were the previously unreleased &quot;Baby Come On Home&quot; which had appeared on &quot;Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2&quot; (1993), along with the previously unreleased tracks that had surfaced on the 1990 box set: &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot; and &quot;White Summer/Black Mountain Side&quot;, as well as the &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; B-side &quot;Hey, Hey, What Can I Do&quot;. This expanded version of &quot;Coda&quot; created for the box set was also later released to digital stores in 2007 with the digital release of the full Led Zeppelin catalog, but with &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot; omitted due to it already being included in &quot;BBC Sessions&quot; (1997).

The set also includes a booklet featuring an extended essay by rock journalist Cameron Crowe and photos of the band.

The album cover depicts the inside structure of a zeppelin.

This title was discontinued just prior to the launch of &quot;Mothership&quot;, and is now superseded by the &quot;Definitive Collection Mini LP Replica CD Boxset&quot;, released in September 2008.

<doc id="246107" wikidata="Q288646" url="?curid=246107" title="Furia gens">
<text>The gens Furia, originally written Fusia, and sometimes found as Fouria on coins, was one of the most ancient and noble patrician houses at Rome. Its members held the highest offices of the state throughout the period of the Roman Republic. The first of the Furii to attain the consulship was Sextus Furius in 488 BC.

==Origin==
The antiquity of the Furii is confirmed by the ancient form of the &quot;nomen&quot;, &quot;Fusius&quot;, found in the earliest days of the Republic. A similar process derived the nomina &quot;Papirius, Valerius&quot; and &quot;Veturius&quot; from &quot;Papisius, Valesius&quot; and &quot;Vetusius&quot;. This change probably occurred after the orthographic reform of Appius Claudius Caecus, passed during his censorship in 312 BC. History leaves us in darkness as to the origin of the Furia gens. A legendary figure named Spurius Fusius appears representing the Roman priests in the time of Tullus Hostilius. From sepulchral inscriptions found at Tusculum, we see that the name Furius was very common at that place, and hence it is generally inferred that the Furia gens, like the Fulvia, had come from Tusculum.

As the first member of the gens that occurs in history, Sextus Furius, BC 488, is only five years later than the treaty of isopolity which Spurius Cassius Vecellinus concluded with the Latins, to whom the Tusculans belonged, the supposition of the Tusculan origin of the Furia gens does not appear at all improbable. However, the cognomen &quot;Medullinus&quot;, which belonged to the oldest branch of the gens, may indicate that the family came from the ancient Latin city of Medullia, which was conquered by Ancus Marcius, the fourth King of Rome, toward the end of the 7th century BC.

The nomen Furius is a patronymic surname derived from &quot;Fusus&quot;, apparently an ancient praenomen that had fallen out of use before historical times. This name was preserved, however, as a cognomen used by many of the early Furii, including the families of the &quot;Medullini&quot; and the &quot;Pacili&quot;.

==Praenomina==
The principal names used by members of this family are &quot;Lucius, Spurius, Publius, Marcus, Agrippa, Sextus&quot;, and &quot;Quintus&quot;. The Furii Pacili used &quot;Gaius&quot;, a name not used by other branches of the gens.

Other praenomina appear towards the end of the Republic, and may represent plebeian branches of the family. The Furii Brocchi are distinguished by their use of &quot;Gnaeus&quot; and &quot;Titus&quot;. A poet during the late second century BC bore the praenomen &quot;Aulus&quot;, while a Furius of equestrian rank during the time of Cicero was named &quot;Numerius&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==

The cognomina of this gens are &quot;Aculeo, Bibaculus, Brocchus, Camillus, Crassipes, Fusus, Luscus, Medullinus, Pacilus, Philus&quot;, and &quot;Purpureo&quot;. The only cognomina that occur on coins are &quot;Brocchus, Crassipes, Philus&quot;, and &quot;Purpureo&quot;.

The oldest branch of the Furii bore the surname &quot;Medullinus&quot;, which may indicate that they had originally come from the Latin town of Medullia. All of the early Medullini probably bore the additional surname &quot;Fusus&quot;, probably an ancient praenomen that had fallen out of use before historical times, from which the nomen &quot;Furius&quot; (originally &quot;Fusius&quot;) was derived. This surname was also borne by the Furii Pacili, who were probably a cadet branch of the Medullini; Chase considers &quot;Pacilus&quot; a surname of Oscan origin, suggesting that this branch of the family had Sabine connections. &quot;Fusus&quot; was probably applicable to all of the early Furii, but was sometimes dropped or used in place of other surnames. Those Furii mentioned without any surname other than &quot;Fusus&quot; probably belonged to either the Medullini or the Pacili, and did not constitute a separate family.

The Furii Camilli were descended from the dictator Marcus Furius Camillus, one of the most famous heroes of the early Republic, credited both with the final defeat of Veii, and with driving the Gauls from Rome following the Gallic sack of Rome in 390 BC. He was a younger son of Lucius Furius Medullinus Fusus, who had thrice served as consular tribune. A &quot;camillus&quot; was a youth entrusted with certain religious obligations, a role likely to be filled by the younger son of a prominent magistrate. The family then vanishes during the last three centuries of the Republic, but reappears under the early Empire. According to Ronald Syme, their fortune was restored by Augustus, who tried to revive several impoverished patrician families.

Of the other surnames borne by families of the Furii, &quot;Aculeo&quot;, &quot;sharp&quot;, is probably derived from &quot;aculeus&quot;, a spur; &quot;Bibaculus&quot; originally referred to a tippler; &quot;Brocchus&quot; to someone with prominent teeth; &quot;Crassipes&quot; means &quot;thick-footed&quot;; &quot;Luscus&quot; &quot;one-eyed&quot;; and &quot;Philus&quot; is borrowed from the Greek Φιλος.

The cognomen &quot;Purpureo&quot;, &quot;rosy, purple&quot;, might originally have referred to a person&#x27;s complexion, but may also have alluded to the family&#x27;s wealth and influence, or some trading connection; a coin of this family depicts a murex-shell, the source of the expensive dye Tyrian purple, with which the most luxurious clothing was coloured. The &quot;toga picta&quot;, originally worn by the Roman kings, and later by triumphant generals, and the broad stripe of the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;, worn by senators and curule magistrates, were dyed with Tyrian purple. A similar reference to &quot;togae&quot; was made by a family of the patrician gens Sulpicia, which bore the cognomen &quot;Praetextatus&quot;.

There are some persons bearing the gentile name &quot;Furius&quot;, who were plebeians, since they are mentioned as tribunes of the plebs; and those persons either had gone over from the patricians to the plebeians, or they were descended from freedmen or a particular family of the Furii, as is expressly stated in the case of one of them.

==History==

The first written mention of Žatec is in the Latin chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg of 1004. In 1248, Žatec was firstly titled as a town. In 1265, it received the privileges of a royal town from King Ottokar II.

In the 16th century, Žatec had around 5,000 inhabitants and was one of the most populous towns in the kingdom. In 1827, a chain bridge over the Ohře, the first chain bridge in Bohemia, was built.

From the outbreak of the Hussite Wars in 1419 to the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was Hussite or Protestant, but after the Battle of White Mountain (1620) the greater part of the Czech inhabitants left the town. It remained an ethnically German town until 1945, when the Germans were expelled. On 3 June 1945, 5,000 male Sudeten German inhabitants from Žatec were marched to the town square of Postoloprty, and at least 763 were murdered. Estimates range up to 2,000 victims killed by Czechoslovak military on the march, in Postoloprty, and in Žatec on and after the march.

==Demographics==

Since 2003, the area south of the historic centre has been protected as an urban monument zone. It is valuable mainly for its technical constructions related to hop growing.

The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary is one of the most significant monuments. It was originally built in the Romanesque style and some of its Romanesque parts are still preserved. In 1724–1728, the Chapel of Saint John of Nepomuk was added. Around 1740, the west façade was reconstructed in the Baroque style.

The hop-growing and brewing tradition is widely presented by the town. There are Hop Museum and Brewing Museum.

<text>Hawke Bay (), formerly named &quot;Hawke&#x27;s Bay&quot;, is a large bay on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, surrounded by the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region. It stretches from Māhia Peninsula in the northeast to Cape Kidnappers / Te Kauwae-a-Māui in the southwest, a distance of some .

Captain James Cook, sailing in HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, entered the bay on 12 October 1769. After exploring it, he named it for Sir Edward Hawke, First Lord of the Admiralty, on 15 October 1769, describing it as some 13 leagues (about ) across. Hawke had decisively defeated the French at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759.
This part of the New Zealand coast is subject to tectonic uplift, with the land being raised out of the sea. For this reason, the coastal land in this area has significant marine deposits, with both marine and land dinosaur fossils having been found inland. The Napier earthquake of 3 February 1931 resulted in several parts of the seabed close to the city of Napier being raised above sea level. Because the central mountain ranges come close to the coast at the north end of the bay, much of the bay&#x27;s northerly coastline has deeply eroded tablelands that end in steep seaside cliffs which descend to narrow beaches.

Despite the bay being renamed &quot;Hawke Bay&quot;, without an apostrophe, the region surrounding it continues to bear the former name of &quot;Hawke&#x27;s Bay&quot;. Several medium-sized towns are located in the immediate surrounds of the bay, including Wairoa at the mouth of the Wairoa River and its flood plain in the north, the so-called &#x27;twin cities&#x27; of Napier and Hastings in the south, and the town of Havelock North slightly further inland. Napier Port serves as the main export port for the region, and is the second largest in the North Island by tonnage.

<text>Alberto Ascari (13 July 1918 – 26 May 1955) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Ascari won two Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles, which he won in and with Ferrari, and won 13 Grands Prix across six seasons. In endurance racing, Ascari won the Mille Miglia in 1954 with Lancia.

Noted for careful precision and finely-judged accuracy, Ascari was a multitalented racer who competed in motorcycle racing before switching to cars. He won consecutive Formula One world titles in and for Scuderia Ferrari, becoming the first Ferrari-powered World Champion and breaking several records across both seasons. He remains the last Italian to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, . This was sandwiched by an appearance in the 1952 Indianapolis 500, and winning the 1954 Mille Miglia.

As of 2024, Ascari and Michael Schumacher are Ferrari&#x27;s only back-to-back World Champions, and Ascari remains Ferrari&#x27;s sole Italian champion. As the first driver to win multiple World Championship titles, he held the record for most World Championship titles from 1952 to 1954, becoming one of four drivers to have held the record for most World Championship titles. Juan Manuel Fangio held the record from to (jointly with Ascari in 1954) and Schumacher has held the record since , although Schumacher also shares that record with Lewis Hamilton since .

When Ascari was a young child, his father Antonio Ascari, also a famous racing driver, died in an accident at the 1925 French Grand Prix. Ascari himself was later killed during a test session for Ferrari at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in 1955.

== Early life ==
Born in Milan, Alberto Ascari was the son of Antonio Ascari, a talented Grand Prix motor racing star in the 1920s, racing Alfa Romeos. A fortnight before Ascari&#x27;s seventh birthday, his father was killed while leading the 1925 French Grand Prix at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry; the younger Ascari had an interest in racing in spite of this, and later came to dominate Grand Prix racing like no other before him. Such was his passion to become a racing driver like his father that he ran away from school twice, and sold his school books to finance his racing. Ascari raced motorcycles in his earlier years. At the age of 19 he was signed to ride for the Bianchi team. In 1940, after he entered the prestigious Mille Miglia in an Auto Avio Costruzioni 815 supplied by his father&#x27;s close friend Enzo Ferrari, Ascari eventually started racing on four wheels regularly. In an interview, he famously said: &quot;I only obey one passion, racing. I wouldn&#x27;t know how to live without it.&quot;

In 1940, Ascari married a local girl. When Italy entered World War II, the family garage, by now run by Ascari, was conscripted to service and maintain vehicles of the Italian military. During this period, he and his partner fellow racing driver Luigi Villoresi established a lucrative transport business, supplying fuel to army depots in North Africa. The pair survived a ship they were aboard carrying lorries capsizing in Tripoli harbour. As their business supported the Italian war effort, it made them exempt from being called up for military service during the war.

== Career ==

Following the end of World War II, Ascari began racing in Grands Prix with the Maserati 4CLT. His teammate was Villoresi, who became a mentor and friend to Ascari. The pair were successful on the circuits in Northern Italy. He was nicknamed &quot;Ciccio&quot;, meaning &quot;Tubby&quot;. Formula One regulations were introduced by the FIA in 1946, with the aim of eventually replacing the pre-war Grand Prix structure. During the next four transitional years, Ascari was at the top of his game, winning numerous events around Europe. The 1948 San Remo Grand Prix was his first win. He also took second place at the 1948 British Grand Prix, which was organised by the Royal Automobile Club and is generally considered the first British Grand Prix, at the Silverstone Circuit. With Maserati he won the first 1949 Buenos Aires Grand Prix. His biggest success came when he and Villoresi signed for Scuderia Ferrari. The team boss Enzo Ferrari had been a great friend and teammate to Ascari&#x27;s father, and had taken a keen interest in his successes. In 1949, he won three more races, all with Ferrari. Driving a Ferrari, he also won the third 1949 Buenos Aires Grand Prix.

The first Formula One World Championship season took place in . The Ferrari team made its World Championship debut at the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix, the second race of the season, with Ascari, Villoresi, and the famous French driver Raymond Sommer on the team. At Monaco, Ascari became the youngest driver to score points and a podium position in Formula One at 31 years, 312 days, finishing second one lap behind Juan Manuel Fangio. The team had a mixed year as the supercharged Ferrari 125 F1 was too slow to challenge the dominant Alfa Romeo team, so Ferrari began working on an unblown 4.5-litre car. Much of the year was lost as the team&#x27;s 2-litre Formula Two engine was progressively enlarged. When the full 4.5-litre Ferrari 375 F1 arrived for the 1950 Italian Grand Prix, the final round of the championship, Ascari gave Alfa Romeo their sternest challenge of the year before retiring; he then took over teammate Dorino Serafini&#x27;s car to finish second. The new Ferrari then won the non-championship 1950 Penya Rhin Grand Prix.

Throughout , Ascari was a threat to the Alfa Romeo team, although initially he was undone by unreliability. After winning the 1951 German Grand Prix at Nürburgring, he also won the 1951 Italian Grand Prix, and was only two points behind Fangio in the championship standings ahead of the climactic 1951 Spanish Grand Prix, where Fangio won the race and his first title as the 33-years-old Ascari became the youngest runner-up. Although Ascari had taken pole position, a disastrous tyre choice for the race saw the Ferraris unable to challenge Fangio; Ascari finished fourth.
For , the World Championship season switched to using the 2-litre Formula Two regulations, with Ascari driving the Ferrari 500. He missed the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix as he was qualifying for the 1952 Indianapolis 500, at the time a World Championship event. He was the only European driver to race at Indy in its eleven years on the World Championship schedule; his race ended after 40 laps without having made much of an impression, as a result of a wheel collapse. Returning to Europe, he then won the remaining six rounds of the series to clinch the world title (also taking five non-championship wins) and recording the fastest lap in each race. He scored the maximum number of points a driver could earn, since only the best four of eight scores counted towards the World Championship. Aged 34, Ascari became Formula One&#x27;s new youngest champion until the 29-year-old Mike Hawthorn won it in ; Hawthorn had been Ascari&#x27;s teammate in 1951. Meanwhile, Fangio had missed most of the season after a crash in the 1952 Italian Grand Prix in June.

Ascari won three more consecutive races to start the season, giving him nine straight championship wins (not counting Indy) before his streak ended when he finished fourth at the 1953 French Grand Prix, which proved to be highly competitive. He won twice more later in the year for a second consecutive World Championship, becoming Formula One&#x27;s first two-time champion. Aged 35, he was also the youngest two-time champion and the youngest back-to-back champion, both records beaten by the 34-year-old Jack Brabham in , as the average age of a Formula One driver significantly decreased. The 1953 season is considered Ascari&#x27;s career high point as he had faced the returning Fangio for the opening race of the season, the 1953 Argentine Grand Prix in Buenos Aires, attended by Fangio&#x27;s home crowd. Additionally, it was widely expected that Ferrari was to be challenged by a resurgent Maserati, with Fangio at its helm. Instead, Ascari took pole position and achieved the first win of a season that set him on course for his second and last World Championship.
Following a dispute over his salary, Ascari left Ferrari at the end of the season and switched to Lancia for the campaign. As their car was not eventually ready for the final race of the season, Gianni Lancia allowed him to drive twice for Maserati, sharing the fastest lap at the 1954 British Grand Prix, and once for Ferrari. Ascari also won the Mille Miglia that year, driving a Lancia sportscar, surviving the dreadful weather and the failure of a throttle spring, which was temporarily replaced with a rubber band. When the Lancia D50 was ready, Ascari took pole position on its debut, the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix, and led impressively early on and set fastest lap before retiring with a clutch problem, meaning a full season of competing against Fangio&#x27;s previously dominant Mercedes was much anticipated. Ascari&#x27;s decision to move to Lancia is considered his career&#x27;s low point. Despite promises of a new car and more money, this did not come until the season was nearly over, by which time Fangio was unreachable. While waiting for the Lancia car, Ascari had to take guest drives for Maserati and Ferrari, and he finished the season without completing any of the four Grands Prix he entered.

Ascari&#x27;s season started promisingly, the Lancia taking victories at the non-championship races in Turin (Parco del Valentino) and at the Naples Grand Prix, where the Lancias took on and beat the hitherto all-conquering Mercedes. In a world championship event, the 1955 Argentine Grand Prix, he retired. During the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix on 22 May, Ascari crashed into the harbour through hay bales and sandbags late in the race after missing a chicane while leading, reportedly distracted by either the crowd&#x27;s reaction to Stirling Moss&#x27; retirement or the close attentions of the lapped Cesare Perdisa behind. Whatever distracted him, he approached the chicane too quickly, and chose the only way out and took his D50 through the barriers into the sea, missing a substantial iron bollard by about 30 cm. Although his car sank, Ascari was pulled into a boat and escaped with only a broken nose.

== Death ==

On 26 May 1955, Ascari went to the Autodromo Nazionale Monza to watch his friend Eugenio Castellotti test a Ferrari 750 Monza sports car. They were to co-drive the car in the 1000 km Monza race, having been given special dispensation by Lancia. Ascari was not scheduled to drive that day, but decided to try a few laps. He set off in street clothes and wearing Castellotti&#x27;s white helmet. As he emerged from a fast curve on the third lap, the car inexplicably skidded, turned on its nose, and somersaulted twice. Thrown out onto the track, Ascari suffered multiple injuries and died a few minutes later. The crash occurred on the &quot;Curva del Vialone&quot;, one of the track&#x27;s challenging high-speed corners. The corner where the accident happened was renamed in his honour, and was subsequently replaced with a chicane called &quot;Variante Ascari&quot;. The reasons and circumstances of the accident, including why Ascari, who was well known for his attention to safety, drove another driver&#x27;s car, and without his own lucky blue helmet (he had left it at home, and apparently reasoned that, after his accident in Monaco four days earlier, getting back to race driving as soon as possible was the best way to recover), never came to light.

In 2001, the Swiss newspaper &quot;Rinascita&quot; published the story of Angelo Consonni, who was seven years old at the time of Ascari&#x27;s death and was with his grandfather near the &quot;Curva del Vialone&quot;. Consonni said he saw two workers intent on crossing the road to reach a shed when he heard a car approaching; if the first worker was quick, the second hesitated and stopped. Soon after, the young Consonni felt a silence and saw the Ferrari spin around and overturn. Luigi Villoresi maintained that Ascari would have been afraid of being afraid. In 2014, the racing driver Ernesto Brambilla declared that he had seen the accident, confirming that the car spun around and overturned, excluding the hypothesis that the accident was caused by a spectator who crossed the track.
Motor racing fans from all over mourned, as Ascari was buried next to the grave of his father in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan, to be forever remembered as one of the greatest racers of all time. More than a million people took to the streets in Milan for his funeral. His distraught wife Mietta Ascari told Enzo Ferrari that were it not for their children she would have taken her life. Three days before he died, Ascari had told a friend: &quot;I never want my children to become too fond of me because one day I might not come back and they will suffer less if I don&#x27;t come back.&quot; Upon Ascari&#x27;s death, his friend and rival Juan Manuel Fangio lamented: &quot;I have lost my greatest opponent. Ascari was a driver of supreme skill and I felt my title last year lost some of its value because he was not there to fight me for it. A great man.&quot; Fellow racing driver Stirling Moss recalled Ascari as &quot;wonderfully good... he was rather better than good, he was very good indeed. He may have been as fast as Fangio... but he had not got the polish that so distinguished Fangio.&quot; Mike Hawthorn said that &quot;Ascari was the fastest driver I ever saw. And when I say that, I include Fangio.&quot;

Ascari&#x27;s death is often considered to be a contributing factor to the withdrawal of Lancia from motor racing in 1955, just three days after his funeral (although the company was also in considerable financial trouble, needing a government subsidy to survive), handing his team, drivers, cars, and spare parts over to Enzo Ferrari. He died aged 36 years and 10 months, exactly the same age as his father, who was also killed in an accident at Montlhery thirty years earlier. Both Ascaris won 13 Grands Prix, drove car number 26, and were killed in similar circumstances. His father&#x27;s death helped fuel Ascari&#x27;s deeply superstitious nature as he avoided black cats, was concerned about unlucky numbers, and did not allow anyone to touch the briefcase that contained his racing apparel, which included what he believed to be his lucky blue helmet and T-shirt, the goggles, and gloves. Ascari had also promised himself, after his father&#x27;s death, that he would never race on the 26th of any month, and that he would become the number one racing driver. In 2015, Ascari was included in the Walk of Fame of Italian sport. In 2016, unknown thieves stole the bronze busts, which were placed on the sides of the shrine, of Ascari and his father. Ascari&#x27;s bust was the work of Michele Vedani, while that of his father was created by the sculptor Orazio Grossoni.

== Legacy ==
Ascari was popular with fellow drivers and crowds because of his modesty and eagerness to praise the ability of his rivals; he is also considered one of the hardest drivers to pass. One criticism was the perceived lack of complete focus when he was chasing for the lead. For example, Enzo Ferrari said: &quot;When he had to follow and pass an opponent, he evidently suffered, not from an inferiority complex, but from a nervousness that did not let him express his true class.&quot; In the words of BBC Sport&#x27;s chief Formula One writer Andrew Benson, Ascari did not look &quot;much like the modern idea of a Formula 1 driver. His double chin and slightly chubby frame brought to mind a Milanese baker more than the lean, pinched athletes of the modern age. Yet this was a man who, for a period, dominated grand prix racing like no other has before or since.&quot; In his profile about Ascari, Benson further wrote that &quot;Ascari was a ruthless winning machine. He was a phlegmatic character who approached his racing with an analytical style. With his pale blue shirt and matching helmet, Ascari cut a distinctive figure in the scarlet Ferraris of the early 1950s. He sat upright, hunched slightly forward, closer to the large steering wheel than many of his rivals, his elbows forming sharper angles.&quot; About Ascari&#x27;s driving style, Enzo Ferrari said: &quot;Ascari had a precise and distinctive driving style, but he was a man who had to lead from the start. In that position he was hard to overtake, almost impossible to beat, in my estimation. Alberto was secure when he was playing the hare. That was when his style was at its most superb. In second place, or further back, he was less sure.&quot;

A street in Rome, in the Esposizione Universale Roma area, is named in Ascari&#x27;s honour, and the Autodromo Nazionale Monza and Autodromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez have chicanes named after him. In 1972, one of the chicanes at the Monza Circuit was named in his honour &quot;Variante Ascari&quot;.
In 1992, he was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. The British supercar manufacturer Ascari Cars, founded in 1994, is named in his honour. Italian-born American racing legend Mario Andretti counts Ascari as one of his racing heroes, having watched him at the Monza circuit in his youth. Ascari was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame in December 2017. He appears in Mark Sullivan&#x27;s novel &quot;Beneath a Scarlet Sky&quot;.

In 34 entries and 32 race starts, Ascari had 13 wins, 17 podiums, 14 pole positions, and 12 fastest laps, and won two World Championships, making him the first double World Champion and the first back-to-back winner; it was not until Michael Schumacher&#x27;s fourth World Championship (the second with Ferrari) in , the only other to do so, that a Ferrari driver won back-to-back titles. His rivalry with Juan Manuel Fangio was one of the greatest in Formula One; from 31 starts each, they combined for 27 wins, 30 pole positions, and 27 fastest laps, some of which were shared with others. Either Ascari or Fangio held the lead for at least one lap, often times it was both leading races and for more than a lap, in all except for two of the 37 Grands Prix (from the 1950 British Grand Prix to the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix). In total, they led 66.6% of 2,508 laps. Stirling Moss believed Fangio to be better but that Ascari was very close, while Denis Jenkinson of &quot;Motor Sport&quot; thought Ascari was better. Ascari was also called the prototype Jim Clark, as well as the last Italian Grand Prix star, being Ferrari&#x27;s sole Italian World Champion and Italy&#x27;s sole back-to-back champion. Ascari&#x27;s rivals thought him faster than Fangio. With a win ratio of more than 40%, Ascari was second only to Fangio at the time. With Ferrari, for which he drove from 1949 to 1953, he had 13 wins in 27 races, a ratio of 48%, the highest win ratio for a Ferrari driver.

Despite his short career, having fewer Grand Prix starts than any other World Champion, Ascari is generally considered among the greatest Formula One drivers. In 2009, an &quot;Autosport&quot; survey taken by 217 Formula One drivers saw Ascari voted as the 16th-greatest Formula One driver of all time. In 2012, the BBC listed Ascari as the 9th-greatest Formula One driver. In 2020, Carteret Analytics used quantitative analysis methods to rank Formula One drivers. According to this ranking, Ascari is Formula One&#x27;s fourth-best driver of all time. Similar objective mathematical models, such as Eichenberger and Stadelmann (2009, 12th when the 40 races started criteria is dropped), original F1metrics (2014, 9th), &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; (2018, 19th), and updated F1metrics (2019, 5th), consistently put Ascari among the top 20 greatest Formula One drivers ever. Although Fangio did not take part in the 1952 season, Ascari&#x27;s performance during that season is considered one of the best single-year performance of all time; he overwhelmingly beat several strong Ferrari teammates, including Giuseppe Farina, whom he beat 53.5 to 27 in total points. Based on a 2019 adjusted scoring-rate calculation, 1952 had the all-time largest margin between first and second in the championship standings, with 8.90 points per race for Ascari and 4.36 points per race for Mike Hawthorn.

Into the 21st century, Ascari continues to hold several Formula One records, some of which have since been equalled by fellow World Champions, such as Clark, Nigel Mansell, Sebastian Vettel, and Lewis Hamilton. During his career, Ascari had seven hat-tricks (pole positions, fastest lap, and race win) and five Grand Chelems (1952 French Grand Prix, 1952 German Grand Prix, 1952 Dutch Grand Prix, 1953 Argentine Grand Prix, and 1953 British Grand Prix); as of July 2023, only 26 drivers had secured a Grand Chelem, of which there had been 66 in total. Ascari is one of three drivers (Clark and Vettel) to have achieved this feat, meaning taking pole, fastest lap, race win, and leading every lap, in consecutive races. Ascari holds the records of most consecutive hat-tricks (4), most consecutive Grand Chelems (2, jointly held with Clark and Vettel), highest number of Grand Chelems in a season (3, jointly held with Clark, Mansell, and Hamilton), most consecutive fastest laps (7), most consecutive laps in the lead (304), most consecutive distance led (2,075 km), highest percentage of fastest laps in a season (75%), and highest percentage of possible championship points in a season (100%, jointly held with Clark). A 51-year record for most consecutive wins (7), which was held by Ascari, was first equalled by Schumacher in , then broken by Vettel (9) in , and broken again (10) by Max Verstappen in . He also held the record for the highest percentage of wins in a season (75) until 2023, when Verstappen broke Ascari&#x27;s 71-year record.

<text>Turdus is a genus of medium-sized mostly insectivorous or omnivorous birds in the wider thrush family, Turdidae. The genus name &quot;Turdus&quot; is Latin for &#x27;thrush&#x27;.

Most of the species are called thrushes; the term thrush is also used for many other birds in the family Turdidae, as well as for a few species belonging to other families. Some Old World species with fully or largely black plumage are called blackbirds, and one, the ring ouzel, still retains the Old English name ouzel, which, until the 17th century, was also used (as &quot;black ouzel&quot;) for the common blackbird; it is cognate with the German name Amsel for the same species. Some New World species are called robins, the best known of which is the American robin. Two other species have their own distinct names without &quot;thrush&quot;, fieldfare and redwing, derived from behavioural characteristics and plumage features, respectively.

The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with species in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Several species have colonised oceanic islands, and two European species have been introduced by man into Australia and New Zealand.

All the species are uniform in size and structure, with the great majority between 22–28 cm long; the smallest (Vanikoro island thrush) being 17–19 cm, and the largest (great thrush) being 28–33 cm. All have slender, medium-length bills. Plumage is far more variable; the only fully shared character is that the recently fledged juveniles are spotted on the breast and streaked on the back. Adult colours range from the &quot;classical&quot; thrush pattern of a plain brown back and a spotted breast (e.g. mistle thrush, song thrush), through all-brown (e.g. clay-colored thrush, black-billed thrush) or all-black (e.g. common blackbird, glossy-black thrush), pied (e.g. ring ouzel, white-collared blackbird), to orange- to red-breasted, either subtly (e.g. rufous-bellied thrush, grey-backed thrush) or boldly (e.g. American robin, red-throated thrush). Some show sexual dimorphism with the males brighter or more intensely coloured than the often browner females, while in others, the sexes are identical in plumage. All are omnivorous, with a mixed diet of invertebrates, fruit, and small seeds. The temperate northern hemisphere species are migratory to a greater or lesser extent to avoid the harsh freezing winters of northern Eurasia and North America, while the subtropical, tropical, and southern hemisphere species are generally nonmigratory. Many, or most, are noted for their melodious songs. Almost all occur in habitats with trees and shrubs, but many will also use open ground away from trees; some are highly adapted to rocky mountainous habitats, using steep slopes and rocks adeptly in predator avoidance. Many have adapted well to human presence and are common in urban and suburban gardens, while some are shy and avoid human presence, particularly where there is any history of bird hunting.

While some species have been split out of &quot;Turdus&quot;, the thrushes formerly separated in the genera &quot;Cataponera&quot;, &quot;Cichlherminia&quot;, &quot;Nesocichla&quot;, &quot;Platycichla&quot; and &quot;Psophocichla&quot; by various authors have been restored to the present genus in recent years.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Turdus&quot; was formally named by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The type species was subsequently designated as the mistle thrush. The name &quot;Turdus&quot; is the Latin word for a &quot;thrush&quot;.

===Current species===
The genus contains 104 extant species of which two are recently extinct:

<text>Dave Eggers (born March 12, 1970) is an American writer, editor, and publisher. He is best known for his 2000 memoir, &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;, which became a bestseller and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. Eggers is also the founder of several notable literary and philanthropic ventures, including the literary journal &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;, the literacy project &quot;826 Valencia&quot;, and the human rights nonprofit &quot;Voice of Witness&quot;. Additionally, he founded &quot;ScholarMatch&quot;, a program that connects donors with students needing funds for college tuition. His writing has appeared in numerous prestigious publications, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

==Early life==
Eggers was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in a family with three siblings. His father, John K. Eggers (1936–1991), was an attorney, and his mother, Heidi McSweeney Eggers (1940–1992), was a schoolteacher. The family moved to Lake Forest, Illinois, where Eggers attended public high school and was a classmate of actor Vince Vaughn.

Eggers attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign to earn a degree in journalism. However, his studies were interrupted by the deaths of both parents: his father in 1991 and his mother in 1992. These events were later chronicled in his first book, the fictionalized memoir &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;. At age 21, Eggers took responsibility for his younger brother, Christopher (&quot;Toph&quot;), and moved to Berkeley, California. His elder brother, William D. Eggers, is a researcher who has worked for several conservative think tanks, promoting privatization. Eggers&#x27;s sister Beth died by suicide in November 2001.

==Career==

Eggers began writing as a Salon.com editor and founded &quot;Might&quot; magazine in San Francisco in 1994 with David Moodie and Marny Requa, while also writing a comic strip called &quot;Smarter Feller&quot; (originally &quot;Swell&quot;) for &quot;SF Weekly&quot;.

&quot;Might&quot; evolved out of the small San Francisco-based independent paper &quot;Cups&quot;, and gathered a loyal following with its irreverent humor and quirky approach to the issues and personalities of the day. An article purporting to be an obituary of former 1980s child star Adam Rich (originally intended to be &quot;Back to the Future&quot; star Crispin Glover until Glover backed out) garnered some national attention. The magazine regularly included humor pieces, and several essays and nonfiction pieces by seminal writers of the 1990s, including &quot;Impediments to Passion&quot;, an essay on sex in the AIDS era by David Foster Wallace.

Eggers later recounted in his memoir &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot; that the magazine struggled to profit and stopped publication in 1997. An anthology of the best of &quot;Might&quot; magazine&#x27;s brief run, &quot;″Shiny Adidas Tracksuits and the Death of Camp&#x27; and Other Essays from Might Magazine&quot;, was published in late 1998. By this time, Eggers was freelancing for &quot;Esquire&quot; and continuing to work for Salon.

&quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;, published in 2000, Eggers&#x27; first book, is a memoir with fictional elements, and it focuses on his struggle to raise his younger brother in the San Francisco Bay Area following the deaths of both of their parents. The book quickly became a bestseller and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. The memoir was praised for its originality, idiosyncratic self-referencing, and several innovative stylistic elements. Early printings of the 2001 trade-paperback edition were published with a lengthy postscript entitled, &quot;Mistakes We Knew We Were Making&quot;.

In 2002, Eggers published his first novel, &quot;You Shall Know Our Velocity&quot;, a story about a frustrating attempt to give away money to deserving people while haphazardly traveling the globe. An expanded and revised version was released as &quot;Sacrament&quot; in 2003. A version without the new material in &quot;Sacrament&quot; was created and retitled &quot;You Shall Know Our Velocity!&quot; for a Vintage imprint distribution. He has since published &quot;How We Are Hungry&quot;, a collection of short stories, and three politically themed serials for Salon.

In November 2005, Eggers published &quot;Surviving Justice: America&#x27;s Wrongfully Convicted and Exonerated&quot;, a book of interviews with former prisoners sentenced to death and later exonerated. The book was compiled with Lola Vollen, a specialist in the aftermath of prominent human rights abuses and a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Institute of International Studies.

Eggers&#x27; 2006 novel &quot;What Is the What: The Autobiography of Valentino Achak Deng&quot; was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. Eggers also edits the &quot;Best American Nonrequired Reading&quot; series, an annual anthology of short stories, essays, journalism, satire, and alternative comics.

Eggers was one of the original contributors to &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; and helped create its section &quot;The Jump&quot;. He also acted as the first anonymous &quot;Answer Guy&quot;, a column that continued to run after he stopped working for the publication.

On November 7, 2009, he was presented with the &quot;Courage in Media&quot; Award by the Council on American-Islamic Relations for his book &quot;Zeitoun&quot;. &quot;Zeitoun&quot; was optioned by Jonathan Demme, who considered an animated film-rendition of the work. To Demme, it &quot;felt like the first in-depth immersion I&#x27;d ever had through literature or film into the Muslim-American family. ... The moral was that they are like people of any other faith, and I hope our film, if we can get it made, will also be like that.&quot; Demme, quoted in early 2011, expressed confidence that when the script was finished, he would be able to find financing, perhaps even from a major studio. However, in May 2014, &quot;The Playlist&quot; reported that the film was &quot;percolat[ing] in development&quot;. Demme died in April 2017, and the project has not been heard of since.

In the early 2010s, after six years without publishing substantive literary fiction following &quot;What is the What&quot;, Eggers began a three-year streak of back-to-back novels, each broadly concerned with pressing social and political issues facing the United States and the world in the twenty-first century. Eggers published his novel of the Great Recession and the 2007–2008 financial crisis, &quot;A Hologram for the King&quot;, in July 2012. In October of that year, the novel was announced as a finalist for the National Book Award.

Eggers followed this with &quot;The Circle&quot;, released in October 2013, and depicts the life of a young worker at a fictional San Francisco-based technology company shortly, as she faces doubts about her vocation due to the company&#x27;s seemingly well-intentioned innovations revealing a more sinister underlying agenda. Completing the productive spell, &quot;Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever?&quot; was published in June 2014. In November 2015, &quot;Your Fathers, Where Are They ...&quot; was longlisted for the 2016 International Dublin Literary Award, Eggers&#x27; fifth nomination for the award following earlier nominations for &quot;The Circle&quot;, &quot;A Hologram for the King&quot;, &quot;The Wild Things&quot;, and &quot;What is the What&quot;.

In April 2016, Eggers visited Israel, as part of a project by the &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; organization, to write an article for a book on the Israeli occupation, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War. The book was edited by Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman and published under the title &quot;Kingdom of Olives and Ash: Writers Confront the Occupation&quot; in June 2017.

In July 2016, Eggers published &quot;Heroes of the Frontier&quot;. Earlier the same year, a film adaptation of Eggers&#x27; earlier novel &quot;A Hologram for the King&quot; was released to mixed reviews and middling commercial performance. &quot;The Circle&quot;, a film version of Eggers&#x27; book, starring Emma Watson, John Boyega, and Tom Hanks (who had starred in the &quot;Hologram for the King&quot; adaptation), was released in April 2017. Eggers followed &quot;Heroes of the Frontier&quot; with &quot;The Monk of Mokha&quot; (2018), another nonfiction biography in a similar vein to &quot;Zeitoun&quot;, billed by the publishers as &quot;the exhilarating true story of a young Yemeni American man, raised in San Francisco, who dreams of resurrecting the ancient art of Yemeni coffee but finds himself trapped in Sana&#x27;a by civil war.&quot;

Eggers ended the decade by publishing two stylistically different novellas written concurrently. &quot;The Parade&quot;, published by Knopf in March 2019, was a spare, minimalist novella reflecting Eggers&#x27; long-standing concerns with humanitarian issues, global development, and Western perceptions of the developing world. According to the advance blurb from the publisher, the novel concerns &quot;two men, Western contractors sent to work far from home, tasked with paving a road to the capital in a dangerous and largely lawless country.&quot; Reviews were mixed: Positive notices included Andrew Motion&#x27;s writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;[Eggers&#x27;] novel may be sternly reduced in terms of its cast and language, but this leanness doesn&#x27;t diminish the strength of its argument&quot;, and Ron Charles in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;The Parade&quot; is &quot;a story that conforms to the West&#x27;s reductive attitudes about the developing world. Writers and politicians have long generalized about those individual cultures. A novel that lumps them together into a nameless, primitive nation only plays into that tendency.&quot;

&quot;The Parade&quot; was followed in November 2019 by another short novella, &quot;The Captain and the Glory&quot;, billed by Eggers himself as an &quot;allegorical satire&quot; of the Trump administration. In an interview with the publishers Knopf published on the McSweeney&#x27;s website, Eggers described the novel as &quot;an attempt to understand this era by painting it in the gaudy and garish colors it really deserves... This is part farce, part parable, and I do hope, though the Captain bears more than a passing resemblance to Trump, that the book will be readable when Trump is gone. That&#x27;s part of the reason I called it &#x27;An entertainment&#x27; on the title page. It&#x27;s a nod to Graham Greene but also the way I hope people will read it. It was cathartic to write, and I hope cathartic to read.&quot; As with &quot;The Parade&quot;, reviews were decidedly mixed, with much criticism noting that Eggers&#x27; satire struggled to keep up with or do justice to the events of the Trump era. In a review for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Carl Wilkinson expressed bemusement about the purpose of the book and its intentions, Hannah Barekat in &quot;The Spectator&quot; was critical of the &quot;heavy handed&quot; nature of the book&#x27;s satire, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, and &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; also found the book wanting.

In 2021, his novella &quot;The Museum of Rain&quot; was published, and according to the McSweeney&#x27;s website, the &quot;elegiac&quot; short story concerns &quot;an American Army vet in his 70s who is asked to lead a group of young grand-nieces and grand-nephews on a walk through the hills of California&#x27;s Central Coast. Walking toward a setting sun, their destination is The Museum of Rain, which may or may not still exist, and whose origin and meaning are elusive to all.&quot; The novel &quot;The Every&quot; was released in October 2021. The novel is a follow-up to his 2013 novel &quot;The Circle&quot;.

=== McSweeney&#x27;s and other ventures ===
Eggers is the founder of McSweeney&#x27;s, an independent publishing house known for its literary journal &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot;, which he began in 1998. McSweeney&#x27;s also publishes &quot;The Believer&quot;, a monthly journal edited by Eggers&#x27;s wife, Vendela Vida, and the now-defunct DVD magazine &quot;Wholphin&quot;.

In addition to his literary pursuits, Eggers is a dedicated philanthropist. In 2002, he and educator Nínive Clements Calegari co-founded &quot;826 Valencia&quot;, a nonprofit writing and tutoring center for children and young adults. The project has since expanded into a national organization, &quot;826 National&quot;, with chapters across the United States (Los Angeles; New York City; Chicago; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Boston). In April 2010, under the umbrella of 826 National, Eggers launched ScholarMatch, a nonprofit organization that connects donors with students to make college more affordable.

In 2006, he appeared at fund-raising events, dubbed the Revenge of the Book–Eaters tour, to support these programs.

In September 2007, the Heinz Family Foundation awarded Eggers a $250,000 Heinz Award (given to recognize &quot;extraordinary achievements by individuals&quot;) in the Arts and Humanities. In accordance with Eggers&#x27;s wishes, the award money was given to 826 National and The Teacher Salary Project.

===Visual art work===
While at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Eggers attended art classes. After the publication of &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;, he focused mainly on writing. Still, he publicly returned to visual art in 2010, with a solo gallery show at Electric Works in San Francisco, called &quot;It Is Right to Draw Their Fur&quot;. The show featured many drawings of animals often paired with phrases, sometimes out of the Bible. In conjunction with that exhibition, McSweeney&#x27;s published a catalog featuring 25 loose-leaf prints of the work featured in the show. In 2015, Eggers had his first solo museum exhibition at the Nevada Museum of Art called &quot;The Insufferable Throne of God&quot;. Eggers is represented by Electric Works, a fine art gallery in San Francisco.

Outside of exhibitions, Eggers&#x27; visual art contributions include the following:
* Provided album art for Austin rock group Paul Banks &amp; the Carousels&#x27; album &quot;Yelling at the Sun&quot;.
* Designed the artwork for Thrice&#x27;s album &quot;Vheissu&quot;.

=== Other ===
Ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Eggers wrote an essay about the U.S. national team and soccer in the United States for &quot;The Thinking Fan&#x27;s Guide to the World Cup&quot;, which contained essays about each competing team in the tournament and was published with aid from the journal &quot;Granta&quot;. According to &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Eggers was rumored to be a possible candidate to be the new editor of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; before the Review selected Lorin Stein.

==Activism==
Eggers&#x27;s book &quot;The Every&quot; was released in 2021, but he refused to sell the hardcover edition on Amazon, limiting the release to independent bookstores only. Since its release, paperback editions of &quot;The Every&quot; have been available on Amazon.

In 2022, Eggers&#x27;s books were among several titles banned in South Dakota schools because of sexual content. Eggers went to South Dakota to speak to authorities and students and offered any student who wanted one of the banned books a copy for free via his website.

In December 2022, Eggers traveled on behalf of PEN America to Kyiv, Ukraine. He published &quot;The Profound Defiance of Daily Life in Kyiv&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; based on his time in the war-torn country.

== Personal life ==
Eggers lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife, Vendela Vida, who is also a writer. The two met at a wedding in San Francisco in 1998 and married in 2003. They have two children together. Eggers was the primary guardian of his youngest brother, Toph, with whom he co-authored children&#x27;s books.

== Awards and recognition ==
Eggers has won numerous annual awards for specific works as well as lifetime achievement awards. He also received an honorary doctorate degree.

<text>The Asian thrushes are medium-sized mostly insectivorous or omnivorous birds in the genus Zoothera of the thrush family, Turdidae.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Zoothera&quot; was introduced in 1832 by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Vigors to accommodate a newly described species, &quot;Zoothera monticol&quot;, the long-billed thrush, which therefore becomes the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;zōon&quot; meaning &quot;animal&quot; with &quot;-thēra&quot; meaning &quot;hunter&quot;.

Two New World species traditionally regarded as &quot;Zoothera&quot; (varied thrush and Aztec thrush) actually belong elsewhere in the thrush family. A group containing Siberian thrush and the African species is not closely related to the other &quot;Zoothera&quot; and are now assigned to the genus &quot;Geokichla&quot;.

==Species==
The genus contains the following 21 species:
*Long-tailed thrush (&quot;Zoothera dixoni&quot;)
*Alpine thrush (&quot;Zoothera mollissima&quot;)
*Himalayan thrush (&quot;Zoothera salimalii&quot;)
*Sichuan thrush (&quot;Zoothera griseiceps&quot;)
*Long-billed thrush (&quot;Zoothera monticola&quot;)
*Geomalia (&quot;Zoothera heinrichi&quot;)
*Dark-sided thrush (&quot;Zoothera marginata&quot;)
*Everett&#x27;s thrush (&quot;Zoothera everetti&quot;)
*Sunda thrush (&quot;Zoothera andromedae&quot;)
*White&#x27;s thrush (&quot;Zoothera aurea&quot;)
*Scaly thrush (&quot;Zoothera dauma&quot;)
*Nilgiri thrush (&quot;Zoothera neilgherriensis&quot;)
*Sri Lanka thrush (&quot;Zoothera imbricata&quot;)
*Amami thrush (&quot;Zoothera major&quot;)
*†Bonin thrush (&quot;Zoothera terrestris&quot;) - extinct (c. 1830s)
*Guadalcanal thrush (&quot;Zoothera turipavae&quot;)
*Makira thrush (&quot;Zoothera margaretae&quot;)
*Russet-tailed thrush (&quot;Zoothera heinei&quot;)
*Fawn-breasted thrush (&quot;Zoothera machiki&quot;)
*Bassian thrush (&quot;Zoothera lunulata&quot;)
*Black-backed thrush (&quot;Zoothera talaseae&quot;)

==Traditional &quot;Zoothera&quot; species belonging elsewhere in family==
*Varied thrush (&quot;Ixoreus naevius&quot;) - related to other new world genera
*Aztec thrush (&quot;Ridgwayia pinicola&quot;) - related to &quot;Hylocichla&quot;

<text>The tenge ( or ; , ; ; sign: ₸ ; code: KZT) is the currency of Kazakhstan. It is divided into 100 tiyn (, ).

==History==
After the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, most of the formerly Soviet republics attempted to maintain a common currency. Some politicians hoped to at least maintain &quot;special relations&quot; among former Soviet republics (the &quot;near abroad&quot;). Other reasons were the economic considerations for maintaining the ruble zone. The wish to preserve strong trade relations between former Soviet republics was considered the most important goal.

The break-up of the Soviet Union was not accompanied by any formal changes in monetary arrangements. The Central Bank of Russia took over the State Bank of the USSR (Gosbank) on 1 January 1992. It continued to ship Soviet notes and coins to the central banks of the eleven newly independent countries, which had formerly been the main branches of Gosbank in the republics.

The political situation, however, was not favourable for maintaining a common currency. Maintaining a common currency requires a strong political consensus in respect to monetary and fiscal targets, a common institution in charge of implementing these targets, and some minimum of common legislation (concerning the banking and foreign-exchange regulations). These conditions were far from being met amidst the turbulent economic and political situation.

During the first half of 1992, there existed a monetary union where 15 independent states all used the ruble. Since it was clear that the situation would not last, each of them was using its position as &quot;free-riders&quot; to issue huge amounts of money in the form of credit. As a result, some countries were issuing coupons in order to &quot;protect&quot; their markets from buyers from other states. The Russian central bank responded in July 1992 by setting up restrictions to the flow of credit between Russia and other states. The final collapse of the ruble zone began when Russia pulled out with the exchange of banknotes by the Central Bank of Russia on Russian territory at the end of July 1993.

As a result, Kazakhstan and other countries still in the ruble zone were &quot;pushed out&quot;. On 12 November 1993, the President of Kazakhstan issued a decree &quot;On introducing national currency of Republic of Kazakhstan&quot;. The tenge was introduced on 15 November 1993 to replace Soviet currency at a rate of ₸ 1 = Rbls 500. In 1991 a &quot;special group&quot; of designers was set up: Mendybay Alin, Timur Suleymenov, Asimsaly Duzelkhanov and Khayrulla Gabzhalilov. Thus 15 November is celebrated as the &quot;Day of National Currency of Republic of Kazakhstan&quot;. In 1995 a tenge-printing factory opened in Kazakhstan. The first consignment of tenge banknotes were printed in the United Kingdom and the first coins were struck in Germany. In February 2019, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev signed a bill into law that would remove all Russian captions from future tenge banknotes and coins.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;tenge&quot; in Kazakh and in most other Turkic languages means a set of scales (&quot;cf&quot; the old Uzbek &quot;tenga&quot; or the Tajik borrowed term &quot;tanga&quot;). The origin of the word is the Mongolic word &quot;teng&quot; (ᠲᠡᠩ) originating from Chinese &quot;děng&quot; (等 or 戥) which means &quot;being equal, balance&quot;. The name of this currency is thus similar to the pound, lira, peso, taka, and shekel. The name of the currency is also related to the Russian word for money / , which the Old Russian language borrowed from Turkic sources.

===Symbol===

Originally a simple letter &quot;Т&quot; was used to denote amounts in tenge, this is still recommended when the tenge symbol is not available. In autumn 2006 the National Bank of Kazakhstan organised a competition for a unique symbol for the currency and received over 30,000 applications.
On 20 March 2007, two days before the Nauryz holiday, the National Bank of Kazakhstan approved a graphical symbol for the tenge: ₸. 
On 29 March 2007, the Bank announced two designers from Almaty, Vadim Davydenko and Sanzhar Amirkhanov, as winners for the design of the symbol of the Kazakhstani tenge. They shared a prize of ₸1,000,000 and the title of &quot;parents&quot; of the tenge symbol.
The character was included in Unicode 5.2.0 (August 2009) at code point U+20B8.

== Coins ==
While older coins were struck in Germany, current coins are struck domestically, by the Kazakhstan Mint in Oskemen.

===First series (1993)===
In 1993, the first series of coins were introduced in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 tiyin featuring the national arms and were struck in bronze. The coins of ₸ 1, ₸ 3, ₸ 5, ₸ 10, and ₸ 20 were struck in cupro-nickel and depicted stylized and mythical animals. The coins of this period circulated alongside tiyin and low denomination tenge notes of equal value. Tiyin coins were withdrawn as of 7 February 2001 and lost their effect as legal currency as of 31 December 2012.

===Second series (1998)===

In 1998, a new series of coins was introduced. After the withdrawal of tiyin denominated coins ₸ 1 became the smallest denomination. ₸ 100 were later introduced in 2002 replacing the equivalent notes. A ₸ 2 coin was introduced in 2005. In 2013 the alloy of lower denomination coins was altered.

===Third series (2019)===
In 2019, a new series of coins was introduced into circulation, with the same coin specifications and metallic compositions as the second series. But with the inscriptions of the coins now rendered in Latin-based Kazakh instead of Kazakh-based Cyrillic.

The coins were issued as part of the efforts of the presidential decree issued by former President Nursultan Nazarbayev of its transition of switching from a Cyrillic-based alphabet to a Latin-based alphabet and emphasizing Kazakh culture and distance the country from Russian influence. The designs of the coins were approved by Interim President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on 20 March 2019. Previously issued coins bearing the Kazakh Cyrillic script will remain legal tender alongside the new Kazakh Latin inscribed coins. 
In 2019, the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced the issuance of new ₸200 coins, which were issued into circulation in 2020. This new denomination features inscriptions in Latin-based Kazakh, and like the ₸100 coin, is bi-metallic.

===Commemorative coins===
Commemorative coins are issued in denominations of ₸20, ₸50, ₸100, ₸500, ₸1,000, ₸2,500, ₸5,000 and ₸10,000. Silver and gold bullion coins exist in denominations of ₸1, ₸2, ₸5, ₸10, ₸20, ₸50 and ₸100. Many of the ₸20 and ₸50 commemoratives are also struck in cupro-nickel and occasionally make it out into general circulation as a side coinage with face value.

== Banknotes ==
===1993 series===

On 15 November 1993, the National Bank of Kazakhstan issued notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 tiyn, T 1, T 3, T 5, T 10, T 20, and T 50; T 100 notes followed shortly thereafter. These were followed in 1994 by T 200, T 500, and T 1,000 notes. T 2,000 notes were introduced in 1996, with T 5,000 in 1999 and T 10,000 on 28 July 2003. Notes currently in circulation are:

*₸200 - portrait of Al-Farabi
*₸500 - portrait of Al-Farabi, fragment of Khodzha Akhmet Yassaui mausoleum
*₸1,000 - portrait of Al-Farabi
*₸2,000 - portrait of Al-Farabi
*₸5,000 - portrait of Al-Farabi
*₸10,000 - portrait of Al-Farabi, image of snow leopard.


=== 2006 series ===

The National Bank of Kazakhstan issued a new series of tenge banknotes in 2006. This was not a currency reform as they replaced existing notes at face value.

The 2006 series is far more exotic than its predecessors. The obverse is vertical and the denomination is written in Kazakh. All denominations depict the Bayterek monument, the flag of Kazakhstan, the Coat of arms, the handprint with a signature of president Nursultan Nazarbayev and fragments of the national anthem. The main differences across each denomination are only the colours, denominations and underprint patterns.

On the contrast, the reverse side of the notes are more different. The denomination is written in Russian, and each denomination shows a unique building and geography of Kazakhstan in the outline of its borders.

The first printing of the ₸2,000 and ₸5,000 notes issued in 2006 had misspellings of the word for &quot;bank&quot; (the correct spelling &quot;&quot; &quot;bankı&quot; was misspelled &quot;*&quot; &quot;banqı&quot;). The misspelling was a politically sensitive issue due to the cultural and political importance of the Kazakh language.

On 3 October 2016, the ₸2,000, ₸5,000 and ₸10,000 banknotes of the 2006 series lost their legal tender status and are no longer valid. From 4 October 2016 to 3 October 2017, these notes could be exchanged without commission at any second tier bank and branches of the National Bank of Kazakhstan.


===2011–2017 series===
The National Bank of Kazakhstan issued a new series of tenge banknotes dated 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 in denominations of ₸1,000, ₸2,000, ₸5,000, and ₸10,000. The designs for this series feature the &quot;Kazakh Eli&quot; monument on the front of the notes. On 1 December 2015, a new ₸20,000 banknote was introduced. It contains the issue date of 2013, and is a commemorative note to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the introduction of its national currency, but was not issued until 2015. In 2017, the National Bank of Kazakhstan issued a ₸500 banknote as part of this series, but has caused controversy over an image of a gull on the reverse side of the note and the image of the &quot;Moscow&quot; business center in Kazakhstan&#x27;s capital of Astana.

===2023-2025 series===
The National Bank of Kazakhstan announced a new series of banknotes set for issue from 2023 to 2025. Named &quot;Saka&quot;, the series will introduce notes issued in a reduced size, drop the Russian language, and incorporate many new security features for all six denominations. Banknotes of the previous series will cease to be legal tender after the release of each denomination, and will be redeemable at banks and post offices for up to three years. The National Bank of Kazakhstan will redeem all previous issues without limit.

===Commemorative banknotes===
Since 2008, a number of commemorative designs have been issued, including notes celebrating the 2011 Asian Winter Games hosted in Astana. Commemoratives can typically be found in these denominations: ₸1,000, ₸2,000, ₸5,000, and ₸10,000.

==Digital tenge==
The National Bank of Kazakhstan publicly released plans to develop a national digital currency.

==Commemorative banknotes==
*T 5,000 (2001)

*₸5,000 (2008)

*₸1,000 (2010)

*₸1,000 (2011)

*₸2,000 (2011)

*₸10,000 (2011)

*₸1,000 (2013)
1,000 tenge banknote issued in 2013 to commemorate the &quot;Kul Tigin&quot; – the monument of the Turkic runic writing.

*₸10,000 (2016)
The National Bank of Kazakhstan issued a 10,000 tenge commemorative banknote to commemorate the 25th anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union. The commemorative note contains an image of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and was launched into circulation on the Day of the First President, 1 December 2016.

*₸20,000 (2021)
The National Bank of Kazakhstan issued a 20,000 tenge commemorative banknote to commemorate the 30th anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union. The commemorative note features images of the first president of Kazakhstan, &quot;Elbasy&quot; Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Akorda Presidential Palace, a view of the capital city of Astana and the official logo for the celebrations. The commemorative note is also the first to feature inscriptions in Kazakh-based Latin instead of Kazakh-based Cyrillic. The commemorative note was issued on 16 December 2021.

==Exchange rates and inflation==
On 2 September 2013, the National Bank of Kazakhstan moved the tenge from a managed float and pegged it to the US dollar and the Russian ruble.

On 11 February 2014, the Kazakh National Bank chose to devalue the tenge by 19% against the U.S. dollar in response to a weakening of the Russian ruble.

On 20 August 2015, the Kazakhstan National Bank did away with the currency band with respect to conversion rate of tenge. Now, the tenge is a free-floating currency and its exchange rate against the major currencies are determined by demand and supply in the market. Due to this change, the tenge lost 30% of its value in a single day.

<doc id="246131" wikidata="Q859048" url="?curid=246131" title="Catharus">
<text>The genus Catharus is an evolutionary clade of forest-dwelling passerine birds in the family Turdidae (thrushes), commonly known as nightingale-thrushes. The extant species are widely distributed across the Americas and are descended from a common ancestor that lived 4–6 million years ago. Most of the species are shy of humans, seldom leaving the cover of dense forest vegetation, where their activities are hidden from view. Thus, many fundamental aspects of their biology and life histories are poorly known.

Nightingale-thrushes are small omnivorous songbirds that, like their sister species the wood thrush (&quot;Hylocichla mustelina&quot;), exhibit a variety of migratory and non-migratory habits. Multiple species are long-distance migrants that breed in North America and &quot;winter&quot; in the Neotropics. The breeding range of one migratory species, the gray-cheeked thrush (&quot;C. minimus&quot;), extends into eastern Siberia. The remainder of the migratory species are restricted to the Americas, notwithstanding occasional vagrant records in Europe and northeast Asia. The non-migratory species are residents of the Neotropical realm.

==Systematics==
Historically, the migratory and residents were placed in two genera: &quot;Hylocichla&quot; and &quot;Catharus&quot;, respectively. However, molecular studies indicate that hermit thrush (&quot;C. guttatus&quot;) is more closely related to three Neotropical species (&quot;C. occidentalis&quot;, &quot;C. gracilirostris&quot;, &quot;C. frantzii&quot;) than to the long-distance migrants which it superficially resembles. This pattern of homoplasy may be the result of two independent origins of migration in the genus, and the convergent evolution of phenotypic characters associated with migration.

The taxonomy of &quot;Catharus&quot; dates to the 18th century and has a confusing history resulting from multiple cryptic species, taxonomic composites, misidentified species, and other historical errors. The name &quot;Catharus&quot;, authored by Charles Lucien Bonaparte, is derived from the Ancient Greek () meaning &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;clean&quot;, and refers to the plumage of the orange-billed nightingale-thrush (&quot;C. aurantiirostris&quot;).

Species delimitation in &quot;Catharus&quot; remains an active topic of study and multiple taxonomic splits have been proposed and/or adopted during the last half century, to recognize long-overlooked cryptic species. For example, evidence supporting the split of &quot;C. frantzii&quot; and &quot;C. occidentalis&quot; was published in 1969; evidence supporting the split of &quot;C. bicknelli&quot; and &quot;C. minimus&quot; was published in 1993; most recently, evidence supporting the split of &quot;C. dryas&quot; and &quot;C. maculatus&quot; was published in 2017. The sister taxa &quot;C. ustulatus&quot; and &quot;C. swainsoni&quot; have also been treated at species rank by some authors.

The nightingale-thrushes, revered for their beautiful songs, have long been compared to the common nightingale (&quot;Luscinia megarhynchos&quot;). Theodore Roosevelt once remarked that, &quot;In melody, and above all in that finer, higher melody where the chords vibrate with the touch of eternal sorrow, [&quot;L. megarhynchos&quot;] cannot rank with such singers as the Wood Thrush and Hermit Thrush. The serene, ethereal beauty of the Hermit&#x27;s song, rising and falling through the still evening under the archways of hoary mountain forests that have endured from time everlasting&quot;. A study published in 2014 presented evidence that hermit thrush songs, like human music, tend to be constructed of frequency ratios that are expressed as simple mathematical ratios and follow the harmonic series.

<doc id="246137" wikidata="Q28846021" url="?curid=246137" title="Aldgate">
<text>Aldgate () was a gate in the former defensive wall around the City of London. 

The gate gave its name to &quot;Aldgate High Street&quot;, the first stretch of the A11 road, that takes that name as it passes through the ancient, extramural Portsoken Ward of the City of London. 

There is an ancient &quot;Aldgate Ward&quot; inside the line of the former gate and wall, and a similarly ancient Portsoken Ward that lies just outside of it. However the use of the Aldgate and Portsoken Wards as everyday place names is very limited. 

Consequently, the use of Aldgate as a place name is informal, and typically applies to the Portsoken Ward, especially the central area around Aldgate High Street.

Aldgate High Street is 2.3 miles (3.7 km) east of Charing Cross.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the name &quot;Aldgate&quot; is uncertain. It is first recorded in 1052 as &quot;Æst geat&quot; (&quot;east gate&quot;) but had become &quot;Alegate&quot; by 1108. Writing in the 16th century, John Stow derived the name from &quot;Old Gate&quot; (Aeld Gate). However, Henry Harben, writing in 1918, contended that this was wrong and that documents show that the &quot;d&quot; is missing in documents written before 1486–87. Alternative meanings include &quot;Ale Gate&quot; in connection with a putative ale-house or &quot;All Gate&quot; meaning the gate was free to all. Other possibilities canvassed by Harben include reference to a Saxon named &quot;Ealh,&quot; or reference to foreigners (&quot;el&quot;) or oil (&quot;ele&quot;) or &quot;awl&quot;. Gillian Bebbington, writing in 1972, suggests Alegate, Aelgate (&quot;public gate&quot;) or Aeldgate (&quot;Old Gate&quot;) as equally viable alternatives, while Weinreb and Hibbert, writing in 1983, revert to Stow&#x27;s theory that the name means &quot;Old Gate&quot;.

==The gate==
It is thought that a gate at Aldgate spanned the road to Colchester in the Roman period, when London Wall was constructed. The gateway – which probably had two circular towers – stood at the corner of the modern Duke&#x27;s Place, on the east side of the city, with a busy thoroughfare passing through it. 

The gate was rebuilt between 1108 and 1147, again in 1215, and reconstructed completely between 1607 and 1609 &quot;in a more classical and less functional style&quot;. Like London&#x27;s other gates, Aldgate was &quot;fortified with porticullises and chained&quot; in 1377 due to concerns about potential attacks by the French. 

Aldgate&#x27;s defensive functions are known to have been tested twice. Firstly during the Great Rising in the summer of 1381 when thousands of insurgents from the surrounding region, assisted by sympathisers within and without, entered the City through Aldgate, unopposed. The second breach was during the Siege of London, in the spring of 1471, when troops led by the Bastard of Fauconberg forced the gate, but were penned in and defeated in the small open space inside the gate. 
It has been argued that Aldgate&#x27;s defenders deliberately allowed the vanguard of Fauconberg&#x27;s men to through the gate in order that the portcullis could be lowered behind them; allowing the defenders to trap and defeat in detail that proportion of the attackers.

While he was a customs official, from 1374 until 1386 - including the period of the Great Rising, Geoffrey Chaucer occupied apartments above the gate, where he wrote some of his poems. London&#x27;s aldermen had first conceived of renting unneeded space over the City gates earlier in the century. Although keenly sought after due to their location, the rooms &quot;were built for military occupancy and remained rough-hewn [and] nonprivate&quot;. Chaucer likely occupied the single tower on the south end of the gate. A 1585 sketch of Aldgate&#x27;s north tower reveals an interior room of approximately ; its southern sibling probably had similar dimensions. The space would have been &quot;cramped, cold, rudimentary in its sanitary arrangements, and (perhaps most seriously in the case of a writer) ill lit, even at midday&quot;.
In his &quot;Survey of London&quot; (1598), John Stow wrote that Aldgate &quot;hath had two pair of gates, though now but one; the hooks remaineth yet. Also there hath been two portcullisses; the one of them remaineth, the other wanteth, but the place of letting down is manifest&quot;.

The gate was removed in 1761 in order to improve traffic flow. The historical and cultural significance of the gate led local antiquarian Ebenezer Mussell to buy the gates stones (or some of them) and also the reliefs. The materials were used to extend his home at Bethnal Green. The reliefs were prominently displayed and the house renamed &quot;Aldgate House&quot;. The house was in turn cleared to make way for development between 1807 and 1811. The site, on what is now known as Victoria Park Square has since been redeveloped again, and is now the site of the &#x27;Church of our Lady of the Assumption&#x27;.
==Aldgate locality==
===Geography===
The originally Roman A11 Road, once known as the &quot;Great Essex Road&quot;, is known as Aldgate High Street as it passes through the Portsoken Ward, and the use of Aldgate as a place name typically applies to this extramural area around Aldgate High Street. The High Street is around 290 metres (950 feet) long. Due to the road geography, and its historic interest, the Aldgate Pump, a few metres inside the position of the former gate is also usually included.

Immediately east of Aldgate High Street the road becomes known as Whitechapel High Street as it enters the Whitechapel area of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The stretch of Whitechapel High Street extending as far as Gardiners Corner, and including Aldgate East tube station is also occasionally referred to as part of Aldgate.

===History===
The church of St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate stands just outside the position of the former gate, and was in place by 1115, though some traditions suggest an earlier origin.

In about 1420 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry was founded in Aldgate, but it later moved to nearby Whitechapel. The foundry continued to supply bells to churches in the city, including the rebuilt church of St Botolph without Aldgate in 1744.

During the late 16th-century, an immigrant from Antwerp named Jacob Jansen (d. 1593) established a pottery producing English Delftware at Aldgate.

A Jewish community developed in the area after Oliver Cromwell invited the Jews to return to England. They established London&#x27;s oldest synagogue at Bevis Marks in 1698,

In 1773 &quot;Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral&quot; by Phillis Wheatley, the first book by an African American was published in Aldgate after her owners could not find a publisher in Boston, Massachusetts.

Daniel Mendoza was born in 1764 to a Jewish family in Aldgate. He was author of &quot;The Art of Boxing&quot; and became an English boxing champion from 1792 to 1795.

===Aldgate Pump===

From 1700 distances into Essex and Middlesex were measured from Aldgate Pump. The original pump was taken down in 1876, and a &quot;faux&quot; pump and drinking fountain was erected several yards to the west of the original; it was supplied by water from the New River.

In ancient deeds, &quot;Alegate Well&quot; is mentioned, adjoining the City wall, and this may have been the source (of water) for the original pump. A section of the remains of Holy Trinity Priory can be seen through a window in a nearby office block, on the north side.

===Aldgate Square===

In the 1970s, the historic street pattern in central Aldgate was altered to form one large traffic gyratory at the junction which included Whitechapel High Street and Commercial Road. This was followed by office development on the traffic island at the centre, and a network of underground subways was constructed to provide pedestrian access beneath the one-way system and to provide a link to the London Underground stations. This led to parts of Aldgate being protected in the Whitechapel High Street Conservation Area and there are numerous listed buildings.

Aldgate Square, a new public square sited between two heritage listed buildings, The Aldgate School and the church of St Botolph without Aldgate, was opened on 15 June 2018 by the Lord Mayor of the City of London. The cafe on the square, Portsoken Pavilion (named after the extramural Portsoken ward), was designed by Make, architects of the award-winning Visitor Information Centre at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

The alignment of the former London Wall, and with it the start of the East End of London, is prominently marked by a course of paving on the western side of the square.

===Public artworks===
Notable sculptures in Aldgate are the bronze abstract &quot;Ridirich&quot; (1980) by Keith McCarter in the Square between Little Somerset Street and the bus garage on Aldgate High Street; &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1985) outside the church of St Botolph without Aldgate made of fibreglass by Naomi Blake; &quot;Column&quot; (1995) cast in bronze by Richard Perry marking the entrance to Petticoat Lane Market at the southern end of Middlesex Street; and six hurtling bronze horses (2015) by Hamish Mackie in the piazza at Goodman&#x27;s Fields.

===Archaeological finds===
In 2013 in Minories, Aldgate – on the last day of excavations – archaeologists found a 1,900-year-old Roman sculpture from the late 1st or early 2nd century AD in what was Roman London&#x27;s &quot;Eastern Cemetery&quot;. &quot;The Minories Eagle&quot;, hailed by experts as one of the rarest and finest artefacts ever unearthed in Britain would have stood in a niche in a mausoleum above the tomb of a very powerful and wealthy man. Carved in Cotswold oolitic stone and rich in iconography it shows an exquisitely carved and outstandingly preserved eagle with a serpent in its beak. It was exhibited at the Museum of London in October 2013.

==Ward of Aldgate==
Aldgate is one of 25 wards in the City of London, each electing an Alderman to the Court of Aldermen and Commoners (the City equivalent of a councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City are eligible to stand.

The Wards of London appear to have taken shape in the 11th century, before the Norman Conquest. Their administrative, judicial and military purpose made them equivalent to Hundreds in the countryside. The primary purpose of Wards like Aldgate, which included a gate, appears to be the defence of the gate, as gates were the weakest points in any fortification.


The historic City ward is bounded on the east by the line of the former London Wall, effectively parallel with Houndsditch, which separates it from the Portsoken ward.

Since major boundary changes in 2013, the ward is now bounded by White Kennet Street in the north and Crutched Friars in the south, taking in Leadenhall and Fenchurch Streets. It therefore now includes a small area outside the line of the former walls. 
The Augustinians priory of Holy Trinity Aldgate was founded by Matilda, the wife of King Henry I, in 1108, on ground just inside the gate.

Within Aldgate ward, a short distance to the north of the gate, Jews settled from 1181, until their expulsion in 1290 by King Edward I. The area became known as Old Jewry. Jews were welcomed back by Oliver Cromwell, and once again they settled in the area, founding London&#x27;s oldest synagogue at Bevis Marks in 1698.

On 10 April 1992 the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb close to the Baltic Exchange, severely damaging the historic building and neighbouring structures. 30 St Mary Axe (formerly the Swiss Re Building) now occupies the site, and the Baltic Exchange is located at 38 St Mary Axe.

The ward today is dominated by the insurance industry, with several brokers and underwriters based there; prominent buildings include the Lloyd&#x27;s Register building, 30 St Mary Axe, the Willis Building and the London Metal Exchange.

Three churches are located in Aldgate ward: St. Botolph&#x27;s, St Katharine Cree (1631) and St Andrew Undershaft (1532) – administered from St. Helen&#x27;s in Lime Street ward.

The Bevis Marks Synagogue (1699), the oldest in the United Kingdom, is also located in the ward, on Bevis Marks. John Cass&#x27;s school, where a plaque records the former course of London Wall, is sited on the north side of Aldgate (the street).

==Transport==
The nearest London Underground station is Aldgate on the Circle and Metropolitan lines; nearby is served today by the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. Nearby mainline railway stations are located at Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street, and Tower Gateway is the closest Docklands Light Railway station.

<doc id="246142" wikidata="Q16993728" url="?curid=246142" title="J. R. Hartley">
<text>J. R. Hartley is a fictional character in a popular advertisement created by the agency Abbott Mead Vickers for the British Yellow Pages, first shown in 1983 when British Telecom was privatised.

==Plot==
The advertisement shows an elderly gentleman (played by Norman Lumsden) asking in several second hand bookshops for &quot;&quot;Fly Fishing&quot; by J. R. Hartley&quot;. No bookshop has it, and he goes home dejected. His daughter, sympathising, hands him the Yellow Pages; and one of the shops he phones has a copy. He is delighted and asks them to keep it for him. The unheard questioner asks for his name and he responds at dictation speed: &#x27;My name? Oh, yes, it&#x27;s J. R. Hartley.&#x27; The advertisement ends by promoting the Yellow Pages, the voiceover provided by actor Joss Ackland.

==Reception==
In 2015, a poll was carried out to mark the 60th anniversary of the first British television advertisement break. This advertisement was rated fifth most popular with 7% of the vote.

==Legacy==
Author Michael Russell wrote and published a spoof called &quot;Fly Fishing: Memories of Angling Days, by J. R. Hartley&quot; in 1991. The book was a best seller and led to two additional best sellers under the pseudonym J. R. Hartley: &quot;J.R. Hartley Casts Again – More Memories of Angling Days&quot; (1992) and &quot;Golfing by J. Hartley&quot; (1995). When Lumsden died on 28 November 2001 at the age of 95, the advertisement was broadcast again in his memory, nearly 20 years after its first appearance. In February 2011, Yellow Pages re-made the advertisement, with fictional DJ Day V. Lately searching for a copy of his trance remix &quot;Pulse and Thunder&quot;, which was released for sale at the same time.

In a nod to the original advert, Yellow Pages&#x27; online site Yell.com hold an annual award ceremony for their employees, the awards are called &quot;The Yell Hartley Awards&quot;

<text>The rock thrushes, Monticola, are a genus of chats, medium-sized mostly insectivorous or omnivorous songbirds. All are Old World birds, and most are associated with mountainous regions.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was erected by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie in 1822. &quot;Monticola&quot; is the Latin word for mountain-dweller or mountaineer. The genus was formerly included in the thrush family Turdidae. Molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2004 and 2010 showed that the species are more closely related to members of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.

The genus contains the following species:

<text>M. Witmark &amp; Sons was a leading publisher of sheet music for the United States &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; music industry.
The firm of Marcus Witmark &amp; Sons was established in New York City in 1886. The father, Marcus Witmark, was the legal head of the company; but from the beginning it was run by his sons Isidore, Julius, and Jay, who were under legal age when the company started (ranging in age from 17 to 14 years old). They started out publishing their own compositions. They were adept at &quot;plugging&quot; songs, and within a few years were publishing the works of such composers as Victor Herbert, George M. Cohan, Ben Harney, Pauline B. Story, and John Walter Bratton. 

Witmark originated the practice of giving free &quot;professional copies&quot; of their new music to famous and established singers and bands, which proved so successful an advertising method that it was copied by the rest of the music publishers.

When the International Copyright Law was passed in 1891, Witmark pioneered publishing versions of British music in the United States and arranging for American hits to be published in the UK.

== Family ==
== Succession of ownership ==
Tams-Witmark
: In 1922, Sargent Aborn (1867–1956), brother of Milton Aborn (1864–1933), both of the Aborn Opera Company, acquired the Arthur W. Tams (1848–1927) music library, a collection that had become the largest circulating music library in the world — and by extension, Witmark&#x27;s biggest competitor in the music-rental field. In January of 1925, M. Witmark &amp; Sons acquired the music Tams library, ending 30 years of intense rivalry. The combined Tams-Witmark library, operating as the Tam-Witmark Music Library Inc. (a New York corporation) secured its position as the largest source of musical-comedy and operatic music for amateur and professional productions. Sargent Aborn was president of Tams-Witmark from its founding until his death in 1957. In 1942, Sargent Aborn and his son, Louis Henry Aborn (1912–2005), acquired the rights to the Tams Library. As of 2014, the co-chairmen were Robert Aborn Hut (born 1935) and Sargent Louis Aborn (born 1948) and the executive vice-president was Peter Aborn Hut (born 1940). All three are grandchildren of Sargent Aborn. Tams-Witmark was acquired by Concord in 2018.

: In the 1960s, Tams-Witmark donated several lots of its old inventory to the special collections of five libraries known for music research: the Library of Congress, the Eastman School of Music, Westminster Choir College, and the largest part of its inventory to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, through the initiative of the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research and the School of Music.

: The consolidation of Tams and Witmark mostly affected operatic music and musical theatre. It did not affect the separate concern of M. Witmark &amp; Sons, music publishers, who continued publishing popular and classical music.

Warner Bros.
: In 1929, M. Witmark was purchased by Warner Bros. Warner Bros. merged its music publishing companies (which included Witmark, Remick, and Harms) into one company, Warner Bros. Music (now Warner/Chappell Music).

Alfred Music
: In 2005, Alfred Music purchased Warner Bros. Publications — acquiring the publishing rights to Warner/Chappell Music and the EMI Music Publishing Catalogue Partnership. Through this deal, Alfred Music gained the print rights of publishers that include M. Witmark &amp; Sons, Remick Music Corp., and T.B. Harms, Inc. Among the EMI holdings are the Robbins and Leo Feist catalogs, plus film music from United Artists, MGM, and 20th Century Fox.

<doc id="246155" wikidata="Q746718" url="?curid=246155" title="Birkenhead">
<text>Birkenhead () is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. The town is on the Wirral Peninsula, along the west bank of the River Mersey, opposite Liverpool. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Merseyside in 1974. At the 2021 census, the built up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics had a population of 109,835.

Birkenhead Priory and the Mersey Ferry were established in the 12th century. In the 19th century, Birkenhead expanded greatly as a consequence of the Industrial Revolution. Birkenhead Park and Hamilton Square were laid out as well as the first street tramway in Britain. The Mersey Railway connected Birkenhead and Liverpool with the world&#x27;s first tunnel beneath a tidal estuary; the shipbuilding firm Cammell Laird and a seaport were established.

In the second half of the 20th century, the town suffered a significant period of decline, with containerisation causing a reduction in port activity. The Wirral Waters development is planned to regenerate much of the dockland.

==Toponymy==
The name Birkenhead probably means &quot;headland overgrown with birch&quot;, from the Old English meaning birch tree, of which many once grew on the headland which jutted into the river at Woodside. The name is not derived from the Birket, a stream which enters the Mersey between Birkenhead and Seacombe. The Birket is a later name which was introduced by Ordnance Survey.

==History==
===Medieval period===

The earliest records state that the Mersey ferry began operating from Birkenhead in 1150, when Benedictine monks under the leadership of Hamon de Mascy built a priory there. The priory was visited in 1275 and 1277 by Edward I. In a royal charter of 13 April 1330, Edward III granted the priory further rights.

===19th century===
Distanced from the Industrial Revolution in Liverpool by the physical barrier of the River Mersey, Birkenhead retained its agricultural status until the advent of steam ferry services. In 1817 a steam ferry service started from Liverpool to Tranmere and in 1822 the paddle steamer, &quot;Royal Mail&quot;, began operation between Liverpool and Woodside.

Shipbuilding started in 1829. An ironworks was established by William Laird in 1824, and he was joined by his son John in 1828. The business eventually became the shipbuilder Cammell Laird. Notable naval vessels built at Birkenhead include HMS &quot;Achilles&quot;, , , , , , , the pioneer submarine , (which sank in Liverpool Bay during sea trials, and was refloated and commissioned as HMS &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, only to be lost to enemy action with the loss of the entire crew), and . Merchant vessels were also built such as and .

In 1833 an act was passed to introduce street paving, lighting and other improvements in the town. These included establishing a market and regulating the police force.

The Mersey Railway tunnel opened in 1886, providing direct railway access to Liverpool.

===20th century===
The Grange Road West drill hall was completed in 1900.

In September 1932 thousands of unemployed people protested in a series of demonstrations organised by the local branch of the National Unemployed Workers Movement. After three days of rioting, police were brought in from elsewhere to help quell the rioters.

In addition to the ferries and the railway, the Queensway road tunnel opened in 1934 and gave rapid access to Liverpool. This opened up the Wirral Peninsula for development, and prompted further growth of Birkenhead as an industrial centre. Bolstered by migration from rural Cheshire, southern Ireland and Wales, the town&#x27;s population had grown from 110 in 1801 to 110,912 one hundred years later and stood at 142,501 by 1951.

1989 saw the completion of a large shopping development within Birkenhead town centre, known as the Pyramids.

Conway Park station was opened in 1998 as part of a development that saw Wirral Metropolitan College open a new campus nearby.

===21st century===
The Wirral Waters development was announced in 2006, with work starting in 2011 and expecting to last for around 30 years.

Wirral Council announced in 2020 the formulation of a 20 year development plan known as the &#x27;Birkenhead 2040 Framework&#x27;. The plan aims to regenerate parts of Birkenhead, with the creation of a new park (Dock Branch Park), new housing and an improved greener environment.

==Governance==
Birkenhead lies within the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, with Wirral Council providing most local government functions. Wirral forms part of the Liverpool City Region, which is led by a directly elected Metro Mayor.

===Administrative history===
Birkenhead was historically a chapelry in the ancient parish of Bidston, which formed part of the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. For some purposes it was deemed an extra-parochial township. As the town began to develop rapidly in the early nineteenth century, there was a need for more urban forms of local government. The &#x27; (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. lxviii) set up a body of improvement commissioners covering the chapelry of Birkenhead. The commissioners&#x27; district was enlarged by the &#x27; (6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. xiii) to take in the township of Claughton with Grange and part of Oxton. Local government districts were subsequently established for Tranmere in 1860 and Oxton in 1863.

In 1877 Birkenhead was incorporated as a municipal borough, with its territory covering the combined area of the old commissioners&#x27; district and the two local government districts of Oxton and Tranmere, which were abolished. The new borough also took in the Rock Ferry area from Bebington. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Birkenhead was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough, making it independent from the new Cheshire County Council, whilst still being deemed part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes.

The council built itself Birkenhead Town Hall on Hamilton Square to serve as its headquarters; the building was opened in 1887. The borough was enlarged in 1928 to absorb Landican, Prenton and Thingwall, and again in 1933 to take in Bidston, Noctorum, Upton and Woodchurch.

The borough of Birkenhead was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and being transferred to the metropolitan county of Merseyside. In 1986 Merseyside County Council was abolished, with Wirral Council then taking on the county council&#x27;s former functions in the area. Since 2014 Wirral and the other Merseyside boroughs and neighbouring Halton have been covered by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which has been led by a directly elected mayor since 2017.

===Constituency===

The constituency of Birkenhead has elected Members of Parliament from the Labour Party since its creation in 1950 when Birkenhead East and Birkenhead West were abolished. However, in 2018 Frank Field resigned the Labour whip and served the rest of the term until 2019 as an independent MP. The town has been represented by Alison McGovern since 2024.

==Geography==
The Birkenhead Urban Area, as defined by the Office for National Statistics, includes Birkenhead, Wallasey, Bebington, Ellesmere Port (which is outside the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral) and the contiguous built-up areas which link those towns. In the 2011 Census, the area so defined had a total population of 325,264, making it the 19th largest conurbation in England and Wales.

==Economy==

===Shipbuilding===

Shipbuilding and ship repair has featured prominently in the local economy since the 19th century. Cammell Laird entered receivership in 2001. The shipyard was sold and became &#x27;Northwestern Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders&#x27; (NS&amp;S), which grew into a successful business specialising in ship repair and conversion, including maintenance contracts for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. In September 2007 NS&amp;S acquired the rights to use the Cammell Laird name. The company was renamed &#x27;Cammell Laird Shiprepairers &amp; Shipbuilders&#x27; on 17 November 2008, seeing the famous name return to Birkenhead after a seven-year hiatus. In 2010, Cammell Laird secured a £50 million contract to construct the flight deck for , the first of two s. In 2015, Cammell Laird was selected as the preferred bidder to construct , a Royal Research Ship.

===Commerce===
Birkenhead&#x27;s first market was established in 1835 in a purpose-built building in Hamilton Street near its junction with Market Street. This building also contained the town hall, commissioners&#x27; offices and a lock-up. It is often said that the first market was opened on the site of the later town hall in Hamilton Square. This is untrue. In fact, part of the eastern side of Hamilton Square was deliberately left empty until 1887, when the main town hall was built on that designated site. The Hamilton Square town hall site was never used as a market, despite that myth being propagated in many accounts of Birkenhead&#x27;s history, including official sources. The large market hall which was a famous feature of Birkenhead was built behind the original market, along Albion Street, opening in July 1845. This market hall was built by Fox, Henderson &amp; Co, who later built The Crystal Palace. 
Michael Marks, of Marks &amp; Spencer, opened one of his first seven &#x27;Penny Bazaar&#x27; stalls here during the 1880s. On 31 January 2018, Marks &amp; Spencer announced the closure of their store, in the town centre of Birkenhead, happening in April.

During the 1970s, the commercial centre of the town was redeveloped around the principal shopping area of Grange Road. Following two fires at the expanded Birkenhead Market in 1969 and 1974, it was moved to new premises adjoining the Grange Shopping Precinct development in 1977. Commercial expansion continued in the early 1990s when the Pyramids Shopping Centre was opened. The previous market site has been redeveloped with the construction of two office buildings, primarily to house Land Registry and Department for Work and Pensions offices.

===Economic statistics===
In February 2010, the town had an overall unemployment rate of 8.2% (males 12.4%, female 4.1%) as against a national average of 4.4%.

==Demography==
At the 2021 census, the built up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) had a population of 109,835.

For the previous 2011 census, the ONS identified a wider Birkenhead built up area with a population of 325,264, which comprised five built up area subdivisions called Bebington, Birkenhead (population 142,968), Ellesmere Port, Elton, and Wallasey. The Birkenhead subdivision based on the 2011 census was larger than the Birkenhead built up area based on the 2021 census; notable differences between those two definitions are that Greasby is classed as a separate urban area in 2021, and Moreton has been counted as part of the Wallasey built up area in 2021.

==Landmarks==
Birkenhead Park is acknowledged to be the first publicly funded park in Britain.
The park was the forerunner of the Parks Movement and its influence was far reaching both in Britain and abroad – most notably on Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s design for Central Park in New York City.
Designed by Joseph Paxton (later Sir Joseph Paxton) in 1843 and officially opened in 1847, with great festivity. The park&#x27;s Grand Entrance, modelled on the Temple of Illysus in Athens, and its &#x27;Roman Boathouse&#x27; are notable features. There are sandstone lodges at the three entrances, each with a different style of architecture, Gothic, Norman and Italianate. There are also two lakes and an ornate &#x27;Swiss Bridge&#x27;.

William Laird, a Scot, and his son John, were influential in the design of the town. Parts were laid out in a grid-iron pattern like Edinburgh New Town with similar architecture. The chief architect was James Gillespie Graham from Edinburgh. This grid pattern was centred around Hamilton Square which was started in 1826 and, apart from Trafalgar Square in London, contains the most Grade I listed buildings in one place in England. including Birkenhead Town Hall. A short distance from Hamilton Square are two other notable landmarks: the Queensway Tunnel Main Entrance and the Woodside Ferry Terminal. The film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; had scenes shot at Woodside. These scenes were as a representation of Dover in the 1920s.

Other notable landmarks include Bidston Windmill on a ridge behind the town, Flaybrick Watertower and Birkenhead Priory &amp; St. Mary&#x27;s Tower.

==Transport==
===Buses===
Horse-drawn buses began operating in Birkenhead in 1848, to be replaced with motor vehicles after the First World War.

Present-day services are run by operators including Arriva and Stagecoach, which are coordinated by Merseytravel.

National Express provides long-distance coach services to other UK cities, with direct routes including London, Glasgow, Bangor and Newcastle.

====Bus station====

The bus station was opened in 1996. It is adjacent to The Grange shopping centre and Birkenhead Market.

It has a total of eleven stands and incorporates a travel centre. The main bus operators at the station include Arriva North West and Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire.

Services using the bus station operate around the town of Birkenhead, throughout the Wirral and to the nearby city of Liverpool via the Queensway Tunnel. The station also has frequent services to as far away as Chester.

===Railways===

The major underground station in Birkenhead is , the nearest station to the ferry terminal. Hamilton Square station is linked to the Liverpool Loop of the Wirral Line, which includes , , and stations; all of these are underground.

Railways reached Birkenhead in 1840, when the Chester and Birkenhead Railway began services. opened at the same time, becoming the town&#x27;s first terminus. opened in 1866, as the eastern terminus of the Hoylake Railway. With the opening of the Woodside and Birkenhead Dock Street Tramway in 1873, this station probably became the world&#x27;s first tram to train interchange. In 1886, Birkenhead and Liverpool were linked by an underground railway system, which today is part of the Merseyrail network.

From 1878 until its closure in 1967, was the town&#x27;s mainline railway terminus. Originally sited close to Woodside Ferry Terminal, the site had been redeveloped as part of Cammell Laird ship builders. Latterly, the adjacent dry dock at Cammell Laird was filled in and the area redeveloped to provide flats, a bus depot and offices for HM Land Registry and the Child Support Agency.

The town has one operational railway depot, Birkenhead North TMD; one disused, Birkenhead Central TMD; and two demolished, Birkenhead Mollington Street TMD and a further depot adjacent to Birkenhead Park station. The remains of the Birkenhead Dock Branch are still extant in a cutting through the centre of the town, which was used primarily for freight services. Much of the peripheral railway infrastructure, around the docks, has been removed since the 1980s.
===Former tramways===
Birkenhead had the first street tramway in Britain. Opened on 29 August 1860, the first line ran from Woodside (adjoining the terminal of the Mersey Ferry) to Birkenhead Park. This early system was horse-drawn and was the brainchild of flamboyant American, George Francis Train.
A preserved tram was on display in the Woodside ferry terminal booking hall.

The system was later electrified and operated from 1901 as Birkenhead Corporation Tramways; it closed in 1937. Two replica trams, imported from Hong Kong, have been brought into service as part of a heritage tramway between Woodside and Wirral Transport Museum; Birkenhead Corporation Tramways car No.20 is preserved on this line.

As part of the &quot;Wirral Waters&quot; development, a street car service has been proposed, to be called Wirral Street Car.

===Roads===
Junctions 1 and 3 of the M53 motorway facilitate access to the national motorway network. The A41 trunk road connects Woodside with Marble Arch in London. Two road tunnels, the Queensway road tunnel from Birkenhead and the Kingsway road tunnel from Wallasey, run underneath the River Mersey and connect the town to Liverpool.

===Maritime===
Birkenhead&#x27;s dock system is part of the Port of Liverpool, operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company under the ownership of The Peel Group. The Twelve Quays ferry terminal allows a direct freight and passenger vehicle service to Dublin and Belfast. Daily Belfast services are run by Stena Line, using their RoPax ferries and from 2020 to 2021, which replaced and . In 2024, a freight only service to Dublin commenced. The Mersey Ferry at Woodside operates a passenger service to Liverpool and chartered cruising.

During winter months, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company operates a service from Birkenhead to Douglas using . Due to weather conditions, this service temporarily replaces the route that normally operates from the Liverpool landing stage using fast craft.

Other nearby aviation facilities include Hawarden Airport and RAF Woodvale. Former airfields in the area include RAF Hooton Park and Bidston Aerodrome.

==Education==

===Schools===
Birkenhead has a number of maintained schools, including Birkenhead Park School (formed after the merger of Rock Ferry High School and Park High School) and the only all-boys Catholic grammar school in the area St. Anselm&#x27;s College.

Birkenhead also has two independently run schools. The oldest is Birkenhead School. It was exclusively a boys&#x27; school from its founding in 1860 until 2000, when its sixth form became co-educational. It became fully co-educational for pupils aged 3–18 in 2008. &quot;Old Birkonians&quot; (as former pupils are known) include the lawyer F.E. Smith (Lord Birkenhead); Andreas Whittam Smith (chairman of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) and founder of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper); mountaineer Andrew Irvine; Philip Toosey (hero at the Bridge on the River Kwai); and Tony Hall (former Director-General of the BBC).

Birkenhead High School Academy, formerly Birkenhead Girls High School, is an all-ability state funded girls&#x27; Academy. It was founded in 1885 and caters for girls aged 3–19. Its sponsor was the Girls&#x27; Day School Trust, but is now publicly funded. Its alumnae include the actress Patricia Routledge. Birkenhead Girls High School decided to become a state-funded Academy school in 2009, increasing the availability of its education. Like the change to co-education at Birkenhead School, this decision was largely driven by falling pupil numbers; however to this date, it remains a single-sex school.

Birkenhead Institute Grammar School existed from 1889 in Whetstone Lane, before being moved to Claughton in the 1970s. The school closed in 1994. The school&#x27;s alumni include Wilfred Owen.

===Colleges===
Previously situated at Borough Road, Birkenhead&#x27;s college has campuses at Europa Boulevard and Twelve Quays. The college was originally Birkenhead Technical College, and has been known as Wirral Metropolitan College since the 1980s. The college had a theatre on Borough Road named after one of its most famous former students, Glenda Jackson, the Oscar-winning actress and Member of Parliament, herself a Birkonian, born in 1936. The Borough Road campus and the Glenda Jackson Theatre were demolished in late 2005, to make way for flats, although Wirral Metropolitan College flourishes on other sites across Wirral. The theatre secretly housed an emergency command centre for the region in its basement, accessible via the college. Politicians and officials would have retreated to this secure bunker in the event of nuclear war to co-ordinate the recovery effort. By the 1990s, after the end of the Cold War, the bunker had been decommissioned and the surrounding complex of rooms was used by the college as a rehearsal space and recording studio.

Other colleges include the Birkenhead Sixth Form College, in the Claughton area of the town, formerly the site of Corpus Christi Catholic High School.

==Religion==

Religion in Birkenhead dates back to 1150 when Hamon de Masci founded Birkenhead Priory for the Benedictine order.

The current Anglican churches are St. James&#x27; Church, Christ Church and the Church of Christ the King which are all within the Diocese of Chester. Julie Conalty is the current suffragan Bishop of Birkenhead.

Roman Catholic churches include the Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception and St. Werburgh&#x27;s Church which are within the Diocese of Shrewsbury.

The other religious buildings include the Wirral Christian Centre of the Elim Pentecostal Church and the Islamic Shah Jalal Mosque. The Jewish Birkenhead Synagogue existed from 1890 and closed prior to 2006.

Flaybrick Memorial Gardens contains the town&#x27;s former main cemetery, which is situated near to St. James&#x27; Church. Flaybrick Hill Cemetery has been superseded by Landican Cemetery, opened in 1934.

==Healthcare==
Birkenhead is served by Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (through its Arrowe Park Hospital, St Catherine&#x27;s Health Centre and Clatterbridge Hospital sites) and Wirral Primary Care Trust. Formerly, Birkenhead was also served by Birkenhead General Hospital on Park Road North and St. James&#x27; Hospital in Claughton, now demolished and redeveloped for housing.

==Arts, sports and leisure==

===Arts===
The Laird School of Art was the first public school of art outside London and was given to the town by John Laird. It opened on 27 September 1871. The Williamson Art Gallery was opened in 1928 and houses a fine collection of paintings, porcelain and pottery.

In 1856, Birkenhead Library was opened as the country&#x27;s first public library in an unincorporated borough.
The library was situated in Hamilton Street until 1909, when it moved to a new building in Market Street South, near Birkenhead Market. In the 1930s, this building (along with much of the surrounding area) was demolished to make way for the entrance to the Queensway Tunnel. The present library, Birkenhead Central Library, is situated on Borough Road and was opened by King George V in 1934.

Despite being in England, Birkenhead (known as &quot;Penbedw&quot;, in Welsh) hosted Wales&#x27; National Eisteddfod in 1917 as well as an unofficial National Eisteddfod event in 1879. As in Liverpool, migrants from Wales, especially North Wales, contributed greatly to the growth of the town and its cultural development in the 19th century. The first local Birkenhead Eisteddfod, a precursor of the national events, took place in 1864. The 1917 National Eisteddfod was notable for the award of the chair to the poet Ellis Humphrey Evans, known as Hedd Wyn. The winner was announced, and the crowd waited for the winner to accept congratulations before the chairing ceremony, but no winner appeared. It was then announced that Hedd Wyn had been killed the previous month on the battlefield in Belgium, and the bardic chair was draped in black. These events were portrayed in the Academy Award nominated film &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot;, and were apparently intended as a protest against the war policies of Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who was present. There is a commemorative stone for the event in Birkenhead Park. The first meeting of the international Celtic Congress also took place at the Birkenhead Eisteddfod.

The Argyle Theatre was a major theatre and music hall which opened on 28 December 1868 and became notable for the calibre of artistes who appeared there. Later in its life, it was also used as a cinema. The theatre was destroyed by bombing in 1940.

The &quot;Theatre Royal&quot;, opened on 31 October 1864, was in Argyle Street and had a capacity of 1,850. This theatre was closed in 1919 and demolished in the 1930s. Another theatre, the &quot;Hippodrome&quot;, which was converted into a cinema in the 1930s, stood on the site of what became the Co-operative department store in Grange Road.

The Little Theatre was established in 1958 from a converted former Presbyterian church. The Pacific Road Arts Centre in Woodside opened in 1999, but in 2015 was converted to a &quot;Business Hub&quot;.

===Media===
Birkenhead is served by the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; local daily newspaper. The local weekly newspaper is the &quot;Wirral Globe&quot; and the online-only news website is &quot;Birkenhead News&quot;.

There are four local radio stations that transmit to Birkenhead: BBC Radio Merseyside, Hits Radio Liverpool, Greatest Hits Liverpool and Capital Liverpool.

Birkenhead is situated within the television regions of BBC North West and ITV&#x27;s Granada Television. The local television station Bay TV Liverpool also broadcasts to the area.

===Leisure===
As well as Birkenhead Park, other recreational open spaces in Birkenhead include Mersey Park and Victoria Park. Arrowe Park is a large area of parkland at the western edge of the town. In 1929, the 3rd World Scout Jamboree was held there.

The first two Boy Scout groups in the world are thought to have been founded as the 1st and 2nd Birkenhead groups at YMCA on the same night in 1908. The 2nd Birkenhead Scout Group is still operating and therefore is the longest running scout group in the world.

===Sport===

The first known football club on the Wirral was Birkenhead F.C. which was founded in 1879 by Robert E. Lythgoe, a former Druids F.C. player. An unrelated, disbanded side had played under the name Tranmere Rovers Cricket Club in 1881–82. Other clubs included Belmont Football Club, founded in 1884. They adopted the name Tranmere Rovers F.C. the following year, and are a professional team who play at Prenton Park near the Tranmere area of the town. They were a founder member of Division Three North in 1921, and were a member of The Football League until 2015, when they were relegated to the Conference, the fifth tier of English football. They returned to the Football League three seasons later, after a 2-1 play-off final win against Boreham Wood F.C. Cammell Laird 1907 F.C. is the town&#x27;s semi-professional football club who play at Kirklands in Rock Ferry. They play in the North West Counties League Division One.

The Birkenhead Park Football Club was founded in 1871, the same year as the Rugby Football Union. The club originally played in the Lower Park but moved to their current home in the Upper Park in 1885. Birkenhead Park also has its own cricket club.

Also in the town are the Birkenhead North End and Victoria Cycling Clubs. Olympic riders from the clubs include Chris Boardman, Mark Bell, Steve Cummings and Rachel Heal.

Birkenhead has been host to various rowing clubs since 1840. At present, Liverpool Victoria Rowing Club operates from a facility at the western end of West Float.

==Cultural references==
Birkenhead is indirectly referenced by &quot;the Birken&#x27;ead drill&quot; in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;Soldier an&#x27; Sailor Too&quot;: &quot;To take your chance in the thick of a rush, with firing all about, / Is nothing so bad when you&#x27;ve cover to &#x27;and, an&#x27; leave an&#x27; likin&#x27; to shout; / But to stand an&#x27; be still to the Birken&#x27;ead drill is a damn tough bullet to chew, / An&#x27; they done it, the Jollies – &#x27;Er Majesty&#x27;s Jollies – soldier an&#x27; sailor too!&quot;, as it refers to heroism by Royal Marines during the sinking of HMS Birkenhead, herself named after the town in which it was built. Other authors have done this as well.

Birkenhead is mentioned in the song &quot;What She Said&quot; on the album &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot; by the Smiths: &quot;What she read/All heady books/She&#x27;d sit and prophesise/(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead/To really really open her eyes).&quot; The town is also referred to in the song &quot;Everything Is Sorrow&quot; on the Boo Radleys&#x27; &quot;C&#x27;mon Kids&quot; album: &quot;I worked in Birkenhead for you/It brings me tears even now.&quot;

A fairly detailed description of the town is given in Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;At My Mother&#x27;s Knee... and Other Low Joints: The Autobiography&quot;.

The 1998 book, Awaydays, and the 2009 film of the same name are set in Birkenhead.

It has been suggested that Robert Louis Stevenson set his 1881 classic novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in the towns of Birkenhead and Wallasey and that the French science fiction writer Jules Verne set his 1874 novel &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; in Birkenhead.

<text>James Robert Cade (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, university professor, research scientist and inventor. Cade, a native of Texas, earned his bachelor and medical degrees at the University of Texas, and became a professor of medicine and nephrology at the University of Florida. Although Cade engaged in many areas of medical research, he is most widely remembered as the leader of the research team that created the sports drink Gatorade. Gatorade would have significant medical applications for treating dehydration in patients, and has generated over $150 million in royalties for the university.

In his later years, Cade became a prominent philanthropist, donating significant sums to charities affiliated with the Lutheran Church, creating scholarships and donating freely to the University of Florida and other colleges and universities, and endowing his own charitable foundations.

==Early life and education==

Robert Cade was born in San Antonio, Texas, on September 26, 1927. He was a fourth-generation Texan. Cade took an early interest in athletics and ran the mile in four minutes, twenty seconds at Brackenridge High School, a very respectable time for a high school athlete in the early 1940s. He graduated from Brackenridge High School in May 1945 and joined the U.S. Navy. He served for three years and was stationed at Naval Medical Research Unit Four in Dublin, Georgia (1 year), the destroyer USS &quot;Gherardi&quot; ( years) and the cruiser USS &quot;Rochester&quot;. He completed his service in September 1948 with the rank of pharmacist&#x27;s mate third class.

After being discharged from the navy, he enrolled in the University of Texas. He completed four years of undergraduate coursework in two calendar years, and graduated with his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1950. He was also a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity while at the University of Texas. In 1953, he married Mary Strasburger, a nurse from Dallas, Texas, whom he had met while he was in medical school. After graduating with his doctor of medicine degree from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas in 1954, Cade completed his internship at the Saint Louis City Hospital in Saint Louis, Missouri and did his residency at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. He also served fellowships at his alma mater, Southwestern Medical School, and Cornell University Medical College in New York City. In 1961, Cade joined the faculty of the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville, Florida, as an assistant professor of internal medicine in its renal division.

==Invention of Gatorade==

In 1965, Cade was approached by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade&#x27;s research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player&#x27;s plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.

During 1965 and 1966, Cade, together with his team of research doctors Dana Shires, James Free, and Alejandro M. de Quesada, conducted a series of trial-and-error experiments with his glucose-and-electrolytes rehydration drink on members of the Gators football team of coach Ray Graves, first with members of the freshman squad, and after initially promising results, with starting members of the varsity team. &quot;It didn&#x27;t taste like Gatorade,&quot; Cade said in a 1988 interview with &quot;Florida Trend&quot; magazine. In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman Larry Gagner first tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste. Dana Shires remembered that &quot;it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner.&quot; To make it more palatable, at the suggestion of Cade&#x27;s wife, the researchers added lemon juice and cyclamate to the original formula of water, salt, sodium citrate, fructose and monopotassium phosphate.

Cade appeared in &quot;The Legend of Gatorade&quot; television commercials narrated by long-time college football announcer Keith Jackson in 2005, during which Cade declared, &quot;Naturally, we called our stuff &quot;Gator&quot;ade.&quot; However, the rehydration drink was first known as &quot;Cade&#x27;s Ade&quot; and &quot;Cade&#x27;s Cola&quot; to the Florida Gators football team, and only later became known as &quot;Gatorade.&quot; The drink received its first real test in the Gators&#x27; 1965 game against the LSU Tigers football team; the Tigers faded in the heat of the second half and the Gators did not. Coach Graves was convinced, and asked Cade to produce enough of his potion for all Gator games. Gatorade achieved national prominence as a result of the Gators&#x27; first Orange Bowl title over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in January 1967. The Gators reinforced their reputation as a &quot;second-half team&quot; and came from behind to defeat the Yellow Jackets 27–10. Afterward, Georgia Tech head coach Bobby Dodd told reporters: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have Gatorade; that made the difference.&quot;

Cade patented the formula and offered all the rights to the drink to the University of Florida in exchange for the university&#x27;s backing of the production and marketing of the drink, but the university turned down his proposal. He initially obtained bank financing and began to produce &quot;Gatorade&quot; through his own business, but later entered into a contract with Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. to produce and sell the drink. When sales royalties reached $200,000, the university took notice. The Florida Board of Regents, prompted by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which had provided Cade with a small grant for his research, asked for the patent rights. Cade refused. The Board of Regents, acting on behalf of the university, then brought suit against Cade for a share of the profits, arguing that the university&#x27;s facilities, employees and students were instrumental in the development of the product. After thirty-one months of legal wrangling, Cade and the university negotiated a settlement of their dispute in 1972, and the Board of Regents and the university settled for a twenty percent share of the royalties. Cade, and his investors in the Gatorade Trust, retained eighty percent. In the aftermath of the settlement, Cade and the university resolved their differences amicably, and expanded their professional relationships—of the first $70,500 in Gatorade royalties received by the university, the university reinvested $999,999 in kidney research by Cade&#x27;s renal department and another $12,000 in Cade&#x27;s other research projects. Cade, for his part, created multiple scholarships and contributed generously to the university from his own royalties over the following years.

==Legacy==
Up to 2007, the University of Florida has received over $150 million from its share of the Gatorade royalties. As of 2015, this total has increased to $281 million. Cade and his associates&#x27; share of the royalties is undisclosed, the majority of their rights having been sold to Stokely-Van Camp. After the settlement, Cade continued to work for the university, and the college of medicine named him professor emeritus of nephrology upon his retirement in 2004. In April 2007, several months before his death, the University Athletic Association inducted Cade into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as an &quot;honorary letter winner.&quot;

Gatorade, now owned by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty countries and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent to make the first experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade&#x27;s use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade&#x27;s other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.

Cade was an active, lifelong member of the Lutheran church, and he was recognized by the church with its Wittenberg Award in 1991. He gave generously to many Lutheran colleges and organizations. In their later years, Cade and his wife established the Gloria Dei Foundation, an organization that makes grants to aid the &quot;poor and underserved.&quot;

Cade was a talented violinist who sometimes played with local symphony orchestras. Cade acquired collections of more than thirty violins and more than sixty vintage Studebaker automobiles. He and his wife continued to live in the same Gainesville house that they owned before the financial success of Gatorade. On November 27, 2007, Cade died of kidney failure, at the age of 80, in Gainesville. He was survived by his wife Mary, their six children, twenty grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

The Cade Museum Foundation, established in 2004 and chaired by Cade&#x27;s daughter, Phoebe Cade Miles, announced in 2010 that it had begun raising funds to construct a new building for the Cade Museum in Gainesville, with a groundbreaking planned for 2015. The museum opened in May 2018.

On September 26, 2013, Florida Governor Rick Scott posthumously honored Cade as a &quot;Great Floridian&quot; during a ceremony at the Cade Museum. The award honors those people who made &quot;major contributions to the progress and welfare&quot; of Florida.

<text>In mathematics, summation is the addition of a sequence of numbers, called &quot;addends&quot; or &quot;summands&quot;; the result is their &quot;sum&quot; or &quot;total&quot;. Beside numbers, other types of values can be summed as well: functions, vectors, matrices, polynomials and, in general, elements of any type of mathematical objects on which an operation denoted &quot;+&quot; is defined.

Summations of infinite sequences are called series. They involve the concept of limit, and are not considered in this article.

The summation of an explicit sequence is denoted as a succession of additions. For example, summation of is denoted , and results in 9, that is, . Because addition is associative and commutative, there is no need for parentheses, and the result is the same irrespective of the order of the summands. Summation of a sequence of only one summand results in the summand itself. Summation of an empty sequence (a sequence with no elements), by convention, results in 0.

Very often, the elements of a sequence are defined, through a regular pattern, as a function of their place in the sequence. For simple patterns, summation of long sequences may be represented with most summands replaced by ellipses. For example, summation of the first 100 natural numbers may be written as . Otherwise, summation is denoted by using Σ notation, where formula_1 is an enlarged capital Greek letter sigma. For example, the sum of the first natural numbers can be denoted as

:formula_2

For long summations, and summations of variable length (defined with ellipses or Σ notation), it is a common problem to find closed-form expressions for the result. For example,

:formula_3

Although such formulas do not always exist, many summation formulas have been discovered—with some of the most common and elementary ones being listed in the remainder of this article.

== Notation ==

=== Capital-sigma notation ===

Mathematical notation uses a symbol that compactly represents summation of many similar terms: the &quot;summation symbol&quot;, formula_1, an enlarged form of the upright capital Greek letter sigma. This is defined as
:formula_5
where is the index of summation; is an indexed variable representing each term of the sum; is the lower bound of summation, and is the upper bound of summation. The &quot;&quot; under the summation symbol means that the index starts out equal to . The index, , is incremented by one for each successive term, stopping when .

This is read as &quot;sum of , from to &quot;.

Here is an example showing the summation of squares:
:formula_6

In general, while any variable can be used as the index of summation (provided that no ambiguity is incurred), some of the most common ones include letters such as formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10; the latter is also often used for the upper bound of a summation.

Alternatively, index and bounds of summation are sometimes omitted from the definition of summation if the context is sufficiently clear. This applies particularly when the index runs from 1 to &quot;n&quot;. For example, one might write that:
:formula_11

Generalizations of this notation are often used, in which an arbitrary logical condition is supplied, and the sum is intended to be taken over all values satisfying the condition. For example:
:formula_12
is an alternative notation for formula_13 the sum of formula_14 over all (integers) formula_9 in the specified range. Similarly,
:formula_16
is the sum of formula_17 over all elements formula_18 in the set formula_19, and
:formula_20
is the sum of formula_21 over all positive integers formula_22 dividing formula_10.

There are also ways to generalize the use of many sigma signs. For example,
:formula_24
is the same as
:formula_25

A similar notation is used for the product of a sequence, where formula_26, an enlarged form of the Greek capital letter pi, is used instead of formula_27

===Special cases===
It is possible to sum fewer than 2 numbers:
* If the summation has one summand formula_18, then the evaluated sum is formula_18.
* If the summation has no summands, then the evaluated sum is zero, because zero is the identity for addition. This is known as the &quot;empty sum&quot;.

These degenerate cases are usually only used when the summation notation gives a degenerate result in a special case.
For example, if formula_30 in the definition above, then there is only one term in the sum; if formula_31, then there is none.

===Algebraic sum===
The phrase &#x27;algebraic sum&#x27; refers to a sum of terms which may have positive or negative signs. Terms with positive signs are added, while terms with negative signs are subtracted. e.g.
+1 -1

== Formal definition ==
Summation may be defined recursively as follows:
:formula_32, for formula_33;
:formula_34, for formula_35.

==Measure theory notation==
In the notation of measure and integration theory, a sum can be expressed as a definite integral,

:formula_36

where formula_37 is the subset of the integers from formula_38 to formula_39, and where formula_40 is the counting measure over the integers.

==Calculus of finite differences==

Given a function that is defined over the integers in the interval , the following equation holds:
:formula_41

This is known as a telescoping series and is the analogue of the fundamental theorem of calculus in calculus of finite differences, which states that:
:formula_42
where
:formula_43
is the derivative of .

An example of application of the above equation is the following: 
:formula_44
Using binomial theorem, this may be rewritten as: 
:formula_45

The above formula is more commonly used for inverting of the difference operator formula_46, defined by:
:formula_47
where is a function defined on the nonnegative integers.
Thus, given such a function , the problem is to compute the antidifference of , a function formula_48 such that formula_49. That is, formula_50
This function is defined up to the addition of a constant, and may be chosen as
:formula_51

There is not always a closed-form expression for such a summation, but Faulhaber&#x27;s formula provides a closed form in the case where formula_52 and, by linearity, for every polynomial function of .

==Approximation by definite integrals==
Many such approximations can be obtained by the following connection between sums and integrals, which holds for any increasing function &quot;f&quot;:

:formula_53

and for any decreasing function &quot;f&quot;:

:formula_54

For more general approximations, see the Euler–Maclaurin formula.

For summations in which the summand is given (or can be interpolated) by an integrable function of the index, the summation can be interpreted as a Riemann sum occurring in the definition of the corresponding definite integral. One can therefore expect that for instance

:formula_55

since the right-hand side is by definition the limit for formula_56 of the left-hand side. However, for a given summation &quot;n&quot; is fixed, and little can be said about the error in the above approximation without additional assumptions about &quot;f&quot;: it is clear that for wildly oscillating functions the Riemann sum can be arbitrarily far from the Riemann integral.

More generally, one has Faulhaber&#x27;s formula for formula_83
: formula_84
where formula_85 denotes a Bernoulli number, and formula_86 is a binomial coefficient.

=== Summation index in exponents ===
In the following summations, is assumed to be different from 1.

: formula_87 (sum of a geometric progression)
: formula_88 (special case for )
: formula_89 ( times the derivative with respect to of the geometric progression)
: formula_90
:::(sum of an arithmetico–geometric sequence)

=== Binomial coefficients and factorials ===
There exist very many summation identities involving binomial coefficients (a whole chapter of &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; is devoted to just the basic techniques). Some of the most basic ones are the following.

====Involving the binomial theorem====
: formula_91 the binomial theorem
: formula_92 the special case where 
: formula_93, the special case where , which, for formula_94 expresses the sum of the binomial distribution
: formula_95 the value at of the derivative with respect to of the binomial theorem
: formula_96 the value at of the antiderivative with respect to of the binomial theorem

==== Involving permutation numbers====
In the following summations, formula_97 is the number of -permutations of.
: formula_98
: formula_99
: formula_100, where and formula_101 denotes the floor function.

: formula_104
: formula_105
:formula_106
:formula_107

===Harmonic numbers===

: formula_108 (the th harmonic number)
: formula_109 (a generalized harmonic number)

==Growth rates==
The following are useful approximations (using theta notation):

: formula_110 for real &quot;c&quot; greater than −1
: formula_111 (See Harmonic number)
: formula_112 for real &quot;c&quot; greater than 1
: formula_113 for non-negative real &quot;c&quot;
: formula_114 for non-negative real &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;
: formula_115 for non-negative real &quot;b&quot; &gt; 1, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;

==History==

* In 1675, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg, suggests the symbol ∫ to mark the sum of differentials (Latin: &quot;calculus summatorius&quot;), hence the S-shape. The renaming of this symbol to &quot;integral&quot; arose later in exchanges with Johann Bernoulli.
* In 1755, the summation symbol Σ is attested in Leonhard Euler&#x27;s &quot;Institutiones calculi differentialis&quot;. Euler uses the symbol in expressions like:
: formula_116
* In 1772, usage of Σ and Σn is attested by Lagrange.
* In 1823, the capital letter &quot;S&quot; is attested as a summation symbol for series. This usage was apparently widespread.
* In 1829, the summation symbol Σ is attested by Fourier and C. G. J. Jacobi. Fourier&#x27;s use includes lower and upper bounds, for example:
: formula_117

<text>Ottava rima is a rhyming stanza form of Italian origin. Originally used for long poems on heroic themes, it later came to be popular in the writing of mock-heroic works. Its earliest known use is in the writings of Giovanni Boccaccio.

The ottava rima stanza in English consists of eight iambic lines, usually iambic pentameters. Each stanza consists of three alternate rhymes and one double rhyme, following the ABABABCC rhyme scheme. The form is similar to the older Sicilian octave, but evolved separately and is unrelated. The Sicilian octave is derived from the medieval strambotto and was a crucial step in the development of the sonnet, whereas the ottava rima is related to the canzone, a stanza form.

== History ==
=== Italian ===
Boccaccio used &quot;ottava rima&quot; for a number of minor poems and, most significantly, for two of his major works, the &quot;Teseide&quot; (1340) and the &quot;Filostrato&quot; (c. 1335). These two poems defined the form as the main one to be used for epic poetry in Italian for the next two centuries. For instance, &quot;ottava rima&quot; was used by Poliziano and by Boiardo in his 1486 epic poem &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;. The following year, Luigi Pulci published his &quot;Morgante Maggiore&quot; in which the mock-heroic, half-serious, half-burlesque use of the form that is most familiar to modern English-language readers first appeared. However, poets such as Ludovico Ariosto and Torquato Tasso continued to use &quot;ottava rima&quot; for serious epic poetry.
In the epoch of Baroque Giambattista Marino employed ottava rima in &quot;Adone&quot; (1623). Another important work was written by a woman, Lucrezia Marinella, the author of long epic poem &quot;L&#x27;Enrico, ovvero Bisanzio acquistato&quot; (&quot;Enrico, or, Byzantium Conquered&quot;), that was translated into English by Maria Galli Stampino. There are also many other examples of using the stanza. Many classic works were translated into ottava rima. It was later used in Italian libretti; perhaps the most famous example ends with the title of the comic opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (1789).

=== English ===
In English, ottava rima first appeared in Elizabethan translations of Tasso and Ariosto. The form also became popular for original works, such as Michael Drayton&#x27;s &quot;The Barons&#x27; Wars&quot;, Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;Troia Britannica&quot;, or Emilia Lanier&#x27;s &quot;Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum&quot;. William Browne&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&#x27;s Pastorals&quot; also contains passages in ottava rima. The first English poet to write mock-heroic ottava rima was John Hookham Frere, whose 1817-8 poem &quot;Prospectus and Specimen of an Intended National Work&quot; used the form to considerable effect. Lord Byron read Frere&#x27;s work and saw the potential of the form. He quickly produced &quot;Beppo&quot;, his first poem to use the form. Shortly after this, Byron began working on his &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1819–1824), probably the best-known English poem in &quot;ottava rima&quot;. Byron also used the form for &quot;The Vision of Judgment&quot; (1822). Shelley translated the Homeric Hymns into English in ottava rima. In the 20th century, William Butler Yeats used the form in several of his best later poems, including &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot; and &quot;Among School Children&quot;. So did Kenneth Koch for instance in his autobiographical poem &quot;Seasons on Earth&quot; of 1987. In America Emma Lazarus wrote the poem An Epistle that consists of thirty four ottava rimas. Earlier Richard Henry Wilde used the stanza in his long poem &quot;Hesperia&quot;.
In keeping with the &quot;mock-heroic&quot; tone, Kevin McAleer wrote his 2018 biography of actor Errol Flynn entirely in ottava rima.

From Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;

From Constance Naden&#x27;s &quot;A Modern Apostle&quot; (1887)
From Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;&quot;

From Emma Lazarus&#x27;s &quot;An Epistle&quot;

===Other languages ===
The Spanish poets Boscán, Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga and Lope de Vega all experimented with ottava rima at one time or another. It is also the meter of several medieval Yiddish epic poems, such as the Bovo-Bukh (1507–1508), which were adaptations of Italian epics.

In Russia, Pavel Katenin instigated a high-profile dispute on the proper way of translating Italian epics, which resulted in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s ottava rima poem &quot;The Little House in Kolomna&quot; (1830), which took its cue from Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Beppo&quot;. Pushkin&#x27;s poem opens with a lengthy tongue-in-cheek discussion of the merits of ottava rima.

In Germany (or other German-speaking countries) ottava rima occurred not so often as in Italy, but was used in long works. Paul Heyse, a Nobel Prize laureate for the year 1910, used it in his poems (&quot;Die Braut von Cypern&quot;). Rainer Maria Rilke, regarded as the greatest German language lyric poet of the 20th century, wrote &quot;Winterliche Stanzen&quot; in ABABABCC scheme.


Luís de Camões&#x27;s 16th-century epic &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;, the most important epic in the Portuguese language, is not only one of the longest poems written in ottava rima (it consists of 1,102 stanzas), but is recognized as one of the great epics of European literature.
Camões was not the only Portuguese poet to use ottava rima. Many Portuguese and Brazilian poets wrote great epic poems using the stanza, for example Gabriel Pereira de Castro (1571–1632): &quot;Ulisseia ou Lisboa Edificada&quot; (1636), Vasco Mouzinho de Quevedo (16th/17th century): &quot;Afonso Africano&quot;, Francisco de Sá de Meneses (1600–1664): &quot;Malaca Conquistada&quot; (1634), António de Sousa Macedo (1606–1682): &quot;Ulissipo&quot; (1640), Brás Garcia de Mascarenhas: &quot;Viriato Trágico&quot; and José de Santa Rita Durão (1722–1784): &quot;Caramuru&quot; (1781).

Ottava rima was very popular in the Polish literature of the 17th century, which was under strong influence of Italian poetry. The scheme ABABABCC was introduced into Polish poetry by Sebastian Grabowiecki and made widespread by Piotr Kochanowski, who translated &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; by Torquato Tasso. It was used by Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski, Wespazjan Kochowski, Samuel Twardowski and Wacław Potocki. During The Enlightenment bishop and poet Ignacy Krasicki wrote his mock-epics (&quot;Monachomachia&quot;, &quot;Antymonachomachia&quot; and &quot;Myszeida&quot;) in ottava rima. In the beginning of 19th century Dyzma Bończa-Tomaszewski attempted to write a national epic &quot;Jagiellonida&quot;. His work, however, is not longer remembered. Later Juliusz Słowacki, one of the greatest romantic poets, wrote two long poems, &quot;Beniowski&quot; and &quot;Król Duch&quot; (&quot;King Spirit&quot;), using the stanza. Another important attempt to write a modern epic poem in ottava rima was Maria Konopnicka&#x27;s &quot;Pan Balcer w Brazylii&quot; (&quot;Mr. Balcer in Brazil&quot;). Poems written in ottava rima are usually translated into Polish in the same form. Lately &quot;La Araucana&quot; by Alonso de Ercilla was translated in such a way by Czesław Ratka.

In Czech poetry, Jaroslav Vrchlický, generally considered to be the greatest poet of the second half of 19th century, used ottava rima several times, for example in short poem &quot;Odpověď&quot; (&quot;An Answer&quot;) that is composed of only two stanzas. Vrchlický was well trained in the use of the stanza as he translated Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (&quot;Roland Enraged&quot;) into Czech.

In Slovenian literature ottava rima was used by France Prešeren, the greatest romantic poet, sometimes, among others, in &quot;Krst pri Savici&quot; (The Baptism on the Savica), that is considered to be a national epic of Slovenian people. Prologue to the poem is written in terza rima.

In Danish literature ottava rima was used by Frederik Paludan-Müller and others. He used the stanza in his long poem, &quot;Adam Homo&quot;. The poet implemented the scheme freely and often used, for example, the sequence ABABBACC instead of ABABABCC.

In Swedish poetry ottava rima was used by Esaias Tegnér in his epic Frithiof&#x27;s Saga.

In Finnish literature ottava rima was used by Eino Leino in some parts of book &quot;Juhana Herttuan ja Catharina Jagellonican lauluja&quot; (&quot;Songs of Prince John and Catherine the Jagellonian&quot;).

<text>Rhyme royal (or rime royal) is a rhyming stanza form that was introduced to English poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer. The form enjoyed significant success in the fifteenth century and into the sixteenth century. It has had a more subdued but continuing influence on English verse in more recent centuries.

==Form==

The rhyme royal stanza consists of seven lines, usually in iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme is ABABBCC. In practice, the stanza can be constructed either as a tercet and two couplets (ABA BB CC) or a quatrain and a tercet (ABAB BCC). This allows for variety, especially when the form is used for longer narrative poems.

Thanks to the form&#x27;s spaciousness compared to quatrains, and the sense of conclusion offered by the couplet of new rhyme in the sixth and seventh lines, it is thought to have a cyclical, reflective quality.

==History==

===Introduction and success===

Chaucer first used the rhyme royal stanza in his long poems &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; and the &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot;, written in the later fourteenth century. He also used it for four of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;: the Man of Law&#x27;s Tale, the Prioress&#x27; Tale, the Clerk&#x27;s Tale, and the Second Nun&#x27;s Tale, and in a number of shorter lyrics. He may have adapted the form from a French ballade stanza or from the Italian &quot;ottava rima&quot;, with the omission of the fifth line. Chaucer&#x27;s contemporary and acquaintance John Gower used rhyme royal in &quot;In Praise of Peace&quot; and in one short part, the lover&#x27;s supplication, in &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;. In the fifteenth century, rhyme royal would go on to become a standard narrative form in later Middle English poetry alongside the rhyming couplet.

James I of Scotland used rhyme royal for his Chaucerian poem &quot;The Kingis Quair&quot;. The name of the stanza might derive from this royal use, though it has also been argued that the stanza name comes from the use of poetry for addresses to royalty in festivals and ceremonies. English and Scottish poets were greatly influenced by Chaucer in the century after his death and many made use of the form in at least some of their works. John Lydgate used the stanza for many of his occasional and love poems, and throughout his 36,000-line &quot;Fall of Princes&quot;. Rhyme royal was also chosen by poets such as Thomas Hoccleve, John Capgrave, George Ashby, and the anonymous author of &quot;The Flower and the Leaf&quot;. The Scottish poet Robert Henryson consistently used the stanza throughout his two longest works, the &quot;Morall Fabillis&quot; and &quot;Testament of Cresseid&quot;. A few fifteenth-century Middle English romances use the form: &quot;Generides&quot;, &quot;Amoryus and Cleopes&quot;, and the &quot;Romans of Partenay&quot;. Rhyme royal was employed in drama in the later fifteenth-century Digby &quot;Conversion of Saint Paul&quot;.

===Early-modern uses===

In the early sixteenth century rhyme royal continued to appear in the works of poets such as John Skelton (e.g. in &quot;The Bowge of Court&quot;), Stephen Hawes (&quot;Pastime of Pleasure&quot;), Thomas Sackville (in the &quot;Induction&quot; to &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot;), Alexander Barclay (&quot;The Ship of Fools&quot;), William Dunbar (&quot;The Thrissil and the Rois&quot;) and David Lyndsay (&quot;Squyer Meldrum&quot;). Sir Thomas Wyatt used it in his poem &quot;They flee from me that sometime did me seek&quot;. The seven-line stanza began to be used less often during the Elizabethan era, but it was still deployed by John Davies in his &quot;Orchestra&quot; and by William Shakespeare in &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;.

The later sixteenth-century poet Edmund Spenser wrote his &quot;Hymn of Heavenly Beauty&quot; using rhyme royal, but he also created his own Spenserian stanza, rhyming ABABBCBCC, partly by adapting rhyme royal. The Spenserian stanza varies from iambic pentameter in its final line, which is a line of iambic hexameter, or in other words an English alexandrine. In the seventeenth century, John Milton experimented by extending the seventh line of the rhyme royal stanza itself into an alexandrine in &quot;On the Death of a Fair Infant Dying of a Cough&quot; and for the introductory stanzas of &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot;. Like many stanzaic forms, rhyme royal fell out of fashion during the later seventeenth-century Restoration, and it has never been widely used since.

===Revivals===

In the eighteenth century, Thomas Chatterton used Milton&#x27;s modified rhyme royal stanza with a terminal alexandrine for some of his forged faux-Middle English poems, such as &quot;Elinoure and Juga&quot; and &quot;An Excelente Balade of Charitie&quot;. The Romantic writers William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, both figures who were influenced by Chatterton, adopted Milton&#x27;s modified rhyme royal stanza in some works, such as Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Resolution and Independence&quot; and Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Psyche&quot;.

In the later nineteenth century William Morris, strongly influenced by Chaucer, wrote many parts of &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot; with the related rhyme scheme ABABBCBCC. In the United States, Emma Lazarus wrote some short sections of her cycle poem &quot;Epochs&quot; in rhyme royal.

Notable twentieth-century poems in orthodox rhyme royal are W. H. Auden&#x27;s &quot;Letter to Lord Byron&quot; (as well as some of the stanzas in &quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot;), W. B. Yeats&#x27;s &quot;A Bronze Head&quot; and John Masefield&#x27;s &quot;Dauber&quot;.

==English examples==

===Iambic pentameter===

Each example below is from a different century. The first is from Chaucer who may have introduced the form into English. The second is from 15th-century Scotland where the Scottish Chaucerians widely cultivated it. The third is from Thomas Wyatt.

;14th century — Chaucer
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,
That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,
In lovinge, how his aventures fellen
Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye,
My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye,
Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte
Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryt 
&lt;/poem&gt;

;15th century — Henryson
(Describing the god Saturn hailing from an extremely cold realm)
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
His face fronsit, his lyre was lyke the leid,
His teith chatterit and cheverit with the chin,
His ene , how sonkin in his heid,
Out of his nois the meldrop fast can rin,
With lippis bla and cheikis leine and thin;
The ice-schoklis that fra his hair doun hang
Was wonder greit and as ane speir als lang. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

;16th century — Wyatt
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
They flee from me that sometime did me seek
With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
That now are wild and do not remember
That sometime they put themself in danger
To take bread at my hand; and now they range,
Busily seeking with a continual change. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

;19th century — Emma Lazarus
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
It comes not in such wise as she had deemed,
Else might she still have clung to her despair.
More tender, grateful than she could have dreamed,
Fond hands passed pitying over brows and hair,
And gentle words borne softly through the air,
Calming her weary sense and wildered mind,
By welcome, dear communion with her kind. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

;20th century – W. B. Yeats
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
Here at right of the entrance this bronze head,
Human, superhuman, a bird&#x27;s round eye,
Everything else withered and mummy-dead.
What great tomb-haunter sweeps the distant sky
(Something may linger there though all else die)
And finds there nothing to make its terror less
&quot;Hysterica passio&quot; of its own emptiness? 
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Other meters===

Although in English verse the rhyme royal stanza is overwhelmingly composed in iambic pentameter, occasionally other lines are employed. Thomas Wyatt used iambic dimeter in his &quot;Revocation&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
What should I say?
—Since Faith is dead,
And Truth away
From you is fled?
Should I be led
With doubleness?
Nay! nay! mistress. (1–7)
&lt;/poem&gt; 

Percy Bysshe Shelley in his poem &quot;On an Icicle that Clung to the Grass of a Grave&quot; used anapestic tetrameter instead of iambic pentameter: 
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Oh! take the pure gem to where southerly breezes,
Waft repose to some bosom as faithful as fair,
In which the warm current of love never freezes,
As it rises unmingled with selfishness there,
Which, untainted by pride, unpolluted by care,
Might dissolve the dim icedrop, might bid it arise,
Too pure for these regions, to gleam in the skies. (1–7)
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Other languages==

Outside English-speaking countries rhyme royal was never very popular. It was used in French poetry in the 15th century. Sometimes it occurred in Spanish and Portuguese poetry. Saint John of the Cross wrote the poem &quot;Coplas hechas sobre un éxtasis de harta contemplación&quot;. Portuguese playwright and poet Gil Vicente used rhyme royal scheme in his &quot;Villancete&quot; (in the English translation by Aubrey Fitz Gerald Aubertine, the rhyme scheme of the original text is altered):
The &quot;villancete&quot; is similar in form to the Italian &quot;ballata mezzana&quot; (used by Guido Cavalcanti) or to the Spanish glosa. It consists of three stanzas: the first is a short envoi, followed by two seven-line stanzas.

Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger used rhyme royal in one poem in his &quot;Nordens guder&quot;.

In Eastern Europe, rhyme royal is extremely rare. Polish poet Adam Asnyk used it in the poem &quot;Wśród przełomu&quot; (&quot;At the breakthrough&quot;). In Czech literature František Kvapil wrote the poem &quot;V hlubinách mraků&quot; (&quot;In Depths of Darkness&quot;) in rhyme royal.

<doc id="246168" wikidata="Q169341" url="?curid=246168" title="Walter Donaldson (songwriter)">
<text>Walter Donaldson (February 15, 1893 – July 15, 1947) was a prolific American popular songwriter and publishing company founder, composing many hit songs of the 1910s to 1940s, that have become standards and form part of the Great American Songbook.

==History==
Walter Donaldson was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of a piano teacher. While still in school he wrote original music for school productions, and had his first professional songs published in 1915. In 1918, he had his first major hit with &quot;The Daughter of Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot;.

During World War I, Donaldson entertained troops at Camp Upton, New York. His time there inspired him to write &quot;How Ya Gonna Keep &#x27;em Down on the Farm (After They&#x27;ve Seen Paree)?&quot;

After serving in the United States Army in World War I, Donaldson was hired as a songwriter by Irving Berlin Music Company. He stayed with Berlin until 1928, producing many hit songs, then in 1928 established his own publishing company. Although Walter Donaldson&#x27;s company was officially known as &quot;Donaldson, Douglas &amp; Gumble, Inc.&quot;, it was printed in fine print alongside Walter Donaldson&#x27;s name in every publication.

Donaldson frequently worked with lyricist Gus Kahn, after first working together in 1915.

Donaldson is primarily known as a composer, rather than as a lyricist, although he wrote words and music for dozens of songs. Among the big hits for which he wrote both words and music were &quot;At Sundown&quot; and &quot;Little White Lies&quot;. In his prolific career, he published some 600 original songs.

At the end of the 1920s, Donaldson moved to Hollywood, California, and worked composing and arranging music for motion pictures. His film credits include work on such pictures as &quot;Glorifying the American Girl&quot;, &quot;Suzy&quot;, &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;, &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Buzzin&#x27;, Cousin?&quot;. He married Dorothy &quot;Wally&quot; in 1935, who was on the New York stage as Wanda Mansfield, but they divorced in 1942 after having two children.

Walter Donaldson retired in 1943, and died four years later in Santa Monica, California, after being ill for a year with kidney problems. He is buried at an unmarked grave at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Brooklyn.

<doc id="246173" wikidata="Q187921" url="?curid=246173" title="Phenolphthalein">
<text>Phenolphthalein ( ) is a chemical compound with the formula C20H14O4 and is often written as &quot;HIn&quot;, &quot;HPh&quot;, &quot;phph&quot; or simply &quot;Ph&quot; in shorthand notation. Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in acid–base titrations. For this application, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions. It belongs to the class of dyes known as phthalein dyes.

Phenolphthalein is slightly soluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H+ ions in solution. The nonionized phenolphthalein molecule is colorless and the double deprotonated phenolphthalein ion is fuchsia. Further proton loss in higher pH occurs slowly and leads to a colorless form. Phenolphthalein ion in concentrated sulfuric acid is orange red due to sulfonation.

==Uses==
===pH indicator===

Phenolphthalein&#x27;s common use is as an indicator in acid-base titrations. It also serves as a component of universal indicator, together with methyl red, bromothymol blue, and thymol blue.

Phenolphthalein adopts different forms in aqueous solution depending on the pH of the solution. Inconsistency exists in the literature about hydrated forms of the compounds and the color of sulfuric acid. Wittke reported in 1983 that it exists in protonated form (H3In+) under strongly acidic conditions, providing an orange coloration. However, a later paper suggested that this color is due to sulfonation to phenolsulfonphthalein.

The lactone form (H2In) is colorless between strongly acidic and slightly basic conditions. The doubly deprotonated (In2-) phenolate form (the anion form of phenol) gives the familiar pink color. In strongly basic solutions, phenolphthalein is converted to its In(OH)3− form, and its pink color undergoes a rather slow fading reaction and becomes completely colorless when pH is greater than 13.

The p&quot;K&quot;a values of phenolphthalein were found to be 9.05, 9.50 and 12 while those of phenolsulfonphthalein are 1.2 and 7.70. The p&quot;K&quot;a for the color change is 9.50.

====Carbonation of concrete====
Phenolphthalein&#x27;s pH sensitivity is exploited in other applications: concrete has naturally high pH due to the calcium hydroxide formed when Portland cement reacts with water. As the concrete reacts with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, pH decreases to 8.5–9. When a 1% phenolphthalein solution is applied to normal concrete, it turns bright pink. However, if it remains colorless, it shows that the concrete has undergone carbonation. In a similar application, some spackling used to repair holes in drywall contains phenolphthalein. When applied, the basic spackling material retains a pink color; when the spackling has cured by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, the pink color fades.

====Education====
In a highly basic solution, phenolphthalein&#x27;s slow change from pink to colorless as it is converted to its Ph(OH)3− form is used in chemistry classes for the study of reaction kinetics.

====Entertainment====
Phenolphthalein is used in toys, for example as a component of disappearing inks, or disappearing dye on the &quot;Hollywood Hair&quot; Barbie hair. In the ink, it is mixed with sodium hydroxide, which reacts with carbon dioxide in the air. This reaction leads to the pH falling below the color change threshold as hydrogen ions are released by the reaction:
:OH−(aq) + CO2(g) → (aq) + H+(aq).

To develop the hair and &quot;magic&quot; graphical patterns, the ink is sprayed with a solution of hydroxide, which leads to the appearance of the hidden graphics by the same mechanism described above for color change in alkaline solution. The pattern will eventually disappear again because of the reaction with carbon dioxide. Thymolphthalein is used for the same purpose and in the same way, when a blue color is desired.

==== Detection of blood ====

A reduced form of phenolphthalein, phenolphthalin, which is colorless, is used in a test to identify substances thought to contain blood, commonly known as the Kastle–Meyer test. A dry sample is collected with a swab or filter paper. A few drops of alcohol, then a few drops of phenolphthalein, and finally a few drops of hydrogen peroxide are dripped onto the sample. If the sample contains hemoglobin, it will turn pink immediately upon addition of the peroxide, because of the generation of phenolphthalein. A positive test indicates the sample contains hemoglobin and, therefore, is likely blood. A false positive can result from the presence of substances with catalytic activity similar to hemoglobin. This test is not destructive to the sample; it can be kept and used in further tests. This test has the same reaction with blood from any animal whose blood contains hemoglobin, including almost all vertebrates; further testing would be required to determine whether it originated from a human.

===Laxative===

Phenolphthalein has been used for over a century as a laxative, but is now being removed from over-the-counter laxatives over concerns of carcinogenicity. Laxative products formerly containing phenolphthalein have often been reformulated with alternative active ingredients: Feen-a-Mint switched to bisacodyl, and Ex-Lax was switched to a senna extract.

Thymolphthalein is a related laxative made from thymol.

Despite concerns regarding its carcinogenicity based on rodent studies, the use of phenolphthalein as a laxative is unlikely to cause ovarian cancer. Some studies suggest a weak association with colon cancer, while others show none at all.

Phenolphthalein is described as a stimulant laxative. In addition, it has been found to inhibit human cellular calcium influx via store-operated calcium entry (SOCE, see ) &quot;in vivo&quot;. This is effected by its inhibiting thrombin and thapsigargin, two activators of SOCE that increase intracellular free calcium.

Phenolphthalein has been added to the European Chemicals Agency&#x27;s candidate list for substance of very high concern (SVHC). It is on the IARC group 2B list for substances &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot;.

The discovery of phenolphthalein&#x27;s laxative effect was due to an attempt by the Hungarian government to label genuine local white wine with the substance in 1900. Phenolphthalein did not change the taste of the wine and would change color when a base is added, making it a good label in principle. However, it was found that ingestion of the substance led to diarrhea. Max Kiss, a Hungarian-born pharmacist residing in New York, heard about the news and launched Ex-Lax in 1906.

==Synthesis==
Phenolphthalein can be synthesized by condensation of phthalic anhydride with two equivalents of phenol under acidic conditions. It was discovered in 1871 by Adolf von Baeyer.

<text>The Finnish War (; ; ) was fought between the Kingdom of Sweden and the Russian Empire from 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809 as part of the Napoleonic Wars. As a result of the war, the eastern third of Sweden was established as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire. Other notable effects were the Swedish parliament&#x27;s adoption of a new constitution and the establishment of the House of Bernadotte, the new Swedish royal house, in 1818.

== Background ==


After the Russian Emperor Alexander I concluded the 1807 Treaty of Tilsit with Napoleon, Alexander, in his letter on 24 September 1807 to the Swedish King Gustav IV Adolf, informed the king that the peaceful relations between Russia and Sweden depended on Swedish agreement to abide by the limitations of the Treaty of Tilsit which in practice meant that Sweden would have been required to follow the Continental System. The king, who viewed Napoleon as the Antichrist and Britain as his ally against Napoleon&#x27;s France, was apprehensive of the system&#x27;s ruinous consequences for Sweden&#x27;s maritime commerce. He instead entered into negotiations with Britain in order to prepare a joint attack against Denmark, whose Norwegian possessions he coveted.

In the meantime, the Royal Navy attacked Copenhagen and the Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812) was declared. Referring to the treaties of 1780 and 1800, the emperor demanded that Gustav Adolf close the Baltic Sea to all foreign warships. Although he reiterated his demand on November 16, 1807, it took two months before the king responded that it was impossible to honor the previous arrangements as long as the French were in control of the major Baltic ports. King Gustav Adolf did this after securing an alliance with Britain on 8 February 1808. Meanwhile, on 30 December 1807 Russia announced it would be forced to act should Sweden not give a clear reply.

Although most Swedish officers were sceptical about their chances in fighting the larger and more experienced Imperial Russian Army, Gustav Adolf had an unrealistic view of Sweden&#x27;s ability to defend itself against Russia. In Saint Petersburg, his stubbornness was viewed as a convenient pretext for Russia to occupy Finland, thus pushing the Russo-Swedish frontier considerably to the west of the Russian capital and safeguarding it in case of any future hostilities between the two powers.

The situation was problematic for Sweden, since it once again faced both Denmark and Russia as potential enemies requiring the Swedes to split their forces. The king had thought it impossible to defend Finland should the enemy attack during the winter and chose largely to ignore the repeated warnings of the Russian threat he received in early 1808. Most of the Swedish plans assumed that warfare would be impossible during winter, disregarding the lessons from recent wars. In addition, several new good roads had been built into Finland greatly reducing the earlier dependency on naval support for any large operation in Finland.

The Swedish plan was to first passively defend and hold on to the fortifications in the southern coast of Finland, in which Sweden had strong garrisons, while the rest of the Swedish Army retreated to the north. Then in the spring, counterattack simultaneously from north and south, when the Swedish army would have naval support and the Russian army would be spread over Finland and thus have long supply lines. The basic reason for the plan was to avoid major decisive battles.

Some advocates existed for taking a more active approach immediately, namely Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Möller (fi) who advocated for taking an immediate offensive and Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt who supported actively delaying the advancing enemies in co-operation with the garrisons on the southern coast.

In the end, instructions which the new Swedish commander in Finland, General Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor, received from the king were an unsuccessful and open-ended mixture of ideas from these very different plans.

Russia had gathered a wealth of information from Finland using spies and other sources. The level of detail was so great that Russian maps of Finland were in many respects more accurate than their Swedish counterparts. The Russians used the services of General Georg Magnus Sprengtporten when forming their plans. Sprengtporten suggested going on to an offensive during the winter since Finland would be mostly isolated when seas were frozen. His ideas were further developed by General Jan Pieter van Suchtelen before General Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden was appointed as the commander of the Russian army in Finland in December 1807.

The plan involved using the series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first take control of the whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in Savolax (Finnish: &quot;Savo&quot;) were to press hard against the Swedes and reach the Gulf of Bothnia towards Uleåborg (Finnish: &quot;Oulu&quot;) and Vasa (Finnish: &quot;Vaasa&quot;) to cut off the retreat of the main body of the Swedish army.

== February–May 1808 ==
On February 21, 1808, 24,000 Russian troops under Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoevden crossed the border in Ahvenkoski and took the town of Lovisa (Finnish: &quot;Loviisa&quot;). Since Klingspor had not arrived, Lieutenant General Karl Nathanael af Klercker acted as Swedish commander in Finland. He was notified of the Russian invasion already on 21 February and since it was impossible to hold the predefined defense lines as the army had not yet fully assembled, he ordered the army to assemble at Tavastehus (Finnish: &quot;Hämeenlinna&quot;). Before the engagement started, Klingspor finally arrived on 2 March and assumed command. Instead of facing the Russians at Tavastehus, he ordered the army to withdraw. In Savolax the Russians also forced the Swedes to withdraw. The king was quite unprepared for the attack, especially as war was not declared until April. About 21,000 Swedish troops were stationed in various fortresses in Finland, while the rest of his army was unable to leave southern Sweden for fear of Danish attack.
The Russian advance was swift. On the first day of the war they had captured the town of Lovisa and besieged the Swedish sea fortress of Svartholm. Borgå (Finnish: &quot;Porvoo&quot;) was captured on 24 February and Helsingfors (Finnish: &quot;Helsinki&quot;) on 2 March. Abandoned Swedish fortifications on the Hangö Peninsula (Finnish: &quot;Hanko&quot;) were taken and manned on 21 March and on the same day the Russian army took Åbo (Finnish: &quot;Turku&quot;) while a small detachment was sent to Åland. Before the end of March 1808 even Vasa was taken. In Savolax, Russians also advanced rapidly and took Kuopio on 16 March. Swedish forces had mostly just withdrawn before the advancing Russian often destroying usable materials. For example, the Swedish archipelago fleet&#x27;s ships that had been docked in Åbo (nearly 50 gun sloops) were torched to prevent their capture.

The Swedish fortress of Svartholm, commanded by Major Carl Magnus Gripenberg, was ill-prepared for a war. While the garrison was 700 men strong, only a third of the men had actually functioning weapons, while most of the fortress&#x27; guns had no carriages. The fortress had fallen into disrepair and lacked both adequate food and ammunition stores. Even the wells were found to be unusable. After starting the siege on 21 February, the Russians issued a surrender demand for the fort, but this was refused by the Swedes. The demand was repeated on 2 March but without success. After a meager Russian bombardment, Gripenberg agreed to negotiations on 10 March. The fortress surrendered to the Russians on 18 March after a siege that had lasted roughly a month, with just one man having been wounded in action.

Sveaborg (Finnish: &quot;Suomenlinna&quot;) under Admiral Carl Olof Cronstedt had been well prepared for the war with a garrison of 6,000 men, over 700 cannons, and enough stores to last until the summer of 1808. Defenses were strong enough to prevent the Russians from trying to storm the fortress by surprise. Instead the Russians laid siege to Sveaborg. The fortress surrendered on 6 May 1808 after prolonged negotiations with the Russians as the commanding officer Carl Olof Cronstedt and his council believed that resistance was futile. The Russians gained the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet intact as well as large stores of supplies and munitions.

The Russians had advanced considerably but they had also gained the long and vulnerable coastline with it. After the sea would be clear of ice there would be nothing to prevent Swedish forces from landing troops on the shore. With the Royal Navy supporting the Swedish Navy there was little the Russian Baltic Fleet could accomplish. Capture of the main body of the Swedish archipelago fleet had resulted in a real advantage to the Russians since it allowed them to gain superiority in the narrow waters of the Finnish archipelago where large ships of the line could not operate. Even the powerful explosion at Sveaborg which destroyed several of the captured ships did little to change Russian superiority in the Finnish archipelago. The Russians utilized the guns from the burned ships, and from those which burned during the winter, and constructed several fortifications on the coast, both in Hangö as well as along narrow passages leading to Åbo.

Under Colonel Carl Johan Adlercreutz the Swedish army counter-attacked at Siikajoki and began to halt the Russian offensive. Soon after at the Battle of Revolax (Finnish: &quot;Revonlahti&quot;), the Swedish army under Colonel Johan Adam Cronstedt started an advance towards the south. These successes yielded a promotion to Field Marshal for Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor. The Swedish advance was very slow however, as operations were often halted due to the thaw. An exception was the brigade under Colonel Johan August Sandels, which swiftly advanced towards Kuopio. Nikolay Tuchkov, a Russian general who was dispatched to the north of Finland, left garrisons in every fort along his way. This reduced his unit to 4,000 troops, which proved insufficient to pacify the hostile country. The Finns rose up in guerrilla fighting as far east as Frederikshamn (Finnish: &quot;Hamina&quot;) within the Old Finland province of Russia.

In May, the Russians suffered further setbacks when they were driven from Gotland and Åland, where a Swedish flotilla, supported by the local population, compelled the small Russian force left on the main island of Fasta Åland to surrender, and then invaded the island of Kumlinge where the bulk of the Russian garrison on the Åland Islands was based. After a two-hour-long battle, the local militia, together with the Swedish landing force, overwhelmed their enemies and Colonel Vuich and his garrison were compelled to surrender.

On May 26, a British fleet carrying 14,000 troops under Sir John Moore entered the port of Gothenburg. Due to various disagreements with the Swedish king, however, they never landed and sailed off to fight the French in Spain after leaving 16 battleships and 20 other ships at Sweden&#x27;s disposal.

== June–July 1808 ==
The Swedish battlefleet which had been expelling Russians from Gotland was ordered to blockade the Hangö Peninsula and reached the cape on 10 June. Due to bad weather and poor visibility the fleet under Admiral Rudolf Cederström chose to stay relatively far from the coast. Upon approaching the coast on 21 June, Cederström learned that the Russians had already passed the cape some time earlier. Attempts to stop the Russians deeper in the archipelago were also unsuccessful. Failure to block the Russians led the king to relieve Cederström of his duties and replace him with Commander Henrik Johan Nauckhoff.

Major General Eberhard von Vegesack was chosen to lead the first Swedish army to Finland. He was to lead a force of 2,600 men, land somewhere between Nystad (Finnish: &quot;Uusikaupunki&quot;) and Åbo, and then capture the latter. Von Vegesack instead chose to land his force at the Lemo (Finnish: &quot;Lemu&quot;) manor house a few kilometers south of Åbo. The landing began on 19 June and was initially successful. The surprised Russians garrisoned at Åbo reacted quickly, however, and deployed over 3,000 men to stop the landing force. By the morning of 20 June, the Swedish forces were forced to withdraw. In addition, Colonel Johan Bergenstråhle landed 1,100 Swedes just a few kilometers northeast of Vasa on 25 June and managed to quickly advance to the town. The Russians, however, managed to gather a force of 3,000 men which was able to force the ill-trained Swedes to withdraw.

The advance of the Russian coastal squadron beyond Hangö created difficulties for the Swedes. The strength of the Swedish coastal forces deployed to the Finnish archipelago was equal in size to the coastal fleet that the Russians had obtained by the Sveaborg surrender. To prevent the Russians from gaining strength, the Swedish coastal fleet&#x27;s unit under Rear Admiral Claes Hjelmstjerna tried to engage them twice in battle. The first was at the Battle of Rimito Kramp on 30 June, and after Russians withdrew closer to Åbo, the second was a battle at Pukkisaari on 4 July. Fighting ended in a stalemate, but can be viewed as a Swedish failure since they failed to decisively defeat the Russians.
Having been alerted to the approach of additional Russian coastal units from Sveaborg, the Swedish forces moved to intercept them before they could link up with the Russian coastal unit now bottled up at Åbo. Learning that the Russians intended to go around the island of Kimito (Finnish: &quot;Kemiönsaari&quot;), a Swedish force of gunboats was deployed to the narrows. They met the Russians first at Tallholmen on 21 July and again on 2 August in the Battle of Sandöström. Swedish attempts to land troops and artillery in support of the gunboats at Vestankärr on 2 August ended in failure, though the attempt came very close to capturing General Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden. While none of the fights ended with a decisive winner, the overall strategic victory went to Russia, who gained advantage in the Finnish archipelago by managing to link up their separate coastal units.

Sweden performed several small landings along the coast near Kristinestad (Finnish: &quot;Kristiinankaupunki&quot;) and Kaskö (Finnish: &quot;Kaskinen&quot;) and managed to raise local men to oppose the Russians. The first occurred on 3 July with several others taking place soon after. Altogether the Swedes had several hundred local men-in-arms. The Russians, however, were able to send reinforcements to the area which were, in addition to being numerically superior, both far better trained and equipped than the peasants and militia the Swedes had raised. By the end of July the small forces Sweden had landed and the men that had supported them were either beaten or withdrawn back to their ships.

== August–September 1808 ==
After the Russians were driven from Central Finland, their forces stretched along the line of Pori–Tampere–Mikkeli. Having received considerable reinforcements, their numbers increased to 55,000, as opposed to the 36,000 estimated for Sweden. On 14 August, Count Nikolay Kamensky decided to use this numerical superiority to launch a new offensive.

Kamensky&#x27;s 11,000-strong corps achieved important victories at Kuortane (1 September) and Salmi (2 September), and although Georg Carl von Döbeln won the Battle of Jutas for Sweden on 13 September, Kamensky gained the most important victory at Oravais on 14 September. Swedish attempts to land more troops near Åbo were stalled by Lieutenant-General Pyotr Bagration&#x27;s prompt actions. In Eastern Finland, the guerrilla movement was gradually extinguished. As a consequence, Russia&#x27;s situation in Southern Finland improved significantly.

In the north, the situation was more complicated. Tuchkov&#x27;s battered unit strained to hold its own against Sandels, while the progress of a relief force under General Alekseyev was contained by guerrilla fighters. It was not until 26 September that Prince Dolgorukov (Alekseyev&#x27;s replacement) managed to join his forces with Tuchkov&#x27;s, inducing Sandels to retreat. Three days later, Buxhoeveden—pressed by the early onset of winter weather—signed an armistice, much to the dismay of Alexander I. The emperor refused to ratify the truce and replaced Buxhoeveden with a new commander-in-chief, Bogdan von Knorring, in December of that year.

In the south, the Swedish battle fleet remained anchored within the Finnish archipelago, blocking some of the deeper coastal sea routes from Hangö towards Åbo. Russian ships continued to arrive from the east but remained within the shallow narrows where the Swedish ships of the line could not reach. Small boat actions took place during the night time of 17–18 July which became known as the &quot;skirmish at Lövö&quot; (). However, the Swedish fleet dropped its blockade on 22 August, allowing the Russian coastal units to unite. Odds were very much against the Swedes as the Russians had nearly one hundred coastal ships in the Finnish archipelago, against which Sweden could deploy only 7 galleys and 30 gun sloops.

Swedish efforts to harass the Russians with landings continued, with roughly 1,000 volunteers under Captain Anders Gyllenbögel landing on 1 August to support Swedish-led uprisings on the coast south of Vasa. The landing succeeded, and together with Swedish troops advancing from the north, they managed to drive the Russians towards Björneborg (Finnish: &quot;Pori&quot;). Swedish patrol ships (consisting of armed merchant vessels) scouted and raided the coast, taking Russians prisoners to Åland. These raids caused much confusion, and Russian responses to them thinned their strength along the coast. Also the Swedish southern army of Finland, consisting of roughly 4,000 men under Major General Eberhard von Vegesack, was moved from Åland to Finland, and landed at Kristinestad in late autumn, joining with von Döbeln&#x27;s forces. However, since von Vegesack had been ordered to land his men at Björneborg, the king, after pursuing the matter unsuccessfully in military tribunals, condemned von Vegesack to lose his rank and title.

A Russian battle fleet under Admiral Pyotr Khanykov (also &quot;Chanikoff&quot;) sortied in late July to clear the Swedish blockades in the archipelago, to cut contact between Åland and Sweden, and to stop Swedish supply transports sailing in the Gulf of Bothnia. The Russian fleet reached Hangö on 6 August and chose not to engage the scattered Swedish fleet elements in the vicinity. On 20 August, two British ships of the line (HMS &quot;Implacable&quot; and &quot;Centaur&quot;) joined the Swedish fleet. The allied fleet moved on 25 August 1808 to engage the Russian fleet, which turned and attempted to reach the relative safety of Baltiyskiy Port. The British ships were far superior sailing ships compared to those of either the Swedes or Russians, and engaged the withdrawing Russian squadron (nine ships of the line and several frigates) on their own. The last of the Russian ships of the line was disabled and then captured and burned by the British ships. More Royal Navy ships (including HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot;, and &quot;Africa&quot;) arrived to oversee a blockade of the Russian fleet at Baltiyskiy Port which continued until the sea started to freeze. The Swedish fleet suffered from outbreaks of scurvy and had been unable to maintain the blockade on its own.

Skirmishes and landings continued in the Finnish archipelago from late summer into autumn. On 30 August, the Swedish coastal fleet defeated its Russian adversaries at the Battle of Grönvikssund, forcing the Russians to abandon their plans to invade Åland and concentrate on defense. On 17 September, the Swedes landed again, this time at Lokalax (Finnish: &quot;Lokalahti&quot;), while the coastal fleet covering the landing managed to keep the Russians away in the Battle of Palva Sund on 18 September. The troops that landed were forced to withdraw to their ships on 18 September, but landed in Finland again on 26 September. However, owing to bad weather, only a portion of the troops that had been intended to participate in the landing actually reached the Finnish coast, and this resulted in another withdrawal on 28 September.

The Swedish situation was further weakened by being at war with France and Denmark, both of whom threatened Sweden&#x27;s possessions, with a joint invasion force of 45,000 troops in Denmark (under French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte) and a further 36,000 in Norway. This forced the Swedes to allocate forces to southern Sweden and along the Norwegian border (23,000 troops). Denmark had declared war on Sweden on 14 March and some battles and skirmishes were fought along the Norwegian border. In April Napoleon began to devote more attention to the situation in Spain, and the British navy remained a continuous threat for troop movements between Denmark and Sweden.

== Winter 1808 ==

By November 1808, Russian forces had overrun all of Finland. On 19 November, the Convention of Olkijoki was signed and the Swedish army was forced to leave the Finnish countryside. The Russian emperor was, however, now eager to bring hostilities to the territory of Sweden proper, which was certain to bring the war to a victorious end.

With this objective in mind, Kamensky suggested a daring plan, whereby the Russian army was to cross the frozen Gulf of Bothnia at two locations: one unit was to march from Vasa towards Umeå and the other from Åbo to Åland and thence towards the vicinity of Stockholm. A third unit was to advance into Sweden by land, going around the gulf and through the town of Torneå (Finnish: &quot;Tornio&quot;).

Although Knorring was urged to execute the plan as quickly as possible, he regarded the idea as unrealistic and procrastinated until March, when the emperor dispatched the War Minister Arakcheyev to Finland in order to pressure Knorring into action before joining the army himself.

== Spring 1809 ==

As Russian forces embarked upon their unprecedented march across the frozen gulf, King Gustav IV, accused of fatal mistakes leading to the loss of Finland—was dethroned by a coup in Stockholm on 13 March, and his uncle was proclaimed Charles XIII of Sweden. Four days later, Bagration&#x27;s corps of 17,000 men occupied the strategic Åland Islands, while Kulnev led a vanguard further across the frozen sea that on 19 March reached the Swedish shore within 70 km from Stockholm.

When news of Kulnev&#x27;s incursion spread to the Swedish capital, the new king sent an embassy to Knorring, proposing a truce. The Russian commander agreed and speedily recalled Kulnev back to Åland. Meanwhile, the other Russian contingent—5,000 men under Barclay de Tolly—endured great hardship in crossing the frozen gulf further north; they entered Umeå on 24 March.

The third force, commanded by Count Shuvalov, struck against Torneå and, braving fierce frost, encircled a Swedish army, which capitulated on 25 March. Six days later, the tsar arrived in Åbo and, on learning about the truce, not only revoked Knorring&#x27;s signature but named Barclay de Tolly as the new commander-in-chief. Hostilities thus continued until May, when Shuvalov finally reached Umeå, where he was succeeded by Kamensky.

== Summer 1809 and conclusion ==

A British Royal Navy fleet under Admiral James Saumarez had arrived in Sweden in May and he concentrated his ships, 10 ship of the line and 17 smaller ships, to the Gulf of Finland. The presence of the British naval units kept the Russian battlefleet strictly confined to Kronstadt, and after the British constructed artillery batteries to the Porkkala cape they cut off the coastal sea route from Russian ships. Total British control of the Gulf of Finland was a large obstacle to the Russian supply network and required sizable garrisons to be posted all along the Finnish coast. The Royal Navy captured 35 Russian ships and burnt 20 others before leaving the Baltic Sea on 28 September 1809.

In August, Charles XIII, anxious to improve his position at a peace settlement, ordered General Gustav Wachtmeister to land in the north of Sweden and to attack Kamensky&#x27;s rear. Engagements at Sävar and Ratan proved inconclusive and Kamensky succeeded in neutralizing this belated counter-offensive, following up with a final victory over the Swedes at Piteå.
Wachtmeister&#x27;s action was only a prelude to the peace negotiations that opened in August and resulted in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn (17 September), in which Sweden ceded the whole of Finland and all of its domains east of the Torne river (the north-eastern parts of what was then called &quot;Västerbotten&quot;, today &quot;Norrbotten&quot;) to Russia. Sweden then joined the Continental System and closed its harbours to British ships, leading to a formal declaration of war on Great Britain. A few months later, on 6 January 1810, the Russian government mediated the Treaty of Paris between Sweden and France.

Russia would create the Grand Duchy of Finland from the territory obtained from Sweden, and would attach the areas gained from Sweden in the 18th century (so-called Old Finland) to the new Grand Duchy in 1812. The Grand Duchy of Finland was to retain the Gustavian constitution of 1772 with only slight modifications until 1919. Almost all Finnish soldiers in Sweden (most of them in the Umeå area) were repatriated after the war.

==Analysis==
Sufficient stocks of supplies had not been prepared for the Swedish army, since King Gustaf IV Adolf thought it might be taken as provocative by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility of the armed forces or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against a besieging enemy.

In 1808 a British expeditionary force under John Moore arrived in Sweden, but after months of idleness departed for the beginning of the Peninsular War. Had the king accepted the landing of 10,000 British troops in Skåne, where the expeditionary force had been authorized to disembark, it would have enabled the Swedes to release at least 10,000 trained soldiers for the Finnish War. As it happened, the bulk of the Swedish army, including the best units, were kept out of the Finnish War by the king, who reserved them for his plans for conquering either Sjælland or Norway. Swedish landings were invariably made with poorly equipped and trained forces, often with troops who had very low morale. Landings were further complicated by the Swedish Navy&#x27;s failure to tightly block the coastal sea route past Hangö.

==Commemoration==

The 200th anniversary of the war was selected as the main motif for a high value commemorative coin, the €100 200th Anniversary of Finnish War commemorative coin, minted by Finland in 2008. The motif on the coin is the passage of Finland from Sweden to Russia. The same coin depicts both the pre-war Finnish history, with the withdrawing Swedish crown on the reverse side, and the post-war future of the country, with the Russian eagle symbol on the obverse side.

==Legacy==
According to two 2015 studies by political scientists Jan Teorell and Bo Rothstein, Sweden&#x27;s loss in the Finnish War led to reforms of the Swedish bureaucracy. Prior to 1809, Sweden had a reputation as one of Europe&#x27;s most corrupt countries, but the loss in the war created the perception of an existential threat in the east for Sweden and motivated Swedish elites to reform its bureaucracy. The motivation behind the reforms were to make the Swedish state more effective and functional, and thus protect against the existential threat in the East.

<text>The Gettier problem, in the field of epistemology, is a landmark philosophical problem concerning the understanding of descriptive knowledge. Attributed to American philosopher Edmund Gettier, Gettier-type counterexamples (called &quot;Gettier-cases&quot;) challenge the long-held justified true belief (JTB) account of knowledge. The JTB account holds that knowledge is equivalent to justified true belief; if all three conditions (justification, truth, and belief) are met of a given claim, then we have knowledge of that claim. In his 1963 three-page paper titled &quot;Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?&quot;, Gettier attempts to illustrate by means of two counterexamples that there are cases where individuals can have a justified, true belief regarding a claim but still fail to know it because the reasons for the belief, while justified, turn out to be false. Thus, Gettier claims to have shown that the JTB account is inadequate because it does not account for all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.

The terms &quot;Gettier problem&quot;, &quot;Gettier case&quot;, or even the adjective &quot;Gettiered&quot;, are sometimes used to describe any case in the field of epistemology that purports to repudiate the JTB account of knowledge.

Responses to Gettier&#x27;s paper have been numerous. Some reject Gettier&#x27;s examples as inadequate justification, while others seek to adjust the JTB account of knowledge and blunt the force of these counterexamples. Gettier problems have even found their way into sociological experiments in which researchers have studied intuitive responses to Gettier cases from people of varying demographics.

==History==
The question of what constitutes &quot;knowledge&quot; is as old as philosophy itself. Early instances are found in Plato&#x27;s dialogues, notably &quot;Meno&quot; (97a–98b) and &quot;Theaetetus&quot;. Gettier himself was not actually the first to raise the problem named after him; its existence was acknowledged by both Alexius Meinong and Bertrand Russell, the latter of which discussed the problem in his book &quot;Human knowledge: Its scope and limits&quot;. In fact, the problem has been known since the Middle Ages, and both Indian philosopher Dharmottara and scholastic logician Peter of Mantua presented examples of it.

Dharmottara, in his commentary on Dharmakirti&#x27;s &quot;Ascertainment of Knowledge&quot;, gives the following two examples:

Various theories of knowledge, including some of the proposals that emerged in Western philosophy after Gettier in 1963, were debated by Indo-Tibetan epistemologists before and after Dharmottara. In particular, Gaṅgeśa in the 14th century advanced a detailed causal theory of knowledge.

Russell&#x27;s case, called the stopped clock case, goes as follows: Alice sees a clock that reads two o&#x27;clock and believes that the time is two o&#x27;clock. It is, in fact, two o&#x27;clock. There&#x27;s a problem, however: unknown to Alice, the clock she&#x27;s looking at stopped twelve hours ago. Alice thus has an accidentally true, justified belief. Russell provides an answer of his own to the problem. Edmund Gettier&#x27;s formulation of the problem was important as it coincided with the rise of the sort of philosophical naturalism promoted by W. V. O. Quine and others, and was used as a justification for a shift towards externalist theories of justification. John L. Pollock and Joseph Cruz have stated that the Gettier problem has &quot;fundamentally altered the character of contemporary epistemology&quot; and has become &quot;a central problem of epistemology since it poses a clear barrier to analyzing knowledge&quot;.

Alvin Plantinga rejects the historical analysis:
Despite this, Plantinga &quot;does&quot; accept that some philosophers before Gettier have advanced a JTB account of knowledge, specifically C. I. Lewis and A. J. Ayer.

==Knowledge as justified true belief (JTB)==

The JTB account of knowledge is the claim that knowledge can be conceptually analyzed as justified true belief, which is to say that the &quot;meaning&quot; of sentences such as &quot;Smith knows that it rained today&quot; can be given with the following set of conditions, which are necessary and sufficient for knowledge to obtain:

The JTB account was first credited to Plato, though Plato argued against this very account of knowledge in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; (210a). This account of knowledge is what Gettier subjected to criticism.

==Gettier&#x27;s two original counterexamples==

Gettier&#x27;s paper used counterexamples to argue that there are cases of beliefs that are both true and justified—therefore satisfying all three conditions for knowledge on the JTB account—but that do not appear to be genuine cases of knowledge. Therefore, Gettier argued, his counterexamples show that the JTB account of knowledge is false, and thus that a different conceptual analysis is needed to correctly track what we mean by &quot;knowledge&quot;.

Gettier&#x27;s case is based on two counterexamples to the JTB analysis, both involving a fictional character named Smith. Each relies on two claims. Firstly, that justification is preserved by entailment, and secondly that this applies coherently to Smith&#x27;s putative &quot;belief&quot;. That is, that if Smith is justified in believing P, and Smith realizes that the truth of P entails the truth of Q, then Smith would &quot;also&quot; be justified in believing Q. Gettier calls these counterexamples &quot;Case I&quot; and &quot;Case II&quot;:

===Case I===
===Case II===
==False premises and generalized Gettier-style problems==
In both of Gettier&#x27;s actual examples (see also counterfactual conditional), the justified true belief came about, if Smith&#x27;s purported claims are disputable, as the result of entailment (but see also material conditional) from justified false beliefs that &quot;Jones will get the job&quot; (in case I), and that &quot;Jones owns a Ford&quot; (in case II). This led some early responses to Gettier to conclude that the definition of knowledge could be easily adjusted, so that knowledge was justified true belief that does not depend on false premises. The interesting issue that arises is then of how to know which premises are in reality false or true when deriving a conclusion, because as in the Gettier cases, one sees that premises can be very reasonable to believe and be likely true, but unknown to the believer there are confounding factors and extra information that may have been missed while concluding something. The question that arises is therefore to what extent would one have to be able to go about attempting to &quot;prove&quot; all premises in the argument before solidifying a conclusion.

===The generalized problem===
In a 1966 scenario known as &quot;The sheep in the field&quot;, Roderick Chisholm asks us to imagine that someone, X, is standing outside a field looking at something that looks like a sheep (although in fact, it is a dog disguised as a sheep). X believes there is a sheep in the field, and in fact, X is right because there is a sheep behind the hill in the middle of the field. Hence, X has a justified true belief that there is a sheep in the field.

Another scenario by Brian Skyrms is &quot;The Pyromaniac&quot;, in which a struck match lights not for the reasons the pyromaniac imagines but because of some unknown &quot;Q radiation&quot;.

A different perspective on the issue is given by Alvin Goldman in the &quot;fake barns&quot; scenario (crediting Carl Ginet with the example). In this one, a man is driving in the countryside, and sees what looks exactly like a barn. Accordingly, he thinks that he is seeing a barn. In fact, that is what he is doing. But what he does not know is that the neighborhood generally consists of many fake barns—barn facades designed to look exactly like real barns when viewed from the road. Since, if he had been looking at one of them, he would have been unable to tell the difference, his &quot;knowledge&quot; that he was looking at a barn would seem to be poorly founded.

===Objections to the &quot;no false premises&quot; approach===
The &quot;no false premises&quot; (or &quot;no false lemmas&quot;) solution which was proposed early in the discussion has been criticized, as more general Gettier-style problems were then constructed or contrived in which the justified true belief is said to not seem to be the result of a chain of reasoning from a justified false belief. For example:

It is argued that it seems as though Luke does not &quot;know&quot; that Mark is in the room, even though it is claimed he has a justified true belief that Mark is in the room, but it is not nearly so clear that the &quot;perceptual belief&quot; that &quot;Mark is in the room&quot; was inferred from any premises at all, let alone any false ones, nor led to significant conclusions on its own; Luke did not seem to be reasoning about anything; &quot;Mark is in the room&quot; seems to have been part of what he &quot;seemed to see&quot;.

==Constructing Gettier problems==

The main idea behind Gettier&#x27;s examples is that the justification for the belief is flawed or incorrect, but the belief turns out to be true by sheer luck. Linda Zagzebski shows that any analysis of knowledge in terms of true belief and some other element of justification that is independent from truth, will be liable to Gettier cases. She offers a formula for generating Gettier cases:

(1) start with a case of justified false belief;

(2) amend the example, making the element of justification strong enough for knowledge, but the belief false by sheer chance;

(3) amend the example again, adding another element of chance such that the belief is true, but which leaves the element of justification unchanged;

This will generate an example of a belief that is sufficiently justified (on some analysis of knowledge) to be knowledge, which is true, and which is intuitively not an example of knowledge. In other words, Gettier cases can be generated for any analysis of knowledge that involves a justification criterion and a truth criterion, which are highly correlated but have some degree of independence.

==Responses to Gettier==
The Gettier problem is formally a problem in first-order logic, but the introduction by Gettier of terms such as &quot;believes&quot; and &quot;knows&quot; moves the discussion into the field of epistemology. Here, the sound (true) arguments ascribed to Smith then need also to be valid (believed) and convincing (justified) if they are to issue in the real-world discussion about &quot;justified true belief&quot;.

Responses to Gettier problems have fallen into three categories:
* Affirmations of the JTB account: This response affirms the JTB account of knowledge, but rejects Gettier cases. Typically, the proponent of this response rejects Gettier cases because, they say, Gettier cases involve insufficient levels of justification. Knowledge actually requires higher levels of justification than Gettier cases involve.
* Fourth condition responses: This response accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases, and affirms that JTB is &quot;necessary&quot; (but not &quot;sufficient&quot;) for knowledge. A proper account of knowledge, according to this type of view, will contain at least fourth condition (JTB + ?). With the fourth condition in place, Gettier counterexamples (and other similar counterexamples) will not work, and we will have an adequate set of criteria that are both necessary and sufficient for knowledge.
* Justification replacement response: This response also accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases. However, instead of invoking a fourth condition, it seeks to replace Justification itself for some other third condition (?TB) (or remove it entirely) that will make counterexamples obsolete.

One response, therefore, is that in none of the above cases was the belief justified because it is impossible to justify anything that is not true. Conversely, the fact that a proposition turns out to be untrue is proof that it was not sufficiently justified in the first place. Under this interpretation, the JTB definition of knowledge survives. This shifts the problem to a definition of justification, rather than knowledge. Another view is that justification and non-justification are not in binary opposition. Instead, justification is a matter of degree, with an idea being more or less justified. This account of justification is supported by philosophers such as Paul Boghossian and Stephen Hicks . In common sense usage, an idea can not only be more justified or less justified but it can also be partially justified (Smith&#x27;s boss told him X) and partially unjustified (Smith&#x27;s boss is a liar). Gettier&#x27;s cases involve propositions that were true, believed, but which had weak justification. In case 1, the premise that the testimony of Smith&#x27;s boss is &quot;strong evidence&quot; is rejected. The case itself depends on the boss being either wrong or deceitful (Jones did not get the job) and therefore unreliable. In case 2, Smith again has accepted a questionable idea (Jones owns a Ford) with unspecified justification. Without justification, both cases do not undermine the JTB account of knowledge.

Other epistemologists accept Gettier&#x27;s conclusion. Their responses to the Gettier problem, therefore, consist of trying to find alternative analyses of knowledge. They have struggled to discover and agree upon as a beginning any single notion of truth, or belief, or justifying which is wholly and obviously accepted. Truth, belief, and justifying have not yet been satisfactorily defined, so that JTB (justified true belief) may be defined satisfactorily is still problematical, on account or otherwise of Gettier&#x27;s examples. Gettier, for many years a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst later also was interested in the epistemic logic of Hintikka, a Finnish philosopher at Boston University, who published &quot;Knowledge and Belief&quot; in 1962.

===The fourth condition (JTB + G) approaches===
The most common direction for this sort of response to take is what might be called a &quot;JTB + G&quot; analysis: that is, an analysis based on finding some &quot;fourth&quot; condition—a &quot;no-Gettier-problem&quot; condition—which, when added to the conditions of justification, truth, and belief, will yield a set of separately necessary and jointly sufficient conditions.

====Goldman&#x27;s causal theory====
One such response is that of Alvin Goldman (1967), who suggested the addition of a &quot;causal&quot; condition: a subject&#x27;s belief is justified, for Goldman, only if the truth of a belief has &quot;caused&quot; the subject to have that belief (in the appropriate way); and for a justified true belief to count as knowledge, the subject must &quot;also&quot; be able to &quot;correctly reconstruct&quot; (mentally) that causal chain. Goldman&#x27;s analysis would rule out Gettier cases in that Smith&#x27;s beliefs are not caused by the truths of those beliefs; it is merely &quot;accidental&quot; that Smith&#x27;s beliefs in the Gettier cases happen to be true, or that the prediction made by Smith: &quot;The winner of the job will have 10 coins&quot;, on the basis of his putative belief, (see also bundling) came true in this one case. This theory is challenged by the difficulty of giving a principled explanation of how an appropriate causal relationship differs from an inappropriate one (without the circular response of saying that the appropriate sort of causal relationship is the knowledge-producing one); or retreating to a position in which justified true belief is weakly defined as the consensus of learned opinion. The latter would be useful, but not as useful nor desirable as the unchanging definitions of scientific concepts such as momentum. Thus, adopting a causal response to the Gettier problem usually requires one to adopt (as Goldman gladly does) some form of reliabilism about justification.

====Lehrer–Paxson&#x27;s defeasibility condition====
Keith Lehrer and Thomas Paxson (1969) proposed another response, by adding a &quot;defeasibility condition&quot; to the JTB analysis. On their account, knowledge is &quot;undefeated justified true belief&quot;—which is to say that a justified true belief counts as knowledge if and only if it is also the case that there is no further truth that, had the subject known it, would have defeated their present justification for the belief. (Thus, for example, Smith&#x27;s justification for believing that the person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket is his justified belief that Jones will get the job, combined with his justified belief that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. But if Smith had known the truth that Jones will &quot;not&quot; get the job, that would have defeated the justification for his belief.)

====Pragmatism====
Pragmatism was developed as a philosophical doctrine by C.S.Peirce and William James (1842–1910). In Peirce&#x27;s view, the truth is nominally defined as a sign&#x27;s correspondence to its object and pragmatically defined as the ideal final opinion to which sufficient investigation &quot;would&quot; lead sooner or later. James&#x27; epistemological model of truth was that which &quot;works&quot; in the way of belief, and a belief was true if in the long run it &quot;worked&quot; for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world. Peirce argued that metaphysics could be cleaned up by a pragmatic approach.
Consider what effects that might &quot;conceivably&quot; have practical bearings you &quot;conceive&quot; the objects of your &quot;conception&quot; to have. Then, your &quot;conception&quot; of those effects is the whole of your &quot;conception&quot; of the object.
From a pragmatic viewpoint of the kind often ascribed to James, defining on a particular occasion whether a particular belief can rightly be said to be both true and justified is seen as no more than an exercise in pedantry, but being able to discern whether that belief led to fruitful outcomes is a fruitful enterprise. Peirce emphasized fallibilism, considered the assertion of absolute certainty a barrier to inquiry, and in 1901 defined truth as follows: &quot;Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.&quot; In other words, any unqualified assertion is likely to be at least a little wrong or, if right, still right for not entirely the right reasons. Therefore, one is more veracious by being Socratic, including recognition of one&#x27;s own ignorance and knowing one may be proved wrong. This is the case, even though in practical matters one sometimes must act, if one is to act at all, with a decision and complete confidence.

===Revisions of JTB approaches===
The difficulties involved in producing a viable fourth condition have led to claims that attempting to repair the JTB account is a deficient strategy. For example, one might argue that what the Gettier problem shows is not the need for a fourth independent condition in addition to the original three, but rather that the attempt to build up an account of knowledge by conjoining a set of independent conditions was misguided from the outset. Those who have adopted this approach generally argue that epistemological terms like justification, evidence, certainty, etc. should be analyzed in terms of a primitive notion of &quot;knowledge,&quot; rather than vice versa. Knowledge is understood as &quot;factive,&quot; that is, as embodying a sort of epistemological &quot;tie&quot; between a truth and a belief. The JTB account is then criticized for trying to get and encapsulate the factivity of knowledge &quot;on the cheap&quot;, as it were, or via a circular argument, by replacing an irreducible notion of factivity with the conjunction of some of the properties that accompany it (in particular, truth and justification). Of course, the introduction of irreducible primitives into a philosophical theory is always problematical (some would say a sign of desperation), and such anti-reductionist accounts are unlikely to please those who have other reasons to hold fast to the method behind JTB+G accounts.

==== Fred Dretske&#x27;s conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick&#x27;s truth-tracking ====
Fred Dretske developed an account of knowledge which he called &quot;conclusive reasons&quot;, revived by Robert Nozick as what he called the &quot;subjunctive&quot; or truth-tracking account. Nozick&#x27;s formulation posits that proposition p is an instance of knowledge when:

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S would believe that p
#if p weren&#x27;t true, S wouldn&#x27;t believe that p

Nozick&#x27;s definition is intended to preserve Goldman&#x27;s intuition that Gettier cases should be ruled out by disacknowledging &quot;accidentally&quot; true justified beliefs, but without risking the potentially onerous consequences of building a causal requirement into the analysis. This tactic though, invites the riposte that Nozick&#x27;s account merely hides the problem and does not solve it, for it leaves open the question of &quot;why&quot; Smith would not have had his belief if it had been false. The most promising answer seems to be that it is because Smith&#x27;s belief was &quot;caused&quot; by the truth of what he believes; but that puts us back in the causalist camp.

Criticisms and counter examples (notably the &quot;Grandma case&quot;) prompted a revision, which resulted in the alteration of (3) and (4) to limit themselves to the same method (i.e. vision):

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S &quot;(using M)&quot; would believe that p
#if p weren&#x27;t true, S &quot;(using method M)&quot; wouldn&#x27;t believe that p

Saul Kripke has pointed out that this view remains problematic and uses a counterexample called the &quot;Fake Barn Country example&quot;, which describes a certain locality containing a number of fake barns or facades of barns. In the midst of these fake barns is one real barn, which is painted red. There is one more piece of crucial information for this example - the fake barns cannot be painted red.

Jones is driving along the highway, looks up and happens to see the real barn, and so forms the belief:

*I see a barn.

Though Jones has gotten lucky, he could have just as easily been deceived and not have known it. Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t fulfill premise 4, for if Jones saw a fake barn he wouldn&#x27;t have any idea it was a fake barn. So this is not knowledge.

An alternate example is if Jones looks up and forms the belief:

*I see a red barn.

According to Nozick&#x27;s view this fulfills all four premises. Therefore, this is knowledge, since Jones couldn&#x27;t have been wrong, since the fake barns cannot be painted red. This is a troubling account however, since it seems the first statement &quot;I see a barn&quot; can be inferred from &quot;I see a red barn&quot;; however by Nozick&#x27;s view the first belief is &quot;not&quot; knowledge and the second is knowledge.

===Robert Fogelin&#x27;s perspectival account===
In the first chapter of his book &quot;Pyrronian Reflexions on Truth and Justification&quot;, Robert Fogelin gives a diagnosis that leads to a dialogical solution to Gettier&#x27;s problem. The problem always arises when the given justification has nothing to do with what really makes the proposition true. Now, he notes that in such cases there is always a mismatch between the information available to the person who makes the knowledge-claim of some proposition p and the information available to the evaluator of this knowledge-claim (even if the evaluator is the same person in a later time). A Gettierian counterexample arises when the justification given by the person who makes the knowledge-claim cannot be accepted by the knowledge evaluator because it does not fit with his wider informational setting. For instance, in the case of the fake barn the evaluator knows that a superficial inspection from someone who does not know the peculiar circumstances involved isn&#x27;t a justification acceptable as making the proposition p (that it is a real barn) true.
====Richard Kirkham&#x27;s skepticism====

Richard Kirkham has proposed that it is best to start with a definition of knowledge so strong that giving a counterexample to it is logically impossible. Whether it can be weakened without becoming subject to a counterexample should then be checked. He concludes that there will always be a counterexample to any definition of knowledge in which the believer&#x27;s evidence does not logically necessitate the belief. Since in most cases the believer&#x27;s evidence does not necessitate a belief, Kirkham embraces skepticism about knowledge; but he notes that a belief can still be rational even if it is not an item of knowledge.

===Attempts to dissolve the problem===
One might respond to Gettier by finding a way to avoid his conclusion(s) in the first place. However, it can hardly be argued that knowledge is justified true belief if there are cases that are justified true belief without being knowledge; thus, those who want to avoid Gettier&#x27;s conclusions have to find some way to defuse Gettier&#x27;s counterexamples. In order to do so, within the parameters of the particular counter-example or , they must then either accept that

# Gettier&#x27;s cases are not really cases of justified true belief, or
# Gettier&#x27;s cases really are cases of knowledge after all,

or, demonstrate a case in which it is possible to circumvent surrender to the exemplar by eliminating any necessity for it to be considered that JTB apply in just those areas that Gettier has rendered obscure, without thereby lessening the force of JTB to apply in those cases where it actually is crucial. Then, though Gettier&#x27;s cases &quot;stipulate&quot; that Smith has a certain belief and that his belief is true, it seems that in order to propose (1), one must argue that Gettier, (or, that is, the writer responsible for the particular form of words on this present occasion known as case (1), and who makes assertion&#x27;s about Smith&#x27;s &quot;putative&quot; beliefs), goes wrong because he has the wrong notion of &quot;justification.&quot; Such an argument often depends on an externalist account on which &quot;justification&quot; is understood in such a way that whether or not a belief is &quot;justified&quot; depends not just on the internal state of the believer, but also on how that internal state is related to the outside world. Externalist accounts typically are constructed such that Smith&#x27;s putative beliefs in Case I and Case II are not really justified (even though it seems to Smith that they are), because his beliefs are not lined up with the world in the right way, or that it is possible to show that it is invalid to assert that &quot;Smith&quot; has any significant &quot;particular&quot; belief at all, in terms of JTB or otherwise. Such accounts, of course, face the same burden as causalist responses to Gettier: they have to explain what sort of relationship between the world and the believer counts as a justificatory relationship.

Those who accept (2) are by far in the minority in analytic philosophy; generally, those who are willing to accept it are those who have independent reasons to say that more things count as knowledge than the intuitions that led to the JTB account would acknowledge. Chief among these is epistemic minimalists, Crispin Sartwell, who hold that all true belief, including both Gettier&#x27;s cases and lucky guesses, counts as knowledge.

===Experimental research===
Some early work in the field of experimental philosophy suggested that traditional intuitions about Gettier cases might vary cross-culturally. However, subsequent studies have consistently failed to replicate these results, instead finding that participants from different cultures do share the traditional intuition. More recent studies have been providing evidence for the opposite hypothesis, that people from a variety of different cultures have similar intuitions in these cases.

<text>The gens Gavia, or occasionally Gabia, was a Roman family of plebeian descent. It first appears in history during the first century BC, but none of its members obtained any of the curule magistracies until imperial times. The Gavi Arch at Verona was built in honor of one of the Gavii.

==Origin==
As a nomen, &quot;Gavius&quot; is a patronymic surname, derived from the praenomen &quot;Gavius&quot;. In historical times, this praenomen was used by the Oscan-speaking peoples of central and southern Italy, suggesting that the Gavii were originally of Sabine or Samnite origin; one of the most famous persons with this praenomen was Gavius Pontius, a Samnite general during the Second Samnite War.

But as with other patronymic surnames, there may originally have been several unrelated families bearing the same nomen, and some of these could also have been of Latin origin; &quot;Gavius&quot; is thought to be the original form of &quot;Gaius&quot;, one of the most common praenomina in every period of Roman history. That name is derived from an ancient root meaning &quot;to rejoice&quot;. As it is impossible to distinguish between different families of Gavii with absolute certainty, all persons bearing this nomen are collected here.

==Members==
* Publius Gavius, an inhabitant of Cosa, whom Verres had crucified, on suspicion of aiding Spartacus.
* Titus Gavius Caepio, described by Cicero as a wealthy aristocrat. During the Civil War, his son was a military tribune under Bibulus in Syria.
* Lucius Gavius, an agent of Brutus in Cappadocia when Cicero was proconsul of Cilicia, from 51 to 50 BC. At Brutus&#x27; request, Cicero offered Gavius a prefecture, but found him very disrespectful, and referred to him as Clodius&#x27; dog. He may be the same person as the Gavius of Firmum previously mentioned by Cicero.
* Gavius Bassus, a Latin grammarian in the time of Cicero.
* Gavius Silo, an orator heard by Augustus in 26 BC, according to Seneca the Elder.
* Gaius Gavius C. f. Macer, quaestor in AD 19.
* Marcus Gavius (or Gabius) Apicius, a celebrated gourmand during the reign of Tiberius, he squandered his fortune in the pursuit of new culinary horizons, and became the subject of numerous anecdotes and proverbs.
* Gavius or Gabius Bassus, a grammarian, whose &quot;Commentarii&quot; and &quot;Origine Verborum et Vocabulorum&quot; were cited by Aulus Gellius. He is probably the same Gavius who was the author of &quot;De Diis&quot;, discussed by Macrobius, and may have authored the &quot;Satirae&quot; quoted by Fabius Planciades Fulgentius.
* Marcus Gavius P. f. Bassus, prefect of the Pontic coast during the reign of Trajan. Although sometimes identified with the grammarian, he is unlikely to have been the same person, as the grammarian related having seen the horse Sejanus, which had belonged to Publius Cornelius Dolabella, Gaius Cassius Longinus, and Marcus Antonius, a century and a half earlier.
* Gaius Gavius Silvanus, tribune under Nero.
* Quintus Gavius Atticus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 73.
* Marcus Gavius Squilla Gallicanus, consul in AD 127, was the father of Gallicanus and Orfitus, consuls in AD 150 and 165.
* Marcus Gavius M. f. Squilla Gallicanus, consul in AD 150.
* Marcus Gavius Maximus, Praetorian prefect under Antoninus Pius.
* Marcus Gavius M. f. Orfitus, consul in AD 165.
* Marcus Gavius M. f. Cornelius Cethegus, consul in AD 170.
* Marcus Gavius Appalius Maximus, governor of Lycia et Pamphylia from about 182 to 184.
* Lucius Fulvius Gavius Numisius Petronius Aemilianus, consul in AD 206.
* Lucius Fulvius Gavius Numisius Aemilianus, consul in AD 249.

<text>The term superhuman refers to humans, humanoids or other beings with abilities and other qualities that exceed those naturally found in humans. These qualities may be acquired through natural ability, self-actualization or technological aids. The related concept of a super race refers to an entire category of beings with the same or varying superhuman characteristics, created from present-day human beings by deploying various means such as eugenics, euthenics, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and/or brain–computer interfacing to accelerate the process of human evolution. 

Throughout history, the discussion of superhuman traits and the idea of the ideal human in physical, mental, or spiritual form has influenced politics, policy, philosophy, science and various social movements, as well as featuring prominently in culture. Groups advocating the deliberate pursuit of superhuman qualities for philosophical, political, or moral reasons are sometimes referred to as superhumanist.

Modern depictions of this have evolved and are shown in superhero fiction or through technologically aided people or cyborgs.

==In philosophy==

===Nietzsche===
The &quot;Übermensch&quot; or &quot;Superman&quot; was postulated in the later writings of Friedrich Nietzsche as a type of supreme, ultra-aristocratic achievement which becomes possible in the transcendence of modernity, morals or nihilism. Nietzsche believed in creating the perfect human, or at least a definition of one, and achieving this perfection through the enhancement of individual and cultural health, creativity, and power, and that to be a successful human one would focus on the realities of our world, rather than the beyond world, or afterlife.

Nietzsche explores the idea of a superhuman in his work &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, in which he discusses the reality of humans existing as just that, and their potential to be more, through risks taken to advance humanity. This belief focuses not on a man who is bettering oneself but instead establishes values which create a meaning to life greater than one person, and positively influencing the lives of others with an overarching goal of humanity. These goals help one overcome life&#x27;s feeling of meaninglessness.

===Transhumanism===
In transhumanism and futurology, superhuman abilities are the technological aim either of human enhancement by genetic modification or cybernetic implants or of future superhuman artificial intelligence.

Human enhancement is an attempt to temporarily or permanently overcome the current limitations of the human body through natural or artificial means. Human enhancement may be through the use of technological means to select or alter human characteristics and capacities, whether or not the alteration results in characteristics and capacities that lie beyond the existing human range.

Some bioethicists restrict the term to the non-therapeutic application of specific technologies—neuro-, cyber-, gene- and nano-technologies—to human biology.

According to transhumanist thinkers, a posthuman is a hypothetical future being &quot;whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously human by our current standards.&quot;

Fictionalized accounts of transhumanism include the characters from the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise and cyborgs such as those found in the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; franchise.

====Ray Kurzweil====
In 2005, the inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that over a 40-year period between 2005 and 2045, most human beings will gradually evolve into a super race of immortal cyborgs called &quot;Transhumans&quot; with super-bodies and super-brains (the super brains of the humanoid androids will have greater capacity not only in and of themselves, but also because they will be able to function more efficiently by storing some of their mental capacity in the cloud of the future greatly expanded Internet through brain–computer interfacing) by gradually replacing their biological cells with new cells having a more efficient cellular energy processing system that will be based on nanobots manufactured using nanotechnology. These nanobot based cells will enable those who possess these initially quasi android bodies (&quot;Human body 2.0&quot;) to have much greater physical endurance as if they were permanently on steroids, and many Olympic records will be routinely broken. The five senses will be enhanced first by genetic enhancement and then by additional brain–computer interfacing. By about 2040, most humans will have become fully android (&quot;Human body 3.0&quot;).

Finally, predicts Kurzweil, by 2045, because of the operation of Moore&#x27;s law, supercomputers linked together by the Internet will have developed enough memory capacity such that most of the now mostly android human race (except those who do not want to) will be able to upload themselves into the worldwide Internet supercomputer of 2045 and live forever after in virtual reality—an event he calls the &quot;Singularity&quot;.

Kurzweil predicts that soon after the &quot;Singularity&quot;, the worldwide supercomputer will deploy other humanoid androids and robots in the meat world. A space navy of these androids and robots will radiate outward from Earth (by now itself a gigantic worldwide supercomputer, except for extensive areas of the surface of Earth set up as nature reserves for those humans who wanted to remain in their natural state as well as to preserve the plants and animals in their natural ecosystems) on large fleets of interplanetary spaceships that will rocket outward into the solar system and convert all the matter they encounter into megacomputers made of computronium (such as Jupiter Brains) in order to continually expand the computer capacity of the solar system and thus create ever more realistic virtual reality and solve ever more complex computer problems. Once the matter of the solar system has been mostly converted to computer substrate, forming a Matrioshka brain, according to Kurzweil, by about the beginning of the 22nd century, life will then expand outward into interstellar space in all directions, deploying miniature starships (to save on expensive anti matter starship fuel) that will be Von Neumann probes crewed by swarms of nanobots, to colonize the entire Milky Way Galaxy. When these nanobots arrive in a planetary system, the nanobots will be programmed with software to begin converting some of the matter they encounter into more androids and robots. While in the process of doing so, they will continue converting all other matter they encounter not being used to create additional androids and robots into more megacomputers—the androids and robots created by the nanobots will build interplanetary spaceships to fan out into the planetary system and themselves help get this job done. Some of the androids and robots will then settle down in the meat world as immortal colonists on the surfaces of the Matrioshka brains thus constructed (regularly making backup copies of the contents of their brains so they can be reconstructed if they are killed in an accident), while others will upload themselves into the virtual reality based on these Matrioshka brains, keeping their bodies in cryonic storage. Eventually, the entire Galaxy, then the Local group, then the Virgo Supercluster, then the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex and ultimately the entire Universe will be turned into a gigantic megacomputer.

===Artificial intelligence===

&quot;Superhuman&quot; is one of the stages in classification of progress in artificial intelligence where an entity of artificial intelligence performs better than most humans do in a specific task. Examples of where computers have achieved superhuman performance include Backgammon, Bridge, Chess, Reversi, Scrabble, Go and Jeopardy!.

===Anarchist philosophy===
It is suggested that there is a relationship between the fall of a society and the perfection of mankind. Many economic, social and environmental factors, which all contribute to the sustainability of a society, are built upon the need for a solution to a problem. Superhumanism requires the ability to overcome these problems, either through physical, mental or emotional triumphs of purity and self-actualization. Through the elimination of these problems, many economies and social structures would be collapsed. Also, through advancement in areas such as Transhumanism, some believe that people humans will advance to a point of education and readiness that war will break out between one another, or tyrannies will reign, due to the high levels of advancements being achieved hence correlating with a need for power, eventually leading to an ultimate state of anarchy.

===Religious connotations===
As a major defining factor of the superhumanism philosophy, humans are expected to possess traits that are considered to be those of high moral grounds, dignity and intrinsic values. Many people who believe in superhumanism value the importance of independent responsibility in making the world a better, and more moral place. This often means being in, or establishing some sort of spirituality which allows one to follow guidelines and grounds of a moral structure, and achieve a certain level of clarity and purity in their self and their path to righteousness and betterment. Superhumanism is often referred to as a combination between religion and philosophy, which suggests that there should be a correlation between the actions of man, and the patterns of the earth, in which this unity established with God, nature and man can allow for super human feats to become possible.

==In history==

===Nazi Germany===

The Nietzschean notion of bettering one&#x27;s self as an individual was expanded within the philosophy of Nazism to apply to whole groups and nations. Nazi racialist thinkers proposed perfecting the Aryan race through controlled breeding and coercive eugenics (including the murder of those deemed unfit) as a way of improving their racial stock and purifying their society. They intended to create a &quot;herrenvolk&quot; (race of masters) wherein the Germanic &quot;Übermenschen&quot; would rule over so-called inferior &quot;untermenschen&quot; such as Slavs and West Asians.

====Neo-Nazism: Homo Galactica====
The Neo-Nazi David Myatt advocated in the early 1990s that after the &quot;Western Imperium&quot;, a proposed future autocratic state governing all the areas inhabited by the Aryan race, is established, and the birth rate of the Aryan race is brought up from its present level of about 1.6 to a replacement rate of 2.1, that then a new super-race called &quot;Homo Galactica&quot; should be created by genetic engineering from the most perfect Aryans, which by then will have themselves been improved through genetic enhancement. This new super race would be genetically engineered to have super brains, super senses, and more delicate hands to be able to travel in starships, which would be sent out to colonize the entire Milky Way Galaxy with the descendants of Aryans.

==Real life examples==

===Athletics===
Many acts performed by elite athletes are seen as superhuman. Elite athletes perform at a level that is perceived as unattainable by normal standards of performance. These are the result of a mixture of performance enhancing drugs, genetics, physical training, and mental conditioning. For example, the highest VO2 max test results ever recorded were from Norwegian cross-country skier, Bjorn Daehlie, who scored a 96 ml/kg/min. Another man, Dean Karnazes ran 50 marathons in 50 days in all 50 states in the United States in 2006. On February 4, 2015 actor and power lifter Hafthor Bjornsson broke a 1000-year-old record by carrying a 650 kilogram (1,433 pound) log on his back for 5 steps.

Outside of athletics, many people have performed superhuman feats. The Blue Angels flight acrobatics team regularly pulls maneuvers equal to 4–6 times the force of gravity (g), with some turns as high as 8g. One man, Greg Poe, is a pilot who was able withstand turns of 12g.

There are also many stories of people lifting extremely heavy objects under extreme stress, known as hysterical strength. These situations are created when abnormal tasks are completed due to the brain&#x27;s heightened need for achievement.

===Science===
One modern day method of achieving above average abilities include performance-enhancing drugs; these include substances such as painkillers, blood boosters, stimulants, and anabolic steroids, but can also encompass substances that are not fully recognized as enhancers such as caffeine, protein supplements, and vitamins. While drugs as a form of achieving superhuman capabilities is a well known concept in fiction, such as films like &quot;Limitless&quot; and the Marvel Comics character Nuke, in real life the current substances that are known and available do not produce such fantastical abilities. The results from some of these drugs are minimal, and often short term. However, they can still produce detrimental side effects, including many adverse psychological effects. SARMS and DMAA are safer forms to enhance physical performance. Other forms of enhancement include strengthening the material properties of bone by integrating it with titanium foam. More studies are needed to assess the long term effects of these emerging technologies.

Technology can also be used to improve on human sensory and communication abilities as has been shown through experimentation with nervous system implants. In this way humans can take on senses such as ultrasonics for an accurate indication of distance and communicate much more directly between brains.

==In popular culture==
===Fiction===
Speculation about human nature and the possibilities of both human enhancement and future human evolution have made superhumans a popular subject of science fiction. Superhuman abilities are also associated with superhero fiction.

===Art===
In 1979, the British artist Nicholas Treadwell wrote a book entitled &quot;Superhumanism&quot;, followed by &quot;Superhumanism 2&quot; in 1982. Treadwell defined his movement as &quot;the first people&#x27;s art movement—a movement, first and foremost, inspired by life, as opposed to inspired by art. It is a movement of art by the people, for the people, and about the people. It is about tolerance and human understanding. Initially, a superhumanist work will move you to feel—to laugh, to cry, to shudder, to be overwhelmed with compassion. They do not include any aesthetic gesture to distract from the vivid nature of the image. A superhumanist work will take a down to earth subject, and use original technical means to exaggerate it, achieving an over-the-top impact of its humanist theme&quot;. Treadwell used this art movement to emphasize the connection between mundane nature of humans, and the superior characteristics that exist in that simplicity.

===Documentaries===
&quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Superhumans&quot; was a television show devoted to finding people around the world who exhibit abilities that exceed normal human capabilities. Daniel Browning Smith, the most flexible man in the world, is an example of a superhuman who travels the world finding physical and mental feats that expand the realm of what humans can do.

&quot;Human Body: Pushing the Limits&quot; is a Discovery Channel show that explains what happens to people&#x27;s strength, sight, brainpower, and sensing abilities when placed under extreme stress. These circumstances can lead to short-term superhuman abilities, which allow people to excel in advanced, or impossible tasks.

&quot;How to Be Superhuman&quot; is a podcast series by Red Bull about people who have gone close to the limits of human endurance. The host Rob Pope, who was described as the &quot;real life Forrest Gump&quot; after running across the United States five times, interviews people who have achieved &quot;superhuman&quot; feats, such as Mark Beaumont, who cycled around the world in 78 days, and Diana Nyad, who completed a 110-mile swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage at the age of 64.
