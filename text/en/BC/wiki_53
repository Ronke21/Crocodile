<text>John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu (c. 1431 – 14 April 1471) was a major magnate of fifteenth-century England. He was a younger son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and the younger brother of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;.

From an early age, he was involved in fighting for his House, particularly in the feud that sprang up in the 1450s with the Neville family&#x27;s major regional rivals, the Percy family. John Neville was personally responsible for much of the violence until, with his brothers, they defeated and imprisoned their enemies. This was taking place against the backdrop of a crisis in central government. The king, Henry VI, already known to be a weak ruler, suffered a mental collapse which led to a protectorate headed by John&#x27;s uncle, Richard, Duke of York. Within two years an armed conflict had broken out, with York openly in rebellion against the king, and his Neville cousins supporting him. John fought with his father and Warwick against the king at the first Battle of St Albans, at which they had the victory.

Following a few years of uneasy peace, the Yorkists&#x27; rebellion erupted once again, and John Neville fought alongside his father and elder brother Thomas at the Battle of Blore Heath in September 1459. Although the Earl of Salisbury fought off the Lancastrians, both his sons were captured, and John, with Thomas, spent the next year imprisoned. Following his release in 1460, he took part in the Yorkist government. His father and brother died in battle just after Christmas 1460, and in February the next year, John – now promoted to the peerage as Lord Montagu – and Warwick fought the Lancastrians again at St Albans. John was once again captured and not released until his cousin Edward, York&#x27;s son, won a decisive victory at Towton in March 1461, and became King Edward IV.

John Neville soon emerged, with Warwick, as representatives of the king&#x27;s power in the north, which was still politically turbulent, as there were still a large number of Lancastrians on the loose attempting to raise a rebellion against the new regime. As his brother Warwick became more involved in national politics and central government, it devolved to John to finally defeat the last remnants of Lancastrians in 1464. Following these victories, Montagu, in what has been described as a high point for his House, was created Earl of Northumberland. At around the same time, however, his brother Warwick became increasingly dissatisfied with his relationship with the king, and began instigating rebellions against Edward IV in the north, finally capturing him in July 1469. At first, Montagu helped suppress this discontent, and also encouraged Warwick to release Edward. Eventually, however, his brother went into French exile with the king&#x27;s brother George, Duke of Clarence, in March 1470.

During Warwick&#x27;s exile, King Edward stripped Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, making him Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville appears to have seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained about the lack of landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a &quot;pie&#x27;s nest&quot;. When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king&#x27;s name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy.

While in exile, Warwick had allied with the old king, Henry VI and his Queen, Margaret of Anjou, Henry was restored to the throne, and Warwick now effectively ruled the kingdom, This return to Lancastrianism did not, however, last long; within the year, Edward and Gloucester had returned. Landing only a few miles from Montagu in Yorkshire – who did nothing to stop them – the Yorkists marched south, raising an army. Montagu followed them, and, meeting up with his brother at Coventry, they confronted Edward over a battlefield at Barnet. John Neville was cut down in the fighting, Warwick died soon after, and within a month Edward had reclaimed his throne and Henry VI and his line was extinguished.

==Youth and early career==
Montagu was the third son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury, and a younger brother of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, &quot;the Kingmaker.&quot;

John Neville&#x27;s upbringing and career was entwined with that of the north of England and specifically, the marcher areas, the eastern and western borders between Scotland and England, controlled from Berwick and Carlisle respectively. His early activity there consisted of diplomatic meetings with the Scots, at which he acted as a witness, between 1449 and 1451. He was also one of three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border. He was knighted by King Henry VI at Greenwich on 5 January 1453, alongside Edmund and Jasper Tudor, his brother Thomas Neville, William Herbert, Roger Lewknor, and William Catesby.
=== Feud with the Percys ===

Sir John Neville was from the branch of the Neville family based at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, rather than that of Westmorland. It has been claimed that he, as a &quot;landless younger son&quot; was partially to blame for his family&#x27;s long-running feud with the Lancastrian Percy family of Northumberland. The first outburst of violence that took place was a result of the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville&#x27;s brother, Thomas Neville to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of this must have reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s younger sons, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, began recruiting men. In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of Topcliffe, possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont. Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy tenantry who were in residence. He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the Royal Council, a summons which was ignored by both. Feuding continued through summer 1453, and even though they had been instructed to keep the peace, by 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons. In Knaresborough, the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of Sir William Plumpton (the king&#x27;s man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a &quot;show of force&quot; in January 1454.

John Neville was with his brother&#x27;s wedding party when Egremont ambushed them on the return from Tattershall Castle. This took place on Heworth Moor on 24 August 1453. The next month, John took a raiding party and ransacked Egremont&#x27;s Catton manor, &quot;breaking windows and shattering tiles.&quot; With his brothers, Thomas and Richard, as well as the Earl of Salisbury, they faced the Earl of Northumberland and his sons at Topcliffe on 20 October 1453, although a peace was then negotiated. The feud continued for much of the next year, and only came to a halt with a battle at Salisbury&#x27;s manor of Stamford Bridge, near York on 31 October 1454. Thomas and John confronted, and decisively beat, Egremont and Richard Percy, whom the Nevilles captured.

== Marriage ==

John Neville married Isabel Ingoldsthorpe (c.1441 – 20 May 1476), of Burrough Green and Sawston, Cambridgeshire, on 25 April 1457; Archbishop Thomas Bourchier officiated the marriage at Canterbury Cathedral. Isabel was not only the heiress of her father, Sir Edmund Ingoldsthorpe (who had died on 2 September 1456), but also the heiress of her maternal uncle, John Tiptoft and his Earldom of Worcester. It may have been that Earl of Worcester had engineered the match. A letter to John Paston on 1 May 1457 described how &quot;the Erle [of Warwick&#x27;s] yonger broþere maryed to Ser Edmund Ynglthorp&#x27;s doughter upon Seynt Markes Day; the Erle of Worcestre broght aboute the maryage.&quot; She was a greater heiress than might have been expected for a youngest son like John. John was granted seven southern manors by his father and mother, the Earl and Countess of Salisbury, for his part.

John Neville&#x27;s marriage caused a dispute with Queen Margaret: even though Isabel was over fourteen years old (and therefore of legal age), the Queen claimed that Isabel was still her ward. As a result, Queen Margaret insisted that John pay her a fine for his marriage to Isabel: he was bound to pay her £1,000 in ten instalments.

== Wars of the Roses ==

The king had become incapacitated in August 1453, which had led to the Duke of York being appointed protector and controlling the government. By Christmas of 1454, however, King Henry had recovered from his illness, which removed the basis for York&#x27;s authority. Having reconvened the court at Westminster by mid-April 1455, Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at Leicester. York and the Nevilles anticipated that Somerset would bring charges against them at this assembly. John Neville included, they gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at St Albans.

Although only a small affray, it resulted in the deaths of some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, while Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York&#x27;s redistribution of Skipwith&#x27;s ex-offices.

In December 1456, the new Duke of Somerset tried to attack John Neville in London&#x27;s Cheapside; Somerset had already attempted something similar to John&#x27;s brother Warwick the previous month. John&#x27;s encounter, reported contemporary chroniclers, would have become a &quot;skirmish&quot; if the mayor had not intervened. As it had been John who had &quot;spearheaded&quot; the Neville retaliation to the Percies during their feud, Salisbury entered into a bond for Thomas and John&#x27;s behaviour on 23 March 1458. John, however, continued to receive commissions from the government. He was part of a delegation of twenty-two Ambassadors nominated to discuss breaches of the Truce with Burgundy on 14 May that year, and two months later he was investigating the murder of a royal serjeant. In 1459, he was appointed steward of the Honour of Pontefract.

Reconciliation between the crown and the sons of the dead lords of St Albans on the one half and of York and his Neville allies did not last, however. In mid-September 1459, the Earl of Salisbury, intending to meet York at the latter&#x27;s castle at Ludlow, marched south from Middleham Castle with his household, retainers, and a force of around five-thousand men. John and Thomas were with him. Salisbury&#x27;s force was engaged by a much larger royal army under the command of Lord Audley on 23 September at Blore Heath, near Mucklestone, Staffordshire. Even though he had numerical superiority the result was a defeat for Audley, who was killed. However at some point John Neville – along with his brother Thomas and their father&#x27;s retainer James Harrington were captured. This might have occurred in their pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians the next day or alternatively they may have been injured in battle and had been sent home. Either way, captured at Acton Bridge near Tarporley, Cheshire, the four were imprisoned in Chester Castle.

John Neville was not released until July 1460. As a result, he was not present at the Yorkists&#x27; rout at the Battle of Ludford Bridge, which resulted in his father and brother&#x27;s exile in Calais. He had still been attainted at the Parliament of Devils in October 1459 and only restored in August the next year. He was not released until June that year, and remained in London during York&#x27;s return from exile, and his claiming of the throne. On 1 November 1460, York appointed John the king&#x27;s Chamberlain for a crown-wearing ceremony at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He stayed in London as word arrived that Lancastrians were gathering an army in the north; York, Salisbury, and John&#x27;s brother Thomas marched north to confront them. On 30 December 1460, they went down to a crushing defeat outside York&#x27;s castle at Sandal, at the Battle of Wakefield where York and Thomas were killed, and Salisbury captured and beheaded the next day.

John Neville appears to have been Lieutenant of the castle of Calais, while Warwick served as its Captain. During the Protector&#x27;s absence that winter, and after York&#x27;s and Salisbury&#x27;s death, alongside his brothers Warwick and George (the Chancellor) Neville was part of the head of government.

== Elevation to the peerage and war in the north ==
According to Benet&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, John Neville was elevated to the peerage as Lord Montagu in the January 1461 parliament. It was also at this parliament that he presented a petition, regarding his wife, in which he reiterated that in common law women receive livery of their lands at fourteen years of age, and he requested parliament to reaffirm this. In February he was elected to the Order of the Garter. He was installed on 21 March 1462, when he took his father&#x27;s choir stall in Windsor Castle&#x27;s St. George&#x27;s Chapel.

By February 1461 Queen Margaret&#x27;s army was marching south. Warwick and John, with their &quot;frantically raised&quot; army, collected the King and marched north to confront the Queen&#x27;s army on the Great North Road. The two armies met on 17 February at the Second Battle of St Albans – this time, just outside the town. In the resulting encounter, Warwick was &quot;outflanked and now outmatched,&quot; whereas John seems to have kept his army together up until the point the King&#x27;s person was regained by the Lancastrians. Montagu commanded the left flank of the Yorkist army, which itself was subdivided into a group of archers in the town itself, with the majority posted on Bernards Heath, stretching eastwards towards Warwick&#x27;s vanguard. This &quot;bloody and bitter encounter&quot; saw Warwick and John&#x27;s army defeated. The Earl escaped; Montagu was captured and sent to York Castle.

It seems probable that he escaped execution after the battle because, as the Milanese Ambassador wrote, &quot;a brother of my lord of Somerset is a prisoner [of Warwick&#x27;s] at Calais.&quot;

As a result of his capture and imprisonment in York, Montagu escaped participation in the biggest and probably bloodiest battle of the Wars of the Roses which took place on 29 March 1461 at Towton in Yorkshire. This decisive Yorkist victory led to Montagu being released the next day, when the son of the Duke of York – and England&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; new king – Edward IV entered York in triumph. Montagu and Warwick then stayed in the north to attempt the recapture of northern castles still in Lancastrian hands; as John Gillingham has put it, &quot;the unfinished military business would have to be left to the Nevilles.&quot; And on 10 May 1461 Montagu was commissioned to raise troops against both the Lancastrian remnants and the king of Scotland. One of Montagu&#x27;s first actions was to successfully raise the siege of Carlisle, &quot;with prompt action.&quot; Carlisle had had its suburbs burnt and been under siege from June by a Scottish-Lancastrian force, but was easily relieved by him, apparently killing 6,000 Scots and Lord Clifford&#x27;s brother in the process, before Warwick had even arrived.

The military campaign that followed was focused on the recapture of strategically vital castles on the Northumbrian border. Alnwick Castle was commanded by a shell keep, to which extra towers had been added, as well as to the curtain wall, with a solid barbican and gatehouse. Bamburgh Castle was on a high spur ridge with three baileys, a large keep, and fortified gateways. Dunstanburgh Castle stood on a dolerite spur which had the sheer drop of a cliff on one side. Montagu besieged Bamburgh, the most important of these northern bulwarks, due to its distance from London and proximity to Scotland. By 26 December 1462, when the garrison surrendered, they &quot;had been reduced to eating their horses.&quot;

Montagu joined Warwick in escorting the chariot of six horses in the funeral cortege conveying the mortal remains of their father and brother from Pontefract Castle to the family mausoleum at Bisham Abbey, on 14–15 February 1463. On 6 May he was appointed Warden of the Eastern March; Warwick was his counterpart on the western marches. Later that year, he led an expedition to Norham Castle, which had been besieged by the Scots for the previous eighteen days, and relieved it on 26 July; this was followed by a Chevauchée into Scotland which only ceased when Montagu&#x27;s force ran out of supplies.

=== Royal patronage ===
In the meantime though, John received the first royal patronage of the reign, being granted the royal gold and silver mines in Devon and Cornwall worth £110 annually, for life. This was followed by duty payments from York and Kingston upon Hull and manors belonging to the dead Lancastrian Viscount Beaumont. In June 1461 he received the wardship of Edward Tiptoft, the heir of John Tiptoft, during his minority, and also the lands of Lord Clifford (who had died at Ferrybridge in a sharp encounter the night before Towton). Professor A. J. Pollard has noted, ironically, that Neville &quot;had to earn his rewards.&quot; In 1462 he was appointed Steward of the Household of the Palatinate of Durham, for which he received around £40 a year. This was twice the salary his legally-trained and &quot;non-noble&quot; successors would receive from the Bishop in later years, and has been described as a &quot;unique post.&quot;

== Hexham and Hedgeley Moor ==
In spite of Montagu&#x27;s and Warwick&#x27;s northern successes in the years following Towton, a not-insubstantial Lancastrian army was still active in the area; it had been slowly re-taking castles, like Bamburgh, Langley, Norham, and Prudhoe Castles, between February and March 1464. This threatened Newcastle, a major Yorkist supply centre. Local Lancastrians were returning to their estates, such as the Cliffords, who regained their castle at Skipton Craven with no royal response, military or otherwise. They &quot;virtually controlled most of the country immediately south of the Scottish border&quot;, wrote Charles Ross, although very few local gentry directly supported them. The situation was severe enough that in April 1464 he was too occupied with the northern situation to travel to London, and was exempted from attending the Order of the Garter Chapter meeting on the 29th of the month. He has been described as the king&#x27;s &#x27;resident commander&#x27; in the north and a &quot;confident and aggressive commander.&quot;

In early 1464, the Lancastrians having coalesced in the East March, the ongoing peace negotiations with the Scots were moved from Newcastle to York. Montagu was sent to escort their embassy through now-unfriendly territory. On his way to pick them up at Norham, he only avoided an ambush near Newcastle, by a small force of eighty spear and bowmen under Sir Humphrey Neville, by changing his route.

The Scottish embassy he eventually collected at Norham had been delayed, and it was on the return journey that the Duke of Somerset with Lords Roos and Hungerford, Sir Richard Turnstall, and Sir Thomas Findern and the bulk of the Lancastrian army (approximately 5,000 men) ambushed Montagu at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April 1464. The assault failed, and left Sir Ralph Percy dead on the field.

Montagu, having delivered the Scottish embassy to Newcastle, left there on 14 May, either with Lords Greystoke and Willoughby or picking them up &quot;en route&quot; with other supporters, to seek out the Lancastrians. The next day, at Hexham – having crossed the Tyne &quot;either at Bulwell or Corbridge&quot; – he attacked the rebels in their camp which was on the south side of Devil&#x27;s Water river. Montagu, his army swelled with new recruits from Newcastle, and men raised by Montagu&#x27;s brother, the Archbishop of York, may have had up to 10,000 men. Leading his army &quot;forward at the charge,&quot; Montagu&#x27;s attack soon became a rout, with the Lancastrian army dissolving and attempting escape over the bridge. Lords Roos, Hungerford, Findern, and Tallboys survived the battle only to be executed, on Montagu&#x27;s order – and probably in his presence – with the Duke of Somerset in Newcastle. Following Hexham, Montagu ordered the largest number of beheadings the civil wars had yet seen.

===Earl of Northumberland===

In May 1464, Hexham, Langley and Bywell castles surrendered to Montagu. Eight days later, on 27 May, he was created Earl of Northumberland, while Henry Percy was imprisoned in the Tower. The Earldom gave an income of between £700 and £1,000 a year. This, wrote Cora L. Scofield, was his reward for his decisive victories, since the Crown &quot;had played no direct part in them.&quot; That summer Montagu recaptured the three Northumberland castles – Dunstanburgh, Alnwick, and Bamburgh – that had been previously lost. Later that year – the &quot;high watermark of his House, the zenith of the Nevilles&quot; – Montagu&#x27;s brother George was appointed Archbishop of York, with John his Treasurer at his enthronement feast. During the feast, John&#x27;s wife Isabel, sat at the children&#x27;s table, supervising Warwick&#x27;s two daughters and the young Duke of Gloucester.

== Later years ==
Following the final crushing of the Lancastrian resistance, Montagu&#x27;s role focussed on diplomacy and peacekeeping. In June 1465 he was commissioned to contract marriages &quot;between English and Scottish subjects&quot; as well as to treat for perpetual peace with Scotland, as a result of which, Montagu returned the captured Duke of Albany to Scotland, for which he was paid fifty marks. It was during this time (Hicks has suggested around January 1465) that Montagu and Lord Scales were requested by the Duke of Brittany to accompany a force of 3,000 Breton archers supplied by him, for the League of the Public Weal against Louis XI of France. However, due to commitments in the north with Warwick, Montagu ended up taking no part in this campaign.

In 1465 Montagu received the main grant of the Percy Earldom of Northumberland estates, and on 25 March the following year he was granted the constableships and honours of Knaresborough and Pontefract Castles, which Warwick and before him their father had previously held, and also the castles of Tickhill, Snaith, and Dunstanburgh. This was to repay his arrears in back wages from his Wardenship of the East March, from an indenture of 1 June 1463. On the same day he was made Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster (north of the Trent), and it was from the profits of the duchy that his wages were coming from, amounting to approximately £1,000.

===Warden of the Marches===
The Wardens were the military guardians of the border from the late fourteenth century, and their salaries made them the highest-paid among Crown officers, but this was inclusive of the cost of raising troops and maintaining defence. This has also been described as controlling &quot;private armies raised at the Crown&#x27;s expense.&quot; By the mid-fifteenth century, the Wardenship of the East March was the most important of the two northern marcher lordships. Marcher Wardens were granted the right to recruit by their being &quot;explicitly&quot; exempted from the 1468 Statute of Livery, which restrained- or attempted to restrain- retaining. Montagu, however, was allowed to continue retaining in times of peace as well as war. At this point Humphrey Neville was still on the run, and Montagu required troops to be raised on various occasions; in 1467, for example, Beverley sent him troops to deal with Humphrey&#x27;s resistance.

===Warwick&#x27;s rebellion===
In 1467, as part of his brother&#x27;s plan for a closer relationship with the French, John and Isabelle accompanied Warwick in escorting the French King&#x27;s envoys to Canterbury. However, by this time, it was being rumoured that Warwick was moving towards supporting the House of Lancaster, as a result of dissatisfaction over the king&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and his pursuit of an anti-French foreign policy. In 1469, Warwick organised Robin of Redesdale&#x27;s rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire and in July that year the king&#x27;s brother George, Duke of Clarence married Warwick&#x27;s daughter Isabelle while anchored off Calais; this was in direct defiance of the king&#x27;s own wishes. It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother&#x27;s machinations, and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position.

On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy had taken his oath of fealty to the King, and had been released from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to come down from the Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he &quot;allowed the leaders to escape ... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again&quot; at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time led by a Robin of Holderness, but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgcote on 24 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother&#x27;s rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London.

However, it was while Edward was in York that he ordered the rehabilitation of Henry Percy to his family Earldom on 25/27 March 1470. On the same day John was elevated to the Marquessate of Montagu, and now outranked his brother, an Earl, in the English peerage. Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had, and have even suggested that the king was &quot;walking a tightrope&quot; as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not. To compensate him for the loss of the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead Earl of Devon, and Montagu&#x27;s son, George was created Duke of Bedford. These were substantial estates, providing an income of at least £600 per annum. Montagu was to be the new regional magnate – as he had been in the north – to fill an existing power vacuum.

== Rebellion and death ==
Montagu, though, was not happy with the new arrangements, and King Edward has been held responsible for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy. Warkworth&#x27;s Chronicle describes him as condemning these grants to him as &quot;a [mag]pyes nest.&quot; Montagu had been on the Scottish border since at least January 1470. Following unrest in Lincolnshire and the subsequent Lincolnshire rebellion, the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he did at the Battle of Empingham. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at Doncaster. Warwick and Clarence&#x27;s involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion. The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put down these risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick and Clarence from Calais. On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy. Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that Warwick and Clarence had landed in Dartmouth.

At Doncaster, the king awaited Montagu, who was in the north raising a substantial force in Edward&#x27;s name. Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called &quot;decisive&quot;. The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to Bishop&#x27;s Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.

===Readeption of Henry VI===

On 3 October, with Edward IV in exile, Henry VI was released from the Tower and returned to the throne by Warwick. Almost immediately, Montagu was granted the wardship of the executed Earl of Worcester&#x27;s heir and estates, as well as of the young Lord Clifford. He was reappointed to the Wardenship of the East March, with its salary, on 22 October 1470.

However, Montagu did not profit from the new regime as he probably expected to. He did not regain the Earldom of Northumberland. Further, he lost some of the Courtney lands that had come with his Marquessate to the newly returned Earl of Devon. Montagu had no active role in government, and does not seem to have sat in Council, although he was appointed Chamberlain to the King&#x27;s Household. Although he was confirmed in command of the new King&#x27;s forces in the north and in possession of the manor of Wressle on 21 March 1471, he did not regain any other Percy estates. Indeed, it has been suggested that his loyalty might still have been suspected by the newly arrived Lancastrians: having been summoned to the November 1470 parliament, Polydor Virgil states that he had to apologise there for his prior support of Edward. Montagu even had to pay cash for the king&#x27;s pardon, which he only received after making a lengthy speech, declaring that he had only remained faithful to Edward out of fear.

Montagu, having responsibility for the defence of the north, received various commissions of array, which reflected the government&#x27;s knowledge that King Edward was equipping a Burgundian-backed fleet in order to re-invade. Montagu was to raise men from all across the north. On 14 March 1471, King Edward landed at Ravenspur, on the coast of Yorkshire; he had intended to land in East Anglia, but this had been established as being unsafe. Montagu, it has been suggested, could have &quot;snuffed out&quot; Edward&#x27;s army almost immediately had he moved fast enough. Montagu was in Pontefract Castle as Edward passed by (where even his castle bailiff deserted him for the returning king, taking the castle&#x27;s funds with him). Montagu&#x27;s army, composed of local militias, was probably in the region of several thousand men, between 6,000 and 7,000, and increased as he trailed Edward south. Montagu arrived at Coventry, where the Earl of Warwick was camped, in early April 1471; this was probably the day after Clarence had defected back to his brother Edward, and taken his army with him.

===Battle of Barnet Heath===

By 12 April 1471, Montagu, with his brother Warwick and the Duke of Exeter, the Earl of Oxford, and Viscount Beaumont were approaching London with their army.

Edward, having arrived in London on 11 April and been reunited with his queen, met Montagu and Warwick a few miles north of London, outside the village of Barnet. It is possible that he commanded a smaller army, perhaps of only 9,000 men, and probably no more than 14,000.

The battle on 14 April was a &quot;confused affair&quot; and fought in fog. It has been suggested that it was Montagu who persuaded Warwick to fight on foot at Barnet, leaving the horses tethered at the rear, in order to demonstrate their commitment to the cause by taking the same risks as the common soldier. Montagu probably controlled the central section of Warwick&#x27;s army, facing Edward&#x27;s own section, on the Great North Road from Barnet to St. Albans. Warkworth&#x27;s Chronicle states that Warwick had an army of 20,000 men and that the battle beginning at 0400, lasted until ten o&#x27;clock that morning. Contemporaries have favourably described Montagu&#x27;s martial skill at Barnet. Philippe de Commines called him &quot;a very courageous knight,&quot; and the Burgundian observer Jean de Waurin wrote that, in the thick of the fighting, Montagu was &quot;cutting off arms and heads like a hero of romance.&quot;

The Earl of Oxford, commanding the right wing of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford&#x27;s men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, &quot;disaster struck&quot;. In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward&#x27;s rear, he crashed into Montagu&#x27;s section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford&#x27;s men fought with Montagu&#x27;s. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford&#x27;s &quot;Streaming star&quot; banner as the king&#x27;s &quot;Sunne in splendour,&quot; and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.

At some point, possibly around this time, Montagu was killed; he was certainly dead before his brother. The &quot;Arrivall&quot; chronicler states this occurred &quot;in plain battle,&quot; and in the thick of the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed.

==Aftermath==
The bodies of Warwick and Montagu were laid out &quot;on the morrow after&quot; and &quot;openly shewed and naked&quot; in St. Paul&#x27;s, to prevent rumour stating that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses &quot;to be put in a cart ... to be laid in the church of Paul&#x27;s, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days&quot; before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.

==Issue==
By his wife Isabel Ingoldsthorpe (c.1441-1476), daughter and heiress of Sir Edmund Ingaldsthorpe (d.1456) of Burrough Green and Sawston, Cambridgeshire (who survived him and remarried, on 25 April 1472 (as his second wife), to Sir William Norreys of Yattendon), he had a son and five daughters: 
*George Neville, Duke of Bedford (c. 1461–1483), eldest son and heir. It appears that Montagu had wanted to marry George to Anne Holland, heiress of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter; however by 1466 she had already married Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset . He died without issue, having been stripped of his dukedom in 1478. 
*Anne Neville, eldest daughter, who married Sir William Stonor of Stonor in Pyrton, Oxfordshire, a grandson of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk. 
*Elizabeth Neville, who married firstly Thomas Scrope, 6th Baron Scrope of Masham, a dedicated Yorkist, and secondly Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead. 
*Margaret Neville, who married firstly Sir John Mortimer (died before 12 November 1504), only son of Sir Hugh Mortimer and Eleanor Cornwall; secondly Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk (marriage annulled 1507), and thirdly Robert Downes, Gentleman. 
*Lucy Neville (died 1534), who married firstly Sir Thomas FitzWilliam of Aldwark, North Yorkshire, and secondly Sir Anthony Browne. After 1485, her loyalty to the Tudors was always deeply suspect, and she was noted in official reports as &quot;one who loves not the King (Henry VII)&quot;. 
*Isabel Neville, who married firstly Sir William Huddleston of Millom, Cumberland (an important regional family and old allies of the Nevilles), and secondly Sir William Smythe of Elford in Staffordshire.

===Arms===
Montagu took for his crest &quot;a griffin issuing from a ducal crown&quot;. His coat of arms was the Neville &quot;Gules a saltire argent&quot; with a label &quot;gobony argent and azure crescent&quot; for differencing, as a younger son, being a reference to the arms of Beaufort (Neville arms with label compony of Beaufort, borne as a difference to the paternal Neville arms (&quot;Gules, a saltire argent&quot;) by the descendants of the second marriage of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland (d.1425) to Joan Beaufort, a legitimised daughter of John of Gaunt, 4th son of King Edward III). This coat, when he was made Marquis of Montagu, was later augmented with further quarterings.

<text>Arachnology is the scientific study of arachnids, which comprise spiders and related invertebrates such as scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and harvestmen. Those who study spiders and other arachnids are arachnologists. More narrowly, the study of spiders alone (order Araneae) is known as araneology.

The word &quot;&quot; derives from the Greek words , &quot;arachnē&quot;, &quot;spider&quot;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;the study of a particular subject&quot;. The greek word for &quot;spider&quot; itself refers to Arachne, the female protagonist of an ancient tale of the Greek Mythology.

==Arachnology as a science==
Arachnologists are primarily responsible for classifying arachnids and studying aspects of their biology. In the popular imagination, they are sometimes referred to as spider experts. Disciplines within arachnology include naming species and determining their evolutionary relationships to one another (taxonomy and systematics), studying how they interact with other members of their species and/or their environment (behavioural ecology), or how they are distributed in different regions and habitats (faunistics). Other arachnologists perform research on the anatomy or physiology of arachnids, including the venom of spiders and scorpions. Others study the impact of spiders in agricultural ecosystems and whether they can be used as biological control agents.

===Subdisciplines===
Arachnology can be broken down into several specialties, including:
* acarology – the study of ticks and mites
* araneology – the study of spiders
* scorpiology – the study of scorpions

=== Arachnological societies ===
Arachnologists are served by a number of scientific societies, both national and international in scope. Their main roles are to encourage the exchange of ideas between researchers, to organise meetings and congresses, and in a number of cases, to publish academic journals. Some are also involved in science outreach programs, such as the &quot;European spider of the year&quot;, which raise awareness of these animals among the general public.

==Popular arachnology==
In the 1970s, arachnids – particularly tarantulas – started to become popular as exotic pets. Many tarantulas consequently became more widely known by their common names, such as Mexican redknee tarantula for &quot;Brachypelma hamorii&quot;.

Various societies now focus on the husbandry, care, study, and captive breeding of tarantulas, and other arachnids. They also typically produce journals or newsletters with articles and advice on these subjects.

<doc id="248135" wikidata="Q407627" url="?curid=248135" title="Azide">
<text>In chemistry, azide (, ) is a linear, polyatomic anion with the formula and structure . It is the conjugate base of hydrazoic acid . Organic azides are organic compounds with the formula , containing the azide functional group. The dominant application of azides is as a propellant in air bags.

== Preparation ==
Sodium azide is made industrially by the reaction of nitrous oxide, with sodium amide in liquid ammonia as solvent:

Many inorganic azides can be prepared directly or indirectly from sodium azide. For example, lead azide, used in detonators, may be prepared from the metathesis reaction between lead nitrate and sodium azide. An alternative route is direct reaction of the metal with silver azide dissolved in liquid ammonia. Some azides are produced by treating the carbonate salts with hydrazoic acid.

== Bonding ==
Azide is isoelectronic with carbon dioxide , cyanate , nitrous oxide , nitronium ion , molecular beryllium fluoride and cyanogen fluoride FCN. Per valence bond theory, azide can be described by several resonance structures; an important one being .

== Reactions ==
Azide salts can decompose with release of nitrogen gas. The decomposition temperatures of the alkali metal azides are:  (275 °C),  (355 °C),  (395 °C), and  (390 °C). This method is used to produce ultrapure alkali metals:

Protonation of azide salts gives toxic hydrazoic acid in the presence of strong acids:

Azide as a ligand forms numerous transition metal azide complexes. Some such compounds are shock sensitive.

Many inorganic covalent azides (e.g., fluorine azide, chlorine azide, bromine azide, iodine azide, silicon tetraazide) have been described.

The azide anion behaves as a nucleophile; it undergoes nucleophilic substitution for both aliphatic and aromatic systems. It reacts with epoxides, causing a ring-opening; it undergoes Michael-like conjugate addition to 1,4-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

Azides can be used as precursors of the metal nitrido complexes by being induced to release , generating a metal complex in unusual oxidation states (see &quot;high-valent iron&quot;).

=== Redox behaviour and trend to disproportionation ===
Azides have an ambivalent redox behavior: they are both oxidizing and reducing, as they are easily subject to disproportionation, as illustrated by the Frost diagram of nitrogen. This diagram shows the significant energetic instability of the hydrazoic acid (or the azide ion) surrounded by two much more stable species, the ammonium ion on the left and the molecular nitrogen on the right. As seen on the Frost diagram the disproportionation reaction lowers ∆G, the Gibbs free energy of the system , where F is the Faraday constant, z the number of electrons exchanged in the redox reaction, and E the standard electrode potential). By minimizing the energy in the system, the disproportionation reaction increases its thermodynamical stability.

=== Destruction by oxidation by nitrite ===
Azides decompose with nitrite compounds such as sodium nitrite. Each elementary redox reaction is also a comproportionation reaction because two different N-species () converge to a same one (respectively ) and is favored when the solution is acidified. This is a method of destroying residual azides, prior to disposal. In the process, nitrogen gas () and nitrogen oxides ( and NO) are formed:



Azide (-⅓) (the reductant, electron donor) is oxidized in (0), nitrous oxide () (+1), or nitric oxide (NO) (+2) while nitrite (+3) (the oxidant, electron acceptor) is simultaneously reduced to the same corresponding species in each elementary redox reaction considered here above. The respective stability of the reaction products of these three comproportionation redox reactions is in the following order: , as can be verified in the Frost diagram for nitrogen.

== Applications ==
In 2005, about 251 tons of azide-containing compounds were annually produced in the world, the main product being sodium azide.

=== Primary explosives and propellants===
Sodium azide is the propellant in automobile airbags. It decomposes on heating to give nitrogen gas, which is used to quickly expand the air bag:

Heavy metal azides, such as lead azide, , are shock-sensitive detonators which violently decompose to the corresponding metal and nitrogen, for example:

Silver azide and barium azide are used similarly.

Some organic azides are potential rocket propellants, an example being 2-dimethylaminoethylazide (DMAZ) .

=== Microbial inhibitor and undesirable side effects ===
Sodium azide is commonly used in the laboratory as a bacteriostatic agent to avoid microbial proliferation in abiotic control experiments in which it is important to avoid microbial activity. However, it has the disadvantage to be prone to trigger unexpected and undesirable side reactions that can jeopardize the experimental results. Indeed, the azide anion is a nucleophile and a redox-active species. Being prone to disproportionation, it can behave both as an oxidizing and as a reducing agent. Therefore, it is susceptible to interfere in an unpredictable way with many substances. For example, the azide anion can oxidize pyrite () with the formation of thiosulfate (), or reduce quinone into hydroquinone. It can also reduce nitrite into nitrous oxide , and into (zerovalent iron, ZVI). Azide can also enhance the emission in soil. A proposed explanation is the stimulation of the denitrification processes because of the azide’s role in the synthesis of denitrifying enzymes. Moreover, azide also affects the absorbance and fluorescence optical properties of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils. Many other interferences are reported in the literature for biochemical and biological analyses and they should be systematically identified and first rigorously tested in the laboratory before to use azide as microbial inhibitor for a given application. 

=== Purification of molten sodium ===
Sodium azide is used to purify metallic sodium in laboratories handling molten sodium used as a coolant for fast-neutron reactors.

As hydrazoic acid, the protonated form of the azide anion, has a very low reduction potential &quot;E&quot;°red = -3,09 volt, and is even a stronger reductant than lithium (&quot;E&quot;°red = -3.04 volt), dry solid sodium azide can be added to molten metallic sodium (&quot;E&quot;°red = -2,71 volt) under strict anoxic conditions (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in a special anaerobic glovebox with very low residual to reduce impurities still present into the sodium bath. The reaction residue is only gaseous .

As &quot;E&quot;°ox = -&quot;E&quot;°red, it gives the following series of oxidation reactions when the redox couples are presented as reductants: 
* (&quot;E&quot;°ox = +3,09 volt)
* (&quot;E&quot;°ox = +3,04 volt)
* (&quot;E&quot;°ox = +2,71 volt)

=== Click chemistry ===

The azide functional group is commonly utilized in click chemistry through copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, where copper(I) catalyzes the cycloaddition of an organoazide to a terminal alkyne, forming a triazole.

=== Other uses ===
A very damaging and illegal usage of sodium azide is its diversion by poachers as a substitute of sodium cyanide to poison some animal species by blocking the electron transport chain in the cellular respiration process.

== Safety ==
Azides are explosophores and respiratory poisons. Sodium azide () is as toxic as sodium cyanide (NaCN) (with an oral of 27 mg/kg in rats) and can be absorbed through the skin. When sodium azide enters in contact with an acid, it produces volatile hydrazoic acid (), as toxic and volatile as hydrogen cyanide (HCN). When accidentally present in the air of a laboratory at low concentration, it can cause irritations such as nasal stuffiness, or suffocation and death at elevated concentrations.

Heavy metal azides, such as lead azide () are primary high explosives detonable when heated or shaken. Heavy-metal azides are formed when solutions of sodium azide or vapors come into contact with heavy metals (Pb, Hg…) or their salts. Heavy-metal azides can accumulate under certain circumstances, for example, in metal pipelines and on the metal components of diverse equipment (rotary evaporators, freezedrying equipment, cooling traps, water baths, waste pipes), and thus lead to violent explosions.

<text>Gloria Richetta Jones (born October 19, 1945) is an American singer and songwriter who first found success in the United Kingdom, being recognized there as &quot;The Queen of Northern Soul&quot;. She recorded the 1965 hit song &quot;Tainted Love&quot; and has worked in multiple genres as a Motown songwriter and recording artist, backing vocalist, and as a performer in musicals such as &quot;Hair&quot;. In the 1970s, she was a keyboardist and vocalist in Marc Bolan&#x27;s glam rock band T. Rex. She and Bolan were also in a committed romantic relationship and had a son together.

==Early life and career==
Jones was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and moved to Los Angeles, California, at the age of seven, where she first started singing. Jones&#x27; first taste of fame came at the age of 14, when, while still at school, she formed with Frankie Kahrl and Billy Preston the successful gospel group the COGIC Singers, with whom she recorded the album &quot;It&#x27;s a Blessing&quot;. Although she remained with the group for some four years, she soon found herself drawn into the Los Angeles pop scene.

In 1964, Jones, in her late teens, was discovered by the songwriter Ed Cobb. Signing with Cobb&#x27;s Greengrass Productions, she recorded her first hit record, &quot;Heartbeat Pts 1 &amp; 2,&quot; which Cobb wrote and produced.

She toured the United States, performing on several American television programs, footage of which still exists. One performance occurred at a Rock and Soul show in Disneyland in the summer of 1965. &quot;Heartbeat&quot; became a rhythm and blues tune which was recorded later by Dusty Springfield, Spencer Davis and many other artists.

By then, Jones had recorded other songs for Uptown Records, a subsidiary of Capitol/EMI. Included among these was another Cobb-written song, &quot;Tainted Love&quot;. So strong was Jones&#x27;s following in Northern England that she was proclaimed &quot;The Queen of Northern Soul&quot;. 

Jones also recorded an album for the Uptown label entitled &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; which was released in 1966. Jones studied piano, and acquired an advanced classical degree primarily in the works of Bach. 

In 1968, she joined the cast of &quot;Catch My Soul&quot;, a rock and soul version of the play &quot;Othello&quot;, which included cast members Jerry Lee Lewis, The Blossoms, and Dr. John. During the summer of 1968, she performed in a play called &quot;Revolution&quot;, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. That winter, she joined the Los Angeles cast of &quot;Hair&quot;, the musical. Eventually, she was to meet Pam Sawyer, who asked her to write for Motown Records. Jones and Sawyer were amongst the second string of writers at Motown, but still wrote for such artists as Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Commodores, The Four Tops and The Jackson 5. 

As Jones was also initially a singer for the label, protocol demanded a pseudonym, so for some of her co-writes she used the name LaVerne Ware.

Songs that Jones worked on during this period include The Supremes&#x27; &quot;Have I Lost You&quot; (writer), Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross&#x27;s &quot;My Mistake (Was to Love You)&quot; (writer), Junior Walker&#x27;s &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot; (writer/producer) and the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;Just Seven Numbers (Can Straighten Out My Life)&quot; (writer). In 1970 she provided backing vocals on Ry Cooder&#x27;s eponymous first album. The best-known song that Jones penned was Gladys Knight and the Pips&#x27; &quot;If I Were Your Woman&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy in 1971. Jones left Motown at the end of 1973, following the release of her album &quot;Share My Love&quot;.

== After Motown ==

Jones first met Marc Bolan of T. Rex in 1969 while performing in &quot;Hair&quot; (Los Angeles cast). While touring in Europe, Bolan and Jones met for the second time at the Speakeasy in London. In 1972, she was recommended by Warner Brothers&#x27; Bob Regehr to sing backing vocals behind T. Rex at Winterland in San Francisco.

Soon after joining T. Rex, Jones and Bolan became romantically involved. They had a son, Rolan Bolan (b. September 26, 1975). She sang backing vocals and played clavinet with T. Rex from 1973 to 1977. Her rendition of &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; appears as a bonus track on T. Rex&#x27;s album &quot;Bolan&#x27;s Zip Gun&quot;. Jones released an album in 1976, called &quot;Vixen&quot;, which featured several songs written by Bolan, and he also was the producer for the album.

In 1977, Jones worked with the group Gonzalez, producing several of their singles, and also penning the disco hit, &quot;Haven&#x27;t Stopped Dancing Yet&quot; for the group. She toured the UK with Gonzalez, first on the Bob Marley tour, and then with Osibisa.

== Automobile accident ==
She was the driver of the car, a Mini 1275 GT, that struck a tree near Barnes Common, killing Bolan at 4 a.m. on September 16, 1977, on the way back to Bolan&#x27;s Richmond property. They had been returning from an evening at a restaurant in Mayfair where they had both been drinking wine. Jones was found by her brother Richard with her foot trapped beneath the clutch by the engine. Bolan was found unconscious in the passenger seat, which had been dislodged and landed in the rear of the vehicle. Jones was wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. Bolan was not wearing a seat belt. Jones was conscious after the crash. Bolan, who was a passenger in the car that slammed into the tree, was pronounced dead at the scene on the arrival of paramedics. Jones survived the crash but was critically injured. She sustained a broken jaw in the crash and was sent directly to the hospital in London for treatment, fighting for her life while in critical condition. When she recovered sufficiently to leave hospital, she was informed that Bolan&#x27;s fans had looted most of their possessions from their house. She was later scheduled to appear in court in London on charges of being unfit to drive and of driving a car in a dangerous condition. However, she left the UK with her son and returned to the US before the court date, so the Coroner&#x27;s Court recorded a verdict of accidental death.

==After Bolan==
Having lost her possessions, Jones moved with her son back to Los Angeles, where they stayed with Jones&#x27;s family.

In 1978, she released the album &quot;Windstorm&quot;, which she dedicated to the memory of Bolan: the back cover reads, &quot;Special dedication in memory of my son&#x27;s father, Marc Bolan, whom we miss very much.&quot; Her single &quot;Bring on the Love&quot; was a success on the American R&amp;B chart.

Jones stayed in the music industry for several years after, releasing an album produced by Ed Cobb, titled &quot;Reunited&quot; in 1981. She also collaborated again with Billy Preston and other Cogic Singers for a 1984 reunion album &quot;The Cogic&#x27;s&quot;. She has since worked as a musical supervisor for films.

On her 1982 album &quot;Reunited&quot;, she was proclaimed &quot;Northern Queen of Soul&quot;.

In 2010, together with her son Rolan, she established the Marc Bolan School of Music &amp; Film in Makeni, Sierra Leone.

<text>Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, KG (134323 July 1403) was an English medieval nobleman and naval commander best known for leading the rebellion with his nephew Henry Percy, known as &#x27;Harry Hotspur&#x27;, and his elder brother, Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland.

==Lineage==
He was the younger son of Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy, and Mary, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, who in turn was a grandson of Henry III of England. He was the younger brother of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. Percy never married nor had children.

==Career==
Worcester fought against England&#x27;s traditional enemy France in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and then served in various important governing posts in English-controlled France, as Ambassador, Seneschal. He was appointed Admiral of the North from 26 January 1384 to 22 February 1385. In the 1390s he built Wressle Castle. He was created Earl of Worcester in 1397 by King Richard II. In 1399 he was appointed Admiral of the Kings Fleet in Ireland.

==Close to the crown==
Along with his brother and nephew, he took part in Henry IV&#x27;s deposition of Richard II. He is said to have broken the staff of office symbolizing his position as Richard II&#x27;s steward when declaring for the revolt. Later, in turn, he took part in the Percies&#x27; own subsequent rebellion against King Henry IV. He is said to have negotiated with Henry IV before the Battle of Shrewsbury and then misrepresented King Henry&#x27;s offer for a settlement to persuade his nephew Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; to reject the offer and fight the battle.

==Capture and execution==
He was captured at the Battle of Shrewsbury and publicly beheaded in Shrewsbury two days later, on 23 July 1403. He was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. His head was displayed in London on London Bridge.

==Fictional portrayals==
He appears in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; as the main plotter of the 1403 rebellion.

<text>The only official flag for Northern Ireland is the Union Flag or Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom; there is no official local flag that represents only Northern Ireland. The flying of various flags in Northern Ireland is a significant sectarian issue, with different communities identifying with different flags.

The Ulster Banner was used by the Northern Irish government from 1953 until the government and parliament were abolished in 1973. Since then, it has had no official status. However, it is still used as the flag of Northern Ireland by both loyalists and unionists and to represent Northern Ireland internationally in some sporting competitions, like the Commonwealth Games.

The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Saltire represents Northern Ireland indirectly as Ireland in the Union Flag. It is sometimes flown during Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parades in Northern Ireland and is used to represent Northern Ireland during some royal events.

In recent years, there have been calls for a new, neutral flag for Northern Ireland, most recently as a recommendation by the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition in December 2021.

==Flag of the Government of Northern Ireland (1924–1973)==

The Ulster Banner, also known as the Red Hand Flag or the Ulster Flag (not to be confused with the provincial Flag of Ulster), was the flag that was granted a royal warrant for use to the Government of Northern Ireland in 1924. In common with other British flags, any civic status of the flag was not defined in law.

The Government of Northern Ireland was granted arms by royal warrant and had the right to display these arms on a flag or banner. This right was exercised for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 when the banner was flown for the first time over Parliament Buildings in honor of Elizabeth&#x27;s visit. Also during her visit, on 1 July 1953, the Minister for Home Affairs announced that, while the Union Flag was the only standard officially recognized, those who wished to have a distinctive Ulster symbol might use the banner. When the Parliament of Northern Ireland was dissolved by the British government under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, the flag ceased to be used by a body with a royal warrant but remains the only flag which represents Northern Ireland at international level in sport.

Since the Northern Ireland government and parliament were abolished in 1972, the use of the Ulster Banner among loyalists has increased.

==Official use of flags==
There are various practices for the flying of flags by public bodies in Northern Ireland. The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) Order 2000 requires that the Union Flag be flown over specified government buildings including Parliament Buildings and state offices on specified &quot;named days&quot; (for example, it was traditionally used to honour the late Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s official birthday).

The regulations also provide that, on the occasion of a visit to a government building by the British Monarch, the Royal Standard shall be flown, and the Union Flag can be flown, and on state visits from other heads of state the Union Flag and the national flag of the country of the visitor can be flown. The regulations prohibit any flags being flown from the relevant buildings except as expressly permitted by the regulations.

When flags representing the &quot;Home Countries&quot; of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are flown at official ceremonies, Northern Ireland is sometimes represented by the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cross, for instance on the barge &quot;Gloriana&quot; during the 2012 Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant. In May 2016 the Ulster Banner was flown from horseback during the Musical Ride of the Household Cavalry at the Queen&#x27;s 90th birthday celebration at Windsor, alongside the flags of England, Scotland and Wales.

Other regulations exist for other public bodies in Northern Ireland. Use of flags by the Police Service of Northern Ireland is governed by the Police Emblems and Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002, which provides that no flag shall be used by the service other than its own flag.

===Local authorities===
Legislation relating to flag flying does not apply to district council buildings, and district councils follow a range of practices varying from flying the Union Flag on a number of council buildings every day of the year as at Lisburn, to flying no flags on any building, flying only the council flag or flying flags on the designated days in the same way as government buildings.

In 2004, Belfast City Council commissioned a study on the flying of the Union Flag which noted that the Ulster Banner was flown alongside it by three unionist-controlled district councils at that time: Ards, Carrickfergus and Castlereagh. These councils have since been replaced.

==Displaying flags==

In Northern Ireland, some members from each of the unionist and nationalist communities use flags to declare their political allegiances and to mark territory. Unionists and loyalists fly the Union Flag and Ulster Banner to show their support for the union and/or their allegiance to Northern Ireland. Irish nationalists and republicans fly the Irish tricolour to show their support for a United Ireland.

After the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, flags continue to be a source of disagreement in Northern Ireland. The Agreement states that:

Nationalists pointed to this to argue that the use of the Union Flag for official purposes should be restricted, or that the Irish tricolour should be flown alongside the British flag on government buildings. Sinn Féin ministers in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive instructed that the Union Flag was not to fly from buildings operated by their respective departments. This power was removed from ministers by virtue of the Flag Regulations (Northern Ireland) Order 2000, mentioned above.

All signatories to the Good Friday Agreement also declare their acceptance of the &quot;principle of consent&quot; (i.e. that there will be no change to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland unless a majority votes for it), and Unionists argued that this provision amounts to recognising that the Union Flag is the only legitimate official flag in Northern Ireland. The problem was discussed in detail and various proposals made including suggestions for a new flag.

==Flag proposals==
===Haass talks===
In 2013, US diplomat Richard N. Haass chaired talks between the political parties in Northern Ireland dealing with, among other things, the issue of flags. The resulting draft proposals, which were not agreed to by the parties, included the idea of a new flag for Northern Ireland, and the possibility of a &quot;circumscribed role for the sovereign flag of Ireland in conjunction with the Union flag.&quot;

===Proposed &quot;Civic Flag&quot;===
In December 2021, the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition published its final report which included a recommendation that a new &quot;Civic Flag for Northern Ireland&quot; should be adopted and be flown at buildings of the Northern Ireland Executive, Northern Ireland Assembly and local district councils in Northern Ireland. The commissions suggested that the design for the new flag should incorporate expressions of Britishness and Irishness and should also represent the diversity of the community in Northern Ireland. The working group on flags, identity, culture and tradition last met in January 2022, prior to the collapse of the power sharing executive the following month. In November 2024, the Executive Office said that the Commission&#x27;s report will be &quot;considered as part of a review of its community relations strategy&quot;.

==International sport==
The Ulster Banner is used to represent the Northern Ireland team at the Commonwealth Games, to represent golfers on the PGA Tour, and by FIFA to represent the Northern Ireland national football team.

In November 2024, the Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council (NICGC) discussed the possibility of using its own flag at the Commonwealth Games if a new &quot;Civic Flag&quot; proposed by the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Traditions is not in place before the 2026 Commonwealth Games. The NICGC was subsequently forced to close its offices for security reasons after receiving threats from Loyalist paramilitary groups.

<text>Cameo-Kid was a United States–based record label in the 1920s. 

Cameo-Kid was a subsidiary of Cameo Records, marketing recordings intended for children. Cameo-Kid used professional artists with known names in their recordings, including star Vaudeville singers and noted dance-band musicians. This was unlike some other early Children&#x27;s records labels, which tended to feature recordings by unnamed and undistinguished talent. Cameo-Kid artists probably recorded these discs while in the Cameo studios for recording more mainstream records.

Cameo-Kid Records are double-sided 7-inch gramophone records.

<text>Credo Reference or Credo (formerly Xrefer) is an American company that offers online reference content by subscription and partners with libraries to develop information-literacy programs or produce library marketing plans and materials. Founded in 1999, Credo Reference provides full-text online versions of over 3,500 published reference works from more than 100 publishers in a variety of major subjects. These include general and subject dictionaries as well as encyclopedias. The company&#x27;s customers are libraries, library systems, k-12 schools, and universities, which subscribe to the service for their patrons&#x27; use.

In 2010, a review of general reference sources by Library Journal focused on Credo Reference and three similar services. The review noted Credo Reference&#x27;s internal linking within the site from one reference work to another.

== History ==
The company was founded as Xrefer in 1999. Xrefer initially provided free access to several dozen reference works. In 2002, Béla Hatvany, founder of Computer Library Services (CLSI) and Silverplatter, invested in Xrefer and funded the company&#x27;s transition to becoming an online reference database product for libraries. The company established an office in Boston, MA USA, which would later become its headquarters. The name Credo Reference was adopted in June 2007; the company also moved its England office from London to Oxford in that year.

In 2018, Credo Reference was acquired by Infobase Publishing.

These companies dispute the allegation that they are a duopoly; LexisNexis sued &quot;TheLaw.net&quot; which used the terms &quot;Wexis&quot; and &quot;duopoly&quot; in its marketing literature.

==Antitrust issues==
The United States district court imposed various requirements regarding the companies&#x27; operations in a consent decree resulting from an antitrust inquiry by the United States Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in connection with Thomson&#x27;s purchase of West Publishing, and West&#x27;s and Lexis&#x27;s settlement of various outstanding claims in that proceeding. For example, West was required to license the &quot;star pagination&quot; in its printed reporters under certain terms. Otherwise, lawyers in jurisdictions that require citations to all official and unofficial reporters would have to subscribe to &quot;both&quot; online services to get all the necessary page numbers for citations in their briefs. The judge also had concerns about the Thomson and West products ordered to be divested through a sale to Lexis, primarily statutory and case law publications of Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, such as &quot;United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers&#x27; Edition&quot; and &quot;United States Code Service&quot;, but those sales were ultimately approved.

Both companies are known for their aggressive marketing programs in American law schools. Law students may print documents for free that are obtained through their respective services. Both companies ran programs through which students earned points (based on their number of searches) that could be redeemed for free gifts. While LexisNexis still runs its rewards program, Westlaw has discontinued its promotion.

Wolters Kluwer is the largest company which to date has attempted to establish a beachhead against the &quot;Wexis&quot; duopoly. At one point, it took over offline legal publishers like Aspen Publishing and online legal services like Loislaw, and also owns Commerce Clearing House (CCH). However, Wolters never developed an automated cross-referencing or citation-checking service that could directly compete against Westlaw&#x27;s KeyCite or Shepard&#x27;s Citations from LexisNexis. Wolters eventually sold Loislaw in 2015 and Aspen in 2021, but still owns CCH. 

Bloomberg Industry Group is the best known of the remaining law publishing companies. Both Bloomberg and CCH have arrangements with Lexis and Westlaw to publish their content though those electronic services, although they also provide their subscribers web access to certain publications.

<text>An inert gas is a gas that does not readily undergo chemical reactions with other chemical substances and therefore does not readily form chemical compounds. Though inert gases have a variety of applications, they are generally used to prevent unwanted chemical reactions with the oxygen (oxidation) and moisture (hydrolysis) in the air from degrading a sample. Generally, all noble gases except oganesson (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon), nitrogen, and carbon dioxide are considered inert gases. The term &quot;inert gas&quot; is context-dependent because several of the inert gases, including nitrogen and carbon dioxide, can be made to react under certain conditions.

Purified argon gas is the most commonly used inert gas due to its high natural abundance (78.3% N2, 1% Ar in air) and low relative cost.

Unlike noble gases, an inert gas is not necessarily elemental and is often a compound gas. Like the noble gases, the tendency for non-reactivity is due to the valence, the outermost electron shell, being complete in all the inert gases. This is a tendency, not a rule, as all noble gases and other &quot;inert&quot; gases can react to form compounds under &quot;some&quot; conditions.

==Need and necessity==
The inert gases are obtained by fractional distillation of air, with the exception of helium which is separated from a few natural gas sources rich in this element, through cryogenic distillation or membrane separation. For specialized applications, purified inert gas shall be produced by specialized generators on-site. They are often used by chemical tankers and product carriers (smaller vessels). Benchtop specialized generators are also available for laboratories.

==Applications of inert gas==
Because of the non-reactive properties of inert gases, they are often useful to prevent undesirable chemical reactions from taking place. Food is packed in an inert gas to remove oxygen gas. This prevents bacteria from growing. It also prevents chemical oxidation by oxygen in normal air. An example is the rancidification (caused by oxidation) of edible oils. In food packaging, inert gases are used as a passive preservative, in contrast to active preservatives like sodium benzoate (an antimicrobial) or BHT (an antioxidant).

Historical documents may also be stored under inert gas to avoid degradation. For example, the original documents of the U.S. Constitution are stored under humidified argon. Helium was previously used, but it was less suitable because it diffuses out of the case more quickly than argon.

Inert gases are often used in the chemical industry. In a chemical manufacturing plant, reactions can be conducted under inert gas to minimize fire hazards or unwanted reactions. In such plants and in oil refineries, transfer lines and vessels can be purged with inert gas as a fire and explosion prevention measure. At the bench scale, chemists perform experiments on air-sensitive compounds using air-free techniques developed to handle them under inert gas. Helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon are inert gases.

===Inert gas systems on ships===
Inert gas is produced on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes from Jan 1, 2016) by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator. The inert gas system is used to prevent the atmosphere in cargo tanks or bunkers from coming into the explosive range. Inert gases keep the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. Inert gases are most important during discharging and during the ballast voyage when more hydrocarbon vapor is likely to be present in the tank atmosphere. Inert gas can also be used to purge the tank of the volatile atmosphere in preparation for gas freeing - replacing the atmosphere with breathable air - or vice versa.
The flue gas system uses the boiler exhaust as its source, so it is important that the fuel/air ratio in the boiler burners is properly regulated to ensure that high-quality inert gases are produced. Too much air would result in an oxygen content exceeding 5%, and too much fuel oil would result in the carryover of dangerous hydrocarbon gas.
The flue gas is cleaned and cooled by the scrubber tower. Various safety devices prevent overpressure, the return of hydrocarbon gas to the engine room, or having a supply of IG with too high oxygen content.

Gas tankers and product carriers cannot rely on flue gas systems (because they require IG with O2 content of 1% or less) and so use inert gas generators instead. The inert gas generator consists of a combustion chamber and scrubber unit supplied by fans and a refrigeration unit which cools the gas. A drier in series with the system removes moisture from the gas before it is supplied to the deck. Cargo tanks on gas carriers are not inerted, but the whole space around them is.

===Inert gas systems on aircraft===
Inert gas is produced on board commercial and military aircraft in order to passivate fuel tanks. On hot days, fuel vapour in fuel tanks may otherwise form a flammable or explosive mixture which if oxidized, could have catastrophic consequences. Conventionally, Air Separation Modules (ASMs) have been used to generate inert gas. ASMs contain selectively permeable membranes. They are fed compressed air that is extracted from a compressor stage of a gas turbine engine. The pressure drives the separation of oxygen from the air due to the increased permeability of oxygen through the ASMs in comparison to nitrogen. For fuel tank passivation, it is not necessary to remove all oxygen, but rather enough to stay below the lean flammability limit and the lean explosion limit. In contrast to the oxygen concentration of 21% in air, 10% to 12% in the ullage of a passivated fuel tank is common over the course of a flight.

===Welding===
In gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), inert gases are used to shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in the solidified weld puddle. Inert gases are also used in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) for welding non-ferrous metals. Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often be used as a substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, carbon dioxide is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to the weld pool created by arc welding. But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer is used in GMAW. The most common is spray arc transfer, and the most commonly used gas mixture for spray arc transfer is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide.

===Diving===
In underwater diving an inert gas is a component of the breathing mixture which is not metabolically active and serves to dilute the gas mixture. The inert gas may have effects on the diver, but these are thought to be mostly physical effects, such as tissue damage caused by bubbles in decompression sickness. The most common inert gas used in breathing gas for commercial diving is helium.

<text>Gaius Petronius Arbiter (; ; ; sometimes Titus Petronius Niger) was a Roman courtier during the reign of Nero. He is generally believed to be the author of the &quot;Satyricon&quot;, a satirical novel believed to have been written during the Neronian era (54–68 AD). He is one of the most important characters in Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27; historical novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1895). Leo Genn portrays him in the 1951 film of the same name.

== Life ==
A reference to Petronius by Sidonius Apollinaris places him, or his &quot;Satyricon&quot;, in Massalia (ancient Marseille). He might have been born and educated there. Tacitus, Plutarch and Pliny the Elder describe Petronius as the &quot;elegantiae arbiter&quot; (also phrased &quot;arbiter elegantiarum&quot;), &quot;judge of elegance&quot;, in the court of the emperor Nero. He served as suffect consul in 62. Later, he became a member of the senatorial class who devoted himself to a life of pleasure. His relationship to Nero was apparently akin to that of a fashion advisor.

Tacitus gives this account of Petronius in his historical work the &quot;Annals&quot; (XVI.18):
None of the ancient sources give any further detail about his life, or mention that he was a writer. However, a medieval manuscript written around 1450 of the &quot;Satyricon&quot; credited a &quot;Titus Petronius&quot; as the author of the original work. Traditionally, this reference is linked with Petronius Arbiter, since the novel appears to have been written or at least set during his lifetime. The link, however, remains speculative and disputed.

=== As a writer ===
Petronius&#x27; development of his characters in the &quot;Satyricon&quot;, namely Trimalchio, transcends the traditional style of writing of ancient literature. In the literature written during Petronius&#x27; lifetime, the emphasis was always on the typical considerations of plot, which had been laid down by classical rules. The character, which was hardly known in ancient literature, was secondary. Petronius goes beyond these literary limitations in his exact portrayals of detailed speech, behaviour, surroundings, and appearance of the characters.

Another literary device Petronius employs in his novel is a collection of specific allusions. The allusions to certain people and events are evidence that the &quot;Satyricon&quot; was written during Nero&#x27;s time. These also suggest that it was aimed at a contemporary audience which consisted in part of Nero&#x27;s courtiers and even Nero himself.

One such allusion, found in chapter 9, refers to the story of the good wife Lucretia which was well known at the time:

The message Petronius tries to convey in his work is far from moral and does not intend to produce reform, but is written above all to entertain and should be considered artistically. Nevertheless, his writings can be a valuable tool to better comprehend the customs and ways of life of Roman society at that particular time, since the author strives to preserve the plausibility of his representation, as can be noted by the frequent use of allusions and detailed descriptions of characters and behaviours. As the title implies, the &quot;Satyricon&quot; is a satire, specifically a Menippean satire, in which Petronius satirizes nearly anything, using his taste as the only standard. It is speculated that Petronius&#x27; depiction of Trimalchio mirrors that of Nero. Although the author&#x27;s own opinion is never alluded to, the opinions of the characters involved in the story are evident, as is how Encolpius criticizes Trimalchio.

In modern times, a popular quote about reorganization is often, but falsely, attributed to a Roman named Petronius; it may in fact be by Charlton Ogburn, 1957.

=== Death ===
Petronius&#x27; high position soon made him the object of envy for those around him. Having attracted the jealousy of Tigellinus, the commander of the emperor&#x27;s guard, he was accused of treason. He was arrested at Cumae in 65 AD but did not wait for a sentence. Instead, he chose to take his own life. Tacitus again records his elegant suicide in the sixteenth book of the &quot;Annals&quot;:

According to Pliny the Elder: . T. Petronius and G. Petronius have been said to have been the same man.

<doc id="248175" wikidata="Q7097619" url="?curid=248175" title="British involvement in the Iraq War">
<text>Operation Telic (Op TELIC) was the codename under which all of the United Kingdom&#x27;s military operations in Iraq were conducted between the start of the invasion of Iraq on 19 March 2003 and the withdrawal of the last remaining British forces on 22 May 2011. The bulk of the mission ended on 30 April 2009 but around 150 troops, mainly from the Royal Navy, remained in Iraq until 22 May 2011 as part of the Iraqi Training and Advisory Mission. 46,000 troops were deployed at the onset of the invasion and the total cost of war stood at £9.24 billion in 2010.

==Background==
Operation Telic was the largest deployment of British forces since World War II. It was only approached in size by the 1991 Operation Granby deployment for the Gulf War and the 1956 Operation Musketeer Suez Crisis deployment. It was considerably larger than the 1982 Operation Corporate in the Falklands War, which saw around 30,000 personnel deployed and the Korean War, which saw fewer than 20,000 personnel deployed.

Some 9,500 of the British servicemen and women who deployed on Operation Telic for the invasion and its aftermath were reservists, from the Territorial Army, Royal Naval Reserve and from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment.

Notice that additional British forces were deploying to the region (large numbers of RAF personnel were already deployed in Kuwait, Turkey and elsewhere in the region on Operations Northern Watch and Southern Watch) was given in three separate Commons statements by Geoff Hoon Secretary of State for Defence. On 7 January, the deployment of Royal Navy and Royal Marines was announced. 20 January saw the land forces deployment announced and 6 February the Royal Air Force. They were ready in time for hostilities to start on 19 March. When compared with the deployment of forces prior to the Gulf War things proceeded a great deal faster, with the slowest deploying elements taking 10 weeks to get from base to combat readiness in the theatre.

The deployment used 64 British and foreign flagged merchant vessels.

 means a purposeful or defined action (from Greek τέλος, &quot;telos&quot;). Unlike the United States who called their equivalent military deployment Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Ministry of Defence uses a computer to generate its names so that they carry no overtly political connotations. The meaning was initially unknown but as initial planning took place over the Christmas 2002 period, the term became jokingly known amongst personnel as a backronym for Tell Everyone Leave Is Cancelled.

==Command structure==
The force was commanded by a three-star tri-service headquarters. The commander of the operation was Air Marshal Brian Burridge, with Major General Peter Wall acting as his chief of staff. The headquarters was situated at CENTCOM headquarters in Qatar. The three services each had two-star commanders leading operations. Major General Wall took over command of 1st Armoured Division on 1 May 2003. He was replaced as Chief of Staff by Major General Barney White-Spunner.

The Royal Navy commander was Rear Admiral David Snelson who had his headquarters ashore in Bahrain. The afloat Royal Navy commander was Commodore Jamie Miller, who had the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; as his flagship. Rear Admiral Snelson was succeeded by Major General Tony Milton, Commandant General Royal Marines as maritime forces commander on 16 April 2003. 

The 1st (United Kingdom) Armoured Division was commanded by Major General Robin Brims. Three army brigades were assigned to the division. 16 Air Assault Brigade was commanded by Brigadier &#x27;Jacko&#x27; Page, 7th Armoured Brigade by Brigadier Graham Binns and 102nd Logistic Brigade by Brigadier Shaun Cowlam. 3 Commando Brigade was under the operational command of the division and was commanded by Brigadier Jim Dutton. 

The Royal Air Force commander was Air Vice-Marshal Glenn Torpy.

==Post-invasion==

On 11 July 2003, 1st Armoured Division handed control over south-east Iraq to 3rd Mechanised Division, Major General Wall was succeeded by Major General Graeme Lamb as commander of British ground forces in Iraq. Unlike the invasion period, by then there was a substantial presence from many nations other than America, Britain, Australia and Poland. In addition to British troops, 3rd Division now commanded Italian, Dutch, Danish, Czech, Lithuanian, Norwegian, and New Zealand forces. 3rd Division handed over a new composite divisional headquarters on 28 December 2003. Major General Andrew Stewart took over from General Lamb as commander of British forces.

After the end of major operations, the main components of the British forces changed greatly. 3 Commando Brigade was withdrawn in early May and 16 Air Assault Brigade left later in the same month apart from a couple of infantry battalions. 7 Armoured Brigade remained until relieved by 19 Mechanised Brigade at the same time as 3rd Division took over from 1st Division. 102 Logistics Brigade was relieved by 101 Logistic Brigade in late May. Most of the RAF aircraft left the area with a few retained for patrols over Iraq and support of ground forces. British naval forces also returned to more usual levels, with two surface combatants, a tanker and a repair ship present in early July.

A further rotation of ground troops occurred in November 2003, with 19 Mechanised Brigade relieved by 20th Armoured Brigade; 20th Armoured Brigade in its turn being relieved by 1 Mechanised Brigade. In April 2004, 20th Armoured Brigade turned over its responsibilities to 1 Mechanised Brigade and Lieutenant General John McColl was appointed deputy commander of occupation ground forces. By July 2004 the British area saw its fifth commander when Major General Bill Rollo took over. At the end of 2004 General Rollo was succeeded by Major General Jonathan Riley and in November of that year 4 Armoured Brigade rotated to replace 1 Mechanised Brigade.

In May 2005, 4 Armoured Brigade was replaced by 12 Mechanised Brigade with the handover of responsibility taking place on 30 May.

In May 2006 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats were relieved by 20th Armoured Brigade under the command of Brigadier James Everard.

October 2006 saw 19 Light Brigade take over from 20th Armoured Brigade.

1 Mechanised Brigade provided HQ and troops for Op TELIC 10, deploying to Iraq in June 2007. During that tour, both the PJCC and Basra Palace were handed back to Iraqi control. They handed over to 4th Mechanised Brigade on 1 December 2007.

==Equipment==
The conflict saw over 100 fixed-wing aircraft and over 100 rotary-wing aircraft of virtually every type in the British inventory deployed. It also saw a 33 ship fleet, which was the largest taskforce deployed by the UK since the Falklands War. Some 120 Challenger 2 main battle tanks, 150 Warrior infantry fighting vehicles, 32 L131 self-propelled 155 mm howitzers, and 36 L118 105 mm towed howitzers were deployed with the land forces, with reconnaissance vehicles, and everything else that makes a modern mechanised and armoured force function.

During the post invasion phase, and following a number of British casualties blamed on inadequate equipment, a great deal of new equipment was purchased to help deal with the threats posed by insurgents. These included 166 armoured Pinzgauer Vector PPVs, 108 Mastiff PPVs, 145 enhanced FV430 Mk3 Bulldogs, Lockheed Martin Desert Hawk UAVs, and 8 Britten-Norman Defender ISTAR aircraft.

==Casualties==

A total of 179 British Armed Forces personnel died serving on Operation Telic between the start of the campaign in March 2003 and the end of operations in July 2009; 136 in hostile incidents and the remaining 43 under non-hostile circumstances. Full non-fatal casualty records are currently only available for the period after 1 January 2006. From that date, 3,598 British personnel were wounded, injured or fell ill (315 wounded in action); 1,971 of whom required aeromedical evacuation. By 11 March 2007, more than 2,100. 

In theatre both military and civilian casualties were treated by British Field Hospitals (FH), 22 FH in Kuwait and 34 FH in Iraq. 34 Field Hospital was made up of regular troops from their base in Strensall just outside York and members for volunteer reserve units from all over the country. A small 25 bedded hospital was sent across the Kuwait Iraq border in the early days of the war. On arrival at Shaibah the hospital was set up and ready to take casualties within six and a half hours. Everything that you would expect in a modern hospital was present with an Emergency Department, X-ray, Labs, Surgical Theatres x 2, ITU and a hospital ward.

In effect the hospital was based on the front line of the British area of responsibility and was the furthest forward medical unit in recent history. Casualties would often miss out the regimental aid posts and dressing stations and go straight to the hospital. Staff at the hospital worked 12 hour shifts without days off until more staff began to arrive around a month later. 

The hospital took over 3500 casualties of which more than 350 were major trauma cases, and around 70 paediatric trauma cases. Injuries included blunt trauma, gun shot wounds, shrapnel injuries and severe burns.

==In fiction==
The British television film &quot;The Mark of Cain&quot; depicted service of a fictional British Army unit, the 1st Battalion Northdale Rifles in Operation Telic, just after the end of combat operations and in the first stages of the occupation.

<doc id="248176" wikidata="Q256956" url="?curid=248176" title="Asphodelus ramosus">
<text>Asphodelus ramosus, the branched asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the order Asparagales. Similar in appearance to &quot;Asphodelus albus&quot; and particularly &quot;Asphodelus cerasiferus&quot; and &quot;Asphodelus aestivus&quot;, it may be distinguished by its highly branched stem and smaller fruits. There has been a lot of confusion over the nomenclature and taxonomy of the species, owing to its similarity to &quot;Asphodelus aestivus&quot;.

&quot;Asphodelus ramosus&quot; is native to the Mediterranean region of southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East. It can also be found in the Canary Islands. It is particularly common in coastal areas of the Mediterranean with intensive grazing and occasional fire. In some areas it shows an affinity for acidic soils, mainly schist. It can form abundant colonies, usually flowering in February to May. It has been thought to be Homer&#x27;s asphodel of the underworld, but so has the closely related &quot;Asphodeline lutea&quot;. The branched asphodel is known to contain colchicine, a chemical used in the treatment of gout.

==Physical characteristics==
&quot;Asphodelus ramosus&quot; is a geophyte, having an underground storage organ which enables the plant to survive adverse conditions, such as excessive heat and drought. Its leaves, growing to a height of –, contain alkaloids that are harmful to sheep and goats in the wet, winter months, but during the summer when their leaves dry out, they lose their toxicity. Its very numerous flowers are white with six tepals bearing a central brown streak. The fruits are small round capsules.

==Uses==
Some traditional folk usages of the plant have been to make a glue from the plant&#x27;s root. A remedy against warts is also derived from its root. According to Dioscorides, a concoction made from its roots (mixed with wine) induces vomiting. Formerly, the entire plant was used in treating venomous snake bites (its efficacy yet to be proven scientifically).

<text>Menippus of Gadara (; &quot;Menippos ho Gadareus&quot;; fl. 3rd century BC) was a Cynic satirist. The Menippean satire genre is named after him. His works, all of which are lost, were an important influence on Varro and Lucian, who ranks Menippus with Antisthenes, Diogenes, and Crates as among the most notable of the Cynics.

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Menippus. He was of Phoenician descent, from the Greek city of Gadara in Coele-Syria. He was originally a slave, in the service of a citizen of Pontus, but in some way obtained his freedom and relocated to Thebes. Diogenes Laërtius relates a dubious story that he amassed a fortune as a money-lender, lost it, and committed suicide.

==Writings==
His works (written in a mixture of prose and verse) are all lost. He discussed serious subjects in a spirit of ridicule, and especially delighted in attacking the Epicureans and Stoics. Strabo and Stephanus call him the &quot;earnest-jester&quot; (, &quot;spoudogeloios&quot;). His writings exercised considerable influence upon later literature, and the Menippean satire genre is named after him. Although the writings of Menippus no longer survive, there are some fragments of Varro&#x27;s &quot;Saturae Menippeae&quot;, which were written in imitation of Menippus. One of the dialogues attributed to Lucian, his avowed imitator, who frequently mentions him, is called &quot;Menippus&quot;, but since the sub-title (&quot;The Oracle of the Dead&quot;) resembles that of a work ascribed to Menippus by Diogenes Laërtius, it has been suggested that it is imitated from his &quot;Necromancy&quot;.

Diogenes Laërtius says the following works were written by Menippus:
* Νέκυια – &quot;Necromancy&quot;
* Διαθῆκαι – &quot;Wills&quot;
* Ἐπιστολαὶ κεκομψευμέναι ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν προσώπου – &quot;Letters artificially composed as if by the Gods&quot;
* Πρὸς τοὺς φυσικοὺς καὶ μαθηματικοὺς καὶ γραμματικοὺς – &quot;Replies to the Natural Philosophers, and Mathematicians, and Grammarians&quot;
* Γονὰς Ἐπικούρου – &quot;The Birth of Epicurus&quot;
* Τὰς θρησκευομένας ὑπ&#x27; αὐτῶν εἰκάδας – &quot;The School&#x27;s reverence of the twentieth day&quot; (celebrated in the Epicurean school)

In addition, Athenaeus mentions works called &quot;Symposium&quot; and &quot;Arcesilaus&quot;, and Diogenes Laërtius mentions a &quot;Sale of Diogenes&quot; () written by Menippus which seems to be the main source of the story that Diogenes of Sinope was captured by pirates and sold into slavery.

<doc id="248182" wikidata="Q1669228" url="?curid=248182" title="Space charge">
<text>Space charge is an interpretation of a collection of electric charges in which excess electric charge is treated as a continuum of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when charge carriers have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules left behind in the solid can form a space charge region.

Space charge effects are most pronounced in dielectric media (including vacuum); in highly conductive media, the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or screened. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a metal object when it is heated to incandescence in a vacuum. This effect was first observed by Thomas Edison in light bulb filaments, where it is sometimes called the Edison effect. Space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and solid-state electronic devices.

==Cause==

===Physical explanation===
When a metal object is placed in a vacuum and is heated to incandescence, the energy is sufficient to cause electrons to &quot;boil&quot; away from the surface atoms and surround the metal object in a cloud of free electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The resulting cloud is negatively charged, and can be attracted to any nearby positively charged object, thus producing an electric current which passes through the vacuum.

Space charge can result from a range of phenomena, but the most important are:

# Combination of the current density and spatially inhomogeneous resistance
# Ionization of species within the dielectric to form heterocharge
# Charge injection from electrodes and from a stress enhancement
# Polarization in structures such as water trees. &quot;Water tree&quot; is a name given to a tree-like figure appearing in a water-impregnated polymer insulating cable.

It has been suggested that in alternating current (AC) most carriers injected at electrodes during a half cycle are ejected during the next half cycle, so the net balance of charge on a cycle is practically zero. However, a small fraction of the carriers can be trapped at levels deep enough to retain them when the field is inverted. The amount of charge in AC should increase slower than in direct current (DC) and become observable after longer periods of time.

==== Hetero and homo charge ====
Hetero charge means that the polarity of the space charge is opposite to that of neighboring electrode, and homo charge is the reverse situation. Under high voltage application, a hetero charge near the electrode is expected to reduce the breakdown voltage, whereas a homo charge will increase it. After polarity reversal under ac conditions, the homo charge is converted to hetero space charge.

===Mathematical explanation===
If the near &quot;vacuum&quot; has a pressure of 10−6 mmHg or less, the main vehicle of conduction is electrons. The emission current density (&quot;J&quot;) from the cathode, as a function of its thermodynamic temperature &quot;T&quot;, in the absence of space-charge, is given by Richardson&#x27;s law:
formula_1
where
*formula_2
* = elementary positive charge (i.e., magnitude of electron charge),
* = electron mass,
* = Boltzmann constant = ,
* = Planck constant = ,
* = work function of the cathode,
* = mean electron reflection coefficient.

The reflection coefficient can be as low as 0.105 but is usually near 0.5. For tungsten, (1 − &quot;formula_3&quot;)&quot;A&quot;0 = , and . At 2500 °C, the emission is 28207 A/m2.

The emission current as given above is many times greater than that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some pulsed valves such as the cavity magnetron. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the repulsion of the cloud of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the &quot;space charge effect&quot;. In the limit of large current densities, &quot;J&quot; is given by the Child–Langmuir equation below, rather than by the thermionic emission equation above.

==Occurrence==
Space charge is an inherent property of all vacuum tubes. This has at times made life harder or easier for electrical engineers who used tubes in their designs. For example, space charge significantly limited the practical application of triode amplifiers which led to further innovations such as the vacuum tube tetrode.

On the other hand, space charge was useful in some tube applications because it generates a negative EMF within the tube&#x27;s envelope, which could be used to create a negative bias on the tube&#x27;s grid. Grid bias could also be achieved by using an applied grid voltage in addition to the control voltage. This could improve the engineer&#x27;s control and fidelity of amplification. It allowed the construction of &quot;space charge tubes&quot; for car radios that required only 6 or 12 volts anode voltage (typical examples were the 6DR8/EBF83, 6GM8/ECC86, 6DS8/ECH83, 6ES6/EF97 and 6ET6/EF98).

Space charges can also occur within dielectrics. For example, when gas near a high voltage electrode begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, electrical charges are injected into the region near the electrode, forming space charge regions in the surrounding gas. Space charges can also occur within solid or liquid dielectrics that are stressed by high electric fields. Trapped space charges within solid dielectrics are often a contributing factor leading to dielectric failure within high voltage power cables and capacitors.

In semiconductor physics, space charge layers that are depleted of charge carriers are used as a model to explain the rectifying behaviour of p–n junctions and the buildup of a voltage in photovoltaic cells.

== Space-charge-limited current ==

=== In vacuum (Child&#x27;s law) ===

First proposed by Clement D. Child in 1911, Child&#x27;s law states that the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a plane-parallel vacuum diode varies directly as the three-halves power of the anode voltage formula_4 and inversely as the square of the distance &quot;d&quot; separating the cathode and the anode.

For electrons, the current density &quot;J&quot; (amperes per meter squared) is written:
formula_5
where formula_6 is the anode current and &quot;S&quot; the surface area of the anode receiving the current; formula_7 is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and formula_8 is its mass. The equation is also known as the &quot;three-halves-power law&quot; or the Child–Langmuir law. Child originally derived this equation for the case of atomic ions, which have much smaller ratios of their charge to their mass. Irving Langmuir published the application to electron currents in 1913, and extended it to the case of cylindrical cathodes and anodes.

The equation&#x27;s validity is subject to the following assumptions:
# Electrons travel ballistically between electrodes (i.e., no scattering).
# In the interelectrode region, the space charge of any ions is negligible.
# The electrons have zero velocity at the cathode surface.

The assumption of no scattering (ballistic transport) is what makes the predictions of Child–Langmuir law different from those of Mott–Gurney law. The latter assumes steady-state drift transport and therefore strong scattering.

Child&#x27;s law was further generalized by Buford R. Conley in 1995 for the case of non-zero velocity at the cathode surface with the following equation:

formula_9

where formula_10 is the initial velocity of the particle. This equation reduces to Child&#x27;s Law for the special case of formula_10 equal to zero.

In recent years, various models of SCLC current have been revised as reported in two review papers.

=== In semiconductors ===

In semiconductors and insulating materials, an electric field causes charged particles, electrons, to reach a specific drift velocity that is parallel to the direction of the field. This is different from the behavior of the free charged particles in a vacuum, in which a field accelerates the particle. The proportionality factor between the magnitudes of the drift velocity, formula_12, and the electric field, formula_13, is called the mobility, formula_14:
formula_15

==== Drift regime (Mott–Gurney law) ====
The Child&#x27;s law behavior of a space-charge-limited current that applies in a vacuum diode doesn&#x27;t generally apply to a semiconductor/insulator in a single-carrier device, and is replaced by the Mott–Gurney law. For a thin slab of material of thickness formula_16, sandwiched between two selective Ohmic contacts, the electric current density, formula_17, flowing through the slab is given by:
formula_18
where formula_4 is the voltage that has been applied across the slab and formula_20 is the permittivity of the solid. The Mott–Gurney law offers some crucial insight into charge-transport across an intrinsic semiconductor,
namely that one should not expect the drift current to increase linearly with the applied voltage, i.e., from Ohm&#x27;s law, as one would expect from charge-transport across a metal or highly doped semiconductor. Since the only unknown quantity in the Mott–Gurney law is the charge-carrier mobility, formula_14, the equation is commonly used to characterize charge transport in intrinsic semiconductors. Using the Mott–Gurney law for characterizing amorphous semiconductors, along with semiconductors containing defects and/or non-Ohmic contacts, should however be approached with caution as significant deviations both in the magnitude of the current and the power law dependence with respect to the voltage will be observed. In those cases the Mott–Gurney law can not be readily used for characterization, and other equations which can account for defects and/or non-ideal injection should be used instead.

During the derivation of the Mott–Gurney law, one has to make the following assumptions:
# There is only one type of charge carrier present, i.e., only electrons or holes.
# The material has no intrinsic conductivity, but charges are injected into it from one electrode and captured by the other.
# The carrier mobility, formula_14, and the permittivity, formula_20, are constant throughout the sample.
# The current flow is not limited by traps or energetic disorder.
# The current is not predominantly due to doping.
# The electric field at the charge-injecting electrode is zero, meaning that the current is governed by drift only.

Derivation

Consider a crystal of thickness formula_16 carrying a current formula_17. Let formula_26 be the electric field at a distance formula_27 from the surface, and formula_28 the number of electrons per unit volume.
Then the current is given has two contributions, one due to drift and the other due to diffusion:
formula_29

When formula_30 is the electrons mobility and formula_31 the diffusion coefficient. Laplace&#x27;s equation gives for the field:
formula_32

Hence, eliminating formula_33, we have:
formula_34

After integrating, making use of the Einstein relation and neglecting the formula_35 term we obtain for the electric field:
formula_36
where formula_37 is a constant. We may neglect the formula_35 term because we are supposing that formula_39 and formula_40.

Since, at formula_41, formula_42, we have:
It follows that the potential drop across the crystal is:
 \left[ \left( L+x_0 \right)^{\frac{3}{2} } - x_0^{\frac{3}{2}}\right].&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Making use of () and () we can write formula_17 in terms of formula_4. For small formula_4, formula_17 is small and formula_47, so that:
Thus the current increases as the square of formula_4. For large formula_4, formula_50 and we obtain:
formula_51

As an application example, the steady-state space-charge-limited current across a piece of intrinsic silicon with a charge-carrier mobility of 1500 cm2/V-s, a relative dielectric constant of 11.9, an area of 10−8 cm2 and a thickness of 10−4 cm can be calculated by an online calculator to be 126.4 μA at 3 V. Note that in order for this calculation to be accurate, one must assume all the points listed above.

In the case where the electron/hole transport is limited by trap states in the form of exponential tails extending from the conduction/valence band edges,
formula_52
the drift current density is given by the Mark-Helfrich equation,
formula_53
where formula_54 is the elementary charge, formula_55 with formula_56 being the thermal energy, formula_57 is the effective density of states of the charge carrier type in the semiconductor, i.e., either formula_58 or formula_59, and formula_60 is the trap density.

==== Low voltage regime ====

In the case where a very small applied bias is applied across the single-carrier device, the current is given by:
formula_61

Note that the equation describing the current in the low voltage regime follows the same thickness scaling as the Mott–Gurney law, formula_62, but increases linearly with the applied voltage.

====Saturation regimes====

When a very large voltage is applied across the semiconductor, the current can transition into a saturation regime.

In the velocity-saturation regime, this equation takes the following form
formula_63

Note the different dependence of formula_17 on formula_4 between the Mott–Gurney law and the equation describing the current in the velocity-saturation regime. In the ballistic case (assuming no collisions), the Mott–Gurney equation takes the form of the more familiar Child–Langmuir law.

In the charge-carrier saturation regime, the current through the sample is given by,
formula_66
where formula_57 is the effective density of states of the charge carrier type in the semiconductor.

== Shot noise ==
Space charge tends to reduce shot noise. Shot noise results from the random arrivals of discrete charge; the statistical variation in the arrivals produces shot noise. A space charge develops a potential that slows the carriers down. For example, an electron approaching a cloud of other electrons will slow down due to the repulsive force. The slowing carriers also increases the space charge density and resulting potential. In addition, the potential developed by the space charge can reduce the number of carriers emitted. When the space charge limits the current, the random arrivals of the carriers are smoothed out; the reduced variation results in less shot noise.

<doc id="248189" wikidata="Q208184" url="?curid=248189" title="Gaia hypothesis">
<text>The Gaia hypothesis (), also known as the Gaia theory, Gaia paradigm, or the Gaia principle, proposes that living organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings on Earth to form a synergistic and self-regulating complex system that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for life on the planet.

The Gaia hypothesis was formulated by the chemist James Lovelock and co-developed by the microbiologist Lynn Margulis in the 1970s. Following the suggestion by his neighbour, novelist William Golding, Lovelock named the hypothesis after Gaia, the primordial deity who personified the Earth in Greek mythology. In 2006, the Geological Society of London awarded Lovelock the Wollaston Medal in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis.

Topics related to the hypothesis include how the biosphere and the evolution of organisms affect the stability of global temperature, salinity of seawater, atmospheric oxygen levels, the maintenance of a hydrosphere of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the habitability of Earth.

The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being teleological and against the principles of natural selection, but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as Earth system science, biogeochemistry and systems ecology. Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today many scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence.

==Overview==
Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms co-evolve with their environment: that is, they &quot;influence their abiotic environment, and that environment in turn influences the biota by Darwinian process&quot;. Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, &quot;Ages of Gaia&quot;, showing the evolution from the world of the early thermo-acido-philic and methanogenic bacteria towards the oxygen-enriched atmosphere today that supports more complex life.

A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called &quot;influential Gaia&quot; in the 2002 paper &quot;Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?&quot; by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the biota influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. temperature and atmosphere. This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer-reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through &quot;micro-forces&quot; and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of photosynthetic bacteria during Precambrian times completely modified the Earth atmosphere to turn it aerobic, and thus supports the evolution of life (in particular eukaryotic life).

Since barriers existed throughout the twentieth century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia paradigm have become better known to the Western scientific community. These scientists include Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin (1842–1921) (although he spent much of his professional life outside Russia), Rafail Vasil’evich Rizpolozhensky (1862 – ), Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky (1863–1945), and Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886–1963).

Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected emergent property or entelechy of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one at the end of the Archaean and the beginning of the Proterozoic periods.

Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the coordination of living organisms and maintain those conditions through homeostasis. In some versions of Gaia philosophy, all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called &quot;Gaia&quot;. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the coevolving diversity of living organisms.

The Gaia paradigm was an influence on the deep ecology movement.

==Details==
The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating complex system involving the biosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrospheres and the pedosphere, tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.

Gaia evolves through a cybernetic feedback system operated by the biota, leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth&#x27;s surface, essential for the conditions of life, depend on the interaction of living forms, especially microorganisms, with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth&#x27;s surface temperature, atmosphere composition and ocean salinity, powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.

The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of biogeochemistry, and it is being investigated also in other fields like Earth system science. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.

===Regulation of global surface temperature===

Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the Sun has increased by 25–30%; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins. Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a situation similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on Titan. This, he suggests, helped to screen out ultraviolet light until the formation of the ozone layer, maintaining a degree of homeostasis. However, the Snowball Earth research has suggested that &quot;oxygen shocks&quot; and reduced methane levels led, during the Huronian, Sturtian and Marinoan/Varanger Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid &quot;snowball&quot;. These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre Phanerozoic biosphere to fully self-regulate.

Processing of the greenhouse gas CO2, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability.

The CLAW hypothesis, inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a feedback loop that operates between ocean ecosystems and the Earth&#x27;s climate. The hypothesis specifically proposes that particular phytoplankton that produce dimethyl sulfide are responsive to variations in climate forcing, and that these responses lead to a negative feedback loop that acts to stabilise the temperature of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of its activities, such as the multiplication of greenhouse gases may cause negative feedbacks in the environment to become positive feedback. Lovelock has stated that this could bring an extremely accelerated global warming, but he has since stated the effects will likely occur more slowly.

====Daisyworld simulations====

In response to the criticism that the Gaia hypothesis seemingly required unrealistic group selection and cooperation between organisms, James Lovelock and Andrew Watson developed a mathematical model, Daisyworld, in which ecological competition underpinned planetary temperature regulation.

Daisyworld examines the energy budget of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies, which are assumed to occupy a significant portion of the surface. The colour of the daisies influences the albedo of the planet such that black daisies absorb more light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect more light and cool the planet. The black daisies are assumed to grow and reproduce best at a lower temperature, while the white daisies are assumed to thrive best at a higher temperature. As the temperature rises closer to the value the white daisies like, the white daisies outreproduce the black daisies, leading to a larger percentage of white surface, and more sunlight is reflected, reducing the heat input and eventually cooling the planet. Conversely, as the temperature falls, the black daisies outreproduce the white daisies, absorbing more sunlight and warming the planet. The temperature will thus converge to the value at which the reproductive rates of the plants are equal.

Lovelock and Watson showed that, over a limited range of conditions, this negative feedback due to competition can stabilize the planet&#x27;s temperature at a value which supports life, if the energy output of the Sun changes, while a planet without life would show wide temperature changes. The percentage of white and black daisies will continually change to keep the temperature at the value at which the plants&#x27; reproductive rates are equal, allowing both life forms to thrive.

It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired.

===Regulation of oceanic salinity===
Ocean salinity has been constant at about 3.5% for a very long time. Salinity stability in oceanic environments is important as most cells require a rather constant salinity and do not generally tolerate values above 5%. The constant ocean salinity was a long-standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known. Recently it was suggested that salinity may also be strongly influenced by seawater circulation through hot basaltic rocks, and emerging as hot water vents on mid-ocean ridges. However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth&#x27;s history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes.

In the biogeochemical processes of Earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas is: sodium (Na+), chlorine (Cl−), sulfate (SO42−), magnesium (Mg2+), calcium (Ca2+) and potassium (K+). The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater. There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. Considering the metallic composition of iron sources across a multifaceted grid of thermomagnetic design, not only would the movement of elements hypothetically help restructure the movement of ions, electrons, and the like, but would also potentially and inexplicably assist in balancing the magnetic bodies of the Earth&#x27;s geomagnetic field. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts are when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks are transported into rivers and deposited into the oceans.

The Mediterranean Sea as being Gaia&#x27;s kidney is found (here) by Kenneth J. Hsu, a correspondence author in 2001. Hsu suggests the &quot;desiccation&quot; of the Mediterranean is evidence of a functioning Gaia &quot;kidney&quot;. In this and earlier suggested cases, it is plate movements and physics, not biology, which performs the regulation. Earlier &quot;kidney functions&quot; were performed during the &quot;deposition of the Cretaceous (South Atlantic), Jurassic (Gulf of Mexico), Permo-Triassic (Europe), Devonian (Canada), and Cambrian/Precambrian (Gondwana) saline giants.&quot;

===Regulation of oxygen in the atmosphere===

The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth&#x27;s atmospheric composition is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life. The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than noble gases present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them.

The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of chemical equilibrium. Oxygen is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and crust. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event. Since the start of the Cambrian period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 40% of atmospheric volume. Traces of methane (at an amount of 100,000 tonnes produced per year) should not exist, as methane is combustible in an oxygen atmosphere.

Dry air in the atmosphere of Earth contains roughly (by volume) 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.039% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases including methane. Lovelock originally speculated that concentrations of oxygen above about 25% would increase the frequency of wildfires and conflagration of forests. This mechanism, however, would not raise oxygen levels if they became too low. If plants can be shown to robustly over-produce O2 then perhaps only the high oxygen forest fires regulator is necessary. Recent work on the findings of fire-caused charcoal in Carboniferous and Cretaceous coal measures, in geologic periods when O2 did exceed 25%, has supported Lovelock&#x27;s contention. 

===Processing of CO2===

Gaia scientists see the participation of living organisms in the carbon cycle as one of the complex processes that maintain conditions suitable for life. The only significant natural source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is volcanic activity, while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of carbonate rocks. Carbon precipitation, solution and fixation are influenced by the bacteria and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms&#x27; shells fall. Some arrive at the bottom of shallow seas where the heat and pressure of burial, and/or the forces of plate tectonics, eventually convert them to deposits of chalk and limestone. Much of the falling dead shells, however, redissolve into the ocean below the carbon compensation depth.

One of these organisms is &quot;Emiliania huxleyi&quot;, an abundant coccolithophore algae which may have a role in the formation of clouds. CO2 excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophorid life, increasing the amount of CO2 locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorids, if the CLAW Hypothesis turns out to be supported (see &quot;Regulation of Global Surface Temperature&quot; above), could help increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitation necessary for terrestrial plants. Lately the atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean algal blooms are also increasing.

Lichen and other organisms accelerate the weathering of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living organisms. When CO2 levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO2 by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere.

==History==

===Precedents===
The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The mythical Gaia was the primal Greek goddess personifying the Earth, the Greek version of &quot;Mother Nature&quot; (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = PIE grandmother), or the Earth Mother. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist William Golding, who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time (Bowerchalke, Wiltshire, UK). Golding&#x27;s advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry. Golding later made reference to Gaia in his Nobel prize acceptance speech.

In the eighteenth century, as geology consolidated as a modern science, James Hutton maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked. Later, the naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth&#x27;s crust. In the twentieth century, Vladimir Vernadsky formulated a theory of Earth&#x27;s development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian geochemist and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences. His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community.

Also in the turn to the 20th century Aldo Leopold, pioneer in the development of modern environmental ethics and in the movement for wilderness conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.

Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the environmental movement in general came as a side effect of the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph &quot;Earthrise&quot; taken by astronaut William Anders in 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission became, through the Overview Effect an early symbol for the global ecology movement.

===Formulation of the hypothesis===
Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California on methods of detecting life on Mars. The first paper to mention it was &quot;Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life&quot;, co-authored with C.E. Giffin. A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the Pic du Midi observatory, planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in chemical equilibrium. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets.

Lovelock formulated the &quot;Gaia Hypothesis&quot; in journal articles in 1972 and 1974, followed by a popularizing 1979 book &quot;Gaia: A new look at life on Earth&quot;. An article in the &quot;New Scientist&quot; of February 6, 1975, and a popular book length version of the hypothesis, published in 1979 as &quot;The Quest for Gaia&quot;, began to attract scientific and critical attention.

Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis, and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including oxygen and methane persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets&#x27; atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life.

Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis.

In 1971 microbiologist Dr. Lynn Margulis joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet. The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her advocacy of the theory on the origin of eukaryotic organelles and her contributions to the endosymbiotic theory, nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, &quot;The Symbiotic Planet&quot;, to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is &quot;not an organism&quot;, but &quot;an emergent property of interaction among organisms&quot;. She defined Gaia as &quot;the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth&#x27;s surface. Period&quot;. The book&#x27;s most memorable &quot;slogan&quot; was actually quipped by a student of Margulis&#x27;.

James Lovelock called his first proposal the &quot;Gaia hypothesis&quot; but has also used the term &quot;Gaia theory&quot;. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments and provided a number of useful predictions.

===First Gaia conference===
In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, &quot;Is The Earth a Living Organism?&quot; was held at University of Massachusetts Amherst, August 1–6. The principal sponsor was the National Audubon Society. Speakers included James Lovelock, Lynn Margulis, George Wald, Mary Catherine Bateson, Lewis Thomas, Thomas Berry, David Abram, John Todd, Donald Michael, Christopher Bird, Michael Cohen, and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.

===Second Gaia conference===
In 1988, climatologist Stephen Schneider organised a conference of the American Geophysical Union. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia, was held in San Diego, California, on March 7, 1988.

During the &quot;philosophical foundations&quot; session of the conference, David Abram spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while James Kirchner criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four:

* CoEvolutionary Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new.
* Homeostatic Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist.
* Geophysical Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics.
* Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific.

Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. &quot;Weak Gaia&quot; asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. &quot;Strong Gaia&quot; according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, &quot;to enable&quot; the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.

Lovelock and other Gaia-supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the Daisyworld Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms. Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model &quot;demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways&quot;.

Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts &quot;intentionally&quot; was a statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of teleologism ceased, following this conference.

===Third Gaia conference===
By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000, the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or &quot;types&quot; of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change.

The major questions were:

# &quot;How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?&quot;
# &quot;What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?&quot;
# &quot;How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for &quot;daisies&quot;? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be &quot;collaborated&quot; with using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?&quot;

In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from-equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise entropy production, and Axel Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: &quot;...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo&quot;; &quot;...the resulting behavior of a symbiotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis&quot;. M. Staley (2002) has similarly proposed &quot;...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions&quot;.

===Fourth Gaia conference===
A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, Virginia campus of George Mason University.

Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event. Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Corell, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott.

==Criticism==
After initially receiving little attention from scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, including Ford Doolittle, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists, the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a neo-Pagan religion. Many scientists in particular also criticized the approach taken in his popular book &quot;Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth&quot; for being teleological—a belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, &quot;Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the biota&quot;.

Stephen Jay Gould criticized Gaia as being &quot;a metaphor, not a mechanism.&quot; He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that &quot;mechanism&quot;, itself, is a metaphor—albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor—one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as autopoietic or self-organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agentic quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphors of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole. With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.

Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of greedy reductionism in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable.

===Natural selection and evolution===
Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by natural selection, stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, W. Ford Doolittle and Richard Dawkins separately argued against this aspect of Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the genome of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific. Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution. Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system.

Margulis argued in 1999 that &quot;Darwin&#x27;s grand vision was not wrong, &quot;only incomplete.&quot; In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena&quot;. She wrote that the composition of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around &quot;set points&quot; as in homeostasis, but those set points change with time.

Evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton called the concept of Gaia Copernican, adding that it would take another Newton to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian natural selection. More recently Ford Doolittle building on his and Inkpen&#x27;s ITSNTS (It&#x27;s The Song Not The Singer) proposal proposed that differential persistence can play a similar role to differential reproduction in evolution by natural selections, thereby providing a possible reconciliation between the theory of natural selection and the Gaia hypothesis.

===Criticism in the 21st century===
The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal &quot;Climatic Change&quot; in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it. Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from &quot;... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties&quot; to &quot;Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background&quot; to &quot;The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record&quot;. The CLAW hypothesis, initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of cloud condensation nuclei has improved. In 2009 the Medea hypothesis was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.

In a 2013 book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines, Toby Tyrrell concluded that: &quot;I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock&#x27;s originality and breadth of vision, and recognize that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it&quot;. Elsewhere he presents his conclusion &quot;The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works&quot;. This statement needs to be understood as referring to the &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; forms of Gaia—that the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the &quot;weakest&quot; form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia—Coeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment—are both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term &quot;Gaia&quot; in this sense and that those two forms were already accepted and explained by the processes of natural selection and adaptation.

==Anthropic principle==
As emphasized by multiple critics, no plausible mechanism exists that would drive the evolution of negative feedback loops leading to planetary self-regulation of the climate. Indeed, multiple incidents in Earth&#x27;s history (see the Medea hypothesis) have shown that the Earth and the biosphere can enter self-destructive positive feedback loops that lead to mass extinction events.

For example, the Snowball Earth glaciations appeared to result from the development of photosynthesis during a period when the Sun was cooler than it is now. These mechanisms will have some effect, but any understanding of glacial-interglacial cycles requires study of the variations in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the tilt of its axis of rotation, and the ‘wobble’ in that rotational movement which causes the periodicity in Northern Hemisphere insolation, thereby setting the Earth’s thermal regime. Including studies from the fields of mathematics and Earth science, the fields of geology and geography provide insight into the causes of ice ages. 
Meanwhile, the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, along with the oxidation of atmospheric methane by the released oxygen, resulted in a dramatic diminishment of the greenhouse effect. The resulting expansion of the polar ice sheets decreased the overall fraction of sunlight absorbed by the Earth, resulting in a runaway ice–albedo positive feedback loop ultimately resulting in glaciation over nearly the entire surface of the Earth. However, volcanic processes at this scale should be understood as relating to the pressure exerted on the Earth’s crust, and released during periods of ice sheet retreat. Breaking out of the Earth from the frozen condition appears to have directly been due to the release of carbon dioxide and methane by volcanos, although release of methane by microbes trapped underneath the ice could also have played a part. Lesser contributions to warming would come from the fact that coverage of the Earth by ice sheets largely inhibited photosynthesis and lessened the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the weathering of siliceous rocks. However, in the absence of tectonic activity, the snowball condition could have persisted indefinitely.

Geologic events with amplifying positive feedbacks (along with some possible biologic participation) led to the greatest mass extinction event on record, the Permian–Triassic extinction event about 250 million years ago. The precipitating event appears to have been volcanic eruptions in the Siberian Traps, a hilly region of flood basalts in Siberia. These eruptions released high levels of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide which elevated world temperatures and acidified the oceans. Estimates of the rise in carbon dioxide levels range widely, from as little as a two-fold increase, to as much as a twenty-fold increase. Amplifying feedbacks increased the warming to considerably greater than that to be expected merely from the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide: these include the ice albedo feedback, the increased evaporation of water vapor (another greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere, the release of methane from the warming of methane hydrate deposits buried under the permafrost and beneath continental shelf sediments, and increased wildfires. The rising carbon dioxide acidified the oceans, leading to widespread die-off of creatures with calcium carbonate shells, killing mollusks and crustaceans like crabs and lobsters and destroying coral reefs. Their demise led to disruption of the entire oceanic food chain. It has been argued that rising temperatures may have led to disruption of the chemocline separating sulfidic deep waters from oxygenated surface waters, which led to massive release of toxic hydrogen sulfide (produced by anerobic bacteria) to the surface ocean and even into atmosphere, contributing to the (primarily methane-driven) collapse of the ozone layer, and helping to explain the die-off of terrestrial animal and plant life.

According to the weak anthropic principle, our observation of such stabilizing feedback loops is an observer selection effect. In all the universe, it is only planets with Gaian properties that could have evolved intelligent, self-aware organisms capable of asking such questions. One can imagine innumerable worlds where life evolved with different biochemistries or where the worlds had different geophysical properties such that the worlds are presently dead due to runaway greenhouse effect, or else are in perpetual Snowball, or else due to one factor or another, life has been inhibited from evolving beyond the microbial level.

If no means exists for natural selection to operate at the biosphere level, then it would appear that the anthropic principle provides the only explanation for the survival of Earth&#x27;s biosphere over geologic time. But in recent years, this strictly reductionistic view has been modified by recognition that natural selection can operate at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy — not just at the level of individual organisms. Traditional Darwinian natural selection requires reproducing entities that display inheritable properties or abilities that result in their having more offspring than their competitors. Successful biospheres clearly cannot reproduce to spawn copies of themselves, and so traditional Darwinian natural selection cannot operate. A mechanism for biosphere-level selection was proposed by Ford Doolittle: Although he had been a strong and early critic of the Gaia hypothesis, he had by 2015 started to think of ways whereby Gaia might be &quot;Darwinised&quot;, seeking means whereby the planet could have evolved biosphere-level adaptations. Doolittle has suggested that &quot;differential persistence&quot; — mere survival — could be considered a legitimate mechanism for natural selection. As the Earth passes through various challenges, the phenomenon of differential persistence enables selected entities to achieve fixation by surviving the death of their competitors. Although Earth&#x27;s biosphere is not competing against other biospheres on other planets, there are many competitors for survival on &quot;this&quot; planet. Collectively, Gaia constitutes the single clade of all living survivors descended from life’s last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Various other proposals for biosphere-level selection include sequential selection, entropic hierarchy, and considering Gaia as a holobiont-like system. Ultimately speaking, differential persistence and sequential selection are variants of the anthropic principle, while entropic hierarchy and holobiont arguments may possibly allow understanding the emergence of Gaia without anthropic arguments.

<text>The Music of the Somali people () is music following the musical styles, techniques and sounds of the Somali people.

==Overview==

===Traditional Somali music===

Somali people have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore. 

Somali songs are pentatonic. That is, they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Oromo in Ethiopia, Sudan or the Arabian Peninsula, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (&quot;lahamiste&quot;), songwriters (&quot;abwaan&quot;), and vocalists (&quot;odka&quot; or &quot;voice&quot;). The Somali word for dance is &quot;ciyaar&quot;.

Traditional instruments prominently featured in the music of Somaliland include the oud lute (&quot;kaban&quot;). It is often accompanied by small drums and a reed flute in the background. However, heavy percussion and metallic sounds are uncommon in Somaliland. The riverine and coastal areas of Somalia use a wide variety of traditional instruments including:

*Membranophones: &quot;nasaro, mokhoddon and masoondhe&quot; (high and heavy drums), &quot;reeme, jabbu and yoome&quot; (small drums); 
*Aerophones: &quot;malkad and siinbaar&quot; (flutes), &quot;sumaari&quot; (double clarinet), &quot;fuugwo&quot; (trumpet) &quot;buun, muufe and gees-goodir&quot; (horns); 
*Idiophones: &quot;shagal&quot; (metal clappers), &quot;shanbaal&quot; (wooden clappers), &quot;shunuuf&quot; (vegetable ankle rattles), &quot;tenegyo&quot; (xylophone);
*Chordophones: &quot;shareero&quot; (lyre), &quot;kinaandha&quot; (lute), &quot;madhuube&quot; (thumb piano), &quot;seese&quot; (one-chord violin)

==History==
Somali popular music began with the &quot;balwo&quot; style, pioneered by Abdi Sinimo, who rose to fame in the early 1940s. This new genre then in turn created the Heelo style of Somali music. Abdi&#x27;s innovation and passion for music revolutionized Somali music forever.

Introduction of melody in modern Somali song is credited to Abdullahi Qarshe, who is recognised for introducing the kaban (oud) as an accompaniment to Somali music. Qarshe is revered by Somalis as &quot;father of Somali music&quot;. 

Many qaraami songs from this era are still extremely popular today. This musical style is mostly played on the &quot;kaban&quot; (oud). Prominent Somali kaban players of the 1950s include Ali Feiruz and Mohamed Nahari.

During the rule of the Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia), music was suppressed except for a small amount of officially sanctioned music. There were many protest songs produced during this period, pioneered by the people of Somaliland who were trying to gain independence from the government of Somalia, especially the genocidal Barre regime.

Bands such as Waaberi and Horseed have gained a small following outside of the country. Others, like Ahmed Ali Egal, Maryam Mursal and Waayaha Cusub have fused traditional Somali music with pop, rock and roll, bossa nova, jazz, and other modern influences.

Music recorded in the 1970s was preserved in Hargeisa, buried underground, and is now available at the Red Sea Foundation at the Hargeisa Cultural Center, and in Radio Hargeisa. The Barre dictatorial regime effectively nationalised the music scene, with bands and production under state control. Bands were operated by the police, the army and the national penitentiary. Female singers were encouraged more than was the case in most of East Africa. Most musicians had left the country before 1991. Hiddo Dhawr is now operating as the only live music venue in the city.

==Music institutions==
The first radio station in Somalia to air popular Somali music was Radio Kudu based in Hargeisa, modern-day Somaliland. The first song to be broadcast was composed by Guroon Jire in 1940 in English, Somali and Arabic, before being renamed the following year to Radio Somali. The head of the Music department was Mohamed Saeed (Guroon jire). Music is now regularly broadcast on the state-run Radio Mogadishu,a number of private studio named Sony Music Somalia a division of Sony Music Entertainment as well radio popular television networks such as Horn Cable Television (a private company which is based in Somaliland).

<text>CBC Radio One is the English-language news and information radio network of the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It is commercial-free and offers local and national programming. It is available on AM and FM to 98 percent of Canadians and overseas over the Internet, and through mobile apps. CBC Radio One is simulcast across Canada on Bell Satellite TV satellite channels 956 and 953, and Shaw Direct satellite channel 870.
A modified version of Radio One, with local content replaced by additional airings of national programming, is available on Sirius XM channel 169. It is downlinked to subscribers via SiriusXM Canada and its U.S.-based counterpart, Sirius XM Satellite Radio.

In 2010, Radio One reached 4.3 million listeners each week. It was the largest radio network in Canada.

==History==
CBC Radio began in 1936, and is the oldest branch of the corporation. In 1949, the facilities and staff of the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland were transferred to CBC upon Newfoundland&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation.

Beginning in 1944, the CBC operated two English-language radio services: the original network became the Trans-Canada Network, and a second network, the Dominion Network, was established with CJBC in Toronto as its flagship. With the exception of CJBC, all 35 stations on the CBC Dominion Network were privately owned affiliates. Its programming tended to be lighter than that of the Trans-Canada Network, carrying more American programming in its schedule. The Dominion Network operated only in the evenings, freeing affiliates to air local programming during the day.

Until 1958, the CBC was both a broadcaster, and the principal broadcast regulator in Canada. It used this dual role to take most of Canada&#x27;s clear-channel frequencies on the AM band.

In 1962, the Dominion Network was dissolved and within a few years CJBC became a French-language station broadcasting the programming of Radio-Canada.

In 1960, the CBC began running distinct programming on its three existing FM English-language stations, which had been providing simulcasts of programming on its AM stations. The stations, located in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, broadcast a monoaural FM signal. Programming consisted mostly of classical music. The stations were linked by CN/CP Telecommunications via land-line and microwave. This service was discontinued in 1962, but resumed in 1964 in stereo. Eventually, a national satellite-distributed network of stereo FM stations was established. In 1975, the FM network was called CBC Stereo, and the AM service was designated CBC Radio.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, CBC Radio increased its current affairs and documentary content with an initiative known as the &quot;Radio Revolution&quot;, using more ambitious, live coverage of news and current affairs including listeners as well as experts. The change began with national shows such as &quot;As It Happens&quot;. The change spread to CBC regional morning shows which developed three hours of live radio combining &quot;survival information&quot;, about news, weather and traffic, with interviews and documentaries about local and national issues. CBC Radio Winnipeg was the first to embrace the format followed by &quot;Information Morning&quot; in Halifax, a move which increased audience and attracted coverage in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

CBC Radio stopped running commercials in 1974. Until 1995, the network signed off the air between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. daily (5:00 a.m. weekdays on its Toronto flagship station, CBL)– in that year, it launched an overnight program, &quot;CBC Radio Overnight&quot;, which airs international news and documentary programs.
In the early 1990s, the CBC began offering selected programs on the Internet. In September 1996, the network formally launched live audio streaming of both CBC Radio and CBC Stereo.

Since the 1980s, many of the CBC&#x27;s AM stations moved to FM in response to complaints of poor AM reception. This meant that the old distinction between the AM &quot;Radio&quot; network and the FM &quot;Stereo&quot; network was no longer accurate, even though many of the FM &quot;Radio&quot; stations broadcast in mono only. As a result, on September 1, 1997, CBC Radio became CBC Radio One and CBC Stereo became CBC Radio 2 (it is now CBC Music). Although some Radio One stations still broadcast on AM as of 2018, because of issues with urban reception of AM radio signals many of the remaining AM stations have added FM rebroadcasters in major urban centres within their broadcast area.

===CBC Radio One today===
From 2004 until early 2007, CBC Radio One promotional spots were announced by Canadian actress Shauna MacDonald, also known as &quot;Promo Girl&quot;. Toronto-born Jeremy Harris took over from MacDonald. Until fall 2005, promos ended with one of two slogans: either &quot;Because sometimes a picture needs a thousand words&quot; or &quot;Hear the big picture&quot;. Until early 2015, the slogan was &quot;Canada Lives Here.&quot; The slogan was not replaced.

In the fall of 2021, CBC Radio One&#x27;s weekend evening programing was reorganized. With the removal of two-hour programs, with &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot; cancelled and &quot;Saturday Night Blues&quot; relegated to CBC Music, Saturday night programming features various music programs from CBC Music. In contrast, the Sunday night programming has the network&#x27;s various spoken-word narrative programs concentrated from 7 p.m. to 12 a.m. (Eastern).

Some CBC Radio One programs, such as &quot;As It Happens&quot;, air in the United States on some stations associated with Public Radio International. &quot;Definitely Not the Opera&quot;, &quot;Quirks &amp; Quarks&quot;, &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; are heard on some public stations in the northern United States. Some CBC-SRC programs were relayed on Radio Canada International for listeners abroad and others, such as the 2010 summer program &quot;Promised Land&quot;, have aired on Sirius Satellite Radio 169.

==CBC Radio One stations==
Only stations licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission as separate broadcast undertakings are listed below. Most—though not all—of these stations produce at least one local program. Most stations also have numerous rebroadcasters in smaller communities within their service areas; rebroadcasters are listed in each primary station&#x27;s article.


==Shortwave relays of Radio One==
Several shortwave radio relays of CBC Radio One once existed to provide coverage to remote areas that could not otherwise receive radio broadcasts. The only such operation still licensed is CKZN, relaying CFGB-FM from Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador with a 1 kW ERP signal on a fixed frequency of 6.16 MHz.

Former shortwave relays include CKCX, providing a relay of CBC North programming, and CKZU, relaying CBU from Vancouver. CKCX and CKZU ceased operations in 2012 and 2017, respectively.

==Programming==

Most schedules include hourly news readings that run from 4–10 minutes on the top of the hour except for major programming like the 6:00 p.m. news show, &quot;Your World Tonight&quot;, and the Sunday afternoon call-in show, &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot;. Some mid-day programs include only brief 90-second &quot;information updates&quot;.

On statutory holidays, local programming, particularly the morning shows, is replaced by special provincial programming or regional programs are broadcast province-wide on a rotating basis. Typically for the noon and late afternoon time slots, national programs in the form of documentary specials are aired as well. In the summer months of July and August, some programming is temporarily shortened and/or replaced by special summer series. For Christmas Day, the majority of the programming, beginning at 8:00 PM on Christmas Eve, is replaced with predominately holiday music showcases.

Stations in the Canadian territories air a significantly different schedule with expanded local programming that includes a number of programs in local Indigenous languages. They air most of the core CBC Radio One schedule, although some programs may air in abbreviated versions (see CBC North for further information).

The network also airs some programming syndicated from American public broadcasting services such as National Public Radio and Public Radio Exchange, including programs from the now defunct Public Radio International which merged with PRX in 2019, &quot;This American Life&quot;, &quot;Radiolab&quot; and the news series &quot;The World&quot; and, previously, &quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot;. With the exceptions of &quot;This American Life&quot;, which airs on Sunday nights at 11:00 p.m. and &quot;Snap Judgement&quot; which airs on Monday nights at 11:00 p.m., all other non-Canadian content airs after 1:00 a.m. as part of the &quot;CBC Radio Overnight&quot; programming block.

===Sirius XM===
The Radio One feed on Sirius XM Satellite Radio largely follows the Eastern Time schedule, and has no local programming, with repeats of other shows in time slots that would normally be occupied by local programming. As a consequence of using a single feed, most national programming outside the Eastern Time Zone is heard earlier or later than the regional outlet on terrestrial radio - for example: &quot;The World at Six&quot; is heard on Sirius XM as early as 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time in Vancouver, and as late as 7:30 p.m. Newfoundland Time in St. John&#x27;s.

Programs produced by NPR and PRX are not heard on CBC Radio One&#x27;s Sirius XM service, as these are covered by channels programmed by NPR and PRX. In addition, the programs featured on &quot;CBC Radio Overnight&quot; are not heard on the Sirius XM feed. In these cases, as with the regional programming slots, repeats of earlier national programs are heard, as well as some CBC Music programming (such as &quot;Deep Roots&quot;).

===Podcasting===
Many CBC Radio programs are also distributed in podcast versions. In addition, the service has also created several programs which are distributed exclusively as podcasts. Original podcasts include &quot;Campus&quot;, a program devoted to stories about college and university student life; &quot;Someone Knows Something&quot;, which presents information about criminal cold cases; &quot;Uncover&quot;, an investigative journalism project; &quot;Missing and Murdered&quot;, which delves into stories of missing and murdered Indigenous women; and &quot;Back Story&quot;, in which foreign correspondents talk about the news stories they have covered.

Selected episodes from the podcasts may also sometimes air terrestrially on CBC Radio One as substitute programs, or rerun material for regular programs such as &quot;The Current&quot;, such as during the summer season or when a regularly scheduled program is preempted due to a statutory holiday.

==Former affiliates==
While all CBC Radio stations today are owned and operated by the network there previously were a number of privately owned network affiliates of what is now CBC Radio One and its predecessors, the Trans-Canada Network, and the original CBC Radio network. Some were affiliates of the original CBC radio network prior to 1944, several of which had previously been affiliates of the CBC&#x27;s predecessor, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. Some were affiliates of the Trans-Canada Network (1944–1962) and either disaffiliated from TCN or became CBC Radio affiliates when TCN became CBC Radio in 1962. Some transferred their affiliation to CBC Radio when the Dominion Network dissolved in 1962. Most affiliates disaffiliated as the CBC built new owned and operated stations, expanded coverage by other stations, or built transmitters to rebroadcast existing CBC Radio stations. Other affiliates were purchased from their owners by the CBC and are listed under CBC Radio One stations above or at List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada if they are no longer operating.

<text>Asphodelus is a genus of mainly perennial flowering plants in the asphodel family Asphodelaceae that was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The genus was formerly included in the lily family (Liliaceae). The genus is native to temperate Europe (mostly the south of Europe), the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian Subcontinent, and some species have been introduced to, and are now naturalized in, other places such as New Zealand, Australia, Mexico and southwestern United States. Many asphodels are popular garden plants, which grow in well-drained soils with abundant natural light.

==Character==
The plants are hardy herbaceous perennials with narrow tufted radical leaves and an elongated stem bearing a handsome spike of white or yellow flowers. &quot;Asphodelus albus&quot; and &quot;A. fistulosus&quot; have white flowers and grow from high; &quot;A. ramosus&quot; is a larger plant, the large white flowers of which have a reddish-brown line in the middle of each segment.

==Etymology==
The genus name is derived from the Greek ἀσφόδελος &quot;asphodelos&quot;.

==Species==
There are 16 species in the genus.

; Species
# &quot;Asphodelus acaulis&quot; – Branched asphodel – Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia
# &quot;Asphodelus aestivus&quot; – Summer asphodel, also known as Common asphodel and Silver rod – Western Mediterranean (mainly Portugal and Spain)
# &quot;Asphodelus albus&quot; – White asphodel, also known as Rimmed lichen – Mediterranean
# &quot;Asphodelus ayardii&quot; – France, Spain, Italy, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Canary Islands
# &quot;Asphodelus bakeri&quot; – Western Himalayas of northern India, northern Pakistan, etc.
# &quot;Asphodelus bento-rainhae&quot; – Spain, Portugal
# &quot;Asphodelus cerasiferus&quot; – France, Spain, Sardinia, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia

# &quot;Asphodelus viscidulus&quot; – North Africa, Middle East, Arabian Peninsula

; Formerly included
* &quot;Asphodelus luteus&quot; – synonym of &quot;Asphodeline lutea&quot;

==Uses==
The leaves are used to wrap burrata, an Italian cheese. The leaves and the cheese last about the same time, three or four days, and thus fresh leaves are a sign of a fresh cheese, while dried out leaves indicate that the cheese is past its prime.

==Mythology==

In Greek legend the asphodel is one of the most famous of the plants connected with the dead and the underworld. Homer describes it as covering the great meadow (), the haunt of the dead. It was planted on graves, and is often connected with Persephone, who appears crowned with a garland of asphodels. Its general connection with death is due no doubt to the greyish colour of its leaves and its yellowish flowers, which suggest the gloom of the underworld and the pallor of death. The roots were eaten by the poorer Greeks; hence such food was thought good enough for the shades. The asphodel was also supposed to be a remedy for venomous snake-bites and a specific against sorcery; it was fatal to mice, but preserved pigs from disease. The Libyan nomads made their huts of asphodel stalks.

==Poetry==
The asphodel is mentioned by several poets in connection with the mythology of death, and by association, the afterlife - specifically the Isles of the Blessed and Elysium - part of the ancient Greek concept of the afterlife.

:* Conrad Aiken: &quot;Snowflake on asphodel—how clear, how bright / Snow&#x27;s death on dying flower, yet both immortal&quot;
:* Elizabeth Barrett Browning: &quot;As one who stands in dewless asphodel, Looks backward on the tedious time he had In the upper life.&quot;
:* Florence Earle Coates: &quot;beauty wove a magic spell/ For him, and early, at his need,/ Upon a bed of asphodel/ He found a tuneful reed&quot; in poem &quot;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&quot;
:* Leonard Cohen: &quot;But in his lapel, discreetly, he wore a sprig of asphodel.&quot;
:* William Faulkner: &quot;There asphodels are scattered through the night, Like ghosts of young beseeching hands.&quot; ONE WHO WAS LEFT LIVING, CHANSONS AU PRINTEMPS, handwritten with drawings, 1919, W. Faulkner, RFC
:* Robert Frost: “And where they sought without the sword/ Wide fields of asphodel fore’er” The Trial by Existence, A Boy’s Will
:* Allen Ginsberg: &quot;An Asphodel&quot;
:* Hesiod: &quot;Children! They know not how much more the half is than the whole, nor how great is the profit in mallow and asphodel.&quot;
:* Homer: &quot;So I said and off he went, the ghost of the great runner, Aeacus’ grandson loping with long strides across the fields of asphodel, triumphant in all I had told him of his son, his gallant, glorious son.&quot;
:* Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: &quot;He, who wore the crown of asphodels, Descending, at my door began to knock.&quot;
:* John Milton: &quot;To embathe In nectared lavers strewed with asphodel.&quot;
:* Edgar Allan Poe: &quot;and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel&quot;
:* Alexander Pope: &quot;Happy Souls who dwell In Yellow Meads of Asphodel, Or Amaranthine Bowers.&quot;
:* Ezra Pound, &quot;Canto XXI&quot;: &quot;Danced there Athame, danced, and there Phaethusa/ With colour in the vein,/ Strong as with blood drink, once,/ With colour in the vein/ Red in the smoke-faint throat. Dis caught her up./ And the old man went on there/ beating his mule with an asphodel.&quot;
:* Alfred Tennyson: &quot;Others in Elysian valleys dwell, Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.&quot;
:* Orville E. Watson: &quot;see a river like Kokosing, in meadows sweet with asphodel&quot;
:* William Carlos Williams: &quot;Asphodel, that greeny flower&quot;
:* Marie Laforêt: &quot;Je t&#x27;ai donné mes bouquets d&#x27;asphodèles
:* Oscar Wilde: &quot;The heavy fields of scentless Asphodel, the loveless lips with which men kiss in hell&quot;; &quot;they sleep, they sleep, beneath the rocking trees where asphodel and yellow lotus twine&quot;
:* Dani Filth: &quot;When the Sun goes out our powers/ Will extend throughout Heaven like Asphodel&quot;
:* Virginia Woolf: &quot; But some were early infected by a germ said to be bred of the pollen of the asphodel&quot; (describing the love of literature in )

<text>Clarence Anicholas Clemons Jr. (January 11, 1942 – June 18, 2011), also known as The Big Man, was an American saxophonist. From 1972 until his death in 2011, he was the saxophonist for Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band.

Clemons released several solo albums. In 1985, he had a hit single with &quot;You&#x27;re a Friend of Mine&quot;, a duet with Jackson Browne. As a guest musician, he featured on Aretha Franklin&#x27;s song &quot;Freeway of Love&quot;. As an actor, Clemons appeared in several films, including &quot;New York, New York&quot; and &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;. He also made cameo appearances in several TV series, including &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot;. Clemons published &quot;Big Man: Real Life &amp; Tall Tales&quot; (2009) with his friend Don Reo. The book is a semi-fictional autobiography told in the third person.

Clemons died in 2011 at the age of 69. In 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band.

==Early life==
Clarence Anicholas Clemons Jr. was born on January 11, 1942, in Norfolk County, Virginia (later the city of Chesapeake), the son of fish market owner Clarence Clemons, Sr., and his wife Thelma. He was the oldest of their three children. His grandfather was a Baptist preacher and, as a result, the young Clemons grew up in a very religious environment listening to gospel music. When he was nine, his father gave him an alto saxophone as a Christmas present and paid for music lessons. He later switched to tenor saxophone and played in a high school jazz band. His uncle also influenced his early musical development when he bought him his first King Curtis album. Curtis, and his work with the Coasters in particular, would become a major influence on Clemons and led to him switching to tenor saxophone.

As a youth, Clemons also showed potential as a football player, and graduated from Crestwood High School (now Crestwood Middle) before attending Maryland State College on both music and football scholarships. At 6&#x27; 4&quot; and 240 pounds, he played as a lineman on the same team as Art Shell and Emerson Boozer and attracted the attention of the Cleveland Browns, who offered him a trial. Clemons also tried out for the Dallas Cowboys. However, the day before, he was involved in a serious car accident which effectively ended any plans of a career in the National Football League. He would eventually be posthumously inducted into the university&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame on February 24, 2012.

At age 18, Clemons had one of his earliest studio experiences, recording sessions with Tyrone Ashley&#x27;s Funky Music Machine, a band from Plainfield, New Jersey, that included Ray Davis, Eddie Hazel and Billy Bass Nelson, all of whom later played with Parliament-Funkadelic. He also performed with Daniel Petraitis, a New Jersey and Nashville legend. These sessions were eventually released in 2007 by Truth and Soul Records as &quot;Let Me Be Your Man&quot;. While at Maryland State College, Clemons also joined his first band, the Vibratones, which played James Brown covers and stayed together for about four years between 1961 and 1965. While still playing with this band, he moved to Somerset, New Jersey, where he worked as a counselor for children at the Jamesburg Training School for Boys, a youth detention center, between 1962 and 1970.

==Music career==
===E Street Band===
The story of how Clemons first met Bruce Springsteen has entered into E Street Band mythology. &quot;The E Street Shuffle&quot; contains a monologue about how they met, and the event was also immortalized in &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;. They allegedly met for the first time in September 1971. At the time, Clemons was playing with Norman Seldin &amp; the Joyful Noyze at The Wonder Bar in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Seldin was a Jersey Shore musician/entrepreneur who, as well as playing piano and leading various bands, had his own record label, Selsom Records. In 1969, Clemons had recorded an eponymous album with this band. In 2008, tracks from this album were reissued on an anthology, &quot;Asbury Park — Then and Now&quot;, put together by Seldin. It was Karen Cassidy, lead vocalist with the Joyful Noyze, who encouraged Clemons to check out Springsteen, who was playing with the Bruce Springsteen Band at the nearby Student Prince. Clemons recalled their meeting in various interviews:

However, well before this meeting, Clemons and Springsteen had moved within the same circle of musical acquaintances. Norman Seldin had managed and promoted several local bands, including The Motifs who featured Vinnie Roslin, later to play with Springsteen in Steel Mill. On April 22, 1966, Seldin had also organized a Battle of the Bands competition at the Matawan-Keyport Roller Drome in Matawan, New Jersey. Springsteen was among the entrants playing with his then band, The Castiles. Billy Ryan, who played lead guitar with The Joyful Noyze, also played in The Jaywalkers with Garry Tallent and Steve Van Zandt. Clemons himself had also played with Tallent in Little Melvin &amp; The Invaders.

In July 1972, Springsteen began recording his debut album &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; and during breaks from recording, he jammed with Clemons and The Joyful Noyze on at least two occasions at The Shipbottom Lounge in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. When Springsteen then decided to use a tenor saxophone on the songs &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot;, he called Clemons. By October Springsteen was ready to tour and promote &quot;Greetings…&quot; and he put together a band featuring Clemons, Tallent, Danny Federici and Vini Lopez. Clemons played his last gig with Norman Seldin &amp; The Joyful Noyze at the Club Plaza in Bayville, New Jersey, on October 21, 1972. Four days later Clemons made his debut with the formative E Street Band at an unadvertised, impromptu performance at The Shipbottom Lounge.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Clemons featured prominently on Springsteen&#x27;s albums. On &quot;Born to Run&quot; he provided memorable saxophone solos on the title track, &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;, &quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Jungleland&quot;. &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; featured notable solos by Clemons on &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;The Promised Land&quot;. &quot;The River&quot; saw Clemons featured on songs such as &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, &quot;Sherry Darling&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Marry You&quot;, &quot;Drive All Night&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot; while &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; saw solos on &quot;Bobby Jean&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down&quot;.

Springsteen and other members of the band referred to Clemons as &quot;The Big Man&quot;. At the end of shows, while recognizing members of the E Street Band, Springsteen referred to Clemons as &quot;The Biggest Man You Ever Seen&quot;. He sometimes changed this depending on where the E Street Band performs — at their 2009 concert in Glasgow he introduced Clemons as &quot;the biggest Scotsman you&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

In April 2014, the E Street Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Clemons&#x27; widow accepted on his behalf.

===Solo career and other projects===

Outside of his work with the E Street Band, Clemons recorded with many other artists and had a number of musical projects on his own. The best known of these are his 1985 vocal duet with Jackson Browne on the Top-20 hit single &quot;You&#x27;re a Friend of Mine&quot;, and his saxophone work on Aretha Franklin&#x27;s 1985 Top-10 hit single &quot;Freeway of Love&quot;. He was managed briefly in the 1980s by former Crawdaddy editor Peter Knobler, at whose wedding Clemons played with his band, Clarence Clemons &amp; the Red Bank Rockers. During the 1980s, Clemons also owned a Red Bank, New Jersey, nightclub called Big Man&#x27;s West. He toured in the first incarnation of Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band in 1989, singing &quot;You&#x27;re a Friend of Mine&quot; (dueting with Billy Preston) and an updated rap arrangement of &quot;Quarter to Three.&quot;

In the late 1980s, he developed a friendship with Jerry Garcia and played a number of concerts with the Grateful Dead, including notable appearances during their New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in 1988, an AIDS benefit concert in May 1989, and a live pay-per-view broadcast of their summer solstice concert on June 21, 1989. Clemons also did a tour with the Jerry Garcia Band. One of these performances, from September 16, 1989 was officially released in 2020 as &quot;Garcia Live Volume 13&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, he recorded a Japan-only CD release called &quot;Aja and the Big Man &quot;Get It On&quot;&quot; with Los Angeles singer/songwriter Aja Kim. In 1992 he was involved in the sessions for the album Zoom by Alvin Lee. At this time he also recorded an instrumental record with Alan Niven producing, &quot;Peacemaker&quot;.

In the 2000s, Clemons along with producer Narada Michael Walden, put together a group called The Temple of Soul, releasing a single called &quot;Anna&quot;. He also recorded with philanthropic teen band Creation. Clemons collaborated with Lady Gaga on the songs &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Glory&quot; from her album &quot;Born This Way&quot;, providing a saxophone track and solo. In April 2011, Clemons sat in on several tunes with the Grateful Dead &quot;spinoff&quot; band Furthur during a concert in Boca Raton, Florida. Just days before he suffered a major stroke, he shot a music video with Lady Gaga for &quot;The Edge of Glory&quot;.

== Acting career ==

Clemons appeared in several movies and on television, making his screen debut in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1977 musical film &quot;New York, New York&quot;, in which he played a trumpet player. He played one of the &#x27;Three Most Important People In The World&#x27; in the 1989 comedy film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;. In 1985, Clemons was a special guest star in &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; episode &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock Star&quot;, in which he played the role of Mr. Kingsley, a young saxophonist helping Arnold Jackson to learn to play his sax.

In 1990, he co-starred in the pilot episode of &quot;Human Target&quot;, a Rick Springfield action series intended for ABC. He played the role of Jack in &quot;Swing&quot; starring opposite Lisa Stansfield and Hugo Speer, directed by Nick Mead. He appeared alongside Michael McKean and David Bowe as a miner in one episode of musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s children&#x27;s television show &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;. Clemons is a guest voice in &quot;Grift of the Magi&quot;, a 1999 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He made a cameo appearance in the sequel to &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1999), as part of the metal section of super blues band The Louisiana Gator Boys. He appeared in the episode &quot;Michael&#x27;s Band&quot; of Damon Wayans&#x27; television show &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; as a musician, and performed &quot;One Shadow In The Sun&quot;, an original composition co-written with bassist Lynn Woolever.

Clemons twice appeared as a Baltimore youth-program organizer in the HBO crime drama &quot;The Wire&quot;. He appeared in an episode of &quot;Brothers&quot; and in the &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Book&quot; episode of &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot; as himself.

==Other work==
Clemons published &quot;Big Man: Real Life &amp; Tall Tales&quot; (2009) with his friend Don Reo. It is a semi-fictional autobiography told in the third person.

==Personal life and death==
Clarence Clemons was married five times. He fathered four sons: Charles, Christopher, Jarod, and Clarence III (known as Nick). His nephew, Jake Clemons, was introduced as the new saxophone player of the E Street Band in 2012 after Clemons&#x27; death.

Clemons resided in Florida where he became involved with charitable organizations. Although he considered himself a Baptist, Clemons was also associated with spiritual guru Sri Chinmoy, who gave him the spiritual name Mokshagun. His songwriting and performing are credited to Mokshagun Clarence Clemons on his 1985 album &quot;Hero&quot;.

Clemons had his knees and his hips replaced. He also had surgery for a detached retina and suffered from chronic pain. Clemons described his final tour with the E Street Band as &quot;pure hell&quot; due to his health challenges. Following that tour, he had his knees replaced a second time and also underwent spinal fusion surgery. In the summer of 2011, Clemens had surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome.
Clemons suffered a massive stroke at his home in Florida, on June 12, 2011. While initial signs had been hopeful after his hospitalization and two subsequent brain surgeries, his condition worsened later in the week, and he died on June 18 at age 69. Upon announcement of his death, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ordered state flags to be lowered to half staff in his honor.

Following his death, Clemons&#x27;s family sued his physicians for medical malpractice, claiming that mismanagement of his medications led to his stroke.

==Tributes and legacy==
Springsteen said of Clemons: &quot;He carried within him a love of people that made them love him... with Clarence at my side my band and I were able to tell a story far deeper than those simply contained in our music.&quot;

At their concert in Portsmouth, Virginia, on June 19, 2011, Phish covered &quot;Thunder Road&quot; as a tribute to Clemons. At an Eddie Vedder concert in Hartford, Connecticut, on June 18, 2011, upon hearing of Clemons&#x27; health struggles, Vedder wished Clemons well, and Vedder was soon notified by a sound tech that Clemons had died. Vedder later played a tribute to Clemons during the Pearl Jam song &quot;Better Man&quot;, changing the lyrics to include, &quot;Can&#x27;t find a Bigger Man&quot; (paying homage to Clemons&#x27; nickname &quot;The Big Man&quot;). During a subsequent performance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Vedder played a ukulele with &quot;Clarence&quot; written across the front of it. Before singing &quot;Moment of Surrender&quot; at the U2 concert in Anaheim on June 18, 2011, Bono paid tribute to Clemons. He read lyrics from Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Jungleland&quot; near the end of the song, and repeated them at the song&#x27;s conclusion. Bono repeated this dedication and tribute during &quot;Moment of Surrender&quot; at the U2 concert in New Jersey on June 21 and again in Baltimore on June 22. Bon Jovi performed &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; as the first encore during their concert in Horsens on June 19, 2011. While playing that song, photos of Clemons were shown on the giant video screen behind the band. Jimmy Buffett added verses that included Clemons in &quot;The Stories We Could Tell&quot; during his final encore during his concert on June 21, 2011. The rest of the band left the stage and it was Buffett playing and singing alone. During the Gaslight Anthem&#x27;s set at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, frontman Brian Fallon dedicated their song &quot;The &#x27;59 Sound&quot; to Clemons. In October 2011, Lady Gaga paid tribute to him when she accepted the &quot;Big Man of the Year&quot; from Little Kids Rock. In a June 21, 2012, concert in Sydney, Gaga dedicated her song &quot;The Edge of Glory&quot; in which Clemons had contributed.

On July 17, 2011, a tribute concert was held at the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Springsteen performed a 45-minute set playing some of Clemons&#x27; songs. Clemons&#x27; son, Clarence III, (known as Nick), opened the show with his band, The Nick Clemons Band. On October 1, 2011, a tribute to Clemons took place at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Traditionally an annual charity event hosted by Clemons called The Classic Rock &amp; Roll Party, the event paid tribute to Clemons&#x27; life and all he did for Home Safe, a non-profit organization helping victims of child abuse and domestic violence.

In January 2012, Clemons&#x27; hometown paid tribute with memorial concerts featuring members of the E Street Band. The concert took place at The NorVa concert hall. On July 28, 2012, in Gothenburg, Springsteen and the E Street Band performed &quot;Jungleland&quot; for the first time on the Wrecking Ball World Tour, with Clemons&#x27; nephew Jake Clemons playing the saxophone solo and the song being dedicated to Clemons.

A documentary about his life directed by Nick Mead, titled &quot;Clarence Clemons: Who Do I Think I Am?&quot; was released in August 2019.

<text>is a legendary Japanese sword and one of three Imperial Regalia of Japan. It was originally called , but its name was later changed to the more popular (&quot;Grass-Cutting Sword&quot;). In folklore, the sword represents the virtue of valor.

==Legends==
The history of the extends into legend. According to , the god Susanoo encountered a grieving family of (&quot;gods of the land&quot;) headed by in Izumo Province. When Susanoo inquired of Ashinazuchi, he told him that his family was being terrorized by the fearsome Yamata no Orochi, an eight-headed serpent of Koshi, who had consumed seven of the family&#x27;s eight daughters, and that the creature was coming for his final daughter, . Susanoo investigated the creature, and after an abortive encounter he returned with a plan to defeat it. In return, he asked for Kushinada-hime&#x27;s hand in marriage, which was agreed. Transforming her temporarily into a comb (one interpreter reads this section as &quot;using a comb he turns into [masquerades as] Kushinada-hime&quot;) to have her company during battle, he detailed his plan into steps.

He instructed that eight vats of (rice wine) be prepared and put on individual platforms positioned behind a fence with eight gates. The monster took the bait and put one of its heads through each gate. With this distraction, Susanoo attacked and slew the beast (with his sword ), chopping off each head and then proceeded to do the same to the tails. In the fourth tail, he discovered a great sword inside the body of the serpent which he called . He presented the sword to the goddess Amaterasu to settle an old grievance. The Nihon Shoki adds more to the story. It says Susanoo had Ame-no-Fuyukinu deliver the sword. A rite at Hinomisaki Shrine honors this delivery to this day.

Generations later, during the reign of the 12th Emperor Keikō, was given to the great warrior, Yamato Takeru, as part of a pair of gifts given by his aunt, Yamatohime-no-mikoto, the Shrine Maiden of Ise Shrine, to protect her nephew in times of peril.

These gifts came in handy when Yamato Takeru was lured onto an open grassland during a hunting expedition by a treacherous warlord. The lord had fiery arrows loosed to ignite the grass and trap Yamato Takeru in the field so that he would burn to death. He also killed the warrior&#x27;s horse to prevent his escape. Desperately, Yamato Takeru used the to cut back the grass and remove fuel from the fire, but in doing so, he discovered that the sword enabled him to control the wind and cause it to move in the direction of his swing. Taking advantage of this magic, Yamato Takeru used his other gift, fire strikers, to enlarge the fire in the direction of the lord and his men, and he used the winds controlled by the sword to sweep the blaze toward them. In triumph, Yamato Takeru renamed the sword (&quot;Grass-Cutting Sword&quot;) to commemorate his narrow escape and victory. Eventually, Yamato Takeru married and later fell in battle against a monster, after ignoring his wife&#x27;s advice to take the sword with him.

==Folklore==
Although the sword is mentioned in the , this book is a collection of Japanese myths and is not considered a historical document. The first reliable historical mention of the sword is in the . Although the also contains mythological stories that are not considered reliable history, it records some events that were contemporary or nearly contemporary to its writing, and these sections of the book are considered historical. In the , the Kusanagi was removed from the Imperial palace in 688, and moved to Atsuta Shrine after the sword was blamed for causing Emperor Tenmu to fall ill. Along with the jewel () and the mirror (), it is one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan, the sword representing the virtue of valor.

 is allegedly kept at Atsuta Shrine but is not available for public display. During the Edo period, while performing various repairs and upkeep at Atsuta Shrine, including replacement of the outer wooden box housing the sword, the Shinto priest Matsuoka Masanao claimed to have been one of several priests to have seen the sword. Per his account, &quot;a stone box was inside a wooden box of length , with red clay stuffed into the gap between them. Inside the stone box was a hollowed log of a camphor tree, acting as another box, with an interior lined with gold. Above that was placed a sword. Red clay was also stuffed between the stone box and the camphor tree box. The sword was about long. Its blade resembled a calamus leaf. The middle of the sword had a thickness from the grip about with an appearance like a fish spine. The sword was fashioned in a white metallic color, and well maintained.&quot; After witnessing the sword, the grand priest was banished and the other priests, except for Matsuoka, died from strange diseases. The above account therefore comes from the only survivor, Matsuoka.

In &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, a collection of oral stories transcribed in 1371, the sword is lost at sea after the defeat of the Heike in the Battle of Dan-no-ura, a naval battle that ended in the defeat of the Heike clan forces and the child Emperor Antoku at the hands of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. In the tale, upon hearing of the Navy&#x27;s defeat, the Emperor&#x27;s grandmother, Taira no Tokiko, led the Emperor and his entourage to commit suicide by drowning in the waters of the strait, taking with her two of the three Imperial Regalia: the sacred jewel and the sword Kusanagi. The sacred mirror was recovered in extremis when one of the ladies-in-waiting was about to jump with it into the sea. Although the sacred jewel is said to have been found in its casket floating on the waves, was lost forever. Although written about historical events, &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; is a collection of epic poetry passed down orally and written down nearly 200 years after the actual events, so it has questionable reliability as a historical document. 

Another story holds that the sword was reportedly stolen again in the sixth century by a monk from Silla. However, his ship allegedly sank at sea, allowing the sword to wash ashore at Ise, where it was recovered by Shinto priests.

==Current status==
Because no one is allowed to see the sword due to its divinity and Shinto tradition, the exact shape and condition of the sword has not been confirmed. The most recent appearance of the sword was in 2019 when Emperor Naruhito ascended the throne; the sword (as well as the jewel Yasakani no Magatama, the Emperor&#x27;s privy seal and the State Seal) were shrouded in packages.

Replicas of the sword were made as early as the 9th century, and the original is entrusted to Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya. According to Shinsuke Takenaka of the Institute of Moralogy, a 12th-century replica preserved in the Imperial palace is the one used in coronation ceremonies, probably due to the fragility of the original sword.

==Other emperors&#x27; swords==
The sword is always hidden because of its divinity, and it is put in a box and put up by the chamberlain at the time of the enthronement ceremony. However, the Japanese sword held up by the emperor&#x27;s chamberlain, which can be seen at various imperial ceremonies, is always close to the emperor as an amulet, and is called . has changed over time; at present, two made by swordsmiths Nagamitsu and Yukihira in the Kamakura period play the role. Apart from these swords, the Imperial Family owns many swords, which are managed by the Imperial Household Agency. For example, one of the , , is owned by the Imperial Family.

==The sword of the Crown Prince of Japan==
The Japanese crown prince has inherited two , or , and . While the sword is forbidden to be seen because of its divinity and is always kept in a box, the Crown Prince&#x27;s sword is worn by the Crown Prince with the traditional costume at an official ceremony of the Imperial Household.

The sword is the most important sword owned by the Crown Prince, given by the Emperor as proof of the official Crown Prince after the ceremony of his inauguration. Its origin is that it was given by Emperor Uda when Emperor Daigo became Crown Prince in 893, and the present, the sword is the second generation, made in the late Heian period. The sword is a made by Yukihira, a swordsmith in the Kamakura period, and the Crown Prince inherits it from the Emperor before his inauguration ceremony and wears it in various Imperial events except for the festival. This Yukihira sword is different from the Emperor&#x27;s .

<text>Skipton (also known as Skipton-in-Craven) is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. Historically in the East Division of Staincliffe Wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is on the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the south of the Yorkshire Dales. It is situated north-west of Leeds and west of York. At the 2021 Census, the population was 15,042. The town has been listed as one of the best and happiest places to live in the UK.

==History==

Evidence for prehistoric habitation in the Skipton area includes an &quot;important outlying group&quot; of cup and ring marked rocks on Skipton Moor, to the south-east of the town, and in the same area there is an enclosed Iron Age hilltop settlement.

The name Skipton means &#x27;sheep-town&#x27;, a northern dialect form of &quot;Shipton&quot;. Its name derives from the Old English &quot;sceap&quot; (sheep) and &quot;tun&quot; (town or village). The name is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The town was important during the English Civil War, and was the site of prisoner-of-war camps during the First and Second World Wars.

Skipton Castle was built in 1090 as a wooden motte-and-bailey by Robert de Romille, a Norman baron. In the 12th century William le Gros strengthened it with a stone keep to repel attacks from the Kingdom of Scotland to the north, the castle elevated Skipton from a poor dependent village to a burgh administered by a reeve. The protection offered by Skipton Castle during the Middle Ages encouraged the urbanisation of the surrounding area, and during times of war and disorder the town attracted an influx of families. It is now one of the most complete and best preserved medieval castles in England and is open to the public.

One of the oldest mills in North Yorkshire, High Corn Mill, is powered by the waters of Eller Beck. The mill dates to 1310 when it was owned by Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford; at that point it was transferred to the powerful Clifford family by the then King Edward II. 
Skipton became a prosperous market town, trading sheep and woollen goods. A market stemming from its formative years still survives. In the 19th century, Skipton emerged as a small mill town connected to the major cities by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and its branch Thanet Canal, (known locally as &#x27;Springs branch canal&#x27;). 

During the 20th century Skipton&#x27;s economy shifted to tourism, aided by its historic architecture and proximity to the Yorkshire Dales. Skipton was the seat of Craven District Council from 1974 until April 2023. The Skipton Building Society was founded in the town.

Skipton is twinned with the Bavarian town of Simbach and Erquinghem-Lys in France.


==Governance==

Skipton is part of the parliamentary constituency of Skipton and Ripon, which was created in 1983. Since its creation, the constituency has returned a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP). , the seat is held by Julian Smith, a former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Before 1983 Skipton had its own eponymous constituency.

From 1974 to 2023 Skipton formed part of Craven District, a non-metropolitan district, and was home of the offices of Craven District Council. In 2007, proposals to make North Yorkshire County Council a unitary authority, removing the layer of government represented by Craven District, were rejected. However the council was eventually abolished in 2023, being replaced by North Yorkshire Council.

Skipton has its own town council consisting of 16 councillors, formed by 4 members from each of the four wards within the parish boundaries, North, East, South and West. The council offices are based on the high street, upstairs in the Town Hall. The councillors elect a town mayor each year at an annual general meeting. For 2024 the town mayor is Councillor Mrs Sheila Bentley.

==Economy==
The town is known as the &#x27;Gateway to the Dales&#x27;, because of its close proximity to the Yorkshire Dales. As Skipton is the nearest and largest town to a significant area of the Dales, it attracts numerous visitors, particularly on market days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday). Owing to the town&#x27;s many independent shops and national chains, Skipton has received praise for its enduring individuality and character. In 2008, the Academy of Urbanism voted High Street the best shopping spot in Britain. The wide high street once hosted the sheep market, but now a general market is held there and livestock is auctioned at the Auction Mart on the western edge of the town.

The town is home to a number of hotels, holiday companies, cottage holiday firms and independent holiday lets. The town is the base for several recruitment agencies, environmental and engineering consultancies and financial and legal services. Skipton is a popular commuter town, with direct trains to Leeds, Bradford and London.
One of the town&#x27;s larger employers is Skipton Building Society, with its subsidiary companies. 

Chocolatier Whitakers, based in the town, was established in 1889 in nearby Cross Hills. Ida Whitaker began making chocolates there in 1903, taught by the wife of the vicar of Kildwick.

==Culture and community==
In 2014, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; judged Skipton as the &#x27;best place to live&#x27; in Britain. In 2017, an annual study of the nation&#x27;s happiness and wellbeing by the ONS found Craven – which includes the town of Skipton – reported the highest levels of happiness and life satisfaction and the lowest levels of anxiety among residents. In 2018, the town was again listed in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, in their report on the &#x27;Best Places to Live&#x27; in northern England. Additionally, the town was twice listed in the UK&#x27;s top ten happiest places to live in Rightmove&#x27;s &#x27;Happy at Home Index&#x27; in 2020 and 2023. In 2024, the town was again judged by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as one of the best places to live in the UK.

Events in Skipton include the annual heritage event &#x27;Skipton Sheep Day&#x27; which takes place on the first Sunday in July and celebrates the town&#x27;s association with sheep. The event takes place on the high street and features a petting zoo, educational shows and a variety of food and drink stalls.

Skipton has an annual gala on the second Saturday of June. The gala begins with a procession through the town centre featuring decorated floats, a marching band and classic cars. The procession ends in Aireville Park with live music performances, a firework display and a variety of stalls. The gala was first held in 1901 to raise money for the Skipton and District Cottage Hospital, but following the formation of the National Health Service, the gala continued raising money for local charities and non-profit-making organisations.

Skipton hosts a Christmas market during which the high street is closed to traffic and the regular market traders are joined by more than 50 additional stall holders. The event features entertainment, live music, a brass band, funfair and the switch-on of the town&#x27;s Christmas lights.

Skipton Car Show is held annually in June and attracts thousands of spectators. The free show sees hundreds of classic, vintage rare and exotic vehicles exhibited on the town&#x27;s closed high street. Police vehicles are also displayed alongside demonstrations from the town&#x27;s fire service.

Skipton Town Hall holds events and performances such as music, theatre and comedy, as well as markets and fairs. In 2021, the building received funding from the National Lottery and Craven District Council to undergo a refurbishment. It is also home to the Craven Museum &amp; Gallery which has won numerous awards and in 2024 was shortlisted for the Art Fund Museum of the Year Award.

The town has two theatres. The Mart Theatre located in Craven Cattle Mart opened in October 2005 with funding from the European Regional Development Fund, Yorkshire Forward, Craven District Council and the Arts Council England. It provides rural theatre, events and other facilities. Skipton Little Theatre is a smaller 70-seater theatre located on Clifford Street and operated by a not-for-profit group. The theatre is the home of Skipton Players, the town&#x27;s amateur dramatics society.

Craven Arts is an organisation founded in 2017 by experienced local artists which supports the arts and operates centres in the town for exhibitions, events and creative workshops. In December 2022, with funding from Craven District Council, English Heritage, Heritage Action Zone, Arts Council England and Architectural Heritage Fund, Craven Arts renovated the former Parish Church school located on Otley Street and opened an arts centre. Named &#x27;Craven Arts House&#x27;, the centre provides studio space, classrooms, meeting rooms, a community hall, green screen room and recording studio. The organisation also operates a small shop, on Otley Street, selling works from local artists. 

Skipton has a public library, and three bookshops; an Oxfam bookshop, selling secondhand books for charity, Keogh&#x27;s Books, a secondhand and antiquarian bookseller, and The Little Bookshop, sellers of new books. From 1979, the Box of Delights bookshop on Otley Street served the town for almost 40 years, before closing in 2018.

Skipton has a hospitality sector, with around 85 public houses, cafés, coffee shops, bars and restaurants. These establishments serve a wide range of food and drink in various settings, from restaurants specialising in world cuisines to traditional Yorkshire pubs.

The town is home to the independent Plaza Cinema on Sackville Street, a cinema showing a varied programme, from arthouse movies to big releases from major studios. The cinema plays host to Skipton Film Club and the annual Hinterlands film festival.

The town has four allotment sites. Three are operated by Skipton Town Council and include two large sites, one in the Middletown area and another on Broughton Road, alongside a smaller site at Burnside Chapel. A fourth independent allotment site is located behind the town&#x27;s Plaza Cinema.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer&quot;, with a history stretching back to 1853.

<doc id="248222" wikidata="Q155476" url="?curid=248222" title="The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)">
<text>The Fast and the Furious is a 2001 action film directed by Rob Cohen from a screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, based on the &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine article &quot;Racer X&quot; by Ken Li. The first installment in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise, it stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny Strong, and Ted Levine. In the film, undercover cop Brian O&#x27;Conner (Walker) infiltrates a street racing crew to investigate a series of hijackings and finds himself developing a complex friendship with the group&#x27;s leader, Dominic Toretto (Diesel).

&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; entered development in late 1998, its concept inspired by Li&#x27;s &quot;Vibe&quot; article about illegal street racing. Thompson and Bergquist wrote the original screenplay that year, with Ayer hired soon after. Various actors were considered for the roles of O&#x27;Conner and Toretto, with Walker cast in 1998 and then Diesel in early 1999, with the pair attending actual street races in preparation for the film. Principal photography began in July 2000 and finished that October, with filming locations primarily including Los Angeles and the surrounding area in southern California. Record producer BT was hired to compose the score.

&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; premiered at the Mann Village Theatre in Los Angeles on June 18, 2001, and was released in the United States on June 22, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences and the performances but criticism for its story: the film is considered Diesel&#x27;s, Walker&#x27;s and Rodriguez&#x27;s breakthrough roles. &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; grossed $207 million worldwide. The film&#x27;s success spawned a franchise, and it was followed by the sequel &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; in 2003.

== Plot ==

Outside Los Angeles, a heist crew driving three heavily modified Honda Civics hijack a semi-truck trailer carrying electronic goods and escape into the night along Terminal Island Freeway. Meanwhile, LAPD officer Brian O&#x27;Conner is sent undercover as part of a joint LAPD-FBI task force to locate the crew responsible.
Brian investigates Toretto&#x27;s Market &amp; Cafe managed by Mia, sister of notorious street racer Dominic “Dom” Toretto. When Dom&#x27;s crew arrivesVince, Leon, Jesse, and Dom&#x27;s girlfriend LettyVince becomes suspicious of Brian and picks a fight with him. Brian is promptly fired from his undercover job at Harry&#x27;s garage and banned from the market.

Brian brings a modified 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse RS to a car meet, hoping to find a lead on the heist crew. Dom arrives in his RX-7 and initiates a race. Without credibility, Brian wagers his car; he, Dom, and two other drivers race. Brian&#x27;s car malfunctions and Dom wins the race, but LAPD officers arrive, forcing Dom to flee. Brian rescues him, helping him escape, inadvertently venturing into territory held by a rival racing gang led by Johnny Tran and his cousin Lance. Tran and Lance destroy the Eclipse, and the two are forced to return to Dom&#x27;s home on foot. Dom reiterates that Brian still owes him a ten-second car.

Brian delivers a decrepit MK4 Toyota Supra to Dom&#x27;s garage, and the crew begins the process of restoring it. At the same time, he begins dating Mia and looks into Tran&#x27;s finances. While investigating one of Hector&#x27;s garages, Brian is discovered by Dom and Vince; he convinces the latter he is researching Tran&#x27;s gang&#x27;s vehicles in preparation for Race Wars.

In the process, the three discover a large number of electronic goods, which Brian reports to his superiors, LAPD Sergeant Tanner and FBI Special Agent Bilkins. Tran is arrested, but is found to have acquired the goods legally. An enraged Bilkins berates Tanner and Brian. Bilkins then informs Brian that the truck drivers have begun arming themselves to kill the hijackers and notifies him that he has 36 hours to find them, whom the former believes was Dom all along. Brian and Dom attend Race Wars, where Jesse wagers and loses his father&#x27;s MK3 Volkswagen Jetta in a drag race against Tran driving his Honda S2000. Jesse flees upon losing, resulting in a confrontation between Dom and Tran. Tran accuses Dom of being a narc, and the two fight before being broken up.

That evening, Brian witnesses Dom leaving with his crew to carry out the heist. Brian reveals his identity to a distraught Mia, convincing her to help him knowing their danger. Dom, Letty, Vince, and Leon attempt to hijack the truck; the driver fires on Vince, critically injuring him and running Letty off the road in the process. Brian and Mia catch up to help, but Brian is forced to reveal his identity when he calls for MEDEVAC to save Vince. Dom, Mia, Letty, and Leon flee the scene before the police arrive.

Later, Brian arrives to arrest Dom, but the latter demands he leave in order to save Jesse from the danger he&#x27;s in from Tran&#x27;s gang. Jesse arrives, pleading for help, but he is gunned down by Tran and Lance on motorcycles. Brian foregoes his arrest of Dom and gives chase to Tran and Lance, with Dom getting into his father&#x27;s 1970 Dodge Charger R/T to pursue Tran and avenge Jesse. During the chase, Dom runs Lance off the road before Brian accidentally kills Tran.

Brian then pursues Dom, and the two agree to a quarter-mile race over a railroad crossing. The race narrowly ends in a draw, but Dom is t-boned by a passing truck. Instead of arresting him, Brian hands over the keys to his Supra, reminding Dom he was owed a ten-second car. He walks away as Dom drives off.

In the post-credits scene, Dom is seen driving through Baja California, Mexico, in a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In 2000, actor Paul Walker had worked with director Rob Cohen on &quot;The Skulls&quot;. Cohen secured a deal with producer Neal H. Moritz for an untitled action film for Universal Pictures, and approached Walker and asked him to suggest his &quot;dream&quot; action film; Walker suggested a mash-up of the films &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990) and &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; (1997). Soon thereafter, Cohen and Moritz brought him the &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine article &quot;Racer X&quot; by Ken Li, published in May 1998, which detailed underground street racing operating in New York City, and suggested a story set to follow Walker as an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating the world of underground street racing. The screenplay was originally developed by Gary Scott Thompson and Erik Bergquist. David Ayer was brought into the project to help rework the script. Ayer changed it from the &quot;mostly white and suburban story&quot; set in New York to a diverse one set in Los Angeles.

Upon being offered the role, Walker signed on immediately. Eminem was offered the role, but turned it down to work on the film &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002), and Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale were also considered. Originally, the studio told the producers they would green-light the film if they could get Timothy Olyphant to play the role of Dominic Toretto. Olyphant, however, who had starred in the previous year&#x27;s car-themed film &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, declined the role. Olyphant said that he turned down the role as he thought the film would be &quot;stupid&quot;. Moritz instead suggested Vin Diesel, who had to be convinced to take the role even though he had only played supporting roles up to that point. The role of Mia Toretto was originally written for Eliza Dushku, who declined it, and Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jessica Biel, Kirsten Dunst, and Natalie Portman auditioned before Jordana Brewster was cast.

Moritz had difficulty choosing between the titles &quot;Racer X&quot; (after the article), &quot;Redline&quot;, &quot;Race Wars&quot; and &quot;Street Wars&quot;, but was ultimately inspired by a documentary on American International Pictures, which included the 1954 film &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. Moritz was traded use of some stock footage to its director, Roger Corman, in exchange for a license to use the title.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in various locations within Los Angeles and parts of southern California, from July to October 2000. Key locations included Dodger Stadium (the opening scene where Brian tests his Eclipse in the parking lot), Angelino Heights, Silver Lake and Echo Park (the neighborhoods around the Toretto house), as well as Little Saigon (where Tran destroys the Eclipse) and the San Bernardino International Airport (the venue for &quot;Race Wars&quot;, which attracted over 1,500 import car owners and enthusiasts). The entire last rig heist scene was filmed along Domenigoni Parkway on the southern side of San Jacinto/Hemet in the San Jacinto Valley near Diamond Valley Lake.

Before filming, both Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez did not have driver&#x27;s licenses, so they took driving lessons during production. For the climactic race scene between Brian and Dom, separate shots of both cars crossing the railroad and the train crossing the street were filmed, then composited together to give the illusion of the train narrowly missing the cars. A long steel rod was used as a ramp for Dom&#x27;s car to crash through the semi-truck and fly in mid-air. During filming, 78 cars were wrecked both on and off-screen, of which 3 cars were shown being destroyed in the film&#x27;s trailer alone.
During production, stunt coordinator and second unit director Mic Rodgers developed a vehicle named the “Mic Rig” in collaboration with special effects coordinator Matt Sweeney and the rest of the film&#x27;s special effects department.

=== Music ===

The film&#x27;s score was composed by music producer BT, mixing electronica with hip-hop and industrial influences. Two soundtracks were released for the film. The first one features mostly hip-hop and rap music. The second one, titled &quot;More Fast and Furious&quot;, features alternative metal, post-grunge and nu metal songs, as well as select tracks from BT&#x27;s score.

== Release ==
&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; premiered at the Mann Village Theatre in Los Angeles on June 18, 2001. It was then released to theaters in the United States on June 22, 2001.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on January 2, 2002. The DVD release sold 2.1 million copies during its first day of release, making it the second-highest single-day DVD sales of any film, behind &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. The film also made $18.65 million in video store rental revenue in its first week, a record at the time. It was later surpassed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. More than 5.5 million home video units were sold by April 2002. A second DVD release, dubbed the &quot;Tricked Out Edition&quot;, was released on June 3, 2003, and features &quot;The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;, a short film that set the tone of the film&#x27;s sequel. An abridged version of the short film is also on the sequel&#x27;s DVD release.

An alternate ending titled &quot;More Than Furious&quot; was filmed, in which Tanner drops Brian off at the Toretto house, where he encounters Mia packing, intending to move away. Brian reveals that he resigned from the LAPD, who let him go quietly, and that he wants another chance with her. When Mia tells him that it is not going to be that simple, Brian tells her that he has time. This ending was released in the collection bundle DVD version.

=== Merchandising ===
Racing Champions released diecast metal replicas of the film&#x27;s cars in different scales from 1/18 to 1/64. RadioShack sold ZipZaps micro RC versions of the cars in 2002. 1/24 scale plastic model kits of the hero cars were manufactured by AMT Ertl.

A video game was planned for a release in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox by Vivendi Universal. Two other video games were released in 2004: a mobile game and an arcade game both titled &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. The arcade game was ported to the Wii as &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; in 2007.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; earned $40,089,015 during its opening weekend and ranked #1 at the box office ahead of &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The film became one of the four consecutive Universal films of 2001 to gross $40 million in their opening weekends, with the others being &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, &quot;American Pie 2&quot; and &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. Its widest release was 2,889 theaters. During its run, the film made a domestic total of $144,533,925 along with an international total of $62,750,000 bringing its worldwide total of $207,283,925 on a budget of $38 million.

In the United Kingdom, the film ranked in second place at the box office behind &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, collecting $2.6 million during its opening weekend.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; has an approval rating of 54% based on 156 reviews, and an average rating of 5.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Sleek and shiny on the surface, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; recalls those cheesy teenage exploitation flicks of the 1950s.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen&#x27;s high-octane hot-car meller is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitationer, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an action picture that&#x27;s surprising in the complexity of its key characters and portents of tragedy.&quot; Vin Diesel&#x27;s portrayal of Dominic Torretto won praise, with Reece Pendleton of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; writing that &quot;Diesel carries the movie with his unsettling mix of Zen-like tranquillity and barely controlled rage.&quot; Future franchise director Louis Leterrier and star Jason Statham went to watch the film in Paris in 2001 while on a break from filming &quot;The Transporter&quot; (2002), and praised it.

Other reviews were more mixed. Susan Wloszczyna of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying that Cohen &quot;at least knows how to keep matters moving and the action sequences exciting.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a C, saying it &quot;works hard to be exciting, but the movie scarcely lives up to its title.&quot; Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a scathing review, calling it &quot;&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; without a cause. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; with gas fumes. &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; with skid marks.&quot; Paul Clinton of CNN wrote that Cohen &quot;created a high-octane, rubber-burning extravaganza&quot; but he criticized the film for &quot;plot holes you could drive the proverbial truck through&quot; and an &quot;idiotic&quot; ending.

=== Accolades ===

== Sequel ==

The film shattered box office expectations and a sequel, &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;, was green-lit immediately. Diesel and Cohen declined to return for the sequel, opting to develop the film &quot;XXX&quot; (2002), which starred Diesel in the lead role. To account for these changes, Universal commissioned the writers to create a standalone sequel with Walker in the lead and brought in John Singleton as the new director.

<text>Duke of Clarence was a substantive title created three times in the Peerage of England. The title [[Duke of Clarence and St Andrews]] has also been created in the Peerage of Great Britain, and [[Duke of Clarence and Avondale]] and [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Earl of Clarence]] in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The titles have traditionally been awarded to junior members of the English and British royal family, and all are now extinct.

== History ==
The title was first granted to Lionel of Antwerp, the second son of King Edward III, in 1362, as he had married a &quot;de Clare&quot; heiress with estates including Clare in Suffolk. Since he died without sons, the title became extinct.

The title was again created in favour of Thomas of Lancaster, the second son of King Henry IV, in 1412. Upon his death, too, the title became extinct.

The last creation in the Peerage of England was for George Plantagenet, brother of King Edward IV, in 1461. The Duke forfeited his title in 1478, after he had been convicted of treason against his brother. He allegedly met his end by being drowned in a butt of Malmsey (according to William Shakespeare).

A fourth creation in England was suggested and planned to take effect; the title of Duke of Clarence was going to be given to Lord Guilford Dudley, husband of Lady Jane Grey, upon her coronation, as she declined to make her husband king. However, she was deposed before this could take effect.

Two double dukedoms, of Clarence and St Andrews and of Clarence and Avondale, were later created for British royal princes. The title also took the form of an earldom for Queen Victoria&#x27;s son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, and his son Prince Charles Edward, the Clarence earldom being a subsidiary title.

==Nomenclature==
The title does not refer to the minor River Clarence in Pas-de-Calais, northern France, but is said by Polydore Vergil to originate from the manor and castle of Clare in Suffolk, the Caput baroniae of a feudal barony, which was held by Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, in right of his wife, the heiress Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster, ultimate descendant and heiress of the previous holder, the de Clare family; Clare was among the many estates which she brought to her husband. After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the holders of the title were also given titles named after Scottish places: St Andrews and Avondale.

==Duke of Clarence, first creation (1362)==
The title was first created for Lionel, a younger son of King Edward III who in 1352 had married Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster, the sole heiress via a female line of Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester. The name &quot;Clarence&quot; referred to the feudal barony of Clare in Suffolk, and as the holder of it (and others) by right of his wife Lionel was given that title.

== Family tree ==

==Possible future creations==
The Dukedom is currently vacant. While there was some speculation that it was one of the options available for Prince Harry upon his wedding with Meghan Markle, press reports also noted the Dukedom&#x27;s chequered past, including scandals and unfounded rumours of criminality related to Prince Albert Victor. Prince Harry was ultimately awarded the Dukedom of Sussex.

===Notes===
When a battalion is referred to as a battlegroup, it is not purely made up of units from the parent unit, but is an integrated team, combining armoured units with tanks, and mechanised infantry with infantry fighting vehicles.

Also, whilst 16 Air Assault Brigade is apparently the only fighting brigade listed with its own organic helicopter support in this order of battle, 3 Commando Brigade had the helicopters on board &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to call upon, and 7 Armoured Brigade wasn&#x27;t really air mobile as a formation. There were also the RAF Pumas and Chinooks mentioned above for transport purposes.

Special Forces elements of the British Army (Special Air Service) and Royal Marines (Special Boat Service) were also deployed but as the British government policy is not to comment on special forces activity, the exact details or elements deployed are officially unconfirmed.

The contribution of reservists to the deployment (some 9,500 of the 46,000 personnel involved in the warfighting phase and its immediate aftermath, the vast majority from the Territorial Army, and in significant number in the subsequent roulements) is understated by the order of battle, as the only units to deploy in their entirety were 202 Field Hospital (with augmentees from the other TA Field Hospitals), 131 Independent Commando Squadron of the Royal Engineers as well as A (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Squadron, W (Westminster Dragoons) Squadron of the Royal Yeomanry and two platoons from 710 (Bath and Laundry) Squadron of 166 Supply Regiment RLC(v). The remainder were augmentees, called up individually from their units (which therefore do not feature in the order of battle) and employed to bring many of the units listed above up to their war-fighting strength.

Finally, 3 Commando Brigade had a United States Marine Corps unit, 15th MEU under its command in the initial stages of the war. This went back to American command around 25 March.

==Roulements==

1st Armoured Division remained in theatre, controlling UK ground forces until June 2003, when 3rd Mechanised Division&#x27;s HQ arrived in theatre to take command of British forces. From December 2003 a series of composite HQs were established.

<doc id="248231" wikidata="Q1245053" url="?curid=248231" title="Duke of Kent">
<text>Duke of Kent is a title that has been created several times in the peerages of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, most recently as a royal dukedom for the fourth son of King George V. Since 1942, the title has been held by Prince Edward (born 1935), a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Earliest history==
A title associated with Kent first appears anciently with the Kingdom of Kent (or Cantware), one of the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that later merged to form the Kingdom of England. The Kings of Cantware (or Kent) date back to about 449. After 825, when the Kingdom of Kent was taken over by Egbert, King of Wessex, Kent became a dependency of Wessex and was ruled by sub-kings, usually related to the Wessex rulers. The titular kingship became something like the heir-apparent&#x27;s title, as Aethelwulf, Egbert&#x27;s son, became King of Kent in 825. By 860, Kent lost its status as a kingdom, becoming absorbed into Wessex.

==Earls of Kent==

The first title of Kent was that of the Earl of Kent in the Peerage of England. After the death of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, his son Leofwine (c. 1035–1066) became Earl of Kent sometime between 1056 and 1058.

After Leofwine&#x27;s death at Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror named his half-brother, Odo of Bayeux (c. 1036–1097), who was also Bishop of Bayeux, the new Earl of Kent. However, Odo was twice removed from this title. The first occasion was in 1082, when he was imprisoned; the second was in 1088, after aiding in the Rebellion of 1088, after which he fled England.

It was not until 1141 that the title returned, this time for William de Ipres; but he was deprived of the title in 1155. In 1227, it was revived for Hubert de Burgh, but became extinct with his death. In 1321, it was again revived for Edmund of Woodstock, and through the marriage of Joan Plantagenet to Thomas Holland, the title passed to the Holland family, which held the title until 1408. In 1461, it was revived for William Neville, and then in 1465 for Edmund Grey. The Grey family held the title until Henry Grey, 12th Earl of Kent, who was made Marquess of Kent in 1706 and Duke of Kent in 1710, died without male heirs in 1740. Just before he died, he was awarded an inferior replacement title of Marquess De Grey to allow this to be passed to his heir - his granddaughter (the Dukedom could not be inherited).

==Marquess, former Duke of Kent==
Henry Grey (1671–1740) succeeded his father, Anthony Grey, as the 12th Earl of Kent in 1702. In 1706, he was elevated to Marquess of Kent, along with Earl of Harold and Viscount Goderich. In 1710 he was elevated once again as Duke of Kent, and following the death of his sons, Marquess Grey (1740) with a special remainder to his granddaughter. Henry had one son and five daughters with his first wife, Jemima Crew (d. 1728), and one son and one daughter with his second wife, Sophia Bentinck (d. 1741). By the time of Henry&#x27;s death in 1740, both of his sons had died, Anthony (in 1723) and George (in 1733), leaving the Duke of Kent without a male heir. His granddaughter Lady Jemima Campbell would inherit two titles in her own right, Marchioness Grey and Baroness Lucas; but all Henry&#x27;s other titles, particularly Duke of Kent, became extinct with his death.

==Royal dukedom (1799)==
On 23 April 1799 the double dukedom of Kent and Strathearn was given, with the earldom of Dublin, to King George III&#x27;s fourth son, Prince Edward Augustus. Edward had only one legitimate child, a daughter, Princess Alexandrina Victoria (the future Queen Victoria). Upon Edward&#x27;s death in 1820, the dukedom of Kent and Strathearn became extinct, as he had no legitimate male heir.

==Royal earldom (1866)==
The next creation of a title of Kent was not that of Duke or Marquess, but rather that of Earl, with the creation of Prince Alfred (1844–1900), the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, as Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Ulster, and of Kent in 1866. The Duke of Edinburgh (who later became the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha) had only one son, Prince Alfred, who would have inherited his father&#x27;s titles had he not died before his father in 1899. With Prince Alfred&#x27;s death in 1900, the earldom became extinct.

==Royal dukedom (1934)==
In 1934, Prince George (1902–1942), the fourth son of King George V of the United Kingdom and Queen Mary, was created Duke of Kent, Earl of St Andrews and Baron Downpatrick. Prince George had three children before his death in 1942: Prince Edward, Princess Alexandra, and Prince Michael. Prince Edward, upon his father&#x27;s death, succeeded to his father&#x27;s peerages.

The current Duke of Kent has two sons. King George V&#x27;s letters patent of 30 November 1917 restricted the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and the titular dignity of &quot;Prince&quot; to the sons of the sovereign, the male line grandsons of the sovereign, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. Great-grandchildren of the sovereign in the male line enjoy the courtesy titles of the children of dukes. Therefore, the heir-apparent to the dukedom of Kent is George, Earl of St. Andrews (b. 1962). Lord St. Andrews married in 1988, and has three children. His son Lord Downpatrick (b. 1988) is second in line to his grandfather&#x27;s peerages. When Lord St. Andrews succeeds, the dukedom will cease to be a royal dukedom; as a great-grandson of a sovereign he will be styled &quot;His Grace The Duke of Kent.&quot; After Lord St. Andrews and Lord Downpatrick, the current duke&#x27;s younger son Lord Nicholas Windsor (along with his sons) is in remainder to the dukedom, as are the current duke&#x27;s brother, Prince Michael of Kent, and his son, Lord Frederick Windsor.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms anciently associated with Kent is that of a rampant white horse upon a red field. This is primarily associated with the Kingdom of Kent and possibly the earldom as well. Today, this is seen on the Council of Kent&#x27;s arms and flag. As a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, this is not the coat of arms of the present Duke of Kent. The coat of arms of the Duke of Kent consists of the following:

* Arms: those of the Royal Arms, differenced by a label of five points argent (silver, often depicted as white), the points charged with an anchor azure (blue) and a cross gules (red) alternately.
* Crest: On a coronet of four crosses-patées alternated with four strawberry leaves a lion statant guardant or (gold), crowned with the like coronet and differenced with a label as in the Arms.
* Supporters: The Royal Supporters differenced with the like coronet (as in the crest) and label as in the arms.

The standard of the Duke of Kent is a flag version of his arms. The personal badge of the present Duke of Kent is &#x27;E&#x27; encircled by the garter of the Order of the Garter, surmounted by a Type IV Princes coronet as in the Crest.

==Formal residence==
The Duke and Duchess of Kent currently live at Wren House in the grounds of Kensington Palace, but their office is based at York House at St James&#x27;s Palace.

<doc id="248234" wikidata="Q1568202" url="?curid=248234" title="Booby trap">
<text>A booby trap is a device or setup that is intended to kill, harm or surprise a human or another animal. It is triggered by the presence or actions of the victim and sometimes has some form of bait designed to lure the victim towards it. The trap may be set to act upon trespassers that enter restricted areas, and it can be triggered when the victim performs an action (e.g., opening a door, picking something up, or switching something on). It can also be triggered by vehicles driving along a road, as in the case of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

Booby traps should not be confused with mantraps which are designed to catch a person. Lethal booby traps are often used in warfare, particularly guerrilla warfare, and traps designed to cause injury or pain are also sometimes used by criminals wanting to protect drugs or other illicit property, and by some owners of legal property who wish to protect it from theft. Booby traps which merely cause discomfort or embarrassment are a popular form of practical joke.

==Etymology==
The Spanish word translates to &quot;stupid, daft, naïve, simple, fool, idiot, clown, funny man, one who is easily cheated&quot; and similar pejorative terms. The slang of , , translates to &quot;dunce&quot;. Variations of this word exist in other languages (such as Latin), with their meaning being &quot;to stammer&quot;.

In approximately 1590, the word began appearing in the English language as &quot;booby&quot;, meaning &quot;stupid person, slow bird&quot;. The seabird in question was the genus &quot;Sula&quot;, with their common name being boobies. These birds have large flat feet and wide wingspans for marine habitats but are clumsy and slow on shore making them easy to catch. The birds are also known for landing aboard seagoing vessels, whereupon they have been eaten by the crew.

The phrase booby trap originally applied to schoolboy pranks, but took on its more serious connotation during World War I.

==Military booby traps==

A military booby trap is designed to kill or injure a person who activates its trigger, or employed to reveal the location of an enemy by setting off a signalling device. Most, but not all, military booby traps involve explosives.

Part of the skill in placing booby traps lies in exploiting natural human behaviors such as habit, self–preservation, curiosity or acquisitiveness. A common trick is to provide victims with a simple solution to a problem, for example, leaving only one door open in an otherwise secure building, luring them straight toward the firing mechanism.

An example that exploits an instinct for self–preservation was used in the Vietnam War. Spikes known as punji sticks were hidden in grassy areas. When fired upon, soldiers instinctively sought to take cover by throwing themselves down on the ground, impaling themselves on the spikes.

Many purpose–built booby–trap firing devices exist such as the highly versatile M142 universal firing device (identical to the British L5A1 or Australian F1A1), or Yugoslavian UMNOP-1 which allow a variety of different ways of triggering explosives e.g. via trip wire (either pulling it or releasing the tension on it), direct pressure on an object (e.g. standing on it), or pressure release (lift/shift something) etc.

Most explosive booby traps use between 250 g and 1 kg of explosive. Since most booby traps are rigged to detonate within a metre of the victim&#x27;s body, this is adequate to kill or severely wound.

===Effects===
Booby traps are indiscriminate weapons. Like anti-personnel mines, they can harm civilians and noncombatants during and after the conflict. The use against civilians is prohibited by the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices, and the protocol also prohibits boobytrapping e.g. the wounded or dead, medical equipment, food, and drink.

===History===
A type of booby trap was referred to in an 1839 news story in &quot;The Times&quot;.

During the Vietnam War, Viet Cong (VC) soldiers would rig rubber band grenades and place them in huts that US soldiers would likely burn. Another popular booby trap was the &quot;Grenade in a Can&quot;, a grenade with the safety pin removed in a container and a string attached, sometimes with the grenade&#x27;s fuse mechanism modified to give a much shorter delay than the four to seven seconds typical with grenade fuses. VC soldiers primarily used these on doors and attached them to tripwires on jungle paths.

The CIA and Green Berets countered by booby trapping the enemy&#x27;s ammunition supplies, in an operation code–named &quot;Project Eldest Son&quot;. The propellant in a rifle or machine–gun cartridge was replaced with high explosive. Upon being fired, the sabotaged round would destroy the gun and kill or injure the shooter. Mortar shells were similarly rigged to explode when dropped down the tube, instead of launching properly. This ammunition was then carefully re–packed to eliminate any evidence of tampering, and planted in enemy munitions dumps by covert insertion teams. A sabotaged round might also be planted in a rifle magazine or machine–gun belt and left on the body of a dead VC soldier, in anticipation that the deceased&#x27;s ammo would be picked up and used by his comrades. No more than one sabotaged round would be planted in any case, magazine, or belt of ammunition, to reduce the chances of the enemy finding it no matter how diligently they inspected their supplies. False rumors and forged documents were circulated to make it appear that the Communist Chinese were supplying the VC with defective weapons and ammunition.

====Northern Ireland====
During the Troubles, an ethnonationalist conflict in Northern Ireland, booby traps were used by Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitaries to target British security forces and civilians. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was the most prolific user of the booby traps during the conflict; according to the Sutton Index of Deaths, 180 people were killed during the Troubles as the result of booby trap bombs, the vast majority of them laid by the IRA. A common type of booby trap was the car bomb, which involved attaching a bomb to a car so that starting or driving it would detonate the explosive.

====Middle East====
Lebanese media reported on the phenomenon of intentionally concealed bombs in children&#x27;s toys in 1997, citing a number of examples. Israel occupied southern Lebanon between 1982 and 2000 and during that period planted hundreds of thousands of landmines and bomblets. A report by the UK Foreign Affairs Committee in 2000 warned of the dangers of unexploded bombs in southern Lebanon, mentioning the use of &quot;booby-trapped toys, allegedly dropped by the Israeli air force near Lebanese villages adjacent to the so-called security zone&quot;.

During the Al-Aqsa Intifada (2000—2005), some Arab–Palestinian groups made wide use of booby traps to prevent the Israeli army from entering their cities on Palestinian territories. The largest use of booby traps was in the Battle of Jenin during Operation Defensive Shield where a large number (1000–2000 bombs and booby traps according to a Palestinian militant who surrendered to Israeli forces in Jenin) of explosive devices were planted by insurgents. Booby traps had been laid in the streets of both the camp and the town, ready to be triggered if a foot snagged a tripwire or a vehicle rolled over a mine. Some of the bombs were huge, containing as much as 250 lb (110 kg) of explosives. To counter the booby traps, anti–tank and anti–personnel mines the Israeli army sent armored Caterpillar D9 bulldozers to clear the area out of any explosive device and booby trap planted. Eventually, a dozen D9 bulldozers went into action, razing the center of the refugee camp and forcing the Palestinian militants inside to surrender.

In the Israel–Hamas war, Israel&#x27;s use of pagers and walkie-talkies detonations to target the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah that killed 42 people and injured 3,500 more, was condemned by some as illegal.

==Civilian use and legal ramifications==

Booby traps have been applied as defensive weapons against non-military trespassers, but most jurisdictions consider the practice illegal.

==Practical jokes==

Instead of being used to kill, maim or injure people, booby traps can also be used for entertainment. Practical joke booby traps are typically disguised as everyday items such as cigars or packets of chewing gum, nuts or other snack items. When the victims attempts to use the item, the trap is triggered. Two of the best known examples of this are the exploding cigar and dribble glass; others include the snake nut can and shocking gum. Booby traps can also be constructed out of household or workplace items and be triggered when the victim performs a common action. Examples of this include loosening the bolts in a chair so that it collapses when sat upon, or placing a bucket of water on top of a partly open door so that when the door is fully opened, the bucket tips onto the victim.

<doc id="248237" wikidata="Q1466261" url="?curid=248237" title="Torness nuclear power station">
<text>Torness nuclear power station is a nuclear power station located approximately east of Edinburgh at Torness Point near Dunbar in East Lothian, Scotland. It was the last of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors to be fully commissioned. Construction of this facility began in 1980 for the then South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB) and it was commissioned in 1988. It is a local landmark, highly visible from the A1 trunk road and East Coast Main Line railway. 

The power station is expected to be shut down in March 2030, prior to defuelling and then decommissioning.

== History ==
After extensive discussions with the local planning authority and more than twenty other interested organisations, the South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB) sought approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland in 1973 for Torness as a site for a nuclear power station. A public exhibition was held at Dunbar in February 1974 to explain the Board&#x27;s proposals, and in June 1974, a public inquiry was held.
There was widespread public opposition to the building of a nuclear plant at Torness. Diverse campaigning groups came together to highlight the environmental and human cost of nuclear power stations. In May 1978, 4,000 people marched from Dunbar to occupy the Torness site. Many of them signed a declaration to “take all nonviolent steps necessary to prevent the construction of a nuclear power station at Torness”.

The SSEB submitted designs for four types of reactor then being considered by HM Government for the next stage of the UK civil nuclear programme: the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR), the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR), the Light Water Reactor (LWR) and the High Temperature Reactor (HTR). In February 1975, the Secretary of State for Scotland granted the SSEB statutory consent for the location of future nuclear power stations and, after review of the four alternative reactor types, consent was given on 24 May 1978 for construction of the AGR station.

The construction, which was undertaken by a consortium known as National Nuclear Corporation (&#x27;NNC&#x27;), began in 1980. The reactors were supplied by NNC, the boilers by NEI and the turbines by GEC.

The station consists of two advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR) capable of producing a peak rating of 1,364MWe. In February, 1989, Torness Unit 2 became the last Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor commissioned. On deregulation of the United Kingdom&#x27;s electricity generation market the following year, Torness passed to the state-owned Scottish Nuclear, privatised as part of British Energy which was sold to the French company Électricité de France (EDF) in January 2009, and incorporated in the latter&#x27;s UK subsidiary EDF Energy. It was expected to operate until 2030. Cracking is now expected to cause the closure of the plant in March 2028.

In December 2024, in response to concerns over energy security following delays to the opening of Hinkley Point C, EDF announced that the life of Torness would be extended two years until March 2030.

In January 2025, EDF stated that &quot;their ambition is to generate beyond these dates [of March 2030], subject to plant inspections and regulatory oversight&quot;.

== Plant design ==

Torness shares its design with Heysham 2 nuclear power station. The station was designed by NNC, a company created from the gradual amalgamation of five consortia that were formed in the 1950s and 1960s to build the UK&#x27;s commercial nuclear power stations. NNC is now part of Jacobs Engineering Group.

The graphite-moderated, gas-cooled design was proven at the WAGR – the Windscale experimental AGR facility – and is a significant evolution of the Magnox reactor designs.

When first operated Torness probably had the most sophisticated and complex computerised control system for a nuclear power station worldwide, and far more sophisticated than earlier members of the advanced gas-cooled reactor fleet. Over 70 Ferranti Argus 700 computers are used in the control and instrumentation systems, which included Digital Direct Control (DDC) of the reactors.

In 2020, the staff training simulator was replaced, partly to reflect plant upgrades and to simulate interactions between the two reactor systems and with auxiliary systems, and to provide modern simulation capabilities. The original reactor control system was unchanged.

Nuclear fuel for Torness power station can be delivered and removed via a loading/unloading facility on a branch from the adjacent East Coast Main Line.

==Incidents==

In November 1999, a Panavia Tornado F.3 of the Royal Air Force crashed into the North Sea less than 1km from the power station following an engine failure. The UK Ministry of Defence commended the two crew members for demonstrating &quot;exceptional levels of airmanship and awareness in the most adverse of conditions&quot;, because they ensured that the Tornado was clear of the power station before abandoning the aircraft.

In May 2002, a gas circulator pump failed. Forensic evidence suggested an undetected fatigue crack in part of the impeller led to failure. In August, another gas circulator on the other reactor showed increasing vibration and was shut down by the operators. When it was taken apart, there was a fully developed fatigue related crack in a similar position to the first failure, but the prompt shutdown had prevented further damage.

In August 2005, screens in the seawater cooling intake system were blocked by seaweed. This possibility had been foreseen for the plant and preprepared plans were activated, leading to both reactors being shut down.

In June 2011, both reactors were manually shut down due to reduced flow of seawater after intakes were clogged by a large mass of jellyfish.

<doc id="248239" wikidata="Q2480375" url="?curid=248239" title="Under a Pale Grey Sky">
<text>Under a Pale Grey Sky is a live album by Sepultura, released on September 24, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. The album was recorded in the Brixton Academy, London on December 16, 1996. Max Cavalera left Sepultura shortly after the concert, following an argument with his band mates outside the band&#x27;s touring bus.

The two other bands performing on that same night were Strife and Floodgate.

The album was released by Roadrunner Records after dropping Sepultura from the label. The set list for the show sees the band play the majority of that year&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot; album, as well as the most popular songs from their previous albums. The title of the album is a direct reference to the chorus of the song &quot;Arise&quot; from their fourth album of the same name.

<doc id="248240" wikidata="Q836810" url="?curid=248240" title="Duke of Cambridge">
<text>Duke of Cambridge is a hereditary title of nobility in the British royal family, one of several royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom. The title is named after the city of Cambridge in England. It is heritable by male descendants by primogeniture, and has been conferred upon various members of the British royal family several times throughout history.

The title of Duke of Cambridge, first created in 1660, superseded an earlier title of Earl of Cambridge. The title became extinct several times before being revived in 2011, when Queen Elizabeth II bestowed it on her grandson Prince William on 29 April 2011 upon his marriage to Catherine Middleton. Catherine became known as the Duchess of Cambridge.

==History==
The title was first granted in 1660 by Charles II of England (immediately following the Restoration of the monarchy) to his infant eldest nephew Charles Stuart (1660–1661), the first son of the Duke of York (later King James II), though he was never formally created Duke of Cambridge as he died at the age of six months. The first officially recognised creation of the dukedom was in the Peerage of England in 1664, when King Charles II granted the title to his next eldest surviving nephew James Stuart, the infant second son of the Duke of York, who died early in 1667 at the age of three, when the title again became extinct. The title was then granted later that year by King Charles II to his next eldest surviving nephew Edgar Stuart, the third son of the Duke of York, who also died in infancy, in 1671 at the age of three, when the title became extinct the third time. The Duke of York&#x27;s fourth son Charles (his eldest son by his second wife) was also styled Duke of Cambridge in 1677, but died when about a month old, not having lived long enough to be formally created duke.

The title was recreated by Queen Anne in 1706 who granted it to George Augustus (later King George II), son of the Elector of Hanover (later King George I), her distant cousin (both being descended from King James I). When the title was created George Augustus was third in line to the throne, after his grandmother Sophia and his father. When he ascended to the throne as King George II in 1727, the dukedom merged with the Crown.

The title was again recreated in the peerage of the United Kingdom and was granted in 1801 by King George III to his seventh son Prince Adolphus (1774–1850), then aged 27. Following his death in 1850 the title was inherited by his only son Prince George, 2nd Duke of Cambridge, whose three sons were barred from inheriting the title as his marriage had been in violation of the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Thus on the death of the 2nd Duke in 1904 the title again became extinct.

During the period leading up to the 1999 wedding of Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, some people speculated that the Dukedom of Cambridge or Sussex were the most likely to be granted to him, and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; later reported that Prince Edward was at one point set to be titled Duke of Cambridge. Instead, Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex, and it was announced that he would eventually be created the next Duke of Edinburgh after his father.

On 29 April 2011, the day of his wedding, it was announced that Queen Elizabeth II had created her grandson Prince William Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus, titles relating respectively to places in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, three of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. The letters patent granting these titles received the great seal on 26 May 2011.

<text>East Fortune is a village in East Lothian, Scotland, located 2 miles (3 km) north west of East Linton. The area is known for its airfield which was constructed in 1915 to help protect Britain from attack by German Zeppelin airships during the First World War.

The name may mean &quot;settlement where hogs are farmed&quot;, from Old English &quot;fōr&quot;, a hog, and &quot;tūn&quot;, a settlement. In 1922 several buildings and an area of land were used to create East Fortune Hospital. This served as a tuberculosis sanatorium for the south east region of Scotland until the onset of World War II, when the airfield was brought back into service as RAF East Fortune, and the hospital patients were transferred to Bangour Hospital in West Lothian. The hospital re-opened after the war, but by 1956, as the number of tuberculosis patients began to fall, the hospital changed its function to house the mentally handicapped. In 1997, the hospital closed down, and its patients were transferred to Roodlands Hospital in Haddington.

At the eastern side of the airfield the old runways and link roads of East Fortune airfield are now used as a motorcycle race track run by the Melville Motorcycle Club. There are around seven race weekends every year with racing on both Saturdays and Sundays, continually attracting over 200 competitors over the several classes available. Riders travel from the local area, Northumberland and as far as Ireland on occasions for most weekends. Melville Motorcycle Club run the track on a not-for-profit basis and have reinvested heavily in resurfacing and upgrading facilities. From 2014, the track also hosts a Greenpower race.

<doc id="248255" wikidata="Q730726" url="?curid=248255" title="Evangelical Lutheran Church in America">
<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is a mainline Protestant church headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The ELCA was officially formed on January 1, 1988, by the merging of three Lutheran church bodies. As of December 31, 2023, it has approximately 2.79 million baptized members in 8,498 congregations.

In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 1.4 percent of the U.S. population self-identifies with the ELCA. It is the seventh-largest Christian denomination by reported membership and the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States. The next two largest Lutheran denominations are the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) (with over 1.7 million baptized members) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) (with approximately 340,000 members). There are also many in the United States, some formed by dissidents to the major 1988 merger. Its members are largely descendants of Scandinavians and Germans who emigrated from countries where Lutheranism was the state religion.

The ELCA belongs to the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, and the Lutheran World Federation. It is in full communion with the Episcopal Church, Moravian Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist Church.

==History==

Various Lutheran church bodies in the United States formed resulting from immigration waves from various countries. For instance, members of the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) (centered in New York City, New York, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) were largely descendants of immigrants in the colonial and mid-19th century period. The American Lutheran Church (ALC), with headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was influenced by descendants of the waves of Scandinavian and German immigration to the Midwest in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In their countries of origin, especially in Scandinavia and northern Germany, the Lutheran churches were the state churches. As Lutherans emigrated to America, they initially saw themselves as part of these churches, though they lacked the same organization and formal status in the New World. Over time Lutherans formed church organizations in America. The Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC), which withdrew from the LCMS in 1975, comprised many congregations throughout the lower Midwest. Over time, church associations&#x27; national or ethnic identification lessened as descendants assimilated into general American society. Members across organizations began to have more in common as areas of the country urbanized and more people made their livings in suburbs and cities, rather than in rural farming areas. The ALC and LCA were already the result of earlier mergers among associated congregations once related to ethnic immigrant groups.

In 1970, a survey by Strommen et al. found that 79% of Lutheran Church in America clergy, 62% of American Lutheran Church clergy, and 58% of Lutheran Church Missouri Synod clergy agreed that &quot;a merger of all Lutheran groups in the United States into one organization is desirable&quot;. A group of congregations left the LCMS after 1975 as it became dominated by theological and social conservatives; they formed the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC).

After several years of discussion, the LCA, ALC, and AELC formally agreed in 1982 to unite. Implementing this agreement took longer: the new Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA) was effective on January 1, 1988, creating the largest Lutheran church body in the U.S. The ALC and LCA had been formed by previous mergers.

===American Lutheran Church===
In 1960, the American Lutheran Church formed as a merger of the earlier ALC of 1930, largely members of German heritage; the United Evangelical Lutheran Church (UELC), with members of Danish background; and the Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELC), made up of members of Norwegian background. The Lutheran Free Church (LFC) joined three years later in 1963.

The ALC brought approximately 2.25 million members into the new ELCA. It was the most theologically conservative of the forming bodies, having a heritage of Old Lutheran theology. It had been in fellowship for a decade with the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod and officially held to biblical inerrancy in its constitution. It seldom enforced that stance by means of heresy trials or other doctrinal discipline. Its geographic center was in the Upper Midwest, especially Minnesota. Its headquarters and publisher (Augsburg Publishing House) were based on South Fifth Street in Minneapolis and one of its several seminaries was in neighboring St. Paul. Its denominational magazine was &quot;The Lutheran Standard&quot;, published in Minneapolis. Some ALC congregations chose not to join the 1988 merger and instead formed the American Association of Lutheran Churches.

===Lutheran Church in America===

The Lutheran Church in America (LCA) was created in 1962 by a merger among the United Lutheran Church in America (created in 1918 by an earlier merger of three German Lutheran synods in the eastern U.S.); Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church, of Swedish ethnicity with some dating to the colonial era; the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America; and American Evangelical Lutheran Church, made up of ethnic Danish families.

The LCA was the slightly larger partner and brought approximately 2.85 million members into the ELCA. Its administrative offices were in the Church House, a former townhouse mansion on Madison Avenue in New York City. Its publishing house, Fortress Press, was on Queen Lane in northwest Philadelphia, and produced the church magazine, &quot;The Lutheran&quot;. Its demographic focus was on the East Coast, centered on Pennsylvania). It also had large numbers in the Midwest and some presence in the South Atlantic States. There are notable exceptions, but LCA-background churches tend to emphasize liturgical expression more than the ALC-background churches. Its theological orientation ranged from moderately liberal to neo-orthodox, with tendencies toward conservative Pietism in some rural and small-town congregations. Its theology originated in Neo-Lutheranism.

===The Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches===
In 1976, the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC) was formed by 250 congregations that had left the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) in a schism precipitated by disputes over biblical inerrancy and ecumenism. These were part of the overall fundamentalist–modernist controversy that had been roiling American Protestant churches for several decades. In 1969 the LCMS had elected more conservative leadership under President J. A. O. Preus II, replacing moderate incumbent Oliver Harms. The new leadership opened an investigation at the synod&#x27;s Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, about the faculty&#x27;s commitment to inerrancy in biblical interpretation. It also opposed ecumenism.

As a result, most of the faculty and student body walked out and established a separate institution named &quot;Concordia Seminary-in-Exile&quot; (but usually referred to as &quot;Seminex&quot;). The AELC formed in 1976. It brought approximately 100,000 members into the ELCA. Its ethnic heritage was primarily from German immigrants of the mid-19th century, who came to the U.S. after the revolutions in various principalities. Many were abolitionists and Unionists during the American Civil War. By the 1980s, the AELC theology generally resembled the LCA&#x27;s.

==Organization==

The ELCA is headed by a presiding bishop, who is elected by the Churchwide Assembly for a six-year term (it was a four-year term until 1995). To date, four people have been elected to the position of presiding bishop of the ELCA. Herbert W. Chilstrom served as the first presiding bishop from 1987 to 1995. He was followed by H. George Anderson (1995–2001), who had previously been the president of Luther College. The third presiding bishop was Mark Hanson, who is the past president of the Lutheran World Federation, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Hanson began his tenure as bishop of the Church in 2001 and was re-elected in August 2007 for a second term. Elizabeth Eaton was elected presiding bishop in August 2013 and took office on November 1, 2013. She was reelected for a second term in 2019. In November 2023, Michael Burk was appointed Presiding Bishop Pro Tempore by the ELCA Church Council following a request by Bishop Eaton to take a 4–6 month leave of absence.

In addition, the body of the Church Council is composed of representatives elected for a stated number of years from the various synods. These meet regularly with legislative powers in between sessions of the Churchwide Assemblies.

The Conference of Bishops, which meets at least twice a year, is formed of 66 bishops (the 65 elected synodical bishops, together with the presiding bishop), plus the ELCA church secretary. It is consulted by the presiding bishop and the Church Council for advice on matters of doctrine, faith and order, and ecumenical relations. The ELCA website states that &quot;While primarily advisory, the role of the Conference of Bishops is significant within the life of this church.&quot;
The ELCA is divided into 65 synods, one of which is non-geographical (the Slovak Zion Synod) and 64 regional synods in the United States and the Caribbean, each headed by a synodical bishop and council; these synods are in turn grouped into nine regions. Within the ELCA the term &quot;synod&quot; refers to the middle judicatory, which is referred to in some other denominations as &quot;presbyteries&quot;, &quot;districts&quot;, &quot;conferences&quot; or &quot;dioceses&quot; (the most ancient and traditional term in Christianity). In other Christian churches, the term &quot;synod&quot; is used for a meeting or conference of ministers such as priests or bishops of a diocese, province (region) or nation or, in some Protestant churches, as the term for their annual governing convention. Some Evangelical Lutheran denominations overseas continue to use the ancient church title of &quot;diocese&quot;.

Outside of the United States, ELCA also has congregations in the Caribbean region (Bahamas which is combined with Florida in one synod; Bermuda, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands); and one congregation in the border city of Windsor, Ontario, a member of the Slovak Zion Synod. Before 1986, some of the congregations that form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada were part of the ELCA&#x27;s predecessor churches.

Within the church structure are divisions addressing many programs and ministries. Among these are support for global mission, outdoor ministries, campus ministries, social ministries, and education. They include the Lutheran Peace Fellowship, Lutheran Women&#x27;s Caucus, Lutheran Volunteer Corps, and the Lutheran Youth Organization ELCA Youth Gathering (formerly known in predecessor denominations as the Luther League). They cooperate with an ecumenical inter-Lutheran college/university student organization known as the Lutheran Student Movement-USA founded in 1922 and reorganized in 1969. The denominational publishing house is Augsburg Fortress, and the official denominational magazine is &quot;Living Lutheran&quot;. ELCA predecessor bodies established twenty-six colleges and universities, which are now affiliated with the ELCA and a large number of associated theological seminaries. Some of these are associated with neighboring universities or theological consortia.

Most local congregations are legally independent non-profit corporations within the state where they are located and own their own property. Governing practice within the congregation ranges from congregational voters&#x27; assemblies or annual and special congregational meetings to elder-and-council-led, to congregations where the senior pastor wields great, if informal, power (more common in larger churches).

===Churchwide Assemblies===
The Churchwide Assembly consists of elected lay and ordained voting members. The Churchwide Assembly met biennially in odd-numbered years until 2013. Between meetings of the Churchwide Assembly, the ELCA Church Council governs the denomination, along with the advisory Conference of Bishops.

At the Assembly, elections are held for general officers of the Church such as the presiding bishop, vice president and secretary, budgets are adopted, social statements examined and approved, and various other church business enacted, along with reports made and ecumenical visitors acknowledged. A constitutional amendment was passed in 2011 to change the Assembly to one meeting on a triennial basis after 2013. The Assembly was known as the &quot;General Convention&quot; in the ALC and the &quot;Biennial Convention&quot; in the LCA.

==Beliefs==

===Lutheranism===
Lutheranism is associated with the theology of Martin Luther, with its official confessional writings found in the Book of Concord. The ELCA accepts the unaltered Augsburg Confession (not the variata) as a true witness to the Gospel. The ELCA is less conservative than the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States, respectively. Most ELCA Lutherans are theologically moderate-to-liberal, although there is a sizable conservative minority. Other Lutheran bodies in the U.S. tend to hold more strictly to Confessional Lutheranism.

===Differences within the ELCA===

Constituent congregations of the ELCA hold many differences of opinion, and have had disputes over social and doctrinal issues. In part, this is related to the history of having assimilated three different Lutheran church bodies, each with its own factions and divisions, but also to responses to changing social conditions in the United States. Old intra-group conflicts were inherited and new inter-group ones were created. Differences on issues usually reflect theological disputes between various parties.

The ELCA is a very broad denomination. It contains groups of socially and/or theologically conservative or liberal factions with differing emphases on various topics such as liturgical renewal, confessional Lutheranism, charismatic revivalism, moderate to liberal theology, and liberal activism. The socially liberal segment of the ELCA is represented by independent organizations such as ReconcilingWorks, Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries, and the Evangelical and Ecumenical Women&#x27;s Caucus. What is now known as the Lutheran Coalition For Renewal (Lutheran CORE) is made up ELCA congregations as well as socially conservative congregations that left the ELCA after it (the ELCA) decided to accept openly gay clergy for ordination and calling. Adherents of Evangelical Catholicism practice High Church Lutheranism and include the members of the Society of the Holy Trinity. Those oriented toward Confessional Lutheranism, Evangelicalism, or an admixture of the two include the WordAlone network. Members of the Charismatic Movement include congregations and pastors associated with the Alliance of Renewal Churches and some ethnic congregations. Additionally, there has been a recent growth in Franciscan spirituality in the ELCA through the Order of Lutheran Franciscans.

===Scripture===
The ELCA constitution states: &quot;This church accepts the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the inspired Word of God and the authoritative source and norm of its proclamation, faith, and life.&quot;

ELCA clergy tend not to subscribe to a doctrine of biblical inerrancy, but see validity in various scholarly methods of analysis to help in understanding the Bible, a process sometimes called Higher Criticism.

===Sacraments===
Like other Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA confesses two sacraments: Communion (or the Eucharist) and Holy Baptism (including infant baptism). Guidance on sacramental practices in the ELCA is provided in &quot;The Use of the Means of Grace&quot;, a statement adopted by the 1997 Churchwide Assembly.

In addition to the two sacraments, ELCA churches also practice acts which are orders. These include confirmation, ordination, anointing the sick, confession and absolution, and marriage.

With respect to the eucharist or the Lord&#x27;s Supper, the ELCA holds to the Lutheran doctrine of the sacramental union, that is, that Christ&#x27;s body and blood is truly present &quot;in, with and under&quot; the bread and wine. All communicants orally receive not only bread and wine, but also the same body and blood of Christ that was given for them on the cross. Members of other denominations sometimes refer to this as a belief in consubstantiation. Lutherans, however, reject the philosophical explanation of consubstantiation, preferring to consider the presence of the Lord&#x27;s body and blood as mysterious rather than explainable by human philosophy. The Lutheran belief in the holy mystery character of the consecrated bread and wine is more similar to that of Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief than to the views of other Protestants. In contrast, some Protestant church bodies doubt or openly deny that the true body and blood of Christ is eaten in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

Unlike certain other American Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA practices open communion, permitting all persons baptized in the name of the Trinity with water to receive communion. Some congregations also commune baptized infants, similarly to Eastern Orthodox practice. The ELCA encourages its churches to celebrate the Eucharist at all services, although some churches alternate between non-eucharistic services and those containing the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

===Social issues===
The ELCA&#x27;s stances on social issues are outlined in its Social Statements and Messages. Social Statements, which are usually, but not always, adopted by a two-thirds majority of a Churchwide Assembly, have been adopted on the following topics:

* Abortion (1991)
* Church in Society (1991)
* Death Penalty (1991)
* Economic Life (1999)
* Education (2007)
* Environment (1993)
* Genetics (2011)
* Health and Health Care (2003)
* Human Sexuality (2009)
* Peace (1995)
* Race, Ethnicity &amp; Culture (1993)
* Migrant Crisis (2019)
====Role of women====
The ELCA ordains women as pastors, a practice that all three of its predecessor churches adopted in the 1970s (The ALC and LCA in 1970, the AELC in 1976). Some women have become bishops. The first female bishop, April Ulring Larson, was elected in the La Crosse area synod in 1992. In 2018, the ELCA elected its first African-American female bishops: Patricia Davenport in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Viviane Thomas-Breitfeld in South-Central Wisconsin. In 2013, Elizabeth Eaton became the first woman to be elected presiding bishop of the ELCA. The most recent ELCA hymnal, &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot;, includes alternate gender-neutral invocations and benedictions in all settings. All of the psalms and many of the hymns and parts of the liturgy have been altered to remove masculine pronouns referring to God. In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project surveyed 681 ELCA pastors and found that 95 percent of ELCA clergy thought that all clergy positions should be open to women, while 2 percent disagreed.

====Ordination of LGBT clergy and blessings of same-sex marriages====
On August 21, 2009, the ELCA&#x27;s Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis voted to allow congregations to call and ordain gays and lesbians in committed monogamous relationships to serve as clergy. By a vote of 559 to 451, delegates approved a resolution declaring that the church would find a way for people in &quot;publicly accountable, lifelong, monogamous same-gender relationships&quot; to serve as official ministers. Congregations that do not wish to call these persons to ordained ministry are not required by these policy changes to do so.

In reaction, Lutheran CORE, which opposed the decision, stated that it would &quot;initiate a process that we hope will lead to a reconfiguration of North American Lutheranism.&quot; In February 2010, Lutheran CORE announced that it would secede from the ELCA and form a new denomination to be named the North American Lutheran Church (NALC). , 37 percent of ELCA pastors were found to support same-sex marriage.

The ELCA, in removing sexual orientation as a bar for candidacy in the professional ministry, joined most of its Lutheran sister churches in Europe, including in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and Austria. The ELCA is also among a growing number of Christian churches in the United States to make this move, which include the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the United Methodist Church. 

In contrast, the board of one of the ELCA&#x27;s partner churches, the Evangelical Mekane Yesus Fellowship in North America, voted in October 2009 to declare disunity with the ELCA. A press release stated that the board was no longer &quot;in good conscience&quot; &quot;able to commune and partner with ELCA Church that has willfully disobeyed the word of God and regrettably departed from the clear instructions of the Holy Scriptures&quot; that &quot;marriage is only between a man and a woman&quot;. This was followed by the general synod of the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus also breaking links with the ELCA.

In April 2010, the Church Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America adopted revisions to ministry policy documents to bring them in line with the August 2009 vote, as well as adding sections on integrity, substance abuse and addiction. The release noted that the revised ministry policies would be posted on the church&#x27;s website by the end of April 2010.

Since August 2009, according to the office of the ELCA secretary, over 600 congregations have left the ELCA through January 2011. Income declined, with revenue of $66.7 million in 2010, down from $76.5 million in 2009.

On May 31, 2013, Guy Erwin became the first openly gay man to be chosen bishop in the ELCA when he was elected to a six-year term as bishop of the Southwest California Synod. In 2015, the denomination ordained, officially, the first transgender pastor.

Also in 2015, after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationally in the US, the office of the presiding bishop released a letter informing members that each congregation is free to marry gay and lesbian couples or to choose not to do so.

Since 2009 blessings of same-sex marriages are allowed in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

====Creation and evolution====
The ELCA has not adopted an official position on creation or evolution, but there is general agreement on interpreting the Bible within its historical contexts and applying critical methods of research. In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project surveyed 681 ELCA pastors and found that 26 percent of ELCA clergy thought Scientific Creationism should be taught alongside evolution in biology classes, while 57 percent disagreed.

====Reproductive cloning====
The ELCA has not yet taken an official position regarding reproductive cloning. However, Task Force on Genetics of the church&#x27;s &quot;Church in Society&quot; initiative is studying the theological and ethical issues that the world is likely to face in coming years as a result of Genetic Science. The task force has issued a draft report for comment and discussion. The draft statement covers a wide range of topics, from genetic testing to GMOs. A section in this report which has been described by an independent reviewer as &quot;a remarkably nuanced analysis and statement regarding a very complex scientific, social, and religious issue.&quot; The task force recommends opposition to reproductive cloning, as almost all religious groups currently do. However, the main theological reasoning is unique. Lewis D. Eigen explains:
The argument they articulate is not the common but weak argument that it would be &quot;offensive to God,&quot; &quot;against the will of God&quot; or &quot;man encroaching into God&#x27;s domain&quot;, but they observe that the clone would be denied the dignity of possessing a unique human genotype. This is an extremely interesting argument—that each and every human being has the right to his or her own uniqueness—particularly a unique genotype.

The draft statement further asserts that any clones that might be created should have full acceptance as human beings and access to rites of the church.

====Abortion====
The issue of abortion is a matter of contention within the ELCA. In a Social Statement adopted in 1991, the church set out its position on the matter as follows. The ELCA describes itself as &quot;a community supportive of life&quot;, and encourages women to explore alternatives to abortion such as adoption. However, the Social Statement asserts that there are certain circumstances under which a decision to end a pregnancy can be &quot;morally responsible&quot;. These include cases where the pregnancy &quot;presents a clear threat to the physical life of the woman&quot;, situations where &quot;the pregnancy occurs when both parties do not participate willingly in sexual intercourse&quot;, and &quot;circumstances of extreme fetal abnormality, which will result in severe suffering and very early death of an infant.&quot; Regardless of the reason, the ELCA opposes abortion when &quot;a fetus is developed enough to live outside a uterus with the aid of reasonable and necessary technology.&quot; The ELCA opposes &quot;laws that deny access to safe and affordable services for morally justifiable abortions&quot;, and &quot;laws that are primarily intended to harass those contemplating or deciding for an abortion.&quot; The statement emphasizes the prevention of circumstances leading to abortion, specifically encouraging &quot;appropriate forms of sex education in schools, community pregnancy prevention programs, and parenting preparation classes.&quot; In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project found that one fifth of ELCA clergy favored banning abortion with a constitutional amendment. Lutheran CORE, which represents theologically conservative members of ELCA, together with the North American Lutheran Church, through their Joint Commission an Theology and Doctrine, approved an official anti-abortion stance in the document &quot;The Lord Is with You&quot; – A Word of Counsel to the Church – The Sanctity of Nascent Life&quot;, on December 14, 2012.

====Euthanasia====
The ELCA official statement on &quot;End of Life Decisions&quot;, adopted on November 9, 1992, disapproves euthanasia: &quot;We oppose the legalization of physician-assisted death, which would allow the private killing of one person by another. Public control and regulation of such actions would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. The potential for abuse, especially of people who are most vulnerable, would be substantially increased.&quot;

==Ministry==

As a Lutheran church body, the ELCA professes belief in the &quot;priesthood of all believers&quot; as reflected in Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot;, that all baptized persons have equal access to God and are all called to use their gifts to serve the body of Christ. Some people are called to &quot;rostered ministry&quot;, or vocations of church leadership and service. After formation, theological training, and approval by local synods these people are &quot;set aside, but not above&quot; through ordination.

An extensive &quot;Study of Ministry&quot; was embarked upon immediately after the 1988 merger as it became apparent that there were still discordant viewpoints and influences, especially by the pressure for a renewal of the office of deacon and its different manifestations to a more ancient and traditional view predating the Reformation into the earliest days of Christianity. The church makes a clear distinction between the deacon&#x27;s &quot;Ministry of Word and Service&quot;, and the Pastor&#x27;s &quot;Ministry of Word and Sacrament&quot;.

In the ELCA, ordination refers to the setting apart of pastors in the ministry of word and sacrament and deacons in the ministry of word and service (before 2019, consecration was the term for setting apart deacons). The similar rite for setting apart a bishop is called installation. These rites (for bishops, pastors, and deacons) are formal liturgies, with prayer and the laying-on of hands by the bishop, or by the presiding bishop in the case of the installation of a new bishop. Since 2000, the ELCA has required all installations of new bishops to include the laying-on of hands by not fewer than three bishops who are known to be within the historic line of apostolic succession.

===Deacons===
Deacons are called to a &quot;Ministry of Word and Service&quot;. The former lay rosters of deaconess, diaconal minister, and associate in ministry were all merged onto one roster, called Deacons, beginning in January 2017.

Deacons serve in many roles in and beyond congregations. At their ordination they may be presented with a towel and basin (in reference to Jesus washing the feet of his disciples) as a sign of their servant ministry, but the rite of ordination (published in January 2017) also allows for other symbols to be presented, reflecting the broad range of diaconal service. The rite states: &quot;Other symbols of the ministry of word and service may be given, which may reflect a particular focus of the deacon&#x27;s call and vocation, such as a vessel containing oil, a Bible, or the book of worship.&quot;

===Pastors===
Pastors are called to the &quot;Ministry of Word and Sacrament&quot; and considered a &quot;steward of the mysteries&quot; of the Church (the means of grace). Pastors primarily serve congregations, but some serve in specialized ministries including those of hospital chaplain and military chaplain.

Pastors are ordinarily trained at one of seven ELCA seminaries located throughout the United States, although there are alternative paths for ordination to serve particular communities in which it is difficult to provide trained ministers or to allow rostering of clergy transferred from other denominations. Pastors generally hold a Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent, as well as a four-year master of divinity degree. They are required to learn biblical Hebrew and Greek, and spend at least a summer doing clinical pastoral education—an intensive program that gives them time to reflect on their pastoral craft, usually in a hospital setting. They are required to complete a one-year internship of full-time service in pastoral ministry.

===Bishops===
A bishop is a pastor called to serve (usually for a six-year term, which may be renewed) as the overseeing minister of a synod, or called to serve as the presiding bishop of the ELCA.

The Called to Common Mission agreement with the Episcopal Church in 2000 means that bishops are now installed according to Apostolic Succession. The fixed term of service as head of a synod has not changed, and there was no requirement in 2000 for existing ELCA bishops to be re-installed within the historic episcopate; instead, the apostolic succession was received as a sign of historic continuity, without denying the traditional Lutheran belief that the Church is truly present where the sacraments of baptism and holy communion are administered, regardless of the historic nature (or otherwise) of the ministry. Before 2000 a pastor had served in the office of bishop and then returned to being known simply as a pastor when service as a bishop had ended. Following the 2000 agreement a former bishop may still return to the work of a local pastor, but is often referred as bishop emeritus, even if not exercising that ministry.

==Worship==
Published in 2006, &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot; is the main hymnal used in congregations. Some congregations, however, continue to use the older &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot; published by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in 1978, and some even continue to use the older &quot;Service Book and Hymnal&quot; (SBH) of 1958 or its antecedent precedent-setting &quot;Common Service&quot; of 1888 which laid out a traditional American Lutheran liturgy and later was included in subsequent worship books and hymnals of various churches especially &quot;The Common Service Book&quot; of 1917, adopted by the old United Lutheran Church in America, a predecessor of the LCA to 1962, and &quot;The Lutheran Hymnal&quot; (TLH-1941) of the LCMS. Many congregations also make use of supplementary resources recently published as well besides those authorized for the &quot;LBW&quot; by Augsburg-Fortress, Publishers. Many ELCA congregations are classically liturgical churches. Their liturgy is rooted in the Western liturgical tradition, though recent international Lutheran-Orthodox dialog sessions have had some minimal influence on Lutheran liturgy. Because of its use of the Book of Concord of 1580, with the Confessions, documents and beliefs of the Reformers, including the Augsburg Confession of 1530, Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism of 1529 and the Large Catechism and its retention of many pre-Reformation traditions, such as vestments, feast days and the celebration of the Church Year, the sign of the cross, and the usage of a church-wide liturgy, there are many aspects of the typical ELCA church that are very catholic and traditional in nature. Many Evangelical Lutheran churches use traditional vestments (cassock, surplice, stole for services of the Word or non-Eucharistic liturgies or alb, cincture, stole, chasuble (pastor) or dalmatic (deacon), cope (processions) for Eucharists (Mass, Holy Communion), etc.). On special rare occasions even a bishop&#x27;s cross/crozier and mitre (bishop&#x27;s headpiece) have been used to designate the ancient robes and traditions of the Church originating in Roman times of which Luther and his fellow Reformers like Philip Melanchthon considered as &quot;adiaphora&quot; or of permissive use. Since the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, most major parts of the ELCA&#x27;s popular liturgies are worded exactly like the English language Mass of 1970 of the Roman Catholic Church. Many ELCA congregations use informal styles of worship or a blend of traditional and contemporary liturgical forms.

Springing from its revered heritage in the Lutheran chorale, the musical life of ELCA congregations is just as diverse as its worship. Johann Sebastian Bach, the most famous Lutheran composer and African songs are part of the heritage and breadth of Evangelical Lutheran church music. The musical portion of the Lutheran liturgy includes metrical psalter, metrical responses and hymns. &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot; has ten settings of Holy Communion, for example. They range from plainsong chant, to Gospel, to Latin-style music. Congregations worship in many languages, many of which are represented in &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot;. Other books used in ELCA churches include the &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot; (1978), and its supplements: &quot;With One Voice&quot;, &quot;This Far by Faith&quot;, and for Latino/Hispanic congregations: &quot;Libro de Liturgia y Cántico&quot;.

==Ecumenical relations==
The ELCA is a member of the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, and Christian Churches Together and is a &quot;partner in mission and dialog&quot; with the Churches Uniting in Christ (formerly the Consultation on Church Union) formed in 1960.

===Full communion===
The Church maintains full communion relationships with other member churches of the Lutheran World Federation (which is a communion of 140 autonomous national/regional Lutheran church bodies in 78 countries around the world, representing nearly 66 million Christians) which was reorganized in 1948 from the earlier Lutheran World Convention of 1923. The ELCA has additionally full communion with the Episcopal Church, in which several congregations are jointly affiliated and hold mixed services. Also the ELCA has since established official full communion relationships with other Christian denominations such as the Moravian Church in America (with the exception of the Alaska Province), the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, and The United Methodist Church.

In 2013, the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus severed ties, including communion and pulpit fellowship, with the ELCA over the issue of practices and teachings connected with homosexuality.

===Roman Catholic Church===
On October 31, 1999, in Augsburg, Germany, the Lutheran World Federation – of which the ELCA is a member – signed the &quot;Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification&quot; with the Roman Catholic Church. The statement is an attempt to reconcile a historical theological divide between the two communions. The &quot;Declaration&quot; also states that the mutual condemnations between 16th century Lutherans and the Roman Catholic Church no longer apply to those that have signed onto the document. This was part of a series of &quot;Lutheran-Roman Catholic Dialogues&quot; have been taking place on an official basis every few years with statements and booklets on various theological topics published since 1966.

===Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod===

The differences between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) arise from theological, historical, and cultural factors. The LCMS was briefly in fellowship with the former The American Lutheran Church, one of the ELCA predecessor bodies from 1969 to the early 1980s. Although the denominations cooperate through Lutheran World Relief and some university/college student ministries and military chaplaincy, they are not officially in communion with each other.

When the first Lutheran immigrants came to North America, they started church bodies that reflected, to some degree, the churches they left behind in Europe. Many maintained until the early 20th century their immigrant languages. They sought pastors from the &quot;old country&quot; until patterns for the education of clergy could be developed in North America. Eventually, seminaries and church colleges were established in many places to prepare pastors to serve congregations.

The earliest predecessor synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was constituted on August 25, 1748, in Philadelphia under the influence of Henry Muhlenberg, known as the &quot;Patriarch of American Lutheranism&quot;. It was known as the Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States. The earliest nationwide &quot;synod&quot; or &quot;union of synods&quot; was established in 1820 as the General Synod, followed later by the General Council. The ELCA was created in 1988 by the merging of the 2.85-million-member Lutheran Church in America (1962), 2.25-million-member The American Lutheran Church (1960), and the 100,000-member Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (1978). Previously, the ALC and LCA in the early 1960s came into being as a result of two mergers of eight smaller ethnically based Lutheran bodies composed of German, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Slovak, Dutch, and others organized over 150 years. Some of these smaller ethnically based bodies previously had ecumenical arrangements involving the Missouri Synod.

The LCMS was established in 1847 by German immigrants fleeing the forced Prussian Union between Lutherans and Reformed church members in European Germany, who later settled in Perry County, Missouri. It grew through immigration, offspring, and church mergers while participating in some, but not all of the dialogues, controversies, and compromises which affected the various predecessors of the ELCA during the 19th and 20th Centuries. In the mid-1970s the Seminex controversy at their Concordia Seminary in St. Louis over use of historical-critical biblical study led to the formation of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, later one of the predecessor bodies of the ELCA. The LCMS is the second largest Lutheran church body in North America with 1.8 million baptized members.

The ELCA tends to be more involved in ecumenical endeavors than the LCMS, which prohibits its clergy from worshiping in ecumenical gatherings. The ELCA is a member of the Lutheran World Federation, World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches of Christ, USA. The LCMS rejects these as being unionist.

Both the LCMS and the ELCA have policies relating to clergy sexual misconduct. Perry C. Francis, a former ELCA pastor turned professor, along with psychology professor Tracy D. Baldo, published the results of their 1994 study of clergy sexual misconduct in the journal &quot;Pastoral Psychology&quot;. Out of 270 ELCA and 117 LCMS clergy surveyed, 13.7 percent of ELCA clergy and 4.3 percent of LCMS clergy admitted to sexual misconduct with another person since they began their ministry.

Comparison to LCMS in ELCA&#x27;s point of view according to the 1999 book &quot;Honoring Our Neighbor&#x27;s Faith&quot; These conclusions are not agreed upon by the WELS or LCMS.

==Demographics==
=== Members ===
The table below presents demographic data for two different years of the Pew Research Center U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, 2007 and 2014. It is divided into several demographic categories like age, gender, marital status, etc. The categories have percentages out of 100 for 2007 and 2014, along with a column indicating the percent change (±).

===Beliefs, practices, and views===
The following table compares beliefs, practices, or views of members of ELCA across two years, 2007 and 2014.
Each row represents a specific belief, practice, or view.
Columns show the percentages for each year and the change between them. Each entry is broken down into different responses. For example, in the &quot;Do you believe in God or a universal spirit?&quot; row, responses are categorized as &quot;Yes, absolutely certain&quot;, &quot;Yes, fairly certain&quot;, etc.
The percentage of respondents who chose each response for each year is displayed, along with the change in percent from 2007 to 2014.

==Statistics==

Over 500,000 people have left the ELCA since the church&#x27;s human sexuality decision in 2009. Approximately 700 congregations have voted to withdraw from the ELCA, representing about 7 percent of its 2009 congregational membership. As of December 31, 2023, the ELCA has a baptized membership of 2,793,899 people. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 1.4 percent of the U.S. population, or roughly 4.4 million adherents, identify with the ELCA, which is moderately more than rostered membership suggests. Another 0.7 percent, or 2.2 million adherents, identify with mainline Lutheranism in general. A number of members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America are former Roman Catholics. As of December 31, 2023, the ELCA has 8,498 congregations.

<doc id="248256" wikidata="Q1423147" url="?curid=248256" title="Principle of double effect">
<text>The principle of double effect – also known as the rule of double effect, the doctrine of double effect, often abbreviated as DDE or PDE, double-effect reasoning, or simply double effect – is a set of ethical criteria which Christian philosophers have advocated for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one&#x27;s otherwise legitimate act may also cause an effect one would otherwise be obliged to avoid. The first known example of double-effect reasoning is Thomas Aquinas&#x27; treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;.

This set of criteria states that, if an action has foreseeable harmful effects that are practically inseparable from the good effect, it is justifiable if the following are true:
* the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;
* the agent intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect, either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;
* the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.

==Intentional harm vis-à-vis side effects==

The principle of double effect is based on the idea that there is a morally relevant difference between an &quot;intended&quot; consequence of an act and one that is foreseen by the actor but not calculated to achieve their motive. This distinction becomes clear when comparing different types of military actions, such as those of a tactical bomber versus a terror bomber. A tactical bomber engages in strikes on enemy military targets, knowing that some civilian casualties are a foreseen but unintended consequence. However, their intention is the military objective. In contrast, a terror bomber deliberately targets civilians to induce fear and achieve political objectives, making the harm to civilians the means to an end. While civilian casualties occur in both cases, the tactical bomber’s intention is not to cause harm, and the action itself is aimed at a legitimate military goal. Because advocates of double effect propose that consequentially similar acts can be morally different, double effect is most often criticized by consequentialists who consider the consequences of actions entirely determinative of the action&#x27;s morality.

In their use of the distinction between intent and foresight without intent, advocates of double effect make three arguments. First, that intent differs from foresight, even in cases in which one foresees an effect as inevitable. Second, that one can apply the distinction to specific sets of cases found in military ethics (terror bombing/strategic bombing), medical ethics (craniotomy/hysterectomy), and social ethics (euthanasia). Third, that the distinction has moral relevance, importance, or significance.

A common application of the principle is in the use of opioids to treat pain, but which also hasten someone’s death, when treating imminently terminal patients.

The doctrine consists of four conditions that must be satisfied before an act is morally permissible:

# The &quot;nature-of-the-act condition.&quot; The action itself must be morally good or, at the very least, morally neutral.
# The &quot;right-intention condition.&quot; The intention must be the achieving of only the good effect, with the bad effect being only an unintended side effect. All reasonable measures to avoid or mitigate the bad effect must be taken.
# The &quot;concurrence condition.&quot; The good effect must be caused by the action at least as immediately (in terms of causality, not—necessarily—temporally) as the bad effect. It is impermissible to attempt to bring about an indirect good with a direct evil.
#::&quot;Also formulated as:&quot;
#:* The &quot;means-end condition.&quot; The bad effect must not be the means by which one achieves the good effect. Good ends do not justify evil means.
# The &quot;proportionality condition.&quot; There must be a proportionately grave reason for permitting the evil effect.

==Criticisms==
While some consequentialists may reject the Principle, Alison McIntyre states that &quot;many criticisms of the principle of double effect do not proceed from consequentialist assumptions&quot;.

Alyson Hoyt argues that the DDE should not be used in wartime due to its potential for misuse and the complexity of modern warfare. She claims while the DDE aims to justify actions with unintended harmful consequences, it can be easily manipulated to rationalize civilian casualties as mere &quot;side effects&quot; of military objectives.

<doc id="248261" wikidata="Q2025121" url="?curid=248261" title="Kazuo Miyagawa">
<text>was a Japanese cinematographer.

==Career==
Born in Kyoto, Miyagawa was taken with sumi-e Chinese ink painting from the age of eleven and began to sell his work as an illustrator while a teenager. He became interested in the cinema during the 1920s, particularly admiring the German Expressionist silents. He joined the Nikkatsu film company in 1926 after graduating from Kyoto Commercial School. He began as a laboratory technician before becoming an assistant cameraman. Miyagawa cited the cinematography of Eiji Tsuburaya, and Kenzo Sakai as an influence on his career.

Miyagawa is best known for his tracking shots, particularly those in &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), the first of his collaborations with filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. Other films with Kurosawa include &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961) and initial preparations for &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980). He also worked on multiple films directed by Kenji Mizoguchi, including &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953). Still, only on a single Yasujirō Ozu production, &quot;Floating Weeds&quot; (1959). He oversaw 164 cameramen for Kon Ichikawa&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot; (1965), a documentary which necessitated the development of new exposure meters and viewfinders. Earlier, he had worked with Ichikawa on the drama films, &quot;Enjō&quot; (&quot;The Temple of the Golden Pavilion&quot;, 1958), &quot;Odd Obsession&quot; (aka, &quot;The Key&quot;, 1959) and &quot;The Broken Commandment&quot; (1962).

Miyagawa worked with Masahiro Shinoda in the 1980s, and at the end of his life was supervising the director&#x27;s &quot;Owls&#x27; Castle&quot; (&quot;Fukuro no Shiro&quot;/&quot;Castle of Owls&quot;, 1999).

Miyagawa is considered the inventor of the cinematographic technique known as bleach bypass, for Ichikawa&#x27;s film &quot;Her Brother&quot; (1960).

<text>The music of Canada reflects the diverse influences that have shaped the country. Indigenous Peoples, the Irish, British, and the French have all made unique contributions to the musical heritage of Canada. The music has also subsequently been influenced by American culture because of the proximity between the two countries. Since French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1605 and established the first permanent French settlements at Port Royal and Québec in 1608, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles.

Canadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes. Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music. The Canadian music industry is the sixth-largest in the world, producing internationally renowned composers, musicians and ensembles. Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC. The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada&#x27;s music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which were first awarded in 1970. The Canadian Music Hall of Fame, established in 1976, honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.

Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding Canadian Confederation by over 50 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, &quot;The Bold Canadian&quot;, was written in 1812. The national anthem, &quot;O Canada&quot;, was originally commissioned by the lieutenant governor of Quebec, Théodore Robitaille, for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony and was officially adopted in 1980. Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.

==History==
===Indigenous music===

For thousands of years, Canada has been inhabited by indigenous peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings. Each of the Indigenous communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting is widely popular, with many of its performers also using a variety of musical instruments. They used the materials at hand to make their instruments for thousands of years before Europeans immigrated to the new world. They made gourds and animal horns into rattles which were elaborately carved and painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birchbark along with drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs and dances.

For many years after European settlement, First Nations and Inuit peoples were discouraged from practicing their traditional ceremonies. However, impacts varied significantly depending on such aspects as the time period, relative population size, relation quality, resistance, etc. In 1606–1607 Marc Lescarbot collected the earliest extant transcriptions of songs from the Americas: three songs of Henri Membertou, the &quot;sakmow&quot; (Grand Chief) of the Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nations tribe situated near Port Royal, present-day Nova Scotia.

===17th century===
French settlers and explorers to New France brought with them a great love of song, dance and fiddle playing. Beginning in the 1630s French and Indigenous children at Québec were taught to sing and play European instruments, like viols, violins, guitars, transverse flutes, drums, fifes and trumpets. Ecole des Ursulines and The Ursuline Convent are among North America&#x27;s oldest schools and the first institutions of learning for women in North America. Both were founded in 1639 by French nun Marie of the Incarnation (1599–1672) alongside the laywoman Marie-Madeline de Chauvigny de la Peltrie (1603–1671) and are the first Canadian institutions to have music as part of the curriculum.

The earliest written record of violins in Canada comes from the Jesuit Relation of 1645. The Jesuits additionally have the first documented organ sale, imported for their Québec chapel in 1657. Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral, built in 1647, is the primatial church of Canada and seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec. It is the oldest Catholic &quot;Episcopal see&quot; in the New World north of Mexico and site of the first documented choir in Canada.

In what was then known as New France, the first formal ball was given by Louis-Théandre Chartier de Lotbinière (1612–1688) on 4 February 1667. Louis Jolliet (1645–1700) is on record as one of the first classically trained practicing musicians in New France, although history has recognized him more as an explorer, hydrographer and voyageur. Jolliet is said to have played the organ, harpsichord, flute, and trumpet. In 1700, under British rule at this time, an organ was installed in Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal and military bands gave concerts on the Champ de Mars. A French-born priest, René Ménard, composed motets around 1640, and a second Canadian-born priest, Charles-Amador Martin, is credited with the plainchant music for the &quot;Sacrae familiae felix spectaculum&quot;, in celebration of the Holy Family feast day in 1700.
===18th century===

Historically, music was composed in Canada&#x27;s colonies and settlements during the 18th century, although very few popular named works have survived or were even published. The French and Indian Wars began and left the population economically drained and ill-equipped to develop cultural pursuits properly. The part-time composers of this period were nonetheless often quite skilled. Traditional songs and dances, such as those of the Habitants and Métis, were transmitted orally, from generation to generation and from village to village, thus people felt no need to transcribe or publish them. Printed music was required, for music teachers and their pupils, who were from the privileged minority where domestic music making was considered a proof of gentility. Music publishing and printing in Europe by this time was a thriving industry, but it did not begin in Canada until the 19th century. Canadian composers were not able to focus entirely on creating new music in these years, as most made their living in other musical activities such as leading choirs, church organists and teaching. Regimental bands were musically a part of civil life and typically featured a dozen woodwind and brass instruments, performing at parades, festive ceremonies, minuets, country dances and balls.

After the 1760s, regular concerts became a part of the cultural landscape, as well as a wide variety of dancing. Operatic excerpts began to appear, and before the end of the century Canada had its first home-grown opera. A &quot;Concert Hall&quot; existed in Québec by 1764 and subscription concerts by 1770, given, one may presume, by band players and skilled amateurs. Programs for the Québec and Halifax concerts of the 1790s reveal orchestral and chamber music by Handel, J.C. Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Pleyel. Canada&#x27;s first two operas were written, ca. 1790 and ca. 1808 by composer, poet, and playwright Joseph Quesnel (1746–1809). The instrument of favour for the &quot;lower class&quot; was the fiddle. Fiddlers were a fixture in most public drinking establishments. God Save the King/Queen has been sung in Canada since British rule and by the mid-20th century was, along with &quot;O Canada&quot;, one of the country&#x27;s two &quot;de facto&quot; national anthems.

===19th century===

The beginning of the 19th century Canadian musical ensembles had started forming in great numbers, writing waltzes, quadrilles, polkas and galops. The first volumes of music printed in Canada was the &quot;Graduel romain&quot; in 1800 followed by the &quot;Union Harmony&quot; in 1801. Folk music was still thriving, as recounted in the poem titled &quot;A Canadian Boat Song&quot;. The poem was composed by the Irish poet Thomas Moore (1779–1852) during a visit to Canada in 1804. &quot;The Canadian Boat Song&quot; was so popular that it was published several times over the next forty years in Boston, New York City and Philadelphia. Dancing likewise was an extremely popular form of entertainment as noted In 1807 by the Scottish traveler and artist George Heriot (1759–1839), who wrote:


Among the earliest musical societies were Halifax&#x27;s &quot;New Union Singing Society&quot; of 1809 and Québec&#x27;s &quot;Harmonic Society&quot; of 1820. One of the first registered all-civilian musical ensembles was a religious sect organized from Upper Canada called the Children of Peace in 1820. In 1833, a student orchestra was organized at the Séminaire de Québec &quot;the Société Ste-Cécile&quot;, as it was known, and was one of the earliest ensembles of its kind in Lower Canada. The first appearance of a piece of music in a newspaper or magazine was in the pages of the Montreal twice-weekly newspaper, La Minerve, on September 19, 1831. Many immigrants during this time lived in relative isolation and music sometimes obtained through subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, provided entertainment and a life line to civilization. One of the earliest surviving publications in Canada of a song on the piano in sheet music format is &quot;The Merry Bells of England&quot; by J. F. Lehmann, of Bytown (later Ottawa) in 1840. It was published by John Lovell in the literary magazine &quot;Literary Garland&quot;.

The Great Migration of Canada from 1815 to 1850, consisting largely of Irish, and British immigrants, broadened considerably the Canadian musical culture. 1844, Samuel Nordheimer (1824–1912) opened a music store in Toronto selling pianos and soon thereafter began to publish engraved sheet music. Samuel Nordheimers store was among the first and the largest specialized music publisher in the Province of Canada. They initially had the sole right to publish copies of Alexander Muir&#x27;s &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; that for many years served as an unofficial Canadian national anthem.

By the time of Canadian Confederation (1867), songwriting had become a favored means of personal expression across the land. In a society in which most middle-class families now owned a harmonium or piano, and standard education included at least the rudiments of music, the result was often an original song. Such stirrings frequently occurred in response to noteworthy events, and few local or national excitements were allowed to pass without some musical comment.

The 1870s saw several conservatories open their doors, providing their string, woodwind and brass faculty, leading to the opportunity for any class level of society to learn music. &quot;One Sweetly Solemn Thought&quot; in 1876 by Hamilton-based Robert S. Ambrose, became one of the most popular songs to ever be published in the 19th century. It fulfilled the purpose of being an appropriate song to sing in the parlors of homes that would not permit any non-sacred music to be performed on Sundays. At the same time it could be sung in dance halls or on the stage along with selections from operas and operettas.

&quot;O Canada&quot; was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore Robitaille (1834–1897), for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony. Calixa Lavallée (1842–1891) wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier (1839–1920). The text was originally only in French, before it was translated into English from 1906 on.

&quot;Leo, the Royal Cadet&quot; a light opera with music by Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and a libretto by George Frederick Cameron was composed in Kingston, Ontario, in 1889. The work centres on Nellie&#x27;s love for Leo, a cadet at the Royal Military College of Canada who becomes a hero serving during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. The operetta focussed on typical character types, events and concerns of Telgmann and Cameron&#x27;s time and place.

===20th century===
==== 1900–1929 ====

Prior to the development of the gramophone, Canadian songwriters&#x27; works were published as sheet music, or in periodicals in local newspapers such as The Montreal Gazette and Toronto Empire. Most recordings purchased by Canadians in the early days of the gramophone were made by American and British performers, behind some of these international hits were Canadian songwriters. Robert Nathaniel Dett (1882–1943) was among the first Black Canadian composers during the early years of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. His works often appeared among the programs of William Marion Cook&#x27;s New York syncopated Orchestra. Dett himself performed at Carnegie Hall and at the Boston Symphony Hall as a pianist and choir director. Following quickly on the gramophone&#x27;s spread came Canada&#x27;s involvement in the First World War. The war was the catalyst for the writing and recording of large numbers of Canadian-written popular songs, some of which achieved lasting international commercial success. The military during World War I produced official music such as regimental marches and songs as well as utilitarian bugle calls. The soldiers had a repertoire of their own, largely consisting of new, often ribald, lyrics to older tunes.
Canada&#x27;s first independent record label Compo Company built a pressing plant (the largest of its day) in 1918 at Lachine, Quebec. Compo was originally created to serve the several American independent record companies such as Okeh Records which wanted to distribute records in Canada. The 1920s saw Canada&#x27;s first radio stations, this allowed Canadian songwriters to contribute some of the most famous popular music of the early 20th century. Canada&#x27;s first commercial radio station CFCF (formerly XWA) begins broadcasting regularly scheduled programming in Montreal in 1920, followed by CKAC, Canada&#x27;s first French language radio station, in 1922. By 1923, there were 34 radio stations in Canada and subsequently proliferated at a remarkable rate, and with them spread the popularity of jazz. Jazz became associated with all things modern, sophisticated, and also decadent.

In 1925, &quot;the Canadian Performing Rights Society&quot; was formed to administer public performance and royalties for composers and lyricists. It became known as the Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada (CAPAC). Toronto-born Murray Adaskin (1906–2002) was a violinist, composer, conductor and teacher at the University of Saskatchewan. From 1923 to 1936 he was an orchestral and chamber musician with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, he was later named head of music at the University of Saskatchewan. He was a composer-in-residence at the University of Saskatchewan, the first appointment of this type in Canada.

The RCA Victor factory located in Montreal, Quebec housed Canada&#x27;s first recording studio featuring polycylindrical walls which allowed the sounds to reflect in all directions. Studio Victor had artists from across Canada come in and record in both English and French, as well as had many different genres be recorded within their walls such as jazz, chamber music, choirs, classical music, folk and country. The factory is now home to many businesses one being the Musée des ondes Emile Berliner, a museum focused on the work of Berliner, mostly gramophones, flat disks, and later radios when his company merged with RCA, as well as the nature and science of sound waves.

====1930–1959====

During the Great Depression in Canada, the majority of people listened to what today would be called swing (Jazz) just as country was starting its roots. The diversity in the evolution of swing dancing in Canada is reflected in its many American names, Jive, Jitterbug and Lindy. Canada&#x27;s first big band star was Guy Lombardo (1902–1977), who formed his easy listening band, The Royal Canadians, with his brothers and friends. They achieved international success starting in the mid-1920s selling an estimated 250 million phonograph records, and were the first Canadians to have a #1 single on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s top 100. In 1932, the first Broadcasting Act was passed by Parliament creating the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. It was to both regulate all broadcasting and create a new national public radio network. 1936, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation came into existence, at the time, a million Canadian households had a radio.

Emerging from the Great Depression on near equal-footing to American popular music, Canadian popular music continued to enjoy considerable success at home and abroad in the following years. Among them Montreal&#x27;s jazz virtuoso Oscar Peterson (1925–2007), considered to have been one of the greatest pianists of all time, releasing over 200 recordings and receiving several Grammy Awards during his lifetime. Also notable is Hank Snow (1914–1999), who signed with RCA Victor in 1936 and went on to become one of America&#x27;s biggest and most innovative country music superstars of the 1940s and 1950s. Snow became a regular performer at the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville and released more than 45 LPs over his lifetime. Snow was one of the inaugural inductees to the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame started in 2003.

Canada during the Second World War produced some patriotic songs, but they were not hits in the music industry sense. A number of Canadian singers who learned their craft in Canadian opera companies in the 1930s went on to sing in major international opera houses. Most notable from the 1940s is contralto singer Portia White (1911–1968). She achieved international fame because of her voice and stage presence. As a Canadian female of African descent, her popularity helped to open previously closed doors for talented women who followed. She has been declared &quot;A person of national historic significance&quot; by the Government of Canada. In 1964 she performed for Queen Elizabeth II, at the opening of the Confederation Centre of the Arts.

Following World War II a growth phase for Canadian bands was experienced, this time among school bands. Rapid advances in the inclusion of instrumental music study in formal school curricula brought about fundamental changes to the philosophy of the band movement and the type of repertoire available. The CHUM Chart debuted on May 27, 1957, under the name CHUM&#x27;s Weekly Hit Parade, was in response to the fast-growing diversity of music that needed to be subdivided and categorized. The CHUM charts were the longest-running Top 40 chart in Canada ending in 1986.

1958 saw its first Canadian rock and roll teen idol Paul Anka, who went to New York City where he auditioned for ABC with the song &quot;Diana&quot;. This song brought Anka instant stardom as it reached number one on the US Billboard charts. &quot;Diana&quot; has gone on to be one of the best selling 45s in music history. US-born rockabilly pioneer Ronnie Hawkins moved to Canada in 1958, where he became a key player in the Canadian blues and rock scene. The 4th of October was declared &quot;Ronnie Hawkins Day&quot; by the city of Toronto when Hawkins was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. He was also inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame and his pioneering contribution to rockabilly has been recognized with induction into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

====1960–1999====
Canadian artists and Canadian ensembles were generally forced to turn toward the United States to establish healthy long lasting careers during the 1960s. Canada would produce some of the world&#x27;s most influential singer-songwriters during this time. Gordon Lightfoot made his first chart appearance in June 1962. Among the most notable is Neil Young who has been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. Leonard Cohen has been inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame and is also a Companion of the Order of Canada. Folk legend Joni Mitchell is an Alberta native, and has been inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Walt Grealis of Toronto started in the music business with Apex Records in 1960, the Ontario distributor for Compo Company. He later joined London Records, where he worked until February 1964, when he then established &quot;RPM&quot; weekly trade magazine. From the first issue of &quot;RPM Weekly&quot; on February 24, 1964, to its final issue on November 13, 2000, &quot;RPM&quot; was the defining charts in Canada.
The American and British counterculture explosion and hippie movement had diverted music to that which was dominated by socially and American politically incisive lyrics by the late 1960s. The music was an attempt to reflect upon the events of the time – civil rights, the war in Vietnam and the rise of feminism. This led to the Canadian government passing Canadian content legislation to help Canadian artists. On January 18, 1971, regulations came into force requiring AM radio stations to devote 30 percent of their musical selections to Canadian content. Although this was (and still is) controversial, it quite clearly contributed to the development of a nascent Canadian pop star system.

With the introduction in the mid-1970s of mainstream music on FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were no longer limited to songs of three minutes&#x27; duration as dictated by AM stations for decades. Other notable musicians who have been one of the largest Canadian exports include the progressive rock band Rush, Triumph and Bryan Adams. In the classical world, homegrown talent Canadian Brass was established in Toronto in 1970.

Country music remained popular in Canada in the 1970s thanks to the CBC&#x27;s The Tommy Hunter show and the adult contemporary radio format which benefited the international stardom of Anne Murray. However, the more mainstream sound would hinder Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors until he would have a revival in the 1990s.

Canada&#x27;s first nationwide music awards began as a reader poll conducted by Canadian music industry trade magazine &quot;RPM Weekly&quot; in December 1964. A similar balloting process continued until 1970 when the &quot;RPM Gold Leaf Awards&quot;, as they were then known, were changed to the Juno Awards. The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences held the first Juno Award ceremony in 1975. This was in response to rectifying the same concerns about promotion of Canadian artists that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission had.

Canadian music changed course in the 1980s and 1990s, the changing fast-paced culture was accompanied by an explosion in youth culture. Until the mid-1960s, little attention was paid to music by Canadian daily newspapers except as news or novelty. With the introduction during the late 1970s of the &quot;music critic&quot;, coverage began to rival that of any other topic. Canadian publications devoted to all styles of music either exclusively or in tandem with more general editorial content directed to young readers, was expanding exponentially.

The influence and innovations of Canadian hip hop came to the foreground in Canada, with musicians Like Maestro Fresh Wes, Snow, and the Dream Warriors, when music videos became an important marketing tool for Canadian musicians, with the debut of MuchMusic in 1984 and MusiquePlus in 1986. Now both English and French Canadian musicians had outlets to promote all forms of music through video in Canada. The networks were not just an opportunity for artists to get their videos played—the networks created VideoFACT, a fund to help emerging artists &quot;produce&quot; their videos.

Canadian women at the end of the 20th century enjoyed greater international commercial success than ever before. Canadian women set a new pinnacle of success, in terms financial, critical and in their immediate and strong influence on their respective genres. They were the women and daughters who had fought for emancipation and equality a generation before. Like Shania Twain, Alanis Morissette and most notable is French-Canadian singer, Celine Dion, who became Canada&#x27;s best-selling music artist, and who, in 2004, received the Chopard Diamond award from the World Music Awards for surpassing 175 million in album sales, worldwide.

===21st century===

The turn of the millennium was a time of incredible nationalism, at least as far as Canadian radio is concerned. The 1971 CRTC rules (30% Canadian content on Canadian radio) finally come into full effect and by the end of the 20th century radio stations would have to play 35% Canadian content. This led to an explosion in the 21st century of Canadian pop musicians dominating the airwaves unlike any era before. In 1996, VideoFACT launched PromoFACT, a funding program to help new artists produce electronic press kits and websites. At about the same time, the CD (cheap to manufacture) replaced the vinyl album and cassette tape (expensive to manufacture). Shortly thereafter, the Internet allowed musicians to directly distribute their music, thus bypassing the selection of the old-fashioned &quot;record label&quot;. Canada&#x27;s mainstream music industry has suffered as a result of the internet and the boom of independent music. The drop in annual sales between 1999, the year that Napster&#x27;s unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing service launched, and the end of 2004 was $465 million.

In 2007, Canada joined the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement talks, whose outcome will have a significant impact on the Canadian music industry. In 2010 Canada introduced new copyright legislation. The amended law makes hacking digital locks illegal, but enshrine into law the ability of purchasers to record and copy music from a CD to portable devices.

The early 2000s saw Canadian independent artists continue to expand their audience into the United States and beyond. Mainstream Canadian artists with global recorded contracts such as Nelly Furtado, Avril Lavigne, Michael Bublé, Nickelback, Drake, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber reached new heights in terms of international success, while dominating the American music charts. The late 2010s and early 2020 saw the deaths of Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip and Neil Peart of Rush.

==Anthems==
Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 years. The earliest, &quot;The Bold Canadian&quot;, was written in 1812.
*&quot;O Canada&quot; – the national anthem adopted in 1980.
*&quot;God Save the King&quot; – Royal Anthem of Canada since 1980.
*&quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; – unofficial old national anthem 1867.
*&quot;Alberta&quot; official anthem of Alberta.
*&quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot; – official anthem of Newfoundland and Labrador.
*&quot;The Island Hymn&quot; – official anthem of Prince Edward Island.
*&quot;Gens du pays&quot; – unofficial anthem of Quebec. Commonly associated with Quebec sovereignty.

==Accolades==

The Canadian Music Hall of Fame established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements. The ceremony is held each year as part of Canada&#x27;s main annual music industry awards, the Juno Awards.

The Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards for Lifetime Artistic Achievement are the foremost honours presented for excellence in the performing arts, in the categories of dance, classical music, popular music, film, and radio and television broadcasting. They were initiated in 1992 by then Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn, and winners receive $25,000 and a medal struck by the Royal Canadian Mint.

Canada also has many specific music awards, both for different genres and for geographic regions:
* CASBY Awards – Canada&#x27;s annual independent and alternative music awards
* Canadian Country Music Awards – Canada&#x27;s annual country music industry awards
* GMA Canada Covenant Awards – Canada&#x27;s national awards for the Gospel music industry
* East Coast Music Awards – annual music appreciation for the East Coast of Canada
* Felix Awards – annual prize for members of the Quebec music industry
* Canadian Folk Music Awards – annual ceremony for achievements in folk and world music

* Western Canadian Music Awards – annual music appreciation for the western part of Canada

==Cultural and regional==
Distinctive music scenes have been an integral part of the cultural landscape of Canada. With Canada being vast in size, the country throughout its history has had regional music scenes, with a wide and diverse accumulation of styles and genres from many different individual communities, such as Inuit music, music of the Maritimes and Canadian fiddle music.

<doc id="248274" wikidata="Q743569" url="?curid=248274" title="Phonetic transcription">
<text>Phonetic transcription (also known as phonetic script or phonetic notation) is the visual representation of speech sounds (or &quot;phones&quot;) by means of symbols. The most common type of phonetic transcription uses a phonetic alphabet, such as the International Phonetic Alphabet.

== Versus orthography ==
The pronunciation of words in all languages changes over time. However, their written forms (orthography) are often not modified to take account of such changes, and do not accurately represent the pronunciation. Words borrowed from other languages may retain the spelling from the original language, which may have a different system of correspondences between written symbols and speech sounds. Pronunciation can also vary greatly among dialects of a language. Standard orthography in some languages, such as English and Tibetan, is often irregular and makes it difficult to predict pronunciation from spelling. For example, the words &quot;bough&quot;, &quot;tough&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;though&quot; and &quot;through&quot; do not rhyme in English even though their spellings might suggest otherwise. Other languages, such as Spanish and Italian have a more consistent (but still imperfect) relationship between orthography and pronunciation, while a few languages may claim to have a fully phonemic spelling system (a phonemic orthography).

For most languages, phonetic transcription makes it possible to show pronunciation with something much nearer to a one-to-one relationship between sound and symbol than is possible with the language&#x27;s orthography. Phonetic transcription allows one to step outside orthography, examine differences in pronunciation between dialects within a given language and identify changes in pronunciation that may take place over time.

A basic principle of phonetic transcription is that it should be applicable to all languages, and its symbols should denote the same phonetic properties whatever the language being transcribed. It follows that a transcription devised for one individual language or group of languages is not a phonetic transcription but an orthography.

== Narrow versus broad; phonemic versus phonetic ==
Phonetic transcription may be used to transcribe the phones of a language. In all systems of transcription there is a distinction between broad transcription and narrow transcription. Broad transcription indicates only the most noticeable phonetic features of an utterance, whereas narrow transcription encodes more information about the phonetic details of the allophones in the utterance. The difference between broad and narrow is a continuum, but the difference between phonemic and phonetic transcription is usually treated as a binary distinction. Phonemic transcription is a particularly broad transcription that disregards all allophonic differences (for example the differences between individual speakers or even whole dialects of the same language). Phonemic transcription provides a representation only of a language&#x27;s abstract word-distinguishing units of sound (phonemes), and thus is not really a phonetic transcription at all (though at times it may coincide with one). Instead, a phonetic transcription focuses on more exact articulatory or acoustic details, whether in a broader or narrower way. A transcription which includes some allophonic detail but is still closely linked to the phonemic structure of an utterance is called an allophonic transcription.

The advantage of narrower transcription is that it can help learners to produce exactly the right sound and allows linguists to make detailed analyses of language variation. The disadvantage is that a narrow transcription is rarely representative of all dialects or speakers of a language. Most American, Canadian, and Australian speakers of English would pronounce the in the word &quot;little&quot; as a tap and the initial as a dark L (often represented as ), but speakers in southern England pronounce the /t/ as (a glottal stop; see t-glottalization) and the second as a vowel resembling (L-vocalization). Thus, on the one hand, phonetically, &quot;little&quot; can be represented as something like in many American, Canadian, and Australian accents but in a southern England accent. Furthermore, in Australian accents especially, the first-syllable vowel of &quot;little&quot; tends to be higher than in North America, leading to the possibility of employing an even narrower phonetic transcription to indicate this, such as . On the other hand, a broad phonemic transcription of &quot;little&quot; is also possible that ignores all the above specifics of these aforementioned dialects; this can be useful in situations where minor details are not important to distinguish or where the emphasis is on overarching patterns. For example, one typical phonemic transcription for the word &quot;little&quot; is , as is common in both British and American English dictionaries. (Slashes, rather than square brackets, are used to indicate phonemic rather than phonetic representations.)

A further disadvantage of narrow transcription is that it involves a large number of symbols and diacritics that may be unfamiliar to nonspecialists. Broad transcription usually allows statements to be made which apply across accents and dialects, and is thus more appropriate for the pronunciation data in ordinary dictionaries, which may discuss phonetic details in the preface but rarely give them for each entry. Most linguists use a narrow transcription only when necessary, and at all other times use a broad transcription.

== Types of notational systems ==
Most phonetic transcription is based on the assumption that linguistic sounds are segmentable into discrete units that can be represented by symbols. Many different types of transcription, or &quot;notation&quot;, have been tried out: these may be divided into &quot;Alphabetic&quot; (which are based on the same principle as that which governs ordinary alphabetic writing, namely that of using one single simple symbol to represent each sound) and &quot;Analphabetic&quot; (notations which are &quot;not&quot; alphabetic) which represent each sound by a composite symbol made up of a number of signs put together.

=== Alphabetic ===

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is the most widely used and well-known of present-day phonetic alphabets and has a long history. It was created in the nineteenth century by European language teachers and linguists. It soon developed beyond its original purpose as a tool of foreign language pedagogy and is now also used extensively as a practical alphabet of phoneticians and linguists. It is found in many dictionaries, where it is used to indicate the pronunciation of words, but most American dictionaries for native English-speakers, e.g., &quot;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot;, avoid phonetic transcription and instead employ &quot;respelling&quot; systems based on the English alphabet, with diacritical marks over the vowels and stress marks. (See Pronunciation respelling for English for a generic version.)

Another commonly encountered alphabetic tradition was originally created by American linguists for the transcription of Native American and European languages and is still commonly used by linguists of Slavic, Indic, Semitic, Uralic (here known as the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet) and Caucasian languages. This is often labeled the Americanist phonetic alphabet despite having been widely used for languages outside the Americas. The principal difference between these alphabets and the IPA is that the specially created characters of the IPA are abandoned in favour of already existing typewriter characters with diacritics (e.g. many characters are borrowed from Eastern European orthographies) or digraphs. Examples of this transcription may be seen in Pike&#x27;s &quot;Phonemics&quot; and in many of the papers reprinted in Joos&#x27;s &quot;Readings in Linguistics 1&quot;. In the days before it was possible to create phonetic fonts for computer printers and computerized typesetting, this system allowed material to be typed on existing typewriters to create printable material.

There are also extended versions of the IPA, for example: Ext-IPA, VoQS, and Luciano Canepari&#x27;s &quot;canIPA&quot;.

==== Aspects of alphabetic transcription ====
The International Phonetic Association recommends that a phonetic transcription should be enclosed in square brackets &quot;[ ]&quot;. A transcription that specifically denotes only phonemic contrasts may be enclosed in slashes &quot;/ /&quot; instead. If one is unsure, it is best to use brackets since by setting off a transcription with slashes, one makes a theoretical claim that every symbol phonemically contrasts for the language being transcribed.

For phonetic transcriptions, there is flexibility in how closely sounds may be transcribed. A transcription that gives only a basic idea of the sounds of a language in the broadest terms is called a &quot;broad transcription&quot;; in some cases, it may be equivalent to a phonemic transcription (only without any theoretical claims). A close transcription, indicating precise details of the sounds, is called a &quot;narrow transcription&quot;. They are not binary choices but the ends of a continuum, with many possibilities in between. All are enclosed in brackets.

For example, in some dialects the English word &quot;pretzel&quot; in a narrow transcription would be , which notes several phonetic features that may not be evident even to a native speaker. An example of a broad transcription is , which indicates only some of the features that are easier to hear. A yet broader transcription would be in which every symbol represents an unambiguous speech sound but without going into any unnecessary detail. None of those transcriptions makes any claims about the phonemic status of the sounds. Instead, they represent certain ways in which it is possible to produce the sounds that make up the word.

There are also several possibilities in how to transcribe the word phonemically, but here, the differences are generally of not precision but analysis. For example, &quot;pretzel&quot; could be or . The latter transcription suggests that there are two vowels in the word even if they cannot both be heard, but the former suggests that there is only one.

Strictly speaking, it is not possible to have a distinction between &quot;broad&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot; within phonemic transcription, since the symbols chosen represent only sounds that have been shown to be distinctive. However, the symbols themselves may be more or less explicit about their phonetic realization. A frequently cited example is the symbol chosen for the English consonant at the beginning of the words &#x27;rue&#x27;, &#x27;rye&#x27;, &#x27;red&#x27;: this is frequently transcribed as /r/, despite the symbol suggesting an association with the IPA symbol which is used for a tongue-tip trill. It is equally possible within a phonemic transcription to use the symbol , which in IPA usage refers to an alveolar approximant; this is the more common realization for English pronunciation in America and England. Phonemic symbols will frequently be chosen to avoid diacritics as much as possible, under a &#x27;one sound one symbol&#x27; policy, or may even be restricted to the ASCII symbols of a typical keyboard, as in the SAMPA alphabet. For example, the English word &quot;church&quot; may be transcribed as , a close approximation of its actual pronunciation, or more abstractly as , which is easier to type. Phonemic symbols should always be backed up by an explanation of their use and meaning, especially when they are as divergent from actual pronunciation as .

Occasionally a transcription will be enclosed in pipes (&quot;| |&quot;). This goes beyond phonology into morphological analysis. For example, the words &quot;pets&quot; and &quot;beds&quot; could be transcribed phonetically as and (in a fairly narrow transcription), and phonemically as and . Because and are separate phonemes in English, they receive separate symbols in the phonemic analysis. However, a native English speaker would recognize that underneath this, they represent the same plural ending. This can be indicated with the pipe notation. If the plural ending is thought to be essentially an &quot;s&quot;, as English spelling would suggest, the words can be transcribed and . If it is essentially a &quot;z&quot;, these would be and .

A double slash (&quot;&quot;) is sometimes used to mark a diaphonemic transcription. Diaphonemic transcriptions accommodate for the variation between the phonemic systems of different varieties or diasystems of a language. For example, if a speaker of variety A pronounces the lexical set with an as in the lexical set , whereas a speaker of variety B pronounces the lexical set with an as in the lexical set , then a diaphonemic transcription that accommodates for variety A and variety B at the same time would transcribe the three lexical sets in three different ways, for instance , , and , where the would mean ‘pronounced in variety A and in variety B.’ Other ways to mark diaphonemic transcriptions include exclamation marks (&quot;! !&quot;) or pipes (&quot;| |&quot;).

To avoid confusion with IPA symbols, it may be desirable to specify when native orthography is being used, so that, for example, the English word &quot;jet&quot; is not read as &quot;yet&quot;. This is done with angle brackets or &quot;chevrons&quot;: . It is also common to italicize such words, but the chevrons indicate specifically that they are in the original language&#x27;s orthography, and not in English transliteration.

=== Iconic ===

In &quot;iconic&quot; phonetic notation, the shapes of the phonetic characters are designed so that they visually represent the position of articulators in the vocal tract. This is unlike alphabetic notation, where the correspondence between character shape and articulator position is arbitrary. This notation is potentially more flexible than alphabetic notation in showing more shades of pronunciation (MacMahon 1996:838–841). An example of iconic phonetic notation is the Visible Speech system, created by Scottish phonetician Alexander Melville Bell (Ellis 1869:15).

=== Analphabetic ===
Another type of phonetic notation that is more precise than alphabetic notation is &quot;analphabetic&quot; phonetic notation. Instead of both the alphabetic and iconic notational types&#x27; general principle of using one symbol per sound, analphabetic notation uses long sequences of symbols to precisely describe the component features of an articulatory gesture (MacMahon 1996:842–844). This type of notation is reminiscent of the notation used in chemical formulas to denote the composition of chemical compounds. Although more descriptive than alphabetic notation, analphabetic notation is less practical for many purposes (e.g. for descriptive linguists doing fieldwork or for speech pathologists transcribing their impressions of speech disorders). As a result, this type of notation is uncommon.

Two examples of this type were developed by the Danish Otto Jespersen (1889) and American Kenneth Pike (1943). Pike&#x27;s system, which is part of a larger goal of scientific description of phonetics, is particularly interesting in its challenge against the descriptive method of the phoneticians who created alphabetic systems like the IPA. An example of Pike&#x27;s system can be demonstrated by the following. A syllabic voiced alveolar nasal consonant ( in IPA) is notated as

: &quot;M&quot;aIlDe&quot;C&quot;VoeIpvnnAP&quot;p&quot;a&quot;a&quot;t&quot;d&quot;tl&quot;t&quot;n&quot;r&quot;ansnsfS&quot;p&quot;v&quot;a&quot;v&quot;d&quot;tlv&quot;t&quot;n&quot;r&quot;anss&quot;s&quot;fT&quot;p&quot;g&quot;a&quot;g&quot;d&quot;tlwv&quot;t&quot;itv&quot;r&quot;ansn&quot;s&quot;f&quot;S&quot;rp&quot;F&quot;Ss

In Pike&#x27;s notation there are 5 main components (which are indicated using the example above):

# &quot;M&quot; – manner of production (i.e., &quot;M&quot;aIlDe)
# &quot;C&quot; – manner of controlling (i.e., &quot;C&quot;VoeIpvnn)
# description of stricture (i.e., AP&quot;p&quot;a&quot;a&quot;t&quot;d&quot;tl&quot;t&quot;n&quot;r&quot;ansnsfS&quot;p&quot;v&quot;a&quot;v&quot;d&quot;tlv&quot;t&quot;n&quot;r&quot;anss&quot;s&quot;fT&quot;p&quot;g&quot;a&quot;g&quot;d&quot;tlwv&quot;t&quot;itv&quot;r&quot;ansn&quot;s&quot;f)
# &quot;S&quot; – segment type (i.e., &quot;S&quot;rp)
# &quot;F&quot; – phonetic function (i.e., &quot;F&quot;Ss)

<text>Paramount Records was an American record label known for its recordings of jazz and blues in the 1920s and early 1930s, including such artists as Ma Rainey, Tommy Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson.

==Early years==
Paramount Records was founded in 1918 by United Phonographs, a subsidiary of the Wisconsin Chair Company, which trademarked its record brand from Port Washington and began issuing records the following year on the Puritan and Paramount labels. Puritan lasted only until 1927, but Paramount, based in the factory of its parent company in Grafton, Wisconsin, published some of the nation&#x27;s most important early blues recordings between 1929 and 1932. The label&#x27;s offices were located in Port Washington, Wisconsin and the pressing plant was located at 1819 S. Green Bay Road in Grafton. The label was managed by Fred Dennett Key. Recordings often occurred at studios in Chicago.

The Wisconsin Chair Company made wooden phonograph cabinets for Edison Records. In 1915 it started making its own phonographs in the name of its subsidiary, the United Phonograph Corporation. It made phonographs under multiple brand names through the end of the decade; the brands failed commercially.

In 1918, a line of records debuted on the Paramount label. They were recorded and pressed by a Chair Company subsidiary, the New York Recording Laboratories, Inc. which, despite its name, was located in the same Wisconsin factory in Port Washington. Advertisements, however, stated: &quot;Paramounts are recorded in our own New York laboratory&quot;.

In its early years, the Paramount label fared only slightly better than the Vista phonograph line. The product had little to distinguish itself. Paramount released pop recordings with average audio quality pressed on average quality shellac. With the coming of electric recording, both the audio fidelity and the shellac quality declined to well below average, although some Paramount records were well pressed on better shellac and have become collectible.

In the early 1920s, Paramount was accumulating debt while producing no profit. Paramount began offering to press records for other companies on a contract basis at low prices.

==Race records==
Paramount was contracted to press discs for Black Swan Records. When the Black Swan company later floundered, Paramount bought out Black Swan and made records by and for African Americans. These so-called race music records became Paramount&#x27;s most famous and lucrative business, especially its 12000 series. It is estimated that a quarter of all &quot;race records&quot; released between 1922 and 1932 were on the Paramount label. The company relied on offices and agents in nearby Chicago to find and record artists for its blues and jazz offerings.

Paramount&#x27;s race record series was launched in 1922 with vaudeville blues songs by Lucille Hegamin and Alberta Hunter. The company had a large mail-order operation which was a key to its early success.

Most of Paramount&#x27;s race music recordings were arranged by black entrepreneur J. Mayo Williams. &quot;Ink&quot; Williams, as he was known, had no official position with Paramount, but he was given wide latitude to bring African American talent to the Paramount recording studios and to market Paramount records to African American consumers. Williams did not know at the time that the &quot;race market&quot; had become Paramount&#x27;s prime business and that he was keeping the label afloat.

Problems with low fidelity and poor pressings continued. Blind Lemon Jefferson&#x27;s 1926 hits, &quot;Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Long Lonesome Blues&quot;, were quickly rerecorded in the superior facilities of Marsh Laboratories, and subsequent releases used the rerecorded version. Both versions were released on compilation albums.

In 1927, Ink Williams moved to competitor Okeh, taking Blind Lemon Jefferson with him for just one recording, &quot;Matchbox Blues&quot;. Paramount&#x27;s recording of the same song can be compared with Okeh&#x27;s on compilation albums. In 1929, Paramount was building a new studio in Grafton, so it sent Charley Patton —&quot;sent up&quot; by Jackson, Mississippi, storeowner H. C. Speir —to the studio of Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, where on June 14 he cut 14 famous sides, which led many to consider him the &quot;Father of the Delta Blues&quot;.

After Williams left Paramount, he placed the business in the hands of his secretary, Aletha Dickerson, who had not been informed that her former employer had quit. Dickerson continued working for Paramount, and eventually moved to the company&#x27;s new headquarters in Grafton. In 1931, she quit when the management, facing hard times, cut her wages.

==Depression, closure, reissues==
The Great Depression drove many record companies out of business. Paramount stopped recording in 1932 and closed in 1935.

Like other record companies during the Great Depression, Paramount sold most of its master recordings as scrap metal. Some of the company&#x27;s recordings were said to have been thrown into the Milwaukee River by disgruntled employees when the company was closing in the mid-1930s. A 2006 episode of the PBS television show &quot;History Detectives&quot; showed divers searching the river for Paramount masters and unsold 78s, but they were unsuccessful. Author Amanda Petrusich also dived in the river looking for records for her 2014 book &quot;Do Not Sell At Any Price&quot;, but did not find any.

When Riverside re-released the original recordings, they used records from the collection of John Hammond.

John Fahey&#x27;s Revenant Records and Jack White&#x27;s Third Man Records issued two volumes of remastered tracks from Paramount&#x27;s catalog, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Paramount Records, Volume One (1917–27)&quot; and &quot;The Rise and Fall of Paramount Records, Volume Two (1928–32)&quot;, on vinyl records with a USB drive for digital access. Each volume features 800 songs, contemporary ads and images (200 in volume one and 90 in volume 2), two books (a history of Paramount and a guide to the artists and recordings) and six 180-gram vinyl LPs, packaged in a hand-crafted oak case modeled after those that carried phonographs in the 1920s.
