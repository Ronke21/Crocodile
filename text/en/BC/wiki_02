<text>R. Daneel Olivaw is a fictional robot created by Isaac Asimov. The &quot;R&quot; initial in his name stands for &quot;Robot,&quot; a naming convention in Asimov&#x27;s future society during Earth&#x27;s early period of space colonization. Daneel is introduced in &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, a serialized story published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; from October to December 1953. The full story was published by Doubleday as a hardcover book in 1954.

In his introduction story, Daneel is said to be not only made in the likeness of one of his creators but is also the first robot physically indistinguishable from humans. Like other robots in Asimov&#x27;s stories, his &quot;positronic brain&quot; is governed by the Three Laws of Robotics. Daneel&#x27;s particular brain and system are more advanced than the average robot. He can convincingly mimic human behavior and reactions, is better able to adapt and evolve through increased knowledge and experience, and can perform &quot;cerebroanalysis&quot;, an ability defined as an &quot;interpretation of the electromagnetic fields of living brain cells&quot; that provides &quot;information of the temperamental and emotional makeup of an individual.&quot; Asimov&#x27;s concept of cerebroanalysis in 1953 predicted magnetic resonance imaging (first demonstrated in 1973), and also its later (and currently debated) use to determine truthfulness or deceit.

Daneel is one of the two protagonists of Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series books &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; (1953), &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot; (1983). In these books, he works with human detective Elijah Baley to solve unusual murders. Along with the murder mystery aspect, the stories focus on discussions regarding space exploration and human societal norms, and show an evolution in both the friendship developing between the two characters and Daneel&#x27;s personal sense of morality. He and Elijah also appear in the short story &quot;Mirror Image&quot; (1972).

Daneel also appears in &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; (1985), a book that acts as a bridge between Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series and his &quot;Foundation&quot; series, the latter of which takes place during and after the age of the galaxy&#x27;s First Empire. In the prequels and sequels to the original &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy, a character is revealed to be Daneel now living under a different identity, meaning he has survived for thousands of years, living through the entire era of the First Empire and beyond. By this point, he has replaced much of his body with new hardware, though his mind still operates under the Three Laws of Robotics.

== Character biography ==
Daneel is a robot built by Roj Nemennuh Sarton and Han Fastolfe, who are Spacer roboticists from the planet Aurora, in the year 4920 AD. Although designed and built by Auroran roboticists, Daneel was constructed on Earth. He is the first humanoid, or &quot;humaniform,&quot; robot ever constructed and is outwardly indistinguishable from a human being. This &quot;undercover&quot; attribute enables him to help New York City Police detective Elijah Baley solve crimes. Daneel and Baley first meet while Baley is investigating the murder of Daneel&#x27;s co-creator Sarton in Spacetown. Daneel is physically a perfect likeness of Dr. Sarton.

Daneel has a broad, high-cheekboned face and short bronze hair lying flatly backward and without a parting. He wears clothes and, in &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, cannot be told apart from a human unless in a situation where he refuses to violate the Three Laws of Robotics, and even in this case is indistinguishable from a particularly altruistic person. In &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, Daneel reveals that he has the capability to perform &quot;cerebroanalysis&quot; enabling him to interpret the emotional makeup of human brain activity. In &quot;Robots and Empire,&quot; Daneel gains the ability to influence the mental state of other creatures, human or robot, and, presumably, animal. Daneel gains this ability as a result of voluntary acceptance of reprogramming instructions from R. Giskard Reventlov.

== Relationship with Elijah Baley ==
Daneel is introduced in the book &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, where he is tasked to assist Elijah Baley in the investigation of the murder of his creator, Roj Nemennuh Sarton. The book shows Earth&#x27;s prejudice against robots, explaining why a humanoid robot was assigned to the case. Initially Baley is suspicious of Daneel and constructs two separate theories in which the Robot is responsible for the murder. The first supposition is that Daneel is in fact Sarton pretending to be a robot; the second supposition is that Daneel lacks the Three Laws. After both theories are disproven, Baley begins to feel a friendship with Daneel. At the same time, watching Baley gives Daneel a more nuanced view of justice, coming to understand that it is better to convert evil to good than to simply destroy evil.

Baley meets Daneel again in &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;, in which he is sent to the Spacer planet Solaria to investigate the murder of Rikaine Delmarre, the husband of Gladia Delmarre. The Solarians are not informed of Daneel&#x27;s robotic nature, as a show of Aurora&#x27;s superiority in the creation of robots. Daneel learns from Baley&#x27;s methods of investigation in both books, which leads to him playing a larger role in &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;.

Daneel also solves a case with Baley in Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;Mirror Image&quot;. This story was written due to popular fan demand for another Baley/Daneel story. After it was written, Asimov was told by some fans that they enjoyed it but had hoped for another novel.

Baley and Daneel&#x27;s last case together takes place on Aurora in the novel &quot;The Robots of Dawn.&quot; The murder victim is a humanoid robot, R. Jander Panell, who belonged to Gladia Delmarre and is physically similar to Daneel. Unknown to the public, Gladia and Jander had a sexual relationship and she secretly regarded the humanoid robot as her husband.

Baley&#x27;s and Daneel&#x27;s friendship grows with each novel, ultimately leading to Daneel being the first of only two robots to ever set foot on a Settler world, when Elijah Baley specifically asks to see him on his deathbed (R. Giskard being the second robot, many years later). Baley sends Daneel away immediately before dying, as witnessing his death would harm Daneel due to the First Law of Robotics. Baley&#x27;s words to reassure Daneel about his death—explaining to him that he is a &quot;mere thread in the vast tapestry of humanity&quot;—assist Daneel in solidifying the Zeroth Law of Robotics.

Baley and the experiences Daneel had with him remain important to Daneel even thousands of years later. When asked about the now mythic figure of Baley (whose existence is now questioned), Daneel states that he was greater than any myth claimed him to be.

== Zeroth Law of Robotics ==
In &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, where Asimov links the &quot;Robot&quot; series with the &quot;Empire&quot; series, Giskard and Daneel often discuss the limitations of the Laws of Robotics, a process lengthened by the fact that their positronic pathways prevent thought along these lines, thus often leading to a temporary loss in the ability to talk or move. By the end of the book, when Daneel has formulated the Zeroth Law of Robotics (&quot;A robot may not harm humanity, or through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm&quot;), Giskard is the first robot to act according to this new law. However, the act of causing harm to a human being in violation of the First Law proves fatally destructive for Giskard, due to the uncertainty of whether or not his actions benefit humanity in the long run – he believes in the law but is unable to point a finger at &quot;humanity&quot; as he could at an individual human, to assess the benefit or harm done. Before deactivating completely, Giskard is able to transfer his powers of being able to read and influence minds to Daneel (by describing the necessary circuits to be rewired in Daneel&#x27;s brain). It is implied that Daneel&#x27;s closer tie to humanity allows him to slowly adapt to the new law with far less risk of destruction.

== The &quot;Foundation&quot; series ==

Together Daneel and Giskard imagine the science of &quot;psychohistory&quot; or laws of humanics, that would enable them to execute the &quot;Zeroth Law&quot; in a quantitative sense. Thousands of years later this would be developed into practical application by mathematician Hari Seldon.

From that time onward, Daneel manipulates the galaxy with the help of his many robot allies. Hari Seldon&#x27;s wife Dors Venabili is the only one of Daneel&#x27;s humanoid robot allies to be shown in the books. He sets up both the Galactic Empire and Gaia in order to create a society that does not need robots. Under the guise of Eto Demerzel, he becomes the First Minister to galactic Emperor Stanel VI and Cleon I.

When Hari Seldon first comes to Trantor in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; (1988), Daneel, under the guise of reporter Chetter Hummin (a play on the words &quot;cheater&quot; and &quot;human&quot;), convinces Hari that the Galactic Empire is dying and that psychohistory must be developed into a practical science in order to save it. As Hummin, he convinces Seldon that Cleon&#x27;s first minister Eto Demerzel is pursuing him and that it is imperative for Hari to escape and to try making psychohistory practical. He introduces Hari to Dors Venabili, who becomes Hari&#x27;s friend, protector, and future wife. At the end of Seldon&#x27;s &quot;Flight&quot; it is revealed that Hummin and Demerzel are actually the same person, and are both false identities of Daneel. Demerzel appears again in &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot; (1993), first as the First Minister as he discusses with Seldon his progress and the Empire&#x27;s future. Demerzel eventually steps down from his post and offers it to Seldon, and disappears. He later makes a brief appearance in the epilogue, which says he was one of the many in attendance at Hari Seldon&#x27;s funeral.

Daneel appears once more in &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; (1986), where Golan Trevize and Janov Pelorat from the Foundation eventually find the radioactive Earth and Daneel&#x27;s base on the Moon and learn about his paternalistic manipulations, including the settlement of Alpha Centauri, the creation of Gaia, and psychohistory.

Based on an independent timeline, Daneel was 19,230 years old during the events of &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;. Daneel is the longest-living Asimov character, as well as the longest living humanoid robot in that universe (being the first humanoid robot created). He is theoretically immortal, because he is a robot. However, his parts need replacing, including his brain, and he eventually has to use a biological brain, as his own becomes more complex each time he replaces it. Daneel mentions that the more complex his brains become, the more fragile they are. At the end of the book, he intends fusing his brain with that of a Solarian, as it has reached the point where an upgrade is no longer possible. Daneel&#x27;s original brain had lasted 10,000 years, approximately half his lifetime. In contrast, his final brain, which was thousands of times more advanced than his first, showed signs of shutting down after only 600 years.

<doc id="240760" wikidata="Q20757547" url="?curid=240760" title="Pilosella aurantiaca">
<text>Pilosella aurantiaca (fox-and-cubs, orange hawkweed, devil&#x27;s paintbrush, grim-the-collier) is a perennial flowering plant in the family Asteraceae that is native to alpine regions of central and southern Europe, where it is protected in several regions.

==Description==
It is a low-growing plant with shallow fibrous roots and a basal rosette of elliptical to lanceolate leaves long and broad. All parts of the plant exude a milky juice. The flowering stem is usually leafless or with just one or two small leaves. The stem and leaves are covered with short stiff hairs (trichomes), usually blackish in color. The stems may reach a height of and have 2–25 capitula (flowerheads), each 1– cm diameter, bundled together at the end of short pedicels. The flowers are orange, almost red, which is virtually invisible to bees, yet they also reflect ultraviolet light, increasing their conspicuousness to pollinators. The flowers are visited by various insects, including many species of bees, butterflies, pollinating flies. The flowers themselves come in a range of colors from a deep rust-orange to a pure yellow and often show striking gradients of color. In the UK, it flowers in June and July.
After flowering, it produces seed heads of the &quot;dandelion clock&quot; type, each individual cypsela (achene-like fruit resembling a seed) being equipped with its own pappus (&quot;parachute&quot;) of white or pale brown hairs evolved as a mechanism for wind-dispersal.

The plant propagates through its wind-dispersed seeds, and also vegetatively via the stolons and shallow rhizomes in autumn or spring.

==Taxonomy==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;aurantiaca&quot; means &#x27;orange&#x27;, referring to the usual colour of the blooms.
The common name of &quot;fox-and-cubs&quot; is due to the appearance of the open flowers (the fox) beside the flower buds (the cubs).

==Distribution==
&quot;Pilosella aurantiaca&quot; is native to parts of Europe (central, eastern, northern, southeastern and southwestern). It is widely naturalized elsewhere, including other parts of Europe such as Great Britain and Ireland, Central Asia, Canada, many states in the United States, Japan and New South Wales.

==Use in horticulture==

&quot;P. aurantiaca&quot; is widely grown as an ornamental plant in gardens for its very decorative flowers. It is often used in wildflower gardens because its bright orange flowers are highly attractive to a wide array of pollinators.

==Use in folk medicine==
Fox and cubs has a long history of use in the folk medicine of Europe, in which it has been used in preparations believed to benefit a variety of diseases, including respiratory infections, digestive problems, and skin conditions. The leaves have also been used to prepare a tisane believed to have tranquilising and sleep-inducing properties. Herbal teas prepared from the leaves and flowers are credited with having diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. The plant itself is believed to have some value in the treatment of cancer any has also been employed as a natural remedy for the control of blood sugar levels and the treatment of high blood pressure.

==In myth and folklore==

Although not native to the British Isles, &quot;P. aurantiaca&quot; was introduced there at least as early as sixteenth century, as is evidenced by the English common name &quot;grim-the-collier&quot;, which is that of a folkloric figure of uncertain origin who features in a once-familiar proverb and subsequently in no fewer than three early modern English plays. In one of these he is actually named in the title: &quot;Grim the Collier of Croydon; or, The Devil and his Dame: with the Devil and Saint Dunston&quot;. The name Grim was originally a by-name of the Germanic deity Odin/Woden, which came later to be associated, in mediaeval mystery plays with sooty devils blackened by the fires of hell. The term collier can designate not only a coal miner or coal merchant but also a charcoal-burner or charcoal merchant and the town of Croydon in Surrey was formerly noted for the number of its charcoal-burners. The reason for the application of the name of this folk villain to &quot;Pilosella aurantiaca&quot; is that it has a sooty appearance due the distinctive black hairs in which the flower heads are covered. The proverb linking colliers to the Devil and his fiery abode runs thus: &#x27;like will to like, quoth the devil to the collier&#x27; i.e. the Devil and the collier are natural companions thanks to their shared black and sooty appearance. This hellish association between, on the one hand the flower with its black hairs and, on the other, the sooty Devil and his equally sooty friend the coal miner is reinforced by the fiery orange colouration of the flowers, reminiscent of both the flames of a coal fire and the unquenchable flames of hellfire – as further recognised in the plant&#x27;s common names &quot;red devil&quot; and &quot;devil’s paintbrush&quot;.
One website claims that the plant features in Celtic mythology, being believed to possess apotropaic powers employed in magical practices intended to bring good luck and ward off evil spirits. It claims further that in certain (unspecified) cultures, it was planted deliberately around homes and gardens to keep them safe from harm. Kew&#x27;s definitive Plants of the World Online website states that the plant is not native to Ireland or the U.K. an aspect of its distribution which rules out its featuring in ancient insular Celtic belief but not its playing a role in the mythology of Brittany (&quot;P. aurantiaca&quot; is native to much of continental Europe – including France).

==Invasive weed==

Orange hawkweed (&quot;Pilosella aurantiaca&quot;) is currently the only hawkweed considered regionally invasive in areas of British Columbia, Canada. It is considered invasive in the East Kootenay, Central Kootenay, Columbia-Shuswap, Thompson-Nicola, Bulkley Nechako, and Cariboo Regional Districts. Invasive hawkweed can replace native vegetation in open, undisturbed natural areas such as meadows, reducing forage and threatening biodiversity. In Victoria and NSW, Australia, hawkweed species are declared as &quot;State Prohibited Weeds&quot; and are controlled under The Bio Security Act 2015. Orange hawkweed is also considered an invasive species in some states in the United States of America, such as Alaska, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Currently there are several eradication programs operating (often employing volunteers) to locate, prevent the spread of and eradicate any &quot;Pilosella&quot; or &quot;Hieracium&quot; plants.

<doc id="240761" wikidata="Q1544863" url="?curid=240761" title="Music of Cuba">
<text>The music of Cuba, including its instruments, performance, and dance, comprises a large set of unique traditions influenced mostly by west African and European (especially Spanish) music. Due to the syncretic nature of most of its genres, Cuban music is often considered one of the richest and most influential regional music in the world. For instance, the son cubano merges an adapted Spanish guitar (tres), melody, harmony, and lyrical traditions with Afro-Cuban percussion and rhythms. Almost nothing remains of the original native traditions, since the native population was exterminated in the 16th century.

Since the 19th century, Cuban music has been hugely popular and influential throughout the world. It has been perhaps the most popular form of regional music since the introduction of recording technology. Cuban music has contributed to the development of a wide variety of genres and musical styles around the globe, most notably in Latin America, the Caribbean, West Africa, and Europe. Examples include rhumba, Afro-Cuban jazz, salsa, soukous, many West African re-adaptations of Afro-Cuban music (Orchestra Baobab, Africando), Spanish fusion genres (notably with flamenco), and a wide variety of genres in Latin America.

==Overview==

Large numbers of enslaved Africans and European, mostly Spanish, immigrants came to Cuba and brought their own forms of music to the island. European dances and folk musics included zapateo, fandango, paso doble and retambico. Later, northern European forms like minuet, gavotte, mazurka, contradanza, and the waltz appeared among urban whites. There was also an immigration of Chinese indentured laborers later in the 19th century.

Fernando Ortiz, the first great Cuban folklorist, described Cuba&#x27;s musical innovations as arising from the interplay (&#x27;transculturation&#x27;) between enslaved Africans settled on large sugar plantations and Spaniards from different regions such as Andalusia and Canary Islands. The enslaved Africans and their descendants made many percussion instruments and preserved rhythms they had known in their homeland. The most important instruments were the drums, of which, there were originally about fifty different types; today only the bongos, congas and batá drums are regularly seen (the timbales are descended from kettle drums in Spanish military bands). Also important are the claves, two short hardwood batons, and the cajón, a wooden box, originally made from crates. Claves are still used often, and wooden boxes (&quot;cajones&quot;) were widely used during periods when the drum was banned. In addition, there are other percussion instruments in use for African-origin religious ceremonies. Chinese immigrants contributed the &quot;corneta china&quot; (Chinese cornet), a Chinese reed instrument still played in the comparsas, or carnival groups, of Santiago de Cuba.

The great instrumental contribution of the Spanish was their guitar, but even more important was the tradition of European musical notation and techniques of musical composition. Hernando de la Parra&#x27;s archives give some of our earliest available information on Cuban music. He reported instruments including the clarinet, violin and vihuela. There were few professional musicians at the time, and fewer still of their songs survive. One of the earliest is &quot;Ma Teodora&quot;, supposed to be related to a freed slave, Teodora Ginés of Santiago de Cuba, who was famous for her compositions. The piece is said to be similar to 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century Spanish popular songs and dances.

Cuban music has its principal roots in Spain and West Africa, but over time has been influenced by diverse genres from different countries. Important among these are France (and its colonies in the Americas), and the United States.

Cuban music has been immensely influential in other countries. It contributed not only to the development of jazz and salsa, but also to the Argentine tango, Ghanaian high-life, West African Afrobeat, Dominican Bachata and Merengue, Colombian Cumbia and Spanish Nuevo flamenco and to the Arabo-Cuban music (Hanine Y Son Cubano) developed by Michel Elefteriades in the 1990s.

The African beliefs and practices certainly influenced Cuba&#x27;s music. Polyrhythmic percussion is an inherent part of African music, as the melody is part of European music. Also, in African tradition, percussion is always joined to song and dance, and a particular social setting. The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized. This creolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music, and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.

== Classical music ==
===18th and 19th centuries===

Among internationally heralded composers of the &quot;serious&quot; genre can be counted the Baroque composer Esteban Salas y Castro (1725–1803), who spent much of his life teaching and writing music for the Church. He was followed in the Cathedral of Santiago de Cuba by the priest Juan París (1759–1845). París was an exceptionally industrious man and an important composer. He encouraged continuous and diverse musical events.p181 Aside from rural music and Afro-Cuban folk music, the most popular kind of urban Creole dance music in the 19th century was the contradanza, which commenced as a local form of the English country dance and the derivative French contredanse and Spanish contradanza. While many contradanzas were written for dance, from the mid-century several were written as light-classical parlor pieces for piano. The first distinguished composer in this style was Manuel Saumell (1818–1870), who is sometimes accordingly hailed as the father of Cuban creole musical development. According to Helio Orovio, &quot;After Saumell&#x27;s visionary work, all that was left to do was to develop his innovations, all of which profoundly influenced the history of Cuban nationalist musical movements.&quot;

In the hands of his successor, Ignacio Cervantes Kavanagh, the piano idiom related to the contradanza achieved even greater sophistication. Cervantes was called by Aaron Copland a &quot;Cuban Chopin&quot; because of his Chopinesque piano compositions. Cervantes&#x27; reputation today rests almost solely upon his famous forty-one &quot;Danzas Cubanas&quot;, which Carpentier said, &quot;occupy the place that the &quot;Norwegian Dances&quot; of Grieg or the &quot;Slavic Dances&quot; of Dvořák occupy in the music of their respective countries&quot;. Cervantes&#x27; never-finished opera, &quot;Maledetto&quot;, is forgotten.

In the 1840s, the habanera emerged as a languid vocal song using the contradanza rhythm. (Non-Cubans sometimes called Cuban contradanzas &quot;habaneras.&quot;) The habanera went on to become popular in Spain and elsewhere. The Cuban contradanza/danza was also an important influence on the Puerto Rican danza, which went on to enjoy its own dynamic and distinctive career lasting through the 1930s. In Cuba, in the 1880s the contradanza/danza gave birth to the danzón, which effectively superseded it in popularity.

Laureano Fuentes (1825–1898) came from a family of musicians and wrote the first opera to be composed on the island, &quot;La Hija de Jefté&quot; (Jefte&#x27;s daughter). This was later lengthened and staged under the title &quot;Seila&quot;. His numerous works spanned all genres. Gaspar Villate (1851–1891) produced abundant and wide-ranging work, all centered on opera.p239 José White (1836–1918), a mulatto of a Spanish father and an Afrocuban mother, was a composer and a violinist of international merit. He learned to play sixteen instruments, and lived, variously, in Cuba, Latin America, and Paris. His most famous work is &quot;La Bella Cubana&quot;, a habanera.

During the middle years of the 19th century, a young American musician Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829–1869) came to Cuba. Gottschalk&#x27;s father was a Jewish businessman from London, and his mother a white creole of French Catholic background. Gottschalk was brought up mostly by his black grandmother and nurse Sally, both from Saint-Domingue. He was a piano prodigy who had listened to the music and seen the dancing in Congo Square, New Orleans from childhood. His period in Cuba lasted from 1853 to 1862, with visits to Puerto Rico and Martinique squeezed in. He composed many creolized pieces, such as the habanera &quot;Bamboula, Op. 2&quot; (Danse de negres) (1845), the title referring to a bass Afro-Caribbean drum; &quot;El cocoye&quot; (1853), a version of a rhythmic melody already present in Cuba; the contradanza &quot;Ojos criollos (Danse cubaine)&quot; (1859) and a version of &quot;María de la O&quot;, which refers to a Cuban mulatto singer. These numbers made use of typical Cuban rhythmic patterns. At one of his farewell concerts he played his &quot;Adiós a Cuba&quot; to huge applause and shouts of &#x27;bravo!&#x27; Unfortunately, his score for the work has not survived. In February 1860 Gottschalk produced a huge work, &quot;La nuit des tropiques&quot;, in Havana. The work used about 250 musicians and a choir of 200 singers plus a tumba francesa group from Santiago de Cuba. He produced another huge concert the following year, with new material. These shows probably dwarfed anything seen in the island before or since, and no doubt were unforgettable for those who attended.p147

===20th-century classical and art music===
Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th a number of composers excel within the Cuban music panorama. They cultivated genres such as the popular song and the concert lied, dance music, the zarzuela and the vernacular theatre, as well as symphonic music. Noteworthy are Hubert de Blanck (1856-1932), José Mauri (1856-1937), Manuel Mauri (1857-1939), José Marín Varona, Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes (1874-1944), Jorge Anckermann (1877-1941), Luis Casas Romero (1882-1950), Mario Valdés Costa (1898-1930), and others.
The work of José Marín Varona links the Cuban musical activity from the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. In 1896, the composer included in his zarzuela &quot;El Brujo&quot; the first Cuban guajira which has been historically documented.

About this piece, composer Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes said: &quot;The honest critique of a not very far day will bestow the author of the immortal guajira of &quot;El Brujo&quot; the honor to which he is undoubtedly entitled at any time&quot;.

Gonzalo Roig (1890–1970) was a major force in the first half of the century. A composer and orchestral director, he qualified in piano, violin and composition theory. In 1922 he was one of the founders of the National Symphony Orchestra, which he conducted. In 1927 he was appointed Director of the Havana School of Music. As a composer he specialized in the zarzuela, a musical theatre form, very popular up to World War II. In 1931 he co-founded a &quot;bufo&quot; company (comic theatre) at the &quot;Teatro Martí&quot; in Havana. He was the composer of the most well-known Cuban zarzuela, &quot;Cecilia Valdés&quot;, based on the famous 19th-century novel about a Cuban mulata. It was premiered in 1932. He founded various organizations and wrote frequently on musical topics.

One of the greatest Cuban pianist/composers of the 20th century was Ernesto Lecuona (1895–1963). Lecuona composed over six hundred pieces, mostly in the Cuban vein, and was a pianist of exceptional quality. He was a prolific composer of songs and music for stage and film. His works consisted of zarzuela, Afro-Cuban and Cuban rhythms, suites and many songs that became Latin standards. They include &quot;Siboney&quot;, &quot;Malagueña&quot; and &quot;The Breeze And I&quot; (&quot;Andalucía&quot;). In 1942 his great hit &quot;Always in my heart&quot; (&quot;Siempre en mi Corazon&quot;) was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song; it lost to &quot;White Christmas&quot;. The Ernesto Lecuona Symphonic Orchestra performed the premiere of Lecuona&#x27;s &quot;Black Rhapsody&quot; in the Cuban Liberation Day Concert at Carnegie Hall on 10 October 1943.

Although their music is rarely played today, Amadeo Roldán (1900–1939) and Alejandro García Caturla (1906–1940) were Cuba&#x27;s symphonic revolutionaries during the first half of the 20th century. They both played a part in Afrocubanismo: the movement in black-themed Cuban culture with origins in the 1920s, and extensively analysed by Fernando Ortiz.

Roldan, born in Paris to a Cuban mulatta and a Spanish father, came to Cuba in 1919 and became the concert-master (first-chair violin) of the new Orquesta Sinfónica de La Habana in 1922. There he met Caturla, at sixteen a second violin. Roldan&#x27;s compositions included &quot;Overture on Cuban themes&quot; (1925), and two ballets: &quot;La Rebambaramba&quot; (1928) and &quot;El milagro de Anaquille&quot; (1929). There followed a series of &quot;Ritmicas&quot; and &quot;Poema negra&quot; (1930) and &quot;Tres toques&quot; (march, rites, dance) (1931). In &quot;Motivos de son&quot; (1934) he wrote eight pieces for voice and instruments based on the poet Nicolás Guillén&#x27;s set of poems with the same title. His last composition was two &quot;Piezas infantiles&quot; for piano (1937). Roldan died at 38 of a disfiguring facial cancer (he had been an inveterate smoker).

After his student days, Caturla lived all his life in the small central town of Remedios, where he became a lawyer to support his growing family. His &quot;Tres danzas cubanas&quot; for symphony orchestra was first performed in Spain in 1929. &quot;Bembe&quot; was premiered in Havana the same year. His &quot;Obertura cubana&quot; won first prize in a national contest in 1938. Caturla was murdered at 34 by a young gambler.

Founded in 1942 under the guidance of José Ardévol (1911–1981), a Catalan composer established in Cuba since 1930, the &quot;Grupo de Renovación Musical&quot; served as a platform for a group of young composers to develop a proactive movement with the purpose of improving and literally renovating the quality of the Cuban musical environment. During its existence from 1942 to 1948, the group organized numerous concerts at the Havana Lyceum in order to present their avant-garde compositions to the general public and fostered within its members the development of many future conductors, art critics, performers and professors. They also started a process of investigation and reevaluation of the Cuban music in general, discovering the outstanding work of Carlo Borbolla and promoting the compositions of Saumell, Cervantes, Caturla and Roldán. The &quot;Grupo de Renovación Musical&quot; included the following composers: Hilario González, Harold Gramatges, Julián Orbón, Juan Antonio Cámara, Serafín Pro, Virginia Fleites, Gisela Hernández, Enrique Aparicio Bellver, Argeliers León, Dolores Torres and Edgardo Martín. Other contemporary Cuban composers that were little or no related at all to the &quot;Groupo de Renovación Musical&quot; were: Aurelio de la Vega, Joaquín Nin-Culmell, Alfredo Diez Nieto and Natalio Galán.

Although, in Cuba, many composers have written both classical and popular creole types of music, the distinction became clearer after 1960, when (at least initially) the regime frowned on popular music and closed most of the night-club venues, whilst providing financial support for classical music rather than creole forms. From then on, most musicians have kept their careers on one side of the invisible line or the other. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, a new crop of classical musicians came onto the scene. The most important of these is guitarist Leo Brouwer, who have made significant contributions to the technique and repertoire of the modern classical guitar, and has been the director of the National Symphony Orchestra of Cuba. His directorship in the early 1970s of the &quot;Grupo de Experimentacion Sonora del ICAIC&quot; was instrumental in the formation and consolidation of the Nueva trova movement.

Other important composers from the early post-revolution period that began in 1959 were: Carlos Fariñas and Juan Blanco, a pioneer of &quot;concrete&quot; and &quot;electroacoustic music&quot; in Cuba.
Closely following the early post-revolution generation, a group of young composers started to attract the attention of the public that attended classical music concerts. Most of them had obtained degrees in reputable Schools outside the country thanks to scholarships granted by the government, like Sergio Fernández Barroso (also known as Sergio Barroso), that received a post-graduate degree from the Superior Academy of Music in Prague, and Roberto Valera, who studied with Witold Rudziński and Andrzej Dobrowolski in Poland. Three other composers belong to this group: Calixto Alvarez, Carlos Malcolm and Héctor Angulo.

In 1962, the North American composer Federico Smith arrives in Havana. He embraced the Cuban nation as his own country and became one of the most accomplished musicians living and working in Cuba at that time. He remained in Cuba until his death, and made an important contribution to the Cuban musical patrimony.

During the early 1970s, a group of musicians and composers, most of them graduated from the National School of Arts and the Havana Conservatory, gathered around an organization recently created by the government as the junior section of UNEAC (National Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba), the Brigada Hermanos Saíz. Some of its member were composers Juan Piñera (nephew of the renowned Cuban writer Virgilio Piñera), Flores Chaviano, Armando Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Danilo Avilés, Magaly Ruiz, Efraín Amador Piñero and José Loyola. Other contemporary composers less involved with the organization were José María Vitier, Julio Roloff, and Jorge López Marín.

After the Cuban Revolution (1959), many future Cuban composers emigrated at a very young age and developed most of their careers outside the country. Within this group are the composers Tania León, Orlando Jacinto García, Armando Tranquilino, Odaline de la Martinez, José Raul Bernardo, Jorge Martín (composer) and Raul Murciano.

===21st-century classical and art music===
During the last decades of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century a new generation of composers emerged into the Cuban classical music panorama. Most of them received a solid musical education provided by the official arts school system created by the Cuban government and graduated from the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). Some of those composers are Louis Franz Aguirre, Ileana Pérez Velázquez, Keila María Orozco, Viviana Ruiz, Fernando (Archi) Rodríguez Alpízar, Yalil Guerra, Eduardo Morales Caso, Ailem Carvajal Gómez, Irina Escalante Chernova and Evelin Ramón. All of them have emigrated and currently live and have worked in other countries.

===Electroacoustic music in Cuba===

Juan Blanco was the first Cuban composer to create an electroacoustic piece in 1961. This first composition, titled &quot;Musica Para Danza&quot;, was produced with just an oscillator and three common tape recorders. Access to the necessary technological resources to produce electroacoustic music was always very limited for anyone interested. For this reason, it was not until 1969 that another Cuban composer, Sergio Barroso, dedicated himself to the creation of electroacoustic musical compositions.
In 1970, Juan Blanco began to work as a music advisor for the Department of Propaganda of ICAP (Insituto Cubano de Amistad con Los Pueblos). In this capacity, he created electroacoustic music for all the audiovisual materials produced by ICAP. After nine years working without restitution, Blanco finally obtained financing to set up an Electroacoustic Studio to be used for his work. He was appointed as Director of the Studio, but under the condition that he should be the only one to use the facility.

After a few months, and without asking for permission, he opened the Electroacoustic Studio to all composers interested in working with electroacoustic technology, thus creating the ICAP Electroacoustsic Music Workshop (TIME), where he himself provided training to all participants. In 1990, the ICAP Workshop changed its name to Laboratorio Nacional de Música Electroacústica (LNME) and its main objective was to support and promote the work of Cuban electroacoustic composers and sound artists.

Some years later, another electroacoustic music studio was created at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). The Estudio de Música Electroacústica y por Computadoras (EMEC), currently named Estudio Carlos Fariñas de Arte Musical (Carlos Fariñas Studio of Musical Electroacoustic Art), is intended to provide electroacoustic music training to the composition students during the last years of their careers.

After 1970, Cuban composers such as Leo Brouwer, Jesús Ortega, Carlos Fariñas and Sergio Vitier began also creating electroacoustic pieces; and in the 1980s a group of composers that included Edesio Alejandro, Fernando (Archi) Rodríguez Alpízar, Marietta Véulens, Mirtha de la Torre, Miguel Bonachea and Julio Roloff started receiving instruction and working at the ICAP Electroacoustic Studio. Cuban composers that have utilized elecotroacoustics technology include Argeliers León, Juan Piñera, Roberto Valera, José Loyola, Ileana Pérez Velázquez and José Angel Pérez Puentes.
Most Cuban composers that established their residence outside Cuba have worked with electroacoustic technology. These include composers Aurelio de la Vega, Armando Tranquilino, Tania León, Orlando Jacinto García, Armando Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Ailem Carvajal Gómez and Irina Escalante Chernova.

===Classical guitar in Cuba===
====From the 16th to the 19th century====
The guitar (as it is known today or in one of its historical versions) has been present in Cuba since the discovery of the island by Spain. As early as the 16th century, a musician named Juan Ortiz, from the village of Trinidad, is mentioned by famous chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo as &quot;gran tañedor de vihuela y viola&quot; (&quot;a great performer of the vihuela and the guitar&quot;). Another &quot;vihuelista&quot;, Alonso Morón from Bayamo, is also mentioned in the Spanish conquest chronicles during the 16th century.
A disciple of famous Spanish guitarist Dionisio Aguado, José Prudencio Mungol was the first Cuban guitarist trained in the Spanish guitar tradition. In 1893 he performed at a much-acclaimed concert in Havana, after returning from Spain. Mungol actively participated in the musical life of Havana and was a professor at the Hubert de Blanck conservatory.

====20th century and beyond====

Severino López was born in Matanzas. He studied guitar in Cuba with Juan Martín Sabio and Pascual Roch, and in Spain with renowned Catalan guitarist Miguel Llobet. Severino López is considered the initiator in Cuba of the guitar school founded by Francisco Tárrega in Spain.

Clara Romero (1888-1951), founder of the modern Cuban School of Guitar, studied in Spain with Nicolás Prats and in Cuba with Félix Guerrero. She inaugurated the guitar department at the Havana Municipal Conservatory in 1931, where she also introduced the teachings of the Cuban folk guitar style. She created the Guitar Society of Cuba (Sociedad Guitarrística de Cuba) in 1940, and also the &quot;Guitar&quot; (Guitarra) magazine, with the purpose of promoting the Society&#x27;s activities. She was the professor of many Cuban guitarists including her son Isaac Nicola and her daughter Clara (Cuqui) Nicola.

After studying with his mother, Clara Romero, at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, Isaac Nicola (1916 – 1997) continued his training in Paris with Emilio Pujol, a disciple of Francisco Tárrega. He also studied the vihuela with Pujol and researched about the guitar&#x27;s history and literature.

====Modern Cuban Guitar School====

After the Cuban revolution in 1959, Isaac Nicola and other professors such as Marta Cuervo, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola, Marianela Bonet and Leopoldina Núñez were integrated to the national music schools system, where a unified didactical method was implemented. This was a nucleus for the later development of a national Cuban Guitar School with which a new generation of guitarists and composers collaborated.

Maybe the most important contribution to the modern Cuban guitar technique and repertoire comes from Leo Brouwer (born 1939). The grandson of Ernestina Lecuona, sister of Ernesto Lecuona, Brouwer began studying the guitar with his father and after some time continued with Isaac Nicola. He taught himself harmony, counterpoint, musical forms and orchestration before completing his studies at the Juilliard School and the University of Hartford.

====New generations====
Since the 1960s, several generations of guitar performers, professors and composers have been formed under the Cuban Guitar School at educational institutions such as the Havana Municipal Conservatory, the National School of Arts, and the Instituto Superior de Arte. Others, such as Manuel Barrueco, a concertist of international renown, developed their careers outside the country. Among many other guitarists related to the Cuban Guitar School are Carlos Molina, Sergio Vitier, Flores Chaviano, Efraín Amador Piñero, Armando Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Martín Pedreira, Lester Carrodeguas, Mario Daly, José Angel Pérez Puentes and Teresa Madiedo. A younger group includes guitarists Rey Guerra, Aldo Rodríguez Delgado, Pedro Cañas, Leyda Lombard, Ernesto Tamayo, Miguel Bonachea, Joaquín Clerch and Yalil Guerra.

===Classical piano in Cuba===
After its arrival in Cuba at the end of the 18th century, the pianoforte (commonly called piano) rapidly became one of the favorite instruments among the Cuban population. Along with the humble guitar, the piano accompanied the popular Cuban &quot;guarachas&quot; and &quot;contradanzas&quot; (derived from the European Country Dances) at salons and ballrooms in Havana and all over the country. As early as in 1804, a concert program in Havana announced a vocal concert &quot;accompanied at the fortepiano by a distinguished foreigner recently arrived&quot; and in 1832, Juan Federico Edelmann (1795-1848), a renowned pianist, son of a famous Alsatian composer and pianist, arrived in Havana and gave a very successful concert at the Teatro Principal. Encouraged by the warm welcome, Edelmann decided to stay in Havana, and he was very soon promoted to an important position within the Santa Cecilia Philharmonic Society. In 1836, he opened a music store and publishing company.

One of the most prestigious Cuban musicians, Ernesto Lecuona (1895-1963), began studying piano with his sister Ernestina and continued with Peyrellade, Saavedra, Nin and Hubert de Blanck. A child prodigy, Lecuona gave a concert, at age five, at the Círculo Hispano. When he graduated from the National Conservatory, he was awarded the First Prize and the Gold Medal of his class by unanimous decision of the board. He is by far the Cuban composer of greatest international recognition and his contributions to the Cuban piano tradition are considered exceptional.

===Classical violin in Cuba===
===From the 16th to the 18th century===

Bowed stringed instruments have been present in Cuba since the 16th century. Musician Juan Ortiz from the Ville of Trinidad is mentioned by chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo as a &quot;great performer of &quot;vihuela&quot; and &quot;viola&quot;. On In 1764, Esteban Salas y Castro, became the new chapel master of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral, and to fulfill his musical duties he counted with a small vocal-instrumental group that included two violins. In 1793, numerous colonists fleeing from the slave revolt in Saint Domingue arrived in Santiago de Cuba, and an orchestra consisting of a flute, oboe, clarinet, trumpet, three horns, three violins, viola, two violoncellos, and percussion was founded.

====From the 18th to the 19th century====

During the transition from the 18th to the 19th centuries, the Havanese Ulpiano Estrada (1777–1847) offered violin lessons and conducted the Teatro Principal orchestra from 1817 to 1820. Apart from his activity as a violinist, Estrada kept a very active musical career as a conductor of numerous orchestras, bands and operas, and composing many contradanzas and other dance pieces, such as minuets and valses.

José Vandergutch, Belgian violinist, arrived at Havana along with his father Juan and brother Francisco, also violinists. They later returned to Belgium, but José established his permanent residence in Havana, where he acquired great recognition. Vandergutch offered numerous concerts as a soloist and accompanied by several orchestras, around the mid-19th century. He was a member of the Classical Music Association and also a Director of The &quot;Asociación Musical de Socorro Mutuo de La Habana.&quot;

Within the universe of the classical Cuban violin during the 19th century, there are two outstanding Masters that may be considered among the greatest violin virtuosos of all time; they are José White Lafitte y Claudio Brindis de Salas Garrido.

After receiving his first musical instruction from his father, the virtuoso Cuban violinist José White Lafitte (1835–1918) offered his first concert in Matanzas on March 21, 1854. In that presentation he was accompanied by the famous American pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk, whom encouraged him to further his musical instruction in Paris, and also collected funds for that purpose.

José White studied musical composition in the Conservatoire de Paris from 1855 to 1871. Ten months after his arrival he won the first prize in the violin category on the Conservatorie&#x27;s contest and was highly praised by Gioachino Rossini. Later he was a professor of the renowned violinists George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud.

From 1877 to 1889, White was appointed as Director of the Imperial Conservatory in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, where he also served as court musician of the Emperor Pedro II. Later he returned to Paris, where he stayed until his death. The famous violin named &quot;Swan&#x27;s song&quot; was his preferred instrument and his most famous composition is the Habanera &quot;La bella cubana&quot;. White also composed many other pieces, including a concert for violin and orchestra.

Claudio José Domingo Brindis de Salas y Garrido (1852–1911) was a renowned Cuban violinist, son of the also famous violinist, double-bassist and conductor Claudio Brindis de Salas (1800-1972), which conducted one of the most popular orchestras of Havana during the first half of the 19th century, named &quot;La Concha de Oro&quot; (The Golden Conch). Claudio José surpassed the fame and expertise of his father and came to acquire international recognition.

Claudio Brindis de Salas Garrido began his musical studies with his father and continued with Maestros José Redondo and the Belgian José Vandergutch. He offered his first concert in Havana in 1863, in which Vandegutch participated as accompanist. The famous pianist and composer Ignacio Cervantes also participated in that event.

According with the contemporary critique, Brindis de Salas was considered one of the most outstanding violinists of his time at an international level. Alejo Carpentier referred to him as: &quot;The most outstanding black violinist from the 19th century... something without any precedent in the musical history of the continent&quot;.

The French government named him member of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur, and gave him a nobility title of &quot;Baron&quot;. In Buenos Aires he received a genuine Stradivarius, and while living in Berlin he married a German lady, was named Chamber Musician of the Emperor and received an honorary citizenship from that country. Brindis de Salas died poor and forgotten in 1911 from tuberculosis, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1930 his remains were transferred to Havana with great honors.

Another outstanding Cuban violinist from the 19th century was Rafael Díaz Albertini (1857–1928). He studied violin with José Vandergutch and Anselmo López (1841-1858), well known Havanese violinist that was dedicated also to music publishing. In 1870, Albertini travelled to Paris with the purpose of perfecting his technique with famous violinist Jean-Delphin Alard, and in 1875 received First prize in the Paris Contest, in which he subsequently participated as a Juror. He toured extensively through the world, accompanied some times by prestigious Masters such as Hugo Wolf and Camille Saint-Saëns. In 1894 he made presentations, along with Ignacion Cervantes, through the most important cities of Cuba.
Prominent Cuban violinists from the second half of the 19th century and the first of the 20th include Manuel Muñoz Cedeño (b. 1813), José Domingo Bousquet (b. 1823), Carlos Anckermann (b. 1829), Antonio Figueroa (b. 1852), Ramón Figueroa (b. 1862), Juan Torroella (b.1874), Casimiro Zertucha (b. 1880), Joaquín Molina (b. 1884), Marta de La Torre (1888), Catalino Arjona (b. 1895) and Diego Bonilla (1898-).

====From the 20th to the 21st century====

During the first half of the 20th century the name of Amadeo Roldán stands out (1900–1939), because apart from an excellent violinist, professor and conductor, Roldán is considered one of the most important Cuban composers of all time.

After his graduation at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1935 at 16 years old, the renowned Cuban violinist Ángel Reyes (1919–1988) developed a very successful career as a soloist and also accompanied by prestigious orchestras of many countries. He established his residence in the United States at a very young age, obtained an award in the Ysaÿe Contest in Brussels and was a professor at the Michigan and Northwestern Universities, until his retirement in 1985.

Eduardo Hernández Asiaín (1911-2010) was born in Havana, began his musical studies at a very early age and offered his first concert when seven years old. When he was 14, he obtained the First Award at the Municipal Conservatory of Havana and was appointed as Concertino of the Havana Symphony Orchestra. In 1932, he travelled to Madrid to further his musical education with professors Enrique Fernández Arbós and Antonio Fernández Bordas. Since 1954, Hernández Asiaín performed as a soloist with the orchestras from the Pasdeloup Concert Society and the Radiodiffusion française in Paris, the &quot;Orquesta Nacional de España&quot;, the &quot;Orquesta Sinfónica de Bilbao&quot;, the &quot;Orquesta de Cámara de Madrid&quot; and the &quot;Orquesta Sinfónica y de Cámara de San Sebastián&quot;, of which he is the founder. In 1968, he was appointed as First Violin of the &quot;Cuarteto Clásico&quot; of RTVE, participating with pianist Isabel Picaza González in the &quot;Quinteto Clásico de RNE&quot;, with which he offered concerts and made numerous recordings in Spain and other countries. He also toured extensively through the US.

Other prominent Cuban violinists from the first half of the 20th century are: Robero Valdés Arnau (1919-1974), Alberto Bolet and Virgilio Diago.

After 1959, already in the post revolutionary period, stands out a Cuban violinist that has made a substantial contribution, not just to the development of the violin and the bowed string instruments, but also to the national musical culture in general.

Evelio Tieles began to study music in Cuba with his father, Evelio Tieles Soler, when he was seven years old, and continued later with professor Joaquín Molina. Between 1952 and 1954, Tieles studied violin in Paris, France, with Jacques Thibaud and René Benedetti. In 1955 he returned to Paris and studied at the National Superior Music Conservatory in that city, and in 1958, he continued his musical training at Conservatorio Tchaikovsky in Moscú, where he was a disciple of renowned violinists David Oistrakh and Igor Oistrakh. Tieles graduated in 1963 and by recommendation of the Conservatory he pursued his master&#x27;s degree from 1963 to 1966, with the same mentioned professors. Tieles received also professional training from the prestigious violinists Henryk Szeryng and Eduardo Hernández Asiaín.

Evelio Tieles has offered numerous presentations as a concert performer, in a duo with his brother, pianist Cecilio Tieles, or accompanied by the Cuban National Symphony Orchestra and other symphonic and chamber ensembles. He has performed along with prestigious conductors such as Thomas Sanderling, Boris Brott, Enrique González Mántici y Manuel Duchesne Cuzán, among others.

Tieles has established his residence in Spain since 1984, and he teaches violin in the Vila-Seca Conservatory, in the province of Tarragona, where he has been appointed as &quot;Professor Emeritus&quot;. He has also served at the Superior Conservatory of the Barcelona Lyceum as Chief of the Chamber Music Department (1991–1998), Head of the Division of Bowed String Instruments (1986-2002) and Academic Director (2000–2002).

Apart from his outstanding career as a concert performer and professor, during the Post-Revolutionary period, Tieles promoted and organized in Cuba the bowed string instruments training, fundamentally for the violin.

Another prominent violinist is professor Alla Tarán (1941). She was formed as a violinist in her native Ukraine and worked as a professor of Chamber Ensemble Practice. Tarán established her residence in Cuba since 1969.

Alfredo Muñoz (1949) began studying the violin at Conservatorio Orbon in Havana, Cuba, and subsequently continued at the National School of Arts and the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). He joined the National Symphony Orchestra as a violinist in 1972 and since then has been very active as a soloist and a member of the White Trio, in Cuba and abroad. He is currently a professor at the Instituto Superior de Artes (ISA).

Other Cuban violinists that have developed their careers between the 20th and the 21st century are: Armando Toledo (1950), Julián Corrales (1954), Miguel del Castillo and Ricardo Jústiz.

====21st century====

Already at the beginning of the 21st century the violinists Ilmar López-Gavilán, Mirelys Morgan Verdecia, Ivonne Rubio Padrón, Patricia Quintero and Rafael Machado are worthy of note.

===Opera in Cuba===
Opera has been present in Cuba since the latest part of the 18th century, when the first full-fledged theater, called Coliseo, was built. Since then to present times, the Cuban people have highly enjoyed opera, and many Cuban composers have cultivated the operatic genre, sometimes with great success at an international level. The best Cuban lyrical singer in the 20th century was the operatic tenor Francisco Fernandez Dominicis (Italian name: Francesco Dominici) (1885-1968). The best Cuban female lyrical singer in the 20th century was the mezzo-soprano Marta Perez (1924-2009). She sang at La Scala in Milan, Italy in 1955.

====The 19th century====
The first documented operatic event in Havana took place in 1776. That presentation was mentioned in a note published in the newspaper &quot;Diario de La Habana&quot; on December 19, 1815: &quot;Today, Wednesday 19th of the current, if the weather allows, the new tragic opera of merit in three acts that contains 17 pieces of music, titled &quot;Dido Abandoned&quot; will be performed ... This is one of the premiere dramas from the French theater. In Italy, the one composed by renowned Metastasio deserved a singular applause, and was sung in this city on October 12, 1776.&quot;
Cristóbal Martínez Corrés was the first Cuban opera composer, but his works, such as &quot;El diablo contrabandista&quot; and &quot;Don papanero&quot;, were never premiered and have not been preserved until the present time. Born in Havana, in 1822, composer and pianist Martínez Corrés established his residence together with his family in France when he was nine years old; later they went to Italy. Due to his premature death, a third opera, named &quot;Safo&quot;, never surpassed an early creative stage. Martínez Corrés died in Genoa, in 1842.

Gaspar Villate y Montes was born in Havana, in 1851 and since an early age he showed a great musical talent. As a child, he began to study piano with Nicolás Ruiz Espadero and in 1867, when he was 16 years old, he composed his first opera on a drama by Victor Hugo, titled &quot;Angelo, tirano de Padua&quot;. A year later, at the beginning of the 1868 war, he travelled to the United States with his family, and upon his return to Havana in 1871 he wrote another opera, called &quot;Las primeras armas de Richelieu&quot;.

Villate travelled to France to continue his music studies in the Paris Conservatory, where he received classes from François Bazin, Victorien de Joncieres and Adolphe Danhauser. He composed numerous instrumental pieces such as &quot;contradanzas&quot;, &quot;habaneras&quot;, &quot;romances&quot; and &quot;waltzes&quot;, and in 1877 he premiered with great audience acclaim his opera &quot;Zilia&quot; in Paris, which was presented in Havana in 1881. Since then, Villate focused his efforts mainly in opera and composed pieces such as &quot;La Zarina&quot; and &quot;Baltazar&quot;, premiered at La Haya and Teatro Real de Madrid respectively. It is known that he worked on an opera with a Cuban theme called &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, but its manuscript has been lost.

Villate died in Paris in 1891, soon after starting to compose a lyrical drama called &quot;Lucifer&quot;, from which some fragments have been preserved.

====From 1901 to 1959====

Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes was born in Havana, in 1874, within an artistic family; his father was a writer and his mother a pianist and singer. He began his musical studies at Conservatorio Hubert de Blanck and later took classes from Carlos Anckermann. He received also a law degree in 1894. When Sánchez de Fuentes was 18 years old, he composed the famous &quot;Habanera &quot;Tú&quot;&quot;, which became an extraordinary international success. Alejo Carpentier said it was &quot;the most famous Habanera&quot;.

On October 26, 1898, Sánchez de Fuentes premiered at the Albisu Theatre in Havana his first opera, called &quot;Yumuri&quot;, based on the island&#x27;s colonization theme. In it, an aborigine princess falls in love with a handsome Spanish conqueror, who abducts her at the wedding ceremony with another indigenous character. At the end, while escaping, both suffer a tragic death during an earthquake. Sánchez de Fuentes would go on to compose another five operas: &quot;El Náufrago&quot; (1901), &quot;Dolorosa&quot; (1910), &quot;Doreya&quot; (1918), &quot;El Caminante&quot; (1921) and &quot;Kabelia&quot; (1942).

====From 1960 to present time====

One of the most active and outstanding composers of his generation, Sergio Fernández Barroso (also known as Sergio Barroso) (1946), is the author of an opera called &quot;La forma del camino&quot;, which also possesses the complementary title of &quot;s-XIV-69&quot; (which means &quot;Siglo XIV – 1969&quot;). With an approximate duration of 60 minutes, this piece utilizes as a script a story from the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; (the sacred text of the Maya culture) about the mythic brothers Hunahpu and Ixbalanqué. The score includes soloists and a choir of nine mixed voices, accompanied by an instrumental group and an electro-acoustic quadraphonic system. The scene requires a stage elevated over the choir spatial position, which members wear dinner jackets, in opposition to the more casual attire of the soloists. All singers wear Indian masks.

Most recently the work of two young Cuban composers stand out, Jorge Martín (composer) and Louis Franz Aguirre.

Jorge Martín (1959) was born in Santiago de Cuba and established his residence in the US at a very young age. He studied musical composition at the Yale and Columbia Universities. He has composed three lyric pieces: &quot;Beast and Superbeast&quot;, a series of four operas in one act each, based on short stories by Saki; &quot;Tobermory&quot;, opera in one act that obtained first prize in the Fifth Biennial of the National Opera Association (USA), and has been presented in several cities of the United States; and &quot;Before Night Falls&quot;, an opera based on the famous autobiography of the Cuban novelist, playwright and poet Reinaldo Arenas, renowned dissident from the Fidel Castro government.
Louis Franz Aguirre (1968) is currently one of the most prolific and renowned Cuban composers at an international level. His catalog includes four operatic works: &quot;Ebbó&quot; (1998), premiered on January 17, 1999, at the Brotfabrik Theater in Bonn, Germany; &quot;Ogguanilebbe&quot; (Liturgy of the divine word) (2005), premiered in the Salla dil Parlamento d&#x27;il Castello di Udine, Italy; &quot;Yo el Supremo&quot; (Comic play with Dictator in one Act), premiered on October 27, 2015, in the Teatro Galileo, Madrid, Spain; and &quot;The way the dead love&quot; (Theogony: an operatic manifest), commissioned by the Lydenskab Ensemble and financed by KODA, Denmark. It premiered on February 24, 2017, in Godsbanen, Aarhus, Denmark, as part of the &quot;Århus European Capital of Culture 2017&quot;.

==Musicology in Cuba==
Throughout the years, the Cuban nation has developed a wealth of musicological material created by numerous investigators and experts on this subject. The work of some authors who provided information about the music in Cuba during the 19th century was usually included in chronicles covering a more general subject. The first investigations and studies specifically dedicated to the musical art and practice did not appear in Cuba until the beginning of the 20th century.

Some important personalities that have contributed to musicological studies in Cuba are Fernando Ortiz, Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes, Emilio Grenet, Alejo Carpentier, Argeliers León, Maria Teresa Linares, Pablo Hernández Balaguer, Alberto Muguercia and Zoila Lapique.

A second generation of musicologists formed after the Cuban revolution of 1959 include Zoila Gómez, Victoria Elí, Alberto Alén Pérez, Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández and Leonardo Acosta.

Most recently, a group of young Cuban musicologists have earned a well deserved reputation within the international academic field, due to their solid investigative work. Some of the most prominent members of this group are Miriam Escudero Suástegui, Liliana González Moreno, Iván César Morales Flores and Pablo Alejandro Suárez Marrero.

==Popular music==
===Hispanic heritage===
The first popular music played in Cuba after the Spanish conquest was brought by the Spanish conquerors themselves, and was most likely borrowed from the Spanish popular music in vogue during the 16th century. From the 16th to the 18th century some danceable songs that emerged in Spain were associated with Hispanic America, or considered to have originated in America. Some of these songs with picturesque names such as Sarabande, Chaconne, Zambapalo, Retambico and Gurumbé, among others, shared a common trait, its characteristic rhythm called Hemiola or Sesquiáltera (in Spain).

This rhythm has been described as the alternation or superposition of a duple meter and a triple meter ( + ), and its utilization was widespread in the Spanish territory since at least the 13th century, where it appears in one of the Cantigas de Santa María (Como poden per sas culpas).

Hemiola or Sesquiáltera is also a typical rhythm within the African musical traditions, both from the North of the Continent as from the South. Therefore, it is quite probable that the original song-dances brought by the Spanish to America already included elements from the African culture with which the enslaved Africans that arrived to the Island were familiar; and they further utilized them in order to create new creole genres.

The well known Son de la Ma Teodora, an ancient Cuban song, as well as the first Cuban autochthonous genres, Punto and Zapateo, show the Sesquiáltera rhythm on their accompaniment, which greatly associate those genres to the Spanish song-dances from the 16th to the 18th centuries.

==Música campesina (peasant music)==
It seems that Punto and Zapateo Cubano were the first autochthonous musical genres of the Cuban nation. Although the first printed sample of a Cuban Creole Zapateo (Zapateo Criollo) was not published until 1855 in the &quot;Álbum Regio of Vicente Díaz de Comas&quot;, it is possible to find references about the existence of those genres since long time before. Its structural characteristics have survived almost unaltered through a period of more than two hundred years and they are usually considered the most typically Hispanic Cuban popular music genres. 
Cuban musicologists María Teresa Linares, Argeliers León and Rolando Antonio Pérez coincide in thinking that Punto and Zapateo are based on Spanish dance –songs (such as chacone and sarabande) that arrived first at the most important population centers such as Havana and Santiago de Cuba and then spread throughout the surrounding rural areas, where they were adopted and modified by the peasant (campesino) population later.

===Punto guajiro===

Punto guajiro or Punto Cubano, or simply Punto, is a sung genre of Cuban music, an improvised poetic-music art that emerged in the western and central regions of Cuba during the 19th century. Although Punto appears to come from an Andalusian origin, it is a true Cuban genre because of its creole modifications.

Punto is played by a group with various types of plucked string instruments: the tiple (a treble guitar currently in disuse), the Spanish guitar, the Cuban tres, and the laúd. The word punto refers to the use of a plucked technique (punteado), rather than strumming (rasgueado). Also some percussion instruments have been utilized such as the clave, the güiro and the guayo ( a metallic scraper). Singers gather themselves in contending teams, and improvise their lines.

They sing fixed melodies called &quot;tonadas&quot; which are based on a meter of ten strophe verses called &quot;décimas&quot;, with intervals between stanzas to give the singers some time to prepare the next verse. Early compositions were sometimes recorded and published, as were the names of some of the singers and composers. Beginning around 1935, Punto reached a peak of popularity on Cuban radio.

Punto was one of the first Cuban genres recorded by American companies at the beginning of the 20th century, but later, interest waned and little effort was made to continue recording the live radio performances. A fan of this genre, stenographer Aida Bode, wrote down many verses as they were broadcast and, in 1997, her transcriptions were published in book form.

Celina González and Albita Rodríguez both sang Punto at the beginning of their careers, proving that the genre is still alive. Celina had one of the greatest voices in popular music, and her supporting group Campo Alegre was outstanding. For aficionados, however, Indio Naborí (Sabio Jesús Orta Ruiz, b. 30 September 1922) is the greatest name in Punto for his &quot;decima&quot; poetry, which he wrote daily for the radio and newspapers. He is also a published author with several collections of his poetry, much of which has a political nueva trova edge.

===Zapateo===


Zapateo is a typical dance of the Cuban &quot;campesino&quot; or &quot;guajiro,&quot; of Spanish origin. It is a dance of pairs, involving tapping of the feet, mostly performed by the male partner. Illustrations exist from previous centuries and today it survives cultivated by Folk Music Groups as a fossil genre. It was accompanied by tiple, guitar and güiro, in combined and rhythm (hemiola), accented on the first of every three quavers.

===Guajira===

A genre of Cuban song similar to the Punto cubano and the Criolla. It contains bucolic countryside lyrics, similar to décima poetry. Its music shows a mixture of and rhythms called Hemiola. According to Sánchez de Fuentes, its first section is usually presented in a minor key, and its second section in its direct major relative key.
The term Guajira is now used mostly to describe a slow dance music in time, a fusion of the Guajira and the Son (called Guajira-Son). Singer and guitarist Guillermo Portabales was the most outstanding representative of this genre.

===Criolla===

Criolla is a genre of Cuban music which is closely related to the music of the Cuban Coros de Clave and a genre of Cuban popular music called Clave.

The Clave became a very popular genre in the Cuban vernacular theater and was created by composer Jorge Anckermann based on the style of the Coros de Clave. The Clave served, in turn, as a model for the creation of a new genre called Criolla. According to musicologist Helio Orovio, &quot;Carmela&quot;, the first Criolla, was composed by Luis Casas Romero in 1909, which also created one of the most famous Criollas of all time, &quot;El Mambí&quot;.

==African heritage==

=== Origins of Cuban African groups ===

Clearly, the origin of African groups in Cuba is due to the island&#x27;s long history of slavery. Compared to the US, slavery started in Cuba much earlier and continued for decades afterwards. Cuba was the last country in the Americas to abolish the importation of slaves, and the second last to free the slaves. In 1807 the British Parliament outlawed slavery, and from then on the British Navy acted to intercept Portuguese and Spanish slave ships. By 1860 the trade with Cuba was almost extinguished; the last slave ship to Cuba was in 1873. The abolition of slavery was announced by the Spanish Crown in 1880, and put into effect in 1886. Two years later, Brazil abolished slavery.

===Subsequent organization===

The roots of most Afro-Cuban musical forms lie in the cabildos, self-organized social clubs for the African slaves, separate cabildos for separate cultures. The cabildos were formed mainly from four groups: the Yoruba (the Lucumi in Cuba); the Congolese (Palo in Cuba); Dahomey (the Fon or Arará). Other cultures were undoubtedly present, more even than listed above, but in smaller numbers, and they did not leave such a distinctive presence.

Cabildos preserved African cultural traditions, even after the abolition of slavery in 1886. At the same time, African religions were transmitted from generation to generation throughout Cuba, Haiti, other islands and Brazil. These religions, which had a similar but not identical structure, were known as &quot;Lucumi&quot; or &quot;Regla de Ocha&quot; if they derived from the Yoruba, &quot;Palo&quot; from Central Africa, &quot;Vodú&quot; from Haiti, and so on. The term &quot;Santería&quot; was first introduced to account for the way African spirits were joined to Catholic saints, especially by people who were both baptized and initiated, and so were genuinely members of both groups. Outsiders picked up the word and have tended to use it somewhat indiscriminately. It has become a kind of catch-all word, rather like salsa in music.p171; p258

===African sacred music in Cuba===

All these African cultures had musical traditions, which survive erratically to the present day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In what other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa? They certainly are in Lucumí ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response) and dance in well-defined social settings, and the absence of melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind.

===Yoruba and Congolese rituals===

Religious traditions of African origin have survived in Cuba, and are the basis of ritual music, song and dance quite distinct from the secular music and dance. The religion of Yoruban origin is known as &quot;Lucumí&quot; or &quot;Regla de Ocha&quot;; the religion of Congolese origin is known as &quot;Palo&quot;, as in &quot;palos del monte&quot;. There are also, in the Oriente region, forms of Haitian ritual together with its own instruments, music etc.

===Clave===

The clave rhythmic pattern is used as a tool for temporal organization in Afro-Cuban music, such as rumba, conga de comparsa, son, mambo (music), salsa, Latin jazz, songo and timba. The five-stroke clave pattern (distributed in groups of 3 + 2 or 2 + 3 beats) represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms. Just as a keystone holds an arch in place, the clave pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music. The clave pattern originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions, where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba. The pattern is also found in the African diaspora musics of Haitian Vodou drumming and Afro-Brazilian music. The clave pattern is used in North American popular music as a rhythmic motif or ostinato, or simply a form of rhythmic decoration.

===Cuban Carnival===

In Cuba, the word &quot;comparsa&quot; refers to the &quot;Cabildos de Nación&quot; neighbourhood groups that took part in the carnival authorized by the Spanish government on the Three Kings Day (Día de Reyes) during the colonial period. Conga is of African origin, and derives from street celebrations of the African spirits. The distinction is blurred today, but in the past the congas have been prohibited from time to time. Carnival as a whole was banned by the revolutionary government for many years, and still does not take place with the regularity of old. Conga drums are played (along with other typical instruments) in comparsas of all kinds. Santiago de Cuba and Havana were the two main centers for street carnivals. Two types of dance music (at least) owe their origin to comparsa music:

Conga: an adaptation of comparsa music and dance for social dances. Eliseo Grenet may be the person who first created this music,p408 but it was the Lecuona Cuban Boys who took it around the world. The conga became, and perhaps still is, the best-known Cuban music and dance style for non-latins.

Mozambique is a comparsa-type dance music developed by &quot;Pello el Afrokan&quot; (Pedro Izquierdo) in 1963. It had a brief period of high popularity, peaked in 1965, and was soon forgotten. Apparently, to make it work properly, it needed 16 drums plus other percussion and dancers.

===Tumba francesa===

Immigrants from Haiti settled in Oriente and established their style of music, called Tumba Francesa, which uses its own type of drum, dance and song. It embodies one of the oldest and most tangible links to the Afro-Haitian heritage of Cuba&#x27;s Oriente province and developed from an 18th-century fusion of music from Dahomey in West Africa and traditional French dances. This fossil genre survives to the present day in Santiago de Cuba and Haiti, performed by specialized folk ensembles.

===The Black Curros (Negros Curros)===
In reference to the emergence of the Guaracha and, later, also of the Urban Rumba in Havana and Matanzas, an important and picturesque social sector was called Black Curros (Negros Curros). Composed of free blacks that had arrived from Seville on an undetermined date, this group was integrated to the population of free blacks and mulattos that lived in the marginal zones of the city of Havana.

José Victoriano Betancourt, a Cuban &quot;costumbrista&quot; writer from the 19th century, described them as follows: &quot;they [the curros] had a peculiar aspect, and was enough to look at them to recognize them as curros: their long hunks of kinky braids, falling over their face and neck like big millipedes, their teeth cut (sharp and pointed) to the carabalí style, their fine embroidered cloth shirts, their pants, almost always white, or with colored stripes, narrow at the waist and very wide in the legs; the canvas shoes, cut low with silver buckles, the short jacket with pointed tail, the exaggerated straw hat, with black hanging silk tassles, and the thick gold hoops that they wore in their ears, from which they hung harts and padlocks of the same metal, forming an ornament that only they wear; ... those were the curros of El Manglar (The mangrove neighborhood).&quot;

The curro was dedicated to laziness, theft and procuring, while his companion, the curra, also called &quot;mulata de rumbo&quot;, exercised the prostitution in Cuba. According to Carlos Noreña, she was well known for the use of burato shawls of meticulous work and plaited fringes, for which they used to pay from nine to ten ounces of gold&quot;, as well as by the typical clacking (chancleteo) they produced with their wooden slippers.

But the Curros also provided entertainment, including songs and dances to the thousands of Spanish men that came to the Island every year in the ships that followed the &quot;Carrera de Indias&quot;, a route established by the Spanish Crown for their galleons in order to avoid attacks from pirates and privateers, and stayed for months until they returned to the Port of Seville.

Being subject to the influence of both the Spanish and the African culture from birth, they are supposed to have played an important role in the creolization of the Spanish song-dances original proto-type (copla-estribillo) that originated the Cuban Guaracha. The Black curro and the Mulata de Rumbo (Black Curra) disappeared since the mid-19th century by integrating to the Havana general population, but their picturesque images survived in social prototypes manifested in the characters of the Bufo Theater.

The famous &quot;Mulatas de Rumbo&quot; (mulatto characters) Juana Chambicú and María La O, as well as the black &quot;cheches&quot; (bullies) José Caliente &quot;who rips in half those who oppose him,&quot; Candela, &quot;negrito that flies and cuts with the knife,&quot; as well as the Black Curro Juán Cocuyo, were strongly linked to the characteristic image of the Black Curro and to the ambiance of the Guaracha and the Rumba.

== Dances ==
===Contradanza===
The contradanza is an important precursor of several later popular dances. It arrived in Cuba in the late 18th century from Europe, where it had been developed first as the English country dance, and then as the French contradanse. The origin of the word is a corruption of the English term &quot;country dance&quot;. Manuel Saumell wrote over fifty contradanzas (in or time), in which his rhythmic and melodic inventiveness was astonishing.

The contradanza is a communal sequence dance, with the dance figures conforming to a set pattern. The selection of figures for a particular dance was usually set by a master of ceremonies or dance leader. There were two parts of 16 bars each, danced in a line or square format. The tempo and style of the music was bright and fairly fast.

The earliest Cuban creole composition of a contradanza appeared published in Havana in 1803 and was named &quot;San Pascual bailón&quot;. This version shows for the first time the well-known rhythm of &quot;tango&quot; or &quot;Habanera&quot; which differentiates it from the European contradance. The Cubans developed a number of creolized version, such as the &quot;paseo&quot;, &quot;cadena&quot;, &quot;sostenido&quot; and &quot;cedazo&quot;. This creolization is an early example of the influence of the African traditions in the Caribbean. Most of the musicians were black or mulatto (even early in the 19th century there were many freed slaves and mixed race persons living in Cuban towns). &quot;The women of Havana have a furious taste for dancing; they spend entire nights elevated, agitated, crazy and pouring sweat until they fall spent.&quot;
The contradanza supplanted the minuet as the most popular dance until 1842, when it gave way to the habanera, a quite different style.

===Danza===

This genere, the offspring of the contradanza, was also danced in lines or squares. It was also a brisk form of music and dance in double or triple time. A repeated 8-bar paseo was followed by two 16-bar sections called the primera and segunda. One famous composer of danzas was Ignacio Cervantes, whose forty-one danzas cubanas were a landmark in musical nationalism. This type of dance was eventually replaced by the danzón, which was, like the habanera, much slower and more sedate.

===Habanera===

The habanera developed out of the contradanza in the early 19th century. Its great novelty was that it was sung, as well as played and danced. Written in meter, the habanera is characterized by an expressive and languid melodious development and its characteristic rhythm called &quot;Habanera Rhythm.&quot;

The dance style of the habanera is slower and more stately than the danza. By the 1840s habaneras were written, sung, and danced in Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and Spain. Since about 1900 the habanera has been a relic dance; but the music has a period charm, and there are some famous compositions, such as &quot;Tú&quot; from Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes, which has been recorded in many versions.

Versions of habanera-type compositions have appeared in the music of Ravel, Bizet, Saint-Saëns, Debussy, Fauré, and Albeniz. The rhythm is similar to that of the tango, and some believe the habanera is the musical father of the tango.

===Danzón===


The European influence on Cuba&#x27;s later musical development is represented by danzón, an elegant musical form that was once more popular than the Son in Cuba. It is a descendant of the creolized Cuban contradanza. The danzón marks the change from the communal sequence dance style of the late 18th century to the couple dances of later times. The stimulus for this was the success of the once-scandalous walz, where couples danced facing each other, independently from other couples and not as part of a pre-set structure. The danzón was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though there is a difference between the two dances. The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti-clockwise direction; the danzón is a &#x27;pocket-handkerchief&#x27; dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor.

The danzón was developed by Miguel Faílde in Matanzas, the official date of origin being 1879. Failde&#x27;s was an orquesta típica, a form derived from military bands, using brass, kettle-drums etc. The later development of the charanga was more suited to the indoor salon and is an orchestral format still popular today in Cuba and some other countries. The charanga uses double bass, cello, violins, flute, piano, paila criolla and güiro. This change in instrumental set-up is illustrated in Early Cuban bands.
From time to time in its &#x27;career&#x27;, the danzón acquired African influences in its musical structure. It became more syncopated, especially in its third part. The credit for this is given to José Urfé, who worked elements of the son into the last part of the danzón in his composition &quot;El bombin de Barreto&quot; (1910). Both the danzón and the charanga line-up have been strongly influential in later developments.

The danzón was exported to popular acclaim throughout Latin America, especially Mexico. It is now a relic, both in music and in dance, but its highly orchestrated descendants live on in charangas that Faílde and Urfé would likely not recognize. Juan Formell has had a huge influence through his reorganization of first Orquesta Revé, and later Los Van Van.

===Danzonete===

Early danzóns were purely instrumental. The first to introduce a vocal part in a danzón was Aniceto Díaz (in 1927 in Matanzas), that was called &quot;Rompiendo la rutina&quot;, thereby creating a new genre called the danzonete. Later, the black singer Barbarito Diez joined the charanga of Antonio María Romeu in 1935 and, over the years, recorded eleven albums of danzonetes. All later forms of the danzón have included vocals.

==Musical theatre==


From the 18th century (at least) to modern times, popular theatrical formats used, and gave rise to, music and dance. Many famous composers and musicians had their careers launched in the theatres, and many famous compositions got their first airing on the stage. In addition to staging some European operas and operettas, Cuban composers gradually developed ideas that better suited their audience. Recorded music was to be the couduit for Cuban music to reach the world. The most recorded artist in Cuba up to 1925 was a singer at the &quot;Alhambra&quot;, Adolfo Colombo. Records show he recorded about 350 numbers between 1906 and 1917.

The first theatre in Havana opened in 1776. The first Cuban-composed opera appeared in 1807. Theatrical music was hugely important in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century; its significance only began to wane with the change in political and social weather in the second part of the 20th century. Radio, which began in Cuba in 1922, helped the growth of popular music because it provided publicity and a new source of income for the artists.

===Zarzuela===

Zarzuela is a small-scale light operetta format. Starting off with imported Spanish content (List of zarzuela composers), it developed into a running commentary on Cuba&#x27;s social and political events and problems. Zarzuela has the distinction of providing Cuba&#x27;s first recordings: the soprano Chalía Herrera (1864–1968) made, outside Cuba, the first recordings by a Cuban artist. She recorded numbers from the zarzuela &quot;Cádiz&quot; in 1898 on unnumbered Bettini cylinders.

Zarzuela reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century. A string of front-rank composers such as Gonzalo Roig, Eliseo Grenet, Ernesto Lecuona and Rodrigo Prats produced a series of hits for the &quot;Regina&quot; and &quot;Martí&quot; theatres in Havana. Great stars like the &quot;vedette&quot; Rita Montaner, who could sing, play the piano, dance and act, were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris. Some of the best known zarzuelas are &quot;La virgen morena&quot; (Grenet), &quot;La Niña Rita&quot; (Grenet and Lecuona), &quot;María la O&quot;, &quot;El batey&quot;, &quot;Rosa la China&quot; (all Lecuona); Gonzalo Roig with &quot;La Habana de noche&quot;; Rodrigo Prats with &quot;Amalia Batista&quot; and &quot;La perla del caribe&quot;; and above all, &quot;Cecilia Valdés&quot; (the musical of the most famous Cuban novel of the 19th century, with music by Roig and script by Prats and Agustín Rodríguez). Artists who were introduced to the public in the lyric theatre include Caridad Suarez, María de los Angeles Santana, Esther Borja and Ignacio Villa, who had such a round, black face that Rita Montaner called him Bola de Nieve (&#x27;Snowball&#x27;).

Another famous singer was Maruja González Linares. Born from Spanish parents in the Mexican locality of Mérida, Yucatán in 1904, González travelled from Cuba to the US at a very young age. She studied vocal techniques in Cuba, where she made her debut in 1929 as a lyrical singer in the Company of Maestro Ernesto Lecuona. González performed in several theaters of Havana before going on a tour through the United States and, upon her return to Havana, she sang &quot;La Bayadere&quot; and &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; in the same city. At the beginning of the 1930s, she signed a number of contracts in Latin America and in Spain. She married Perico Suarez. The Cuban Revolution caught her abroad and she never returned to her country. She died in Miami in 1999.

===Bufo theatre===

Cuban &quot;bufo theatre&quot; is a form of comedy, ribald and satirical, with stock figures imitating types that might be found anywhere in the country. Bufo had its origin around 1800-15 as an older form, &quot;tonadilla&quot;, began to vanish from Havana. Francisco Covarrubias the &#x27;caricaturist&#x27; (1775–1850) was its creator. Gradually, the comic types threw off their European models and became more and more creolized and Cuban. Alongside, the music followed. Argot from slave barracks and poor barrios found its way into lyrics that are those of the guaracha:

::Una mulata me ha muerto!
::Y no prenden a esa mulata?
::Como ha de quedar hombre vivo
::si no prenden a quien mata!

::La mulata es como el pan;
::se debe comer caliente,
::que en dejandola enfriar
::ni el diablo le mete el diente!p218

::(A mulata&#x27;s done for me!
::What&#x27;s more, they don&#x27;t arrest her!
::How can any man live
::If they don&#x27;t take this killer?

::A mulatta is like fresh bread
::You gotta eat it while it&#x27;s hot
::If you leave it till it&#x27;s cool
::Even the devil can&#x27;t get a bite!)

The &quot;guaracha&quot; occupied a predominant place within the development of vernacular theater in Cuba, which appearance at the beginning of the 19th century coincides with the emergence of the first autochthonous Cuban musical genres, the &quot;guaracha&quot; and the&quot;contradanza.&quot;. Since 1812, Francisco Covarrubias (considered as the father of the Bufo Theater) gradually substituted in his theatrical pieces the typical characters of the Spanish &quot;tonadilla escénica&quot; with creole characters such as &quot;guajiros&quot;, &quot;monteros&quot;, &quot;carreteros&quot; or &quot;peones&quot;. Those structural transformations were also associated to certain changes in the musical background of the pieces. Thus, the Spanish genres such as &quot;jácaras&quot;, &quot;tiranas&quot;, &quot;boleras&quot; or &quot;villancicos&quot;, were substituted by &quot;guarachas&quot;, &quot;décimas&quot; and &quot;canciones cubanas.&quot;

===Other theatrical forms===

Vernacular theatre of various types often includes music. Formats rather like the British Music Hall, or the American Vaudeville, still occur, where an audience is treated to a potpourri of singers, comedians, bands, sketches and speciality acts. Even in cinemas during the silent movies, singers and instrumentalists appeared in the interval, and a pianist played during the films. Bola de Nieve and María Teresa Vera played in cinemas in their early days. Burlesque was also common in Havana before 1960.

==Rumba and guaracha==

The word &quot;rumba&quot; is an abstract term that has been applied with different purposes to a wide variety of subjects for a very long time. From a semantic point of view, the term &quot;rumba&quot; is included in a group of words with similar meaning such as conga, milonga, bomba, tumba, samba, bamba, mambo, tambo, tango, cumbé, cumbia and candombe. All of them denote a Congolese origin due to the utilization of sound combinations such as, mb, ng and nd, that are typical of the Niger-Congo linguistic complex.

Maybe the most ancient and general of its meanings is that of a feast or &quot;holgorio&quot;. As far as the second half of the 19th century, this word can be found used several times to represent a feast in a short story called &quot;La mulata de rumbo&quot;, from the Cuban folklorist Francisco de Paula Gelabert: &quot;I have more enjoyment and fun in a rumbita with those of my color and class&quot;, or &quot;Leocadia was going to bed, as I was telling you, nothing less than at twelve noon, when one of his friends from the rumbas arrived, along with another young man that he wanted to introduce to her.&quot; According to Alejo Carpentier, &quot;it is significant that the word rumba have passed to the Cuban language as a synonym of holgorio, lewd dance, merrymaking with low class women (mujeres del rumbo).&quot;

As an example, In the case of the Yuka, Makuta and Changüí feasts in Cuba, as well as the Milonga and the Tango in Argentina, the word rumba was originally utilized to nominate a festive gathering; and after some time it was used to name the musical and dance genres that were played at those gatherings.

Among many others, some utilizations of the term &quot;rumba&quot; include a cover-all term for faster Cuban music which started in the early 1930s with &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot;. This term was replaced during the 1970s by salsa, which is also a cover-all term for marketing the Cuban music and other Hispano-Caribbean genres to non-Cubans. In the international Latin-American dance syllabus rumba is a misnomer for the slow Cuban rhythm more accurately called bolero-son.

Some scholars have pointed out that in reference to the utilization of the terms rumba and guaracha, there is possibly a case of synonymy, or the use of two different words to denominate the same thing. According to María Teresa Linares: &quot;during the first years of the 20th century, there were used at the end of the vernacular (Bufo) theater plays some musical fragments that the authors sang, and that were called closing rumba (rumba final)&quot; and she continues explaining that those (rumbas) &quot;were certainly guarachas.&quot; The musical pieces used to close those plays may have been indistinctly called rumbas or guarachas, because those terms did not denote any generic or structural difference between them. Linares also said in reference to this subject: &quot;Some recordings of guarachas and rumbas have been preserved that do not differentiate between them in the guitar parts – when it was a small group, duo or trio, or by the theater orchestra or a piano. The labels of the recordings stated: dialogue and rumba (diálogo y rumba).&quot;

===Urban rumba===


Urban rumba (also called Rumba (de solar o de cajón)) is an amalgamation of several African drumming and dance traditions, combined with Spanish influences. According to Cuban musicologist Argeliers León: &quot;In the feast that constituted a rumba concurred, therefore, determined African contributions, but also converged other elements from Hispanic roots, that were already incorporated to the expressions that appeared in the new population emerging in the Island.&quot; 
Rumba (de solar o de cajón) is a secular musical style from the docks and the less prosperous areas of Havana and Matanzas. At the beginning, rumba musicians used a trio of wooden boxes (cajones) to play, that were substituted later by drums, similar in appearance to conga drums. The treble drum is called &quot;quinto&quot;, the midrange drum is called &quot;macho or tres-dos&quot; (three-two), because its essential rhythm is based on the Cuban clave pattern, and the bass drum is called &quot;hembra o salidor,&quot; because it usually began or &quot;broke in&quot; (rompía) the rumba. In the rumba ensemble they also utilize two sticks or spoons to beat over a hollow piece of bamboo called &quot;guagua&quot; or &quot;catá,&quot; as well as the Cuban claves, the Güiro and some rattles of bantu origin called &quot;nkembi&quot;.

The vocal part of the rumba corresponds to a modified version of the ancient Spanish style of &quot;copla-estribillo&quot; (quatrain-refrain), including a &quot;montuno&quot; section that one may consider an expanded or developed &quot;refrain&quot; that constitute an independent section which include the call and response style, so typical of the African traditions.
From the many rumba styles that began to appear during the end of the 19th century called &quot;Spanish times&quot; (Tiempo&#x27;españa), such as tahona, jiribilla, palatino and resedá, three basic rumba forms have survived: the Columbia, the guaguancó and the yambú. The Columbia, played in time, is often as a solo dance performed only by a male performer. It is fast and includes aggressive and acrobatic moves. The guaguancó is danced by a pair of one man and one woman. The dance simulates the man&#x27;s pursuit of the woman. The yambú, now a relic, featured a burlesque imitation of an old man walking with a stick. All forms of rumba are accompanied by song or chants.

Rumba (de solar o de cajón) is today a fossil genre usually seen in Cuba in performances of professional groups. There are also amateur groups based on &quot;Casas de Cultura&quot; (Culture Centers), and on work groups. Like all aspects of life in Cuba, dance and music are organised by the state through Ministries and their various committees.

===Coros de Clave===

Coros de Clave were popular choral groups that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century in Havana and other Cuban cities.

The Cuban government only allowed black people, slaves or free, to cultivate their cultural traditions within the boundaries of certain mutual aid societies, which were founded during the 16th century. According to David H. Brown, those societies, called Cabildos, &quot;provided in times of sickness and death, held masses for deceased members, collected funds to buy nation-brethren out of slavery, held regular dances and diversions on Sundays and feast days, and sponsored religious masses, processions and dancing carnival groups (now called comparsas) around the annual cycle of Catholic festival days.&quot;

Within the Cabildos of certain neighborhoods from Havana, Matanzas, Sancti Spíritus and Trinidad, some choral groups were founded during the 19th century that organized competitive activities, and in some occasions were visited by local authorities and neighbors that gave them money and presents. Those choral societies were called Coros de Clave, probably after the instrument that used to accompany their performances, the Cuban Claves.

The accompaniment of the choirs also included a guitar and the percussion was executed over the sound box of an American banjo from which the strings were removed, due to the fact that African drums performance was strictly forbidden in Cuban cities. The style of the Coros de Clave music, and particularly its rhythm, originated later a popular song genre called Clave, which most probable served as the original prototype for the creation of the Criolla genre. Both genres, the Clave and the Criolla, became very popular within the Cuban vernacular theater repertoire.

===Rural rumba===

In a similar way as the first Spanish song-dances spread from the cities to the countryside, also the characteristics of the Cuban Guaracha, that enjoyed great popularity in Havana, began to spread to the rural areas in an undetermined time during the 19th century. This process was not difficult if one considers how close to one another the urban and the rural areas in Cuba were at that time. That was why the Cuban peasants (guajiros) began to include in their parties called &quot;guateques&quot; or &quot;changüís&quot;, and in feasts such as the &quot;fiestas patronales&quot; (patron saint celebrations) and the &quot;parrandas&quot;, some rumbitas (little rumbas) that were very similar to the urban Guarachas, which binary meter contrasted with the ternary beat of their traditional &quot;tonadas&quot; and &quot;zapateos&quot;.

Those little rural rumbas have been called by renowned musicologist Danilo Orozco &quot;proto-sones&quot;, &quot;soncitos primigenios&quot;, &quot;rumbitas&quot;, &quot;nengones&quot; or &quot;marchitas,&quot; and some of them—such as Caringa, Papalote, Doña Joaquina, Anda Pepe and the Tingotalango—have been preserved until the present time.

The rumbitas were considered proto-sones (primeval Sones), because of the evident analogy that their structural components show with the Son, which emerged in Havana during the first decades of the 20th century. The rumbitas may be considered the original prototype of this popular genre.

According to musicologist Virtudes Feliú, those rumbitas appeared in cities and towns throughout the entire territory of the Island, such as: Ciego de Ávila, Sancti Espíritus, Cienfuegos, Camagüey, Puerta de Golpe in Pinar del Río and Bejucal in Havana, as well as Remedios in Villa Clara and Isla de Pinos (Pines Island).

There are many references to the Cuban Independence Wars (1868–1898), related to the rural rumbitas, in the Eastern region of the country as well as in the Western region and Isla de Pinos, which suggest that their emergence took place approximately during the second half of the 19th century.

The rural rumbitas included a greater number of African characteristics than the Cuban Guaracha, due to the gradual integration of free Afro-Cuban citizens to the rural environment.

Since the 16th century, thanks to a government-approved program called &quot;manumisión&quot;, the black slaves were allowed to pay for their freedom with their own savings. Therefore, a larger number of free blacks were dedicated to the manual labors in the fields than in the cities, and some of them were also able to become proprietaries of land and slaves.

====Characteristics of the rural rumba====
One of the most salient characteristics of the rural rumbitas was its own form, very similar to the African typical song structure. In this case, the entire piece was based on a single musical fragment or phrase of short duration that was repeated, with some variations, time and time again, often alternating with a choir. This style was called &quot;montuno&quot; (literally &quot;from the countryside&quot;) due to its rural origin.
Another characteristic of the new genre was the superposition of different rhythmic patterns simultaneously executed, similar to the way it is utilized in the Urban Rumba, which is also a common trait of the African musical tradition. Those layers or &quot;franjas de sonoridades&quot;, according to Argeliers León, were assigned to different instruments that were gradually incorporated into the group. Therefore, the ensemble grew from the traditional Tiple and Güiro, to one that included guitar, &quot;bandurria&quot;, Cuban lute, claves, and other instruments such as the &quot;tumbandera&quot;, the &quot;marímbula&quot;, the &quot;botija&quot;, the bongoes, the common &quot;machete&quot; (cutlass) and the accordion.

Some important musical functions were assigned to the sonority layers, such as the &quot;time line&quot; or clave rhythm performed by the claves, a &quot;1 eighth note + 2 sixteenth notes&quot; rhythm played by the güiro or the machete, the patterns of the &quot;guajeo&quot; by the tres, the improvisation on the bongoes and the anticipated bass on the &quot;tumbandera&quot; or the &quot;botija&quot;.

===Guaracha===


On January 20, 1801, Buenaventura Pascual Ferrer published a note in a newspaper called &quot;El Regañón de La Habana&quot;, in which he refers to certain chants that &quot;run outside there through vulgar voices&quot;. Between them he mentioned a &quot;guaracha&quot; named &quot;La Guabina&quot;, about which he says: &quot;in the voice of those that sings it, tastes like any thing dirty, indecent or disgusting that you can think about.&quot; At a later undetermined date, &quot;La Guabina&quot; appears published between the first musical scores printed in Havana at the beginning of the 19th century.

From the commentaries published in &quot;El Regañón de La Habana&quot;, it can be concluded that those &quot;guarachas&quot; were very popular within the Havana population at that time, because in the same previously mentioned article the author says: &quot;but most importantly, what bothers me most is the liberty with which a number of chants are sung throughout the streets and town homes, where innocence is insulted and morals offended ... by many individuals, not just of the lowest class, but also by some people that are supposed to be called well educated.&quot; Therefore, it can be said that those audacious &quot;guarachas&quot; were apparently already sung within a wide social sector of the Havana population.

According to Alejo Carpentier (quoting Buenaventura Pascual Ferrer), at the beginning of the 19th century there were held in Havana up to fifty dance parties every day, where the famous &quot;guaracha&quot; was sung and danced, among other popular pieces.

The guaracha is a genre of rapid tempo and comic or picaresque lyrics. It originated at the end of the 18th century, and during the early 20th century was still often played in the brothels and other places in Havana. The lyrics were full of slang, and dwelt on events and people in the news. Rhythmically, guaracha exhibits a series of rhythm combinations, such as with .

Many of the early trovadores, such as Manuel Corona (who worked in a brothel area of Havana), composed and sang guarachas as a balance for the slower boleros and canciones. The satirical lyric content also fitted well with the son, and many bands played both genres. In the mid-20th century the style was taken up by the conjuntos and big bands as a type of up-tempo music. Today it seems no longer to exist as a distinct musical form; it has been absorbed into the vast maw of salsa. Singers who can handle the fast lyrics and are good improvisors are called &quot;guaracheros&quot; or &quot;guaracheras&quot;.

===Proto-son===

The origin of the Cuban son can be traced to the rural rumbas, called proto-sones (primeval sones) by musicologist Danilo Orozco. They show, in a partial or embryonic form, all the characteristics that later would identify the son style: The repetition of a phrase called &quot;montuno&quot;, the clave pattern, a rhythmic counterpoint between different layers of the musical texture, the &quot;guajeo&quot; from the Tres, the rhythms from the guitar, the bongoes and the double bass and the call-and-response style between soloist and choir.
According to Radamés Giro, later the refrain (estribillo) or &quot;montuno&quot; was tied to a quatrain (cuarteta – copla) called &quot;regina&quot;, which was how the peasants from the Eastern side of the country called the quatrain. In this way, the structure &quot;refrain–quatrain–refrain&quot; appears at a very early stage in the &quot;Son Oriental&quot;, like in one of the most ancient Sones called &quot;Son de Máquina&quot; (Machine Son), which comprises three &quot;reginas&quot; with its correspondent refrains.

During an investigative project about the Valera-Miranda family (old Soneros) conducted by Danilo Orozco in the region of Guantánamo, he recorded a sample of Nengón, which is considered an ancestor of the Changüí. It shows the previously mentioned &quot;refrain–quatrain–refrain&quot; structure. In this case, the several repetitions of the refrain constitute a true &quot;montuno&quot;.

Refrain: Yo he nacido para ti nengón, yo he nacido para ti nengón, yo he nacido para ti Nengón... (I was born for you Nengón...)

====Nengón====

The &quot;Nengón&quot; is considered a Proto-Son, precursor of the Changüí and also of the Oriental Son. Its main characteristic is the alternance of improvised verses between a soloist and a choir. The Nengón is played with Tres, Guitar, Güiro and Tingotalango or Tumbandera.

====Changüí====

Changüí is a type of son from the eastern provinces (area of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo), formerly known as Oriente. It shares relevant characteristics with the Oriental Son in regard to rhythms, instruments and choral refrains; and at the same time it shows certain original elements.

Changüí exists today in the form of dozens of small groups, mostly from Guantanamo province. The instrumentation is similar to that of the early Son groups who set up in Havana before 1920. These son groups, for example, the early Sexteto Boloña and Sexteto Habanero, used either marimbulas or botijas as bass instruments before they changed over to the double bass, musically a more flexible instrument.

Changui is a genuinely distinctive music and culture practiced by residents of the Guantanamo province with its own distinctive social dance form (couple dance). Guantanameros engage in Changui in house parties (called Peñas), street parties, concerts at venues such as Casa de Changui, a weekly Monday night dance broadcast live on Radio Guantanamo, an annual Changui festival to celebrate the anniversary of Chito Latanble, and the bi-annual Festival de Changui. There is often a Changui function on most nights of the week at the Province.

Some modern orchestras, such as Orquesta Revé, have claimed Changüí as their main influence. Whether this is accurate, or not, is unclear.

====Sucu-Sucu====

We can also find in Isla de Pinos, at the opposite Western side of the Island a primeval Proto-Son called Sucu-Sucu, which also shows the same structure of the Oriental Proto-Sones. According to Maria Teresa Linares, In the Sucu-Sucu the music is similar to a Son Montuno in its formal, melodic, instrumental and harmonic structure. A soloist alternates with a choir and improvises on a quatrain or a &quot;décima.&quot; The instrumental section is introduced by the Tres, gradually joined by the other instruments. The introduction of eight measures is followed by the refrain by the choir that alternates with the soloist several times.

An urban legend claims that the name &quot;Sucu Sucu&quot; came from the grandmother of one of the local musicians in la Isla de Juventud. The band was playing in the patio, and the dances were dancing while shuffling their feet on the sandy floor. The grandmother came out of the house to say &quot;Please stop making noise with all that sucu sucu,&quot; referring to the sound of shuffling feet on a sandy floor. The legend claim that the name stuck, and the music the dancers were dancing too started to be named &quot;Sucu Sucu&quot;.

===Trova===

In the 19th century, Santiago de Cuba became the focal point of a group of itinerant musicians, troubadours, who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar. They were of great importance as composers, and their songs have been transcribed for all genres of Cuban music

Pepe Sánchez, born José Sánchez (1856–1918), is known as the father of the &quot;trova&quot; style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. He had no formal training in music. With remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them. His first bolero, &quot;Tristezas&quot;, is still remembered today. He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him.
The first, and one of the longest-lived, was Sindo Garay (1867–1968). He was an outstanding composer of trova songs, and his best have been sung and recorded many times. Garay was also musically illiterate – in fact, he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 – but in his case not only were scores recorded by others, but there are recordings. Garay settled in Havana in 1906, and in 1926 joined Rita Montaner and others to visit Paris, spending three months there. He broadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. He used to say &quot;Not many men have shaken hands with both José Martí and Fidel Castro!&quot;p298

José &#x27;Chicho&#x27; Ibáñez (1875–1981) was even longer-lived than Garay. Ibáñez was the first trovador to specialize in the son; he also sang guaguancós and pieces from the abakuá.

The composer Rosendo Ruiz (1885–1983) was another long-lived trovador. He was the author of a well-known guitar manual. Alberto Villalón (1882–1955), and Manuel Corona (1880–1950) were of similar stature. Garay, Ruiz, Villalón and Corona are known as &quot;the four greats of the trova&quot;, though the following trovadores are also highly regarded.

Patricio Ballagas (1879–1920); María Teresa Vera (1895–1965), Lorenzo Hierrezuelo (1907–1993), Ñico Saquito (Antonio Fernandez: 1901–1982), Carlos Puebla (1917–1989) and Compay Segundo (Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz: 1907–2003) were all great trova musicians. El Guayabero (Faustino Oramas: 1911–2007) was the last of the old trova.

Trova musicians often worked in pairs and trios, some of them exclusively so (Compay Segundo). As the sexteto/septeto/conjunto genre grew many of them joined in the larger groups. And let&#x27;s not forget the Trio Matamoros, who worked together for most of their lives. Matamoros was one of the greats.

====Bolero====

This is a song and dance form quite different from its Spanish namesake. It originated in the last quarter of the 19th century with the founder of the traditional trova, Pepe Sánchez. He wrote the first bolero, &quot;Tristezas&quot;, which is still sung today. The bolero has always been a staple of the trova musician&#x27;s repertoire.
Originally, there were two sections of 16 bars in time separated by an instrumental section on the Spanish guitar called the &quot;pasacalle&quot;. The bolero proved to be exceptionally adaptable, and led to many variants. Typical was the introduction of syncopation, leading to the bolero-moruno, bolero-beguine, bolero-mambo, and bolero-cha. The bolero-son became for several decades the most popular rhythm for dancing in Cuba, and it was this rhythm that the international dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly named &#x27;rumba&#x27;.

The Cuban bolero was exported all over the world, and is still popular. Leading composers of the bolero were Sindo Garay, Rosendo Ruiz, Carlos Puebla, and Agustín Lara (Mexico).

====Canción====

&quot;Canción&quot; means &#x27;song&#x27; in Spanish. It is a popular genre of Latin American music, particularly in Cuba, where many of the compositions originate. Its roots lie in Spanish, French and Italian popular song forms. Originally highly stylized, with &quot;intricate melodies and dark, enigmatic and elaborate lyrics&quot; The canción was democratized by the trova movement in the latter part of the 19th century, when it became a vehicle for the aspirations and feelings of the population. Canción gradually fused with other forms of Cuban music, such as the bolero.

===Tropical waltz===

The waltz (&quot;El vals&quot;) arrived in Cuba by 1814. It was the first dance in which couples were not linked by a communal sequence pattern. It was, and still is, danced in time with the accent on the first beat. It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other, held each other in the &#x27;closed&#x27; hold, and, so to speak, ignored the surrounding community. The waltz entered all countries in the Americas; its relative popularity in 19th-century Cuba is hard to estimate.

Indigenous Cuban dances did not use the closed hold with couples dancing independently until the danzón later in the century, though the guaracha might be an earlier example. The waltz has another characteristic: it is a &#x27;travelling&#x27; dance, with couples moving round the arena. In Latin dances, progressive movement of dancers is unusual, but does occur in the conga, the samba and the tango.

The &quot;Tropical waltz&quot; was performed in a slower tempo and frequently included a sung melody with a text. Those texts usually referred to the beauties of the Cuban countryside, the longing of the Siboneyes (Cuban aboriginee) and other creole themes. With accents on its three beats, its melody was fluid and composed of equal value notes. It was similar to many other songs in which the melody was treated in a syllabic way, where the first beat was not stressed by a brief anacrusis but had a tendency to move toward the second beat like in the peasant (guajiro) song.

===Son===


Son cubano is a style of music and dance that originated in Cuba and gained worldwide popularity during the 1930s. Son combines the structure and traits of the Spanish canción with Afro-Cuban stylistic and percussion instruments elements. The Cuban Son is one of the most influential and widespread forms of Latin American music: its derivatives and fusions, especially salsa, have spread across the world.

The Son, said Cristóbal Díaz, is the most important genre of Cuban music, and the least studied. It can fairly be said that son is to Cuba what the tango is to Argentina, or the samba to Brazil. In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-American music. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions. Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban instrument known as the &quot;tres&quot;, and the well-known double-headed bongó; these are present from the start to the present day. Also typical are the claves, the Spanish guitar, the double bass (replacing the early botija or marímbula), early on the cornet or trumpet and finally the piano.

In spite of a traditional tendency to attribute the origin of Cuban Son to the Eastern region of Cuba (Oriente), most recently, some musicologists have shown a more inclusive stance. Although Alejo Carpentier, Emilio Grenet and Cristóbal Díaz Ayala support the &quot;Eastern origin&quot; theory, Argeliers León does not mention anything about it in his pivotal work &quot;Del Canto y el Tiempo&quot;, as well as María Teresa Linares in &quot;The Music between Cuba and Spain.&quot; Ramadamés Giro states about this subject: &quot;If Son was an artistic phenomenon that was developing since the second half of the 19th century – and not just in the old Oriente (Eastern) province -, it is logical to suppose, but not to affirm, that long before 1909 it was heard in the Capital City (Havana) because of the aforementioned reasons.&quot;

It was in Havana where the encounter of the rural rumba and the urban rumba, that had been developing separately during the second half of the 19th century, took place. The guaracheros and rumberos that used to play with the Tiple and the Guiro finally met other Rumberos that sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (cajón) and the Cuban Clave, and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called Son. Around 1910 the Son most likely adopted the clave rhythm from the Havana-based rumba, which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and Matanzas.

The mass popularization of Son music led to an increased valorization of Afro-Cuban street culture and of the artists who created it. It also opened the door for other music genres with Afro-Cuban roots to become popular in Cuba and throughout the world.

==20th- and 21st-century popular music==
===Cuban jazz===

The history of jazz in Cuba was obscured for many years, but it has become clear that its history in Cuba is virtually as long as its history in the US.

Much more is now known about early Cuban jazz bands, but a full assessment is plagued by the lack of recordings. Migrations and visits to and from the US and the mutual exchange of recordings and sheet music kept musicians in the two countries in touch. In the first part of the 20th century, there were close relations between musicians in Cuba and those in New Orleans. The orchestra leader in the famous Tropicana Club, Armando Romeu Jr, was a leading figure in the post–World War II development of Cuban jazz. The phenomenon of cubop and the jam sessions in Havana and New York organized by Cachao created genuine fusions that influence musicians today.

A key historian of early Cuban jazz is Leonardo Acosta. Others have explored the history of jazz and Latin jazz more from the U.S. perspective.

====Early Cuban jazz bands====
The Jazz Band Sagua was founded in Sagua la Grande in 1914 by Pedro Stacholy (director &amp; piano). Members: Hipólito Herrera (trumpet); Norberto Fabelo (cornet); Ernesto Ribalta (flute &amp; sax); Humberto Domínguez (violin); Luciano Galindo (trombone); Antonio Temprano (tuba); Tomás Medina (drum kit); Marino Rojo (güiro). For fourteen years they played at the Teatro Principal de Sagua. Stacholy studied under Antonio Fabré in Sagua, and completed his studies in New York, where he stayed for three years.

The Cuban Jazz Band was founded in 1922 by Jaime Prats in Havana. The personnel included his son Rodrigo Prats on violin, the great flautist Alberto Socarrás on flute and saxophone and Pucho Jiménez on slide trombone. The line-up would probably have included double bass, kit drum, banjo, cornet at least. Earlier works cited this as the first jazz band in Cuba, but evidently there were earlier groups.

In 1924 Moisés Simons (piano) founded a group which played on the roof garden of the Plaza Hotel in Havana, and consisted of piano, violin, two saxes, banjo, double bass, drums and timbales. Its members included Virgilio Diago (violin); Alberto Soccarás (alto saz, flute); José Ramón Betancourt (tenor sax); Pablo O&#x27;Farrill (d. bass). In 1928, still at the same venue, Simons hired Julio Cueva, a famous trumpeter, and Enrique Santiesteban, a future media star, as vocalist and drummer. These were top instrumentalists, attracted by top fees of $8 a day.p28

During the 1930s, several bands played Jazz in Havana, such as those of Armando Romeu, Isidro Pérez, Chico O&#x27;Farrill and Germán Lebatard. Their most important contribution was its own instrumental format itself, which introduced the typical Jazz sonority to the Cuban audience. Another important element within this process were the arrangements of Cuban musicians such as Romeu, O&#x27;Farrill, Bebo Valdés, Peruchín Jústiz and Leopoldo &quot;Pucho&quot; Escalante.

===Afro-Cuban jazz===


Afro-Cuban jazz is the earliest form of Latin jazz and mixes Afro-Cuban clave-based rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation. Afro-Cuban jazz first emerged in the early 1940s, with the Cuban musicians Mario Bauza and Frank Grillo &quot;Machito&quot; in the band Machito and his Afro-Cubans, based in New York City. In 1947 the collaborations of bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, most notably the tumbadora and the bongo, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as Dizzy&#x27;s and Pozo&#x27;s &quot;Manteca&quot; and Charlie Parker&#x27;s and Machito&#x27;s &quot;Mangó Mangüé&quot;, were commonly referred to as &quot;Cubop&quot;, short for Cuban bebop. During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba itself. In the early 1970s, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna and later Irakere brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing new styles such as songo.

===Diversification and popularization===

====Cuban music enters the United States====

In 1930, Don Azpiazú had the first million-selling record of Cuban music: &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot; (El Manisero), with Antonio Machín as the singer. This number had been orchestrated and included in N.Y. theatre by Azpiazú before recording, which no doubt helped with the publicity. The Lecuona Cuban Boys became the best-known Cuban touring ensemble: they were the ones who first used the conga drum in their conjunto, and popularized the conga as a dance. Xavier Cugat at the Waldorf Astoria was highly influential. In 1941 Desi Arnaz popularized the comparsa drum (similar to the conga) in the U.S with his performances of Babalú. There was a real &#x27;rumba craze&#x27; at the time. Later, Mario Bauza and Machito set up in New York and Miguelito Valdés also arrived there.

=== 1940s and &#x27;50s ===
In the 1940s, Chano Pozo formed part of the bebop revolution in jazz, playing conga with Dizzy Gillespie and Machito in New York City. Cuban jazz had started much earlier, in Havana, in the period 1910–1930.
Arsenio Rodríguez, one of Cuba&#x27;s most famous tres players and conjunto leaders, emphasised the &quot;son&quot; African roots by adapting the &quot;guaguancó&quot; style, and by adding a cowbell and conga to the rhythm section. He also expanded the role of the tres as a solo instrument.

In the late 1930s and &#x27;40s, the danzonera Arcaño y sus Maravillas incorporated more syncopation and added a montuno (as in son), transforming the music played by charanga orchestras.

==== The big band era ====

The big band era arrived in Cuba in the 1940s, and became a dominant format that survives. Two great arranger-bandleaders deserve special credit for this, Armando Romeu Jr. and Damaso Perez Prado. Armando Romeu Jr. led the Tropicana Cabaret orchestra for 25 years, starting in 1941. He had experience playing with visiting American jazz groups as well as a mastery of Cuban forms of music. In his hands the Tropicana presented not only Afrocuban and other popular Cuban music, but also Cuban jazz and American big band compositions. Later he conducted the Orquesta Cubana de Musica Moderna.

Damaso Perez Prado had a number of hits, and sold more 78s than any other Latin music of the day. He took over the role of pianist/arranger for the Orquesta Casino de la Playa in 1944, and immediately began introducing new elements into its sound. The orchestra began to sound more Afrocuban, and at the same time Prado took influences from Stravinsky, Stan Kenton and elsewhere. By the time he left the orchestra in 1946 he had put together the elements of his big band mambo.: &quot;Above all, we must point out the work of Perez Prado as an arranger, or better yet, composer and arranger, and his clear influence on most other Cuban arrangers from then on.&quot;p86

Benny Moré, considered by many the greatest Cuban singer of all time, was in his heyday in the 1950s. He had an innate musicality and fluid tenor voice, which he colored and phrased with great expressivity. Although he could not read music, Moré was a master of all the genres, including son montuno, mambo, guaracha, guajira, cha cha cha, afro, canción, guaguancó, and bolero. His orchestra, the Banda Gigante, and his music, was a development – more flexible and fluid in style – of the Perez Prado orchestra, which he sang with in 1949–1950.

====Cuban music in the US====
Three great innovations based on Cuban music hit the US after World War II: the first was Cubop, the latest Latin jazz fusion. In this, Mario Bauza and the Machito orchestra on the Cuban side and Dizzy Gillespie on the American side were prime movers. The rumbustious conguero Chano Pozo was also important, for he introduced jazz musicians to basic Cuban rhythms. Cuban jazz has continued to be a significant influence.

The mambo first entered the United States around 1950, though ideas had been developing in Cuba and Mexico City for some time. The mambo as understood in the United States and Europe was considerably different from the danzón-mambo of Orestes &quot;Cachao&quot; Lopez, which was a danzón with extra syncopation in its final part. The mambo—which became internationally famous—was a big-band product, the work of Perez Prado, who made some sensational recordings for RCA in their new recording studios in Mexico City in the late 1940s. About 27 of those recordings had Benny Moré as the singer, though the best sellers were mainly instrumentals. The big hits included &quot;Que rico el mambo&quot; (Mambo Jambo); &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot;; &quot;Mambo #8&quot;; &quot;Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)&quot;. The later (1955) hit &quot;Patricia&quot; was a mambo/rock fusion. Mambo of the Prado kind was more a descendant of the son and the guaracha than the danzón. In the U.S. the mambo craze lasted from about 1950 to 1956, but its influence on the bugaloo and salsa that followed it was considerable.
Violinist Enrique Jorrín invented the chachachá in the early 1950s. This was developed from the danzón by increased syncopation. The chachachá became more popular outside Cuba when the big bands of Perez Prado and Tito Puente produced arrangements that attracted American and European audiences.

Along with &quot;Nuyoricans&quot; Ray Barretto and Tito Puente and others, several waves of Cuban immigrants introduced their ideas into US music. Among these was Celia Cruz, a guaracha singer. Others were active in Latin jazz, such as percussionist Patato Valdés of the Cuban-oriented &quot;Tipíca &#x27;73&quot;, linked to the Fania All-Stars. Several former members of Irakere have also become highly successful in the US, among them Paquito D&#x27;Rivera and Arturo Sandoval. Tata Güines, a famous conguero, moved to New York City in 1957, playing with jazz players such as Dizzy Gillespie, Maynard Ferguson, and Miles Davis at Birdland. As a percussionist, he performed with Josephine Baker and Frank Sinatra. He returned to Cuba in 1959 after Fidel Castro came to power in the Cuban Revolution, which he helped fund with contributions from his earnings as a musician.

===Mambo===
Mambo is a musical genre and dance style that developed originally in Cuba. The word &quot;mambo&quot;, similar to other Afroamerican musical denominations as conga, milonga, bomba, tumba, samba, bamba, bamboula, tambo, tango, cumbé, cumbia and candombe, denotes an African origin, particularly from Congo, due to the presence of certain characteristic combinations of sounds, such as mb, ng and nd, which belong to the Niger-Congo linguistic complex.

The earliest roots of the Cuban mambo can be traced to the &quot;Danzón de Nuevo Ritmo&quot; (Danzón with a new rhythm) made popular by the orchestra &quot;Arcaño y sus Maravillas&quot; conducted by famous bandleader Antonio Arcaño. He was the first to denominate a section of the popular Cuban Danzón as a &quot;mambo.&quot; It was Arcaño&#x27;s cellist, Orestes López, who created the first danzón called &quot;Mambo&quot; (1938). In this piece, some syncopated motives, taken from the Son style, were combined with improvised flute passages.

Pianist and arranger from Matanzas, Cuba, Dámaso Pérez Prado (1927) established his residence in Havana at the beginning of the 1940s and began to work at night clubs and orchestras, such as Paulina Alvarez&#x27;s and Casino de La Playa. In 1949 he traveled to Mexico looking for job opportunities and achieved great success with a new style, to which he assigns a name that had been already utilized by Antonio Arcaño, the &quot;Mambo.&quot;

Perez Prado&#x27;s style differed from the previous &quot;mambo&quot; concept. The new style possessed a greater influence from the North American jazz band music, and an expanded instrumentation consisting of four or five trumpets, four of five saxophones, double bass, drum set, maracas, cowbell, congas and bongoes. The new &quot;mambo&quot; included a catchy counterpoint between the trumpets and the saxophones, that impulsed the body to move along with the rhythm, stimulated at the end of each musical phrase by a characteristic deep throat sound expression.

Prado&#x27;s recordings were meant for the Latin American and U.S. Latino markets, but some of his most celebrated mambos, such as &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; and &quot;Que Rico el Mambo&quot;, quickly crossed over to the United States.

===Chachachá===

Chachachá is a genre of Cuban music. It has been a popular dance music which developed from the Danzón-mambo in the early 1950s, and became widely popular throughout the entire world.

Chachachávis a Cuban music genre whose creation has been traditionally attributed to Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrín, which began his career playing for the charanga band Orquesta América.

According to the testimony of Enrique Jorrín, he composed some &quot;Danzones&quot; in which the musician of the orchestra had to sing short refrains, and this style was very successful. In the danzón &quot;Constancia&quot; he introduced some montunos and the audience was motivated to join in singing the refrains. Jorrín also asked the members of the orchestra to sing in unison so the lyrics may be heard more clearly and achieve a greater impact in the audience. That way of singing also helped to mask the poor singing skills of the orchestra members.

Since its inception, chachachá music had a close relationship with the dancer&#x27;s steps. The well-known name &quot;chachachá&quot; came into being with the help of the dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer&#x27;s feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. It was like an onomatopoeia that sounded as: chachachá. From this peculiar sound, a music genre was born which motivated people from around the world to dance to its catchy rhythm.

According to Olavo ALén: &quot;During the 1950s, Chachachá maintained its popularity thanks to the efforts of many Cuban composers who were familiar with the technique of composing &quot;danzones&quot; and who unleashed their creativity on the Chachachá&quot;, such as Rosendo Ruiz, Jr. (&quot;Los Marcianos&quot; and &quot;Rico Vacilón&quot;), Félix Reina (&quot;Dime Chinita,&quot; &quot;Como Bailan Cha-cha-chá los Mexicanos&quot;), Richard Egűes (&quot;El Bodeguero&quot; and &quot;La Cantina&quot;) and Rafael Lay (&quot;Cero Codazos, Cero Cabezazos&quot;).

The chachachá was first presented to the public through the instrumental medium of the &quot;charanga&quot;, a typical Cuban dance-band format made up of a flute, strings, piano, bass and percussion. The popularity of the chachachá also revived the popularity of this kind of orchestra.

=== Filin ===

Filin was a Cuban fashion of the 1940s and 1950s, influenced by popular music in the US. The word is derived from &quot;feeling&quot;. It describes a style of post-microphone jazz-influenced romantic song (crooning). Its Cuban roots were in the bolero and the canción. Some Cuban quartets, such as Cuarteto d&#x27;Aida and Los Zafiros, modelled themselves on U.S. close-harmony groups. Others were singers who had heard Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Nat King Cole. A house in Havana, where the trovador Tirso Díaz lived, became a meeting-place for singers and musicians interested in filin such as: Luis Yañez, César Portillo de la Luz, José Antonio Méndez, Niño Rivera, José Antonio Ñico Rojas, Elena Burke, Froilán, Aida Diestro and Frank Emilio Flynn. Here lyricists and singers could meet arrangers, such as Bebo Valdés, El Niño Rivera (Andrés Hechavarria), Peruchín (Pedro Justiz), and get help to develop their work. Filin singers included César Portillo de la Luz, José Antonio Méndez, who spent a decade in Mexico from 1949 to 1959, Frank Domínguez, the blind pianist Frank Emilio Flynn, and the great singers of boleros Elena Burke and the still-performing Omara Portuondo, who both came from the Cuarteto d&#x27;Aida. The filin movement originally had a place every afternoon on &quot;Radio Mil Diez&quot;. Some of its most prominent singers, such as Pablo Milanés, later took up the banner of the Nueva Trova.

===1960s and &#x27;70s===

Modern Cuban music is known for its relentless mixing of genres. For example, the 1970s saw Los Irakere use batá in a big band setting; this became known as son-batá or batá-rock. Later artists created the mozambique, which mixed conga and mambo; and batá-rumba, which mixed rumba and batá drum music. Mixtures including elements of hip hop, jazz and rock and roll are also common, like in Habana Abierta&#x27;s rockoson.

====Revolutionary Cuba and Cuban exiles====
The triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959 signalled the emigration of many musicians to Puerto Rico, Florida and New York, and in Cuba artists and their work came under the protection (and control) of the Socialist state, and the monopoly state-owned recording company EGREM. The Castro government abolished copyright laws in Cuba, closed many of the venues where popular music used to be played (e.g. night clubs), and so indirectly threw many musicians out of work.p202 This undoubtedly had deleterious effects on the evolution of popular music and dance.
Many young musicians now studied classical music and not popular music. All musicians employed by the state were given academic courses in music. In Cuba, the Nueva Trova movement (including Pablo Milanés) reflected the new leftist ideals. The state took over the lucrative Tropicana Club, which continued as a popular attraction for foreign tourists until 1968, when it was closed along with many other music venues (and later reopened with the rebirth of tourism). p202 Tourism was almost non-existent for three decades. Traditional Cuban music could be found in local Casas de la Trova. Musicians, if in work, were full-time and paid by the state after graduating from a conservatory. The collapse of the USSR in 1991, and the loss of its support for Cuba changed the situation quite a bit. Tourism became respectable again, and so did popular music for their entertainment. Musicians were even allowed to tour abroad and earn a living outside the state-run system.

Famous artists from the Cuban exile include Celia Cruz and the whole conjunto she sang with, the Sonora Matancera. &#x27;Patato&#x27; (Carlos Valdes), Cachao, La Lupe, Arturo Sandoval, Willy Chirino, Hansel y Raul, La Palabra, Paquito D&#x27;Rivera, Bebo Valdés and Gloria Estefan are some others. Many of these musicians, especially Cruz, became closely associated with the anti-revolutionary movement, and as &#x27;unpersons&#x27; have been omitted from the standard Cuban reference books, and their subsequent musical recordings are never on sale in Cuba.

====Salsa====


Salsa was the fourth innovation based on Cuban music to hit the US, and differed in that it was initially developed in the US, not in Cuba. Because Cuba has so many indigenous types of music there has always been a problem in marketing the &#x27;product&#x27; abroad to people who did not understand the differences between rhythms that, to a Cuban, are quite distinct. So, twice in the 20th century, a kind of product label was developed to solve this problem. The first occasion was in the 1930s after &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot; became an international success. It was called a &#x27;rumba&#x27; even though it really had nothing to do with genuine rumba: the number was obviously a son pregon. The label &#x27;rumba&#x27; was used outside Cuba for years as a catch-all for Cuban popular music.
The second occasion happened during the period 1965–1975 in New York City, as musicians of Cuban and Puerto-Rican origin combined to produce the great music of the post Cha-cha-cha period. This music acquired the label of &#x27;salsa&#x27;. No-one really knows how this happened, but everyone recognised what a benefit it was to have a common label for son, mambo, guaracha, guajira, guaguancó, etc. Cubans and non Cubans, such as Tito Puente, Rubén Blades and many experts of the Cuban music and salsa, have always said &quot;Salsa is just another name for Cuban, music. Tito Puentes once said, now they call it Salsa, later they may call it Stir Fry, but to me it will alway be Cuban Music&quot;; but over time salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late 1960s Willie Colón developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms. New York radio programmes offered &#x27;salsarengue&#x27; as a further combination. A band of the 1940s playing Cuban music uses the same exact instruments as salsa music. Later still &#x27;Salsa romantica&#x27; was the label for an especially sugary type of bolero. Even when, Benny Moré, Perez Prado the greatest Sonero that ever existed, was singing boleros with a salsa cadence in the 1940s. It was not until the 1950s that Cuban music became popular for Puerto Rican bands. Plena, Bomba and other styles of music were popular at the time in Puerto Rico. Many famous Puerto Rican musicians went to learn the music styles of Cubans in the 1930s and 1940s, and it was not until the arrival of Castro in 1959 and the Cuban music stopped its exportation to the world, that Puerto Ricans in New York were able to be greatly noticed, but what is known as salsa today was brought to New York in the 1920s and 1930s by Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo, this last one was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie as he was one of the greatest percussionists that ever lived.

The question of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be seen. Later it became clear that not only was New York salsa different from popular music in Cuba, but salsa in Venezuela, Colombia and other countries could also be distinguished. It also seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s. The reasons for this are also much disputed.

====Nueva trova====


Paralleling nueva canción in Latin America is the Cuban nueva trova, which dates from about 1967/68, after the Cuban Revolution. It differed from the traditional trova, not because the musicians were younger, but because the content was, in the widest sense, political. Nueva trova is defined by its connection with Castro&#x27;s revolution, and by its lyrics, which attempt to escape the banalities of life by concentrating on socialism, injustice, sexism, colonialism, racism and similar issues. Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés became the most important exponents of this style. Carlos Puebla and Joseíto Fernández were long-time old trova singers who added their weight to the new regime, but of the two only Puebla wrote special pro-revolution songs.

Nueva trova had its heyday in the 1970s, but was already declining before the fall of the Soviet Union. Examples of non-political styles in the nueva trova movement can be found, for example, Liuba María Hevia whose lyrics are focused on more traditional subjects such as love and solitude, sharing with the rest a highly poetical style. On the other side of the spectrum, Carlos Varela is famous in Cuba for his open criticism of some aspects of Castro&#x27;s revolution.

The nueva trova, initially so popular, suffered both inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences around the world have had their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so relevant in the 1960s and 1970s now seem dry and passé. Even &quot;Guantanamera&quot; has been damaged by over-repetition in less skilled hands. All the same, those pieces of high musical and lyrical quality, among which Puebla&#x27;s &quot;Hasta siempre, Comandante&quot; stands out, may last as long as Cuba lasts.

===1980s to the present===

Son remains the basis of most popular forms of modern Cuban music. Son is represented by long-standing groups like Septeto Nacional, which was re-established in 1985, Orquesta Aragón, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental and Orquesta Original de Manzanillo. Sierra Maestra, is famous for having sparked a revival in traditional son in the 1980s. Nueva trova still has influence, but the overtly political themes of the 1960s are well out of fashion. Meanwhile, Irakere fused traditional Cuban music with jazz, and groups like NG La Banda, Orishas and Son 14 continued to add new elements to son, especially hip hop and funk, to form timba music; this process was aided by the acquisition of imported electronic equipment. There are still many practitioners of traditional &quot;son montuno&quot;, such as Eliades Ochoa, who have recorded and toured widely as a result of interest in the &quot;son montuno&quot; after the Buena Vista Social Club success. Europe-based Cuban female singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes merged her roots of Son and Filin with elements of urban, rock and pop-music, reaching mainstream airplay charts in Germany.

In the 1990s, increased interest in world music coincided with the post-Soviet Union &quot;periodo especial&quot; in Cuba, during which the economy began opening up to tourism. Orquesta Aragón, Charanga Habanera and Cándido Fabré y su Banda have been long-time players in the charanga scene, and helped form the popular timba scene of the late 1990s. The biggest award in modern Cuban music is the Beny Moré Award.

====Timba====

Cubans have never been content to hear their music described as &quot;salsa&quot;, even though it is crystal clear that this &quot;was&quot; a label for their music. Since the early 1990s Timba has been used to describe popular dance music in Cuba, rivaled only lately by Reggaetón. Though derived from the same roots as salsa, Timba has its own characteristics, and is intimately tied to the life and culture of Cuba, and especially Havana.

As opposed to salsa, whose roots are strictly from Son and the Cuban &quot;conjunto&quot; bands of the 1940s and 1950s, Timba represents a synthesis of many folkloric (rumba, guaguancó, batá drumming and the sacred songs of santería.), and popular sources (even taking inspiration from non Afro Cuban musical genres such as rock, jazz and funk). According to Vincenzo Perna, author of &quot;Timba: The Sound of the Cuban Crisis&quot;, timba needs to be spoken of because of its musical, cultural, social, and political reasons; its sheer popularity in Cuba, its novelty and originality as a musical style, the skill of its practitioners, its relationship with both local traditions and the culture of the black Diaspora, its meanings, and the way its style brings to light the tension points within society. In addition to timbales, timba drummers make use of the drum-set, further distinguishing the sound from that of mainland salsa. The use of synthesised keyboard is also common. Timba songs tend to sound more innovative, experimental and frequently more virtuosic than salsa pieces; horn parts are usually fast, at times even bebop influenced, and stretch to the extreme ranges of all instruments. Bass and percussion patterns are similarly unconventional. Improvisation is commonplace.

====Revival projects====
Several projects gained international attention in the 1990s due to their revival of traditional music styles such as the son cubano of the septeto and the conjunto era. Founded in 1976, Sierra Maestra (band) was one of the first revivalist groups in Cuba. In 1995, Juan de Marcos González, director and tres player of Sierra Maestra, was contacted by Nick Gold (head of World Circuit Records) to record a traditional Cuban album featuring African musicians. In the end, the African musicians could not make it to Havana, so the project became a 100% Cuban affair featuring veteran Cuban musicians such as Rubén González, Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo and Omara Portuondo. It spawned two bands, both of which involved American guitarist Ry Cooder: Afro-Cuban All Stars and Buena Vista Social Club. Both bands recorded their debut albums, &quot;A Toda Cuba le Gusta&quot; and &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, respectively, in March 1996. The release of the latter in September 1997 was a true watershed event. The album became a worldwide hit, selling millions of copies and turning established musicians into globally renowned figures.
&quot;Buena Vista&quot; resulted in several follow-up recordings and spawned a film of the same name, as well as tremendous interest in other Cuban groups. In subsequent years, dozens of singers and &quot;conjuntos&quot; made recordings for foreign labels and toured internationally.

The conclusion some have drawn is that the wholesale closure of popular music venues (after the revolution), which threw many musicians out of work, and subsequent control by state committees, damaged the development of Cuban popular music.

====Hip hop====
Hip hop grew steadily more popular in Cuba in the 1980s and 1990s through Cuba&#x27;s Special Period. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cuban economy went into decline. Poverty became more widespread and visible in Cuba. In the 1990s, some Cubans started to protest this situation by means of rap and hip-hop. During this period of economic crisis, which the country&#x27;s poor and black populations especially hard, hip hop became a way for the country&#x27;s Afro-descended population to embrace their blackness and articulate a demand for racial equality for black people in Cuba. The idea of blackness and black liberation was not always compatible with the goals of the Cuban government, which was still operating under the idea that a raceless society was the correct realization of the Cuban Revolution. When hip-hop emerged, the Cuban government opposed the vulgar image that rappers portrayed, but later accepted that it might be better to have hip-hop under the influence of the Ministry of Culture as an authentic expression of Cuban Culture. Rap music in Cuba is heavily influenced by the country&#x27;s pre-existing musical traditions, such as salsa and rumba.

In some ways, hip hop is tolerated by the government of Cuba and performers are provided with venues and equipment by the government. The Cuban rap and hip-hop scene sought out the involvement of the Ministry of Culture in the production and promotion of their music, which would otherwise have been impossible to accomplish. After the Cuban government provided lukewarm endorsement, the Cuban Rap Agency provided the Cuban rap scene, in 2002, with a state-sponsored record label, magazine, and Cuba&#x27;s own hip-hop festival.

The government gives rap and hip-hop groups time on mass media outlets in return for hip-hop artists limiting self-expression and presenting the government in a positive way. Rappers who explicitly speak about race or racism in Cuba are still under scrutiny by the government. The government recognizes that hip-hop is growing in Cuba, and would be difficult to eliminate.

====Cubatón====

Like Spanish reggae from Panama is a new genre for the Cubans but by 2012 was so massively popular that &quot;the face of Cuban pop music&quot; was considered to be Cuban reggae (cubatón) singer, Osmani García &quot;La Voz&quot;. The advent of web software helped to distribute music unofficially. Both lyrics and dance movements have been criticised. Reggaeton musicians such as responded by making songs that defended their music. Despite their efforts, the Ministry of Culture has ruled that reggaeton is not to be used in teaching institutions, parties and at discos, and in 2011 restricted its airplay after massive popularity of García&#x27;s &quot;Chupi Chupi&quot;, which referred to oral sex. Other popular cubatón artists include Eddy K, El Taiger and Gente de Zona (&quot;People from the &#x27;Hood&quot;).

===Rock music in Cuba===


The musical interaction between Cuba and the US is ancient. Already in the 18th century, during the Spanish rule of Louisiana (1763–1803), the Havanese orchestras and bands offered concerts in New Orleans and in the 19th century the Cuban contradanza was very popular in the US. At the beginning of the 20th century, the first jazz bands were created in Cuba, in the style of the American groups. The &quot;Sagua&quot; Jaz Band was founded in Sagua la Grande in 1914 by Pedro Stacholy (conductor and pianist). The group played during 14 years at the Teatro Principal de Sagua.

The strong influence of the American music on the Cuban younger generations gave way to the beginning of the soloists and groups of rock and roll in Cuba during the 1950s. Many Cuban artists sang versions of American songs translated to Spanish, as it was also happening in Mexico.

The launching of the group Los LLopis represented the entrance in a new stage for the Cuban music, that of the generation and amplification of the sound by electroacoustic devices; because in the sound composition of this group one can observe a novel element of great importance, the inclusion of an electric guitar.

In 1961, other artists emerged such as Dany Puga, called the King of Twist, and bands such as Los Satélites, Los Diablos Melódicos and Los Enfermos del Rock, as well as Los Halcones and Los Huracanes from Marianao.

The vocal quartet Los Zafiros was another successful group from the beginning of the sixties. Founded in 1961, it was influenced by the doo-wop style of The Platters, The Diamonds and other American groups, and counted on a repertoire consisting of ballads, calypsos and bossanovas, as well as songs with a slow rock ad bolero rhythms.

At that time, the popular group Los Astros, led by the singer and guitarist Raúl Gómez, was threatened by pressures exerted by the Fidel Castro regime over the rock groups, which were considered as a form of &quot;ideological diversionism&quot; and actively opposed in all its manifesations. Its style, strongly influenced by the British Invasion groups, as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, was labelled as &quot;deviant&quot; and consequently repressed without any hesitation. Since then, the Revolutionary government of Cuba began to implement an absolute control over all aspects of the Cuban society, including, of course, all cultural expressions.

Around 1965, the Revolutionary government implemented a strategy to substitute the foreign products that the young people preferred, with others that better matched their official guidelines; and as a result of this strategy, a new radio program called Nocturno was broadcast in 1966, which initial musical theme was &quot;La chica de la valija&quot; (Girl with a suitcase) from the Italian sax player Fausto Papetti. The program presented modern songs, giving priority to the European repertoire in Spanish language of soloists and groups such as Los Mustang, Los Bravos, Los Brincos, Juan y Junior, Rita Pavone, Massiel, Nino Bravo, Leonardo Fabio, Salvatore Adamo and Raphael, and some Cuban groups as Los Zafiros and Los Dan. The ban against rock music was lifted in 1966, but rock fans continued to be marginalized by the communist establishment, and watched over with suspicion as &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;.

Actually, rock music began to be heard in Havana during the seventies, in a radio program from Radio Marianao called Buenas Tardes Juventud. That program presented groups such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Dave Clark Five, The Animals, Grand Funk, Rare Earth, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, Neil Sedaka and Paul Anka. At the beginning of the eighties, that radio station joined Radio Ciudad de La Habana.

In 1979, a three-day music festival called Havana Jam took place at the Karl Marx Theater, in Havana, Cuba, where a group of rock artists that included Billy Joel and Stephen Stills performed.

In the 1980s, a heavy metal band called Venus was formed by Roberto Armada in Municipio Playa. They achieved much success and created a headbanger following among the Cuban youth. Punk rock was introduced in Cuba in the late 1980s and gained a cult-type following among a minority of the youth.

During the nineties, rock and roll in Cuba was still an underground phenomenon. In Havana, the &quot;Ciudad de La Habana&quot; radio station presented several programs showing the most recent tendencies on that type of music around the world. Juan Camacho, an old musician and radio host had a morning program called &quot;Disco Ciudad&quot;. &quot;El Programa de Ramón&quot; was also a successful radio show. Some bands from that period were Gens, Zeus and Los Tarsons.

In 2001, the Welsh group Manic Street Preachers was invited to perform in Cuba, and Fidel Castro attended its concert along with other government authorities. In 2004, Castro gave a speech honoring the birthday of John Lennon, whose music, as a member of The Beatles and as a soloist, was banned in Cuba for a very long time. A bronze statue of Lennon was placed in a Havanese well-known park, and it achieved notoriety for being a victim of constant vandalism from passersby that frequently stole its bronze spectacles.

At the same time that the government was showing a more indulgent attitude toward the foreign rock groups, as part of an international campaign which purpose was to achieve an opening in the commercial transactions and investments of the US and Europe in Cuba, it continued to implement an inflexible repression against any form of internal dissidence. This was the case of the rocker Gorki Águila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August 2008, Águila was arrested under charges of dangerousness, a law that allows the authorities to detain people whom they think are likely to commit crimes, even when they have not yet committed them.

More recently, Rick Wakeman, Sepultura and Audioslave performed in Havana, and The Rolling Stones offered a historic concert.

A new phenomenon occurred in 2013 when several Cuban underground metal bands begin to emigrate to the United States, creating a parallel scene with the bands Agonizer, Escape, Ancestor, Hipnosis, Suffering Tool and Chlover.

<text>Coruscant () is an ecumenopolis planet in the fictional universe of &quot;Star Wars.&quot; It was first described in Timothy Zahn&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Heir to the Empire.&quot; The planet made its first on-screen appearance in a scene added to &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; for its 1997 re-release. It has gone on to become an important location in 
the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe and appears frequently in &quot;Star Wars&quot; media.
In-universe, Coruscant is a politically and strategically important planet, serving as the capital and seat of government for the Republic and the Galactic Empire, as well as the headquarters of the Jedi Order. It is depicted as a bustling, yet highly stratified planet-spanning metropolis. Throughout the city&#x27;s centuries-long development, new city blocks were built on top of old ones, forming levels. Coruscant has 5127 levels, with the top being the wealthiest and the lowest being the poorest.

Coruscant has four moons and is the sixth planet out of the eleven that make up the system of the same name. It lies within the Coruscant Subsector of the Corusca Sector, located in the Core Worlds galactic quadrant region. The sun, Coruscant Prime, is the zero coordinate of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy (as opposed to being its galactic center). In &quot;Legends&quot;, Coruscant was once referred to as Notron or Queen of the Core. It was renamed Imperial Center during the reign of the Galactic Empire (as depicted in the original films) and Yuuzhan&#x27;tar during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion (as depicted in the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; novel series). Initially, the planet&#x27;s capital city was Galactic City (built at least in 100,000 BBY, partially destroyed in 27 and 44 ABY). It was Imperial City under the Galactic Empire and was Republic City (or the City of Spires) under the Galactic Republic. The planet was code-named Triple Zero during the Clone Wars. The demonym and adjective form of the planet&#x27;s name is Coruscanti.

Many native citizens of Coruscant speak with the Received Pronunciation accent (known in-universe as Coruscanti).

==Etymology and naming==
In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the planet Coruscant derives its name from a rare and valuable gemstone, the corusca gem (a fictional gem in &quot;Star Wars&quot; lore). The lights of the planet-wide city, as seen from space, were said to resemble the glittering of these gems.

In the real world, the word “coruscant” originates in the late 15th century from the Latin word &quot;coruscant&quot;, meaning &quot;vibrating, glittering.&quot; It comes from the Latin verb &quot;coruscare&quot;, meaning “to glitter.” The &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot; defines it as a poetic and literary adjective meaning &quot;glittering; sparkling.&quot; In French, “coruscant” is also used as an adjective meaning “glittering; sparkling.” As a literary adjective, the French term can be used to describe a decadent and overly complicated language, decorum, or community.

==Early concepts==
The concept of a city-planet in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe originated with the initial drafts of &quot;Star Wars&quot; when author George Lucas included a planet called &quot;Alderaan,&quot; a city-planet and the capital planet of the galaxy. In Lucas&#x27;s 1975 draft, &quot;Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars&quot;, the capital planet of Alderaan is described as a floating city in the clouds, &quot;suspended in a sea of cirrus methane.&quot; This concept was illustrated in early sketches commissioned by Lucas from conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie, and the design very closely resembles Cloud City, the floating city featured in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. In Lucas&#x27;s third draft, the Imperial City of Alderaan became the homeworld of the Sith Lords, where Darth Vader held Princess Leia captive. Lucas continued to hone his script, aided by screenwriters Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. By the fourth draft, scenes on the Imperial capital planet had been moved to a space station called the Death Star and the name of Alderaan was given to a peaceful world destroyed by the Empire.
The Empire&#x27;s homeworld, Had Abbadon, came up in early drafts of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The entire planet was to be a sprawling city. However, concluding that the realization of such a city was impossible at the time, the creators abandoned the idea. Later, in the graphic novel &quot;Legacy 29: Vector, Part 10&quot; the name Had Abbadon was given to a lost mythic planet in the Had Abbadon System of the Deep Core. This mythic planet was covered by dry fields, linked to the birth of the Jedi, and the location of a planned assassination attempt by Cade Skywalker on Darth Krayt. It was also the home to an Imperial.

The Empire&#x27;s homeworld first appeared in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe and was called Coruscant for the first time in Timothy Zahn&#x27;s &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;.

In various novels, characters aligned with the Empire refer to Coruscant as the &quot;Imperial Center&quot;. Within the stories, this is explained as an administrative renaming undertaken to emphasize the differences between the Old Republic and the Empire.

Coruscant was in some early sources called &quot;Jhantor&quot; in homage to Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Trantor.

==Design==
Production artwork produced by Ralph McQuarrie for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; included some unrealized designs for the imperial capital, Had Abbadon. During the production of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, it was decided that scenes would be set on the capital planet, now called Coruscant. Artist Doug Chiang was tasked with designing the imperial city for which he turned to McQuarrie&#x27;s original concept art. The appearance of the cityscape has been described as a &quot;retro-futuristic metropolis&quot;, and the streams of floating vehicles traveling between soaring skyscrapers is thought to have been partly inspired by Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1927 film, &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

In &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, the depiction of Coruscant was expanded greatly. Chiang created a more urban, apocalyptic environment for the street level, taking inspiration from Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1982 hit film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

==Appearances==
=== &quot;Episode VI: Return of the Jedi&quot; ===
Coruscant is the location of a sequence added to the 1997 Special Edition release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, its first onscreen appearance. The sequence depicts the reaction of citizens of Coruscant upon hearing of the death of Emperor Palpatine, where many citizens are seen celebrating with fireworks and pulling down his statue. The 1998 novel &quot;X-Wing: Iron Fist&quot; included an eyewitness account of this scene.

=== &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; ===
Coruscant was prominently featured in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; as the location of the Galactic Republic Senate building and the central Jedi Temple.

=== &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; ===
There is a speeder chase through the skies of Coruscant in &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; that eventually leads to a nightclub in the bowels of Coruscant&#x27;s Uscru Entertainment District. Another area of Coruscant shown is &quot;Coco Town&quot; (short for &quot;collective commerce&quot;). Coco Town is the site of Dex&#x27;s Diner in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. Another notable area of Coruscant is 500 Republica, an area where the elites of the city, such as politicians and diplomats, gather.

=== &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot; ===
In &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot;, Coruscant is featured in a space battle (known as the Battle of Coruscant) during the opening scene. Separatist cyborg, General Grievous kidnaps Chancellor Palpatine and uses the Separatist fleet to help assault the capital and cover his escape.

The planet&#x27;s cityscape is then prominently featured throughout much of the movie with Chancellor Palpatine&#x27;s office as well as the Senate building being the primary two settings on Coruscant. A theatre in 500 Republica is where Anakin Skywalker and Palpatine watch a ballet; during the show, Palpatine encourages Skywalker to ally with the Dark Side by telling him of the supposed Sith ability of resuscitation.

After a failed attempt by the Jedi to arrest Palpatine when he divulges his true identity as Darth Sidious to Skywalker, Palpatine appoints himself Emperor of the first Galactic Empire in the Republic Senate Building on Coruscant.

===&quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; (2003 and 2008 TV series)===
Coruscant features prominently in both the 2003 traditionally-animated &quot;Clone Wars&quot; series and the 2008 animated &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; series, as the headquarters of the Jedi Temple and the Senate.

===&quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;===
In &quot;Rogue One&quot;, Jyn Erso has a flashback of her young self on Coruscant.

=== &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; ===
In &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, Coruscant makes its first extensive live-action appearance in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga since the prequel trilogy. Coruscant is prominent in a montage of footage from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel films, and the Jedi Temple of Coruscant is the setting of several scenes.

===&quot;Andor&quot;===
Coruscant is a prominent setting in the &quot;Andor&quot; series. All of Mon Mothma&#x27;s scenes take place on Coruscant as well as the majority of Dedra and Syril&#x27;s scenes.

===&quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;===
In &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;, Coruscant appears prominently in three of the six episodes. Count Dooku and Mace Windu attend the funeral of Council Member Katri at the Jedi Temple, Ahsoka Tano is shown extensively training for combat in the same location, and the final lightsaber duel between Master Yaddle and Count Dooku takes place in Darth Sidious&#x27; manufacturing-district lair. In one scene, Dooku remarks upon the fact that Coruscant is a planet of &quot;Steel and Stone&quot;, lacking much in the way of wild nature; Qui-Gon Jinn, who was born there, had never seen a tree before visiting the Jedi Temple for the first time as a boy.

=== &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; ===
In the 19th episode of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, Coruscant is featured as a New Republic capital. On Coruscant, we are re-introduced to Dr. Penn Pershing and Elia Kane, a former communications officer on Moff Gideon&#x27;s cruiser, who are now revealed to be a part of the New Republic Amnesty program. We are also introduced to the Shipyard Depot, a salvage yard where decommissioned Star Destroyers are being dismantled.

===Other works===
Coruscant appears as the background of a space battle in &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot;.

In &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot;, players can visit Coruscant&#x27;s Federal and Uscru Districts.

In the prologue of the comic series &quot;Dark Empire&quot; (1991), set after the original film trilogy, Coruscant is ravaged by battles between warring Imperial factions.

Coruscant appears as the opening level in 2023&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Survivor&quot;. Cal Kestis is tasked with tracking down Senator Daho Sejan, the player chasing after the senator&#x27;s yacht until catching up with it.

Coruscant is seen in the &quot;X-Wing&quot; series of computer games.

Concept art by Ralph McQuarrie served as the basis for the pyramidal Imperial Palace, depicted in &quot;The Illustrated Star Wars Universe&quot; (1995) by Kevin J. Anderson, which claims it is &quot;the largest structure on Coruscant, perhaps on any planet&quot;. According to the &quot;Star Wars Encyclopedia&quot; (1998), it is located next to the Senate building. Although this version of the Imperial Palace appears in a variety of Expanded Universe works, in canon, the Imperial Palace is located at the site of the former Jedi Temple, where Palpatine resides.

In &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; series (1999–2003), Coruscant is the capital world of the New Republic until, in &quot;The New Jedi Order: Star by Star&quot;, the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong overwhelm the New Republic defenses in three attack waves led by Warmaster Tsavong Lah who takes over the planet, destroying the New Republic and creating the theocratic Yuuzhan Vong Empire. After surrendering, the Yuuzhan Vong agreed to help the Alliance rebuild Coruscant. The new Coruscant is a combination of technology and organic life representing the peace between the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (Galactic Alliance) and the Yuuzhan Vong.

James Luceno&#x27;s novel &quot;Labyrinth of Evil&quot; (2005) introduces a deserted manufacturing area known as &#x27;The Works&#x27; as the meeting place for Sith Lords Darth Sidious (Palpatine) and Darth Tyranus.

With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were re-branded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.

===Notable metropolitan areas===
==== Senate District ====
The Senate District (also sometimes referred to as the Federal District) is located on the planet&#x27;s equator, and is known to contain numerous notable sites such as the Ambassadorial Sector (canonically home to &quot;500 Republica&quot; and the Senate Apartment Complex), Embassy Mall, the Coruscant Opera House, the Galactic Museum, the Heorem Complex (where the Heorem Skytunnel is located), Judicial Plaza (home to the Glitanni Esplanade and the Judicial Arcology), the Legislative Borough, Senate Plaza, the Avenue Of The Core Founders, the Republic Executive Building, the Galactic Senate Building, Hospital Plaza, the Galactic Senate, the Palace District (home to the Imperial Palace and Senate Hill), Quadrant A-89 (home to the CSF HQ), the Fellowship Plaza, the Galactic Justice Center and the Temple Precinct (home to the Jedi Temple), Sector H-52, Sector I-33, the Uscru Boulevard, Westport and Xizor&#x27;s Palace. 

The Senate District is depicted as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Coruscant, the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, the New Republic, the Galactic Federation Of Free Alliances, and the One Sith. It is shown bordering the Financial District and the Sah&#x27;c District and is also adjacent to The Works (an industrial sector on the planet). The Senate District is also referred to as the Legislative District, Government District, and Government Center.

==== Alien Protection Zone ====
The Alien Protection Zone is referenced as a walled ghetto on Coruscant of an unknown location, housing the planet&#x27;s non-human population. Neighborhoods within the zone are shown representing the cultures of these minority groups. The Alien Protection Zone was constructed in 19 BBY by the Galactic Empire and opened by the New Republic in 6 ABY.

==== Sah&#x27;c Town ====
Sah&#x27;c Town, also known as Sah&#x27;c District or Quadrant H-46, is an area described as situated on the Equator, named after and controlled by the wealthy Sah&#x27;c family. It was home to an emergency bunker where the chancellor of the Galactic Republic or New Republic ruled in case of emergencies. The area also contains Sah&#x27;c Canyon, which is the exit point of the Senate District&#x27;s Heorem Skytunnel.

Uscru District

The Uscru District appears in &quot;Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith,&quot; and &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot;. On its upper levels, it hosts the Galaxy&#x27;s Opera House. The district&#x27;s lower levels were collectively referred to as the Entertainment District. The Outlander Club, seen in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and mentioned in &quot;Jedi: Fallen Order,&quot; is in the Entertainment District.

<doc id="240764" wikidata="Q1458168" url="?curid=240764" title="Ralph Wiggum">
<text>Ralph Wiggum is a recurring character in the animated series &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright. Ralph is characterized largely by his frequent non-sequiturs which range from nonsensical and bizarre to profound. His dim-witted behavior lends him an air of blissful ignorance.

The creator of the show, Matt Groening, has cited Ralph as his favorite character. He generally remains one of the more popular and often quoted secondary characters in the show. In 2006, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Ralph No. 3 on their list of the &quot;Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters,&quot; behind Sideshow Bob and Troy McClure.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Ralph is characterized as a slow-witted and good-natured 8-year-old boy in Lisa Simpson&#x27;s second-grade class, taught by Ms. Hoover. Initially, he was mostly used as a silent background character without consistent characterization. However, in later seasons his role expanded, being a featured character in several episodes. 

These episodes include: &quot;I Love Lisa&quot;, an episode which set him apart from other tertiary characters and largely defined much of his character, &quot;This Little Wiggy&quot; and &quot;E Pluribus Wiggum&quot;; as well as appearances both minor and prominent in many other episodes. Ralph also appears in various other media, such as the Simpsons comic book series by Bongo, and has even received his own entry in The Simpsons Library of Wisdom series.

===Personality===

Ralph&#x27;s primary role in the show is to deliver clueless asides and odd &quot;non-sequiturs.&quot; Ralph is presented as quite stupid, verbally challenged, and slow. In one of his most famous quotes, Ralph responds to the news that he is failing English class with the retort: &quot;Me fail English? That&#x27;s unpossible!&quot;

In other instances, Ralph has been shown to speak with relative ease, notably in &quot;I Love Lisa&quot; when he gives an uncharacteristically powerful performance as George Washington in a school play. Occasionally, Ralph has been used to break the fourth wall straightforwardly.

Although it has never been explicitly stated in any &quot;Simpsons&quot;-related media that Ralph is intellectually disabled and/or brain damaged, Chief Wiggum drops baby Ralph in a flashback sequence, with the latter landing flat on his head. When Wiggum picks Ralph up again, Ralph suddenly has difficulty drinking out of his bottle.

==Creation and design==
Ralph was named after Ralph Kramden, the character on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; portrayed by comedian Jackie Gleason. Ralph&#x27;s first credited appearance in the show was in the episode &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot;, where he was considerably different in appearance and behavior. Ralph&#x27;s modern design first appeared in the second-season episode &quot;Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment&quot;. Early Ralph spoke with a voice similar to that of Nelson Muntz&#x27;s until Cartwright settled into his higher-pitched whine. Originally intended to be a &quot;Mini-Homer,&quot; Ralph eventually took on a life of his own. The staff later retconned Ralph into the son of Chief Wiggum, a fact initially hinted at in &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; and later made canon in &quot;I Love Lisa&quot;. Groening considers Ralph &quot;really hard to write.&quot; 

Ralph&#x27;s normal attire usually consists of a blue long-sleeve shirt with a collar, a belt with a red buckle, and brown pants. However, almost all &quot;Simpsons-&quot;related media and merchandise, portray Ralph with white or light gray colored pants. Ralph&#x27;s hair is meant to evoke a bowl-cut style. In one particular issue of the comic book, Ralph is drawn in a realistic style, depicted with blonde hair. Adult Ralph in &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; has light brown hair.

==Reception==
Ralph has become one of the show&#x27;s most popular characters. He is commonly featured on media and merchandise related to the show, including the season 13 home media box set. Kidrobot released Ralph as a separate figure from the rest of their &quot;Simpsons&quot; line of figurines in 2009. The figure is twice as large as the others. The comedy band The Bloodhound Gang made a song titled &quot;Ralph Wiggum&quot; on the album &quot;Hefty Fine,&quot; dedicated to the character and composed solely of some of his most famous quotes for lyrics. Show creator Matt Groening has stated that writers will most likely take credit for Ralph when someone asks who writes specific characters, which is a common misconception about the writing process.

<doc id="240765" wikidata="Q940380" url="?curid=240765" title="Gibson SG">
<text>The Gibson SG is a solid-body electric guitar model introduced by Gibson in 1961, following on from the 1952 Gibson Les Paul. It remains in production today in many variations of the initial design. SG stands for &quot;solid guitar&quot;.

==Origins==
The SG design was given a thinner, more contoured body than the Les Paul, and a double cutaway. Not only did this make the upper frets more accessible, it was further eased by moving the neck joint outwards by three frets. The simpler body construction significantly reduced production costs, and the SG, with its slender neck profile and small heel where it joined the body, was advertised as having the &quot;fastest neck in the world&quot;.

Although the new guitar was popular, Les Paul strongly disliked it. Problems with the strength of the body and neck made Paul dissatisfied with the new guitar. At the same time, Paul was going through a public divorce from wife and vocalist partner Mary Ford, and his popularity was dwindling as music tastes had changed in the early 1960s. Paul asked lifelong friend and former President of Gibson Ted McCarty to withhold his $1 royalty per guitar, and Gibson mutually agreed to end the contract. Gibson also honored Les Paul&#x27;s request to remove his name from the guitar.

In the early-to-mid 1960s Gibson&#x27;s parent corporation, Chicago Musical Instruments, revived the Kalamazoo brand name for a short time. Later models of the KG-1 and KG-2 featured a body style similar to the Gibson SG, effectively creating a budget-line model until the brand was dropped in the late 1960s. Gibson currently makes lower-cost, internationally sourced versions of the SG at their subsidiary Epiphone.

Because of its ease of play, comfort to hold, popularity, and vintage heritage, the body style of the SG is often copied by other manufacturers, although much less frequently than the Les Paul and the Fender Stratocaster.

==Design==
The SG generally has a solid mahogany body, with a black pickguard. The 24.75&quot; scale mahogany neck joins the body at the 19th or 22nd fret. Early models had a smaller neck joint with a longer tenon. This neck design provided access above the 16th fret. Epiphone-made bolt-on neck models still use a 16th fret neck joint. The SG&#x27;s set neck is shallower than the Gibson Les Paul&#x27;s. The SG features the traditional Gibson combination of two or three humbucker pickups or P90 pickups and a Tune-o-matic bridge assembly, wraparound bridge, or vibrato tailpiece, depending on the model.

The SG Standard features pearloid trapezoid fretboard inlays, as well as fretboard binding and inlaid pearl &quot;Gibson&quot; logo and crown; the mid-level SG Special features pearloid dot inlays and an inlaid pearl &quot;Gibson&quot; logo, without a crown. The Standard has a volume and a tone control for each individual pickup, and a three-way switch that allows the player to select either the bridge pickup, the neck pickup, or both together. The SG does not include switching to coil split the humbuckers in stock form.

Some models use body woods other than mahogany; examples include the swamp ash SG Special, the SG Zoot Suit, made using multiple birch wood laminate, and the SG Voodoo, the 2009 &quot;Raw Power&quot;, and some walnut bodied 1970s models. High-end models, including the Diablo, occasionally sport decorative maple caps, carved tops, and gold hardware.

==Models and variations==


At the launch of the SG in 1961, Gibson offered four 
variants of the SG; the SG Junior (a stripped-down version of the standard, analogous to the Les Paul Junior), the SG Special, the SG Standard, and the top-of-the-line SG Custom.

As of 2010 Gibson&#x27;s current core variants were the SG Standard and the SG Special. Over the years, Gibson has offered many variations of the SG, and continues to manufacture special editions, including models such as the Special and Faded Special, Supreme, Artist Signature SGs, Menace, and Gothic, as well as the premium-priced VOS reissues of the sixties SG Standard and Custom.

Models produced between 1961 and early 1966 have the original small pickguard; in late 1966 the guitar was redesigned slightly, first with a longer, more robust neck joint, and then came the modern larger semi-symmetrical &quot;batwing&quot; pickguard. This design continued until late 1971 or early 1972, when variations of the SG were sold with a raised Les Paul style pickguard and a front-mounted control plate. The low-end SG-100 and the P-90 equipped SG-200 appeared during this time, as well as the luxurious SG Pro and SG Deluxe guitars. Vibrato (tremolo arm) tailpieces were also introduced as options.

In 1972 the design went back to the original style pickguard and rear-mounted controls but with the neck then set further into the body, joining roughly at the 20th fret. By the end of the seventies, the SG models returned to the original sixties styling, and modern (1991–present) standard and special models have mostly returned to the 1967–1969 styling and construction, with a few exceptions; various reissues and other models of the SG still retain the original 1961–1967 styling.

In 1979, a low-cost SG made of walnut wood was introduced called &quot;The SG.&quot; It had a clear finish and an ebony fingerboard and was accompanied by low-cost &quot;Les Paul&quot; and &quot;ES 335&quot; type guitars. &quot;The Paul&quot; was also made from walnut, but &quot;The ES&quot; was made out of solid mahogany (rather than the semi-solid body they usually produced). All three guitars were discontinued after about a year, replaced by the &quot;firebrand&quot; series, again made of mahogany. Also in 1979 a limited edition model, the SG Exclusive was produced. Visually similar to the SG Standard of the time, the special features included an ebony fretboard, two Dirty Fingers humbucker pickups, and a master volume, two tone controls, and rotary coil tap that gradually eliminated one coil from each humbucker. The finish was black with cream color plastics and the truss rod cover read &quot;Exclusive&quot;.

In 1980, the first SG manufactured with &quot;active&quot; factory pickups was introduced. Gibson experimented with an SG that included the same Moog active electronics that had previously been used in another Gibson model, the RD Artist. The resulting SG had a slightly thicker body to accommodate the extra circuitry, and was dubbed the &quot;Gibson SG-R1&quot;. The SG-R1 was renamed the &quot;SG Artist&quot; in 1981, and was discontinued shortly afterwards. Approximately 200 active SGs were produced.

In 2008, Gibson introduced the Robot SG, which feature a motorized tuning system developed by Tronical. Limited-edition variants include the SG Robot Special and the limited-edition Robot SG LTD. The Robot system was designed to be convenient for players who need to frequently change tunings, without requiring them to manually tune or carry several guitars; however, they also carry a significant price premium.

Around 2000 through 2009, Gibson introduced the SG Classic, which harked back to a Junior/Special type design, with bound mahogany fret board with dot inlays and two P-90 pickups, with a thin &#x27;60s neck profile.

In 2009, Gibson introduced the &quot;Raw Power&quot; line of SGs, which have an all-maple body, unbound maple neck and fretboard, and unique colors not previously seen in SGs. These models are priced between the entry-level Specials and the more expensive Standards. The year 2009 also brought the Guitar Center-exclusive SG Standard with Coil Taps available in both 50s and 60s style necks.

In 2013 Gibson released the new Gibson SG Baritone. This SG comes in Alpine white and has 24 frets. It comes tuned down two and a half steps to B-E-A-D-F#-B. It is made with a full mahogany body, Richlite fretboard 496R (Ceramic) Bridge Position 500T (Ceramic) pickups and a tune-o-matic bridge.

Gibson&#x27;s EB-3, EB-0, EDS-1275, and later model of Melody Maker and Kalamazoo also shared or once shared SG-shaped bodies, but these are not the members of the SG family.

Epiphone also offers a range of value-priced models, including a model with 1960s styling, sold as the G-400. These models often feature simpler construction than their Gibson counterparts, although they also often implement a number of features missing from production Gibson models; examples include the period-correct 1961 SG Special&#x27;s wraparound bridge (unavailable on any Gibson SG Special production model as of 2013), the 22&quot; scale SG Express, the metal-oriented &quot;Prophecy&quot; line (equipped with high-output humbuckers and unique inlays), and a replica of the Gibson EDS-1275, popularized by Jimmy Page.

==Unique SGs==

*Sister Rosetta Tharpe played a white Gibson Les Paul SG with three humbucking pickups, customized with an old-style maestro vibrato.
*Angus Young of AC/DC occasionally uses a custom-made SG with lightning-bolt inlays, based on a custom model originally produced by luthier John Diggins. Since then, Young has collaborated with Gibson to make the Angus Young SG which features a custom-designed Humbucker in the bridge position, a &#x27;57 Classic in the neck position and the lightning-bolt inlays.
*Robby Krieger of The Doors used a Gibson SG Standard starting in 1965. Gibson produced a limited run of 150 SG&#x27;s which incorporate many of Krieger&#x27;s favorite components of various SG&#x27;s.
* Eric Clapton used a 1964 Gibson SG Standard starting in 1967 while in Cream. This guitar was known as the &quot;Fool&quot; guitar, as it was painted by the Dutch artists known collectively as The Fool. In spring 1968, the SG was loaned to Jackie Lomax, an associate of George Harrison. The &quot;Fool&quot; was later sold to Todd Rundgren for $500 before eventually being sold to a private collector for about $500,000.
* Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath owns several custom-made black left-handed Gibson SGs with white cross-shaped fretboard inlays. Epiphone produces a similar guitar as the Tony Iommi G-400. Iommi&#x27;s original SG (used on the early Sabbath albums) was a modified cherry red, left-handed 1964 SG Special with P-90 pickups which he nicknamed &quot;Monkey&quot; after he added a sticker of a monkey playing a fiddle to the guitar.
* John Cipollina of Quicksilver Messenger Service used a custom Gibson SG with custom pickguards in the shape of bat-like figures, as well as the fret board being customized with unique patterns.
* Mike Oldfield used a modified 1963 SG with a guitar synthesizer pickup to control a Roland GR300 Module for some of his guitar sounds on his 1980s albums such as 1983&#x27;s &quot;Crises&quot; (including &quot;Shadow on the Wall&quot;), 1984&#x27;s &quot;Discovery&quot; (including the title track) and 1987&#x27;s &quot;Islands&quot; (including &quot;The Wind Chimes&quot;) as well as single-only tracks from this period such as 1984&#x27;s &quot;In The Pool&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot;.
* In 1992, the Gibson Custom Shop introduced a &quot;premium plus&quot; reissue of the &#x27;67 SG. There was an estimated run of 100 of these instruments. It included three &#x27;57 humbuckers, ABR-1 bridge, ebony fingerboard, slim tapered neck and a mother-of-pearl block. There were no certificates issued from Gibson on this particular run.
* In 1998 Gibson introduced a rarer, higher-specification version of the SG Special—The SG Special Limited Edition. It came with an ebony fingerboard, factory gold hardware, and two gold array Humbuckers.
* The 2015 Eden of Coronet guitar which earned the title of most valuable guitar in the world.

<doc id="240766" wikidata="Q1105187" url="?curid=240766" title="Cochrane Library">
<text>The Cochrane Library (named after Archie Cochrane) is a collection of databases in medicine and other healthcare specialties provided by Cochrane and other organizations. At its core is the collection of Cochrane Reviews, a database of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that summarize and interpret the results of medical research. The Cochrane Library aims to make the results of well-conducted clinical trials readily available and is a key resource in evidence-based medicine.

==Access and use==
The Cochrane Library is a subscription-based database, published initially by Update Software and now published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. as part of Wiley Online Library. In many countries, including parts of Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand, Australia, India, South Africa, and Poland, it has been made available free to all residents by &quot;national provision&quot; (typically a government or Department of Health pays for the license). There are also arrangements for free access in much of Latin America and in &quot;low-income countries&quot;, typically via HINARI. All countries have free access to two-page abstracts of all Cochrane Reviews and short plain-language summaries of selected articles.

Cochrane Reviews appear to be relatively underused in the United States for two reasons:
1) Public access to the Cochrane Library in the United States is limited (the state of Wyoming is an exception, having paid for a license to enable free access to Cochrane Reviews for all residents of Wyoming).
2) The government-funded U.S. National Library of Medicine maintains an alternative database MEDLINE, which is free of charge to everyone and has significantly more extensive coverage than Cochrane.

From 26 March to 26 May 2020, the Cochrane Library provided temporary unrestricted access to everyone in every country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Contents==
The Cochrane Library consists of the following databases after significant changes in 2018:
* The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews). Contains all the peer-reviewed systematic reviews and protocols (Cochrane Protocols) prepared by the Cochrane Review Groups.
* The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). CENTRAL is a database that contains details of articles of controlled trials and other studies of healthcare interventions from bibliographic databases (majorly MEDLINE and EMBASE), and other published and unpublished sources that are difficult to access, including trials from the trial registries such as International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. However, systematic reviewers need to search not only CENTRAL but also ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished studies. 
* Cochrane Clinical Answers. These evidence summaries on a variety of questions of interest to healthcare professionals have a user-friendly presentation with graphics and high-level conclusions of the research evidence based on Cochrane Reviews.

The Cochrane Library now also features results from Special Collections and Editorials as well as an option to link out to other reviews compiled by Epistemonikos.

The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Protocols, and CENTRAL are produced by Cochrane.

== &quot;The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews&quot; ==
The Cochrane reviews take the format of full-length methodological studies. Cochrane researchers will perform searches of medical and health databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, etc.; a continually updated database of trials called the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); hand searching, where researchers look through entire libraries of scientific journals by hand and; reference checking of obtained articles in order to identify additional studies that are relevant to the question they are attempting to answer. The quality of each study is carefully assessed using predefined criteria and evidence of weak methodology or the possibility that a study may have been affected by bias is reported in the review.

Cochrane researchers then apply statistical analysis to compare the data of the trials. This creates a review of studies, or systematic review, giving a comprehensive view of the efficacy of a particular medical intervention. Finished reviews are available as a full report with diagrams, in condensed form or as a plain language summary, in order to provide for every reader of the review.

=== Abstracting and indexing ===
According to &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, &quot;The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews&quot; has a 2021 impact factor of 11.874, ranking 20th of 172 journals in the Medicine, General and Internal category, down from 11th in 2020 (167 journals). Reviews are abstracted and indexed in the following bibliographic databases: Science Citation Index Expanded, Scopus, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE.

=== Academic comments ===
The Cochrane Library Feedback tool allows users to provide comments on and feedback of Cochrane Reviews and Protocols in The Cochrane Library. If accepted, the feedback will be published in a scrolling list of comments in reverse chronological order, with the most recent submission at the top of the page. The Collaboration has a procedure for the event of serious error, an event which has only occurred once in its history.

===Supplements===
Annual colloquia have been conducted by Cochrane since 1993. From 1994 onwards, Cochrane has maintained a database of posters and presentations of past colloquia. From 2009 onwards, Cochrane published the abstracts of those colloquia as supplements to the &quot;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews&quot;. From 2010 to 2016, an annual newsletter related to Cochrane methodology called &quot;Cochrane Methods&quot; (), was published as an annual supplement.

<text>Heat lightning (not to be confused with dry thunderstorms, which are also often called dry lightning) is a misnomer used for the faint flashes of lightning on the horizon or other clouds from distant thunderstorms that do not appear to have accompanying sounds of thunder.
The actual phenomenon that is sometimes called heat lightning is simply cloud-to-ground lightning that occurs very far away, with thunder that dissipates before it reaches the observer. At night, it is possible to see the flashes of lightning from very far distances, up to , but the sound does not carry that far. In the United States, lightning is especially common in Florida, which is considered the deadliest state for lightning strikes in the country. This is due to high moisture content in the lower atmosphere and high surface temperature, which produces strong sea breezes along the Florida coast. As a result, heat lightning is often seen over the water at night, the remnants of storms that formed during the day along a sea breeze front coming in from the opposite coast.

Heat lightning is not to be confused with electrically induced luminosity actually generated at mesospheric altitudes above thunderstorm systems (and likewise visible at exceedingly great ranges), a phenomenon known as &quot;sprites&quot;.

==Cloud-to-ground lightning==
The movement of sound in the atmosphere depends on the properties of the air, such as temperature and density. Because temperature and density change with height, the sound of thunder is refracted through the troposphere. This refraction results in spaces through which the thunder does not propagate. The sound of thunder often reflects off the Earth&#x27;s surface. The rumbling sound is partly due to these reflections. This reflection and refraction can leave voids where thunder cannot be heard.

Earth&#x27;s curvature also contributes to distant observers not hearing the thunderclap. Thunder is more likely to reflect off the Earth&#x27;s surface before it reaches an observer far from the strike, and only the right refraction and reflection of the sound off of the atmosphere will give it the range it needs to be heard far away. The reflection and refraction in the troposphere determines who hears the strike and who doesn&#x27;t. Usually, the troposphere will reflect the light, and leave out the sound - in these cases some fraction of the light emanating from distant thunderstorms (whose distant clouds may be so low to the horizon as to be essentially invisible) is scattered by the upper atmosphere and thus visible to remote observers.

Under optimum conditions, the most intense thunderstorms can be seen at up to over flat terrain or water when the clouds are illuminated by large lightning discharges. However, an upper limit of is more common due to topography, trees on the horizon, low to mid-level clouds, and the fact that local visibilities are generally no more than . The height of the anvil (the large, plume-like top of a thunderhead) also contributes— is very common in the mid latitudes for warm-season thunderstorms, but the anvil height can range from to a current record of .

<text>In mathematics, an indicator function or a characteristic function of a subset of a set is a function that maps elements of the subset to one, and all other elements to zero. That is, if is a subset of some set , then formula_1 if formula_2 and formula_3 otherwise, where formula_4 is one common notation for the indicator function; other common notations are formula_5 formula_6 and formula_7

The indicator function of is the Iverson bracket of the property of belonging to ; that is, 

formula_8

For example, the Dirichlet function is the indicator function of the rational numbers as a subset of the real numbers.

==Definition==
Given an arbitrary set , an indicator function of a subset for is defined by the function (::)

formula_9

or, more specifically by (::)

formula_10

The Iverson bracket provides the equivalent notation, formula_11 or that can be used instead of formula_12

The function formula_4 is sometimes denoted , , , or even just .

==Notation and terminology==
The notation formula_14 is also used to denote the characteristic function in convex analysis, which is defined as if using the reciprocal of the standard definition of the indicator function.

A related concept in statistics is that of a dummy variable. (This must not be confused with &quot;dummy variables&quot; as that term is usually used in mathematics, also called a bound variable.)

The term &quot;characteristic function&quot; has an unrelated meaning in classic probability theory. For this reason, traditional probabilists use the term indicator function for the function defined here almost exclusively, while mathematicians in other fields are more likely to use the term &quot;characteristic function&quot; to describe the function that indicates membership in a set.

In fuzzy logic and modern many-valued logic, predicates are the characteristic functions of a probability distribution. That is, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

==Basic properties==
The &quot;indicator&quot; or &quot;characteristic&quot; function of a subset of some set maps elements of to the codomain formula_15

This mapping is surjective only when is a non-empty proper subset of If formula_16 then formula_17 By a similar argument, if formula_18 then formula_19

If formula_20 and formula_21 are two subsets of formula_22 then
formula_23

and the indicator function of the complement of formula_20 i.e. formula_25 is:
formula_26

More generally, suppose formula_27 is a collection of subsets of . For any formula_28

formula_29

is clearly a product of s and s. This product has the value at precisely those formula_30 that belong to none of the sets formula_31 and is 0 otherwise. That is

formula_32

Expanding the product on the left hand side,

formula_33

where formula_34 is the cardinality of . This is one form of the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

As suggested by the previous example, the indicator function is a useful notational device in combinatorics. The notation is used in other places as well, for instance in probability theory: if is a probability space with probability measure formula_35 and is a measurable set, then formula_4 becomes a random variable whose expected value is equal to the probability of :

formula_37

This identity is used in a simple proof of Markov&#x27;s inequality.

In many cases, such as order theory, the inverse of the indicator function may be defined. This is commonly called the generalized Möbius function, as a generalization of the inverse of the indicator function in elementary number theory, the Möbius function. (See paragraph below about the use of the inverse in classical recursion theory.)

==Mean, variance and covariance==
Given a probability space formula_38 with formula_39 the indicator random variable formula_40 is defined by formula_41 if formula_42 otherwise formula_43

;Mean: formula_44 (also called &quot;Fundamental Bridge&quot;).

;Variance: formula_45

;Covariance: formula_46

==Characteristic function in recursion theory, Gödel&#x27;s and Kleene&#x27;s representing function==
Kurt Gödel described the &quot;representing function&quot; in his 1934 paper &quot;On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems&quot; (the symbol &quot;&quot; indicates logical inversion, i.e. &quot;NOT&quot;): 

Kleene offers up the same definition in the context of the primitive recursive functions as a function of a predicate takes on values if the predicate is true and if the predicate is false.

For example, because the product of characteristic functions formula_47 whenever any one of the functions equals , it plays the role of logical OR: IF formula_48 OR formula_49 OR ... OR formula_50 THEN their product is . What appears to the modern reader as the representing function&#x27;s logical inversion, i.e. the representing function is when the function is &quot;true&quot; or satisfied&quot;, plays a useful role in Kleene&#x27;s definition of the logical functions OR, AND, and IMPLY, the bounded- and unbounded- mu operators and the CASE function.

==Characteristic function in fuzzy set theory==
In classical mathematics, characteristic functions of sets only take values (members) or (non-members). In &quot;fuzzy set theory&quot;, characteristic functions are generalized to take value in the real unit interval , or more generally, in some algebra or structure (usually required to be at least a poset or lattice). Such generalized characteristic functions are more usually called membership functions, and the corresponding &quot;sets&quot; are called &quot;fuzzy&quot; sets. Fuzzy sets model the gradual change in the membership degree seen in many real-world predicates like &quot;tall&quot;, &quot;warm&quot;, etc.

==Smoothness==

In general, the indicator function of a set is not smooth; it is continuous if and only if its support is a connected component. In the algebraic geometry of finite fields, however, every affine variety admits a (Zariski) continuous indicator function. Given a finite set of functions formula_51 let formula_52 be their vanishing locus. Then, the function formula_53 acts as an indicator function for formula_54 If formula_55 then formula_56 otherwise, for some formula_57 we have formula_58 which implies that formula_59 hence formula_60

Although indicator functions are not smooth, they admit weak derivatives. For example, consider Heaviside step function formula_61 The distributional derivative of the Heaviside step function is equal to the Dirac delta function, i.e. formula_62
and similarly the distributional derivative of formula_63 is formula_64

Thus the derivative of the Heaviside step function can be seen as the &quot;inward normal derivative&quot; at the &quot;boundary&quot; of the domain given by the positive half-line. In higher dimensions, the derivative naturally generalises to the inward normal derivative, while the Heaviside step function naturally generalises to the indicator function of some domain . The surface of will be denoted by . Proceeding, it can be derived that the inward normal derivative of the indicator gives rise to a &quot;surface delta function&quot;, which can be indicated by formula_65:
formula_66
where is the outward normal of the surface . This &#x27;surface delta function&#x27; has the following property:
formula_67

By setting the function equal to one, it follows that the inward normal derivative of the indicator integrates to the numerical value of the surface area .

<text>Fray is an eight-issue comic book limited series, a futuristic spin-off of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Written by &quot;Buffy&quot; creator Joss Whedon, the series follows a Slayer named Melaka Fray, a chosen one in a time when vampires (called &quot;lurks&quot;) are returning to the slums of New York City, and the rich-poor divide is even greater. Volume one is drawn by Karl Moline (pencils) and Andy Owens (inks).

The series was published by Dark Horse Comics beginning in 2001, with delays between the first six and the final two issues caused by Whedon&#x27;s TV commitments, and Moline&#x27;s divided commitments illustrating &quot;Route 666&quot; for CrossGen Comics. After the series&#x27; conclusion in August 2003, a trade paperback collecting the whole series was also published by Dark Horse. In a short video promoting the charity Equality Now Joss Whedon confirmed that &quot;Fray is not done, Fray is coming back. More than that, I will not say.&quot; This was reiterated in 2007&#x27;s Comic Con when Whedon stated that he &quot;absolutely would be returning to that world.&quot; Fray next appears as a main character in the 2008 &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; crossover story arc, &quot;Time of Your Life&quot;, by Whedon and Moline.

The series was closely linked to the concurrently airing seventh season of &quot;Buffy&quot;, with coinciding depictions of the Slayer&#x27;s mystical scythe and her origins, a major contributor to the expansion of the canonical &quot;Buffyverse&quot; in which &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and other related stories are set. Melaka Fray also appears in the story &quot;Tales&quot;, by the same creative team as the series, in the anthology comic book &quot;Tales of the Slayers&quot;.

==Characters==
*Melaka &quot;Mel&quot; Fray – A 19-year-old thief and Vampire Slayer. Unlike other Slayers, she has had no prophetic dreams of her destiny or of the Slayers before her and is now trying to figure out what her destiny as the Slayer entails.
*Harth Fray – Mel&#x27;s twin brother, who was attacked by a vampire during a theft with Mel. To save his life, Harth deliberately drank the vampire&#x27;s blood, thereby becoming a vampire himself. It is unprecedented for a Slayer to have a twin and, as an odd side-effect of this, Harth possesses the prophetic dreams and visions of past Slayers that Mel lacks.
*Erin Fray – Mel&#x27;s older sister. On opposing sides already because of her job as a cop and Melaka&#x27;s thieving, Erin also blamed Mel for the death of their brother for a long time. Eventually, in the big battle against their vampire brother, the two reconciled.
*Urkonn – A demon who trains Mel as a Slayer in lieu of her actual Watcher (who instead immolates himself). A budding friendship grows from the previously harsh mentor-student relationship, but he ultimately betrays her by killing Loo in order to harden her resolve. After defeating her brother, Mel discovers Urkonn&#x27;s betrayal and lures him into a trap, killing him.
*Loo – Mel&#x27;s friend, a mutated girl, murdered by Urkonn in order to motivate Melaka in confronting her brother.
*Icarus – The vampire that killed Harth four years ago; killed by Erin right before the big battle.

==Synopsis==
The story is about a Vampire Slayer of the future named Melaka Fray and her discovery of what being a Slayer means.

Centuries have passed since the last Slayer was called. Demons were banished from the Earth at some point in the 21st century by an unnamed Slayer and her friends, and the Watchers&#x27; Council has decayed into a group of crazed fanatics. The vampires (dubbed &quot;lurks&quot;) have now returned and haunt the city. To combat this threat, a new Slayer is called: a professional thief named Melaka Fray. With the Watchers&#x27; Council ineffective, a group of &quot;neutral&quot; demons send the demon Urkonn to prepare Melaka for the war that is sure to come.

Although training hard and feeling confident, Mel finds herself out of her depth when she fights the vampire Icarus. Years before, Icarus severely injured Mel and killed her twin brother, Harth. Mel discovers that Harth was not actually killed: after being bitten by Icarus, he bit back and fed off the vampire, becoming a vampire himself. Since he was the Slayer&#x27;s twin, he has the visions and instinctive knowledge that should have been hers: he knew what Mel is long before she did, and also knew how to become a vampire.

Disheartened, Mel refuses to fight, until she discovers the body of her young friend, a girl named Loo, with her neck snapped. Determined to avenge her, Mel rallies the inhabitants of the slums to fight against the vampires. Police officer Erin Fray (Mel&#x27;s older sister) convinces some of the local law enforcement to also join in the crusade.

As the battle begins, a giant dragon-like demon flies over the scene. This, Urkonn tells Mel, is the gateway to the demon world, and thousands more demons will be born from its womb. Mel falls into the creature&#x27;s mouth, and manages to kill it from inside by stabbing its brain. She climbs out of the creature&#x27;s eye and again encounters Harth, who is riding on its back. His plans foiled, he kisses her on the mouth, and flees.

The world is safe, but one more piece of business remains. Mel tells Urkonn that she knows a vampire couldn&#x27;t have killed Loo: they couldn&#x27;t have got into her flat uninvited, and would have drained her blood, not snapped her neck. Therefore, Urkonn must have done it, hoping to inspire her to fight. He admits the truth, and they battle. Having figured out that her demon mentor can&#x27;t swim, Melaka drops him into a pool of water and stabs him in the head.

Melaka returns to her former life of crime, while at the same time killing any lurks she finds. In another world, Urkonn&#x27;s superiors state that he will be stricken from history for his failure to kill her after she stopped Harth, and start to discuss their plans for when Harth tries something again.

<text>Konstanz (or &quot;Constance&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the south of Baden-Württemberg on the German-Swiss border, situated along the shores of Lake Constance. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Schwarzwald-Baar, Tuttlingen, Sigmaringen and Bodenseekreis. To the south it borders the Swiss cantons of Zurich, Thurgau and Schaffhausen. The municipality of Büsingen am Hochrhein is an exclave of Germany surrounded by Swiss territory.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Bezirksamt Konstanz&quot;, which was created in 1806 when the area became part of Württemberg (since 1810 Baden). After some changes in its outline it was changed into the district in 1936, including part of the dissolved &quot;Bezirksamt Engen&quot;. 1939 the city Constance became district-free, but was reintegrated into the district in 1953. 1973 it was merged with the neighboring district Stockach and some municipalities from the districts Sigmaringen and Donaueschingen.

==Geography==
The district is located at the north-western shore of Lake Constance, in a landscape called &quot;Hegau&quot;. The World Heritage Site Reichenau Island, with its old monastery as well as the flower island Mainau, are part of the district. Also located in the district is the &quot;Aachtopf&quot; near the city Aach, the biggest spring in Germany by water volume. The spring actually contains water from the Danube which moves through karst caves underneath the European watershed.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms show a fish both in top left as well as the bottom right, representing the fishing industry in the Lake Constance. The cross in the top right is the symbol of the bishopric of Konstanz. The deer antlers in the bottom left were added after the district was merged with the district Stockach. These were taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Veringen-Nellenbach, and were present in the coat of arms of the district Stockach, as well as the city Stockach.

<doc id="240799" wikidata="Q3344539" url="?curid=240799" title="Mind share">
<text>Mind share relates to the development of consumer awareness or popularity, and is one of the main objectives of advertising and promotion. When people think of examples of a product type or category, they usually think of a limited number of brand names. The aim of mind share is to establish a brand as being one of the best kinds of a given product or service, and to even have the brand name become a synonym for the product or service offered. For example, a prospective buyer of a college education will have several thousand colleges to choose from. However, the evoked set, or set of schools considered, will probably be limited to about ten. Of these ten, the colleges that the buyer is most familiar with will receive the greatest attention.

Marketers and promoters of mind share try to maximize the popularity of their product, so that the brand co-exists with deeper, more empirical categories of objects. Kleenex, for example, can distinguish itself as a type of tissue. But, because it has gained popularity amongst consumers, it is frequently used as a term to identify any tissue, even if it is from a competing brand. Q-tips and band-aids would be other examples of this.

Popularity can be established to a greater or lesser degree depending on product and market. For example, in the Southern U.S. it is common to hear people refer to any cola-flavored soft drink as a &quot;coke&quot;, regardless of whether it is actually produced by Coca-Cola or not.

A legal risk of such popularity is that the name may become so widely accepted that it becomes a generic term and loses trademark protection. Examples include &quot;escalator&quot;, &quot;panadol&quot;, &quot;chapstick&quot;, &quot;tupperware&quot;, and &quot;bandaid&quot;. Companies will often attempt to prevent a product name from becoming generic to avoid losing trademark protection. Xerox Corporation attempted to prevent the genericization of its core trademark through an extensive public relations campaign advising consumers to &quot;photocopy&quot; instead of &quot;xerox&quot; documents.

Other objectives of mind share include short or long term increases in sales, market share, product information, and reputation.

<doc id="240808" wikidata="Q1248772" url="?curid=240808" title="Eastern copperhead">
<text>The eastern copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), also known simply as the copperhead, is a species of venomous snake, a pit viper, endemic to eastern North America; it is a member of the subfamily Crotalinae in the family Viperidae.

The eastern copperhead has distinctive, dark brown, hourglass-shaped markings, overlaid on a light reddish brown or brown/gray background. The body type is heavy, rather than slender. Neonates are born with green or yellow tail tips, which progress to a darker brown or black within one year. Adults grow to a typical length (including tail) of .

In most of North America, the eastern copperhead favors deciduous forest and mixed woodlands. It may occupy rock outcroppings and ledges, but is also found in low-lying, swampy regions. During the winter, it hibernates in dens or limestone crevices, often together with timber rattlesnakes and black rat snakes. The eastern copperhead is known to feed on a wide variety of prey, including invertebrates (primarily arthropods) and vertebrates. Like most pit vipers, the eastern copperhead is generally an ambush predator; it takes up a promising position and waits for suitable prey to arrive.

As a common species within its range, it may be encountered by humans. Unlike other viperids, it often &quot;freezes&quot; instead of slithering away and fleeing, due to its habit of relying on excellent camouflage. Bites occur due to people unknowingly stepping on or near them. Copperhead bites account for half of the treated snake bites in the United States.

Five subspecies have been recognized in the past, but recent genetic analysis had yielded new species information.

==Etymology==
Its generic name is derived from the Greek words &quot;ankistron&quot; &quot;hook, fishhook&quot; and &quot;odon&quot;, variant of &quot;odous&quot; &quot;tooth&quot;. The trivial name, or specific epithet, comes from the Latin &quot;contortus&quot; (twisted, intricate, complex), which is usually interpreted to reference the distorted pattern of darker bands across the snake&#x27;s back, which are broad at the lateral base, but &quot;pinched&quot; into narrow hourglass shapes in the middle at the vertebral area.

==Description==
 Adults grow to a typical length (including tail) of . Some may exceed , although that is exceptional for this species. Males do not typically exceed and weigh from , with a mean of roughly . Females do not typically exceed , and have a mean body mass of . The maximum length reported for this species is for &quot;A. c. mokasen&quot; (Ditmars, 1931). Brimley (1944) mentions a specimen of &quot;A. c. mokasen&quot; from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that was &quot;four feet, six inches&quot; (137.2 cm), but this may have been an approximation. The maximum length for &quot;A. c. contortrix&quot; is (Conant, 1958).

The body is relatively stout and the head is broad and distinct from the neck. Because the snout slopes down and back, it appears less blunt than that of the cottonmouth, &quot;A. piscivorus&quot;. Consequently, the top of the head extends further forward than the mouth.

The escalation includes 21–25 (usually 23) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 138–157 ventral scales in both sexes, and 38–62 and 37–57 subcaudal scales in males and females, respectively. The subcaudals are usually single, but the percentage thereof decreases clinally from the northeast, where about 80% are undivided, to the southwest of the geographic range where as little as 50% may be undivided. On the head are usually 9 large symmetrical plates, 6–10 (usually 8) supralabial scales, and 8–13 (usually 10) sublabial scales.

The color pattern consists of a pale tan to pinkish-tan ground color that becomes darker towards the foreline, overlaid with a series of 10–18 (13.4) crossbands. Characteristically, both the ground color and crossband pattern are pale in &quot;A. c. contortrix&quot;. These crossbands are light tan to pinkish-tan to pale brown in the center, but darker towards the edges. They are about two scales wide or less at the midline of the back, but expand to a width of 6–10 scales on the sides of the body. They do not extend down to the ventral scales. Often, the crossbands are divided at the midline and alternate on either side of the body, with some individuals even having more half bands than complete ones. A series of dark brown spots is also present on the flanks, next to the belly, and are largest and darkest in the spaces between the crossbands.

The belly is the same color as the ground color, but may be a little whitish in part. At the base of the tail are one to three (usually two) brown crossbands followed by a gray area. In juveniles, the pattern on the tail is more distinct: 7–9 crossbands are visible, while the tip is yellow. On the head, the crown is usually unmarked, except for a pair of small dark spots, one near the midline of each parietal scale. A faint postocular stripe is also present; diffuse above and bordered below by a narrow brown edge.

Several aberrant color patterns for &quot;A. c. contortrix&quot;, or populations that intergrade with it, have also been reported. In a specimen described by Livezey (1949) from Walker County, Texas, 11 of 17 crossbands were not joined middorsally, while on one side, three of the crossbands were fused together longitudinally to form a continuous, undulating band, surmounted above by a dark stripe that was 2.0–2.5 scales wide.

In another specimen, from Lowndes County, Alabama, the first three crossbands were complete, followed by a dark stripe that ran down either side of the body, with points of pigment reaching up to the midline in six places, but never getting there, after which the last four crossbands on the tail were also complete. A specimen found in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana had a similar striped pattern, with only the first and last two crossbands being normal.

==Distribution and habitat==
The eastern copperhead is found in North America; its range within the United States is in Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. In Mexico, it occurs in Chihuahua and Coahuila. The type locality is &quot;Carolina&quot;. Schmidt (1953) proposed the type locality be restricted to &quot;Charleston, South Carolina&quot;.

Unlike some other species of North American pit vipers, such as the timber rattlesnake and massasauga, the copperhead has mostly not re-established itself north of the terminal moraine after the last glacial period (the Wisconsin glaciation), though it is found in southeastern New York and southern New England, north of the Wisconsin glaciation terminal moraine on Long Island.

Eastern copperheads are habitat generalists which are species able to survive in different habitats (fragmented and unfragmented). Within its range, it occupies a variety of different habitats. In most of North America, it favors deciduous forest and mixed woodlands. It is often associated with rock outcroppings and ledges, but is also found in low-lying, swampy regions. During the winter, it hibernates in dens or limestone crevices, often together with timber rattlesnakes and black rat snakes. In the states around the Gulf of Mexico, however, this species is also found in coniferous forest. In the Chihuahuan Desert of West Texas and northern Mexico, it occurs in riparian habitats, usually near permanent or semipermanent water and sometimes in dry arroyos (brooks).

==Conservation status==
This species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v3.1, 2001). This means that relative to many other species, it is not at risk of extinction in the near future. The population trend was stable when assessed in 2007. Their venom has potential medicinal value to humans.

==Behavior==
In the Southern United States, copperheads are nocturnal during the hot summer, but are commonly active during the day during the spring and fall. Unlike other viperids, they often &quot;freeze&quot; instead of slithering away, and as a result, many bites occur due to people unknowingly stepping on or near them. This tendency to freeze most likely evolved because of the extreme effectiveness of their camouflage. When lying on dead leaves or red clay, they can be almost impossible to notice. They frequently stay still even when approached closely, and generally strike only if physical contact is made. Like most other New World vipers, copperheads exhibit defensive tail vibration behavior when closely approached. This species is capable of vibrating its tail in excess of 40 times per second— faster than almost any other nonrattlesnake snake species.

==Diet and feeding behavior==
The eastern copperhead is a diet generalist and is known to feed on a wide variety of prey, including invertebrates (primarily arthropods) and vertebrates. A generalized ontogenetic shift in the diet occurs, with juveniles feeding on higher percentages of invertebrates and ectotherms, and adults feeding on a higher percentage vertebrate endotherms. Both juveniles and adults, though, feed on invertebrates and vertebrates opportunistically. The diet is also known to vary among geographic populations.

Studies conducted at various locations within the range of the eastern copperhead (&quot;A. contortrix&quot;), including Tennessee, Kentucky, Kansas, and Texas, identified some consistently significant prey items included cicadas (&quot;Tibicen&quot;), caterpillars (Lepidoptera), lizards (&quot;Sceloporus&quot; and &quot;Scincella&quot;), voles (&quot;Microtus&quot;), and mice (&quot;Peromyscus&quot;). Accounts of finding large numbers of copperheads in bushes, vines, and trees seeking newly emerged cicadas, some as high as 40 feet above ground, have been reported from Texas by various herpetologists.

Other items documented in the diet include various invertebrates, e.g. millipedes (Diplopoda), spiders (Arachnida), beetles (Coleoptera), dragonflies (Odonata), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), and mantids (Mantidae), as well as numerous species of vertebrates, including salamanders, frogs, lizards, snakes, small turtles, small birds, young opossums, squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, bats, shrews, moles, rats, and mice.

Like most pit vipers, the eastern copperhead is generally an ambush predator; it takes up a promising position and waits for suitable prey to arrive. One exception to ambush foraging occurs when copperheads feed on insects such as caterpillars and freshly molted cicadas. When hunting insects, copperheads actively pursue their prey. They possess facial pit organs which is a complex infrared-imaging system that allows accurate and precise strikes on potential prey. Juveniles use a brightly colored tail to attract frogs and perhaps lizards, a behavior termed caudal luring (see video: ). Sight, odor, and heat detection are used in locating prey, although after the prey has been envenomated, odor and taste become the primary means of tracking. Smaller prey items and birds are often seized and held in the mouth until dead, while larger prey items are typically bitten, released, and then tracked until dead. Copperheads occasionally feed on carrion. females typically fast, although some individuals occasionally take small volumes of food. An individual may eat up to twice its body mass in a year. One study found an individual that ate eight times during an annual activity period, totaling 1.25 times its body mass.

Predators of the eastern copperhead are not well known, but may include owls, hawks, opossums, bullfrogs, and other snakes. They will use anti-predatory behaviors to discourage predators. These include: move away or flee, musking, tail vibrating, mouth gaping, or curling up into a camouflage pile.

==Reproduction==
Eastern copperheads breed in late summer, but not every year; sometimes, females produce young for several years running, then do not breed at all for a time. Mating is sometimes preceded by male combat. Females give birth to live young, each of which is about in total length. The typical litter size is four to seven, but as few as one, or as many as 20 may be seen. Females are capable of storing sperm for up to a year. Their size apart, the young are similar to the adults, but lighter in color, and with a yellowish-green-marked tip to the tail, which is used to lure lizards and frogs.

&quot;A. contortrix&quot; males have longer tongue tie lengths than females during the breeding season, which may aid in chemoreception of males searching for females.

===Facultative parthenogenesis===
Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. &quot;A. contortrix&quot; can reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, that is, they are capable of switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode. The type of parthenogenesis that likely occurs is automixis with terminal fusion, a process in which two terminal products from the same meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote. This process leads to genome-wide homozygosity, expression of deleterious recessive alleles, and often to developmental failure (inbreeding depression). Both captive-born and wild-born &quot;A. contortrix&quot; snakes appear to be capable of this form of parthenogenesis.

==Venom==
Although venomous, eastern copperheads are generally not aggressive and bites are rarely fatal. Copperhead venom has an estimated lethal dose around 100 mg, and tests on mice show its potency is among the lowest of all pit vipers, and slightly weaker than that of its close relative, the cottonmouth. Copperheads often employ a &quot;warning bite&quot; when stepped on or agitated and inject a relatively small amount of venom, if any at all. &quot;Dry bites&quot; involving no venom are particularly common with the copperhead, though all pit vipers are capable of a dry bite. The fangs of dead pit vipers are capable of delivering venom in amounts that necessitate the use of antivenom.

Bite symptoms include extreme pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling, and severe nausea. Damage can occur to muscle and bone tissue, especially when the bite occurs in the outer extremities such as the hands and feet, areas in which a large muscle mass is not available to absorb the venom. A bite from any venomous snake should be taken very seriously and immediate medical attention sought, as an allergic reaction and secondary infection are always possible.

The venom of the southern copperhead has been found to hold the protein &quot;contortrostatin&quot; that halts the growth of cancer cells in mice and also stops the migration of the tumors to other sites. However, this is an animal model, and further testing is required to verify safety and efficacy in humans.

The antivenom CroFab is used to treat copperhead envenomations that demonstrate localized or systemic reactions to the venom. As many copperhead bites can be dry (no envenomation), CroFab is not given in the absence of a reaction (such as swelling) due to the risk of complications of an allergic reaction to the treatment. The antivenom can cause an immune reaction called serum sickness. Pain management, tetanus immunization, laboratory evaluation, and medical supervision in the case of complications are additional courses of action. In 2002, an Illinois poison control center report on the availability of antivenom stated it used 1 Acp to 5 Acp depending on the symptoms and circumstances. Antivenom use however may not be necessary in the majority of cases, A study that analyzed 88 copperhead bite victims reported that all the victims survived and none required antivenom.

==Subspecies==

This species was long considered to contain five subspecies listed below, but gene analysis suggests that &quot;A. c. laticinctus&quot; represents its own distinct species, while &quot;A. c. mokasen&quot; and &quot;A. c. phaeogaster&quot; are regional variants of &quot;A. c. contortrix&quot;, and &quot;A. c. pictigaster&quot; is a regional variant of &quot;A. c. laticinctus&quot;.

Five subspecies have been recognized in the past, but recent genetic analysis shows that &quot;A c. contorix&quot; and two of the subspecies are monotypic, while &quot;Agkistrodon laticinctus&quot; (formerly &quot;Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus&quot;) and the fifth subspecies are a single distinct species.

<doc id="240819" wikidata="Q11682" url="?curid=240819" title="Justine Henin">
<text>Justine Henin (; born 1 June 1982) is a Belgian former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 117 weeks, including as the year-end No. 1 in 2003, 2006 and 2007. Henin won 43 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including seven majors (four at the French Open, two at the US Open and one at the Australian Open), as well as an Olympic gold medal at the 2004 Athens Games and two Tour Finals titles. Coming from a country with little success in the sport, Henin helped establish Belgium as a leading force in women&#x27;s tennis alongside Kim Clijsters, leading it to its first Fed Cup crown in 2001.

Henin was known for her all-court style of play and for being one of the few female players to use a single-handed backhand. Tennis experts cite her mental toughness, the completeness and variety of her game, her footspeed and footwork, and her one-handed backhand (which all-time great John McEnroe described as &quot;the best single-handed backhand in both the women&#x27;s or men&#x27;s game&quot;) as the principal reasons for her success. She retired from professional tennis on 26 January 2011, due to a chronic elbow injury.

Henin is widely considered one of the greatest tennis players of her generation and of all time. In June 2011, she was named one of the &quot;30 Legends of Women&#x27;s Tennis: Past, Present and Future&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;. In 2016, she became the first Belgian tennis player inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and in 2023, the International Tennis Federation awarded Henin its highest honor, the Philippe Chatrier Award.

== Early life ==
Justine Henin, occasionally spelled Hénin, was born in Liège to José Henin and Françoise Rosière. Rosière, a French and history teacher, died when Justine was 12 years old. She has two brothers and a sister. When she was two years old, Justine&#x27;s family moved to a house in Rochefort, situated next to the local tennis club, where she played tennis for the first time.

Henin&#x27;s mother routinely took the young Henin across the border to France to watch the French Open. In 1995, shortly after her mother&#x27;s death, Henin met her coach Carlos Rodríguez who guided her career both before her retirement in 2008 and during her 2010 comeback.

== Tennis career ==
=== Early career ===
Henin, known as &quot;Juju&quot; to many of her fans, was coached by Carlos Rodríguez of Argentina. In 1997, she won the junior girls&#x27; singles title at the French Open. Early in her junior career, she regularly reached the late rounds of international competitions and won five International Tennis Federation (ITF) tournaments by the end of 1998.

Junior Slam results:

* Australian Open: –
* French Open: W (1997)
* Wimbledon: QF (1997)
* US Open: QF (1997)

She began her professional career on the Women&#x27;s world Tennis Association tour in May 1999 as a wild card entry in the Belgian Open clay tournament at Antwerp and became only the fifth player to win her debut WTA Tour event. She also won her hometown event, the Liège Challenger, in July 2000.

Henin established herself as a major competitor in 2001, consequently reaching the women&#x27;s singles semifinals of the French Open and then upset the reigning Australian Open and French Open champion Jennifer Capriati in the semifinals of Wimbledon, losing to defending champion Venus Williams in three sets in the final. By the end of the year, Henin was ranked 7th in singles, with three titles to her name. Also that year, she reached the French Open women&#x27;s doubles semifinals with Elena Tatarkova and helped Belgium to win the 2001 Fed Cup.
Moreover, Henin played for the German tennis club Weiß-Blau Schweinfurt in 2001.

In 2002, she reached four WTA finals, winning two of them, and finished the year ranked world No. 5. Her German Open victory, her first win at a Tier I tournament, was noteworthy as she beat Jennifer Capriati in a semifinal and Serena Williams in the final, the then No. 2 and No. 5 ranked players, respectively. At Wimbledon 2002, Henin beat former world No. 1, Monica Seles, in two tough sets.

=== 2003: Ascent to No. 1 ===
Henin started the year as the 5th-ranked player in the world but lost to Kim Clijsters in the semifinals of the Medibank International in Sydney. In the fourth round of the Australian Open in Melbourne, she defeated Lindsay Davenport 7–5, 5–7, 9–7. In a match lasting more than three hours, Henin overcame a 4–1 final set deficit, high temperatures, and muscle cramps to defeat Davenport for the first time in her career. She then lost to Venus Williams in the semifinals in straight sets.

Henin also lost to Clijsters in the semifinals of the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp. At the Dubai Tennis Championships one week later, she defeated Monica Seles in the final 4–6, 7–6, 7–5 after Seles had a match point at 5–4 in the second set.

Henin&#x27;s next tournament was the Tier I Miami Masters. She lost in the quarterfinals to world No. 10, Chanda Rubin, 6–3, 6–2.

At the clay court Family Circle Cup in Charleston, South Carolina, Henin defeated world No. 1 Serena Williams in the final. This was Williams&#x27; first loss of the year after 21 wins.

The following week, Henin reached the semifinals of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Florida, losing to eventual winner Elena Dementieva 3–6, 6–4, 7–5. Henin then helped Belgium defeat Austria 5–0 in a first round tie of the Fed Cup.

In May, Henin successfully defended her title at the German Open in Berlin. In the final, she saved three match points in the third set before defeating Clijsters.
At the French Open, she was the fourth seeded player and defeated the defending champion, Serena Williams, in a controversial semifinal 6–2, 4–6, 7–5 which saw Henin asked to acknowledge her raised hand during a Williams service motion. In the final, Henin defeated Clijsters in straight sets. This was her first Grand Slam title, and she was the first Belgian ever to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Henin then began her preparations for Wimbledon. At the grass court Ordina Open in Rosmalen, she lost in the final to Clijsters; she was forced to retire from the match after injuring her finger. At Wimbledon, Henin was the third seeded player. She defeated Mary Pierce in the fourth round and Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals before losing to Serena Williams in straight sets.

Henin&#x27;s first competition after Wimbledon was the Fed Cup tie against Slovakia. She won both her singles matches to help Belgium win the tie 5–0 and begin her 22-match winning streak. She then played two tournaments during the North American summer hard court season before the US Open. At the Tier I Acura Classic in San Diego, the third-seeded Henin defeated the top-seeded Clijsters in the final. Henin was accused of poor sportsmanship by Kim Clijsters. Two weeks later at the Tier I Rogers Cup in Toronto, she defeated Russia&#x27;s Lina Krasnoroutskaya in the final.

Henin was the second-seeded player at the US Open. She won her first four matches against unseeded players before defeating seventh-seeded Anastasia Myskina in the quarterfinals and then defeated sixth-seeded Jennifer Capriati in the semifinals 4–6, 7–5, 7–6(4) in a match that lasted more than three hours and stretched to midnight. Henin recovered from a 3–5 deficit in the second set and a 2–5 deficit in the final set and was just two points from defeat eleven times. She was treated for muscle cramps and dehydration overnight but returned to play in the final the next day. In the final, Henin defeated Clijsters in straight sets. The win raised Henin&#x27;s ranking to world No. 2, just behind Clijsters.

At her next event, the indoor Sparkassen Cup in Leipzig, she lost to Myskina in the final. This ended Henin&#x27;s 22-match winning streak. Two weeks later at the indoor Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Filderstadt, Henin lost in the final to Clijsters. Had she won this match, she would have immediately replaced Clijsters as the world No. 1.

At the Tier I Zurich Open the following week, Henin reached her sixth consecutive final where she defeated Serbia&#x27;s Jelena Dokić. This win catapulted her to become the 13th world No. 1 on the WTA computer rankings on 20 October 2003. Henin temporarily lost her number 1 ranking after a week as she declined to defend her title at the Generali Ladies Linz tournament.

At the season-ending WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles, Henin defeated Myskina and Capriati and lost to Japan&#x27;s Ai Sugiyama in her round robin matches, which was sufficient to advance and return to the top spot on the WTA ranking. In the semifinals, she lost to Amélie Mauresmo 6–7(2), 6–3, 3–6, but managed to close a season ranked world No. 1 for the first time.

Henin was named the ITF&#x27;s women&#x27;s singles World Champion for 2003.

=== 2004: Australian Open and Olympic gold ===

Henin started 2004 by winning a warm-up tournament in Sydney and then the Australian Open in Melbourne, defeating Clijsters in three sets in the final.
By the end of 2004&#x27;s spring hard court season, Henin had built a 25-match Tier I win streak and 22–1 win–loss record, winning her first 16 matches.

At the start of the spring clay court season, Henin&#x27;s health was adversely affected by infection with a strain of cytomegalovirus and an immune system problem. She often slept up to 18 hours a day but barely had the strength to brush her teeth, let alone play competitive tennis.

Although Henin decided to defend her French Open title and was seeded first in the tournament, she lost her second round match to a much lower-ranked player, Tathiana Garbin of Italy. At the time, the loss marked only the second time in 15 Grand Slam events that she had lost before the fourth round.

After months of layoff because of a virus, Henin returned to competition in August and won the women&#x27;s singles gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Athens, defeating Amélie Mauresmo in the final 6–3, 6–3. Henin reached the gold medal match by defeating reigning French Open champion Anastasia Myskina in a semifinal 7–5, 5–7, 8–6 after having trailed 1–5 in the final set. Her medal ceremony was attended by fellow countryman and IOC president Jacques Rogge.

In September, she was unsuccessful in her defence of her US Open title, losing to Nadia Petrova in the fourth round. This defeat caused her to lose the world No. 1 ranking, which she had held for 45 non-consecutive weeks. She then withdrew from the ten remaining tournaments of the year in an effort to recover her health and improve her fitness.

=== 2005: Second French Open and injuries ===
Her plan to rejoin the tour at the beginning of 2005 was delayed when she fractured her kneecap in a December 2004 training session.

On 25 March, after more than six months away from competition, Henin returned to the WTA tour at the Miami Masters. She lost to second ranked Maria Sharapova in a quarterfinal. She rebounded at her next tournament, winning the clay court Family Circle Cup in Charleston. She won two more clay court titles before the start of the French Open. Her victories over top-ranked Lindsay Davenport, Sharapova, Elena Dementieva, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Petrova made her a top contender for the title there.

Henin was seeded tenth at the French Open and defeated the French player Mary Pierce in the final in straight sets to take her second title at Roland Garros. The win marked Henin&#x27;s 24th consecutive clay court win and her tenth consecutive final win, a streak dating back to Zurich in October 2003. In capturing the title, she defeated Kuznetsova in the fourth round, Sharapova in a quarterfinal, and Petrova in a semifinal. Henin saved two match points to defeat Kuznetsova in the fourth round 7–6(6), 4–6, 7–5 and thus became only the second woman to win the French Open after saving a match point.

With her French Open victory, Henin moved from world No. 12 to No. 7 in the women&#x27;s singles rankings. She was a perfect 24–0 on clay this year and joined Monica Seles as the only two currently active (in 2005) players on the WTA Tour to have won the French Open at least twice.

At Wimbledon, her win streak of 24 matches was snapped in the first round by Greek Eleni Daniilidou 7–6, 2–6, 7–5. It was the first time that a reigning French Open champion failed to win a match at Wimbledon. A hamstring injury sustained earlier in the year eventually limited her to playing only 11 more matches for 2005.

Henin next played the Rogers Cup in Toronto, where she reached the final after beating Mauresmo in a semifinal before losing to Clijsters in straight sets. She lost in the fourth round of the US Open to eventual finalist Mary Pierce 3–6, 4–6. Following this, she played in Filderstadt, but after losing her first round match to Flavia Pennetta, she decided not to play for the rest of 2005.

TENNIS Magazine placed her in 31st place on its list of that year of the 40 Greatest Players for the period 1965 through 2005.

In November, at the Tour Championships, she was named the inaugural winner of the Whirlpool 6th Sense Player of the Year, which honors the player who has demonstrated the most sixth sense intuition, that is to say &quot;heightened intelligence, unbeatable performance and pinpoint precision&quot;.

=== 2006: All four Slam finals ===
In January, Henin returned to competitive tennis at the tournament in Sydney, a tune-up for the Australian Open. She was seeded fifth and played former world No. 1 (and newly returned to competitive tennis) Martina Hingis in a much hyped first round match. Henin won 6–3, 6–3.

At the Australian Open, Henin defeated top-ranked Lindsay Davenport and fourth ranked Maria Sharapova in three-set matches to set up a final against third ranked Amélie Mauresmo. While trailing 6–1, 2–0, Henin retired from the match, citing intense stomach pain caused by over-use of anti-inflammatories for a persistent shoulder injury. Henin stated afterwards that she feared possible injury had she continued to play. Henin was criticized by the press because she had stated after her semifinal win against Sharapova that she was at the &quot;peak of her fitness&quot; and was playing the &quot;best tennis of her life&quot;. This was only the fourth time that a Grand Slam women&#x27;s singles final ended by retirement since 1900, and the first ever during the open era.

Henin captured her second title of the year at the Tier II event in Dubai defeating Sharapova 7–5, 6–2. This was her third Dubai title, having won previously in 2003 and 2004. At Tier I Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Henin lost in the semifinals to fourth-seeded Elena Dementieva 6–2, 5–7, 5–7, after leading 6–2, 5–2 and serving for the match twice. Henin also lost in the second round of Tier I Miami Masters to Meghann Shaughnessy 5–7, 4–6.

On clay, she failed to retain her title at the Family Circle Cup, losing in the semifinals to third-seeded Patty Schnyder 6–2, 3–6, 2–6. It was her first career defeat at this tournament and the end of her 27-match winning streak on clay. Henin then helped Belgium defeat defending champion Russia in a Fed Cup quarterfinal. She beat fifth ranked Nadia Petrova 6–7, 6–4, 6–3, and 9th ranked Elena Dementieva 6–2, 6–0. Petrova had come into the tie with two consecutive clay court tournament victories and a ten-match clay court winning streak, while Dementieva had defeated Henin in their last meeting in Indian Wells and defeated second ranked Belgian compatriot Kim Clijsters on the first day of the tie. Three weeks later, Henin played the Tier I Qatar Telecom German Open, defeating Mauresmo in the semifinal 6–1, 6–2 before losing to Petrova in a three-set final.

At the French Open, Henin defeated second seeded Clijsters in the semifinals 6–3, 6–2. She then defeated Kuznetsova in the final to win her third French Open singles title in four years. Henin captured the title without losing a set and became the first French Open champion to defend her title successfully since Steffi Graf in 1996.

At the Eastbourne grass court tournament just before Wimbledon, Henin defeated Anastasia Myskina in the final in three sets.

Henin was the third seed going into Wimbledon and advanced to her third consecutive Grand Slam final without losing a set. She defeated Clijsters (who was seeded second) in a semifinal 6–4, 7–6(4) but lost the final to Mauresmo. The final featured two finesse players who used their all-court games, a break from recent years that featured a succession of power baseliners claiming the title. At almost every point throughout the match, both players approached the net to volley. Tipped as the tournament favorite, Henin won the first set. But Mauresmo recovered to win the next two sets and her second Grand Slam singles title and deny the Belgian a career Grand Slam. This was the only Wimbledon final of the decade that did not involve Venus and/or Serena Williams.

Henin withdrew from Tier I events in San Diego and Montreal because of injury but played the tournament in New Haven. There, she defeated Kuznetsova and Davenport en route to the title. It was her 28th WTA tour title. She returned to the world No. 2 ranking and crossed over US$12 million in career prize money.

At the US Open, Maria Sharapova defeated Henin in the final after Henin had defeated Lindsey Davenport in the quarterfinals and Jelena Janković in the semifinals. Henin became the first woman since Hingis in 1997 to reach the finals of all four Grand Slam singles tournaments in a calendar year.

Henin won both of her singles matches during the Fed Cup final against Italy in Charleroi. However, Henin retired from the deciding doubles match because of a knee injury while she and her partner Kirsten Flipkens were trailing 3–6, 6–2, 2–0, giving Italy the championship.

Henin guaranteed her year-end world No. 1 ranking by reaching the final of the Sony Ericsson Championships, defeating Maria Sharapova in the semifinals 6–2, 7–6(5). Henin then defeated Mauresmo and won the tournament for the first time in her career.

Henin was the first player since Hingis in 2000 to win the WTA Tour Championships and end the year as the top-ranked player. Henin was the first woman to win at least one Grand Slam singles title in four consecutive years since Steffi Graf from 1993 through 1996. Her prize money earnings for the year totaled $4,204,810.

=== 2007: Dominance ===
On 4 January 2007, Henin withdrew from the Australian Open and the warm-up tournament in Sydney to deal with the break-up of her marriage. Not playing those tournaments caused Henin to lose the world No. 1 ranking to Maria Sharapova.

In Henin&#x27;s first tournament of the year, she lost in the semifinals of the Open Gaz de France in Paris to Czech Lucie Šafářová 6–7(5), 4–6. She then won two hardcourt tournaments in the Middle East, the Dubai Duty Free Women&#x27;s Open (for the fourth time in five years) over Amélie Mauresmo and her first Qatar Total Open title, defeating Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final. She also reached US$14 million in career prize money and on 19 March, regained the world No. 1 ranking.

At the Miami Masters, Henin reached the final for the first time in her career, where she lost to Serena Williams 6–0, 5–7, 3–6 after holding two match points at 6–0, 5–4. Her next tournament was the J&amp;S Cup in Warsaw, which she won, beating Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine in the final, 6–1, 6–3. Later, at the Qatar Telecom German Open in Berlin, Henin won her quarterfinal against Jelena Janković 3–6, 6–4, 6–4 after being behind 4–0 in the third set, only to lose her semifinal against Kuznetsova 4–6, 7–5, 4–6. The loss was only her second to Kuznetsova in 16 career meetings.

At the French Open, Henin was the two-time defending champion and top seed. In a highly anticipated quarterfinal match against Serena Williams, Henin won 6–4, 6–3. She then defeated Janković in the semifinals 6–2, 6–2. In the final, Henin defeated Ana Ivanovic in straight sets, 6–1, 6–2 to claim her third consecutive French Open title, equalling Seles&#x27;s open era record. She also surpassed US$15 million in career prize money earnings. Henin won the tournament without dropping a set and had not lost a set at this tournament since the 2005 French Open quarterfinals. She had not lost a match at the French Open since 2004. This proved to be the last successful women&#x27;s singles title defense at the French Open in next 16 years, until Iga Świątek defended her title in 2023.

The International Women&#x27;s Open in Eastbourne was Henin&#x27;s first grass court tournament of the year. She and Mauresmo reached the final, which was the first time in nearly 30 years that the Eastbourne final included both finalists from Wimbledon the previous year. Henin recovered from a breakdown in the final set to win in a third-set tiebreak for the second consecutive year.

At Wimbledon, Henin lost to Marion Bartoli in the semifinals 6–1, 5–7, 1–6, one day after Henin defeated Serena Williams in the quarterfinals. It was Henin&#x27;s first win over the American on a surface other than clay. In the semifinal, she was up a break at 1–0 and 4–3 in the second set, but could not hold the lead.

In August, Henin won the Tier I Rogers Cup in Toronto, defeating Janković in the final. The tournament championship was her 35th on the WTA tour, moving her past Clijsters who retired with 34 tournament championships.

At the US Open, Henin defeated her first four opponents in straight sets, with a 6–0 set in each match. Henin then faced Serena Williams in the quarterfinals for the third consecutive time in a Grand Slam tournament, and for the third time, Henin won, 7–6(3), 6–1. In the semifinals against Venus Williams, Henin was up a break in the first set but could not hold it. She finally won the set in a tiebreak. In the second set, Henin was ahead 3–0 before Williams leveled the set at 3–3. Williams then had three break points on Henin&#x27;s service but could not convert and lost the game. Henin then broke Williams&#x27;s serve and held her own serve to go up 5–3. Williams then broke Henin to pull within 5–4 but Henin broke Williams again in the last game to win the match 7–6(2), 6–4. Henin became only the second player to defeat both Williams sisters in the same Grand Slam tournament (after Martina Hingis at the 2001 Australian Open). In the final, Henin won her second US Open singles title, defeating Kuznetsova in straight sets, 6–1, 6–3. Henin won the tournament without dropping a set. She thus became the first women ever to defeat both Williams sisters in the same Grand Slam tournament, and go on to also win the title (Hingis had lost to Jennifer Capriati in the final of the 2001 Australian Open).

Henin won her next tournament, the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, defeating Tatiana Golovin in the final. Two weeks later, Henin won the Zurich Open, her ninth title of the year, by again defeating Golovin in the final.

At the WTA Tour Championships, Henin won all three of her round robin matches, defeating Anna Chakvetadze, Janković, and Bartoli. Going into the match against Bartoli, Henin had won 22 consecutive matches since Bartoli defeated her in the 2007 Wimbledon semifinals. Although Henin had already clinched a spot in the semifinals, both Henin and Bartoli did not know Bartoli had to replace Serena Williams until several hours before the match and lost 6–0, 6–0. In the semifinals, Henin defeated Ivanovic 6–4, 6–4. In the final, Henin overcame Sharapova in three sets in a match that lasted 3 hours, 24 minutes. Sharapova won the first set on her eighth set point in the 12-minute last game. Henin won the match on her fifth match point in the final game of the match. This was Henin&#x27;s longest ever match, the longest final in tournament history, and the twelfth longest women&#x27;s match ever.

This victory extended Henin&#x27;s winning streak to 25 matches. She only lost three sets after Wimbledon. This victory made her the sixth player to successfully defend her title at the WTA&#x27;s season-ending championship and the first player to claim at least ten tour titles in a year since Hingis won twelve in 1997. She also became the first woman to break the US$5 million barrier in prize money in a year, and by crossing US$19 million, Henin is now ranked fifth on the all time prize money list.

Henin ended the year ranked world No. 1 for the third time in her career, having done so previously in 2003 and 2006. She was the first player since Lindsay Davenport to end the year ranked world No. 1 consecutively for two years (Davenport was ranked year-end world No. 1 in 2004–2005). She also ended the year with a 63–4 record, having lost to only four players: Lucie Šafářová, Serena Williams, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Marion Bartoli. Her winning percentage of 94% was the best since Steffi Graf&#x27;s 1995 season (Serena Williams surpassed her in 2013 with 95%).

=== 2008: Retirement ===

Henin started the year as the world No. 1. 14 January marked Henin&#x27;s 100th career week as world No. 1, and on 10 March, Henin became only the seventh female player to be ranked world No. 1 for 12 consecutive months.

The Medibank International in Sydney was Henin&#x27;s first tournament of the year. She defeated Ana Ivanovic in the semifinals 6–2, 2–6, 6–4. She then defeated world No. 2, Svetlana Kuznetsova, 4–6, 6–2, 6–4, overcoming an 0–3 deficit in the final set.

At the Australian Open in Melbourne, Henin won her 32nd consecutive match in the fourth round, defeating Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan 6–2, 6–2. The winning streak ended in the quarterfinals when Sharapova, the eventual winner, defeated Henin 6–4, 6–0. This was Henin&#x27;s first 6–0 loss since the 2002 French Open and the first time since the 2005 US Open that Henin had been defeated in Grand Slam singles before the semifinals.

At the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp, Henin defeated Karin Knapp in the final. This was Henin&#x27;s second singles title in her native Belgium. Two weeks later at the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships, Henin was the defending champion but lost for the first time in eight meetings to Francesca Schiavone in the quarterfinals 7–6(3), 7–6(4). Henin had struggled for three hours in her first match against Katarina Srebotnik, eventually winning 7–5, 6–7, 6–3.

After taking a four-week break, Henin&#x27;s next tournament was the Miami Masters. She lost in the quarterfinals to Serena Williams 2–6, 0–6. Henin then withdrew from the Tier I Family Circle Cup because of an injury to her right knee.

At the Tier I, clay court Qatar Telecom German Open in Berlin, Henin lost in the third round to Dinara Safina 7–5, 3–6, 1–6, in what turned out to be her last match before retirement. In their five previous career matches, Henin had never lost a set to Safina. The day after her defeat, Henin withdrew from the Tier I Internazionali BNL d&#x27;Italia in Rome, citing fatigue.

Henin announced her immediate retirement from professional tennis on 14 May 2008, and requested the WTA to remove her name from the rankings immediately. Her announcement was a surprise because Henin was still ranked world No. 1 and was considered the favorite for the French Open, where she would have been the three-time defending champion. She said she felt no sadness about her retirement because she believed it was a release from a game she had focused on for twenty years. She also said that in the future, she would be concentrating on charity and her tennis school.

=== 2010: Comeback ===
Belgian newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; reported on Tuesday 22 September 2009 that Henin would formally announce her return to competitive tennis after 16 months of retirement. Later that day, she confirmed her return to competition.
Henin mentioned seeing Roger Federer finally complete the grand slam of titles by winning the French Open in 2009 had been an inspiration, as had Kim Clijsters&#x27; return to the tour and her victory at the US Open.

Henin made her return to tennis at the Brisbane International where she was given a wildcard. She defeated No. 2 seed Nadia Petrova, Sesil Karatantcheva, No. 7 seed Melinda Czink and No. 3 seed Ana Ivanovic to make it to the final. She then nearly won, losing to her compatriot Clijsters in a riveting final, 3–6, 6–4, 6–7(6) lasting 2 hours, 23 minutes. At one point, Henin was up 3–0 in the third set before Clijsters rallied and took the match to a tie break. Down 1–5 in the tiebreak, she fought back to 6-all before Clijsters took the final two points.

At the 2010 Australian Open, Henin was given a wildcard as an unranked player. Henin started off with a straight sets victory over Belgian Kirsten Flipkens. She set up a second round match of the tournament with No. 5 seed Elena Dementieva, whom she defeated 7–5, 7–6(5). Lasting two hours and fifty minutes, commentators felt this match was worthy of a final. Henin approached the net forty-three times, winning thirty-five of those points. In the third round, she defeated No. 28 seed Alisa Kleybanova from Russia; where she made a comeback to win 3–6, 6–4, 6–2. In the fourth round she faced World No. 16 and fellow Belgian, Yanina Wickmayer, defeating her in three sets 7–6, 1–6, 6–3. She then defeated No. 19 seed Nadia Petrova in the quarterfinals. Henin won 7–6, 7–5 after having been down 0–3 in the second set. She then went on to defeat Zheng Jie from China in the semifinals in convincing fashion 6–1, 6–0, setting up a clash with world No. 1 Serena Williams in the 2010 Australian Open ladies&#x27; final. This was the first time in their long rivalry that Henin and Serena Williams met in a Grand Slam final. Henin would eventually fall to Serena Williams in three sets 6–4, 3–6, 6–2.

A wildcard was granted for Henin to compete at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, a Premier Mandatory tournament. In the first round, Henin defeated Magdaléna Rybáriková 6–2, 6–2 in a little over an hour. Henin then lost to Gisela Dulko, 2–6, 6–1, 4–6, in a two-hour match. The result gave her a new rank of world No. 33 as of 22 March 2010.
She defeated Jill Craybas of US 6–2, 6–2 in the first round of Sony Ericsson Open. In the second round, Henin defeated world No. 6, Elena Dementieva, 6–3, 6–2 in 90 minutes. In the third round, Henin defeated Dominika Cibulková in 93 minutes, 6–4, 6–4 advancing to the quarterfinals where Henin beat Vera Zvonareva 6–1, 6–4 to set up a meeting in the quarterfinals with world No. 2, Caroline Wozniacki. After defeating Wozniacki in a three-set match, she fell to Kim Clijsters in a semifinal battle, 2–6, 7–6(3), 6–7(6). Following her Sony Ericsson Open performance, Henin moved into the top 25 for the first time since her comeback.

Henin&#x27;s next tournament was the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart. Henin played through this tournament injured, having previously broken her left pinkie during Fed Cup practice. In the first round, Henin saw off German qualifier Julia Görges 7–6(3), 6–1. In her second round, she defeated world No. 12 and fellow Belgian Yanina Wickmayer, defeating her for the 2nd consecutive time, 6–3, 7–5. In the quarterfinals, she defeated fourth seed and world No. 7 Jelena Janković 3–6, 7–6(4), 6–3 for the tenth time in her career. She defeated world No. 20 Shahar Pe&#x27;er in the semifinals, 6–3, 6–2, and reached her third final in five tournaments this year. She faced world No. 10 Samantha Stosur. Henin won the final 6–4, 2–6, 6–1 in 100 minutes, to procure her first title in 2010 (in her 3rd final). Winning this tournament also sent Henin into the top 20 for the first time since her comeback.

At the Madrid Open she was defeated in the first round by eventual champion Aravane Rezaï 4–6, 7–5, 6–0. As a result of this loss, Henin dropped out of the top 20 to No. 23. Henin then participated at the French Open, seeded 22nd, the second grand slam of the year where she had won four previous titles. In the 1st round, she defeated Tsvetana Pironkova in 89 minutes, 6–4, 6–3. In the second round, Henin faced Klára Zakopalová and defeated her 6–3, 6–3. In the third round, facing former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova, Henin ended her streak of consecutive sets at 40, losing the 2nd set to Sharapova but going on to win 6–2, 3–6, 6–3. She had then tied the number of consecutive sets won at the French Open with Helen Wills Moody. She lost to world No. 7 Samantha Stosur 6–2, 1–6, 4–6 in the fourth round, her first defeat at Roland Garros since 2004.

Henin began the grass court season at the UNICEF Open, where she was the top seed for the first time since her return. In the first three rounds she defeated Angelique Kerber, Roberta Vinci, and Kristina Barrois in straight sets. She then beat No. 5 seed Alexandra Dulgheru in the semifinals, 6–2, 6–2. In the final, she defeated No. 7 seed Andrea Petkovic to win her 43rd career title and second of the year.

At the Wimbledon Championships, Henin was the No. 17 seed. In the third round, she had a victory over Nadia Petrova, winning 6–1, 6–4. She was eventually defeated in the fourth round by Kim Clijsters 2–6, 6–2, 6–3, after convincingly winning the first set. Midway through the first set, Henin slipped on the court, injuring her right elbow. Further examinations revealed a partial ligament fracture in her elbow, causing her to end her 2010 season prematurely. She was awarded the WTA Comeback Player of the Year award in December for her 2010 season.

=== 2011: Second retirement ===

Henin started her season at the Hopman Cup. She did not lose any sets in the competition, earning comfortable victories over Alicia Molik from Australia, Sesil Karatantcheva from Kazakhstan, Ana Ivanovic of Serbia and Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the US in the final.

Henin was the 11th seed and a defending finalist at the Australian Open. Henin defeated Sania Mirza from India in the first round 5–7, 6–3, 6–1 and Elena Baltacha in the second, 6–1, 6–3. She then fell to 23rd seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, 4–6, 6–7(8).

On 26 January 2011, Henin announced her definitive retirement from professional tennis, due to an exacerbation of the elbow injury she sustained the previous year at Wimbledon.

== Playing style ==

At the 2007 French Open, Martina Navratilova said that &quot;Henin&#x27;s offense is just phenomenal ... it&#x27;s sort of like we&#x27;ve got &#x27;the female Federer&#x27;, or maybe the guys have &#x27;the male Justine Henin&#x27;, because she is just head and shoulders above everyone else right now.&quot; Her footwork, balance, and court coverage—and she is adept at changing from a defensive style to an aggressive one.
Compared to the rest of her game, Henin&#x27;s serve was rather inconsistent. Her tendency to take risks on her second serve could sometimes result in a high number of double faults. When she first came onto the tour, Henin used a pinpoint stance (most common among the WTA) for serving, but later retooled her serve to use a platform stance, which is most common among male players. Nonetheless, despite her relatively small size, Henin was capable of producing powerful first serves, her fastest one being clocked at at the 2005 Family Circle Cup. Henin&#x27;s single-handed backhand was the most powerful and accurate in the game. She could hit her backhand flat, with heavy topspin, or slice [underspin]. Her backhand could also be used to surprise her opponents with drop shots, breaking up the pattern of a groundstroke rally. Her forehand was generally regarded as her most dangerous weapon, and the stroke that she normally used to dictate play in a match. It was underrated as most only spoke of her backhand, but particularly in her dominant years of 2003 and 2007, she would dominate the tone of matches with her huge and versatile forehand.

A notable aspect of Henin&#x27;s playing style was the completeness of her game—the variety and versatility she had. Her style was often compared to that of Roger Federer and to five-time Grand Slam winner Martina Hingis as well. Four-time Grand Slam winner Kim Clijsters commented &quot;Growing up together, she&#x27;s always been the more touchy player. She has good hands ... she has those quick hands.&quot; Former world No. 1 Andy Roddick praised Henin&#x27;s and Hingis&#x27;s racket skills, saying &quot;She has probably the best racket skills of any female player I’ve seen, maybe her [Hingis] and Justine.&quot; Hingis herself also similarly said &quot;Players were better educated [during my career]. Now it&#x27;s sheer power. You kind of miss the players like myself or Justine Henin.&quot;

=== One-handed (topspin) backhand ===

In an era where two-handed backhands have become increasingly more popular due to their greater power and control, albeit at the expense of reach and shot variety, Henin possessed one of the best one-handed backhands to have ever played the sport of tennis. Her one-handed topspin backhand was particularly celebrated because it contained both unmatched power and accuracy, two factors many juniors may find challenging to acquire earlier in their development and thus have driven a good number of them, especially girls, to choose playing two-handed backhands. Additionally, Henin&#x27;s one-handed backhand also enabled her to play with not only more reach but also more variety in her shots (e.g. slices instead of topspin etc.) as the situation required. John McEnroe has called Henin&#x27;s backhand &quot;the best in men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s tennis.&quot;

=== Volleying ability ===

Henin, who had always been considered one of the better volleyers on tour —a player with an all court game— soon established herself as one of the best in the modern era.
Two-time US Open Champion Tracy Austin commented, &quot;At the net she&#x27;s quite comfortable displaying excellent technique. She knows where to position herself—a contrast to many other players who get up to the net and look like a deer in headlights.&quot;
Renowned tennis coach Nick Bollettieri included Henin as one of the few female tennis players he regarded as being a successful volleyer and an adept serve-and-volleyer, alongside the likes of Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotná.

== Personal life ==

On 16 November 2002, Henin married Pierre-Yves Hardenne in the &quot;Château de Lavaux-Sainte-Anne&quot;, and officially adopted the name Henin-Hardenne. On 4 January 2007, she withdrew from forthcoming tournaments including the Australian Open due to personal issues. She confirmed three weeks later that she had officially separated from her husband. The same year, she reverted to using the name Henin. In the meantime, following a conflict between Henin and her father, over her tennis career and her relationship with Pierre-Yves Hardenne, Carlos Rodríguez became not only her trainer and coach, but in ways a second father figure for the duration of her active tennis career.

Since March 2011, Henin has been in a relationship with Benoît Bertuzzo, a Belgian film director and actor, and secretly married him in March 2015. On 12 September 2012, Henin announced that she was pregnant, giving birth to a girl in 2013. In 2017, she gave birth to a second child, a son.

=== Public life and endorsements ===

Henin has worn apparel manufactured by Adidas and used Wilson racquets for her tournaments. Uncharacteristically for a tennis pro, Henin always used to wear her sponsorship provided Rolex wristwatch even during matches. Later on this habit would be replicated by others on the tour, including Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams.

In May 2007, Henin and her coach Carlos Rodríguez started the Academy 6th Sense. At the 2009 US Open – Girls&#x27; doubles the Ukrainian tennis player Maryna Zanevska became the first &quot;6th Sense player&quot; to win a Junior Grand Slam title.

On 30 November 2007, Henin opened her own tennis academy Club Justine N1 (in French, &quot;N1&quot; is pronounced almost identically to &quot;Henin&quot;).

After retiring, Henin became involved in two Belgian reality shows in 2009. In May, she starred in &quot;De Twaalf Werken van Justine Henin&quot; – &quot;Les 12 travaux de Justine Henin&quot; (&quot;The 12 Labours of Justine Henin&quot;). The show followed Henin as she completed 12 personal challenges. In June 2009, she hosted a musical TV show that revolved around Belgian-Italian singer Lara Fabian.

<text>Shulamit Ran (; born October 21, 1949, in Tel Aviv, Israel) is an Israeli-American composer. She moved from Israel to New York City at 14, as a scholarship student at the Mannes College of Music. Her Symphony (1990) won her the Pulitzer Prize for Music.

Born in Israel in 1949, Ran began composing songs to Hebrew poetry at the age of seven. By the age of nine, she was studying composition with some of Israel&#x27;s top composers, most notably Alexander Boskovich and Paul Ben-Haim. As a child, Jewish cantoral music played on the radio by her father had a huge impact on Ran. This is apparent in her opera &quot;Between Two Worlds – The Dybbuk&quot;.

In addition to piano, she studied composition with Norman Dello Joio and Ralph Shapey. While in the United States, studied piano with Nadia Reisenberg and Dorothy Taubman. During her time in the US, Shapey and composer Elliott Carter helped shape Ran&#x27;s compositional voice, which was constantly changing.

===Academic career===
After studying with Shapey, he invited Ran to follow in his path of music education. In 1973, at the age of 26, Ran joined the faculty at University of Chicago, where she eventually was named the Andrew MacLeish Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Music, she also became the artistic director of Contempo (formerly the Contemporary Chamber Players). Ran, whose students included Melinda Wagner, Suzanne Sorkin, Matt Malsky, Jonathan Elliott and Jorge Liderman, retired from her position at the University of Chicago in June 2015. She also became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>Christiaan Eijkman ( , , ; 11 August 1858 – 5 November 1930) was a Dutch physician and professor of physiology whose demonstration that beriberi is caused by poor diet led to the discovery of antineuritic vitamins (thiamine). Together with Sir Frederick Hopkins, he received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for the discovery of vitamins.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Christiaan Eijkman was born on 11 August 1858, at Nijkerk, Netherlands as the seventh child of Christiaan Eijkman, the headmaster of a local school, and Johanna Alida Pool. His elder brother Johann Frederik Eijkman (1851–1915) was also a chemist.

A year later, in 1859, the Eijkman family moved to Zaandam, where his father was appointed head of a newly founded school for advanced elementary education. It was here that Christiaan and his brothers received their early education. In 1875, after taking his preliminary examinations, Eijkman became a student at the Military Medical School of the University of Amsterdam, where he was trained as a medical officer for the Netherlands Indies Army, passing through all his examinations with honours.

From 1879 to 1881, he was an assistant of T. Place, Professor of Physiology, during which time he wrote his thesis &quot;On Polarization of the Nerves&quot;, which gained him his doctoral degree, with honours, on 13 July 1883.

===Career===

In 1883, Eijkman left the Netherlands for The Dutch East Indies, where he was made medical officer of health, first in Semarang, then later at Tjilatjap, a small village on the south coast of Java, and at Padang Sidempoean in Northern Sumatra. It was at Tjilatjap that he caught malaria, which later so impaired his health that in 1885 he had to return to Europe on sick-leave.

For Eijkman this was to prove a lucky event, as it enabled him to work in E. Forster&#x27;s laboratory in Amsterdam, and also in Robert Koch&#x27;s bacteriological laboratory in Berlin; here he came into contact with C. A. Pekelharing and C. Winkler, who were visiting the German capital before their departure to the Indies. In this way medical officer Christiaan Eijkman was seconded as assistant to the Pekelharing-Winkler mission, together with his colleague M. B. Romeny. This mission had been sent out by the Dutch Government to conduct investigations into Beriberi, a disease which at that time was causing havoc in that region.

In 1887, Pekelharing and Winkler were recalled, but before their departure Pekelharing proposed to the Governor General that the laboratory which had been temporarily set up for the Commission in the Military Hospital in Batavia should be made permanent. This proposal was readily accepted, and Christiaan Eijkman was appointed its first director. Now he was able to devote himself entirely to science.

Eijkman was Director of the &quot;Geneeskundig Laboratorium&quot; (Medical Laboratory) from 15 January 1888 to 4 March 1896, and during that time he made a number of his most important researches. These dealt first of all with the physiology of people living in tropical regions. He was able to demonstrate that a number of theories had no factual basis. Firstly he proved that in the blood of Europeans living in the tropics the number of red corpuscles, the specific gravity, the serum, and the water content, undergo no change, at least when the blood is not affected by disease which will ultimately lead to anaemia. Comparing the metabolism of the European with that of the native, he found that in the tropics as well in the temperate zone, this is entirely governed by the work carried out. Neither could he find any disparity in respiratory metabolism, perspiration, and temperature regulation. Thus Eijkman put an end to a number of speculations on the acclimatization of Europeans in the tropics which had hitherto necessitated the taking of various precautions.

====Greatest work====
Eijkman had been sent to the Dutch East Indies to study beriberi, a disease of the peripheral nerves, but his discovery of the cause was accidental. He noticed the symptoms of beriberi in some chickens used in his laboratory when their feed had been altered for a few months. During that time, chickens in the laboratory had been fed leftover rice from military rations, until a new cook refused to allow military rice to be fed to civilian animals. Rice was then purchased from another source, and the birds soon recovered. During the months that the chickens developed beriberi, the feed had been polished rice, and when the birds&#x27; diet was switched back to unpolished rice, the birds recovered in a few days. Eijkman surmised that polished rice lacked a dietary component found in unpolished rice, and that beriberi was caused by depriving the body of this component, which he called &quot;the anti-beriberi factor&quot;. Subsequently, Eijkman was able to prove that the disease was not caused by blood contamination, respiratory metabolism, perspiration, or seasonal or temperature variation. He suspected the disease was caused by an unknown bacterium.

Eijkman was unable to continue his research due to ill health, but a study by his friend Adolphe Vorderman confirmed the link between polished rice and the disease. Eventually it was determined the missing compound that was causing beriberi was vitamin B1, thiamine. Chemist Casimir Funk shortened the term &quot;vital amine&quot; to coin a new word, vitamin. For his contributions to the discovery of antineuritic vitamins, Eijkman won the 1929 Nobel Prize for Medicine, sharing the prize with Sir Frederick Hopkins. Funk, perhaps unfairly, was never given full credit for his work.

In addition to his work on beriberi, he occupied himself with other problems such as arach fermentation, and indeed still had time to write two textbooks for his students at the Java Medical School, one on physiology and the other on organic chemistry.

====Later life and death====
In 1898 he became successor to G. van Overbeek de Meyer, as Professor in Hygiene and Forensic Medicine at Utrecht. His inaugural speech was entitled &quot;Over Gezondheid en Ziekten in Tropische Gewesten&quot; (On health and diseases in tropical regions). At Utrecht, Eijkman turned to the study of bacteriology, and carried out his well-known fermentation test, by means of which it can be readily established if water has been polluted by human and animal defecation containing coli bacilli. Another research was into the rate of mortality of bacteria as a result of various external factors, whereby he was able to show that this process could not be represented by a logarithmic curve. This was followed by his investigation of the phenomenon that the rate of growth of bacteria on solid substratum often decreases, finally coming to a halt. Beyerinck&#x27;s auxanographic method was applied on several occasions by Eijkman, as for example during the secretion of enzymes which break down casein or bring about haemolysis, whereby he could demonstrate the hydrolysis of fats under the influence of lipases.

Eijkman did not confine himself to the University. He also engaged himself in problems of water supply, housing, school hygiene, physical education. As a member of the Gezondheidsraad (Health Council) and the Gezondheidscommissie (Health Commission), he participated in the struggle against alcoholism and tuberculosis. He was the founder of the Vereeniging tot Bestrijding van de Tuberculose (Society for the struggle against tuberculosis ).

He died in Utrecht, on 5 November 1930, after a protracted illness.

====Awards and legacy====
In 1907, Eijkman was appointed Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, after having been Correspondent since 1895. The Dutch Government conferred upon him several orders of knighthood, whereas on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his professorship a fund was established to enable the awarding of the Eijkman Medal. But the crown of all his work was the award of the Nobel Prize in 1929.

Eijkman was holder of the John Scott Medal, Philadelphia, and foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. He was also honorary fellow of the Royal Sanitary Institute in London.

To honor his dedication, the government of Indonesia named his research center on pathology and bacteriology the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology.

===Personal life===
In 1883, before his departure to the Indies, Eijkman married Aaltje Wigeri van Edema, who died in 1886. In Batavia, Professor Eijkman married Bertha Julie Louise van der Kemp in 1888; a son, Pieter Hendrik, who became a physician, was born in 1890.

<doc id="240832" wikidata="Q916280" url="?curid=240832" title="Restless legs syndrome">
<text>Restless legs syndrome (RLS), (also known as Willis–Ekbom disease (WED), is a neurological disorder, usually chronic, that causes an overwhelming urge to move one&#x27;s legs. There is often an unpleasant feeling in the legs that improves temporarily by moving them. This feeling is often described as aching, tingling, or crawling in nature. Occasionally, arms may also be affected. The feelings generally happen when at rest and therefore can make it hard to sleep. Sleep disruption may leave people with RLS sleepy during the day, with low energy, and irritable or depressed. Additionally, many have limb twitching during sleep, a condition known as &quot;periodic limb movement disorder&quot;. RLS is not the same as habitual foot-tapping or leg-rocking.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Diagnosis of RLS is generally based on a person&#x27;s symptoms after ruling out other potential causes. Risk factors include low iron levels, kidney failure, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy and celiac disease. A number of medications may also trigger the disorder including antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, and calcium channel blockers.

RLS may either be of early onset, occurring before age 45, or late-onset, occurring after age 45. Early-onset cases tend to progress more slowly and involve fewer comorbidities, while cases in older patients may progress suddenly and alongside other conditions.

RLS may resolve if the underlying problem is addressed. Otherwise treatment includes lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes that may help include stopping alcohol and tobacco use, and sleep hygiene. Medications used to treat RLS include dopamine agonists like pramipexole and gabapentinoids (α2δ ligands) like gabapentin. RLS affects an estimated 2.5–15% of the American population. Females are more commonly affected than males, and RLS becomes increasingly common with age.

==History==
Sir Thomas Willis provided a medical description in 1672. Willis emphasized the sleep disruption and limb movements experienced by people with RLS.

Subsequently, other descriptions of RLS were published, including by (1861) (in relation to whom it is sometimes known as Wittmaack-Ekbom syndrome).

In 1945, Karl-Axel Ekbom (1907–1977) provided a detailed and comprehensive report of this condition in his doctoral thesis, &quot;restless legs: clinical study of hitherto overlooked disease&quot;. Ekbom coined the term &quot;restless legs&quot;.

Ekbom&#x27;s work was largely ignored until it was rediscovered by Arthur S. Walters and Wayne A. Hening in the 1980s. Subsequent landmark publications include 1995 and 2003 papers, which revised and updated the diagnostic criteria.

==Signs and symptoms==
RLS sensations range from pain or aching in the muscles, to &quot;an itch you can&#x27;t scratch&quot;, a &quot;buzzing sensation&quot;, an unpleasant &quot;tickle that won&#x27;t stop&quot;, a &quot;crawling&quot; feeling, or limbs jerking while awake. The sensations typically begin or intensify during quiet wakefulness, such as when relaxing, reading, studying, or trying to sleep.

The sensations—and the need to move—may return immediately after ceasing movement or at a later time. RLS may start at any age, including childhood, and is a progressive disease for some, while the symptoms may remit in others. In a survey among members of the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation, it was found that up to 45% of patients had their first symptoms before the age of 20 years.
* &quot;An urge to move, usually due to uncomfortable sensations that occur primarily in the legs, but occasionally in the arms or elsewhere.&quot; The sensations are unusual and unlike other common sensations. Those with RLS have difficulty describing them, using words or phrases such as uncomfortable, painful, &#x27;antsy&#x27;, electrical, creeping, itching, pins and needles, pulling, crawling, buzzing, and numbness. It is sometimes described as similar to a limb &#x27;falling asleep&#x27; or an exaggerated sense of positional awareness of the affected area. The sensation and the urge can occur in any body part; the most cited location is the legs, followed by the arms. Some people have little or no sensation but still have a strong urge to move.
* &quot;Motor restlessness, expressed as activity, which relieves the urge to move.&quot; Movement usually brings immediate relief, although temporary and partial. Walking is most common; however, stretching, yoga, biking, or other physical activity may relieve the symptoms. Continuous, fast up-and-down movements of the leg, and/or rapidly moving the legs toward then away from each other, may keep sensations at bay without walking. Specific movements may be unique to each person.
* &quot;Worsening of symptoms by relaxation.&quot; Sitting or lying down (reading, plane ride, watching TV) can trigger the sensations and urge to move. Severity depends on the severity of the person&#x27;s RLS, the degree of restfulness, the duration of the inactivity, etc.
* &quot;Variability throughout the day-night cycle, with symptoms worse in the evening and early in the night.&quot; Some experience RLS only at bedtime, while others experience it throughout the day and night. Most people experience the worst symptoms in the evening and the least in the morning.
* &quot;Restless legs feel similar to the urge to yawn, situated in the legs or arms.&quot; These symptoms of RLS can make sleeping difficult for many patients and a 2005 National Sleep Foundation poll shows the presence of significant daytime difficulties resulting from this condition. These problems range from being late for work to missing work or events because of drowsiness. Patients with RLS who responded reported driving while drowsy more than patients without RLS. These daytime difficulties can translate into safety, social and economic issues for the patient and for society.

RLS may contribute to higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders in RLS patients.

===Primary and secondary forms===
RLS is categorized as either primary or secondary.
* Primary RLS is considered idiopathic or with no known cause. Primary RLS usually begins slowly, before approximately 40–45 years of age, and may disappear for months or even years. It is often progressive and gets worse with age. RLS in children is often misdiagnosed as growing pains.
* Secondary RLS often has a sudden onset after age 40 and may be daily from the beginning. It is most associated with specific medical conditions or certain drugs (see below).

==Causes==
While the cause is generally unknown, it is believed to be caused by changes in the neurotransmitter dopamine resulting in an abnormal use of iron by the brain. RLS is often due to iron deficiency (low total body iron status) and could be a sign of anemia caused by internal bleeding or bone marrow issues. Other associated conditions may include end-stage kidney disease and hemodialysis, folate deficiency, magnesium deficiency, sleep apnea, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and certain autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. RLS can worsen in pregnancy, possibly due to elevated estrogen levels. Use of alcohol, nicotine products, and caffeine may be associated with RLS. A 2014 study from the American Academy of Neurology also found that reduced leg oxygen levels were strongly associated with restless legs syndrome symptom severity in untreated patients.

===ADHD===
An association has been observed between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and RLS or periodic limb movement disorder. Both conditions appear to have links to dysfunctions related to the neurotransmitter dopamine, and common medications for both conditions among other systems, affect dopamine levels in the brain. A 2005 study suggested that up to 44% of people with ADHD had comorbid (i.e. coexisting) RLS, and up to 26% of people with RLS had confirmed ADHD or symptoms of the condition.

===Medications===
Certain medications may cause or worsen RLS, or cause it secondarily, including the following:
* certain antiemetics (antidopaminergic ones)
* certain antihistamines (especially the sedating, first generation H1 antihistamines often in over-the-counter cold medications)
* many antidepressants (both older TCAs and newer SSRIs)
* Antipsychotics.
* a rebound effect of sedative-hypnotic drugs such as a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome from discontinuing benzodiazepine tranquilizers or sleeping pills
* alcohol withdrawal can also cause restless legs syndrome and other movement disorders such as akathisia and parkinsonism usually associated with antipsychotics
* opioid withdrawal is associated with causing and worsening RLS

Both primary and secondary RLS can be worsened by surgery of any kind; however, back surgery or injury can be associated with causing RLS.

The cause vs. effect of certain conditions and behaviors observed in some patients (ex. excess weight, lack of exercise, depression, or other mental illnesses) is not well established. Loss of sleep due to RLS could cause the conditions, or medication used to treat a condition could cause RLS.

===Genetics===

More than 60% of cases of RLS are familial and are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance.

Research and brain autopsies have implicated both the dopaminergic system and iron insufficiency in the substantia nigra. Iron is well understood to be an essential cofactor for the formation of L-dopa, the precursor of dopamine.

Six genetic loci found by linkage are known and listed below. Other than the first one, all of the linkage loci were discovered using an autosomal dominant inheritance model.
* The first genetic locus was discovered in one large French Canadian family and maps to chromosome 12q. This locus was discovered using an autosomal recessive inheritance model. Evidence for this locus was also found using a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in 12 Bavarian families.
* The second RLS locus maps to chromosome 14q and was discovered in one Italian family. Evidence for this locus was found in one French Canadian family. Also, an association study in a large sample 159 trios of European descent showed some evidence for this locus.
* This locus maps to chromosome 9p and was discovered in two unrelated American families. Evidence for this locus was also found by the TDT in a large Bavarian family, in which significant linkage to this locus was found.
* This locus maps to chromosome 20p and was discovered in a large French Canadian family with RLS.
* This locus maps to chromosome 2p and was found in three related families from population isolated in South Tyrol.
* The sixth locus is located on chromosome 16p12.1 and was discovered by Levchenko et al. in 2008.

Three genes, MEIS1, BTBD9 and MAP2K5, were found to be associated to RLS.
Their role in RLS pathogenesis is still unclear. More recently, a fourth gene, PTPRD was found to be associated with RLS.

There is also some evidence that periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are associated with on chromosome 6p21.2, MEIS1, MAP2K5/SKOR1, and PTPRD. The presence of a positive family history suggests that there may be a genetic involvement in the etiology of RLS.

==Mechanism==
Although it is only partly understood, pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome may involve dopamine and iron system anomalies. There is also a commonly acknowledged circadian rhythm explanatory mechanism associated with it, clinically shown simply by biomarkers of circadian rhythm, such as body temperature. The interactions between impaired neuronal iron uptake and the functions of the neuromelanin-containing and dopamine-producing cells have roles in RLS development, indicating that iron deficiency might affect the brain dopaminergic transmissions in different ways.

Medial thalamic nuclei may also have a role in RLS as part as the limbic system modulated by the dopaminergic system which may affect pain perception. Improvement of RLS symptoms occurs in people receiving low-dose dopamine agonists.

==Diagnosis==
There are no specific tests for RLS, but non-specific laboratory tests are used to rule out other causes such as vitamin deficiencies. Five symptoms are used to confirm the diagnosis:
* A strong urge to move the limbs, usually associated with unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations.
* It starts or worsens during inactivity or rest.
* It improves or disappears (at least temporarily) with activity.
* It worsens in the evening or night.
* These symptoms are not caused by any medical or behavioral condition.

The symptoms below are not essential, like the ones above, but occur commonly in RLS patients:
* genetic component or family history with RLS
* good response to dopaminergic therapy
* periodic leg movements during the day or sleep
* most strongly affected are people who are middle-aged or older
* other sleep disturbances are experienced
* decreased iron stores can be a risk factor and should be assessed

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), the main symptoms have to be associated with a sleep disturbance or impairment to support RLS diagnosis. As stated by this classification, RLS symptoms should begin or worsen when being inactive, be relieved when moving, should happen exclusively or mostly in the evening and at night, not be triggered by other medical or behavioral conditions, and should impair one&#x27;s quality of life. Generally, both legs are affected, but in some cases there is an asymmetry.

===Differential diagnosis===
The most common conditions that should be differentiated with RLS include leg cramps, positional discomfort, local leg injury, arthritis, leg edema, venous stasis, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, habitual foot tapping/leg rocking, anxiety, myalgia, and drug-induced akathisia.

Peripheral artery disease and arthritis can also cause leg pain but this usually gets worse with movement.

There are less common differential diagnostic conditions included myelopathy, myopathy, vascular or neurogenic claudication, hypotensive akathisia, orthostatic tremor, painful legs, and moving toes.

==Treatment==
If RLS is not linked to an underlying cause, its frequency may be reduced by lifestyle modifications such as adopting improving sleep hygiene, regular exercise, and stopping smoking. Medications used may include dopamine agonists and gabapentinoids in those with daily restless legs syndrome. In severe or refractory cases, opioids have been used.

Treatment of RLS should not be considered until possible medical causes are ruled out. Secondary RLS may be cured if precipitating medical conditions (anemia) are managed effectively.

===Physical measures===
Stretching the leg muscles can bring temporary relief. Walking and moving the legs, as the name &quot;restless legs&quot; implies, brings temporary relief. In fact, those with RLS often have an almost uncontrollable need to walk and therefore relieve the symptoms while they are moving. Unfortunately, the symptoms usually return immediately after the moving and walking ceases.

Counter-stimulation from massage, a hot or cold compress, or a vibratory counter-stimulation device has been found to help some people with primary RLS to improve their sleep.

===Iron===
There is some evidence that intravenous iron supplementation moderately improves restlessness for people with RLS.

===Medications===
For those whose RLS disrupts or prevents sleep or regular daily activities, medication may be useful. Evidence supports the use of dopamine agonists including pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, cabergoline, and pergolide. They reduce symptoms, improve sleep quality and quality of life. Levodopa is also effective. However, pergolide and cabergoline are less recommended due to their association with increased risk of valvular heart disease. Ropinirole has a faster onset with shorter duration. Rotigotine is commonly used as a transdermal patch which continuously provides stable plasma drug concentrations, resulting in its particular therapeutic effect on patients with symptoms throughout the day. A 2008 meta-analysis found pramipexole to be better than ropinirole.

There are, however, issues with the use of dopamine agonists including augmentation. This is a medical condition where the drug itself causes symptoms to increase in severity and/or occur earlier in the day. Dopamine agonists may also cause rebound when symptoms increase as the drug wears off. In many cases, the longer dopamine agonists have been used, the higher the risk of augmentation and rebound as well as the severity of the symptoms. Patients may also develop dopamine dysregulation syndrome, meaning that they can experience an addictive pattern of dopamine replacement therapy. A 2007 study indicated that dopamine agonists used in restless legs syndrome can lead to an increase in compulsive gambling. Patients may also exhibit other impulse-control disorders such as compulsive shopping and compulsive eating. There are some indications that stopping the dopamine agonist treatment has an impact on the resolution or at least improvement of the impulse-control disorder, even though some people can be particularly exposed to dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome.

Gabapentinoids (α2δ ligands), including gabapentin, pregabalin, and gabapentin enacarbil, are also widely used in the treatment of RLS. They are used as first-line treatments similarly to dopamine agonists, and as of 2019, guidelines have started to recommend gabapentinoids over dopamine agonists as initial therapy for RLS due to higher known risks of symptom augmentation with long-term dopamine agonist therapy. Gabapentin enacarbil is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of RLS, whereas gabapentin and pregabalin are used off-label. Data on gabapentinoids in the treatment of RLS are more limited compared to dopamine agonists. However, based on available evidence, gabapentinoids are similarly effective to dopamine agonists in the treatment of RLS.

Both the 2021 algorithm for the treatment of RLS published by members of the Scientific and Medical Advisory Board of the RLS Foundation in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, and the 2024 American Academy of Sleep Medicine Practice Guidelines recommend the use of low-dose opioids for the treatment of refractory RLS, with the caveat that, although opioids are highly effective, “reasonable precautions should be taken in light of the opioid epidemic.&quot; Among the opioids and their suggested doses are tramadol, codeine, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone (all of which are schedule II), and buprenorphine (a schedule III partial opioid-receptor agonist with a lower risk of causing respiratory depression or dependence, compared with the full-agonist opioids. The only data publicly available on the use of buprenorphine in the treatment of RLS are two posters presented at the 2019 and 2023 Associated Professional Sleep Society’s meetings. In the first, Forbes et al presented preliminary open-label data from five men and two women, with an average age of 68 years, who had experienced RLS symptoms for a mean of 30+ years and been treated for 10+ years using a mean of nine drugs. The severity of both RLS and insomnia decreased significantly according to the IRLSSG Rating Scale scores and Insomnia Severity Index (31.1 ± 6.7 at baseline to 4 ± 8 and 19.8 ± 6.1 to 1.3 ± 1.9, respectively). In the second study, Berkowsi and colleagues presented data from a retrospective study of 55 patients who had been started on buprenorphine for the treatment of severe RLS. Mean IRLSSG severity scores decreased from 27.8 at baseline to 11.4 at 1 year and allowed most of those patients on dopamine receptor agonists who had developed augmentation to discontinue the dopamine receptor agonists.

Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam or clonazepam, are not generally recommended, and their effectiveness is unknown or contradictory. They, however, are sometimes still used as a second-line treatment, as add-on agents. Other treatments have also been explored, such as valproate, carbamazepine, perampanel, and dipyridamole, but are either not effective or have insufficient data to support their use.

===Placebo===
Placebos provide a large benefit in reducing RLS symptoms. This is thought to be due to positive expectancy effects and conditioning, which activate dopamine and opioid pathways in the brain. Both dopamine agonists and opioids are used in and effective for the treatment of RLS, which is thought to be related to the effectiveness of placebos for the condition. More than half of the benefit of RLS medications such as pramipexole and gabapentin enacarbil appears to be due to the placebo component based on clinical trial data.

==Prognosis==
RLS symptoms may gradually worsen with age, although more slowly for those with the idiopathic form of RLS than those with an associated medical condition. Current therapies can control the disorder, minimizing symptoms and increasing periods of restful sleep. In addition, some people have remissions, periods in which symptoms decrease or disappear for days, weeks, or months, although symptoms usually eventually reappear. Being diagnosed with RLS does not indicate or foreshadow another neurological disease, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease. RLS symptoms can worsen over time when dopamine-related drugs are used for therapy, an effect called augmentation which may represent symptoms occurring throughout the day and affect movements of all limbs. There is no cure for RLS.

==Epidemiology==
RLS affects an estimated 2.5–15% of the American population. A minority (around 2.7% of the population) experience daily or severe symptoms. RLS is twice as common in women as in men, and Caucasians are more prone to RLS than people of African descent. RLS occurs in 3% of individuals from the Mediterranean or Middle Eastern regions, and in 1–5% of those from East Asia, indicating that different genetic or environmental factors, including diet, may play a role in the prevalence of this syndrome. RLS diagnosed at an older age runs a more severe course. RLS is even more common in individuals with iron deficiency, pregnancy, or end-stage kidney disease. The National Sleep Foundation&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Sleep in America&quot; poll showed that up to 25 percent of pregnant women developed RLS during the third trimester. Poor general health is also linked.

There are several risk factors for RLS, including old age, family history, and uremia. The prevalence of RLS tends to increase with age, as well as its severity and longer duration of symptoms. People with uremia receiving renal dialysis have a prevalence from 20% to 57%, while those having kidney transplant improve compared to those treated with dialysis.

RLS can occur at all ages but usually begins in the third or fourth decade. Genome‐wide association studies have now identified 19 risk loci associated with RLS. Neurological conditions linked to RLS include Parkinson&#x27;s disease, spinal cerebellar atrophy, spinal stenosis, lumbosacral radiculopathy and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2.

===Nomenclature===
In 2013, the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation renamed itself the Willis–Ekbom Disease Foundation; however, it reverted to its original name in 2015 “to better support its mission”.

A point of confusion is that RLS and delusional parasitosis are entirely different conditions that have both been called &quot;Ekbom syndrome&quot;, as both syndromes were described by the same person, Karl-Axel Ekbom. Today, calling WED/RLS &quot;Ekbom syndrome&quot; is outdated usage, as the unambiguous names (WED or RLS) are preferred for clarity.

==Controversy==
Some doctors express the view that the incidence of restless legs syndrome is exaggerated by manufacturers of drugs used to treat it. Others believe it is an underrecognized and undertreated disorder. Further, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) ran advertisements that, while not promoting off-license use of their drug (ropinirole) for treatment of RLS, did link to the Ekbom Support Group website. That website contained statements advocating the use of ropinirole to treat RLS. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) ruled against GSK in this case.

==Research==
Different measurements have been used to evaluate treatments in RLS. Most of them are based on subjective rating scores, such as IRLS rating scale (IRLS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Patient Global Impression (PGI), and Quality of Life (QoL). These questionnaires provide information about the severity and progress of the disease, as well as the person&#x27;s quality of life and sleep. Polysomnography (PSG) and actigraphy (both related to sleep parameters) are more objective resources that provide evidence of sleep disturbances associated with RLS symptoms.

<doc id="240834" wikidata="Q1438024" url="?curid=240834" title="Kylin (operating system)">
<text>Kylin () is an operating system developed by academics at the National University of Defense Technology in the People&#x27;s Republic of China since 2001. It is named after the mythical beast &quot;qilin&quot;. The first versions were based on FreeBSD and were intended for use by the Chinese military and other government organizations. With version 3.0, Kylin became Linux-based, and there is a version called NeoKylin which was announced in 2010.

By 2019, the NeoKylin variant is compatible with more than 4,000 software and hardware products, and it ships pre-installed on most computers sold in China. Together, Kylin and Neokylin have 90% market share of the government sector.

A separate project using Ubuntu as the base Linux operating system was announced in 2013. The first version of Ubuntu Kylin was released in April 2013.

In August 2020, v10 of Kylin OS was launched. It is compatible with 10,000 hardware and software products, and it &quot;supports Google&#x27;s Android ecosystem&quot;.

In July 2022, an open-source version of Kylin, titled openKylin was released.

==FreeBSD version==
Development of Kylin began in 2001, when the National University of Defense Technology was assigned the mission of developing an operating system under the 863 Program intended to make China independent of foreign technology. The aim was &quot;to support several kinds of server platforms, to achieve high performance, high availability and high security, as well as conforming to international standards of Unix and Linux operating systems&quot;. It was created using a hierarchy model, including &quot;the basic kernel layer which is similar to Mach, the system service layer which is similar to BSD and the desktop environment which is similar to Windows&quot;. It was designed to comply with the UNIX standards and to be compatible with Linux applications.

In February 2006, &quot;China Military Online&quot; (a website sponsored by PLA Daily of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army) reported the &quot;successful development of the Kylin server operating system&quot;, which it said was &quot;the first 64-bit operating system with high security level (B2 class)&quot; and &quot;also the first operating system without Linux kernel that has obtained Linux global standard authentification by the international Free Standards Group&quot;.

In April 2006, it was said that the Kylin operating system was largely based on FreeBSD 5.3. An anonymous Chinese student in Australia, who used the pseudonym &quot;Dancefire&quot;, carried out a kernel similarity analysis and showed that the similarities between the two operating systems reached 99.45 percent. One of Kylin&#x27;s developers confirmed that Kylin was based on FreeBSD during a speech at the international conference EuroBSDCon 2006.

In 2009, a report presented to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that the purpose of Kylin is to make Chinese computers impenetrable to competing countries in the cyberwarfare arena. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that:

China has developed more secure operating software for its tens of millions of computers and is already installing it on government and military systems, hoping to make Beijing’s networks impenetrable to U.S. military and intelligence agencies.

The deployment of Kylin was said to have &quot;hardened key Chinese servers&quot;.

==Kylin Linux (NeoKylin)==
With the advent of version 3.0, Kylin has used the Linux kernel.

In December 2010, it was announced that China Standard Software and the National University of Defense Technology had signed a strategic partnership to launch a version called NeoKylin. China Standard Software is the maker of the &quot;NeoShine Linux&quot; desktop series. NeoKylin is intended for use by government offices, national defense, energy and other sectors of the Chinese economy.

In 2014, Bloomberg News reported that the northeastern city of Siping had migrated its computers from Microsoft Windows to NeoKylin, as part of a government effort to shift computer technology to Chinese suppliers. In September 2015, US computer maker Dell reported that 42% of personal computers they sold in China were now running NeoKylin.

The operating system of the Tianhe-1 supercomputer is 64-bit Kylin Linux, which is oriented to high-performance parallel computing optimization, and supports power management and high-performance virtual computing. The newer Tianhe-2 also uses Kylin Linux.

==Ubuntu Kylin==

In 2013, Canonical reached an agreement with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to release an Ubuntu-based Linux OS with features targeted at the Chinese market. Ubuntu Kylin has been described as &quot;a loose continuation of China&#x27;s Kylin OS&quot;. It is intended for desktop and laptop computers. The first official release, Ubuntu Kylin 13.04, was on 25 April 2013.

<doc id="240836" wikidata="Q76464" url="?curid=240836" title="Otto Heinrich Warburg">
<text>Otto Heinrich Warburg (, ; 8 October 1883 – 1 August 1970) was a German physiologist, medical doctor, and Nobel laureate. He served as an officer in the elite Uhlan (cavalry regiment) during the First World War, and was awarded the Iron Cross (1st Class) for bravery. He was the sole recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1931. In total, he was nominated for the award 47 times over the course of his career.

==Biography==
Otto Heinrich Warburg was born in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1883, close to the Swiss border. Otto&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a Protestant family of bankers and civil servants from Baden. His father, Emil Warburg, had converted to Protestantism as an adult, although Emil&#x27;s parents were Orthodox Jews. Emil was a member of the illustrious Warburg family of Altona. Emil was also president of the &quot;Physikalische Reichsanstalt, Wirklicher Geheimer Oberregierungsrat&quot; (True Senior Privy Counselor).

Otto Warburg studied chemistry under Emil Fischer, and earned his doctorate in chemistry in Berlin in 1906. He then studied under Ludolf von Krehl and earned the degree of doctor of medicine in Heidelberg in 1911.

Between 1908 and 1914, Warburg was affiliated with the Naples Marine Biological Station, (in Naples, Italy), where he conducted research. In later years, he would return for visits, and maintained a lifelong friendship with the family of the station&#x27;s director, Anton Dohrn.

A lifelong equestrian, he served as an officer in the elite Uhlans (cavalry) on the front during the First World War, where he won the Iron Cross. Warburg later credited this experience with affording him invaluable insights into &quot;real life&quot; outside the confines of academia. Toward the end of the war, when the outcome was unmistakable, Albert Einstein, who had been a friend of Warburg&#x27;s father Emil, wrote to Warburg at the behest of friends, asking him to leave the army and return to academia, since it would be a tragedy for the world to lose his talents. Einstein and Warburg later became friends, and Einstein&#x27;s work in physics had a great influence on Warburg&#x27;s biochemical research.

==Scientific work and Nobel Prize==

While working at the Marine Biological Station, Warburg performed research on oxygen consumption in sea urchin eggs after fertilization and showed that upon fertilization the rate of respiration increases as much as sixfold. His experiments also showed that iron is essential for the development of the larval stage.

In 1918, Warburg was appointed professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem (part of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft). By 1931 he was named director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Cell Physiology, which had been founded the previous year by a donation of the Rockefeller Foundation to the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (since renamed the Max Planck Society).

Warburg investigated the metabolism of tumors and the respiration of cells, particularly cancer cells, and in 1931 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology for his &quot;discovery of the nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme&quot;. In particular, he discovered that animal tumors produce large quantities of lactic acid. The award came after receiving 46 nominations over a period of nine years beginning in 1923, 13 of which were submitted in 1931, the year he won the prize.

The Nobel laureate George Wald, having completed his Ph.D. in zoology at Columbia University, received an award from the U.S. National Research Council to study with Warburg. During his time with Warburg, 1932–1933, Wald discovered vitamin A in the retina.

==Survival under the Nazis==
When the Nazis came to power, people of Jewish descent were forced from their professional positions, although the Nazis made exceptions. Warburg had a Protestant mother and a father with Jewish heritage (who had converted to Protestantism). According to the Reichsbürgergesetz from 1935 (cf. Nuremberg Laws) Warburg, as a &quot;half-Jew&quot; was labeled a Halbjude or Mischling.

Warburg was also at risk due to his relationship with Jacob Heiss, with whom he lived and worked. Beginning around 1918, Heiss served variously as Warburg&#x27;s personal aid, secretary, and administrative assistant.
The couple lived together in an elegant villa in Dahlem, in Berlin.

Warburg was banned from teaching, but allowed to carry on his research.
In 1941, Warburg briefly lost his post for making remarks critical of the Nazi regime, but in a few weeks was able to resume his research following a personal order from Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery. Hermann Göring also arranged for him to be classified as one-quarter Jewish.
In September 1942, Warburg made an official request for equal status (&quot;Gleichstellung&quot;) with German Aryans, which was granted.

The Nazis were willing to allow Warburg to work because of his focus on metabolism and cancer. Hitler was obsessed with cancer, having lost his own mother to breast cancer at an early age. The decisive factor was Warburg&#x27;s distinguished military service in the Great War, as Jewish veterans were often exempted from the loss of citizenship mandated by the Nuremberg laws. Warburg&#x27;s Germanic physiognomy may also have weighed in his favor, as Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery is known to have factored in eye color and face shape when evaluating Aryanization applications.

Warburg disagreed with the Nazi regime, and refused to acknowledge the Nazi salute, to the point of provoking retaliation from its officers. Authors have speculated on why he stayed in Germany under the Reich. Apple suggests that, like many others, he did not imagine how bad things could get. His own egotism may have led him to underestimate the potential threat posed by the Nazis. 
Others have suggested that Warburg was so totally devoted to his work that he was prepared not only to stay in Germany but to tolerate the treatment of his Jewish colleagues and relatives by the Nazis. An anecdote from Birgit Vennesland, who became a director at Warburg&#x27;s institute in West Berlin in 1968, is suggestive. She said that Warburg&#x27;s advice for an acquaintance who was experiencing emotional difficulties was &quot;Tell him not to think about anything but science—think about absolutely nothing else—only science.&quot;

In 1943 Warburg relocated his laboratory to the village of Liebenburg on the outskirts of Berlin to avoid ongoing air raids.
The Rockefeller Foundation reportedly offered to continue funding his work if he emigrated. After the war ended, Warburg inquiried about the prospect of moving to the United States, but was turned down.

==Nomination for a second Nobel Prize==

In 1944, Warburg was nominated for a second Nobel Prize in Physiology by Albert Szent-Györgyi, for his work on nicotinamide, the mechanism and enzymes involved in fermentation, and the discovery of flavin (in yellow enzymes). Some sources report that he was selected to receive the award that year, but was prevented from receiving it by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s regime, which had issued a decree in 1937 that forbade Germans from accepting Nobel Prizes. According to the Nobel Foundation, this rumor is not true; although he was considered a worthy candidate, he was not selected for the prize at that time.

Three scientists who worked in Warburg&#x27;s lab, including Sir Hans Adolf Krebs, went on to win the Nobel Prize in future years. Among other discoveries, Krebs is credited with the identification of the citric acid cycle (or Szent-Györgyi-Krebs cycle).

Warburg&#x27;s combined work in plant physiology, cell metabolism, and oncology made him an integral figure in the later development of systems biology. He worked with Dean Burk on the quantum yield of photosynthesis.

==Cancer hypothesis==

Warburg hypothesized that cancer growth is caused by tumor cells generating energy (as, e.g., adenosine triphosphate/ATP) mainly by anaerobic breakdown of glucose (known as fermentation, or anaerobic respiration). This is in contrast to healthy cells, which generate energy mainly from oxidative breakdown of pyruvate. Pyruvate is an end product of glycolysis and is oxidized within the mitochondria. Hence, according to Warburg, cancer should be interpreted as a mitochondrial dysfunction.

Warburg continued to develop the hypothesis experimentally and gave several prominent lectures outlining the theory and the data.

Today, mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are thought to be responsible for malignant transformation, and the metabolic changes Warburg thought of as causative are now considered to be a result of these mutations.

A recent reevaluation of the data from nuclear/cytoplasm transfer experiments, where nuclei from cancer cells are placed in normal cytoplasm and where nuclei from normal cells are placed in cancer cytoplasm, support the role of metabolism in cancer and the mitochondria in aiding tumor suppression. Still, as evident from the references therein, this promising phenomenon still fails to explain the origin of cancer as Warburg originally proposed. While Warburg&#x27;s hypothesis certainly inspired the scientific community to further investigate the field of cancer metabolism, his tendency to oversimplify perhaps prevented him from accepting the vastly complex role and interactions between both the mitochondria and nucleus, or more generally, metabolism and mutations.

==Later years==
Otto Warburg edited and had much of his original work published in &quot;The Metabolism of Tumours&quot; (tr. 1931) and wrote &quot;New Methods of Cell Physiology&quot; (1962). An unabashed anglophile, Otto Warburg was thrilled when Oxford University awarded him an honorary doctorate. He was awarded the Order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; in 1952 and was known to tell other universities not to bother with honorary doctorates. He would ask officials to mail him medals he had been awarded so as to avoid a ceremony that would separate him from his beloved laboratory.

When frustrated by the lack of acceptance of his ideas, Warburg was known to quote an aphorism he attributed to Max Planck: &quot;Science advances one funeral at a time&quot;.

Seemingly utterly convinced of the accuracy of his conclusions, Warburg expressed dismay at the &quot;continual discovery of cancer agents and cancer viruses&quot; that he expected to &quot;hinder necessary preventive measures and thereby become responsible for cancer cases&quot;.

When Josef Issels was tried and convicted for promoting the Issels treatment, an ineffective regimen claimed to treat cancer, Warburg offered to testify on Issels&#x27; behalf at his appeal to the German Supreme Court. All of Issels&#x27; convictions were overturned.

Warburg resided in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute with his companion of 50 years, Jacob Heiss, the secretary and manager of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Warburg pursued his research until the age of 86. He left his entire estate to Heiss.

In 1968, he suffered a broken femur. This was complicated by deep vein thrombosis. He died in 1970 from pulmonary embolism and was buried in a Christian cemetery.

==The Otto Warburg Medal==
The Otto Warburg Medal is intended to commemorate Warburg&#x27;s outstanding achievements. It has been awarded by the German Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (&quot;Gesellschaft für Biochemie und Molekularbiologie&quot;) since 1963. The prize honors and encourages pioneering achievements in fundamental biochemical and molecular biological research. The Otto Warburg Medal is regarded as the highest award in Germany for biochemists and molecular biologists. It has been endowed with prize money, sponsored by the publishing company Elsevier/BBA.

<doc id="240838" wikidata="Q3875969" url="?curid=240838" title="Nicholas Ferrar">
<text>Nicholas Ferrar (22 February 1592 – 4 December 1637) was an English scholar, courtier and businessman, who was ordained a deacon in the Church of England. He lost much of his fortune in the Virginia Company and retreated with his extended family in 1626 to the manor of Little Gidding, Huntingdonshire, for his remaining years, in an informal spiritual community following High Anglican practice. His friend the poet and Anglican priest George Herbert (1593–1633), on his deathbed, sent Ferrar the manuscript of &quot;The Temple&quot;, telling him to publish the poetry if it might &quot;turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul.&quot; &quot;If not, let him burn it; for I and it are less than the least of God&#x27;s mercies.&quot; Ferrar published the verses in 1633; they remain in print.

==Early life==
Nicholas Ferrar was born in the City of London, England the third son and fifth child (of six) of Nicholas Ferrar and his wife Mary Ferrar (&quot;née&quot; Wodenoth). He is sometimes identified as Nicholas Ferrar the Younger while his father is identified as Nicholas Ferrar the Elder. Having been sent to a nearby school, he is said to have been reading perfectly by the age of five. He was confirmed by the Bishop of London in 1598, contriving to have the bishop lay hands on him twice. In 1600 he was sent away to boarding school in Berkshire, and in 1605, aged 13, he entered Clare Hall, Cambridge. He was elected a fellow-commoner at the end of his first year, took his BA in 1610 and elected a fellow the following year.

==Travels abroad==
Ferrar suffered from poor health and was advised to travel to continental Europe, away from the damp air of Cambridge. He obtained a position in the retinue of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of James I who married the Elector Frederick V. In April 1613 he left England with the princess, not returning until 1618.

By May he had left the Court to travel alone. Over the next few years he visited the Dutch Republic, Austria, Bohemia, Italy and Spain, learning to speak Dutch, German, Italian and Spanish. He studied at Leipzig and especially at Padua, where he continued his medical studies. He met Anabaptists and Roman Catholics, including Jesuits and Oratorians, as well as Jews, broadening his religious education. During this time Ferrar recorded many adventures in his letters home to his family and friends. In 1618 he is said to have had a vision that he was needed at home, and so he returned to England.

==Virginia Company==

The Ferrar family was deeply involved in the Virginia Company of London. His family home was often visited by Sir Walter Raleigh, half-brother of Sir Humphrey Gilbert. Upon returning to London, Ferrar found that the family fortunes, primarily invested in Virginia, were under threat.

Ferrar entered the Parliament of England, serving briefly as Member of Parliament for Lymington in 1624, and worked with Sir Edwin Sandys. They were part of a parliamentary faction (the &quot;country party&quot; or &quot;patriot party&quot;) that seized control of the government&#x27;s finances from a rival &quot;court faction&quot;, and were grouped around Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. The court faction supported Sir Thomas Smythe (or Smith), also a prominent member of the East India Company. Smythe as treasurer of the Virginia Company from 1609 to 1620 encouraged the governor to end evangelisation of Native Americans and expand tobacco culture.

Ferrar wrote a 16-page pamphlet criticising Smythe&#x27;s management. Smythe (as he spelt his name) was criticised by rivals for allegedly skimming profits, but an investigation revealed no wrongdoing and he continued to enjoy the support of the king. The argument ended with the London Virginia Company losing its charter after a court decision in May 1624.

==At Little Gidding==
In 1626 Ferrar and his extended family left London and moved to the largely deserted village of Little Gidding in Huntingdonshire. The household centred on the Ferrar family: Nicholas&#x27;s mother, his brother John Ferrar (with his wife Bathsheba and their children), and his sister Susanna, with her husband John Collett and their children. They bought the manor of Little Gidding and restored the abandoned little church for their use. The household always had someone at prayer and had a strict routine. They tended to the health and education of local children. Ferrar and his family produced harmonies of the Gospels that survive today as some of the finest in Britain. Many of the family also learned the art of bookbinding, apparently from the daughter of a Cambridge bookbinder, whose style they worked in.

In 1633 the poet George Herbert, on his deathbed, sent the manuscript of &quot;The Temple&quot; to Nicholas Ferrar, telling him to publish the poems if he thought they might &quot;turn to the advantage of any dejected poor soul&quot;, and otherwise, to burn them. Ferrar arranged to publish them that year. &quot;The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations&quot; (1633) had gone through eight editions by 1690.

Nicholas Ferrar died on 4 December 1637 aged 45, but the extended family continued their way of life without him. After his siblings John Ferrar and Susanna Ferrar Collett died in 1657 within a month of each other, the larger community began to disband.

Puritans criticised the life of the Ferrar household, denouncing them as Arminians, and saying they lived as in a &quot;Protestant nunnery&quot;. However, the Ferrars never lived a formal &quot;religious&quot; life: there was no Rule, vows were not taken, and there was no enclosure. In this sense there was no &quot;community&quot; at Little Gidding, but rather a family living a Christian life in accordance with the Book of Common Prayer, according to High Church principles.

The fame of the Ferrar household was widespread, and attracted many visitors. Among them was King Charles I, who visited Little Gidding three times. He briefly took refuge there in 1645 after the Battle of Naseby.

==Legacy and honours==

Nicholas Ferrar is commemorated in the calendar of the Church of England on 4 December, the date of his death. In the calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and the Church in Wales, he is commemorated on 1 December.

T. S. Eliot honoured Nicholas Ferrar in the &quot;Four Quartets&quot;, naming one of the quartets &quot;Little Gidding&quot;. The Friends of Little Gidding were founded in 1946 by Alan Maycock with the patronage of Eliot, to maintain and adorn the church at Little Gidding, and honour the life of Ferrar and his family and their place in the village. The Friends organise an annual pilgrimage to Ferrar&#x27;s tomb, formerly held each July, but in recent years in May (the month when Eliot visited Little Gidding) and celebrate Nicholas Ferrar Day on the Saturday nearest to 4 December.

A new religious community was founded at Little Gidding in the 1970s, inspired by the example of Ferrar and called the Community of Christ the Sower, but it disbanded in 1998. The Pilsdon Community in Dorset was also based on Ferrar&#x27;s Little Gidding model.

The former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes was directly related to Nicholas Ferrar on his mother&#x27;s side. Hughes and his wife, the poet Sylvia Plath, named their son Nicholas Farrar Hughes. The family evidently used both spellings of the surname.

Nicholas Ferrar is regarded as patron of the Oratory of the Good Shepherd, an international Anglican religious community.

<text>Bobbejaanland is a theme park in Lichtaart, Belgium. The park was founded by Bobbejaan Schoepen, a Flemish singer, guitarist, and entertainer who enjoyed international success in the fifties and early sixties. In 1959, he bought a 30 hectare marsh, had it drained and built a 1,000 capacity venue that opened in December 1961 as Bobbejaanland. This developed into an amusement park and remained in his possession until he sold it in 2004.

==History==
=== 20th century: Independent amusement park ===
For its first decade after opening the park centered on water attractions and performance spaces. Numerous variety artists from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany appeared there. Following the advice of Phantasialand owner Gottlieb Löffelhard, Bobbejaanland evolved from 1975 onwards into a theme park, with rides becoming more important than music shows. It grew to fifty attractions with four hundred employees and received visitors from the Benelux countries, France, and Germany. As an independent family concern, it also supported educational and cultural projects. By the end of the seventies, Schoepen&#x27;s wife Josée (a former opera singer and model) opened a museum with works of art from the Hopi and Navajo cultures, forming an extensive private collection of Native American art.

From the 1990s, three of his five children worked for the park. It added a high windmill that provides the region with energy, and an adjoining museum of alternative energy generation.

=== 21st century: A Parques Reunidos park ===
In the winter of 2003, the park invested 12 million dollars (almost 11 million euros) in two new rides named the Typhoon and the Sledge Hammer. In a 2004 survey of 13 European amusement parks by Belgian consumer organisation &quot;Test-Aankoop&quot; Bobbejaanland was rated second after Phantasialand.

In the early 2000s, the founder was diagnosed with cancer and he sold Bobbejaanland to the Spanish-American Parques Reunidos group in April 2004.

==Attractions==

Bobbejaanland contains about 50 attractions, such as the Waterslide (1980), the Giant wheel (1976), Indiana River (indoor flume ride, 1991), the Revolution (a dark Rollercoaster, 1989), the Speedy Bob (roller coaster, 1998), the Air Race (suspended roller coaster, 1987, now named Dreamcatcher), the longest junior roller coaster in the world, &#x27;Okidoki&#x27; (i.e. &#x27;that&#x27;s all right&#x27;, 2003–04), and the world&#x27;s second Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter roller coaster, &quot;Typhoon&quot; (2003–04), with a drop angle of over 97°(a roller coaster with a fourfold loop and a free fall) and a Splash Battle, &quot;Banana Battle&quot;, (2007) made by Preston &amp; Barbieri. The giant Sledgehammer (a Giant Frisbee) reaches a speed of 110 km/h). In 1995 &#x27;Kinderland&#x27; (English: Kids&#x27; Country) was opened as an area for young children.

In 1979, Bobbejaanland opened the Looping Star roller coaster (Schwarzkopf GmbH). Although the ride had a security bar placed over the hip, it was more the centrifugal force which held the passengers in the vehicle when it looped the loop. The coaster was dismantled in 2003.

Bobbejaanland also has Revolution: a fully enclosed tubular steel roller coaster manufactured by Vekoma, with world&#x27;s largest train where two passengers can sit bobsled style per car. In 2016, the attraction was equipped with Samsung Gear VR. In the morning, the original ride was active. In the afternoon, passengers had the option to wear the virtual glasses and the ride was about an escape from the erupting volcano &quot;Mount Mara&quot;. Due to this concept only one passenger per car could wear the glasses. Physical limitations prohibited children to wear the glasses as they didn&#x27;t fit on their head.

Because Bobbejaan Schoepen was primarily a folk and country singer, the park is still partly themed as a western village (for example the El Rio White Water Rapids and the El Paso Dark ride). In the Star Theater, Las Vegas style shows are performed. Bobbejaan bought Zorro&#x27;s horse from stuntman Casey Tibbs, but the animal was accidentally electrocuted by an exposed cable. He also acquired an ornate white Pontiac Nudie mobile decorated with American coins.

<text>The South China Sea Islands consist of over 250 islands, atolls, cays, shoals, reefs, and seamounts in the South China Sea. The islands are mostly low and small and have few inhabitants. The islands and surrounding seas are subject to overlapping territorial claims by the countries bordering the South China Sea.

The South China Sea Islands constitute a distinct tropical moist broadleaf forest terrestrial ecoregion and the South China Sea Oceanic Islands marine ecoregion.

==Geography==
The islands, shoals and reefs are grouped into three archipelagos, plus the Zhongsha Islands (Macclesfield Bank and Scarborough Shoal). The South China Sea Islands as defined here consist of the sea&#x27;s oceanic islands but do not include the sea&#x27;s continental shelf islands (like Hainan and Natuna). Collectively, they have a total land surface area of less than at low tide. The island groups include:

* The Paracel Islands, disputed between the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of China (ROC, a.k.a. Taiwan), and Vietnam. Occupied by the PRC following the Battle of the Paracel Islands (1974).
* Pratas Island and the Vereker Banks, disputed between the PRC and the ROC, occupied by the ROC.
* The Spratly Islands, disputed between the PRC, the ROC, and Vietnam (and to a lesser degree by Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines, claiming various parts of the archipelago).
** James Shoal
** Taiping Island
** Zhongzhou Reef
* The Zhongsha Islands
** Macclesfield Bank (with no land above sea level), disputed between the PRC, the ROC and the Philippines.
*** Walker Shoal
** Scarborough Shoal (with only rocks above sea level), disputed between the PRC, the ROC, and the Philippines.
**Truro Shoal (Sianfa Ansha or Shianfa Ansha 特魯暗沙; 16°20′N 116°44′E)

=== Geology ===


The geology has been extensively studied because of exploitable resources such as oil and gas and is complex. The sea floor contains Paleozoic and Mesozoic granite and metamorphic rocks.

The islands are usually coral reefs of varying ages and formations. Some have been artificially extended. In the Spratly Islands Reed Tablemount is a very large guyot over across, which includes Reed Bank and Nares Bank in its geological structure. The second deepest blue hole (underwater sinkhole) in the world is in the Paracel Islands at Dragon Hole.

==Climate==
The Paracel islands have a tropical marine climate. Annual rainfall averages and is strongly seasonal. Between May and August, the southwest trade winds bring rainfall to the islands, with the maximum rainfall in June (). The northeast trade winds bring a winter dry season, and December is the lowest-rainfall month ().

The Spratly Islands have a tropical climate. The average annual temperature is and ranges from between May and August to during the winter months. Rainfall averages annually. The southwest monsoon from May to November brings a five-month rainy season, and the seven-month dry season includes the March to April southeast monsoon.

==Flora==
Many of the smaller islands are devoid of vegetation. Larger islands support terrestrial plant communities which include coral island evergreen forest, scrub forest and coastal scrub and grasses.

There are 340 species of land plants and fungi recorded in the Paracel Islands, composed of 224 genera in 89 plant families. These include 312 species of flowering plants (angiosperms) and five species of pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies), along with 22 species of macrofungi (larger fungi) and one lichen species. The flora of the Paracel Islands is similar to that of Hainan Island to the north.

Humans have introduced other plants to the islands. The Chinese and Vietnamese introduced 47 more species, including peanut, sweet potato and various vegetables.

==Fauna==
There are no known native terrestrial animals on the islands.

The islands are feeding and nesting sites for large numbers of seabirds, including the streaked shearwater (&quot;Calonectris leucomelas&quot;), brown booby (&quot;Sula leucogaster&quot;), red-footed booby (&quot;S. sula&quot;), great crested tern (&quot;Sterna bergii&quot;) and white tern (&quot;Gygis alba&quot;). Seabird faeces can accumulate to annually. Over time, they create thick deposits of guano.

Green sea turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) and hawksbill sea turtles (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;) inhabit waters around the islands and nest on the islands&#x27; beaches.

== History ==
From 1405 to 1433, Zheng He commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa in Ming dynasty in China. 
In 1421, Zheng prepared the 6 edition Mao Kun map, usually referred to by Chinese people as Zheng He&#x27;s Navigation Map (), which included South China Sea Islands.

In the 19th century, as a part of the occupation of Indochina, France claimed control of the Spratlys until the 1930s, exchanging a few with the British. During World War II, the South China Sea islands were all occupied by Japan.
The People&#x27;s Republic of China, founded in 1949, claimed the islands as part of the province of Canton (Guangdong), and later of the Hainan special administrative region.

=== Names ===
The South China Sea Islands were discussed from the 4th century BC in the Chinese texts &quot;Yizhoushu&quot;, &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, and &quot;Guoyu&quot;, but only implicitly as part of the &quot;Southern Territories&quot; () or &quot;South Sea&quot; (, &quot;Nán Hǎi&quot;). During the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), government administrators called the South China Sea Islands the &quot;Three Mysterious Groups of Islands&quot; (, &quot;Sān Shén Shān&quot;). But during the Eastern Han dynasty (23–220), the South China Sea was renamed &quot;Rising Sea&quot; (, &quot;Zhǎng Hǎi&quot;), so the islands were called the &quot;Rising Sea Islands&quot; (, &quot;Zhǎnghǎi Qítóu&quot;). During the Jin dynasty (266–420), they were known as the &quot;Coral Islands&quot; (, &quot;Shānhú Zhōu&quot;). From the Tang dynasty (618–907) to the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), various names were used for the islands, but in general &quot;Changsha&quot; and permutations referred to the Paracel Islands, while &quot;Shitang&quot; referred to the Spratly Islands. These variations included, for the Paracels: &quot;Jiǔrǔ Luózhōu&quot; (), &quot;Qīzhōu Yáng&quot; (), &quot;Chángshā&quot; (), &quot;Qiānlǐ Chángshā&quot; (), and &quot;Qiānlǐ Shítáng&quot; (); for the Spratlys: &quot;Shítáng&quot; (), &quot;Shíchuáng&quot; (), &quot;Wànlǐ Shítáng&quot; (), and &quot;Wànlǐ Chángshā&quot; ().

During the Qing, the names &quot;Qianli Changsha&quot; and &quot;Wanli Shitang&quot; were in vogue, and Chinese fishermen from Hainan named specific islands from within the groups, although the Qing officially named 15 large islands in 1909. During China&#x27;s Republican era (1912–1949), the government named the Spratlys &quot;Tuánshā Qúndǎo&quot; () and then &quot;Nánshā Qúndǎo&quot; (); the Paracels were &quot;Xīshā Qúndǎo&quot; (); Republican authorities mapped over 291 islands, reefs, and banks in surveys in 1932, 1935, and 1947. The People&#x27;s Republic of China has retained the Republican-era names for the island groups, supplementing them with a list of 287 names for islands, reefs, banks, and shoals in 1983. From 2011 to 2012, China&#x27;s State Oceanic Administration named 1,660 nameless islands and islets under its claimed jurisdiction; in 2012, China announced plans to name a further 1,664 nameless features by August 2013. The naming campaign is intended to consolidate China&#x27;s sovereignty claim over Sansha (), a city which includes islands from the &quot;Xisha&quot; (Paracel), &quot;Nansha&quot; (Spratly and James Shoal) and &quot;Zhongsha&quot; (, &quot;Zhōngshā&quot;; Macclesfield Bank, Scarborough Shoal, and others) groups.

==Resources==
There are minerals, natural gas and oil deposits on the islands and under their nearby seafloor, also an abundance of sea life, such as fish, animals and vegetation, traditionally exploited as food by all the claimant nations for thousands of years—mostly without disputes that could risk war. In the 20th century, since the WW2 settlements failed to resolve ownership of such lesser areas of land, seas and islands—and because of the economic, military, and transportational importance—their control, especially that of the Spratlys, has been in dispute between China and several Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, from the mid-20th century onwards. True occupation and control are shared between the claimants (see claims and control below).

== Claims and control ==


The Republic of China (ROC) named 132 of the South China Sea Islands in 1932 and 1935. In 1933, the Chinese government lodged an official protest to the French government after its occupation of Taiping Island. In 1947, the Ministry of Interior of China renamed 149 of the islands. Later, in November 1947, the Secretaritat of Guangdong Government of China was authorised to publish the &quot;Map of the South China Sea Islands&quot;.

The Japanese and the French renounced their claims as soon as their respective occupations or colonization had ended.

In 1958, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) issued a declaration defining its territorial waters within what is known as the nine-dash line which encompassed the Spratly Islands. North Vietnam&#x27;s prime minister, Phạm Văn Đồng, sent a diplomatic note to Zhou Enlai, stating that &quot;The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam respects this decision.&quot; The diplomatic note was written on 14 September and was publicised in &quot;Nhan Dan&quot; newspaper (Vietnam) on 22 September 1958. Regarding this letter, there have been many arguments on its true meaning and the reason why Phạm Văn Đồng decided to send it to Zhou Enlai. In an interview with BBC Vietnam, Dr. Balázs Szalontai provided the following analysis of this issue:

It was also argued that, Phạm Văn Đồng who represented North Vietnam at that time had no legal right to comment on a territorial part which belonged to the South Vietnam represented by Ngo Dinh Diem. Therefore, the letter has no legal value and is considered as a diplomatic document to show the support of the government of North Vietnam to the PRC at that time. In China, in 1959, the islands were put under an administrative office (办事处/&quot;banshichu&quot;). In 1988, the office was switched to the administration of the newly founded Hainan Province. The PRC strongly asserted its claims to the islands, but in the late 1990s, under the new security concept, the PRC put its claims less strongly. According to the Kyodo News, in March 2010 PRC officials told US officials that they consider the South China Sea a &quot;core interest&quot; on par with Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. In July 2010, the Communist Party-controlled Global Times stated that &quot;China will never waive its right to protect its core interest with military means&quot; and a Ministry of Defense spokesman said that &quot;China has indisputable sovereignty of the South Sea and China has sufficient historical and legal backing&quot; to underpin its claims. China added a tenth-dash line to the east of Taiwan island in 2013 as a part of its official sovereignty claim to the disputed territories in the South China Sea.

In addition to the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Vietnam, the Republic of China (i.e. Taiwan), Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines also claim and occupy some islands. Taiwan claims all the Spratly Islands, but occupies only one island and one shelf, including Taiping Island. Malaysia occupies three islands on its continental shelf. The Philippines claim most of the Spratlys and calls them the Kalayaan Group of islands, and they form a distinct municipality in the province of Palawan. The Philippines, however, occupy only eight islands. Brunei claims a relatively small area, including islands on Louisa Reef.

Indonesia&#x27;s claims are not on any island, but on maritime rights. (See South China Sea)

In July 2016, in Philippines v. China, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines. It clarified that it would not &quot;...rule on any question of sovereignty over land territory and would not delimit any maritime boundary between the Parties&quot;. The tribunal also ruled that China has &quot;no historical rights&quot; based on the &quot;nine-dash line&quot; map. China has rejected the ruling, as has Taiwan.

<text>Sir Henry Hallett Dale (9 June 1875 – 23 July 1968) was an English pharmacologist and physiologist. For his study of acetylcholine as agent in the chemical transmission of nerve pulses (neurotransmission) he shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Otto Loewi.

==Early life and education==
Henry Hallett Dale was born in Islington, London, to Charles James Dale, a pottery manufacturer from Staffordshire, and his wife, Frances Anne Hallett, daughter of a furniture manufacturer, from South Devon. Henry was the third of seven children, one of whom (his younger brother, Benjamin Dale) became an accomplished composer and warden of the Royal Academy of Music. Henry was educated at the local Tollington Park College and then The Leys School Cambridge (one of the school&#x27;s houses is named after him) and in 1894 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, working under the physiologist John Langley. For a few months in 1903 he also studied under Paul Ehrlich in Frankfurt, Germany. Also in 1903, Dale assisted Ernest Starling and William Bayliss in the vivisection of a dog, by removing the dog&#x27;s pancreas and then killing the dog with a knife, which ultimately led to the events of the Brown Dog affair. Dale received his Doctor of Medicine degree from Cambridge in 1909.

==Career and research==
While working at the University College London, he met and became friends with Otto Loewi. Dale became the director of the Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology at the National Institute for Medical Research in London in 1914. He became a Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution in 1942. During World War II he served on the scientific advisory panel to the Cabinet.

Although Dale and his colleagues first identified acetylcholine in 1914 as a possible neurotransmitter, Loewi showed its importance in the nervous system. The two men shared the 1936 Nobel Prize for Medicine.

During the 1940s Dale was embroiled in the scientific debate over the nature of signaling at the synapse. Dale and others believed that signaling at the synapse was chemical, while John Carew Eccles and others believed that the synapse was electrical. It was later found that most synaptic signalling is chemical, but there are some synapses that are electrical.

Dale also originated the scheme used to differentiate neurons according to the neurotransmitters they release. Thus, neurons releasing noradrenaline (known in the United States as norepinephrine) are called noradrenergic, neurons releasing GABA are GABAergic, and so on. This is called &quot;Dale&#x27;s principle&quot; (sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;Dale&#x27;s Law&quot;), one interpretation of which holds that each neuron releases only one type of neurotransmitter. This particular interpretation of Dale&#x27;s principle has been shown to be false, as many neurons release neuropeptides and amino acids in addition to classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine or biogenic amines (see cotransmission) (Bear, et al. 2001). This finding, that numerous neurotransmitters can be released by the same neuron, is referred to as the &quot;coexistence principle.&quot; This phenomenon was most popularized by the Swedish neuroanatomist and neuropharmacologist Tomas Hökfelt, who is considered to be the &quot;Father of the Coexistence Principle.&quot;

Between 1938 and 1960 Dale served as chairman of the Wellcome Trust.

===Awards and honours===
Dale was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1914. In 1926, he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1927, the American Philosophical Society in 1939, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1940. He was knighted in 1932, receiving the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1943 and the Order of Merit in 1944. He served as president of the Royal Society from 1940 to 1945 and president of the Royal Society of Medicine from 1948 to 1950. The Sir Henry Dale Fellowships of the Wellcome Trust are named in his honour and the Society for Endocrinology awards the Dale Medal annually in his honour.

==Personal life==
In 1904, Dale had married his first cousin Ellen Harriett Hallett and had a son and two daughters. One of their daughters, Alison Sarah Dale, married Alexander R. Todd, who won the 1957 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and served as President of the Royal Society from 1975 to 1980. The Dales lived at Mount Vernon House from 1919 to 1942.

Dales&#x27;s residency at the house is marked by a Greater London Council blue plaque erected in 1981 on the garden wall of the house.

<text>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), formerly known as TNF-α, is a chemical messenger produced by the immune system that induces inflammation. TNF is produced primarily by activated macrophages, and induces inflammation by binding to its receptors on other cells. It is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, a family of transmembrane proteins that are cytokines, chemical messengers of the immune system. Excessive production of TNF plays a critical role in several inflammatory diseases, and TNF-blocking drugs are often employed to treat these diseases.

TNF is produced primarily by macrophages but is also produced in several other cell types, such as T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells. It is produced rapidly in response to pathogens, cytokines, and environmental stressors. TNF is initially produced as a type II transmembrane protein (tmTNF), which is then cleaved by TNF alpha converting enzyme (TACE) into a soluble form (sTNF) and secreted from the cell. Three TNF molecules assemble together to form an active homotrimer, whereas individual TNF molecules are inert.

When TNF binds to its receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), a pathway of signals is triggered within the target cell, resulting in an inflammatory response. sTNF can only activate TNFR1, whereas tmTNF can activate both TNFR1 and TNFR2, as well as trigger inflammatory signaling pathways within its own cell. TNF&#x27;s effects on the immune system include the activation of white blood cells, blood coagulation, secretion of cytokines, and fever. TNF also contributes to homeostasis in the central nervous system.

Inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease can be effectively treated by drugs that inhibit TNF from binding to its receptors. TNF is also implicated in the pathology of other diseases including cancer, liver fibrosis, and Alzheimer&#x27;s, although TNF inhibition has yet to show definitive benefits.

== History ==
In the 1890s, William Coley observed that acute infections could cause tumor regression, leading to his usage of bacterial toxins as a cancer treatment. In 1944, endotoxin was isolated from Coley&#x27;s bacterial toxins as the substance responsible for the anticancer effect. In particular, endotoxin could cause tumor regression when injected into mice with experimentally induced cancers. In 1975, Carswell et al. discovered that endotoxin did not directly cause tumor regression, but instead induced macrophages to secrete a substance that causes tumors to hemorrhage and necrotize, termed &quot;tumor necrosis factor.&quot;

In the 1980s, TNF was purified, sequenced, and cloned in bacteria. Studies on recombinant TNF confirmed the anticancer potential of TNF, but this optimism faded when TNF injections were found to induce endotoxin shock. TNF was also discovered to be the same protein as cachectin, known to cause muscle wasting in mice. These findings demonstrated that TNF could be detrimental in excessive quantities. In 1992, TNF antibodies were found to reduce joint inflammation in mice, revealing TNF&#x27;s role in inflammatory diseases. This led to the approval of the first anti-TNF therapy for rheumatoid arthritis in 1998.

=== Nomenclature ===
In 1985, TNF was found to have significant sequential and functional similarity with lymphotoxin, a previously discovered cytokine. This led to the renaming of TNF to TNF-α and lymphotoxin to TNF-β. However, in 1993, a protein with close similarity to lymphotoxin was discovered, termed lymphotoxin-β. In 1998, at the Seventh International TNF Congress, TNF-β was officially renamed to lymphotoxin-α, while TNF-α was renamed back to TNF. Nevertheless, some papers continue to use the term TNF-α.

== Evolution ==
The TNF and lymphotoxin-α genes are believed to be descended from a common ancestor gene that developed early in vertebrate evolution, before the Agnatha and Gnathostomata split. This ancestor gene was dropped from the Agnatha ancestor but persisted in the Gnathostomata ancestor. During the evolution of gnathostomes, this ancestor gene was duplicated into the TNF and lymphotoxin-α genes. Thus, while the ancestor gene is found across a variety of gnathostome species, only a subset of gnathostome species contain a TNF gene. Some fish species, such as Danio, have been found to contain duplicates of the TNF gene.

The TNF gene is very similar among mammals, ranging from 233 to 235 amino acids. The TNF proximal promoter region is also highly conserved among mammals, and nearly identical among higher primates. The similarity of the TNF gene among fish is lower, ranging from 226 to 256 amino acids. Like mammalian TNF, the fish TNF gene has been shown to be stimulated in macrophages by antigens. All TNF genes have a highly conserved C-terminal module known as the TNF homology domain, due to its important role in binding TNF to its receptors.

== Gene ==
=== Location ===
The human TNF gene is mapped to chromosome 6p21.3, residing in the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex, where many immune system genes are contained. The class III region is sandwiched between the HLA-DR locus on the centromeric side, and the HLA-B locus on the telomeric side. The TNF gene is 250 kilobases away from the HLA-B locus, and 850 kilobases away from the HLA-DR locus. The TNF gene is located 1,100 kilobases downstream of the lymphotoxin-α gene.

=== Expression ===
TNF is produced rapidly in response to many stimuli by multiple cell types. Cell types that express TNF include T cells, B cells, macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts, and stimuli that activate the TNF gene include pathogenic substances, cytokines from other immune cells, and environment stressors. A few such cytokines include interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and TNF itself. TNF transcription is activated by a variety of signaling pathways and transcription factors, depending on the cell type and stimulus. TNF transcription does not depend on the synthesis of new proteins, enabling rapid activation of the gene.

TNF gene expression is regulated by a proximal promoter region consisting of approximately 200 base pairs. Most of the binding sites within the proximal promoter region can recognize multiple transcription factors, enabling TNF to be activated by a variety of signaling pathways. As transcription factors bind to the promoter region, they also bind to coactivators, assembling into a large structure known as an enhanceosome. The composition of the enhanceosome depends on ambient factors within the cell, particularly nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT).

TNF expression is also regulated by DNA structure. DNA is coiled around histones, which is loosened by acetylation and condensed by methylation. Proteins that acetylate histones at the TNF promoter, particularly CREB-binding protein in T cells, are often critical for TNF expression. In contrast, several cell types that do not express TNF are highly methylated at the histones of the TNF promoter. Long-range intrachromosomal interactions can also regulate TNF expression. In activated T-cells, the DNA surrounding the TNF promoter circularizes, bringing promoter complexes closer together and enhancing transcription efficiency.

=== Transcription ===

The transcribed region contains 4 exons separated by 3 introns, for a total of 2,762 base pairs in the primary transcript and 1,669 base pairs in the mRNA. The mRNA consists of four regions: the 5&#x27; untranslated region, which is not included in the TNF protein; the transmembrane portion, which is present in transmembrane TNF but not in soluble TNF; the soluble portion; and the 3&#x27; untranslated region. More than 80% of the soluble portion is contained in the last exon, while the transmembrane portion is contained in the first two exons. The 3&#x27; untranslated region contains an AU-rich element (ARE) that regulates the translation of TNF. In unstimulated macrophages, various proteins bind to the ARE to destabilize TNF mRNA, suppressing the translation of TNF. Upon activation, TNF translation is unsuppressed.

== Protein ==
TNF is initially produced as a transmembrane protein (tmTNF) consisting of 233 amino acids. tmTNF binds to both TNFR1 and TNFR2, but its activity is primarily mediated by TNFR2. Upon binding to a receptor, tmTNF also activates signaling pathways within its own cell. tmTNF is cleaved by TNF alpha converting enzyme (TACE), which causes the extracellular portion to be secreted. After cleavage, the remaining tmTNF is cleaved again by SPPL2B, causing the intracellular portion to translocate to the nucleus. There, it is believed to regulate cytokine production, such as triggering the expression of interleukin-12.

The secreted extracellular portion, denoted sTNF, consists of 157 amino acids. Unlike tmTNF, sTNF can only bind to TNFR1. The secondary structure of sTNF consists primarily of alternating strands that join into two sheets, known as antiparallel β-sheets. The two sheets are layered on top of each other, forming a wedge shape known as an antiparallel β-sandwich. Remarkably, this structure is similar to those seen on the coats of viruses. The last 9 residues of the C-terminus are locked into the middle strand of the bottom sheet, and are necessary for bioactivity.

Both tmTNF and sTNF are only bioactive as homotrimers, whereas individual monomers are inactive. The rate at which TNF trimers disassemble is constant, whereas the rate at which TNF trimers assemble increases with TNF concentration. This causes TNF to be mostly trimers at high concentrations, whereas TNF is mostly monomers and dimers at low concentrations. The coexistence of TNF dimers and trimers in dynamic equilibrium suggests that TNF might be a morpheein. Small molecules that stabilize TNF dimers and prevent the assembly of TNF trimers present a potential mechanism for inhibiting TNF.

== Function ==
TNF is a central mediator of the body&#x27;s innate immune response. By binding to receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2, TNF can induce either cell survival or cell death in a target cell. The cell survival response includes cell proliferation and the activation of inflammatory signals, while the cell death response can either be apoptosis, the controlled death of the cell, or necroptosis, a less controlled death causing inflammation and interference in surrounding tissue. TNF induces cell survival by default, but cell death can be induced by factors such as disruption of inflammatory pathways by pathogens, co-stimulation with other cytokines, and cross-talk between TNFR1 and TNFR2. Additionally, transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) acts as a reverse signaler, triggering a variety of responses in its own cell depending on cell type and stimulant.

=== TNFR1 signaling ===

TNFR1 exists in most cell types and binds to both tmTNF and sTNF. TNFR1 contains a death domain in its cytoplasmic tail, enabling it to trigger cell death. Whether TNFR1 activation triggers cell survival or cell death is mediated by the formation of protein complexes: complex I, which leads to cell survival, and complex II, which leads to cell death. By default, TNFR1 activation triggers cell proliferation and inflammation rather than cell death. These inflammatory pathways contain three cell death checkpoints, each of which is critical in preventing cell death.

Upon activation by TNF, TNFR1 trimerizes and forms complex I by recruiting RIPK1 and TRADD, which recruits TRAF2, cIAP1 and cIAP2, and LUBAC. cIAP1 and cIAP2 are ubiquitin ligases that form K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which recruit TAK1 via TAB2 and TAB3. LUBAC is also a ubiquitin ligase that forms M1-linked ubiquitin chains, which attract IKK via NEMO. TAK1 activates the MAPK pathways, as well as IKK, which in turn activates the canonical NF-κB pathway. The MAPK pathways and the NF-κB pathway activate multiple transcription factors in the nucleus, which result in cell survival, proliferation, and inflammatory response. Complex I is negatively regulated by deubiquitinases such as A20, CYLD, and OTULIN, which destabilize complex I.

Complex II is formed when RIPK1 and/or TRADD disassociate from complex I and bind with FADD to activate caspase 8, leading to cell death. Complex IIa includes TRADD and can activate caspase 8 without RIPK1, while complex IIb does not include TRADD, so it is dependent on RIPK1 for the activation of caspase 8. The pathways of complex I induce three checkpoints that prevent complex II from inducing cell death.

In the first checkpoint, IKK disables RIPK1 via phosphorylation while it is attached to complex I. This disables complex IIb, which is dependent on RIPK1. Since IKK is dependent on the ubiquitination of complex I, conditions that affect ubiquitination, such as inhibition of cIAP1/2 and LUBAC, mutation of the RIPK1 ubiquitin acceptor site, or deficiencies of A20 and OUTLIN, can disable this checkpoint. The disabling of the IKK checkpoint activates complex IIb, leading to apoptosis, or pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD. The disabling of the IKK checkpoint can also indirectly activate complex IIa by disabling the NF-κB pathway, which controls the second checkpoint.

In the second checkpoint, the NF-κB pathway promotes the expression of pro-survival genes such as FLIP, which counteracts the activation of caspase 8 in complex IIa. This checkpoint can be disabled by translation inhibitors such as cycloheximide, as well as by the disabling of the IKK complex, which controls the NF-κB pathway. The disabling of this checkpoint activates complex IIa, leading to apoptosis.

In the third checkpoint, non-lethal caspase 8 is activated by TNFR1 signalling, which binds to complex IIb and cleaves RIPK1, disabling it. It is unknown why this form of caspase 8 does not cause cell death. The disabling of this checkpoint, via inactivation of caspase 8, causes RIPK1 from complex IIb to bind to RIPK3 and MLKL, forming complex IIc, also referred to as the necrosome. The necrosome then causes necroptosis.

=== TNFR2 signaling ===

Unlike TNFR1, TNFR2 is expressed in limited cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and subsets of neurons and immune cells. TNFR2 is only fully activated by tmTNF, while activation by sTNF is partially inhibited. Unlike TNFR1, TNFR2 does not possess a death domain, so it is incapable of directly inducing cell death. Thus, TNFR2 activation most often leads to cell survival. Cell survival can either lead to an inflammatory response, via canonical NF-κB activation, or cell proliferation, via non-canonical NF-κB activation, depending on intracellular conditions and the signaling process of TNFR1. TNFR2 can also indirectly cause cell death by disrupting the cell death checkpoints of TNFR1.

Upon binding to tmTNF, TNFR2 trimerizes and directly recruits TRAF2, as well as TRAF1 or TRAF3. TRAF2 is central to the TNFR2 signaling complex and recruits cIAP1/2. If there is an accumulation of NIK within the cell, TRAF2/3 and cIAP1/2 may be formed as a complex with inactive NIK. When TRAF2/3 binds to TNFR2, the attached NIK is activated, which in turn activates IKKα. This allows p100 and RelB to be processed into a heterodimer which activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, leading to cell proliferation. The expression of p100 and RelB is potentiated by the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway by TNFR1. Thus, TNFR2 non-canonical NF-κB activation is dependent on the canonical NF-κB activation by TNFR1, as well as the accumulation of NIK within the cell.

TNFR2 can also activate the canonical NF-κB pathway, though this is less common than non-canonical NF-κB activation. The details of TNFR2&#x27;s activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway are unknown. Presumably, TAK1 and IKK are recruited by the TRAF2 / TRAF1/3 / cIAP1/2 signalling complex, which in turn activates the canonical NF-κB pathway.

TNFR2 can indirectly induce cell death by degrading cIAP1/2 as part of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. The degradation of cIAP1/2 affects the ubiquitination of the TNFR1 signalling complex, which inhibits the function of IKK. This disables the IKK cell death checkpoint in TNFR1, inducing cell death.

=== Reverse signalling ===
tmTNF can act as a receptor, activating pathways within its own cell upon binding to TNFR1 or TNFR2. tmTNF reverse signalling can induce apoptosis, apoptosis resistance, inflammation, or inflammation resistance depending on the ligand and cell type.

In tumor cells, such as B lymphoma cells, tmTNF reverse signalling has been shown to increase NF-κB activity, enhancing cell survival and apoptosis resistance. In natural killer cells, tmTNF reverse signalling increases cytotoxic activity by increasing the expression of perforin, granzyme B, Fas ligand, and TNF. In T cells, the activation of the JNK pathway by tmTNF reverse signalling can lead to cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis.

In monocytes, tmTNF has been shown to play a dual role in mediating the monocyte&#x27;s inflammatory response to sTNF. If tmTNF reverse signalling occurs before a monocyte is activated by sTNF, then the monocyte&#x27;s inflammatory response to sTNF is enhanced. If tmTNF reverse signalling occurs after a monocyte is activated by sTNF, then the inflammatory response is reduced. Meanwhile, tmTNF reverse signalling reduces a monocyte&#x27;s inflammatory response to endotoxin. This effect is caused by tmTNF activating the JNK and p38 pathways, which induces TGF-β production, which then interferes with the signalling pathway of endotoxin.

=== Immune response ===
The innate immune system is the immune system&#x27;s first line of defense, responding rapidly and nonspecifically to invading pathogens. It is activated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as endotoxins and double-stranded viral RNA, bind to the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of immune cells, causing them to secrete immune-regulating cytokines. These cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF, are primarily secreted by immune cells that engulf bacteria, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. They mainly act on white blood cells, as well as on endothelial cells in blood vessels to promote an early inflammatory response.

TNF is the principal cytokine for regulating acute inflammation, though many of its functions are shared with other cytokines, especially IL-1. By binding to TNF receptors, TNF can perform functions including stimulating endothelial cells to induce coagulation, which obstructs blood flow to prevent the spread of microbes; stimulating endothelial cells and macrophages to secrete chemokines that attract white blood cells; stimulating the secretion of other cytokines such as IL-1; activating neutrophils and macrophages; stimulating the liver to produce acute phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein; inducing catabolism of muscles and fat to produce energy; and stimulating scar tissue formation, also known as fibrosis. In addition to inducing the secretion of cytokines, TNF itself can be induced by cytokines, enabling a cascade of inflammatory signals. Excessive amounts of TNF can cause septic shock.

Much of TNF&#x27;s functions are mediated through inflammatory signalling pathways, such as MAPK and NF-κB. Many pathogens attempt to prevent an immune response by hijacking cells and disrupting their inflammatory pathways. In response to this, the TNFR1 signalling pathway has cell death pathways that are inhibited by the activities of the inflammatory pathways. If a cell&#x27;s inflammatory pathways are disrupted, the cell death pathways are uninhibited, triggering cell death. This prevents the pathogen from replicating within the cell, as well as alerting the immune system.

Additionally, TNF induces fever to help the body fight infections. TNF can induce fever by triggering the release of cytokines interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, or through other mediators like PLA2. TNF or its mediators can reach the hypothalamus either through circulation in the bloodstream or through secretion by macrophages and endothelial cells near the hypothalamus. TNF can also induce fever by stimulating the primary vagal terminals in the liver, which signals to neurons to secrete norepinephrine. All of these pathways culminate in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which interact with the OVLT in the hypothalamus to raise the target temperature of the body.

=== Central nervous system ===
TNF is expressed in various cells in the central nervous system, including glial cells, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons, and plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis.

Through TNFR1 signalling, TNF can increase the surface expression of AMPA receptors and NDMA receptors in neurons, strengthening synaptic transmission. TNF also decreases the surface expression of GABAA receptors, reducing the activity of inhibitory synapses. TNF can also modulate the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, and S100B, a zinc-binding protein, by astrocytes. The modulation of excitation and inhibition of neurons by TNF indicates that TNF plays a role in synaptic scaling and plasticity.

Through TNFR2 signalling, TNF promotes the proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, which produce protective myelin sheaths around nerve cells. On the other hand, TNF becomes cytotoxic to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells when the cells are in contact with astrocytes.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Autoimmunity ===
Excessive production of TNF plays a key role in the pathology of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and noninfectious uveitis. In these diseases, TNF is erroneously secreted by immune cells in response to environmental factors or genetic mutations. TNF then triggers an inflammatory response, damaging normal tissue. TNF blockers, which prevent TNF from binding to its receptors, are often used to treat these diseases.

TNF induces inflammation both by activating inflammatory pathways, as well as by triggering cell death. Cell death triggers inflammation by exposing the components of dying cells to neighboring cells, as well as by compromising barrier integrity in the skin and intestine, allowing microbes to infiltrate the tissue. TNF is believed to trigger cell death in inflammatory diseases due to elevated levels of interfering cytokines, elevated levels of TNFR2 signalling, or genetic mutations. Drugs that target proteins involved in TNF-induced cell death, such as RIPK1, are being evaluated for their efficacy against autoinflammatory diseases.

=== Cancer ===
TNF was initially discovered as an agent that kills tumors, particularly sarcomas. However, TNF is now known to play a dual role in cancer, both as a promoter and inhibitor, due to its ability to induce either proliferation or death in tumor cells. The exact mechanisms determining which role TNF plays in cancer are unclear. In general, TNF is considered to be a cancer promoter.

In some cancers, TNF has been shown to play an inhibitory role, primarily when injected locally, repeatedly, and at high concentrations. Due to TNF&#x27;s adverse side effects, potential TNF cancer treatments seek to maximize cytotoxicity to tumors while minimizing exposure to the entire body. Some treatments increase cytotoxicity by inhibiting the cell survival pathways of tumors before treatment with TNF. Other treatments localize TNF activity using antibody-TNF fusions, also known as immunocytokines. Local TNF treatment has been shown to induce tumor regression, though they rarely induce complete remission. Body-wide administration of TNF has shown low efficacy and high side effects.

In many cancers, TNF is believed to play a supportive role. High TNF expression levels are associated with more advanced cancers, and TNF expression is found in tumor cells from the early stages of disease. TNF expression can lead to the recruitment of white blood cells that promote metastasis, as well as direct activation of pathways that promote tumor survival, invasion, and metastasis. TNF-blockers such as infliximab and etanercept did not induce a response in most advanced or metastatic cancers, but some studies have shown disease stabilization.

=== Infections ===
TNF plays a critical role in the innate immune response to infections. Accordingly, the use of TNF blockers is associated with increased risks of infection, such as with Varicella-zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and Cytomegalovirus.

Conversely, TNF plays a role in the progression of HIV by inducing apoptosis of T cells in HIV-infected people. TNF blockage has reportedly led to clinical improvement in HIV without worsening the infection, though data is limited.

=== Sepsis ===
TNF is believed to be an important contributor to sepsis due to its ability to upregulate the innate immune system and blood coagulation. In animals, the injection of TNF can produce heart, lung, kidney, and liver dysfunction similar to sepsis. However, in humans suffering from sepsis, TNF is not consistently elevated.

Although TNF blockers showed efficacy in treating sepsis in mice, they showed mixed results in treating sepsis in humans. This is believed to be due to the dual role that TNF plays in the immune system; blocking TNF reduces the severe inflammation that causes sepsis, but also hinders the immune system&#x27;s ability to resist the infection. It is hypothesized that TNF blockers are more beneficial in cases of severe sepsis, where the probability of death is higher.

=== Liver fibrosis ===
TNF is a key player in liver injury and inflammation, but its role in liver fibrosis is controversial. TNF contributes to the activation and survival of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), believed to be the primary contributors of liver fibrosis. On the other hand, TNF suppresses alpha-1 type-1 collagen expression and HSC proliferation &quot;in vitro&quot;, which should inhibit liver fibrosis. In general, TNF is considered to promote liver fibrosis by promoting HSC survival. Despite this connection, TNF blockers are not used to treat liver fibrosis. In clinical trials of alcoholic hepatitis, TNF blockers had no significant effect.

Additionally, hepatocyte death, the initial event that drives liver injury and fibrosis, may be induced by TNF, though this connection is uncertain. TNF injection alone does not induce hepatocyte death &quot;in vivo&quot;. However, when TNF injection is coupled with survival pathway inhibition, such as during hepatitis C virus infection, TNF induces hepatocyte death and acute liver failure. The remnants of dead hepatocytes are consumed by HSCs and Kupffer cells, which then secrete fibrosis-promoting factors, such as TGF-β, as well as promoting further hepatocyte death.

=== Insulin resistance ===
TNF promotes insulin resistance by inhibiting insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Under normal circumstances, IRS1, upon activation by insulin, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and increases glucose uptake in the cell. This process is disrupted when TNF induces the serine phosphorylation of IRS1, converting IRS1 into an insulin inhibitor. TNF-induced insulin resistance is common in cases of obesity and can lead to Type II Diabetes. TNF has been found to be upregulated in the adipose tissue of humans and animals with obesity, though it remains unclear why obesity induces high TNF levels.

=== Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ===
TNF plays a key role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in which fat builds up in the liver, leading to injury, inflammation, and scarring. TNF promotes insulin resistance, which promotes fat build up in the liver. As fat builds up in the liver and surrounding adipose tissue, immune cells may infiltrate the expanding tissue and secrete TNF, causing inflammation. Thus, TNF may serve as a causal link between inflammation, insulin resistance, and fat accumulation in the liver. Clinical studies have shown that TNF levels are correlated with the severity of NAFLD, although some studies have shown otherwise. Pharmacological strategies that downregulate TNF have shown favorable effects on NAFLD, while the efficacy of TNF blockers is yet to be evaluated.

=== Muscle wasting ===
Conditions that cause inflammation, such as cancer, can elevate TNF levels, which contributes to muscle wasting. TNF contributes to muscle wasting by activating the NF-κB pathway, which activates the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway to degrade protein, and by inhibiting the activation of satellite cells, which are responsible for protein regeneration. However, TNF blockers have had limited effect on muscle wasting in clinical studies, likely due to the multifactorial nature of muscle wasting.

=== Exercise ===
During exercise, the level of IL-6, a TNF inhibitor, rapidly increases, leading to an anti-inflammatory effect. This is followed by a subsequent increase in the levels of IL-10 and soluble TNF receptors, both of which also inhibit TNF. While moderate exercise does not increase TNF levels, strenuous exercise has been shown to increase TNF levels two-fold, causing a pro-inflammatory effect. However, this proinflammatory effect is outweighed by the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-6, which can increase 50-fold. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce base TNF levels in the long term. Thus, exercise is generally considered to inhibit TNF, which contributes to the overall anti-inflammatory effect of exercise.

=== Neuroinflammation ===
In the central nervous system, TNF is primarily produced by microglia, a type of macrophage, but also by neurons, endothelial cells, and immune cells. Excessive TNF contributes to neuroinflammation by causing excitotoxic neuronal cell death, increasing glutamate levels, activating microglial cells, and disrupting the blood–brain barrier. As a result, TNF is seen to play an important role in central nervous system disorders associated with neuroinflammation, including neurosarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, Neuro-Behçet&#x27;s disease.

Paradoxically, TNF-blockers can cause demyelination of neurons and worsen multiple sclerosis symptoms. This is believed to be due to the homeostatic role of TNF in the central nervous system, especially on neuron myelination via TNFR2. The selective blockade of TNFR1 has shown positive outcomes in animal models.

TNF-induced neuroinflammation has also been associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and is suspected to contribute to the amyloid-β plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation found in the brains of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients. TNF blockers have been associated with reduced risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s. Some studies have shown TNF blockers to slightly improve cognition in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients, though larger studies are needed. Since TNF blockers cannot pass through the blood–brain barrier, it is believed that reducing TNF levels across the body also reduces TNF levels within the brain.

=== TRAPS ===
In TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), genetic mutations in TNFR1 lead to defective binding of TNFR1 to TNF, as well as defective shedding of TNFR1, a mechanism that attenuates TNFR1 signalling. This causes periodic inflammation, though the exact mechanism is unknown. TNF blockers such as etanercept have shown partial efficacy in reducing symptoms, while other TNF blockers such as adalimumab and infliximab have been shown to worsen symptoms.

=== Taste perception ===
Excessive levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as during infection or autoimmunity, have been associated with anorexia and reduced food intake. It is hypothesized that TNF reduces food intake by increasing sensitivity to bitter taste, though the exact mechanisms of this are unknown.

== Pharmacology ==
=== TNF blockers ===

TNF blockers bind to TNF to prevent it from activating its receptors. Additionally, TNF blockers that bind to tmTNF may induce apoptosis in TNF-expressing cells, eliminating inflammatory immune cells. TNF blockers can be monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, while others are decoy fusion proteins, like etanercept. New TNF blockers are being developed, including small compounds that can specifically target TNF and monoclonal antibodies with lower immunogenicity potential. Rarely, the suppression of TNF can lead to the development of a new form of &quot;paradoxical&quot; autoimmunity, caused by the overexpression of other cytokines.

<text>A reef is a ridge or shoal of rock, coral, or similar relatively stable material lying beneath the surface of a natural body of water. Many reefs result from natural, abiotic (non-living) processes such as deposition of sand or wave erosion planning down rock outcrops. However, reefs such as the coral reefs of tropical waters are formed by biotic (living) processes, dominated by corals and coralline algae. Artificial reefs, such as shipwrecks and other man-made underwater structures, may occur intentionally or as the result of an accident. These are sometimes designed to increase the physical complexity of featureless sand bottoms to attract a more diverse range of organisms. They provide shelter to various aquatic animals which help prevent extinction. Another reason reefs are put in place is for aquaculture, and fish farmers who are looking to improve their businesses sometimes invest in them. Reefs are often quite near to the surface, but not all definitions require this.

Earth&#x27;s largest coral reef system is the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, at a length of over .

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;reef&quot; traces its origins back to the Old Norse word &quot;rif,&quot; meaning &quot;rib&quot; or &quot;reef&quot;. &quot;Rif&quot; comes from the Proto-Germanic term &quot;ribją&quot; meaning &quot;rib&quot;.

==Classification==
Reefs may be classified in terms of their origin, geographical location, depth, and topography. For example a tropical coral fringing reef, or a temperate rocky intertidal reef.

=== Biotic ===
A variety of biotic reef types exists, including oyster reefs and sponge reefs, but the most massive and widely distributed are tropical coral reefs. Although corals are major contributors to the framework and bulk material comprising a coral reef, the organisms most responsible for reef growth against the constant assault from ocean waves are calcareous algae, especially, although not entirely, coralline algae.

Oyster larvae prefer to settle on adult oysters and thereby develop layers building upwards. These eventually form a fairly massive hard stony calcium carbonate structure on which other reef organisms like sponges and seaweeds can grow, and provide a habitat for mobile benthic organisms.

These biotic reef types take on additional names depending upon how the reef lies in relation to the land, if any. Reef types include fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. A fringing reef is a reef that is attached to an island. Whereas, a barrier reef forms a calcareous barrier around an island, resulting in a lagoon between the shore and the reef. Conversely, an atoll is a ring reef with no land present.

The reef front, facing the ocean, is a high energy locale. Whereas, the internal lagoon will be at a lower energy with fine grained sediments.

==== Mounds ====
Both mounds and reefs are considered to be varieties of organosedimentary buildups, which are sedimentary features, built by the interaction of organisms and their environment. These interactions have a synoptic relief and whose biotic composition differs from that found on and beneath the surrounding sea floor. However, reefs are held up by a macroscopic skeletal framework, as what is seen on coral reefs. Corals and calcareous algae grow on top of one another, forming a three-dimensional framework that is modified in various ways by other organisms and inorganic processes.

Conversely, mounds lack a macroscopic skeletal framework. Instead, they are built by microorganisms or by organisms that also lack a skeletal framework. A microbial mound might be built exclusively or primarily by cyanobacteria. Examples of biostromes formed by cyanobacteria occur in the Great Salt Lake in Utah, United States, and in Shark Bay on the coast of Western Australia.

Cyanobacteria do not have skeletons, and individual organisms are microscopic. However, they can encourage the precipitation or accumulation of calcium carbonate to produce distinct sediment bodies in composition that have relief on the seafloor. Cyanobacterial mounds were most abundant before the evolution of shelly macroscopic organisms, but they still exist today. Stromatolites, for instance, are microbial mounds with a laminated internal structure. Whereas, bryozoans and crinoids, common contributors to marine sediments during the Mississippian period, produce a different kind of mound. Although bryozoans are small and crinoid skeletons disintegrate, bryozoan and crinoid meadows can persist over time and produce compositionally distinct bodies of sediment with depositional relief.

The Proterozoic Belt Supergroup contains evidence of possible microbial mat and dome structures similar to stromatolite and chicken reef complexes.

=== Geologic ===

Rocky reefs are underwater outcrops of rock projecting above the adjacent unconsolidated surface with varying relief. They can be found in depth ranges from intertidal to deep water and provide a substrate for a large range of sessile benthic organisms, and shelter for a large range of mobile organisms. They are often located in sub-tropical, temperate, and sub-polar latitudes.
==== Structures ====
Ancient reefs buried within stratigraphic sections are of considerable interest to geologists because they provide paleo-environmental information about the location in Earth&#x27;s history. In addition, reef structures within a sequence of sedimentary rocks provide a discontinuity which may serve as a trap or conduit for fossil fuels or mineralizing fluids to form petroleum or ore deposits.

Corals, including some major extinct groups Rugosa and Tabulata, have been important reef builders through much of the Phanerozoic since the Ordovician Period. However, other organism groups, such as calcifying algae, especially members of the red algae (Rhodophyta), and molluscs (especially the rudist bivalves during the Cretaceous Period) have created massive structures at various times.

During the Cambrian Period, the conical or tubular skeletons of Archaeocyatha, an extinct group of uncertain affinities (possibly sponges), built reefs. Other groups, such as the Bryozoa, have been important interstitial organisms, living between the framework builders. The corals which build reefs today, the Scleractinia, arose after the Permian–Triassic extinction event that wiped out the earlier rugose corals (as well as many other groups). They became increasingly important reef builders throughout the Mesozoic Era. They may have arisen from a rugose coral ancestor.

Rugose corals built their skeletons of calcite and have a different symmetry from that of the scleractinian corals, whose skeletons are aragonite. However, there are some unusual examples of well-preserved aragonitic rugose corals in the Late Permian. In addition, calcite has been reported in the initial post-larval calcification in a few scleractinian corals. Nevertheless, scleractinian corals (which arose in the middle Triassic) may have arisen from a non-calcifying ancestor independent of the rugosan corals (which disappeared in the late Permian).

=== Artificial ===

An artificial reef is a human-created underwater structure, typically built to promote marine life in areas with a generally featureless bottom, to control erosion, block ship passage, block the use of trawling nets, or improve surfing.

Many reefs are built using objects that were built for other purposes, for example by sinking oil rigs (through the Rigs-to-Reefs program), scuttling ships, or by deploying rubble or construction debris. Other artificial reefs are purpose built (e.g. the reef balls) from PVC or concrete. Shipwrecks become artificial reefs on the seafloor. Regardless of construction method, artificial reefs generally provide stable hard surfaces where algae and invertebrates such as barnacles, corals, and oysters attach; the accumulation of attached marine life in turn provides intricate structure and food for assemblages of fish.

<text>, sometimes transliterated as Gumpei Yokoi, was a Japanese toy maker and video game designer. As a long-time Nintendo employee, he was best known as creator of the Game &amp; Watch handheld system, inventor of the cross-shaped Control Pad, the original designer of the Game Boy, and producer of a few long-running and critically acclaimed video game franchises such as &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;.

==Career==

Yokoi graduated from Doshisha University with a degree in electronics. He was first hired by Nintendo in 1965 to maintain the assembly-line machines used to manufacture its &quot;hanafuda&quot; cards.

In 1966, Hiroshi Yamauchi, president of Nintendo, came to a &quot;hanafuda&quot; factory where Yokoi was working and took notice of a toy, an extending arm that Yokoi made for his own amusement during spare time while doing maintenance. Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush. The Ultra Hand was a huge success, and Yokoi was asked to work on other Nintendo toys, including the Ten Billion Barrel puzzle, a miniature remote-controlled vacuum cleaner called the Chiritory, a baseball-throwing machine called the Ultra Machine, and a &quot;Love Tester&quot;. He worked on toys until the company decided to make video games in 1974, when he became one of its first game designers, only preceded by Genyo Takeda. While traveling on the Shinkansen, Yokoi supposedly saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator by pressing the buttons. Yokoi then got the idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature video gaming pastime.

In 1981, Yamauchi appointed Yokoi to supervise &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, an arcade game created by Shigeru Miyamoto. Yokoi explained many of the intricacies of game design to Miyamoto at the beginning of his career, and the project only came to be approved after Yokoi brought Miyamoto&#x27;s game ideas to the president&#x27;s attention.

After the worldwide success of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Yokoi continued to work with Miyamoto on the next &quot;Mario&quot; game, &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; He proposed the multiplayer concept and convinced his co-worker to give Mario some superhuman abilities, such as the ability to jump unharmed from great heights.


After &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, Yokoi produced several R&amp;D1 games, such as &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; and &quot;Metroid&quot;. He designed R.O.B. and the Game Boy, the latter of which became a worldwide success. Another of his creations, the Virtual Boy, was a commercial failure. Nintendo has denied that the Virtual Boy&#x27;s poor performance in the market was the reason for Yokoi&#x27;s subsequent departure from the company, holding that his retirement was &quot;absolutely coincidental&quot; to the market performance of any Nintendo hardware. According to his Nintendo and Koto colleague Yoshihiro Taki, Yokoi had originally decided to retire at age 50 to do as he pleased but had simply delayed it. According to David Sheff&#x27;s book &quot;Game Over&quot;, Yokoi never actually intended for the console to be released in its present form. However, Nintendo pushed the Virtual Boy to market so that it could focus development resources on the Nintendo 64.

Amid the failure of the Virtual Boy and the launch of the more successful Game Boy Pocket, Yokoi left Nintendo on 15 August 1996, after thirty-one years at the company. Leaving with several of his subordinates to form a new company called Koto, Yokoi led the development of the Bandai WonderSwan handheld game console.

==Design philosophy==

Yokoi said &quot;The Nintendo way of adapting technology is not to look for the state of the art but to utilize mature technology that can be mass-produced cheaply.&quot; He articulated his philosophy of (also translated as &quot;Lateral Thinking with Seasoned Technology&quot;), in the book &quot;Yokoi Gunpei Game House&quot;. &quot;Withered technology&quot; in this context refers to a mature technology which is cheap and well understood. &quot;Lateral thinking&quot; refers to finding radical new ways of using such technology. Yokoi held that toys and games do not necessarily require cutting-edge technology; novel and fun gameplay are more important. In the interview, he suggested that expensive cutting-edge technology can get in the way of developing a new product.

Game &amp; Watch was developed based on this philosophy. At the time of its development, Sharp and Casio were fiercely competing in the digital calculator market. For this reason, there was a glut of liquid crystal displays and semiconductors. The &quot;lateral thinking&quot; was to find an original and fun use for this cheap and abundant technology. The NES and Game Boy were developed under a similar philosophy. In the handheld market, Yokoi&#x27;s refusal to adopt a color display for the Game Boy, in favor of long battery life, is cited as the main reason it prevailed against Sega&#x27;s Game Gear and Atari&#x27;s Lynx.

Satoru Iwata, CEO of Nintendo from 2002 until his death in 2015, claimed that this philosophy has been passed on to the disciples of Yokoi, such as Miyamoto, and it continues to show itself in Nintendo&#x27;s then current use of technology, with the highly successful Nintendo DS and Wii.

The Wii&#x27;s internal technology was similar to that of Nintendo&#x27;s previous home console, the GameCube, and was not as advanced in terms of computational capability and multimedia versatility compared to its competitors: the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Instead, the system offered something completely different by introducing motion-based controls to the console market in an attempt to change the ways video games are played, and consequently, to widen the audience for video games in general. This strategy demonstrated Nintendo&#x27;s belief that graphical advancement isn&#x27;t the only way to make progress in gaming technology; indeed, after the Wii&#x27;s overwhelming success, Sony and Microsoft released their own motion control peripherals. Nintendo&#x27;s emphasis on peripherals for the Wii has also been pointed to as an example of Yokoi&#x27;s &quot;lateral thinking&quot; at work.

==Death==

On 4 October 1997, Yokoi was riding in a car driven by his associate Etsuo Kiso on the Hokuriku Expressway, when the vehicle rear-ended a truck. After the two men had left the car to inspect the damage, Yokoi was hit and injured by a passing car. The driver of the car that hit Yokoi in the second accident was Gen Tsushima, a member of the tourism industry. Yokoi&#x27;s death was confirmed two hours later. Kiso suffered only a fractured rib.

==Legacy==

The title of his main biography from 2010 translates from Japanese as &quot;Father of Games – Gunpei Yokoi, the Man Who Created Nintendo&#x27;s DNA&quot;. A 1997 book&#x27;s title translates to &quot;Yokoi&#x27;s House of Gaming&quot;, which was explored in English in 2010 by Tokyo Scum Brigade. A 2014 book about him is &quot;Gunpei Yokoi: The Life &amp; Philosophy of Nintendo&#x27;s God of Toys&quot;.

In 2003, Yokoi posthumously received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the International Game Developers Association. GameTrailers placed him on their lists for the &quot;Top Ten Game Creators&quot;. An art gallery in Japan created an art exhibit in 2010 titled &quot;The Man Who Was Called the God of Games&quot; featuring all his key Nintendo works. In 1999, Bandai began releasing a series of handheld puzzle games named &quot;Gunpey&quot; as a tribute to their original creator, Yokoi.

<text>Hermann Joseph Muller (December 21, 1890 – April 5, 1967) was an American geneticist who was awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, &quot;for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X-rays&quot;. Muller warned of long-term dangers of radioactive fallout from nuclear war and nuclear testing, which resulted in greater public scrutiny of these practices.

==Early life==
Muller was born in New York City, the son of Frances (Lyons) and Hermann Joseph Muller Sr., an artisan who worked with metals. Muller was a third-generation American whose father&#x27;s ancestors were originally Catholic and came to the United States from Koblenz. His mother&#x27;s family was of mixed Jewish (descended from Spanish and Portuguese Jews) and Anglican background, and had come from Britain. Among his first cousins was Alfred Kroeber (Kroeber was Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s father) and first cousins once removed was Herbert J. Muller. As an adolescent, Muller attended a Unitarian church and considered himself a pantheist; in high school, he became an atheist. He excelled in the public schools. At 16, he entered Columbia College. From his first semester, he was interested in biology; he became an early convert of the Mendelian-chromosome theory of heredity—and the concept of genetic mutations and natural selection as the basis for evolution. He formed a biology club and also became a proponent of eugenics; the connections between biology and society would be his perennial concern. Muller earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1910.

Muller remained at Columbia (the pre-eminent American zoology program at the time, due to E. B. Wilson and his students) for graduate school. He became interested in the &quot;Drosophila&quot; genetics work of Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s fly lab after undergraduate bottle washers Alfred Sturtevant and Calvin Bridges joined his biology club. In 1911–1912, he studied metabolism at Cornell University, but remained involved with Columbia. He followed the drosophilists as the first genetic maps emerged from Morgan&#x27;s experiments, and joined Morgan&#x27;s group in 1912 (after two years of informal participation).

In the fly group, Muller&#x27;s contributions were primarily theoretical—explanations for experimental results and ideas and predictions for new experiments. In the emerging collaborative culture of the drosophilists, however, credit was assigned based on results rather than ideas; Muller felt cheated when he was left out of major publications.

==Career==
In 1914, Julian Huxley offered Muller a position at the recently founded William Marsh Rice Institute, now Rice University; he hurried to complete his Doctor of philosophy degree and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915–1916 academic year (his degree was issued in 1916). At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued &quot;Drosophila&quot; lab work. In 1918, he proposed an explanation for the dramatic discontinuous alterations in &quot;Oenothera lamarckiana&quot; that were the basis of Hugo de Vries&#x27;s
theory of mutationism: &quot;balanced lethals&quot; allowed the accumulation of recessive mutations, and rare crossing over events resulted in the sudden expression of these hidden traits. In other words, de Vries&#x27;s experiments were explainable by the Mendelian-chromosome theory. Muller&#x27;s work was increasingly focused on mutation rate and lethal mutations. In 1918, Morgan, short-handed because many of his students and assistants were drafted for the U.S. entry into World War I, convinced Muller to return to Columbia to teach and to expand his experimental program.

At Columbia, Muller and his collaborator and longtime friend Edgar Altenburg continued the investigation of lethal mutations. The primary method for detecting such mutations was to measure the sex ratios of the offspring of female flies. They predicted the ratio would vary from 1:1 due to recessive mutations on the X chromosome, which would be expressed only in males (which lacked the functional allele on a second X chromosome). Muller found a strong temperature dependence in mutation rate, leading him to believe that spontaneous mutation was the dominant mode (and to initially discount the role of external factors such as ionizing radiation or chemical agents). In 1920, Muller and Altenburg coauthored a seminal paper in &quot;Genetics&quot; on &quot;modifier genes&quot; that determine the size of mutant &quot;Drosophila&quot; wings. In 1919, Muller made the important discovery of a mutant (later found to be a chromosomal inversion) that appeared to suppress crossing over, which opened up new avenues in mutation-rate studies. However, his appointment at Columbia was not continued; he accepted an offer from the University of Texas and left Columbia after the summer of 1920.

Muller taught at the University of Texas from 1920 until 1932. Soon after returning to Texas, he married mathematics professor Jessie Marie Jacobs, whom he had courted previously. In his early years at Texas, Muller&#x27;s &quot;Drosophila&quot; work was slow going; the data from his mutation rate studies were difficult to interpret. In 1923, he began using radium and X-rays, but the relationship between radiation and mutation was difficult to measure because such radiation also sterilized the flies. In this period, he also became involved with eugenics and human genetics. He carried out a study of twins separated at birth that seemed to indicate a strong hereditary component of I.Q. Muller was critical of the new directions of the eugenics movement (such as anti-immigration), but was hopeful about the prospects for positive eugenics. In 1932, at the Third International Eugenics Congress, Muller gave a speech and stated, &quot;eugenics might yet perfect the human race, but only in a society consciously organized for the common good&quot;.

===Discovery of X-ray mutagenesis===
In 1926, a series of major breakthroughs began. In November, Muller carried out two experiments with varied doses of X-rays, the second of which used the crossing over suppressor stock (&quot;ClB&quot;) he had found in 1919. A clear, quantitative connection between radiation and lethal mutations quickly emerged. Muller&#x27;s discovery created a media sensation after he delivered a paper entitled &quot;The Problem of Genetic Modification&quot; at the Fifth International Congress of Genetics in Berlin; it would make him one of the better-known public intellectuals of the early 20th century. By 1928, others had replicated his dramatic results, expanding them to other model organisms, such as wasps and maize. In the following years, he began publicizing the likely dangers of radiation exposure in humans (such as physicians who frequently operate X-ray equipment or shoe sellers who radiated their customers&#x27; feet).

His lab grew quickly, but it shrank again following the onset of the Great Depression. Especially after the stock market crash, Muller was increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of capitalism. Some of his visiting lab members were from the USSR, and he helped edit and distribute an illegal leftist student newspaper, &quot;The Spark&quot;. It was a difficult period for Muller both scientifically and personally; his marriage was falling apart, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with his life in Texas. Meanwhile, the waning of the eugenics movement, ironically hastened by his own work pointing to the previously ignored connections between environment and genetics, meant that his ideas on the future of human evolution had reduced impact in the public sphere. Muller&#x27;s speech before the Third International Eugenics Conference in New York has been credited with marking the end of Galtonism, and perhaps even eugenics itself, as a popular movement in the sciences. H. Bentley Glass, a contemporary observer and Ph.D. student of Muller&#x27;s, would say Muller&#x27;s speech &quot;just about finished the activity of the Eugenics Society&quot;. Muller told the assembled that eugenic ideals could no longer be achieved, because the capitalistic system produces the wrong motives of individual action, and he disdained the natures of the dominant class, and the type of society they were creating.

===Work in Europe===
In September 1932, Muller moved to Berlin to work with the Russian expatriate geneticist Nikolay Timofeeff-Ressovsky; a trip intended as a limited sabbatical stretched into an eight-year, five-country journey. In Berlin, he met two physicists who would later be significant to the biology community: Niels Bohr and Max Delbrück. The Nazi movement was precipitating the rapid emigration of scientific talent from Germany, and Muller was particularly opposed to the politics of National Socialism. The FBI was investigating Muller because of his involvement with &quot;The Spark&quot;, so he chose instead to go to the Soviet Union (an environment better suited to his political beliefs). In 1933, Muller and his wife reconciled, and their son David E. Muller and she moved with Hermann to Leningrad. There, at the Institute of Genetics, he imported the basic equipment for a &quot;Drosophila&quot; lab—including the flies—and set up shop. The institute was moved to Moscow in 1934, and Muller and his wife were divorced in 1935.

In the USSR, Muller supervised a large and productive lab, and organized work on medical genetics. Most of his work involved further explorations of genetics and radiation. There he completed his eugenics book, &quot;Out of the Night&quot;, the main ideas of which dated to 1910. By 1936, however, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s repressive policies and the rise of Lysenkoism was making the USSR an increasingly problematic place to live and work. Muller and many of the Russian genetics community did what they could to oppose Trofim Lysenko and his Larmarckian evolutionary theory, but Muller was soon forced to leave the Soviet Union after Stalin read a translation of his eugenics book and was &quot;displeased by it, and...ordered an attack prepared against it.&quot; By this time, Muller had already asked for a leave of absence. News of the Lysenko trials had reached the United States, and his son David was being raised there, after his divorce. In the official declaration by the Institute, biological determinism was rejected: &quot;The development of society is subject not to biological laws but to higher social laws. Attempts to spread to humanity the laws of the animal kingdom are an attempt to lower the human being to the level of beasts.&quot;

Muller, with about 250 strains of &quot;Drosophila&quot;, moved to University of Edinburgh in September 1937, after brief stays in Madrid and Paris. In 1938, with war on the horizon, he began looking for a permanent position back in the United States. He also began courting Dorothea &quot;Thea&quot; Kantorowicz, a German refugee; they were married in May 1939. The Seventh International Congress on Genetics was held in Edinburgh later that year; Muller wrote a &quot;Geneticists&#x27; Manifesto&quot; in response to the question: &quot;How could the world&#x27;s population be improved most effectively genetically?&quot; He also engaged in a debate with the perennial genetics gadfly Richard Goldschmidt over the existence of the gene, for which little direct physical evidence existed at the time.

===Later career===
When Muller returned to the United States in 1940, he took an untenured research position at Amherst College, in the department of Otto C. Glaser. After the U.S. entry into World War II, his position was extended indefinitely and expanded to include teaching. His &quot;Drosophila&quot; work in this period focused on measuring the rate of spontaneous (as opposed to radiation-induced) mutations. Muller&#x27;s publication rate decreased greatly in this period, from a combination of lack of lab workers and experimentally challenging projects. However, he also worked as an adviser in the Manhattan Project (though he did not know that was what it was), as well as a study of the mutational effects of radar. Muller&#x27;s appointment was ended after the 1944–1945 academic year, and despite difficulties stemming from his socialist political activities, he found a position as professor of zoology at Indiana University. Here, he lived in a Dutch Colonial Revival house in Bloomington&#x27;s Vinegar Hill neighborhood.

In 1946, Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, &quot;for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X-rays&quot;. Genetics, and especially the physical and physiological nature of the gene, was becoming a central topic in biology, and X-ray mutagenesis was a key to many recent advances, among them George Beadle and Edward Tatum&#x27;s work on &quot;Neurospora&quot; that established in 1941 the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis. In Muller&#x27;s Nobel Prize lecture, he argued that no threshold dose of radiation existed that did not produce mutagenesis, which led to the adoption of the linear no-threshold model of radiation on cancer risks.

The Nobel Prize, in the wake of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, focused public attention on a subject Muller had been publicizing for two decades - the dangers of radiation. In 1952, nuclear fallout became a public issue; since Operation Crossroads, more and more evidence had been leaking out about radiation sickness and death caused by nuclear testing. Muller and many other scientists pursued an array of political activities to defuse the threat of nuclear war. With the Castle Bravo fallout controversy in 1954, the issue became even more urgent. In 1955, Muller was one of 11 prominent intellectuals to sign the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, the upshot of which was the first 1957 Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs, which addressed the control of nuclear weapons. He was a signatory (with many other scientists) of the 1958 petition to the United Nations, calling for an end to nuclear weapons testing, which was initiated by the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling.

Muller&#x27;s opinions on the effect of radiation on mutagenesis were used by Rachel Carson in her book &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, however, his opinions have been criticized by some scientists; geneticist James F. Crow called Muller&#x27;s view &quot;alarmist&quot; and wrote that it created in the public &quot;an irrational fear of low-level radiation relative to other risks&quot;. It has been argued that Muller&#x27;s opinion was not supported by studies on the survivors of the atomic bombings, or by research on mice, and that he ignored another study that contradicted the linear no-threshold model he supported, thereby affecting the formulation of policy that favored this model. He was also accused of suppressing opposing views, and that the US National Academy of Sciences Committee of which he was part of misrepresented research record to ensure continued funding and strengthen his influence on US health policy.

Muller was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1942 and the American Philosophical Society in 1947 Muller was awarded the Linnean Society of London&#x27;s Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958 and the Kimber Genetics Award of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, of which he was a member, in 1955. He served as president of the American Humanist Association from 1956 to 1958. The American Mathematical Society selected him as its Gibbs Lecturer for 1958. He retired in 1964. The &quot;Drosophila&quot; basic units of inheritance, their chromosomal arms, are named &quot;Muller elements&quot; in Muller&#x27;s honor. he died in 1967.

H. J. Muller and science fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin were first cousins once removed; his father (Hermann J. Muller Sr.) and her father&#x27;s mother (Johanna Muller Kroeber) were siblings, the children of Nicholas Müller, who immigrated to the United States in 1848, and at that time dropped the umlaut from his name. Another cousin was Herbert J. Muller, whose grandfather Otto was another son of Nicholas and a sibling of Hermann Sr. and Johanna.

===Legacy===
In a recent retrospective article about Muller&#x27;s contribution, James Haber wrote as follows:

 Drosophila geneticist, Hermann Muller, envisioned the fundamental principles that such a molecule must have: to be auto-assembling and to be mutable but then again stable. He followed his prescient review of these properties with a remarkable prediction: learning about the hereditary material and its properties would not come from studying Drosophila, but from studying bacteria and their bacteriophages.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Personal life==

Muller had a daughter, Helen J. Muller, now a professor emerita at the University of New Mexico, who has a daughter, Mala Htun, also a professor at the University of New Mexico. His son, David E. Muller, professor emeritus of mathematics and computer science at the University of Illinois and at New Mexico State University, died in 2008 in Las Cruces, New Mexico. David&#x27;s mother was Jessie Jacobs Muller Offermann (1890–1954), Hermann&#x27;s first wife. Helen&#x27;s mother was Dorothea Kantorowicz Muller (1909–1986), Hermann&#x27;s second wife, who came to the U.S. in 1940 as a German Jewish refugee. He had a brief affair with Milly Bennett.

<text>An islet ( ) is generally a small island. Definitions vary, and are not precise, but some suggest that an islet is a very small, often unnamed, island with little or no vegetation to support human habitation. It may be made of rock, sand and/or hard coral; may be permanent or tidal (i.e. surfaced reef or seamount); and may exist in the sea, lakes, rivers or any other sizeable bodies of water.

== Definition ==
As suggested by its origin &quot;islette&quot;, an Old French diminutive of &quot;isle&quot;, use of the term implies small size, but little attention is given to drawing an upper limit on its applicability.

The World Landforms website says, &quot;An islet landform is generally considered to be a rock or small island that has little vegetation and cannot sustain human habitation&quot;, and further that size may vary from a few square feet to several square miles, with no specific rule pertaining to size.

==Other terms==
* Ait (/eɪt/, like eight) or eyot (/aɪ(ə)t, eɪt/), a small island. It is especially used to refer to river islands found on the River Thames and its tributaries in England.
* Cay or key, an islet formed by the accumulation of fine sand deposits atop a reef, especially in the Caribbean and West Atlantic. Rum Cay in the Bahamas and the Florida Keys off Florida are examples of islets.
* The French suffix &quot;-hou&quot; from the Scandinavian &quot;-holm&quot;, is used for the names of some islets in the Channel Islands, such as Écréhous, Burhou, Lihou and Les Houmets, and off Normandy, such as Tatihou.
* Inch, a term used especially in Scotland, from the Gaelic &quot;innis&quot;, which originally meant island, but has been supplanted to refer to smaller islands, such the islet of Inch, off St Mary&#x27;s Isle Priory, Inch Kenneth, Inchkeith, Keith Inch (no longer an island) and Inchcailloch.
* Motu, a reef islet formed by broken coral and sand, surrounding an atoll, especially in Polynesia, such as Motu One, Motu Nao and Motu Paahi.
* River island, an islet within the current of a river, such as the Île de la Cité in Paris.
* , in the sense of a type of islet, is an uninhabited landform composed of exposed rocks, lying offshore, and having at most minimal vegetation, such as Albino Rock in the Palm Island group off Queensland, Australia. 
* Sandbar or shoal, an exposed sandbar.
* Sea stack, a thin, vertical landform jutting out of a body of water.
* Skerry, a small rocky island, usually defined to be too small for habitation, especially in Ireland.
* Subsidiary islets, a more technical application, is applied to small land features isolated by water, lying off the shore of a larger island. Similarly, any emergent land in an atoll is also called an islet.
* Tidal island, small islands (not always islets) which lie closely off the coast of a mainland or a much larger island, being connected to it (and thus becomes a peninsula/promontory) in low tide and isolated by a channel in high tide.

== In international law ==

Whether an islet is considered a rock or not, it can have significant economic consequences under Article 121 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which stipulates that &quot;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&quot; One long-term dispute over the status of such an islet was that of Snake Island (Black Sea).

The International Court of Justice jurisprudence however sometimes ignores islets, regardless of inhabitation status, in deciding territorial disputes; it did so in 2009 in adjudicating the Romania-Ukraine dispute, and previously in the dispute between Libya and Malta involving the islet of Filfla.

<text>Gene silencing is the regulation of gene expression in a cell to prevent the expression of a certain gene. Gene silencing can occur during either transcription or translation and is often used in research. In particular, methods used to silence genes are being increasingly used to produce therapeutics to combat cancer and other diseases, such as infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.

Gene silencing is often considered the same as gene knockdown. When genes are silenced, their expression is reduced. In contrast, when genes are knocked out, they are completely erased from the organism&#x27;s genome and, thus, have no expression. Gene silencing is considered a gene knockdown mechanism since the methods used to silence genes, such as RNAi, CRISPR, or siRNA, generally reduce the expression of a gene by at least 70% but do not eliminate it. Methods using gene silencing are often considered better than gene knockouts since they allow researchers to study essential genes that are required for the animal models to survive and cannot be removed. In addition, they provide a more complete view on the development of diseases since diseases are generally associated with genes that have a reduced expression.

== Research methods ==

===Antisense oligonucleotides===

Antisense oligonucleotides were discovered in 1978 by Paul Zamecnik and Mary Stephenson. Oligonucleotides, which are short nucleic acid fragments, bind to complementary target mRNA molecules when added to the cell. These molecules can be composed of single-stranded DNA or RNA and are generally 13–25 nucleotides long. The antisense oligonucleotides can affect gene expression in two ways: by using an RNase H-dependent mechanism or by using a steric blocking mechanism. RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides cause the target mRNA molecules to be degraded, while steric-blocker oligonucleotides prevent translation of the mRNA molecule. The majority of antisense drugs function through the RNase H-dependent mechanism, in which RNase H hydrolyzes the RNA strand of the DNA/RNA heteroduplex. expression.

===Ribozymes===
Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules used to inhibit gene expression. These molecules work by cleaving mRNA molecules, essentially silencing the genes that produced them. Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech first discovered catalytic RNA molecules, RNase P and group II intron ribozymes, in 1989 and won the Nobel Prize for their discovery. Several types of ribozyme motifs exist, including hammerhead, hairpin, hepatitis delta virus, group I, group II, and RNase P ribozymes. Hammerhead, hairpin, and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme motifs are generally found in viruses or viroid RNAs. These motifs are able to self-cleave a specific phosphodiester bond on an mRNA molecule. Lower eukaryotes and a few bacteria contain group I and group II ribozymes. These motifs can self-splice by cleaving and joining phosphodiester bonds. The last ribozyme motif, the RNase P ribozyme, is found in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and is known for its ability to cleave the phosphodiester bonds of several tRNA precursors when joined to a protein cofactor.

The general catalytic mechanism used by ribozymes is similar to the mechanism used by protein ribonucleases. These catalytic RNA molecules bind to a specific site and attack the neighboring phosphate in the RNA backbone with their 2&#x27; oxygen, which acts as a nucleophile, resulting in the formation of cleaved products with a 2&#x27;3&#x27;-cyclic phosphate and a 5&#x27; hydroxyl terminal end. This catalytic mechanism has been increasingly used by scientists to perform sequence-specific cleavage of target mRNA molecules. In addition, attempts are being made to use ribozymes to produce gene silencing therapeutics, which would silence genes that are responsible for causing diseases.

===RNA interference===

RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural process used by cells to regulate gene expression. It was discovered in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, who won the Nobel Prize for their discovery in 2006. The process to silence genes first begins with the entrance of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule into the cell, which triggers the RNAi pathway. The double-stranded molecule is then cut into small double-stranded fragments by an enzyme called Dicer. These small fragments, which include small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), are approximately 21–23 nucleotides in length. The fragments integrate into a multi-subunit protein called the RNA-induced silencing complex, which contains Argonaute proteins that are essential components of the RNAi pathway. One strand of the molecule, called the &quot;guide&quot; strand, binds to RISC, while the other strand, known as the &quot;passenger&quot; strand is degraded. The guide or antisense strand of the fragment that remains bound to RISC directs the sequence-specific silencing of the target mRNA molecule. The genes can be silenced by siRNA molecules that cause the endonucleatic cleavage of the target mRNA molecules or by miRNA molecules that suppress translation of the mRNA molecule. With the cleavage or translational repression of the mRNA molecules, the genes that form them are rendered essentially inactive. RNAi is thought to have evolved as a cellular defense mechanism against invaders, such as RNA viruses, or to combat the proliferation of transposons within a cell&#x27;s DNA. Both RNA viruses and transposons can exist as double-stranded RNA and lead to the activation of RNAi. Currently, siRNAs are being widely used to suppress specific gene expression and to assess the function of genes. Companies utilizing this approach include Alnylam, Sanofi, Arrowhead, Discerna, and Persomics, among others.

===Three prime untranslated regions and microRNAs===
The three prime untranslated regions (3&#x27;UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause gene silencing. Such 3&#x27;-UTRs often contain both binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3&#x27;-UTR, a large number of specific miRNAs decrease gene expression of their particular target mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript, using a mechanism similar to RNA interference (see MicroRNA). The 3&#x27;-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of an mRNA.

The 3&#x27;-UTR often contains microRNA response elements (MREs). MREs are sequences to which miRNAs bind and cause gene silencing. These are prevalent motifs within 3&#x27;-UTRs. Among all regulatory motifs within the 3&#x27;-UTRs (e.g. including silencer regions), MREs make up about half of the motifs.

As of 2014, the miRBase web site, an archive of miRNA sequences and annotations, listed 28,645 entries in 233 biologic species. Of these, 1,881 miRNAs were in annotated human miRNA loci. miRNAs were predicted to each have an average of about four hundred target mRNAs (causing gene silencing of several hundred genes). Freidman et al. estimate that &gt;45,000 miRNA target sites within human mRNA 3&#x27;UTRs are conserved above background levels, and &gt;60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs.

Direct experiments show that a single miRNA can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mRNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (less than 2-fold).

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer. For instance, in gastrointestinal cancers, nine miRNAs have been identified as epigenetically altered and effective in down regulating DNA repair enzymes.

The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and autism spectrum disorders.

== Applications ==

=== Medical research ===
Gene silencing techniques have been widely used by researchers to study genes associated with disorders. These disorders include cancer, infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Gene silencing is also currently being used in drug discovery efforts, such as synthetic lethality, high-throughput screening, and miniaturized RNAi screens.

====Cancer====
RNA interference has been used to silence genes associated with several cancers. In &quot;in vitro&quot; studies of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), siRNA was used to cleave the fusion protein, BCR-ABL, which prevents the drug Gleevec (imatinib) from binding to the cancer cells. Cleaving the fusion protein reduced the amount of transformed hematopoietic cells that spread throughout the body by increasing the sensitivity of the cells to the drug. RNA interference can also be used to target specific mutants. For instance, siRNAs were able to bind specifically to tumor suppressor p53 molecules containing a single point mutation and destroy it, while leaving the wild-type suppressor intact.

Receptors involved in mitogenic pathways that lead to the increased production of cancer cells there have also been targeted by siRNA molecules. The chemokine receptor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), associated with the proliferation of breast cancer, was cleaved by siRNA molecules that reduced the number of divisions commonly observed by the cancer cells. Researchers have also used siRNAs to selectively regulate the expression of cancer-related genes. Antiapoptotic proteins, such as clusterin and survivin, are often expressed in cancer cells. Clusterin and survivin-targeting siRNAs were used to reduce the number of antiapoptotic proteins and, thus, increase the sensitivity of the cancer cells to chemotherapy treatments. &quot;In vivo&quot; studies are also being increasingly utilized to study the potential use of siRNA molecules in cancer therapeutics. For instance, mice implanted with colon adenocarcinoma cells were found to survive longer when the cells were pretreated with siRNAs that targeted B-catenin in the cancer cells.

====Infectious disease====

=====Viruses=====
Viral genes and host genes that are required for viruses to replicate or enter the cell, or that play an important role in the life cycle of the virus are often targeted by antiviral therapies. RNAi has been used to target genes in several viral diseases, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis. In particular, siRNA was used to silence the primary HIV receptor chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). This prevented the virus from entering the human peripheral blood lymphocytes and the primary hematopoietic stem cells. A similar technique was used to decrease the amount of the detectable virus in hepatitis B and C infected cells. In hepatitis B, siRNA silencing was used to target the surface antigen on the hepatitis B virus and led to a decrease in the number of viral components. In addition, siRNA techniques used in hepatitis C were able to lower the amount of the virus in the cell by 98%.

RNA interference has been in commercial use to control virus diseases of plants for over 20 years (see Plant disease resistance). In 1986–1990, multiple examples of &quot;coat protein-mediated resistance&quot; against plant viruses were published, before RNAi had been discovered. In 1993, work with tobacco etch virus first demonstrated that host organisms can target specific virus or mRNA sequences for degradation, and that this activity is the mechanism behind some examples of virus resistance in transgenic plants. The discovery of small interfering RNAs (the specificity determinant in RNA-mediated gene silencing) also utilized virus-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants. By 1994, transgenic squash varieties had been generated expressing coat protein genes from three different viruses, providing squash hybrids with field-validated multiviral resistance that remain in commercial use at present. Potato lines expressing viral replicase sequences that confer resistance to potato leafroll virus were sold under the trade names NewLeaf Y and NewLeaf Plus, and were widely accepted in commercial production in 1999–2001, until McDonald&#x27;s Corp. decided not to purchase GM potatoes and Monsanto decided to close their NatureMark potato business. Another frequently cited example of virus resistance mediated by gene silencing involves papaya, where the Hawaiian papaya industry was rescued by virus-resistant GM papayas produced and licensed by university researchers rather than a large corporation. These papayas also remain in use at present, although not without significant public protest, which is notably less evident in medical uses of gene silencing.

Gene silencing techniques have also been used to target other viruses, such as the human papilloma virus, the West Nile virus, and the Tulane virus. The E6 gene in tumor samples retrieved from patients with the human papilloma virus was targeted and found to cause apoptosis in the infected cells. Plasmid siRNA expression vectors used to target the West Nile virus were also able to prevent the replication of viruses in cell lines. In addition, siRNA has been found to be successful in preventing the replication of the Tulane virus, part of the virus family Caliciviridae, by targeting both its structural and non-structural genes. By targeting the NTPase gene, one dose of siRNA 4 hours pre-infection was shown to control Tulane virus replication for 48 hours post-infection, reducing the viral titer by up to 2.6 logarithms. Although the Tulane virus is species-specific and does not affect humans, it has been shown to be closely related to the human norovirus, which is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis and food-borne disease outbreaks in the United States. Human noroviruses are notorious for being difficult to study in the laboratory, but the Tulane virus offers a model through which to study this family of viruses for the clinical goal of developing therapies that can be used to treat illnesses caused by human norovirus.

=====Bacteria=====

Unlike viruses, bacteria are not as susceptible to silencing by siRNA. This is largely due to how bacteria replicate. Bacteria replicate outside of the host cell and do not contain the necessary machinery for RNAi to function. However, bacterial infections can still be suppressed by siRNA by targeting the host genes that are involved in the immune response caused by the infection or by targeting the host genes involved in mediating the entry of bacteria into cells. For instance, siRNA was used to reduce the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines expressed in the cells of mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The reduced expression of the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), in turn, caused a reduction in the septic shock felt by the LPS-treated mice. In addition, siRNA was used to prevent the bacteria, &quot;Psueomonas aeruginosa&quot;, from invading murine lung epithelial cells by knocking down the caveolin-2 (CAV2) gene. Thus, though bacteria cannot be directly targeted by siRNA mechanisms, they can still be affected by siRNA when the components involved in the bacterial infection are targeted.

====Respiratory diseases====
Ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides, and more recently RNAi have been used to target mRNA molecules involved in asthma. These experiments have suggested that siRNA may be used to combat other respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis. COPD is characterized by goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion. Mucus secretion was found to be reduced when the transforming growth factor (TGF)-α was targeted by siRNA in NCI-H292 human airway epithelial cells. In addition to mucus hypersecretion, chronic inflammation and damaged lung tissue are characteristic of COPD and asthma. The transforming growth factor TGF-β is thought to play a role in these manifestations. As a result, when interferon (IFN)-γ was used to knock down TGF-β, fibrosis of the lungs, caused by damage and scarring to lung tissue, was improved.

====Neurodegenerative disorders====

=====Huntington&#x27;s disease=====
Huntington&#x27;s disease (HD) results from a mutation in the huntingtin gene that causes an excess of CAG repeats. The gene then forms a mutated huntingtin protein with polyglutamine repeats near the amino terminus. This disease is incurable and known to cause motor, cognitive, and behavioral deficits. Researchers have been looking to gene silencing as a potential therapeutic for HD.

Gene silencing can be used to treat HD by targeting the mutant huntingtin protein. The mutant huntingtin protein has been targeted through gene silencing that is allele specific using allele specific oligonucleotides. In this method, the antisense oligonucleotides are used to target single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), which are single nucleotide changes in the DNA sequence, since HD patients have been found to share common SNPs that are associated with the mutated huntingtin allele. It has been found that approximately 85% of patients with HD can be covered when three SNPs are targeted. In addition, when antisense oligonucleotides were used to target an HD-associated SNP in mice, there was a 50% decrease in the mutant huntingtin protein.

Non-allele specific gene silencing using siRNA molecules has also been used to silence the mutant huntingtin proteins. Through this approach, instead of targeting SNPs on the mutated protein, all of the normal and mutated huntingtin proteins are targeted. When studied in mice, it was found that siRNA could reduce the normal and mutant huntingtin levels by 75%. At this level, they found that the mice developed improved motor control and a longer survival rate when compared to the controls. Thus, gene silencing methods may prove to be beneficial in treating HD.

=====Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis=====

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, is a motor neuron disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. The disease causes motor neurons to degenerate, which eventually leads to neuron death and muscular degeneration. Hundreds of mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene have been found to cause ALS. Gene silencing has been used to knock down the SOD1 mutant that is characteristic of ALS. In specific, siRNA molecules have been successfully used to target the SOD1 mutant gene and reduce its expression through allele-specific gene silencing.

==== Therapeutics challenges ====
There are several challenges associated with gene silencing therapies, including delivery and specificity for targeted cells. For instance, for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, molecules for a prospective gene silencing therapy must be delivered to the brain. The blood–brain barrier makes it difficult to deliver molecules into the brain through the bloodstream by preventing the passage of the majority of molecules that are injected or absorbed into the blood. Thus, researchers have found that they must directly inject the molecules or implant pumps that push them into the brain.

Once inside the brain, however, the molecules must move inside of the targeted cells. In order to efficiently deliver siRNA molecules into the cells, viral vectors can be used. Nevertheless, this method of delivery can also be problematic as it can elicit an immune response against the molecules. In addition to delivery, specificity has also been found to be an issue in gene silencing. Both antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA molecules can potentially bind to the wrong mRNA molecule. Thus, researchers are searching for more efficient methods to deliver and develop specific gene silencing therapeutics that are still safe and effective.

<text>A shrubbery, shrub border or shrub garden is a part of a garden where shrubs, mostly flowering species, are thickly planted. The original shrubberies were mostly sections of large gardens, with one or more paths winding through it, a less-remembered aspect of the English landscape garden with very few original 18th-century examples surviving. As the fashion spread to smaller gardens, linear shrub borders covered up walls and fences, and were typically underplanted with smaller herbaceous flowering plants. By the late 20th century, shrubs, trees and smaller plants tend to be mixed together in the most visible parts of the garden, hopefully blending successfully. At the same time, shrubs, especially very large ones, have become part of the woodland garden, mixed in with trees, both native species and imported ornamental varieties. 

The word is first recorded by the OED in a letter of 1748 by Henrietta Knight, Lady Luxborough to the fanatical gardener William Shenstone: &quot;Nature has been so remarkably kind this last Autumn to adorn my Shrubbery with the flowers that usually blow at Whitsuntide&quot;. The shrubbery developed to display exciting new imported flowering species, initially mostly from the East Coast of British America, and quickly replaced the older formal &quot;wilderness&quot;, with compartments of smaller trees surrounded by hedges, and little colour. It was a further part of the garden, beyond the terrace and flower garden that the house usually opened onto, and when mature provided shade on hot days, some shelter from a wind, and some privacy. 
The shrubbery was at first the development of the plant collector wing of the growing movement of English gardeners, who in the early and mid-18th century eagerly awaited the new seeds and cuttings arriving at London nurserymen such as Thomas Fairchild (d. 1729) from America. There was some tension between them and the more landscape-oriented gardeners such as Capability Brown, though Brown&#x27;s designs in fact allowed for flower gardens and shrubberies, which have very rarely survived as well as his landscape vistas in the parks. 

Shrubbery is also the collective noun for shrubs in other contexts, sometimes used for shrubland, a type of natural landscape dominated by shrubs or bushes. The many distinct types of these include fynbos, maquis, shrub-steppe, shrub swamp and moorland.

==18th century==
According to the garden historian Mark Laird, &quot;by the early 1750s, we may reasonably claim that the shrubbery had been invented&quot;. The exact appearance of the earliest examples needs careful reconstruction from such plans, letters, poems and visual images as have survived. A high proportion seem to have been viewed from &quot;serpentine&quot; paths, already a very fashionable layout for gardens, using an expanded version of the line of beauty promoted by William Hogarth&#x27;s book &quot;The Analysis of Beauty&quot; of 1753. In plans some of these proceed in a single overall direction, with several more or less curves to left and right, and often no exit shown at the end. With large shrubs these would first bring plants into view when fairly close, supplying a succession of surprises. There was great emphasis on &quot;graduation&quot; in planting, with shorter plants, including herbaceous flowers, at the front near the path or lawn, with middle-sized ones behind, and the largest, and any trees, at the back. This principle, to some extent self-evident, has governed much planting ever since, for example that of Gertrude Jekyll, but was rather novel in European gardening at this point, where the different sizes of plants were usually planted in different areas.

==19th century==
A shrubbery was a feature of 19th-century gardens in the English manner, or the gardenesque style of the early part of the century. A shrubbery was a collection of hardy shrubs, quite distinct from a flower garden, which was also a cutting garden to supply flowers in the house. The shrubbery was arranged as a walk, ideally a winding one, that made a circuit that brought the walker back to the terrace of the house. Its paths were gravel, so that they dried quickly after a rain. A walk in the shrubbery offered a chance for a private conversation, and a winding walk among shrubs surrounding even quite a small lawn was a feature of the garden behind a well-furnished Regency suburban villa.

&quot;Mr Rushworth,&quot; said Lady Bertram, &quot;if I were you, I would have a very pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather.&quot; —Jane Austen, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814).
In the later part of the 19th century hardy Asian shrubs from the hills around the Himalayas and Western China became the most exciting new additions to the European garden, and large Asian rhododendrons now often dominate shrubberies and woodland gardens planted in the period that have not been carefully maintained, especially the invasive &quot;rhododendron ponticum&quot;. This had a wide range across Asia, extending to southern Spain, and it was introduced to England in the 1760s. But many sections of gardens, mostly from about 1890 to 1950, were planted as &quot;rhododendron gardens&quot; or &quot;azealea gardens&quot; from the start.

A variant on this, from the 1890s onwards, was a European interpretation of the Japanese garden, whose aesthetic was introduced to the English-speaking world by Josiah Conder&#x27;s &quot;Landscape Gardening in Japan&quot; (Kelly &amp; Walsh, 1893). Conder was a British architect who had worked for the Japanese government and other clients in Japan from 1877 until his death. The book was published when the general trend of Japonisme, or Japanese influence in the arts of the West, was already well-established, and sparked the first Japanese gardens in the West. Initially these were mostly sections of large private gardens, but as the style grew in popularity, many Japanese gardens were, and continue to be, added to public parks and gardens. These are to a large extent planted with shrubs, as well as small trees.

Technically the rose garden is a specialized type of shrub garden, but it is normally treated as a type of flower garden, if only because its origins in Europe go back to at least the Middle Ages in Europe, when roses were effectively the largest and most popular flowers, already existing in numerous garden cultivars. Roses were never out of fashion, but received a great boost in the 19th century, as many hybrids from Asian species were developed, above all from &quot;rosa chinensis&quot; (the &quot;China rose&quot;), which is still the dominant parent in most modern garden roses. Large rose gardens became highly popular as features of public parks at the end of the century, and remained popular additions in the 20th. Many rose breeders also show off their plants in gardens at their nurseries.

==20th century==
After the turn of the new century Gertrude Jekyll offered a chapter of suggestions for &quot;Wood and Shrubbery Edges&quot; in &quot;Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden&quot; (London, 1908) in which her descriptions were based on her own garden at Munstead Wood, south of Godalming, Surrey, but her shrubbery and hardy perennial plantings were designed to soften transitions: &quot;Where woodland joins garden ground there is often a sudden jolt; the wood ends with a hard line, sometimes with a path along it, accentuating the defect.&quot; In the expansive space of even a small Edwardian garden, Miss Jekyll recommended a space &quot;from twenty-five to forty feet&quot; planted so as to bring wood and garden into harmony, &quot;so planted as to belong equally to garden and wood.&quot; Rhododendrons were the stand-by in these shrub belts, combined with ferns, wood-rush, lilies, white foxgloves and white columbines.

==Structural components==

In the 1980s John Nash&#x27;s never-executed plans for the garden setting of the Brighton Pavilion, illustrated in Nash&#x27;s volume &quot;Views of the Royal Pavilion&quot; (1826), were finally carried out in connection with the extensive restorations of the Pavilion itself. Its &quot;fairly open landscape of soft lawns dotted with trees and set with lightly-wooded, sinuous shrubberies&quot; are best illustrated in Augustus Charles Pugin&#x27;s watercolor view c. 1822 of the west front of the Pavilion, reproduced in Nash&#x27;s publication. The winding perimeter walk circling the lawn among the shrubs and trees, enriched with island beds of herbaceous perennials, began to be laid out in 1814, with a flush of activity 1817-21. Two books of commentaries proved indispensable for the replanting scheme. One was Henry Phillips, who wrote in 1823
The shrubbery is a style of pleasure-garden which seems to owe its creation to the idea that our sublime poet formed of Eden. It originated in England and is as peculiar to the British nation as landscape planting.

The formulas for arranging a shrubbery were founded on contemporary painterly requirements for the Picturesque; judicious contrast and variety were essential, but Philips seems to have been among the first garden writers to notice that yellowish-green leaves in the foreground seem to throw bluish green-leaved shrubs deeper into a perceived distance. The desirable undulations of paths and islands and bands of shrub plantings would ideally undulate in elevation too: &quot;break up the level by throwing up elevations,&#x27; Philips suggested, &quot;so as to answer the double purpose of obscuring private walks and screening other parts from the wind.&quot;

Nash was at work also on the public parks of London, devising the shrubberies of Regent&#x27;s Park and of St. James&#x27;s Park, where the German visitor Prince Pückler-Muskau discerned that
Mr Nash ... masses the shrubs more closely together, allows the grass to disappear in wide sweeps under the plants or lets it run along the edges of the shrubs without trimming them ... hence they soon develop into a thicket that gracefully bends over the lawn without showing anywhere a sharply defined outline

Such precise effects were made immeasurably simpler by the invention in 1827 by the English engineer Edwin Beard Budding of the rotary lawn mower, an extrapolation of machinery commonly used to cut velvet pile.

<text>The Bren gun was a series of light machine guns (LMG) made by the United Kingdom in the 1930s and used in various roles until 1992. While best known for its role as the British and Commonwealth forces&#x27; primary infantry LMG in World War II, it was also used in the Korean War and saw service throughout the latter half of the 20th century, including the 1982 Falklands War. Although fitted with a bipod, it could also be mounted on a tripod or be vehicle-mounted.

The Bren gun was a licensed version of the Czechoslovak ZGB 33 light machine gun which, in turn, was a modified version of the ZB vz. 26, which British Army officials had tested during a firearms service competition in the 1930s. The later Bren gun featured a distinctive top-mounted curved box magazine, conical flash hider, and quick change barrel. 

The designer was Václav Holek, a gun inventor and design engineer.

In the 1950s, many Bren guns were re-barrelled to accept the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge and modified to feed from the magazine for the L1 (Commonwealth version of the FN FAL) rifle as the L4 light machine gun. It was replaced in the British Army as the section LMG by the L7 general-purpose machine gun (GPMG), a belt-fed weapon. This was supplemented in the 1980s by the L86 Light Support Weapon firing the 5.56×45mm NATO round, leaving the Bren gun in use only as a pintle mount on some vehicles. The Bren gun was manufactured by Indian Ordnance Factories as the &quot;Gun Machine 7.62mm 1B&quot; before it was discontinued in 2012.

==Name==
The name &quot;Bren&quot; was derived from Brno, the city in Czechoslovakia, where the Zb vz. 26 was designed (in the Zbrojovka Brno Factory) and Enfield, site of the British Royal Small Arms Factory.

==Development==

At the close of World War I in 1918, the British Army was equipped with two main automatic weapons; the Vickers medium machine gun (MMG) and the Lewis light machine gun. The Vickers was heavy and required a supply of water to keep it in operation, which tended to relegate it to static defence and indirect fire support. The Lewis, although lighter, was still heavy and was prone to frequent stoppages: its barrel could not be changed in the field, which meant that sustained firing resulted in overheating until it stopped altogether. 

In 1922, to find a replacement for the Lewis, the Small Arms Committee of the British Army ran competitive trials between the Madsen machine gun, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), the Hotchkiss M1909 machine gun, the Beardmore–Farquhar rifle, and the Lewis itself. Although the BAR was recommended, the sheer number of Lewis guns available and the difficult financial conditions meant that nothing was done. Various new models of light machine gun were tested as they became available, and in 1930, a further set of extensive trials commenced, overseen by Frederick Hubert Vinden. This time the weapons tested included the SIG Neuhausen KE7, the Vickers–Berthier and the Czechoslovak ZB vz. 27. The last did not meet high requirements for durability and reliability, mainly because gunpowder residue from British cordite was obstructing the gas tube (ZB vz. 27 was also sent in 7.92 Mauser instead of .303 British, but ZB already held a patent for a staggered magazine for rimmed rounds). The Vickers–Berthier was later adopted by the Indian Army because it could be manufactured at once, rather than wait for the British Lewis production run to finish; it too saw extensive service in World War II.

A modified variant with a shortened gas tube was tested again in June 1932, and then newly developed ZB-30 in .303 yet again tested in November. Receiving more feedback and incorporating it into the design by January 1933, yet two other modifications were tested by British representatives in Brno in July. One of the variants was selected, designated ZGB 33 (for Zbrojovka, United Kingdom, 33), and 10 samples were sent to England in autumn 1933. After additional trials in early 1934, more samples were ordered during the summer of 1934, and on May 24, 1935, the licence for British manufacture was finally acquired, and the design was adopted under the Bren name.

The major changes were in the magazine and barrel and the lower pistol grip assembly which went from a swivelling grip frame pivoted on the front of the trigger guard to a sliding grip frame which included the forward tripod mount and sliding ejection port cover. The magazine was curved in order to feed the rimmed .303 inch SAA (&quot;Small Arms Ammunition&quot;) cartridge, a change from the various rimless Mauser-design cartridges such as the 7.9-mm Mauser round previously used by Czech designs. These modifications were categorised in various numbered designations, ZB vz. 27, ZB vz. 30, ZB vz. 32, and finally the ZGB 33, which was licensed for manufacture under the Bren name.

The Bren was a gas-operated weapon using the same .303 ammunition as the standard British bolt-action rifle, the Lee–Enfield, firing at a rate between 480 and 540 rounds per minute (rpm), depending on the model. Propellant gases vented from a port towards the muzzle end of the barrel through a regulator (visible just in front of the bipod) with four quick-adjustment apertures of different sizes, intended to tailor the gas volume to different ambient temperatures (smallest flow at high temperature, e.g. summer desert, largest at low temperature, e.g. winter Arctic). The vented gas drove a piston which in turn actuated the breech block. Each gun came with a spare barrel that could be quickly changed when the barrel became hot during sustained fire, though later guns featured a chrome-lined barrel, which reduced the need for a spare. To change barrels, the release catch in front of the magazine was rotated to unlock the barrel. The carrying handle above the barrel was used to grip and remove the hot barrel without burning the hands.

The Bren was magazine-fed, which slowed its rate of fire and required more frequent reloading than British belt-fed machine guns such as the larger .303 Vickers machine gun. The slower rate of fire prevented more rapid overheating of the Bren&#x27;s air-cooled barrel, and the Bren was much lighter than belt-fed machine guns, which typically had cooling jackets, often liquid filled. The magazines also prevented the ammunition from getting dirty, which was more of a problem with the Vickers with its 250-round canvas belts. The sights were offset to the left, to avoid the magazine on the top of the weapon. The position of the sights meant that the Bren could be fired only from the right shoulder.

==Service==
===World War II===
In the British and Commonwealth armies, the Bren was generally issued on a scale of one per rifle section. An infantry battalion also had a &quot;carrier&quot; platoon, equipped with Universal Carriers, each of which carried a Bren gun. Parachute battalions from 1944 had an extra Bren in the Anti-tank platoon. The 66-man &quot;Assault Troop&quot; of British Commandos had a nominal establishment of four Bren guns. Realising the need for additional section-level firepower, the British Army endeavoured to issue the Bren in great numbers, with a stated goal of one Bren to every four private soldiers. The Bren was operated by a two-man crew, sometimes commanded by a Lance Corporal as an infantry section&#x27;s &quot;gun group&quot;, the remainder of the section forming the &quot;rifle group&quot;. The gunner or &quot;Number 1&quot; carried and fired the Bren, and a loader or &quot;Number 2&quot; carried extra magazines, a spare barrel and a tool kit. Number 2 helped reload the gun and replace the barrel when it overheated, and spotted targets for Number 1.

Generally, the Bren was fired from the prone position using the attached bipod. On occasion, a Bren gunner would use his weapon on the move supported by a sling, much like an automatic rifle, and from standing or kneeling positions. Using the sling, Australian soldiers regularly fired the Bren from the hip, for instance in the marching fire tactic, a form of suppressive fire moving forward in assault. A Victoria Cross was awarded to Private Bruce Kingsbury for such use at Isurava, New Guinea, in 1942, during the Australians&#x27; fighting retreat from Kokoda.

Each British soldier&#x27;s equipment normally included two magazines for his section&#x27;s Bren gun. The large ammunition pouches on the 1937 pattern web equipment were designed around the Bren magazine. The Bren was regarded as the principal weapon of an infantry section, providing the majority of its firepower. As such, all ranks were expected to be &quot;experts in its use&quot;.

The Bren had an effective range of around when fired from a prone position with a bipod. It could deliver a beaten ground of by at on the bipod. A &#x27;rapid&#x27; fire rate of 120 rounds per minute (four magazines a minute) was sustainable with a barrel change after ten magazines (or reduction in fire rate) to limit wear but doctrine was to fire in 4-5 round bursts. Soldiers were instructed to fire single-shot in imitation of rifle fire to conceal the presence of an automatic weapon.

For a light machine gun of the interwar and early World War II era, the Bren was about average in weight. On long marches in non-operational areas it was often partially disassembled and its parts were carried by two soldiers. The top-mounted magazine vibrated and moved during fire, making the weapon more visible in combat, and many Bren gunners used paint or improvised canvas covers to disguise the prominent magazine.

The 30-round magazine was in practice usually filled with 27 or 28 rounds to prevent jams and for magazines kept full for a long time 20 rounds to avoid wearing out the magazine spring. Care needed to be taken when loading the magazine to ensure that each round went ahead of the previous round, so that the .303 cartridge rims did not overlap the wrong way, which would cause a jam. The spent cartridge cases were ejected downwards, which was an improvement on the Lewis gun, which ejected sideways, since the glint of them flying through the air could compromise a concealed firing position.

In general, the Bren was considered a reliable and effective light machine gun, though in North Africa it was reported to jam regularly unless kept very clean and free of sand or dirt. It was popular with British troops, who respected its reliability and combat effectiveness. The quality of the materials used would generally ensure minimal jamming. When the gun did jam through fouling caused by prolonged firing, the operator could adjust the four-position gas regulator to feed more gas to the piston increasing the power to operate the mechanism. The barrel needed to be unlocked and slid forward slightly to allow the regulator to be turned. It was even said that all problems with the Bren could simply be cleared by hitting the gun, turning the regulator or doing both. It was &quot;by general consent the finest light machine gun in the world of its period, and the most useful weapon provided to the (French) &quot;maquis&quot; ... accurate up to 1,000 meters, and (it) could withstand immense maltreatment and unskilled use. &quot;Resistants&quot; were constantly pleading for maximum drops of Brens&quot;.
Although they were generally well-liked, the high cost of £40 each gun was an issue for the British Army leadership. This became a greater issue when it was discovered that only 2,300 of the 30,000 Bren guns issued to the British Expeditionary Force came back to the United Kingdom after the defeat of France. As the result, cost savings and increased rate of production became two main goals for subsequent variant designs. The Bren Mk II design simplified production by replacing the drum rear sight with a ladder design, making the bipod legs non-adjustable, simplifying the gun butt, reducing the use of stainless steel, among other steps that reduced the cost by 20% to 25%; Mk II was approved in September 1940 and entered production in 1941. While the Bren Mk III design also aimed at reducing cost, it also had the concurrent goal of being lightened for jungle warfare; the final product weighed , 3 pounds lighter than the original Bren Mk I design; it was standardised in July 1944 and saw a production of 57,600. Also standardised in July 1944 was the Bren Mk IV, which was further lightened to ; however, it did not enter production until July 1945, and only 250 were built before the end of the war. While Enfield was able to produce only 400 Bren Mk I guns each month, with the various simplification efforts production numbers rose to 1,000 guns per week by 1943. Later designs of production Bren guns featured chrome-lined barrels that offered less resistance, preventing overheating and reducing the need for quick changes of barrels.

Bren guns were produced outside of the United Kingdom as well. In Canada, the John Inglis plant in Toronto began tooling its facilities for production in 1938; the first of 186,000 examples was completed in March 1940. Some of the Inglis-built Bren guns were chambered for the 7.92-mm Mauser ammunition; these were destined for export to Nationalist Chinese forces rather than for British and Commonwealth forces. In Australia, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in New South Wales began building Bren guns in 1940; a total of 17,249 were built. In India, the factory at Ishapore began building Bren guns in 1942 (it had produced Vickers-Berthier machine guns prior to this time), and would continue producing them for decades long after the end of World War II. Many of the Bren guns produced at Ishapore went to Indian troops, who had lost a great number of automatic weapons during the disastrous campaigns against the Japanese in Malaya and Burma; 17th Indian Infantry Division, for example, found itself with only 56 Bren guns after fleeing out of Burma in 1942.
A tripod mount with 42 degrees of traverse was available to allow the Bren to be used on &quot;fixed lines&quot; of fire for defensive shooting at pre-determined areas in the dark or if obscured by fog or smoke. The Bren was also used on many vehicles, the Universal Carrier also known as the &quot;Bren Gun Carrier&quot;, and on tanks and armoured cars. The Carrier was intended to use its &quot;armour, speed and cross country performance&quot; to bring the gun team into position from where it would fire dismounted; firing from the vehicle only in an emergency. 
The Bren could not be used as a co-axial weapon on tanks, as the magazine restricted its depression and was awkward to handle in confined spaces, and it was therefore used on a pintle mount only. (The belt fed Vickers or Besa, the latter being another Czechoslovak machine gun design adopted by the British, were instead used as co-axial weapons.) An unfortunate problem occurred when the Bren was fired from the Dingo Scout Car; the hot cartridge cases tended to be ejected down the neck of the driver, whose position was next to the pintle. A canvas bag was designed to catch the cartridges and overcome the problem, but it seems to have been rarely issued.
The Bren was also employed in the anti-aircraft role with the tripod reconfigured for high angle fire. There were also several designs of less-portable mountings, including the &quot;Gallows&quot; and &quot;Mottley&quot; mounts. A 100-round pan magazine was available for the Bren for use in the anti-aircraft role.

The Bren&#x27;s direct ancestor, the Czechoslovak ZB vz. 26, was also used in World War II by German and Romanian forces, including units of the Waffen SS. Many 7.92 mm ZB light machine guns were shipped to China, where they were employed first against the Japanese in World War II, and later against UN forces in Korea, including British and Commonwealth units. Some ex-Chinese Czech ZB weapons were also in use in the early stages of the Vietnam War. Production of a 7.92 mm round model for the Far East was carried out by Inglis of Canada. The Bren was also delivered to the Soviet Union as part of the lend-lease program.

===Post-war===
The British Army, and the armies of various countries of the Commonwealth, used the Bren in the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, the Mau Mau Uprising and the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, where it was preferred to its replacement, the belt-fed L7 GPMG, on account of its lighter weight. In the conflict in Northern Ireland (1969–1998), a British Army squad typically carried the L4A4 version of the Bren as the squad automatic weapon in the 1970s. During the Falklands War in 1982, 40 Commando Royal Marines carried one LMG and one GPMG per section. Its final operational deployment with the British Army, on a limited scale, was in the First Gulf War in 1991.
When the British Army adopted the 7.62 mm NATO cartridge, the Bren was re-designed to 7.62 mm calibre, fitted with a new bolt, barrel and magazine. It was re-designated as the &quot;L4 light machine gun&quot; (in various sub-versions) and remained in British Army service into the 1990s. A slotted flash hider similar to that of the contemporary L1 rifle and L7 general purpose machine gun replaced the conical flash hider. The change from a rimmed to rimless cartridge and nearly straight magazine improved feeding considerably, and allowed use of 20-round magazines from the 7.62 mm L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle. Bren gunners using the L4A1 were normally issued with the 30-round magazine from the SAW L2A1.

Completion of the move to a 5.56 mm NATO cartridge led to the Army removing the Bren/L4 from the list of approved weapons and then withdrawing it from service.

The Mark III Bren remained in limited use with the Army Reserve of the Irish Defence Forces until 2006, when the 7.62 mm GPMG replaced it. The Bren was popular with the soldiers who fired it (known as Brenners) as it was light and durable, and had a reputation for accuracy. The most notable use of the Bren by Irish forces was in the Congo Crisis during the 1960s, when the Bren was the regular army&#x27;s standard section automatic weapon.

Bren guns were in service with the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Rhodesian Bush War, including a substantial number re-chambered for 7.62 mm cartridges similar to those examples in the British Army. The Rhodesian Bren guns continued to see frequent action until the 1970s, when they were largely replaced by the FN MAG. A few were captured and re-issued by the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). Some examples were still in service with reservists of the British South Africa Police in 1980, and were inherited by the Zimbabwe Republic Police upon the country&#x27;s internationally recognised independence. Zimbabwean policemen continued to deploy Bren guns during operations against ZIPRA dissidents throughout the early 1980s.

The South African Defence Force deployed Bren guns during the South African Border War alongside the more contemporary FN MAG as late as 1978.

==Variants==
===Mark 1===
Introduced September 1937; the original Czechoslovak designed ZGB 33. Overall length , barrel length. Weight .

Features:
* Drum-pattern rear aperture sight
* Buttstrap for use over-the-shoulder when firing
* Rear grip under butt
* Telescoping bipod
* Folding cocking handle

An Enfield-made .303 Bren Mk 1 was converted to 7.92mm in 1938 due to the suggestion of a possibility of a British Army change over to a rimless cartridge for machine guns being mooted.

===Mark 2===
Introduced 1941. A simplified version of the Mk1 more suited to wartime production with original design features subsequently found to be unnecessary deleted. Produced by Inglis of Canada and the Monotype Group through a number of component manufacturing factories. Sometimes known as the &quot;Garage hands&quot; model. Overall length , barrel length. Weight .

Features:
* Folding-leaf rear sight
* Buttstrap deleted
* Rear grip deleted
* Fixed height bipod
* Fixed cocking handle

The Bren Mk2 was much simplified in the body, which although still being milled from a solid billet of steel, required significantly fewer milling operations than the Mk1, resulting in a much cleaner appearance. The bipod was simplified in design as well as not having extending legs. Most Mk2 bipods resembled a simple A-frame and were more &#x27;soldier proof&#x27;. The Mk2 also featured a slightly higher rate of fire than the Mk1.

The woodwork on the Mk2 was simplified by being less ornate and ergonomic, which sped up the manufacturing process. The barrel was also simplified by means of a non-stepped removable flash hider and, in some cases, a barrel fore-end that was matte instead of highly polished. The buffered buttplate of the Mk1 was omitted and replaced with a sheet metal buttplate.

A small number of Inglis-made .303 Bren Mk 2 were converted post-war to fire the .280 in (7 mm) Mk 1Z round used by the EM-2 rifle.

The Inglis version of the Bren Mk 2 chambered for the .30-06 (7.62 mm) cartridge and known as the M41 was also manufactured in Taiwan after the end of the Chinese Civil War.

===Mark 3===
A shorter and lighter Bren made by Enfield from 1944 for the war in the East and for Airborne Forces. This was similar to the Mk2 but with the light weight features of the early Mk1, with the main distinguishing feature being a shorter barrel and serrated area in front of the barrel nut. Overall length , barrel length. Weight .

===Mark 4===
As with the Mk3 but this was a conversion of a Mk2. Overall length , barrel length. Weight .

===L4===
The Bren was converted to 7.62×51mm NATO in the 1950s, and designated the L4. L4 Brens can easily be identified by their straighter magazine and cylindrical flash hider. The British-issue L4 magazine retains the 30-round capacity and has a slight curve. The L4 magazine was interchangeable with the L1A1 SLR magazine, so the L4 Bren can be seen fitted with straight 20-round magazines from the SLR or with the straight 30-round magazine from the Australian L2A1 or Canadian C2A1 heavy-barrel SLR. The flash suppressor was changed from the cone type of .303 variants to a slotted, cylindrical type similar in appearance to that used on the SLR and L7 GPMG. The L4 remained in British service until the 1990s.

==Besal gun==
The Besal or Faulkner light machine gun was a Bren-inspired emergency design developed in the aftermath of the French campaign and the Dunkirk Evacuation in which the British Expeditionary Force lost almost 30,000 Brens and given the vulnerability of a single, well known, manufacturing site for the Bren at Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield. Developed in 1940 by Harry Faulker of the Birmingham Small Arms Company, the Besal looks much like a Bren, but was developed with much simplified machining operations in mind to allow it to be produced in any machine shop. Unlike the Bren, the Besal was full automatic only rather than select fire and lacked a cocking handle, using the pistol grip instead. In Mark 2 format the Besal had no interchangeable parts with the Bren, but was designed to use Bren magazines.

===Taden gun===

The Taden gun was a post-war development of the Bren to use with the .280 British (7 mm) intermediate round proposed to replace the .303 in British service. The Taden was belt-fed with either spade grips for MMG use or a buttstock and pistol grip for LMG use and would have replaced both the Bren and the Vickers machine gun. Although reliable it was not accepted due to the US-driven standardization within NATO on the larger 7.62×51mm NATO round.

==X11==
The X11 was a belt-fed Bren derivative developed by RSAF Enfield after the cancellation of the EM-2 rifle and Taden machine gun, adapting the Taden concepts to a Bren derived weapon in the new 7.62x51mm NATO standard round. It came second in trials behind the FN MAG.

===Semiautomatic Bren guns===
Many nations&#x27; militaries have disposed of their Bren guns as surplus to their needs. Surplus Brens have been imported to the United States for sale to collectors, but due to US gun laws restricting the importation of automatic weapons such guns must be legally destroyed by cutting up the receivers. A number of US gunsmiths have manufactured new semiautomatic Brens by welding the pieces of destroyed receivers back together, with modifications to prevent the use of full automatic parts, and fitting new fire-control components capable of only semiautomatic fire. The balance of the parts are surplus Bren parts. Such &quot;semiautomatic machine guns&quot; are legally considered rifles under US Federal law and the laws of most states.

==Production==
===United Kingdom===

Bren guns were produced at the Royal Small Arms Factory, in Enfield, London. The first Bren guns were built in September 1937, and by December, a total of 42 had been produced. Weekly production was 300 Brens a week in July 1938, and 400 a week in September 1939. 
The Monotype Group produced Mark 2 Brens. Enfield produced a total of 220,000 Mark I Bren guns, 57,600 in Mark III, and 250 in Mark IV.

===Canada===
John Inglis and Company received a contract from the British and Canadian governments in March 1938 to supply 5,000 Bren machine guns to the UK and 7,000 Bren machine guns to Canada. Both countries shared the capital costs of bringing in this new production facility. Production started in 1940; by August 1942, the Inglis plant was averaging 10,000 Brens per month, and produced 186,000 Bren guns of all variants by the end of the war, including 43,000 chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser for export to the Chinese National Revolutionary Army.

===India===
In 1942, the Ishapore Arsenal began to produce Bren guns, and continued to do so long after the end of World War II, also manufacturing variants in 7.62×51mm NATO.
A shadow factory for Ishapore was set up at Kanpur and produced .303 Brens before it was later rechambered to fire 7.62 NATO ammo in 1964 as the 1A LMG.

===Australia===
In 1940, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in New South Wales began to manufacture Bren guns, producing a total of 17,249 by 1945.

<text>Psychological pricing (also price ending or charm pricing) is a pricing and marketing strategy based on the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. In this pricing method, retail prices are often expressed as just-below numbers: numbers that are just a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or £2.98. There is evidence that consumers tend to perceive just-below prices (also referred to as &quot;odd prices&quot;) as being lower than they are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit. Thus, prices such as $1.99 may to some degree be associated with spending $1 rather than $2. The theory that drives this is that pricing practices such as this cause greater demand than if consumers were perfectly rational. Psychological pricing is one cause of price points.

==Overview==
According to a 1997 study published in the &quot;Marketing Bulletin&quot;, approximately 60% of prices in advertising material ended in the digit 9, 30% ended in the digit 5, 7% ended in the digit 0 and the remaining seven digits combined accounted for only slightly over 3% of prices evaluated. In the UK, before the withdrawal of the halfpenny coin in 1969, prices often ended in d (elevenpence halfpenny: just under a shilling, which was 12d); another example (before 1961) was £1/19/d. (one pound, nineteen shillings, and elevenpence three farthings) which is one farthing under £2. This is still seen today in gasoline (petrol) pricing ending in of the local currency&#x27;s smallest denomination; for example, in the US the price of a gallon of gasoline almost always ends at US$0.009 (e.g. US$3.599).

In a traditional cash transaction, fractional pricing imposes tangible costs on the vendor (printing fractional prices), the cashier (producing awkward change) and the customer (stowing the change). These factors have become less relevant with the increased use of checks, credit and debit cards, and other forms of currency-free exchange; also, in some jurisdictions the addition of sales tax makes the advertised price irrelevant and the final digit of the real transaction price effectively random.

The psychological pricing theory is based on one or more of the following hypotheses:

* Thomas and Morwitz (2005) coined the term &quot;left-digit effect&quot; and suggested that this bias is caused by the use of an anchoring heuristic in multi-digit comparisons.
* Another rationale for just-below pricing is prospect theory. This theory holds that consumers facing uncertainty in decision making base the value of an alternative on gains or losses offered by the alternative relative to some reference point, rather than on final absolute states of wealth or welfare. The theory also incorporates evidence that small deviations from a reference point tend to be over-valued. So, based on prospect theory, pricing something only a few cents under a whole dollar could be beneficial to the seller. This theory works well because of how the reference point is established by the consumer. The reference point for something that is $19.98 would be $20. This leads the just-below price to be seen as involving a gain, thus making it feel like a better deal.
* Consumers ignore the least significant digits rather than do the proper rounding. Even though the cents are seen and not totally ignored, they may subconsciously be partially ignored. Keith Coulter, Associate Professor of Marketing at the Graduate School of Management, Clark University, suggests that this effect may be enhanced when the cents are printed smaller (for example, $1999).
* Fractional prices suggest to consumers that goods are marked at the lowest possible price.
* When items are listed in a way that is segregated into price bands (such as an online real estate search), price ending is used to keep an item in a lower band, to be seen by more potential purchasers.

The theory of psychological pricing is controversial. Some studies show that buyers, even young children, have a very sophisticated understanding of true cost and relative value and that, to the limits of the accuracy of the test, they behave rationally. Other researchers claim that this ignores the non-rational nature of the phenomenon and that acceptance of the theory requires belief in a subconscious level of thought processes, a belief that economic models tend to deny or ignore. Results from research using modern scanner data are mixed.

Now that many customers are used to just-below pricing, some restaurants and high-end retailers psychologically-price in even numbers in an attempt to reinforce their brand image of quality and sophistication.

== Theories ==
Kaushik Basu used game theory in 1997 to argue that rational consumers value their own time and effort in calculation. Such consumers process the price from left to right and tend to mentally replace the last two digits of the price with an estimate of the mean &quot;cent component&quot; of all goods in the marketplace. In a sufficiently large marketplace, this implies that any individual seller can charge the largest possible &quot;cent component&quot; (99¢) without significantly affecting the average of cent components and without changing customer behavior. Ruffle and Shtudiner&#x27;s (2006) laboratory test shows considerable support for Basu&#x27;s 99-cent pricing equilibrium, particularly when other sellers&#x27; prices are observable.

The introduction of the euro in 2002, with its various exchange rates, distorted existing nominal price patterns while at the same time retaining real prices. A European wide study (el Sehity, Hoelzl and Kirchler, 2005) investigated consumer price digits before and after the euro introduction for price adjustments. The research showed a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the transition. Further, Benford&#x27;s Law as a benchmark for the investigation of price digits was successfully introduced into the context of pricing. The importance of this benchmark for detecting irregularities in prices was demonstrated and with it a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the nominal shock of the euro introduction.

Another phenomenon noted by economists is that a price point for a product (such as $4.99) remains stable for a long period of time, with companies slowly reducing the &quot;quantity&quot; of product in the package until consumers begin to notice. At this time, the price will increase marginally (to $5.05) and then within an exceptionally short time will increase to the next price point ($5.99, for example).

Several studies have shown that when prices are presented to a prospect in descending order (versus ascending order), positive effects for the seller result, mainly a willingness to pay a higher price, higher perceptions of value, and higher probability of purchase. The reason for this is that when presented in the former, the higher price serves as a reference point, and the lower prices are perceived favorably as a result.

===In consumer behavior===
Thomas and Morwitz (2005) suggested that this bias is a manifestation of the pervasive anchoring heuristic in multi-digit comparisons. (The anchoring heuristic is one of the heuristics identified by Nobel laureate Kahneman and his co-author Tversky.) Judgments of numerical differences are anchored on leftmost digits, causing a bias in relative magnitude judgments. This hypothesis suggests that people perceive the difference between 1.99 and 3.00 to be closer to 2 than to 1 because their judgments are anchored on the leftmost digit.

Stiving and Winer (1997) examined the left-digit effect using scanner panel models. They proposed that 9-ending prices can influence consumer behavior through two distinct processes: image effects and level effects. Image effect suggests that 99-ending prices are associated with images of sales promotions. Level effect captures the magnitude underestimation caused by anchoring on the leftmost digits of prices. Their results suggest that both of these effects account for the influence of 9-ending prices in grocery stores. Manning and Sprott (2009) demonstrated that left-digit anchoring can influence consumer choices using experimental studies.

Choi, Lee, and Ji (2012) examined the interactive effects of 9-ending prices and message framing in advertisements. The researchers found that when pairing nine-ending prices with positive messages, advertisements were much more positively received by consumers. This in turn increased their likelihood of making a purchase decision.

===In financial markets===
Left-digit effect has also been shown to influence stock-market transactions. Bhattacharya, Holden, and Jacobsen (2011) examined the left-digit effect in stock market transactions. They found that there was excess buying at just-below prices ($1.99) versus round numbers ($2.00) right above them. This discrepancy in buy-sell can lead to significant changes in 24-hour returns that can meaningfully impact markets.

===In public policy===
Research has also found psychological pricing relevant to the study of politics and public policy. For instance, a study of Danish municipal income taxes found evidence of &quot;odd taxation&quot; as tax rates with a nine-ending were found to be over-represented compared to other ending digits. Further, it was found that citizens&#x27; evaluations of public-school districts in a Danish population changed noticeably based on the leftmost digit. In particular, the researchers looked at minuscule changes in average grades that shifted the leftmost digit. Once this value changed, citizens responded more drastically and as such their stance in terms of public policy on the issue changed.

MacKillop &quot;et al.&quot; (2014) looked at how the left-digit effect affects the relationship between price hikes and smoking cessation. There was a very clearly demonstrated inverse relationship between the price of cigarettes and individual&#x27;s motivation to smoke. Researchers found that price hikes that impacted the leftmost digit in the price (i.e. $4.99 vs. $5.00) were particularly effective in causing change among adult smokers. These findings can be utilized by public policy researchers and legislators to implement more effective cigarette tax policies.

== Regulation ==
According to Davidovich-Weisberg (2013), in Israel several high-profile regulatory commissions have joined to ban retailers from charging prices ending in 99. These regulatory bodies have claimed that this was an attempt to make prices look less expensive to customers. In addition, due to the phasing out of certain denominations of coins in Israel, these quirky prices also made little practical sense in terms of everyday shopping.

==Historical comments==
Exactly how psychological pricing came into common use is not clear, though it is known the practice arose during the late 19th century. Scot Morris&#x27; 1979 &quot;Book of Strange Facts &amp; Useless Information&quot; speculated that it originated when Melville E. Stone founded the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in 1875 and priced it at one cent to compete with the nickel papers of the day; however, Cecil Adams has directly addressed Morris&#x27; claims, noting that Stone sold the &quot;News&quot; in 1876, and also that the &quot;News&quot; archives indicate that &quot;prices ending in 9 (39 cents, 69 cents, etc.) were rare until well into the 1880s and weren&#x27;t all that common then. The practice didn&#x27;t really become widespread until the 1920s, and even then prices as often as not ended in .95, not .99.&quot;

Others have suggested that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, there is a chance that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with a just-below price, the cashier must nearly always make change for the customer. This generally means opening the cash register which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier stealing from the store owner.

Since the registration is done with the process of returning change, according to Bill Bryson odd pricing came about because by charging odd amounts like 49 and 99 cents (or 45 and 95 cents when nickels are more used than pennies), the cashier very probably had to open the till for the penny change and thus announce the sale.

In the former Czechoslovakia, people called this pricing &quot;baťovská cena&quot; (&quot;Baťa&#x27;s price&quot;), referring to Tomáš Baťa, a Czech manufacturer of footwear. He began to widely use this practice in 1920.

Price ending has also been used by retailers to highlight sale or clearance items for administrative purposes. A retailer might end all regular prices in 95 and all sale prices in 50. This makes it easy for a buyer to identify which items are discounted when looking at a report.

In its 2005 United Kingdom general election manifesto, the Official Monster Raving Loony Party proposed the introduction of a 99-pence coin to &quot;save on change&quot;.

A recent trend in some monetary systems as inflation gradually reduces the value of money is to eliminate the smallest denomination coin (typically 0.01 of the local currency). The total cost of purchased items is then rounded up or down to, for example, the nearest 0.05. This may have an effect on future just-below pricing, especially at small retail outlets where single-item purchases are more common, encouraging vendors to price with .98 and .99 endings, which are rounded up when .05 is the smallest denomination, while .96 and .97 are rounded down. An example of this practice is in Australia, where 5 cents has been the smallest denomination coin since 1992, but pricing at .98 or .99 on items under several hundred dollars is still almost universally applied (e.g.: $1.99–299.99), while goods on sale often price at .94 and its variations. Finland and the Netherlands were the first two countries using the euro currency to eliminate the 1- and 2-cent coins.

<text>Vratislavice nad Nisou () is a self-governing borough of the city of Liberec in the Czech Republic. As of 2021, it has about 8,900 inhabitants. It straddles the Lusatian Neisse river between Liberec and Jablonec nad Nisou, around 3.5 km south-east of Liberec city centre.

==History==
The settlement of &quot;Wratislawicz&quot; was established, it is thought, in the 13th century by Bohemian colonists on the left bank of the river Nisa. The very first written document mentioning this place comes from the 1460s which by this stage had a stone church. The right bank of the Nisa was settled (as an independent village) during the 16th century by German speaking people from Silesia, and called the village Meffersdorf after the settlers&#x27; home village.
These two villages possessed not only different names, but even belonged to different governances (Liberec and Český Dub). After the Thirty Years&#x27; War the German name, mangled to Maffersdorf, became used for both places - the name Wratislawicz faded into obscurity.

Maffersdorf on the right bank (Liberec side) of Nisa continued to grow steadily. In 1701, construction of a new parish church was finished, designed by a Prague architect Marco Antonio Canavelli.

In the second half of the 19th century industrial activity arrived to both villages. A carpet-making factory founded by Ignaz Ginzkey (and developed by his son Willy) achieved world renown. In 1924, Ginzkey equipped the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City with the world&#x27;s largest carpet. In 1871 Franz Peukert established a company that later developed into a familiar name in butcher&#x27;s equipment. Eduard Stiassny founded porcelain production in the town in 1896.

After the discovery of a spring in 1862, the village on the left bank became involved in the spa business. In 1913, the owner of the spa, Rudolf, joined with Weber, the owner of a mineral water source discovered in 1866. Afterwards in 1918, the spa in Maffersdorf was bought by the owner of the resort in Lázně Libverda to promote competition.

In 1872, Reichenberger founded a public-owned brewery and maltworks in Maffersdorf, which became famous for its beer. The two settlements that belonged to the Bohemian governance of Liberec () had 4,910 inhabitants between them. A local railway branch line was inaugurated on the 12th of July as a part of the Liberec-Jablonec-Tanvald railway route, leading to the building of two stations - Mattersdorf and Dörfel.

In 1901 both villages were merged into one market town (population 6,234 by 1934), and Czech inhabitants started to use currently known name Vratislavice. In 1903 it obtained full status as a town, and 1918 saw the area become part of the newly founded state of Czechoslovakia.

As a part of the Sudetenland, the town was occupied and incorporated into Nazi Germany, according to the Munich Agreement, followed in 1945 by the transfer of nearly all of the almost exclusively German-speaking inhabitants of the town by the Czechoslovak government to Germany, as agreed upon by the Allies as a definite solution to the existing ethnic strife.

In 1951, the town became connected to Liberec and Jablonec by a tram project that had been proposed since 1900. In 1970, services on the tramway had been periodically discontinued due to the poor condition of the tracks. Nowadays, the streetcar route is operated by the local transportation company &quot;Dopravní podnik města Liberce&quot;.

Vratislavice was promoted to the status of town again in 1956, but in 1980 it became an administrative part of Liberec. Since 1989 there have been several attempts to renew the status of an independent town of Vratislavice.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
After the dissolution of the Communist Party rule during the Velvet Revolution, some companies found the transition into the free-market economy very difficult. The well-known brewery, &quot;Vratislav&quot; was so run down that it was forced into closure in 1998. During a two-year dormancy the company was bought by the Hols firm, and with help of many friends of Maffersdorfer beer the brewery was put back into operation in summer of 2004, trading under the name of &quot;Konrad&quot;. In 2003, the Hols brewery produced 6,500,000 litres. In October 2004, a new classic car museum was opened in the grounds of the brewery.

Vratislavice is not only notable in drinks industry as a producer of beer; Vratislavická kyselka s.r.o., owned by UNIPO a.s. of Pardubice, produce mineral water (&quot;Vratislavická kyselka&quot;) and other alcohol-free beverages.

To this day, the brewery and carpet factory are the most important industries in Vratislavice.

<doc id="240868" wikidata="Q190959" url="?curid=240868" title="Transvaal (province)">
<text>The Province of Transvaal (), commonly referred to as the Transvaal (; ), was a province of South Africa from 1910 until 1994, when a new constitution subdivided it following the end of apartheid. The name &quot;Transvaal&quot; refers to the province&#x27;s geographical location to the north of the Vaal River. Its capital was Pretoria, which was also the country&#x27;s executive capital.

==History==
In 1910, four British colonies united to form the Union of South Africa. The Transvaal Colony, which had been formed out of the bulk of the old South African Republic after the Second Boer War, became the Transvaal Province in the new union. Half a century later, in 1961, the union ceased to be part of the Commonwealth of Nations and became the Republic of South Africa. The PWV (Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging) conurbation in the Transvaal, centred on Pretoria and Johannesburg, became South Africa&#x27;s economic powerhouse, a position it still holds today as Gauteng Province.

In 1994, after the fall of apartheid, the former provinces were abolished, and the Transvaal ceased to exist. The south-central portion (including the PWV) became Gauteng, the northern portion became Limpopo and the southeastern portion became Mpumalanga. Most of the North West came from the southwestern portion of the old Transvaal, and a tiny segment of the Transvaal joined KwaZulu-Natal. 

Even before 1994, the Transvaal Province was subdivided into regions for a number of purposes (such as municipal and district courts, and sporting divisions). These divisions included Northern Transvaal (present-day Limpopo and Pretoria), Eastern Transvaal (currently Mpumalanga), Western Transvaal (currently part of North West Province) and Southern Transvaal (now Gauteng Province, but which also includes Pretoria).

== Geography ==
The Transvaal province lay between the Vaal River in the south, and the Limpopo River in the north, roughly between and S, and 25 and 32 E. To its south it bordered with the Orange Free State and Natal provinces, to its west were the Cape Province and the Bechuanaland Protectorate (later Botswana), to its north Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe), and to its east Portuguese East Africa (later Mozambique) and Swaziland. Except on the south-west, these borders were mostly well defined by natural features.

Several Bantustans were entirely inside the Transvaal: Venda, KwaNdebele, Gazankulu, KaNgwane and Lebowa. Parts of Bophuthatswana were also in the Transvaal, with other parts in Cape Province and Orange Free State.

Within the Transvaal lies the Waterberg Massif, a prominent ancient geological feature of the South African landscape.

===Regions===

* PWV region (later Gauteng province) consisting of the Witwatersrand, which in turn consists of the West Rand and the East Rand, as well as Johannesburg; the Vaal Triangle and Pretoria.
* The North West
* Limpopo
* Mpumalanga

==Districts in 1991==

Districts of the province and population at the 1991 census. 

==Administrators==
==Sports==
The province was divided into a number of sporting teams. These teams were renamed after the Transvaal became defunct, however their traditional territories have remained unchanged in many cases, even though they overlap the boundaries of the Transvaal&#x27;s successor provinces.

Examples of this include the Blue Bulls (formerly &quot;Northern Transvaal&quot;), which governs rugby in Pretoria (now part of Gauteng) and Limpopo Province, and the Golden Lions (formerly &quot;Transvaal&quot;) formed in 1889.

The Orlando Pirates Football Club was founded in 1937 and was originally based in Orlando, Soweto and Kaizer Chiefs were founded in January 1970. In the same year, Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. originated from Marabastad, a cosmopolitan area north west of the Pretoria CBD in the early 1960s.

Cricket teams from the former Transvaal include &quot;Transvaal&quot; (later Gauteng) which represented the southern parts of the province, and &quot;Northern Transvaal&quot; (later Northerns) that represents the northern parts of Gauteng, including Pretoria, as well as areas further north.

<doc id="240869" wikidata="Q1929582" url="?curid=240869" title="Mosuo">
<text>The Mosuo (; also spelled Moso, Mosso or Musuo), often incorrectly referred to as the Naxi, are an ethnic group living in China&#x27;s Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces. Consisting of a population of approximately 50,000, many of them live in the Yongning region, around Lugu Lake, in Labai, in Muli, and in Yanyuan.

Although the Mosuo are culturally distinct from the Nashi, the Chinese government places them as members of the Nashi minority. The Nashi are about 320,000 people spread throughout different provinces in China. Their culture has been documented by indigenous scholars Lamu Gatusa, Latami Dashi, Yang Lifen, and He Mei.

==Introduction==
The Mosuo are often referred to as China&#x27;s &quot;last matrilineal society&quot;. The Mosuo themselves may also often use the description &quot;matriarchal&quot;, which they believe increases interest in their culture and thus attracts tourism. However, the terms &quot;matrilineal&quot; and &quot;matriarchal&quot; do not reflect the full complexity of their social organization. In fact, it is not easy to categorize Mosuo culture within traditional anthropological categories. They have aspects of a matriarchal culture: women are often the head of the house, inheritance is through the female line, and women make business decisions. However, unlike a matriarchy, the political power tends to be in the hands of males. For instance, a man named Ge Ze A Che is the political leader of Luoshui village. However, according to an article by NPR, there was once a time when the political leaders of Mosuo villages were in fact females. The anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday has argued that the Musuo should be considered a matriarchy. Further, scholars have argued that while matrilineal arrangements are the normative pattern, domestic arrangements still vary geographically and by family circumstance.

==Lifestyle==

===Daily life===
Mosuo culture is primarily agrarian, with work based on farming tasks such as raising livestock (yak, water buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry) and growing crops, including grains and potatoes. The people are largely self-sufficient in diet, raising enough for their daily needs. Meat is an important part of their diet and, since they lack refrigeration, is preserved through salting or smoking. The Mosuo are renowned for their preserved pork, which may be kept for 10 years or more. They produce a local alcoholic beverage made from grain, called &quot;sulima&quot;, which is similar to strong wine. Sulima is drunk regularly and usually offered to guests and at ceremonies and festivals.

Local economies tend to be barter-based. However, increased interaction with the outside world brings greater use of a cash-based trade system. Average incomes are low (US$150–200 per year), causing financial restrictions when cash is needed for activities such as education or travel. Electricity has been introduced in most Mosuo communities, but some villages still lack electric power.

Mosuo homes consist of four rectangular structures arranged in a square, around a central courtyard. The first floor houses livestock, including water buffalo, horses, geese, and poultry. The main cooking, eating and visiting areas are also on the first floor. The second floor is commonly used for storage and for the bedrooms.

===Role of women===
As soon as a Mosuo girl becomes old enough, she learns the tasks that she will perform for the rest of her life. Mosuo women do all the housework, including cleaning, tending the fire, cooking, gathering firewood, feeding the livestock, and spinning and weaving. In the past, due to isolation, Mosuo women produced all their own household goods. Today, due to increased trade with surrounding villages and cities, it is easier to obtain goods. Nevertheless, some Mosuo women, especially those of older generations, know how to use looms to produce cloth goods.

===Role of men===
Mosuo men help to bring up the children of their sisters and female cousins, build houses, and are in charge of livestock and fishing, which they learn from their uncles and older male family members as soon as they are old enough. Some misleading authors claim men have no responsibility in Mosuo society — they have no jobs, rest all day, and conserve their strength for nighttime visits.

Men deal with the slaughter of livestock, in which women never participate. Slaughtered pigs, in particular, are kept whole and stored in a dry, airy place that keeps them edible for up to ten years. This is especially helpful when harsh winters make food scarce.

==Matrilineality== 
Except for the women and men who leave Mosuo society, Mosuo people usually learn who their father is through casual conversation and hints from family and neighbors. When a baby turns one year old, the mother and sister of the father will visit, bringing gifts. On major festivals, children visit their father&#x27;s house. Fathers are not responsible for disciplining nor for providing for their children. Instead, they are expected to discipline and provide for their sisters&#x27; children and to be close to their nephews&#x27; biological children. Therefore, the Mosuo people &quot;know their father but are not close to their father&quot;.

===Matriarch===
The matriarch (&quot;Ah mi,&quot; or elder female, in Chinese) is the head of the house. The &quot;Ah mi&quot; has absolute power; she decides the fate of all those living under her roof. In walking marriages, Mosuo women are responsible for much of the work done around the house and financial decisions. The matriarch also manages the money and jobs of each family member. When the &quot;Ah mi&quot; wishes to pass her duties on to the next generation, she will give this female successor the keys to the household storage, signifying the passing on of property rights and responsibility.

===History===
An important historical fact often missed in studies of the Mosuo was that their social organization has traditionally been feudal, with a small nobility controlling a larger peasant population. The Mosuo nobility practiced a &quot;parallel line of descent&quot; that encouraged cohabitation, usually within the nobility, in which the father passed his social status to his sons, while the women passed their status to their daughters. Thus, if a Mosuo commoner female married a male serf, her daughter would be another commoner, while her son would have serf status.

Chuan-Kang Shih argued that matrilineality and &quot;walking marriage&quot; (&quot;tisese&quot;) is a primary institution of family, sex and reproduction, and marriage is secondary. As Shih argues, marriage, as different from &quot;tisese&quot;, was introduced into Mosuo society through contact with other ethnic groups during the Yuan and Qing empire-building process.

===Adoption===
If there are no offspring of one sex, it is common for a child from another family to join an adoptive household. Such a child might come from a large family, or one too small to continue. Children raised in this sense are genealogically linked to their new households. They are treated as equal family members; in some instances, adopted females become the matriarchs of their adoptive families.

==Walking marriages==
One of the best known aspects of Mosuo culture is its practice of &quot;walking marriage&quot; (走婚 zǒu hūn in Chinese), although this practice remains poorly understood. Walking marriages are the most prominent form of marriage in Mosuo culture; however, it is not unheard of for women in Mosuo culture to marry outside of their culture, therefore participating in marriages other than walking marriages. In a walking marriage, both partners live under the roof of their respective extended families during the day; however, at night it is common for the man to visit and stay at the woman&#x27;s house (if given permission) until sunrise. Therefore, they do not technically live in the same household, but they are free to visit when granted permission. Children of parents in a walking marriage are raised by the brothers of the mother (maternal uncles), who take on the responsibilities of the father since he is not typically around during the daytime.

Shih (2010) offers the most sophisticated anthropological account of Mosuo practices of sexual union. &quot;All on-going sexual relationships in Mosuo culture are called &quot;walking marriages.&quot; These bonds are &quot;based on mutual affection.&quot; &quot;When a Mosuo woman or man expresses interest in a potential partner, it is the woman who may give the man permission to visit her. These visits are usually kept secret, with the man visiting the woman&#x27;s house after dark, spending the night, and returning to his own home in the morning.&quot; After the birth of the child, the man has no moral, cultural, or legal obligation to take care of the child. However, the child will be raised with adequate care and attention. The overwhelming support from the woman&#x27;s extended family allows both the man and woman to engage in sexual relations with whomever they please.

===General practice===
&quot;The Mosuo have large extended families, and several generations (great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, etc.) live together in the same house. Everyone lives in communal quarters, and there are no private bedrooms or living areas, except for women between certain ages (see the section on &quot;coming of age&quot;, below) who may have their own private rooms.&quot;

&quot;While a pairing may be long-term, the man never lives with the woman&#x27;s family, or vice versa. Mosuo men and women continue to live with and be responsible to their respective families. The couple do not share property. The father usually has little responsibility for his offspring.&quot; However, this does not mean that men can wipe their hands free of responsibilities and spend every night participating in shenanigans. After work, they are obligated to go home and help raise their nieces and nephews. The children rely on the collective effort of the extended family rather than that of the biological father.

&quot;A father may indicate an interest in the upbringing of his children by bringing gifts to the mother&#x27;s family. This gives him status within the mother&#x27;s family, while not actually making him part of the family.&quot;

===Matrilineal society===
Unlike other cultures, women in the Mosuo society dominate the household and family. They are responsible for housework, agricultural duties, and taking care of children. In a walking marriage, the ancestral line is most important on the wife&#x27;s side of the family and the children of the couple reside and belong to the wife&#x27;s family household. Considering women are responsible for most domestic jobs, they have a larger role in the walking marriage and are viewed with more respect and importance in this society.

Husbands in walking marriages have a much less involved role than wives. The husbands in these relationships are generally the figures who are in charge of all religious and political decisions for the family. Regarding the family responsibilities, the father or husband in the family does not have nearly as many responsibilities regarding the family as the wife does. In fact, the male relatives of the mother&#x27;s side of the family, such as uncles and cousins, are generally the &quot;father figure&quot; to the husband&#x27;s children. The mother&#x27;s brothers occupy a central role in the household. Their roles include disciplining children, caring for them, and supporting the children financially. Since the husband and wife live with their separate immediate families, they help take care of the families&#x27; children and issues regarding their household. Even though fathers are involved in their sister&#x27;s children&#x27;s lives, they are not necessarily involved in their biological children&#x27;s life. In walking marriages, the involvement of a father in his child&#x27;s life is optional. If a father decides to be involved in the upbringing of his own biological child, he can bring gifts and help with work around the woman&#x27;s household. This relationship can be performed regardless if the woman and man are still in the walking marriage and it gives the man a type of &quot;official status&quot; among the family without being fully involved.

===Advantages to a walking marriage===
Other than the child receiving exceptional care and attention from the extended family, there are many inconspicuous advantages for participating in a walking marriage. For example: divorce is never an issue because the man and woman are not legally bound together, thus sharing very few of the same responsibilities. There are also never any disputes over who owns custody of the child since the child belongs to the mother&#x27;s extended family and takes the mother&#x27;s last name. In the case of a parent&#x27;s death, the child still has a prodigious amount of care and affection from the extended family.

===Myths and controversies===
Outsiders often believe the following myths:

====Mosuo women have many partners====
&quot;While it is possible for a Mosuo woman to change partners as often as she likes, few Mosuo women have more than one partner at a time. Anthropologists call this system &#x27;serial monogamy.&#x27; Most Mosuo form long-term relationships and do not change partners frequently. Some of these pairings may even last a lifetime.&quot;

But, in other anthropologists&#x27; views, it is a more recent change, &quot;in the face of political campaigns and cultural integration with the Han Chinese&quot;, and &quot;previous generations often continued with multiple partners even after a child was born. Some older Na report having upwards of 30, 40, even 50 partners throughout their lifetime&quot; and despite these changes, &quot;notions of exclusivity are not entrenched, and the Na language has no word for &#x27;jealousy&#x27;.&quot;

====Fathers of children are commonly not known====
The large majority of women know their children&#x27;s fathers; it is actually a source of embarrassment if a mother cannot identify a child&#x27;s father. But, &quot;unlike many cultures which castigate mothers and children without clear paternity, Na children induce no such censure&quot;. The father of a child born from a walking marriage will not see his child during the day, but rather at night time. The father doesn&#x27;t play as large a role in the development of the child. &quot;At a child&#x27;s birth, the father, his mother and sisters come to celebrate, and bring gifts. On New Year&#x27;s Day, a child visits the father to pay respect to him and his household. A father also participates in the coming-of-age ceremony. Though he does not have an everyday role, the father is nevertheless an important partner.&quot;

==Customs==
===Coming of age===
The coming-of-age ceremony, which occurs at the age of thirteen, is one of the most important events in a Mosuo child&#x27;s life. Before this ceremony, Mosuo children all dress the same and are restricted from certain aspects of Mosuo life, particularly those that involve religious rites. Also, a child who dies before this ceremony does not receive the traditional funeral. Once they come of age, girls are given their skirts, and boys are given their trousers (thus, it is called the &quot;skirt ceremony&quot; for girls, and the &quot;trouser ceremony&quot; for boys).

After coming of age, Mosuo females can get their own private bedroom, called a &quot;flowering room&quot;; and, once past puberty, can begin to invite partners for &quot;walking marriages&quot;.

===Hearth===
This is the center of the household. It combines the worship of nature, ancestors, and spirits. Behind the hearth is a slab of stone (called &quot;guo zhuang&quot; in Chinese) and an ancestral altar where Mosuo household members leave a food offering. They do this before each meal, even when having tea.

===Funeral===
Death is the domain of men, who make all funeral arrangements. It is the only time men prepare food for family and guests. Usually, every family in the village will send at least one male to help with the preparations. Dabas and Lamas are invited to recite prayers for the deceased. Mosuo believe that if a spirit does not have assistance of a Daba, it will be lost. Without Lamas, a spirit will not be able to attain reincarnation. Caskets are small and square, with the deceased&#x27;s body placed in the fetal position so that it can be reborn in the next life. During cremation, a decorated horse is led around the fire, which Mosuo believe will help carry the deceased&#x27;s spirit away. Afterwards, friends and family gather to pay their last respects and wish the deceased an easy journey to their ancestral land.

===Dogs===
While some Asian cultures practice the custom of eating dogs, this is strictly forbidden to the Mosuo. In Mosuo culture, a myth describes that long ago, dogs had life spans of 60 years while humans had life spans of thirteen years. Humans felt their life span was too short, so they traded it with the dogs in exchange for paying homage to them. Therefore, dogs are valued members of the family. They are never killed, and they most certainly are never eaten. During the initiation rites into adulthood, Mosuo adolescents pray before the family dogs.

==Religion==
Religion is a major part of Mosuo life. It is made up of two coexisting beliefs: their own syncretic faith called Daba and the influence of Tibetan Buddhism.

===Daba===
Daba has been a part of Mosuo culture for thousands of years, handed down through generations by word of mouth. It functions as a repository of most of the Mosuo culture and history. It is based on animistic principles and involves ancestor worship and the worship of a mother goddess: &quot;The Mosuo are alone among their neighbors to have a guardian mother goddess rather than a patron warrior god&quot;.

The primary tasks of the priest (or shaman), also called &quot;daba&quot;, are to perform exorcisms and assist deceased spirits. Priests drink alcohol until they go into a trance and can converse with these spirits. Since the Mosuo have no written language, there is no religious script, nor is there a temple. All Daba priests are male, and they live in their mother&#x27;s house with their brothers and sisters. When not pursuing their religious duties, they engage in everyday tasks such as fishing and herding.

On a day-to-day basis, Daba plays a far smaller role in the lives of the Mosuo. The daba is mostly called on to perform traditional ceremonies at key events, such as naming a child, a child&#x27;s coming-of-age ceremony, a funeral, or special events such as the Spring Festival. The daba is also called on to perform specific rites if someone is sick.

A cultural crisis is emerging. Due to past Chinese government policies, which made being a Daba priest illegal (this policy has now ceased), there are very few remaining dabas, most of whom are old men. This leads some Mosuo to worry that Mosuo history and heritage may be lost when the current generation of Dabas are gone.

===Buddhism===
Buddhism has started to play a larger role in their culture in recent years. Today Tibetan-style Buddhism is the predominant religion, but it has been somewhat adapted to Mosuo society. Like the Buddhist population of Tibet, both lay and monastic Buddhists among the Mosuo eat meat. Mosuo lamas offer prayers of thanks and prayers for the dead, offer basic religious and secular education to young children, and counsel adults. In families with more than one male child, one will most often be sent to be a monk.

The Mosuo even have their own &quot;living Buddha&quot;, a man said to be a reincarnation of one of the great Tibetan spiritual leaders. He usually lives in Lijiang, but returns to the main Tibetan temple in Yongning for important spiritual holidays. Many Mosuo families will send at least one male to be trained as a monk, and in recent years, the number of such monks has increased quite significantly. The current Mosuo Living Buddha died of old age in April 2011. 

In most Mosuo homes, a statue of some Buddhist deity can be found above the cooking fire; the family will usually put a small portion of whatever they are cooking in the fire, as an offering to their deity. Tibetan Buddhist holidays and festivals are participated in by the entire Mosuo community.

==Economy==
The Mosuo are primarily farmers. Subsistence is mostly based on agriculture. Farmers work &quot;seven hours a day and seven months a year&quot;. In the past, they cultivated oats, buckwheat, and flax exclusively. This changed under Han influence at the end of the nineteenth century. Since then, these farmers have also cultivated, among other things, corn, sunflowers, soybeans, potatoes and other vegetables such as pumpkins and beans. Potatoes were their main staple for a while until the mid-twentieth century when they began growing rice, which today makes up more than half of annual production. In recent years, subsistence for some Mosuo has shifted dramatically from agriculture due to a thriving tourist industry

Mosuo also keep a variety of livestock. Since the early twentieth century they have raised buffalo, cows, horses, and goats which originated from Han and Tibetan regions. However, their preferred stock is pigs. Pork plays several important roles in Mosuo society. It is fed to guests, is the obligatory offering at funerals, and used as payment or reimbursement. Hua (2001) insists that it is &quot;a kind of currency and... a symbol of wealth&quot;.

Once a year, regions of Mosuo males gather for a livestock fair. They travel for miles on buses, horses, or foot to attend. Here men sell and trade livestock to supplement household incomes.

The Mosuo fish on Lake Lugu and also set land-based fish traps; however, they do not use motorboats, and catching fish in open water using their very primitive gear is not easy.

==Language==
The Mosuo speak Na (a.k.a. Narua), a Naish language (closely related to Naxi), a member of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Although there is no question that the language of the Mosuo and that of the Naxi are closely related, some Mosuo speakers resent the use of the language name Naxi, which is commonly used to refer to the dialect of the town of Lijiang and the surrounding villages. A more adequate name is Na, used in several linguistic publications. The name &quot;Narua&quot; is used in the Summer Institute of Linguistics&#x27; inventory of languages, Ethnologue. Narua A collection of audio recordings is available online, and a trilingual glossary has also been posted online. Two book-length descriptions of the language are available, as well as several research articles.

Yongning Na, which is spoken in Yongning township, Lijiang municipality, Yunnan, China, has been documented by Jacques and Michaud (2011).

==Script==
Like other Chinese, the Mosuo today use Han script for daily communication. The Tibetan script may sometimes be used for religious purposes.

The Mosuo also have their own native religion, called Daba, which uses 32 symbols. &quot;They follow a &quot;primal&quot; belief system. However, the head ritual specialists of the Daba religion, who are called daba, have advanced beyond the stage of spirit-possessed shamans, and also are in possession of a number of sacred texts. Therefore, these practitioners should be categorized as a type of priest.&quot; However, there are currently efforts underway to develop a written form of the Mosuo language.

==Intercultural exchanges==
The Han are the ethnic majority of China, one of the 56 ethnic groups of China. In the Yongning region during the Ming Dynasty, the Mosuo integrated many Han ideals. The Mosuo also accepted Buddhism and adapted it to fit their values. Neither the Cultural Revolution nor trade between different cultures fundamentally changed Mosuo beliefs. But recently, Mosuo society has been rapidly changing.

===Modernity===
With improved technology, there are better roads and transportation. Young Mosuo men and women use these modes to leave their villages and find employment in neighboring cities. Television has brought the ideas of the modern world and an image of a more affluent lifestyle. Also, men have begun to take jobs independent of the household and earn their own income. Older Mosuo fear emerging property conflicts as a consequence. Care for the family, with younger children generations leaving the villages, is also a concern.

===Tourism===
Mosuo living near Lugu Lake inhabit an aesthetically pleasing region. Photographers, television crews, writers, and artists are drawn to their homes. This increased attention has also brought tourists. Tourism is primarily domestic and typically occurs as a part of organized tour groups to view a culture that seems &quot;exotic&quot;. Tourism has influenced kinship and parenting practices, with Mosuo residing in areas where tourism is prevalent being less likely to adhere to strict matrilineal norms.

==Films==
There are many documentaries made about the Mosuo, in English and Mandarin, and there has even been a film festival dedicated to some of them. Most films perpetuate the myth that women run the society, some even claiming that men have no say in political or household matters and do not work.
