==Biography==
===Early life and stand-up comedy===
Thomas James Kenny was born in Syracuse, New York, on July 13, 1962, and was raised there. His parents were Theresa (&quot;née&quot; Donigan) and Paul Kenny. As a young child, in the late 1960s and the 1970s, he loved drawing and collecting record albums. Kenny met Bobcat Goldthwait in first grade and they became lifelong friends. In their mid-teens, they saw an ad for an open-mic night at Skaneateles that featured comedian Barry Crimmins with the moniker &quot;Bear Cat&quot;. He and Goldthwait went to the event, and performed under the monikers Tomcat and Bobcat, respectively, as a tribute to Crimmins, after which Goldthwait used Bobcat as his stage name. Describing Kenny&#x27;s stand-up routines, Goldthwait said, &quot;Tom would get up there and talk about his therapist and he didn&#x27;t even have a therapist, he just loved Woody Allen.&quot;

Kenny went to Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School, a Catholic high school. After college, he performed stand-up comedy around the country for about eight years before he moved on to other venues.

===Television and film career===
Kenny has acted in many films and TV shows, debuting in &quot;How I Got into College&quot; (1989) and later appeared in films such as &quot;Shakes the Clown&quot; (1991) and &quot;Comic Book: The Movie&quot; (2004). On television, he would host the &quot;Music News&quot; segments of &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot; in the early 1990s. He appeared in sketch comedy shows &quot;The Edge&quot; which aired on Fox from 1992 to 1993, and &quot;Mr. Show&quot; which aired on HBO from 1995 to 1998, both roles in the show were as a regular cast member. He appears in the live-action segments of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; as Patchy the Pirate, appeared on &quot;R. L. Stine&#x27;s The Haunting Hour: The Series&quot; on the season four episode, &quot;Uncle Howee&quot; as Uncle Howee, a high-energy kids&#x27; show host with strange powers.

===Voice acting===
Kenny said that he voices &quot;a lot of sweet yellow characters for some reason.&quot; He described SpongeBob&#x27;s voice as in between that of a child and an adult, stating &quot;Think a Stan Laurel, Jerry Lewis kind of child-man. Kind of like a Munchkin but not quite, kind of like a kid, but not in a Charlie Brown child&#x27;s voice on the TV shows.&quot;

Joe Murray auditioned Kenny for voice acting roles for &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; in a casting call in Los Angeles, California. On one occasion, the producers required Kenny to fill the role of Charlie Adler, who was absent. He voices Cupid for the Nickelodeon show &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;.

Joe Murray chose Kenny for several roles on another of his projects, &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot; as Scoutmaster Lumpus and Slinkman, because Murray, after seeing Kenny&#x27;s previous work for &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, felt that Kenny &quot;adds writing to his roles&quot; and &quot;brings so much&quot;.

He voiced Dog in &quot;CatDog&quot;, as well as the voice of Cliff. He voices many characters in &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, including the Mayor, the Narrator, Mitch Mitchelson, Snake and Little Arturo from the Gangreen Gang, Rainbow the Clown, etc. He voiced Eduardo and various other characters in &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home For Imaginary Friends&quot;, Dr. Two-Brains in the PBS Kids show, &quot;WordGirl&quot;, and the villains Knightbrace, the Common Cold and Mr. Wink in &quot;&quot;.

He voiced the character Squanchy on &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;.
He plays a number of roles in the &quot;Transformers Animated&quot; TV show. A few of the characters he voices in this series are Starscream and his clones, Isaac Sumdac and Waspinator. Kenny also voiced several characters on the animated show &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot;, as well as the Autobots Skids and Wheelie in the live-action &quot;Transformers&quot; film series. On &quot;Dilbert&quot;, Kenny voiced Ratbert, Asok, Dilbert&#x27;s shower, and some minor characters. He played Mr. Hal Gibson in the animated kids show &quot;Super Robot Monkey Team Hyper Force GO!&quot;.

In 2009, Kenny became a regular cast voice in the Fox comedy series &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot;. He voices Muhammad Sabeeh &quot;Happy&quot; Fa-ach Nuabar, the secretive custodian who is plotting a terrorist attack, as well as Happy&#x27;s interpreter. The series premiered on April 19, 2009. Kenan Thompson, Kristin Chenoweth, Jason Bateman, Nick Kroll, Cheri Oteri, Henry Winkler, Will Arnett, and Will Forte are the other main cast members.

He plays the Ice King and Magic Man on &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. In 2011, Kenny took over the role of Rabbit from Ken Sansom in &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;. From 2012 to 2014, Kenny voiced Woody Johnson on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Brickleberry&quot;. He voiced various characters in the Cartoon Network programme &quot;Mixels&quot;, Sumo in the Cartoon Network programme &quot;Clarence&quot;, Daddo in &quot;Henry Hugglemonster&quot;, Dr. Otto Octavius on &quot;The Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, and Leo Callisto in &quot;Miles from Tomorrowland&quot;.

He has also provided voices in television advertisements for Best Buy (as an elf for a Christmas spot), Experian (as a talking modem alongside DC Douglas), and Talking Hank in the YouTube web series &quot;Talking Tom and Friends&quot;.

In video games, Kenny is best known as the voice of Spyro the Dragon, having replaced previous voice actor Carlos Alazraqui. He first voiced Spyro in &quot;Spyro 2: Ripto&#x27;s Rage!&quot;, and continued to voice the character up until &quot;&quot;, where he was replaced by Jess Harnell. He also voiced another character in the series, Sgt. James Byrd, in &quot;&quot;. He reprised both roles in &quot;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&quot;, a collection of modern remakes of the original Spyro trilogy. He also voiced Crash Bandicoot live at E3 1997, switching out performances with Carlos Alazraqui.

Kenny was a guest star on HarmonQuest as both himself and his &quot;in-game character&quot; Legnahcra the maître d&#x27; of Virtuous Harmony.

He also voiced Fethry Duck in the 2017 version of &quot;DuckTales&quot;. In 2022, he voiced Benito Mussolini and other characters in Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Pinocchio.

Kenny reprised his role as Ice King in the 2023 spinoff series &quot;Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake&quot;.

====&quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;====
While working on the animated series &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, Kenny met marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. After the cancellation of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; in 1996, Hillenburg began developing his own concept for an ocean-themed series, building off of his background in marine science. Hillenburg said that he wanted to base the show on his favorite animal, the sea sponge, &quot;because it&#x27;s a funny animal, a strange one.&quot; To voice this character, Hillenburg approached Kenny in 1997.

The series, titled &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, premiered on Nickelodeon on May 1, 1999. It soon became a commercial success. Kenny plays various other characters on the show, including the live-action character Patchy the Pirate and the voices of Gary the Snail, the French Narrator (a parody of Jacques Cousteau), and SpongeBob&#x27;s father (Harold SquarePants). In 2010, Kenny received the Annie Award for &quot;Voice Acting in a Television Production&quot; for his role as SpongeBob in &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Truth or Square&quot; (season 6, episode 23–24). He also voiced SpongeBob in the sequel film released on February 6, 2015. In 2018 and 2020, he received the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program.

The television show celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2019. In celebration, a television special was aired, titled &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Big Birthday Blowout&quot;. One scene includes each of the show&#x27;s main characters&#x27; voice actors portraying live-action versions of their characters. While not the first &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot; episode that blended animated sequences with live-action characters, this the first time that the characters&#x27; voice actors have all played a live-action scene all together. The airing was recognized as honoring the show&#x27;s creator Stephen Hillenburg, who had died one year earlier.

Later in 2019, he was featured in the live recording of the Broadway musical &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; playing the role of Patchy the Pirate.

Super Bowl LVIII, which took place in 2024, was broadcast on CBS; the network&#x27;s parent company Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, the network that airs &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot;. As part of a plan to maximize the use of its broadcasting rights partnership with the National Football League (NFL), Paramount decided to air an &quot;alternative&quot; Super Bowl telecast on Nickelodeon that was aimed to be more family-friendly. The channel&#x27;s website claimed that the broadcast was intended for &quot;kids of all ages, from 2 to 102&quot;. The broadcast on Nickelodeon was hosted by Nate Burleson and Noah Eagle in live-action and accompanying them were Spongebob and Patrick. Tom Kenny and Patrick&#x27;s voice actor Bill Fagerbakke voiced the characters in real-time, improvising their own jokes in-character, and also utilized motion capture. Kenny commented that the Nickelodeon airing allowed viewers who weren&#x27;t football fans to still engage with the game.

==Personal life==
Kenny first met his wife Jill Talley in 1992 while working on &quot;The Edge&quot;. The two have collaborated on many productions together, including &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (in which Talley voices Karen Plankton). They also both appeared in the music video for &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; by The Smashing Pumpkins. They have two children, Mack (b. 1997) and Nora (b. 2003). The Kennys live in Studio City, California.

<doc id="253556" wikidata="Q5903506" url="?curid=253556" title="Horizon effect">
<text>The horizon effect, also known as the horizon problem, is a problem in artificial intelligence whereby, in many games, the number of possible states or positions is immense and computers can only feasibly search a small portion of them, typically a few plies down the game tree. Thus, for a computer searching only a fixed number of plies, there is a possibility that it will make a poor long-term move. The drawbacks of the move are not &quot;visible&quot; because the computer does not search to the depth at which its evaluation function reveals the true evaluation of the line. The analogy is to peering at a distance on a sphere like the earth, but a threat being beneath the horizon and hence unseen.

When evaluating a large game tree using techniques such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning, search depth is limited for feasibility reasons. However, evaluating a partial tree may give a misleading result. When a significant change exists just over the horizon of the search depth, the computational device falls victim to the horizon effect.

In 1973 Hans Berliner named this phenomenon, which he and other researchers had observed, the &quot;Horizon Effect.&quot; He split the effect into two: the Negative Horizon Effect &quot;results in creating diversions which ineffectively delay an unavoidable consequence or make an unachievable one appear achievable.&quot; For the &quot;largely overlooked&quot; Positive Horizon Effect, &quot;the program grabs much too soon at a consequence that can be imposed on an opponent at leisure, frequently in a more effective form.&quot;

The horizon effect can be somewhat mitigated by quiescence search. This technique extends the effort and time spent searching board states left in volatile positions and allocates less effort to easier-to-assess board states. For example, &quot;scoring&quot; the worth of a chess position often involves a material value count, but this count is misleading if there are hanging pieces or an imminent checkmate. A board state after the white queen has captured a protected black knight would appear to the naive material count to be advantageous to white as they are now up a knight, but is probably disastrous as the queen will be taken in the exchange one ply later. A quiescence search may tell a search algorithm to play out the captures and checks before scoring leaf nodes with volatile positions.

== Examples ==
In chess, assume a situation where the computer only searches the game tree to six plies and from the current position determines that the queen is lost in the sixth ply; and suppose there is a move in the search depth where it may sacrifice a rook, and the loss of the queen is pushed to the eighth ply. This is, of course, a worse move than sacrificing the queen because it leads to losing both a queen and a rook. However, because the loss of the queen was pushed over the horizon of search, it is not discovered and evaluated by the search. Losing the rook seems to be better than losing the queen, so the sacrifice is returned as the best option whereas delaying the sacrifice of the queen has in fact additionally weakened the computer&#x27;s position. As another example, while some perpetual checks quickly trigger a threefold-repetition draw, others can involve a queen chasing a king around across the board, varying the position each time, meaning the actual forced draw could be many moves into the future. If a quiescence search playing out the checks isn&#x27;t done, then the AI might not detect the possibility, and can let the engine blunder a winning position into a drawn one.

In Go, the horizon effect is a major concern for writing an AI capable of even beginner-level play, and part of why alpha-beta search was a weak approach to Computer Go compared to later machine learning and pattern recognition approaches. It is a very common situation for certain stones to be &quot;dead&quot; yet require many moves to actually capture them if fought over. The horizon effect may cause a naive algorithm to incorrectly assess the situation and believe that the stones are savable by calculating a play that seems to keep the doomed stones alive as of the move the search tree stops at. While the death of the group can indeed be delayed, it cannot be stopped, and contesting this will only allow more stones to be captured. A classic example that beginners learn are Go ladders, but the same general idea occurs even in situations that aren&#x27;t strictly ladders.

<doc id="253558" wikidata="Q1193229" url="?curid=253558" title="Fear and Trembling">
<text>Fear and Trembling (original Danish title: &quot;Frygt og Bæven&quot;) is a philosophical work by Søren Kierkegaard, published in 1843 under the pseudonym &quot;Johannes de silentio&quot; (Latin for &quot;John of the Silence&quot;). The title is a reference to a line from Philippians 2:12, which says to “continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.” The Philippians verse is sometimes thought to reference Psalm 55:5, which says, “Fear and trembling came upon me.”

The work is an extended meditation on Genesis 22, also known as the binding of Isaac. Silentio attempts to understand Abraham’s internal psychological state during his three-and-a-half-day journey to Moriah. The text attempts to demonstrate how it is not easy to understand Abraham’s actions through ethical categories like Sittlichkeit or the universal. Instead, Silentio posits that Abraham can only be understood through a new category called faith.

&quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; speaks of many of Kierkegaard’s most well-known concepts, such as the absurd, knight of faith, single individual, teleological suspension of the ethical, three stages, tragic hero, and so on.

== Structure ==
One of the work’s core themes is that attempting to understand Abraham through rational ethical thinking (Silentio mentions Greek philosophy and Hegel) leads to the reductio ad absurdum conclusion that &quot;(a)&quot; there must be something that transcends this type of thinking or &quot;(b)&quot; there is no such thing as “faith,” which would mean Abraham’s characterization as the “father of the faith” is mistaken. Silentio also emphasizes that Abraham believes that Isaac will survive the ordeal and is not simply giving up the latter for dead; this distinction comes out in what Silentio respectively refers to as faith and infinite resignation.

Silentio first presents four alternate Abrahams—different ways Abraham might have approached and carried out the command to sacrifice Isaac—in the “Exordium” of the text, who, although they are prepared to follow God’s command to sacrifice Isaac, are nevertheless considered to be without faith. Silentio then engages in extended praise of Abraham’s qualities and recounts much of the latter’s life up to and including the binding in the “Eulogy on Abraham.” Finally, the “Preliminary Expectoration” introduces the concepts of faith and infinite resignation.

The three problems Silentio engages are three thought experiments or setups that attempt to demonstrate how Abraham’s actions and internal state correspond to the religious category of faith and thereby transcend ethics. They are

* Problema I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?
* Problema II: Is there an Absolute Duty to God?
* Problema III: Was It Ethically Defensible for Abraham to Conceal His Undertaking from Sarah, from Eliezer, and from Isaac?

=== Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical? ===
Source:

Silentio identifies the ethical with the universal, which he defines as that which is incumbent upon all people at all times. Sin is when an individual asserts himself as an individual over and against the universal. Silentio asserts that faith is a paradox whereby an individual transcends the universal without sinning. Silentio explains that Abraham must occupy the category of faith, because without doing so, he would not be the father of the faith.

Silentio explains that Abraham’s relationship to God during the binding cannot be logically understood or mediated away. He contrasts Abraham with three other figures—Agamemnon, Jephthah, and Brutus—who similarly had to sacrifice or impose capital punishment on their offspring but are nevertheless called “tragic heroes,” not knights of faith.

Silentio explains that tragic heroes have a middle term that acts as their telos, or purpose, when transgressing the ethical; that is, in transgressing against the ethical, they do so for a higher, yet understandable ethical purpose. Silentio asserts that Abraham inhabits the paradox of faith because he does not act for any purpose other than his own, and Silentio further identifies Abraham’s purpose with God’s purpose.

=== Is there an Absolute Duty to God? ===
Source:

Problem 2 continues in the same vein as problem 1. Silentio asserts that, in faith, the individual determines their relationship with the universal (i.e., the ethical) through their relationship with God instead of the other way around (i.e., determining their relationship with God through the ethical).

Silentio asserts that knights of faith exist in pure isolation and cannot explain themselves or their actions to others. If a knight of faith were to express themselves in terms of the universal, this would constitute “temptation” (&quot;Anfechtung&quot;), and the individual would sin since their actions now breach or offend against universal injunctions. Faith is then an incommunicable paradox known only to the individual in question and to God.

=== Was It Ethically Defensible for Abraham to Conceal His Undertaking from Sarah, from Eliezer, and from Isaac? ===
Source:

Silentio identifies the ethical with the universal and the universal with the disclosed (i.e., that which is spoken about, revealed, or confessed). He explains that Abraham cannot be acting in accordance with the universal because he obeys God’s command silently without explaining the purpose of his journey to his wife, his servants, or Isaac.

Problem 3 is the longest of the text and introduces the categories of the aesthetic and the demonic. Silentio claims that aesthetics rewards hiddenness while the ethical demands disclosure. Silentio then postulates that faith mimics aesthetics in its hiddenness but that it is ultimately a distinct category.

A series of folkloric myths and tales are analyzed to explain how the dynamics of concealment and disclosure of information in these stories interact with the categories of the aesthetic, ethical, and religious, and how these tensions are resolved through serendipity, self-sacrifice, or the absurd.

Ultimately, Silentio persists in portraying Abraham’s isolation and incommunicability. He explains that the tragic hero’s sacrifice is usually mediated by some kind of cultural background or disclosure that contextualizes his actions but that Abraham possesses no such security.

== Regine ==

It is sometimes thought that &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; was Kierkegaard’s way of explaining or working through his breaking off of his engagement with Regine since the text is said to contain a hidden message.

== Reception ==

Just as Genesis 22 has inspired much commentary over the years, so, too, has &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; inspired much analysis. One commentator argues that the text is an analogy for how Christian justification by faith shortcuts rational meditation or universal reasoning. Another commentator argues that the content of Abraham’s faith is eschatological in the sense that Abraham consigns both the optimal aesthetic and ethical outcomes of the ordeal away from his own ability (infinite resignation) while nevertheless hoping in their absurd fulfillment through the help of God (faith).

Kierkegaard foresaw the immense posthumous popularity of &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; and predicted that it would be translated into many different languages.

<doc id="253559" wikidata="Q2255450" url="?curid=253559" title="Progressive chess">
<text>Progressive chess is a chess variant in which players, rather than just making one move per turn, play progressively longer series of moves. The game starts with White making one move, then Black makes two consecutive moves, White replies with three, Black makes four and so on. Progressive chess can be combined with other variants; for example, when Circe chess is played as a game, it is usually progressively. Progressive chess is considered particularly apt for playing correspondence chess using mail or some other slow medium, because of the relatively small number of moves in a typical game.
== Rules ==
There are two main varieties of progressive chess: Italian progressive chess and Scottish progressive chess (otherwise known as &quot;Scotch chess&quot;). The two have the following rules in common:

*A check must be escaped from on the first move of a series—if this cannot be done, it is checkmate and the game is lost.
*&quot;En passant&quot; captures of pawns are allowed if the pawn in question moved two squares in one move, but no further, at some point during the last turn, but the capture must be made on the first move of a series.
*If 10 consecutive turns are played with no captures and no pawn moves, then the game is declared a draw unless one of the players can force a checkmate (this is the progressive chess equivalent of the fifty-move rule in orthodox chess).
*If, during their turn, a player has no legal moves but is not in check, the game is a draw by &quot;progressive stalemate&quot;. (In particular it is possible to save a draw by stalemating oneself.)

Italian and Scottish progressive chess are distinguished by rules on when a player is allowed to give check:

* Scottish progressive chess: check may be given on any move of a series, but a check ends the series—all further moves that would otherwise be allowed are forfeited. This has no effect on the next series: the other player will receive the normal number of moves. (For example, if Black on move six checks immediately, then the second through sixth moves are forfeited; but White will still be able to play seven moves on the next turn.)
* Italian progressive chess: a check may only be given on the last move of a full series (for example, on move six, a check can only be given on the sixth move)—giving a check at any other point in a series is illegal. In particular, if the only way to escape a check is to give check on the first move of the series, then the game is lost by the player in check by &quot;progressive checkmate&quot;.

In practice, the difference between the Scottish and Italian rules is not often relevant. John Beasley examined 416 mating positions that either occurred or could have occurred in games played by the Italian rules; of them 158 were such &quot;progressive checkmates&quot; (Beasley calls them &quot;Italian mates&quot;). In all but two cases (Cassano–Dipilato 1986 and Boniface– Archer 1993), there would have been a mate next turn under the Scottish rules as well; and in Boniface–Archer 1993, White could have given a Scottish mate on his last turn rather than an Italian mate, leaving only one case where the difference in rules would actually have affected the result. (And even in Cassano–Dipilato 1986, Black did not see that he could have given an Italian mate, and the play that followed – ending in a draw – was the best available under Scottish rules, according to Beasley.)

Progressive chess, like orthodox chess, is notated with algebraic notation. However, the numbering of moves is handled slightly differently. Rather than one White and one Black move being given under each move number (leading to notation in orthodox chess like 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6), each turn by each player is given its own move number (leading to notation in progressive chess like 1.e4 2.e5 Nf6 3.Bc4 Qh5 Qxf7#). In this way, the move number is equal to the number of moves in a series available to a player on that turn.

== Other variations ==
There is another form of progressive chess, English progressive chess, which makes quite a significant change to the rules: within each turn, no piece may be moved twice until every other piece which has a legal move has moved once; no piece may move three times until every other piece which can has moved twice; and so on. These restrictions do not carry over from one turn to the next—so the opening 1.e4 2.e6 f6 3.e5 Nf3 Bc4 is legal (White&#x27;s e-pawn may move again because its moves are on different turns), but the sequence 1.e4 2.e6 f6 3.e5 Ba6 Bxb7 is not (the bishop has made two moves, but there are many other white pieces which have not moved on that turn). There is no &quot;en passant&quot; capture under English rules, and rules on checks follow the Scottish rules.

Progressive Take-All uses the same rules as Progressive chess, but involves capturing all pieces of your opponent&#x27;s instead of checkmate. Pawns can also be promoted to Kings.

In Logical progressive chess (by Paul Byway, &quot;Variant Chess&quot; 18, automne 1995) there&#x27;s no castling or pawn two advance (hence no en-passant capture) since these rules were added to speed up the game, which is not relevant in progressive form.

<text>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) is the generic term of two different American labor unions, representing writers in film, television, radio, and online media: 
* The Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE), headquartered in New York City and affiliated with the AFL-CIO national trade union center
* The Writers Guild of America West (WGAW), headquartered in Los Angeles but unaffiliated.

Although both organizations operate independently, they perform some common activities, including negotiating contracts and launching strike actions in unison.

==Background and founding==

Both organizations of the Writers Guild of America were established by 1954 after the merging of groups from other writers labor unions. The Authors Guild (AG) was originally founded in 1912 as the Authors&#x27; League of America (ALA) to represent book and magazine authors, as well as dramatists. In 1921, the Dramatists Guild of America split off as a separate group to represent writers of stage and, later, radio drama. That same year, the Screen Writers Guild (SWG) was formed to represent film screenwriters, but operated primarily more as a social organization until 1933 when the group affiliated with the AG and took on a more active role in labor negotiations. With the emergence of the television industry by 1948, the SWG and a Television Writers Group within the AG began to represent TV writers. In recognition of the growing complexity of representing members in many different fields of entertainment writing, the unions reorganized in 1954. Both the Authors Guild and the Dramatists Guild would continue to represent writers in print media, the SWG would fold, and those working in motion pictures, TV, and radio would be represented by two new guilds, headquartered on both coasts: the WGAE and the WGAW.

==Common activities==
Although the WGAE and the WGAW run independently of each other, they jointly perform some regular activities, including the following:

* The Writers Guild of America Awards are presented annually by both guilds in recognition of excellence in film, television, and radio writing, including both fiction and non-fiction. The 1st Writers Guild of America Awards were held in 1949 to honor the best film writers of 1948. The annual awards show includes simultaneous presentations on both coasts.
* The WGA screenwriting credit system is used to determine who receives credit for writing a film, television, theatrical, or other media work written under the WGA&#x27;s jurisdiction. The guilds are the final arbiters on who and how writers are listed in the credits.
* The WGA script registration service is run by both guilds to establish the date of creation of literary property.
* Both guilds are members of the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds.

==Strikes==
The WGAE and WGAW negotiate contracts in unison as well as launch strike actions simultaneously.

* The 1960 Writers Guild of America strike lasted for 22 weeks. The negotiated contract included the first residuals for theatrical films, and the improved pensions.
* The 1981 Writers Guild of America strike lasted for 13 weeks. The negotiated contract included establishing payment terms for &quot;pay TV&quot; cable programs.
* The 1985 Writers Guild of America strike lasted two weeks. At dispute was the formula for paying home video residuals.
* The 1988 Writers Guild of America strike lasted from March 7 to August 7, 1988. Among the disputes were residuals from syndicated reruns of hour-long shows.
* The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike lasted from November 5, 2007, to February 12, 2008. Among the disputes were residuals from content made for new media and programs on DVD. The production of several television shows were affected by the strike.
* The 2023 Writers Guild of America strike lasted from May 2 to September 27, 2023. Among the disputes were residuals from the use of AI and streaming media.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter/1235404087&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many productions were impacted by the strike.

<doc id="253564" wikidata="Q4871616" url="?curid=253564" title="Battle of Lumphanan">
<text>The Battle of Lumphanan was fought on 15 August 1057, between Macbeth, King of Scots, and the future King Malcolm III. Macbeth would die from wounds sustained in the battle, which came after his defeat at the battle of Dunsinane in 1054. According to tradition, the battle took place at Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire. Macbeth&#x27;s Stone, a large boulder at the site, is said to mark the spot where Macbeth was mortally wounded. Following the battle, Lulach - Macbeth&#x27;s stepson - was crowned King, before being killed by Malcolm who then took the throne.

==Background==
Since the death of his father, King Duncan, in battle with Macbeth, Malcolm had been sheltered by Earl Siward of Northumbria, his uncle. It was with Siward&#x27;s backing that Malcolm first attacked Macbeth leading to the battle of Dunsinane in 1054, where Malcolm failed to win the crown, but had his own lands restored to him. Some sources say it was Edward the Confessor, King of England, who ordered Siward to launch this invasion of Scotland.

==The battle==
After retreating North, Macbeth would again face Malcolm in battle at Lumphanan, in modern day Aberdeenshire. The battle itself appears to have been a comparatively minor affair, except for Macbeth being mortally wounded and later dying. Sources describe the battle as taking place &quot;in a wood&quot;.

Macbeth&#x27;s Stone, a large boulder at the site, is traditionally held to mark the location where Macbeth was wounded.

==Aftermath==
Following the death of Macbeth, his stepson Lulach was initially crowned king. 18 weeks later, in 1058 Malcolm killed him by &#x27;treachery&#x27; at Essie, near Aberdeen. Upon assuming the throne, Malcolm, with the help of his English queen, Margaret, began the long task of removing Gaelic culture from mainstream Scotland.

<doc id="253568" wikidata="Q1660345" url="?curid=253568" title="Implied volatility">
<text>In financial mathematics, the implied volatility (IV) of an option contract is that value of the volatility of the underlying instrument which, when input in an option pricing model (usually Black–Scholes), will return a theoretical value equal to the price of the option. A non-option financial instrument that has embedded optionality, such as an interest rate cap, can also have an implied volatility. Implied volatility, a forward-looking and subjective measure, differs from historical volatility because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a security. To understand where implied volatility stands in terms of the underlying, implied volatility rank is used to understand its implied volatility from a one-year high and low IV. 

==Motivation==
An option pricing model, such as Black–Scholes, uses a variety of inputs to derive a theoretical value for an option. Inputs to pricing models vary depending on the type of option being priced and the pricing model used. However, in general, the value of an option depends on an estimate of the future realized price volatility, σ, of the underlying. Or, mathematically:

:formula_1

where &quot;C&quot; is the theoretical value of an option, and &quot;f&quot; is a pricing model that depends on σ, along with other inputs.

The function &quot;f&quot; is monotonically increasing in σ, meaning that a higher value for volatility results in a higher theoretical value of the option. Conversely, by the inverse function theorem, there can be at most one value for σ that, when applied as an input to formula_2, will result in a particular value for &quot;C&quot;.

Put in other terms, assume that there is some inverse function &quot;g&quot; = &quot;f&quot;−1, such that

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the market price for an option. The value formula_5 is the volatility implied by the market price formula_4, or the implied volatility.

In general, it is not possible to give a closed form formula for implied volatility in terms of call price (for a review see ). However, in some cases (large strike, low strike, short expiry, large expiry) it is possible to give an asymptotic expansion of implied volatility in terms of call price. A different approach based on closed form approximations has been also investigated. 

===Example===
A European call option, formula_7, on one share of non-dividend-paying XYZ Corp with a strike price of $50 expires in 32 days. The risk-free interest rate is 5%. XYZ stock is currently trading at $51.25 and the current market price of formula_7 is $2.00. Using a standard Black–Scholes pricing model, the volatility implied by the market price formula_7 is 18.7%, or:

:formula_10

To verify, we apply implied volatility to the pricing model, &quot;f ,&quot; and generate a theoretical value of $2.0004:

:formula_11

which confirms our computation of the market implied volatility.

==Solving the inverse pricing model function==
In general, a pricing model function, &quot;f&quot;, does not have a closed-form solution for its inverse, &quot;g&quot;. Instead, a root finding technique is often used to solve the equation:

:formula_12

While there are many techniques for finding roots, two of the most commonly used are Newton&#x27;s method and Brent&#x27;s method. Because options prices can move very quickly, it is often important to use the most efficient method when calculating implied volatilities.

Newton&#x27;s method provides rapid convergence; however, it requires the first partial derivative of the option&#x27;s theoretical value with respect to volatility; i.e., formula_13, which is also known as &quot;vega&quot; (see The Greeks). If the pricing model function yields a closed-form solution for &quot;vega&quot;, which is the case for Black–Scholes model, then Newton&#x27;s method can be more efficient. However, for most practical pricing models, such as a binomial model, this is not the case and &quot;vega&quot; must be derived numerically. When forced to solve for &quot;vega&quot; numerically, one can use the Christopher and Salkin method or, for more accurate calculation of out-of-the-money implied volatilities, one can use the Corrado-Miller model.

Specifically in the case of the Black[-Scholes-Merton] model, Jaeckel&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Rational&quot; method computes the implied volatility to full attainable (standard 64 bit floating point) machine precision for all possible input values in sub-microsecond time. The algorithm comprises an initial guess based on matched asymptotic expansions, plus (always exactly) two Householder improvement steps (of convergence order 4), making this a three-step (i.e., non-iterative) procedure. A reference implementation in C++ is freely available.
Besides the above mentioned root finding techniques, there are also methods that approximate the multivariate inverse function directly. Often they are based on polynomials or rational functions.

For the Bachelier (&quot;normal&quot;, as opposed to &quot;lognormal&quot;) model, Jaeckel published a fully analytic and comparatively simple two-stage formula that gives full attainable (standard 64 bit floating point) machine precision for all possible input values.

==Implied volatility parametrisation==
With the arrival of big data and data science, parametrising the implied volatility has taken central importance for the sake of coherent interpolation and extrapolation purposes. The classic models are the SABR and SVI model with their IVP extension.

==Implied volatility as measure of relative value==
As stated by Brian Byrne, the implied volatility of an option is a more useful measure of the option&#x27;s relative value than its price. The reason is that the price of an option depends most directly on the price of its underlying asset. If an option is held as part of a delta neutral portfolio (that is, a portfolio that is hedged against small moves in the underlying&#x27;s price), then the next most important factor in determining the value of the option will be its implied volatility.

Implied volatility is so important that options are often quoted in terms of volatility rather than price, particularly among professional traders.

===Example===
A call option is trading at $1.50 with the underlying trading at $42.05. The implied volatility of the option is determined to be 18.0%. A short time later, the option is trading at $2.10 with the underlying at $43.34, yielding an implied volatility of 17.2%. Even though the option&#x27;s price is higher at the second measurement, it is still considered cheaper based on volatility. 
The reason is that the underlying needed to hedge the call option can be sold for a higher price.

==As a price==
Another way to look at implied volatility is to think of it as a price, not as a measure of future stock moves.
In this view, it simply is a more convenient way to communicate option prices than currency. Prices are different in nature from statistical quantities: one can estimate volatility of future underlying returns using any of a large number of estimation methods; however, the number one gets is not a price. A price requires two counterparties, a buyer, and a seller. Prices are determined by supply and demand. Statistical estimates depend on the time-series and the mathematical structure of the model used. 
It is a mistake to confuse a price, which implies a transaction, with the result of a statistical estimation, which is merely what comes out of a calculation. Implied volatilities are prices: they have been derived from actual transactions. Seen in this light, it should not be surprising that implied volatilities might not conform to what a particular statistical model would predict.

However, the above view ignores the fact that the values of implied volatilities depend on the model used to calculate them: different models applied to the same market option prices will produce different implied volatilities. Thus, if one adopts this view of implied volatility as a price, then one also has to concede that there is no unique implied-volatility-price and that a buyer and a seller in the same transaction might be trading at different &quot;prices&quot;.

==Non-constant implied volatility==
In general, options based on the same underlying but with different strike values and expiration times will yield different implied volatilities. This can be viewed as evidence that an underlying&#x27;s volatility is not constant but instead depends on factors such as price level or time, or it can be viewed as evidence that the underlying&#x27;s price changes do not follow the distribution that is assumed in the model under consideration (such as Black-Scholes). There exist few known parametrisation of the volatility surface (Schonbusher, SVI, and gSVI) as well as their de-arbitraging methodologies. See stochastic volatility and volatility smile for more information.

==Volatility instruments==
Volatility instruments are financial instruments that track the value of implied volatility of other derivative securities. For instance, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from a weighted average of implied volatilities of various options on the S&amp;P 500 Index. There are also other commonly referenced volatility indices such as the VXN index (Nasdaq 100 index futures volatility measure), the QQV (QQQ volatility measure), IVX – Implied Volatility Index (an expected stock volatility over a future period for any of US securities and exchange-traded instruments), as well as options and futures derivatives based directly on these volatility indices themselves.

<text>Dino Dini (born 5 June 1965) is an Italian-British video game developer and creator of the &quot;Kick Off&quot; series of football games. He was a lecturer at the NHTV Breda University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, teaching game programming.

==Career==
In 1989 Dini&#x27;s football game &quot;Kick Off&quot; was published by Anil Gupta&#x27;s publishing house Anco Software, for the Atari ST &amp; Amiga to critical acclaim and high sales. Dini followed it with &quot;Player Manager&quot; and &quot;Kick Off 2&quot;. &quot;Goal!&quot; (also known as &quot;Dino Dini&#x27;s Soccer&quot;) was then released after Dini left Anco and moved to Virgin Games in 1993. &quot;Goal!&quot; was critically acclaimed worldwide. &quot;Goal!&quot; introduced more user friendly controls compared to &quot;Kick Off 2&quot; and entertained a wider audience than its predecessor. In 1996, Dini moved to the United States to work as project director for the Z-Axis football game &quot;Three Lions&quot;, released in 1998.

In 2001, Dini moved back to Great Britain and started to work with his new development company, Abundant Software. In 2004, Dini signed with DC Studios to develop a new soccer game which was code-named &quot;Soccer 3&quot; and later &quot;Total Control Football&quot;. The game was cancelled during the summer of 2005.

After 2005, Dini worked as a contractor on a government-funded project. In 2009, he became a lecturer for the International Game Architecture and Design programme at NHTV Breda University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands, teaching game programming. At the 2009 Game Developers Conference Europe (GDCE) in Cologne, Germany, Dini was guest speaker on the subject of video game design.

In 2010, Dino ran unsuccessfully for a position on the International Game Developers Association board of directors. In August of that year, he announced via his blog that he was working on a sequel to his game &quot;Player Manager&quot; as an independent project. In 2011 he contributed articles and the beta version of his browser-based game &quot;Letteroids 3D&quot; to DevilsMMO, a website for MMO and MMORPG games.

A new game of &quot;Kick Off&quot; series, titled &quot;Dino Dini&#x27;s Kick Off Revival&quot;, was released on the PlayStation 4 in June 2016, with poor reviews from game journalists, and from players. Metacritic judged &quot;Kick Off Revival&quot; the 2nd worst game of 2016. &quot;Vice&quot; elected &quot;Revival&quot; as the worst football game ever made. A PlayStation Vita version was delayed and released nine months later in March 2017 with bad reviews.

The PC version, released on Steam in September 2017, was an exact port of the PlayStation 4 version. Whilst maintaining an overall &quot;mixed&quot; summary status, it has similarly received bad reviews for being a basic game missing many features of the original &quot;Kick Off&quot; games.

<doc id="253571" wikidata="Q2296321" url="?curid=253571" title="Gylfi">
<text>In Norse mythology, Gylfi (Old Norse: ), &quot;Gylfe&quot;, &quot;Gylvi&quot;, or &quot;Gylve&quot; was the earliest recorded king of Sviþjoð, Sweden, in Scandinavia. He is known by the name Gangleri when appearing in disguise. The Danish tradition on Gylfi tells how he was tricked by Gefjon and her sons from Jötunheim, who were able to shapeshift into tremendous oxen.

==The creation of Zealand==
The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; section of Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and the Eddic poem &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot; tell a legend of how Gylfi was seduced by the goddess Gefjon to give her as much land as she could plow in one night. Gefjon transformed her four sons into oxen and took enough land to create the Danish island of Zealand, leaving the Swedish lake Vänern.

==Meeting the Æsir==
&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; tell how the supposedly historic (non-deified version) Odin and his people the Æsir and Vanir, who later became the Swedes, obtained new land where they built the settlement of Old Sigtuna. In Snorri&#x27;s account Gylfi is supposedly deluded by the Æsir into accepting their religion; hence the name &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, most often interpreted as the &quot;deluding of Gylfi&quot;, although &#x27;-ginning&#x27; is regarded the same as what we recognise in &quot;beginning&quot;, thus &quot;the origin of Gylfi&quot; is also possible. Gylfi and the remaining older bronze-age inhabitants of the land then supposedly adopted the religion of the Æsir and began to live under their rule. Snorri presents an outline of Norse mythology through a dialogue between Gylfi and three rulers of the Æsir.

It is possible that Snorri&#x27;s account is based on an old tradition tracing particular beliefs or foundations of particular Norse cults to this legendary Gylfi. However, it is much more likely that the historic King Gylfi was simply already a follower of the ancient Norse religion and, as such, could easily have passed on these beliefs or stories.

==Other appearances==
In one version of &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, king Gylfi married his daughter Heiðr to Sigrlami, the king of Garðaríki (Russia). Heiðr and Sigrlami had the son Svafrlami, who forced the two dwarves Dvalin and Durin to forge the magic sword Tyrfing.

A Gylfi is attested in the lineage of sea-kings in Hversu Noregr byggðist, a saga sketching out an origin myth of Norway, where he appears as the brother of Glamma, eponymous of the longest river in Norway, now spelled Glomma, sons of Geitir, apparently one of four sons of Gor the brother of Nór, eponymous first king of Nórway. The connection with Glamma is interesting regarding how Gylfi is attested in Ynglinga saga particularly connecting him to the longest river system in Scandinavia, now carrying four different names beginning as Femund river and Trysil river in Norway, then Klarälven in Sweden, above the rather big lake Vänern into which it drains, central to the story of Gefjon in Ynglinga saga, and finally Göta älv that drains lake Vänern into the Kattegat, at the city of Gothenburg, on the western coast of Sweden. Hversu Noregr byggðist is loaded with eponymous tales to such an extent that to not connect this Gylfi with this river system would be kind of ignorant. One will find some common sources of the drainage-system forming the signified rivers in the Mountain-region of Norway, turning into Rena River as a tributary to Glomma, and Femund River, as a tributary to Kläraälven. The lake Korssjøen which drains to the east into the Femund River and the drainage system reaching the sea by Gothenburg in Sweden, and the lake Narsjøen that drains to the north into Nørå River and Glomma running south, reaching the sea close to Fredrikstad by the Oslofjord.

<doc id="253575" wikidata="Q160135" url="?curid=253575" title="Majdanek concentration camp">
<text>Majdanek (or Lublin) was a Nazi concentration and extermination camp built and operated by the SS on the outskirts of the city of Lublin during the German occupation of Poland in World War II. It had seven gas chambers, two wooden gallows, and some 227 structures in all, placing it among the largest of Nazi concentration camps. Although initially intended for forced labor rather than extermination, it was used to murder people on an industrial scale during Operation Reinhard, the German plan to murder all Polish Jews within their own occupied homeland. In operation from 1 October 1941 to 22 July 1944, it was captured nearly intact. The rapid advance of the Soviet Red Army during Operation Bagration prevented the SS from destroying most of its infrastructure, and Deputy Camp Commandant Anton Thernes failed to remove the most incriminating evidence of war crimes.

The camp was nicknamed Majdanek (&quot;little Majdan&quot;) in 1941 by local residents, as it was adjacent to the Lublin ghetto of Majdan Tatarski. Nazi documents initially described the site as a POW camp of the Waffen-SS, based on how it was funded and operated. It was renamed by the Reich Security Main Office as &quot;Konzentrationslager Lublin&quot; on April 9, 1943, but the local Polish name remained more popular.

After the camp&#x27;s liberation in July 1944, the site was formally protected by the Soviet Union. By autumn, with the war still raging, it had been preserved as a museum. The crematorium ovens and gas chambers were largely intact, serving as some of the best examples of the genocidal policy of Nazi Germany. The site was given national designation in 1965. Today, the Majdanek State Museum is a Holocaust memorial museum and education centre devoted entirely to the memory of atrocities committed in the network of concentration, slave-labor, and extermination camps and sub-camps of &quot;KL Lublin.&quot; It houses a permanent collection of rare artifacts, archival photographs, and testimony.

==History==
===Construction===

&quot;Konzentrationslager Lublin&quot; was established in October 1941 on the orders of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, forwarded to Odilo Globocnik soon after Himmler&#x27;s visit to Lublin on 17–20 July 1941 in the course of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The original plan drafted by Himmler was for the camp to hold at least 25,000 POWs.&lt;ref name=&quot;majdanek.eu/2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After large numbers of Soviet prisoners-of-war were captured during the Battle of Kiev, the projected camp capacity was subsequently increased to 50,000. Construction for that many began on October 1, 1941 (as it did also in Auschwitz-Birkenau, which had received the same order). In early November, the plans were extended to allow for 125,000 inmates and in December to 150,000. It was further increased in March 1942 to allow for 250,000 Soviet prisoners of war.

Construction began with 150 Jewish forced laborers from one of Globocnik&#x27;s Lublin camps, to which the prisoners returned each night. Later the workforce included 2,000 Red Army POWs, who had to survive extreme conditions, including sleeping out in the open. By mid-November, only 500 of them were still alive, of whom at least 30% were incapable of further labor. In mid-December, barracks for 20,000 were ready when a typhus epidemic broke out, and by January 1942 all the slave laborers – POWs as well as Polish Jews – were dead. All work ceased until March 1942, when new prisoners arrived. Although the camp did eventually have the capacity to hold approximately 50,000 prisoners, it did not grow significantly beyond that size.

===Operation===


In July 1942, Himmler visited Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka, the three secret extermination camps built specifically for Operation Reinhard to eliminate Polish Jewry. These camps had begun operations in March, May, and July 1942, respectively. Subsequently, Himmler issued an order that the deportations of Jews to the camps from the five districts of occupied Poland, which constituted the Nazi &quot;Generalgouvernement&quot;, be completed by the end of 1942.

Majdanek was made into a secondary sorting and storage depot at the onset of Operation Reinhard, for property and valuables taken from the victims at the killing centers in Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka. Due to large Jewish populations in southeastern Poland, including the ghettos at Kraków, Lwów, Zamość and Warsaw, which were not yet &quot;processed&quot;, Majdanek was refurbished as a killing center around March 1942. The gassing was performed in plain view of other inmates, without as much as a fence around the buildings. Another frequent murder method was shootings by the squads of Trawnikis. According to the Majdanek Museum, the gas chambers began operation in September 1942.
There are two identical buildings at Majdanek where Zyklon B was used. Executions were carried out in barrack 41 with crystalline hydrogen cyanide released by the Zyklon B. The same poison gas pellets were used to disinfect prisoner clothing in barrack 42.

Due to the pressing need for foreign manpower in the war industry, Jewish laborers from Poland were originally spared. For a time they were either kept in the ghettos, such as the one in Warsaw (which became a concentration camp after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising), or sent to labor camps such as Majdanek, where they worked primarily at the Steyr-Daimler-Puch weapons/munitions factory.

By mid-October 1942, the camp held 9,519 registered prisoners, of whom 7,468 (or 78.45%) were Jews, and another 1,884 (19.79%) were non-Jewish Poles. By August 1943, there were 16,206 prisoners in the main camp, of which 9,105 (56.18%) were Jews and 3,893 (24.02%) were non-Jewish Poles. Minority contingents included Belarusians, Ukrainians, Russians, Germans, Austrians, Slovenes, Italians, and French and Dutch nationals. According to the data from the official Majdanek State Museum, 300,000 people were inmates of the camp at one time or another. The prisoner population at any given time was much lower.

From October 1942 onward Majdanek also had female overseers. These SS guards, trained at the Ravensbrück concentration camp, included Elsa Ehrich, Hermine Boettcher-Brueckner, Hermine Braunsteiner, Hildegard Lächert, Rosy Suess (Süss), Elisabeth Knoblich-Ernst, Charlotte Karla Mayer-Woellert, and Gertrud Heise (1942–1944), who were later convicted as war criminals.

Majdanek did not initially have subcamps. These were incorporated in early autumn 1943 when the remaining forced labor camps around Lublin, including Budzyn, Trawniki, Poniatowa, Krasnik, Pulawy, as well as the &quot;Airstrip&quot; (&quot;Airfield&quot;), and &quot;Lipowa 7&quot;) concentration camps became sub-camps of Majdanek.

From 1 September 1941 to 28 May 1942, Alfons Bentele headed the Administration in the camp. Alois Kurz, SS Untersturmführer, was a German staff member at Majdanek, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and at Mittelbau-Dora. He was not charged. On 18 June 1943, Fritz Ritterbusch moved to KL Lublin to become aide-de-camp to the Commandant.

Due to the camp&#x27;s proximity to Lublin, prisoners were able to communicate with the outside world through letters smuggled out by civilian workers who entered the camp. Many of these surviving letters have been donated by their recipients to the camp museum. In 2008 the museum held a special exhibition displaying a selection of those letters.

From February 1943 onward, the Germans allowed the Polish Red Cross and Central Welfare Council to bring in food items to the camp. Prisoners could receive food packages addressed to them by name via the Polish Red Cross. The Majdanek Museum archives document 10,300 such itemized deliveries.

===Cremation facilities===

Until June 1942, the bodies of those murdered at Majdanek were buried in mass graves (these were later exhumed and burned by the prisoners assigned to &quot;Sonderkommando 1005&quot;).

From June 1942, the SS disposed of the bodies by burning them, either on pyres made from the chassis of old lorries or in a crematorium. The so-called &quot;First Crematorium&quot; had two ovens which were brought to Majdanek from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. This facility stood in &quot;Interfield I&quot;, the area between the first and the second fenced camp section; it is no longer in existence today.

In autumn of 1943, the first crematorium at Majdanek was replaced by the &quot;New Crematorium&quot;. It was a T-shaped wooden building with five ovens, fueled with coke and built by the Heinrich Kori GmbH of Berlin. The building was set on fire by the Germans on 22 July 1944 as they abandoned the camp on the day that the Red Army entered the outskirts of Lublin. The crematorium building which stands on the site today is a reconstruction from the time when the former camp became a memorial. Its ovens are the original ones built in 1943.

===&quot;Aktion Erntefest&quot;===
Operation Reinhard continued until early November 1943, when the last Jewish prisoners of the Majdanek system of subcamps from the District Lublin in the General Government were massacred by the firing squads of Trawniki men during Operation &quot;Harvest Festival&quot;. With respect to the main camp at Majdanek, the most notorious executions occurred on November 3, 1943, when 18,400 Jews were murdered in a single day. The next morning, 25 Jews who had succeeded in hiding were found and shot. Meanwhile, 611 other prisoners, 311 women and 300 men, were commanded to sort through the clothes of the dead and cover the burial trenches. The men were later assigned to &quot;Sonderkommando 1005&quot;, where they had to exhume the same bodies for cremation. These men were then executed. The 311 women were subsequently sent to Auschwitz, where they were murdered by gas. By the end of &quot;Aktion Erntefest&quot; (&quot;Harvest Festival&quot;), Majdanek had only 71 Jews left out of the total number of 6,562 prisoners still alive.
Executions of the remaining prisoners continued at Majdanek in the following months. Between December 1943 and March 1944, Majdanek received approximately 18,000 so-called &quot;invalids&quot;, many of whom were subsequently murdered with Zyklon B. Executions by firing squad continued as well, with 600 shot on January 21, 1944; 180 shot on January 23, 1944; and 200 shot on March 24, 1944.

Adjutant Karl Höcker&#x27;s postwar trial documented his culpability in mass murders committed at this camp: On 3 May 1989 a district court in the German city of Bielefeld sentenced Höcker to four years imprisonment for his involvement in gassing to death prisoners, primarily Polish Jews, in the concentration camp Majdanek in Poland. Camp records showed that between May 1943 and May 1944 Höcker had acquired at least of Zyklon B poisonous gas for use in Majdanek from the Hamburg firm of Tesch &amp; Stabenow. In addition, Commandant Rudolf Höss of Auschwitz wrote in his memoirs, while awaiting trial in Poland, that one method of murder used at Majdanek (KZ Lublin) was Zyklon B.

===Evacuation===
In late July 1944, with Soviet forces rapidly approaching Lublin, the Germans hastily evacuated the camp and partially destroyed the crematoria before Soviet Red Army troops arrived on July 24, 1944. Majdanek is the best-preserved camp of the Holocaust due to incompetence by its deputy commander, Anton Thernes. It was the first major concentration camp liberated by Allied forces, and the horrors found there were widely publicised.

Although 1,000 inmates had previously been forcibly marched to Auschwitz (of whom only half arrived alive), the Red Army still found thousands of inmates, mainly POWs, still in the camp, and ample evidence of the mass murder that had occurred there.

==Victims==
The official estimate of 78,000 victims, of those 59,000 Jews, was determined in 2005 by , director of the Research Department of the Majdanek State Museum, calculated following the discovery of the Höfle Telegram in 2000. That number is close to the one currently indicated on the museum&#x27;s website. The total number of victims has been a controversial since the research of Judge Zdzisław Łukaszkiewicz in 1948, who approximated a figure of 360,000 victims. It was followed by an estimate of around 235,000 victims by Czesław Rajca (1992) of the Majdanek Museum, which was cited by the museum for years. The current figure is considered &quot;incredibly low&quot; by Rajca, nevertheless, it has been accepted by the Museum Board of Directors &quot;with a certain caution&quot;, pending further research into the number of prisoners who were not entered into the Holocaust train records by German camp administration. For now, the museum states that based on new research, some 150,000 prisoners arrived at Majdanek during the 34 months of its existence. Of the more than two million Jews murdered in the course of Operation Reinhard, some 60,000 (56,000 known by name) were most certainly killed at Majdanek, amongst its almost 80,000 counted victims.

The Soviets initially grossly overestimated the number of murders, claiming at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946 that there were no fewer than 400,000 Jewish victims, and the official Soviet count was of 1.5 million victims of different nationalities, Independent Canadian journalist Raymond Arthur Davies, based in Moscow and on the payroll of the Canadian Jewish Congress, visited Majdanek on August 28, 1944. The following day he sent a telegram to Saul Hayes, the executive director of the Canadian Jewish Congress. It states: &quot;I do wish [to] stress that Majdanek where one million Jews and half a million others [were] killed&quot; and &quot;You can tell America that at least three million [Polish] Jews [were] killed of whom at least a third were killed in Majdanek&quot;, and though widely reported in this way, the estimate was never taken seriously by scholars.

In 1961, Raul Hilberg estimated that 50,000 Jewish victims were murdered in the camp. In 1992, Czesław Rajca gave his own estimate of 235,000; it was displayed at the camp museum. The 2005 research by the Head of Scientific Department at Majdanek Museum, historian Tomasz Kranz indicated that there were 79,000 victims, 59,000 of them Jews.

The differences between the estimates stem from different methods used and the amounts of evidence available to the researchers. The Soviet figures relied on the crudest methodology, used for Auschwitz estimates also—it assumed that the number of victims more or less corresponded to the crematoria capacity. Later researchers tried to take much more evidence into account, using records of deportations, contemporaneous population censuses, and recovered Nazi records. Hilberg&#x27;s 1961 estimate, using these records, aligns closely with Kranz&#x27;s report.

==Aftermath==

After the camp takeover, in August 1944 the Soviets protected the camp area and convened a special Polish-Soviet commission, to investigate and document the crimes against humanity committed at Majdanek. This effort constitutes one of the first attempts to document the Nazi war crimes in Eastern Europe. In the fall of 1944 the
Majdanek State Museum was founded on the grounds of the Majdanek concentration camp. In 1947 the actual camp became the monument of martyrology by the decree of Polish Parliament. In the same year, some 1,300 m3 of surface soil mixed with human ashes and fragments of bones was collected and turned into a large mound. Majdanek became a national museum in 1965.
Some Nazi personnel of the camp were prosecuted immediately after the war, and some in the decades afterward. In November and December 1944, four SS Men and two kapos were placed on trial; one committed suicide and the rest were hanged on December 3, 1944. The last major, widely publicized prosecution of 16 SS members from Majdanek (&quot;Majdanek-Prozess&quot; in German) took place from 1975 to 1981 in West Germany. Of 1,037 SS members who worked at Majdanek and are known by name, 170 were prosecuted, due to a rule applied by the West German justice system allowing only those directly involved in the process to be charged with murder.

===Soviet NKVD use===
After the capture of the camp by the Soviet Army, the NKVD retained the ready-made facility as a prison for soldiers of the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (AK, the Home Army resistance) loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile and the &quot;Narodowe Siły Zbrojne&quot; (National Armed Forces) opposed to both German and Soviet occupation. The NKVD like the SS before them used the same facilities to imprison and torture Polish patriots.

On August 19, 1944, in a report to the Polish government-in-exile, the Lublin District of the Home Army (AK) wrote: &quot;Mass arrests of the AK soldiers are being carried out by the NKVD all over the region. These arrests are tolerated by the Polish Committee of National Liberation, and AK soldiers are incarcerated in the Majdanek Camp. Losses of our nation and the Home Army are equal to the losses which we suffered during the German occupation. We are paying with our blood.&quot;

Among the prisoners at the Majdanek NKVD Camp were Volhynian members of the AK, and soldiers of the AK units which had been moving toward Warsaw to join in the Warsaw Uprising. On August 23, 1944, some 250 inmates from Majdanek were transported to the rail station Lublin Tatary. There, all victims were placed in cattle cars and taken to camps in Siberia and other parts of the Soviet Union.

==Commemoration==

In July 1969, on the 25th anniversary of its liberation, a large monument designed by Wiktor Tołkin (a.k.a. Victor Tolkin) was constructed at the site. It consists of two parts: a large gate monument at the camp&#x27;s entrance and a large mausoleum holding ashes of the victims at its opposite end.

In October 2005, in cooperation with the Majdanek museum, four Majdanek survivors returned to the site and enabled archaeologists to find some 50 objects which had been buried by inmates, including watches, earrings, and wedding rings. According to the documentary film &quot;Buried Prayers&quot;, this was the largest reported recovery of valuables in a death camp to date. Interviews between government historians and Jewish survivors were not frequent before 2005.

The camp today occupies about half of its original , and—but for the former buildings—is mostly bare. A fire in August 2010 destroyed one of the wooden buildings that was being used as a museum to house seven thousand pairs of prisoners&#x27; shoes. The city of Lublin has tripled in size since the end of World War II, and even the main camp is today within the boundaries of the city of Lublin. It is clearly visible to many inhabitants of the city&#x27;s high-rises, a fact that many visitors remark upon. The gardens of houses and flats border on and overlook the camp.

In 2016, Majdanek State Museum and its branches, Sobibór and Bełżec, had about 210,000 visitors. This was an increase of 10,000 visitors from the previous year. Visitors include Jews, Poles, and others that wish to learn more about the harsh crimes against humanity.

<text>In finance, moneyness is the relative position of the current price (or future price) of an underlying asset (e.g., a stock) with respect to the strike price of a derivative, most commonly a call option or a put option. Moneyness is firstly a three-fold classification: 
* If the derivative would have positive intrinsic value if it were to expire today, it is said to be in the money (ITM);
* If the derivative would be worthless if expiring with the underlying at its current price, it is said to be out of the money (OTM);
* And if the current underlying price and strike price are equal, the derivative is said to be at the money (ATM). 
There are two slightly different definitions, according to whether one uses the current price (spot) or future price (forward), specified as &quot;at the money spot&quot; or &quot;at the money forward&quot;, etc.

This rough classification can be quantified by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money or out of the money with respect to the strike – or, conversely, how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset. This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the &quot;relative&quot; volatility surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. The most basic of these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the reciprocal, depending on convention. A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike, and is equal to the auxiliary &quot;N&quot;(&quot;d&quot;2) term in the Black–Scholes formula. This can also be measured in standard deviations, measuring how far above or below the strike price the current price is, in terms of volatility; this quantity is given by &quot;d&quot;2. (Standard deviations refer to the price fluctuations of the underlying instrument, not of the option itself.) Another measure closely related to moneyness is the Delta of a call or put option. There are other proxies for moneyness, with convention depending on market.

==Example==
Suppose the current stock price of IBM is $100. A call or put option with a strike of $100 is at-the-money. A call with a strike of $80 is in-the-money (100 − 80 = 20 &gt; 0). A put option with a strike at $80 is out-of-the-money (80 − 100 = −20 &lt; 0). Conversely, a call option with a $120 strike is out-of-the-money and a put option with a $120 strike is in-the-money.

The above is a traditional way of defining ITM, OTM and ATM, but some new authors find the comparison of strike price with current market price meaningless and recommend the use of Forward Reference Rate instead of Current Market Price. For example, a put option will be in the money if the strike price of the option is greater than the Forward Reference Rate.

==Intrinsic value and time value==
The intrinsic value (or &quot;monetary value&quot;) of an option is its value assuming it were exercised immediately. Thus if the current (spot) price of the underlying security (or commodity etc.) is above the agreed (strike) price, a call has positive intrinsic value (and is called &quot;in the money&quot;), while a put has zero intrinsic value (and is &quot;out of the money&quot;).

The time value of an option is the total value of the option, less the intrinsic value. It partly arises from the uncertainty of future price movements of the underlying. A component of the time value also arises from the unwinding of the discount rate between now and the expiry date. In the case of a European option, the option cannot be exercised before the expiry date, so it is possible for the time value to be negative; for an American option if the time value is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.

==Moneyness terms==

===At the money===
An option is at the money (ATM) if the strike price is the same as the current spot price of the underlying security. An at-the-money option has no intrinsic value, only time value.

For example, with an &quot;at the money&quot; call stock option, the current share price and strike price are the same. Exercising the option will not earn the seller a profit, but any move upward in stock price will give the option value.

Since an option will rarely be exactly at the money, except for when it is written (when one may buy or sell an ATM option), one may speak informally of an option being near the money or close to the money. Similarly, given standardized options (at a fixed set of strikes, say every $1), one can speak of which one is nearest the money; &quot;near the money&quot; may narrowly refer specifically to the nearest the money strike. Conversely, one may speak informally of an option being far from the money.

===In the money===
An in the money (ITM) option has positive intrinsic value as well as time value. A call option is in the money when the strike price is below the spot price. A put option is in the money when the strike price is above the spot price.

With an &quot;in the money&quot; call stock option, the current share price is greater than the strike price so exercising the option will give the owner of that option a profit. That will be equal to the market price of the share, minus the option strike price, times the number of shares granted by the option (minus any commission).

===Out of the money===
An out of the money (OTM) option has no intrinsic value. A call option is out of the money when the strike price is above the spot price of the underlying security. A put option is out of the money when the strike price is below the spot price.

With an &quot;out of the money&quot; call stock option, the current share price is less than the strike price so there is no reason to exercise the option. The owner can sell the option, or wait and hope the price changes.

==Spot versus forward==

Assets can have a forward price (a price for delivery in future) as well as a spot price. One can also talk about moneyness with respect to the forward price: thus one talks about ATMF, &quot;ATM Forward&quot;, and so forth. For instance, if the spot price for USD/JPY is 120, and the forward price one year hence is 110, then a call struck at 110 is ATMF but not ATM.

==Use==
Buying an ITM option is effectively lending money in the amount of the intrinsic value. Further, an ITM call can be replicated by entering a forward and buying an OTM put (and conversely). Consequently, ATM and OTM options are the main traded ones.

==Definition==

===Moneyness function===
Intuitively speaking, moneyness and time to expiry form a two-dimensional coordinate system for valuing options (either in currency (dollar) value or in implied volatility), and changing from spot (or forward, or strike) to moneyness is a change of variables. Thus a moneyness function is a function &quot;M&quot; with input the spot price (or forward, or strike) and output a real number, which is called the moneyness. The condition of being a change of variables is that this function is monotone (either increasing for all inputs, or decreasing for all inputs), and the function can depend on the other parameters of the Black–Scholes model, notably time to expiry, interest rates, and implied volatility (concretely the ATM implied volatility), yielding a function:
:formula_1
where &quot;S&quot; is the spot price of the underlying, &quot;K&quot; is the strike price, &quot;τ&quot; is the time to expiry, &quot;r&quot; is the risk-free rate, and &quot;σ&quot; is the implied volatility. The forward price &quot;F&quot; can be computed from the spot price &quot;S&quot; and the risk-free rate &quot;r.&quot; All of these are observables except for the implied volatility, which can computed from the observable price using the Black–Scholes formula.

In order for this function to reflect moneyness – i.e., for moneyness to increase as spot and strike move relative to each other – it must be monotone in both spot &quot;S&quot; and in strike &quot;K&quot; (equivalently forward &quot;F,&quot; which is monotone in &quot;S&quot;), with at least one of these strictly monotone, and have opposite direction: either increasing in &quot;S&quot; and decreasing in &quot;K&quot; (call moneyness) or decreasing in &quot;S&quot; and increasing in &quot;K&quot; (put moneyness). Somewhat different formalizations are possible. Further axioms may also be added to define a &quot;valid&quot; moneyness.

This definition is abstract and notationally heavy; in practice relatively simple and concrete moneyness functions are used, and arguments to the function are suppressed for clarity.

===Conventions===
When quantifying moneyness, it is computed as a single number with respect to spot (or forward) and strike, without specifying a reference option. There are thus two conventions, depending on direction: call moneyness, where moneyness increases if spot increases relative to strike, and put moneyness, where moneyness increases if spot decreases relative to strike. These can be switched by changing sign, possibly with a shift or scale factor (e.g., the probability that a put with strike &quot;K&quot; expires ITM is one minus the probability that a call with strike &quot;K&quot; expires ITM, as these are complementary events). Switching spot and strike also switches these conventions, and spot and strike are often complementary in formulas for moneyness, but need not be. Which convention is used depends on the purpose. The sequel uses &quot;call&quot; moneyness – as spot increases, moneyness increases – and is the same direction as using call Delta as moneyness.

While moneyness is a function of both spot and strike, usually one of these is fixed, and the other varies. Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; this is useful in option pricing and understanding the Black–Scholes formula. Conversely, given market data at a given point in time, the spot is fixed at the current market price, while different options have different strikes, and hence different moneyness; this is useful in constructing an implied volatility surface, or more simply plotting a volatility smile.

===Simple examples===
This section outlines moneyness measures from simple but less useful to more complex but more useful. Simpler measures of moneyness can be computed immediately from observable market data without any theoretical assumptions, while more complex measures use the implied volatility, and thus the Black–Scholes model.

The simplest (put) moneyness is fixed-strike moneyness, where &quot;M&quot;=&quot;K,&quot; and the simplest call moneyness is fixed-spot moneyness, where &quot;M&quot;=&quot;S.&quot; These are also known as absolute moneyness, and correspond to not changing coordinates, instead using the raw prices as measures of moneyness; the corresponding volatility surface, with coordinates &quot;K&quot; and &quot;T&quot; (tenor) is the &quot;absolute volatility surface&quot;. The simplest non-trivial moneyness is the ratio of these, either &quot;S&quot;/&quot;K&quot; or its reciprocal &quot;K&quot;/&quot;S,&quot; which is known as the (spot) simple moneyness, with analogous forward simple moneyness. Conventionally the fixed quantity is in the denominator, while the variable quantity is in the numerator, so &quot;S&quot;/&quot;K&quot; for a single option and varying spots, and &quot;K&quot;/&quot;S&quot; for different options at a given spot, such as when constructing a volatility surface. A volatility surface using coordinates a non-trivial moneyness &quot;M&quot; and time to expiry &quot;τ&quot; is called the &quot;relative volatility surface&quot; (with respect to the moneyness &quot;M&quot;).

While the spot is often used by traders, the forward is preferred in theory, as it has better properties, thus &quot;F&quot;/&quot;K&quot; will be used in the sequel. In practice, for low interest rates and short tenors, spot versus forward makes little difference.

In (call) simple moneyness, ATM corresponds to moneyness of 1, while ITM corresponds to greater than 1, and OTM corresponds to less than 1, with equivalent levels of ITM/OTM corresponding to reciprocals. This is linearized by taking the log, yielding the log simple moneyness formula_2 In the log simple moneyness, ATM corresponds to 0, while ITM is positive and OTM is negative, and corresponding levels of ITM/OTM corresponding to switching sign. Note that once logs are taken, moneyness in terms of forward or spot differ by an additive factor (log of discount factor), as formula_3

The above measures are independent of time, but for a given simple moneyness, options near expiry and far from expiry behave differently, as options far from expiry have more time for the underlying to change. Accordingly, one may incorporate time to maturity &quot;τ&quot; into moneyness. Since dispersion of Brownian motion is proportional to the square root of time, one may divide the log simple moneyness by this factor, yielding: formula_4 This effectively normalizes for time to expiry – with this measure of moneyness, volatility smiles are largely independent of time to expiry.

This measure does not account for the volatility &quot;σ&quot; of the underlying asset. Unlike previous inputs, volatility is not directly observable from market data, but must instead be computed in some model, primarily using ATM implied volatility in the Black–Scholes model. Dispersion is proportional to volatility, so standardizing by volatility yields:
:formula_5
This is known as the standardized moneyness (forward), and measures moneyness in standard deviation units.

In words, the standardized moneyness is the number of standard deviations the current forward price is above the strike price. Thus the moneyness is zero when the forward price of the underlying equals the strike price, when the option is &quot;at-the-money-forward&quot;. Standardized moneyness is measured in standard deviations from this point, with a positive value meaning an in-the-money call option and a negative value meaning an out-of-the-money call option (with signs reversed for a put option).

===Black–Scholes formula auxiliary variables===
The standardized moneyness is closely related to the auxiliary variables in the Black–Scholes formula, namely the terms &quot;d&quot;+ = &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;− = &quot;d&quot;2, which are defined as:
:formula_6
The standardized moneyness is the average of these:
:formula_7
and they are ordered as:
:formula_8
differing only by a step of formula_9 in each case. This is often small, so the quantities are often confused or conflated, though they have distinct interpretations.

As these are all in units of standard deviations, it makes sense to convert these to percentages, by evaluating the standard normal cumulative distribution function &quot;N&quot; for these values. The interpretation of these quantities is somewhat subtle, and consists of changing to a risk-neutral measure with specific choice of numéraire. In brief, these are interpreted (for a call option) as:
* &quot;N&quot;(&quot;d&quot;−) is the (Future Value) price of a binary call option, or the risk-neutral likelihood that the option will expire ITM, with numéraire cash (the risk-free asset);
* &quot;N&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is the percentage corresponding to standardized moneyness;
* &quot;N&quot;(&quot;d&quot;+) is the Delta, or the risk-neutral likelihood that the option will expire ITM, with numéraire asset.
These have the same ordering, as &quot;N&quot; is monotonic (since it is a CDF):
:formula_10

Of these, &quot;N&quot;(&quot;d&quot;−) is the (risk-neutral) &quot;likelihood of expiring in the money&quot;, and thus the theoretically correct percent moneyness, with &quot;d&quot;− the correct moneyness. The percent moneyness is the implied probability that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. Thus a moneyness of 0 yields a 50% probability of expiring ITM, while a moneyness of 1 yields an approximately 84% probability of expiring ITM.

This corresponds to the asset following geometric Brownian motion with drift &quot;r,&quot; the risk-free rate, and diffusion &quot;σ,&quot; the implied volatility. Drift is the mean, with the corresponding median (50th percentile) being &quot;r&quot;−&quot;σ&quot;2/2, which is the reason for the correction factor. Note that this is the &quot;implied&quot; probability, &quot;not&quot; the real-world probability.

The other quantities – (percent) standardized moneyness and Delta – are not identical to the actual percent moneyness, but in many practical cases these are quite close (unless volatility is high or time to expiry is long), and Delta is commonly used by traders as a measure of (percent) moneyness. Delta is more than moneyness, with the (percent) standardized moneyness in between. Thus a 25 Delta call option has less than 25% moneyness, usually slightly less, and a 50 Delta &quot;ATM&quot; call option has less than 50% moneyness; these discrepancies can be observed in prices of binary options and vertical spreads. Note that for puts, Delta is negative, and thus negative Delta is used – more uniformly, absolute value of Delta is used for call/put moneyness.

The meaning of the factor of (&quot;σ&quot;2/2)&quot;τ&quot; is relatively subtle. For &quot;d&quot;− and &quot;m&quot; this corresponds to the difference between the median and mean (respectively) of geometric Brownian motion (the log-normal distribution), and is the same correction factor in Itō&#x27;s lemma for geometric Brownian motion. The interpretation of &quot;d&quot;+, as used in Delta, is subtler, and can be interpreted most elegantly as change of numéraire. In more elementary terms, the probability that the option expires in the money and the value of the underlying at exercise are not independent – the higher the price of the underlying, the more likely it is to expire in the money &quot;and&quot; the higher the value at exercise, hence why Delta is higher than moneyness.

<text>Margaret Madeline Chase Smith (née Chase; December 14, 1897 – May 29, 1995) was an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, she served as a U.S. representative (1940–1949) and a U.S. senator (1949–1973) from Maine. She was the first woman to serve in both houses of the United States Congress. A Republican, she was among the first to criticize the tactics of Joseph McCarthy in her 1950 speech, &quot;Declaration of Conscience&quot;.

Smith was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1964 election; she was the first woman to be placed in nomination for the presidency at a major party&#x27;s convention. Upon leaving office, she was the longest-serving female senator in history, a distinction that was not surpassed until January 4, 2011, when Senator Barbara Mikulski from Maryland exceeded her record. Smith was ranked as the longest-serving Republican woman in the Senate, a distinction that was not surpassed until January 3, 2021, when Susan Collins, who holds the same Senate seat she previously held, was sworn in for a fifth term.

== Early life and education ==
Margaret Chase was born in Skowhegan in central Maine, to Carrie Matilda (née Murray) and George Emery Chase. She was the oldest of six children, two of whom did not survive to adulthood. Her father was of English ancestry, a descendant of immigrants to the original Thirteen Colonies in the 17th century; her great-great grandfather commanded an artillery company during the War of 1812, and her grandfather served in the Union Army during the Civil War. Her mother&#x27;s family was French Canadian, having immigrated from Quebec in the middle of the 19th century; her grandfather Lambert Morin changed his name to John Murray to avoid anti-French Canadian and anti-Catholic prejudice. Her father was the town barber, and her mother worked as a waitress, store clerk, and shoe factory worker.

She received her early education at Lincoln and Garfield Elementary Schools. At age 12, she went to work at a local five-and-dime store and even bought herself a life insurance policy. She also shaved her father&#x27;s customers when he was busy or away from the shop. She attended Skowhegan High School, graduating in 1916. During high school, she played on the girls&#x27; basketball team, of which she was captain in her senior year. She also worked as a substitute operator with a telephone company during this time. In that position she met Clyde Smith, a prominent local politician, who arranged a job for her as a part-time assistant to the tax assessor.

== Early career ==
Following her high school graduation, Chase briefly taught at the Pitts School, a one-room school near Skowhegan. She also coached the girls&#x27; basketball team at Skowhegan High (1917–18). She was a business executive for the Maine Telephone and Telegraph Company (1918–1919) before joining the staff of the &quot;Independent Reporter&quot;, a Skowhegan weekly newspaper (owned by Clyde Smith) for whom she was circulation manager from 1919 to 1928. She became involved with local women&#x27;s organizations. She co-founded the Skowhegan chapter of the Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Club in 1922, and served as editor of the club&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Pine Cone&quot;. From 1926 to 1928, she was president of the statewide organization, the Maine Federation of Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Clubs. She became treasurer of the New England Waste Process Company in 1928 and was also employed as an office worker with the Daniel E. Cummings Woolen Company, a local textile mill.

On May 14, 1930, Chase married Clyde Smith, who was 21 years her senior. She soon became active in politics and was elected to the Maine Republican State Committee, on which she served from 1930 to 1936. After Clyde was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in 1936, Smith accompanied her husband to Washington, D.C., to serve as his secretary. In this position, she managed his office, handled his correspondence, conducted research, and helped write his speeches. She also served as treasurer of the Congressional Club, a group composed of the wives of congressmen and Cabinet members.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

In the spring of 1940, Clyde Smith fell seriously ill after suffering a heart attack, and asked his wife to run for his House seat in the general election the following September. He prepared a press release in which he stated, &quot;I know of no one else who has the full knowledge of my ideas and plans or is as well qualified as she is, to carry on these ideas and my unfinished work for my district.&quot; He died on April 8 of that year, and a special election was scheduled on the following June 3 to complete his unexpired term. Facing no Democratic challenger, Smith won the special election and became the first woman elected to Congress from Maine. Three months after the special election, she was elected to a full two-year term in the House in her own right. Smith defeated Edward J. Beauchamp, the Democratic mayor of Lewiston, by a margin of 65–35%. She was re-elected to three more terms over the course of the next eight years, never receiving less than 60% of the vote.

During her tenure in the House, Smith developed a strong interest in issues concerning the military and national security. After being appointed to the House Naval Affairs Committee in 1943, she was assigned to the investigation of destroyer production, and made a 25,000-mile (40,234-km) tour of bases in the South Pacific during the winter of 1944. She also became the first and only civilian woman to sail on a U.S. Navy ship during World War II. She became known as &quot;Mother of the WAVES&quot; after introducing legislation to create that organization. Although Congresswoman Smith was a strong supporter of women in the armed services, she did not write the legislation that created the special female military units during World War II. She did, however, champion the legislation that gave women permanent status in the military following the war.

A supporter of President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s foreign policies, she was mentioned as a possible candidate for Under Secretary of the Navy in 1945 and for Assistant Secretary of State in 1947. Smith became a member of the House Armed Services Committee in 1946, also serving as chair of its Subcommittee on Hospitalization and Medicine. In this position, she sponsored and ensured the passage of the Women&#x27;s Armed Services Integration Act, a bill to regularize the status of women in the armed forces that was signed into law by President Truman in June 1948.

Smith also earned a reputation as a moderate Republican who often broke ranks with her party. She supported much of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal legislation, as had her husband while he was in office. She voted in favor of the Selective Service Act in 1940 and voted against the Smith–Connally Act in 1943. In 1945, she voted against making the House Un-American Activities Committee a permanent body.

As a member of the House, Smith began wearing a single red rose that became a daily fixture of her attire throughout her career in public office. She waged a long campaign to have the rose declared the official flower of the United States, which Congress eventually approved in 1987.

== U.S. Senate ==

=== 1948 election ===
In August 1947, after three-term incumbent Wallace H. White Jr. decided to retire, Smith announced her candidacy for his seat in the U.S. Senate. In the Republican primary, she faced incumbent Governor Horace A. Hildreth, former Governor Sumner Sewall, and Reverend Albion Beverage. She ran a grassroots campaign with little money, using the slogan, &quot;Don&#x27;t change a record for a promise.&quot; When the wife of one of her opponents questioned whether a woman would be a good Senator, Smith replied, &quot;Women administer the home. They set the rules, enforce them, mete out justice for violations. Thus, like Congress, they legislate; like the Executive, they administer; like the courts, they interpret the rules. It is an ideal experience for politics.&quot; On June 21, 1948, she won the primary election and received more votes than her three opponents combined. In the general election on September 13, she defeated Democrat Adrian H. Scolten by a margin of 71–29%. She became the first woman to represent Maine in the Senate, and the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress.

=== Early tenure ===
Smith was sworn into the Senate on January 3, 1949. After a year in office, she gained national attention when she became the first member of Congress to condemn the anti-Communist witch hunt led by her fellow Republican Senator, Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin. Smith was initially impressed by McCarthy&#x27;s accusations of Communists working in the State Department, but became disillusioned after McCarthy failed to provide any evidence to validate his charges.

Smith voted in favor of Harry Truman&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination of Tom C. Clark on August 18, 1949, but was absent during the nomination of Sherman Minton while Senate Minority Whip Leverett Saltonstall announced that Smith would have voted in favor if present. Smith was present in the United States Senate on March 1, 1954, when Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s nomination of Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the United States was unanimously confirmed, voted in favor of the nomination of John Marshall Harlan II on March 16, 1955, was present for the unanimous nominations of William J. Brennan Jr. and Charles Evans Whittaker on March 19, 1957, and voted in favor of the nomination of Potter Stewart on May 5, 1959. She opposed the tactics being used by members of her party, such as Joseph McCarthy, and spoke out saying, &quot;As an American, I condemn a Republican Fascist just as much as I condemn a Democrat Communist. They are equally dangerous to you and me and to our country. As an American, I want to see our nation recapture the strength and unity it once had when we fought the enemy instead of ourselves.&quot;

=== Declaration of Conscience and after until 1960===
On June 1, 1950, Smith delivered a fifteen-minute speech on the Senate floor, known as the &quot;Declaration of Conscience,&quot; in which she refused to name McCarthy directly but denounced &quot;the reckless abandon in which unproved charges have been hurled from this side of the aisle.&quot; She said McCarthyism had &quot;debased&quot; the Senate to &quot;the level of a forum of hate and character assassination.&quot; She defended every American&#x27;s &quot;right to criticize... right to hold unpopular beliefs... right to protest; the right of independent thought.&quot; While acknowledging her desire for Republicans&#x27; political success, she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horsemen of calumny—fear, ignorance, bigotry, and smear.&quot; Six other moderate Republican Senators signed on to her Declaration: Wayne Morse from Oregon, George Aiken from Vermont, Edward Thye from Minnesota, Irving Ives from New York, Charles Tobey from New Hampshire, and Robert C. Hendrickson from New Jersey. Her speech ended with a warning: &quot;It is high time that we all stopped being tools and victims of totalitarian techniques—techniques that, if continued here unchecked, will surely end what we have come to cherish as the American way of life.&quot;

In response to her speech, McCarthy referred to Smith and the six other Senators as &quot;Snow White and the Six Dwarfs.&quot; He removed her as a member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, giving her seat to Senator Richard Nixon from California. He also helped finance an unsuccessful primary challenger during Smith&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1954. Smith later observed, &quot;If I am to be remembered in history, it will not be because of legislative accomplishments, but for an act I took as a legislator in the U.S. Senate when on June 1, 1950, I spoke ... in condemnation of McCarthyism, when the junior Senator from Wisconsin had the Senate paralyzed with fear that he would purge any Senator who disagreed with him.&quot; She voted for McCarthy&#x27;s censure in 1954.

On July 17, 1950, Smith was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve, and she served until 1958.

In the 1952 election, Smith was widely mentioned as a vice-presidential candidate under General Dwight D. Eisenhower. When asked by a reporter what she would do if she woke up one morning and found herself in the White House, she replied: &quot;I&#x27;d go straight to Mrs. Truman and apologize. Then I&#x27;d go home.&quot; At that year&#x27;s Republican National Convention, a group of women delegates (led by former congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce) had sought to nominate Smith. Smith, however, requested not to be proposed at the convention as a vice presidential delegate. Noting that Eisenhower&#x27;s supporters had coalesced around Richard Nixon for the vice presidential nomination, Luce withdrew her nomination of Smith in the convention&#x27;s vice presidential balloting.

On December 3, 1957, Smith became the first woman in Congress to break the sound barrier, which she did as a passenger in an F-100 Super Sabre piloted by Air Force Major Clyde Good.

Exhibiting the same independent nature in the Senate as she had in the House, Smith opposed President Eisenhower&#x27;s nomination of Lewis Strauss as Secretary of Commerce in 1959.

=== 1960 re-election ===
In her successful re-election campaign in 1960, she ran against Democrat Lucia Cormier, the minority leader of the Maine House of Representatives; it was the first time in American history that two women ran against each other for a Senate seat.

=== 1964 presidential election ===

On January 27, 1964, Smith announced her candidacy for President of the United States. She declared, &quot;I have few illusions and no money, but I&#x27;m staying for the finish. When people keep telling you you can&#x27;t do a thing, you kind of like to try.&quot; Gladys Shelley wrote her a presidential nomination campaign song, &quot;Leave It to the Girls&quot;, which was sung by Hildegarde. Smith lost every single primary election, but did manage to win 25% of the vote in Illinois. At the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, she became the first woman to have her name be placed in nomination for the presidency at a major political party&#x27;s convention. She placed fifth in the initial balloting, and denied unanimous consent for Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona after refusing to withdraw her name from the final ballot. She nevertheless campaigned for Goldwater in the general election, appearing in a television ad in which she defended his position on Social Security.

=== Later tenure ===
During the administration of President John F. Kennedy, Smith argued that the United States should use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union. This led Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to call Smith &quot;the devil in disguise of a woman&quot; whose position exceeded &quot;all records of savagery.&quot; Smith later replied, &quot;Mr. Khrushchev isn&#x27;t really mad at me. I am not that important. He is angry because American officials have grown more firm since my speech.&quot; The morning after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963, she went into the Senate chamber before it convened and laid a rose on the desk Kennedy had occupied as a Senator. A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she supported the Vietnam War but opposed the deployment of the Sentinel anti-ballistic missile.

Smith was the first (and as yet only) woman to serve as chair of the Senate Republican Conference, serving from 1967 to 1972. She was a strong supporter of the space program and served as a charter member of the Senate Aeronautical and Space Committee. NASA administrator James E. Webb once commented that the United States never would have placed a man on the Moon if it were not for Smith. She supported increased educational funding, civil rights, and the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, being one of thirteen Republican senators to vote in favor of both health programs. Smith voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. She held an all-time voting record in the Senate until 1981 with 2,941 consecutive roll call votes.

Smith was present in the Senate when Kennedy&#x27;s Supreme Court nominations of Byron White and Arthur Goldberg to the U.S. Supreme Court were unanimously confirmed on April 11, 1962, and on September 25, 1962, respectively. Smith was present in the Senate when Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s nomination of Abe Fortas was unanimously confirmed on August 11, 1965, and voted in favor of the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall on August 30, 1967. On June 9, 1969, Smith voted in favor of President Nixon&#x27;s nomination of Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States. Smith voted against Nixon&#x27;s failed Supreme Court nomination of Clement Haynsworth on November 21, 1969, and a few months later, Smith voted against Nixon&#x27;s failed Supreme Court nomination of Harrold Carswell on April 8, 1970. The following month, Smith voted in favor of Nixon&#x27;s nomination of Harry Blackmun on May 12, 1970. On December 6, 1971, Smith voted in favor of Nixon&#x27;s nomination of Lewis F. Powell Jr., and on December 10, Smith was absent when Nixon&#x27;s nomination of William Rehnquist as Associate Justice was confirmed while Senate Minority Whip Robert P. Griffin announced that Smith would have voted in favor if present.

=== 1972 election ===
She was defeated for re-election in 1972 by Democrat Bill Hathaway, the only election she ever lost in the state of Maine. In her last election, Smith had been plagued by rumors of poor health (she had been using a motor scooter around the Senate). Her Republican primary challenger, attorney Robert A. G. Monks, taunted her for being out of touch; she did not have a state office operating in Maine. Smith lost the election by 27,230 votes, a margin of 53–47%.

=== Awards and honors ===
She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. In 1973, Smith was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1995 Smith was awarded the Naval Heritage Award by the US Navy Memorial Foundation for her support of the US Navy, US Naval Reserves WAVES, and the military during her congressional career. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush on July 6, 1989.

== Later life and death ==
Following her departure from the Senate in January 1973, Smith taught at several colleges and universities as a visiting professor for the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation (1973–1976). She resumed her residence in Skowhegan, where she oversaw the construction of a library to hold her papers.

At age 97, Smith died in her native Skowhegan in 1995, after suffering a stroke eight days earlier that had left her in a coma. She was cremated, and her ashes were placed in the residential wing of the Margaret Chase Smith Library in Skowhegan. She was the last living U.S. senator who had been born in the 19th century.

== Legacy ==
She is the namesake for the Maine State Ferry Service&#x27;s Islesboro Ferry.

A large framed painting of Smith hangs in the Maine State House in Augusta, Maine.

On February 2, 1952, Smith was the guest on the CBS variety show &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;, in which hostess Faye Emerson visited
Washington, D.C., to accent the kinds of music popular in the nation&#x27;s capital.

On June 14, 1953, she was the &quot;mystery celebrity&quot; guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

In 1958, Folkways Records released the album &quot;An Interview with Margaret Chase Smith&quot;, in which she spoke of women in local and national politics, and addressed the youth of the nation.

In 1961, Smith published her favorite family recipe, Maine Clam Chowder, in support of the Gold Star Wives of America military family support organization.

Patricia Neal dramatized Senator Smith&#x27;s Declaration of Conscience speech in the 1978 television movie &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot;.

In 1965, she was awarded the Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Whittier College.

In 1970, the twin Margaret Chase Smith bridges opened in Smith&#x27;s hometown of Skowhegan, Maine, connecting Skowhegan Island to either side of the Kennebec River.

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Smith&#x27;s name and picture.

Janis Benson portrayed Senator Smith in the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.

On June 13, 2007, the United States Postal Service issued a 58¢ postage stamp in its Distinguished Americans series to honor her.

In 2010, the United States political action committee Maggie&#x27;s List was founded, named after Smith; it works to &quot;raise awareness and funds to increase the number of conservative women elected to federal public office.&quot;

On June 8, 2022, a room in the United States Capitol was named after Smith (the Margaret Chase Smith room). It is one of the first two rooms in the Capitol to be named after women who were senators, the other being the Barbara Mikulski room, which was named on the same day.

<text>USENIX is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization based in Berkeley, California and founded in 1975 that supports advanced computing systems, operating system (OS), and computer networking research. It organizes several conferences in these fields.

== History ==
USENIX was established in 1975 under the name &quot;Unix Users Group,&quot; focusing primarily on the study and development of the Unix OS family and similar systems. In June 1977, a lawyer from AT&amp;T Corporation informed the group that they could not use the word &quot;Unix&quot; in their name as it was a trademark of Western Electric (the manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T until 1995), which led to the change of name to USENIX. Since its founding, it has published a technical journal titled &quot;;login:&quot;.

USENIX was started as a technical organization. As commercial interest grew, a number of separate groups started in parallel, most notably the Software Tools Users Group (STUG), a technical adjunct for Unix-like tools and interface on non-Unix operating systems, and /usr/group, a commercially oriented user group.

USENIX&#x27;s founding President was Lou Katz.

==Conferences==
USENIX hosts numerous conferences and symposia each year, including:

*USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) (was bi-annual till 2020)
*USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security)
*USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST)
*USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI)
*USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC) (co-located with OSDI since 2021)
*SREcon, a conference for engineers focused on site reliability, systems engineering, and working with complex distributed systems at scale
*LISA, the Large Installation System Administration Conference
*Enigma, a conference focused on practical privacy and security expertise and knowledge sharing in a welcoming and inclusive environment

== Publications ==
USENIX publishes a magazine called &quot;;login:&quot; that appears four times a year. From 2021, it has become an all-digital magazine and openly accessible. &quot;;login:&quot; content informs the community about practically relevant research, useful tools, and relevant events.

<doc id="253585" wikidata="Q1345201" url="?curid=253585" title="Henry M. Jackson">
<text>Henry Martin &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson (May 31, 1912 – September 1, 1983) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a U.S. representative (1941–1953) and U.S. senator (1953–1983) from the state of Washington. A Cold War liberal and anti-Communist member of the Democratic Party, Jackson supported higher military spending and a hard line against the Soviet Union, while also supporting social welfare programs, civil rights, and labor unions.

Born in Everett, Washington, to Norwegian immigrants, Jackson practiced law in Everett, after graduating from the University of Washington School of Law. He won election to Congress in 1940, and joined the Senate in 1953 after defeating incumbent Republican Party senator Harry P. Cain. Jackson supported the civil rights movement of the 1960s, and authored the National Environmental Policy Act, which helped establish the principle of publicly analyzing environmental impacts. He co-sponsored the Jackson–Vanik amendment, which denied normal trade relations to non-capitalist countries with restrictive emigration policies. Jackson served as chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from 1963 to 1981. He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic Party nomination in the 1972 and 1976 presidential elections. While still serving in the Senate, Jackson died in 1983.

His political beliefs were characterized by support of civil rights, human rights, and safeguarding the environment, but with an equally strong commitment to oppose totalitarianism in general and — with the start of the Cold War — communist rule in particular. Jackson&#x27;s political philosophies and positions have been cited as an influence on a number of key figures associated with neoconservatism, including Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, both of whom previously served as aides to Jackson.

== Early life ==
Jackson was born in the home of his parents, Marine (née Andersen) and Peter Jackson, in Everett, Washington, on May 31, 1912. His mother and father were both immigrants from Norway. Peter Jackson was born Peter Gresseth in the Kristiansund area, and changed his name when he immigrated. He met Marine, who was born in Alvenes at the Lutheran church in Everett, where they were married in 1897. Henry was the fifth, and youngest, of the Jackson children; he was nicknamed &quot;Scoop&quot; by his sister in his childhood, after a comic strip character that he was said to have resembled. Jackson was a member of the National Honor Society. He went on to graduate with a B.A. degree from Stanford University, and a J.D. degree from the University of Washington School of Law, where he joined the Delta Chi fraternity.

== Early career ==
In 1935, the year of his law school graduation, he was admitted to the bar, and began to practice law in Everett. He found immediate success, and was elected to become the prosecuting attorney for Snohomish County from 1938 to 1940, where he made a name for himself prosecuting bootleggers and gamblers.

== Personal life ==
In 1961, Jackson, called by &quot;Time&quot; the Senate&#x27;s &quot;most eligible bachelor&quot;, married Helen Hardin, a 28-year-old Senate receptionist who was 20 years his junior. Jackson did not move out of his childhood home, where he lived with his unmarried sisters for several years. The Jacksons had two children: Anna Marie Laurence and Peter Jackson. Peter went on to serve as a speechwriter for Governor Christine Gregoire and to lead the effort to found the Center for Human Rights at the University of Washington, which now has a scholarship in his name.

== In Congress ==
Jackson successfully ran for the U.S. Congress as a Democrat in 1940 and took his seat in the House of Representatives with the 77th Congress on January 3, 1941. From then on, Jackson did not lose any congressional elections. Jackson joined the Army when the United States entered World War II but left when Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered all representatives to return home or resign their seats. He visited the Buchenwald concentration camp a few days after its liberation in 1945. He also visited his native Norway, where he observed the repatriation to Russia of Red Army soldiers captured by the Nazis, in which he recalled&quot;I remember how reluctant most Russians were to return to the Soviet Union. They knew they would have even less freedom there.&quot;

He attended the International Maritime Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1945 with the American delegation, and he was elected president of the same conference in 1946, when it was held in Seattle. From 1945 to 1947, Jackson was also the chairman of the House Indian Affairs Committee. In the 1952 U.S. House election, Jackson relinquished his seat in the House for a run for one of Washington&#x27;s Senate seats. Jackson soundly defeated Republican senator Harry P. Cain and remained a senator for over thirty years. He was Washington&#x27;s first U.S. senator to be born in the state. Jackson died in office in 1983 after winning re-election for the fifth time in 1982.

Although Jackson opposed the excesses of Joe McCarthy, who had traveled to Washington state to campaign against him, he criticized Dwight Eisenhower for not spending enough on national defense. Jackson called for more inter-continental ballistic missiles in the national arsenal, and his support for nuclear weapons resulted in a primary challenge from the left in 1958, when he handily defeated Seattle peace activist Alice Franklin Bryant before winning re-election with 67 percent of the vote, which he topped the next four times he ran for re-election.

During the 1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Jackson was the first choice of fellow senator John F. Kennedy for a running mate; Kennedy became convinced that a Southerner would better balance the ticket. Lyndon B. Johnson was later selected. Jackson boasted one of the strongest records on civil rights during the civil rights movement. He supported the 1957 and the 1964 Civil Rights Acts. On July 22, 1965, Johnson signed the Water Resources Planning Act into law, citing Jackson as one of the Congress members to &quot;have made a very invaluable and very farsighted contribution to America&#x27;s future.&quot; In April 1968, responding to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Jackson gave a speech about the legacy and injustice of inequality.

In 1963, Jackson was made chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, which became the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in 1977, a position he held until 1981. In the 1970s, Jackson joined with fellow senators Ernest Hollings and Edward Kennedy in a press conference to oppose Gerald Ford&#x27;s request for Congress to end Richard Nixon&#x27;s price controls on domestic oil, which had provoked oil companies into withholding gasoline during the 1973 oil crisis. Kaufman writes that, after 1968, Jackson &quot;emerged as an intellectual and political leader in the perennial struggle of U.S. foreign policy to reconcile ideals with self-interest.&quot;

Jackson authored the National Environmental Policy Act, which has been called one of the most influential environmental laws in history. It helped to stimulate similar laws and the principle of publicly analyzed environmental impact in other states and in much of the world. Jackson was also a leader of the fight for statehood for Alaska and Hawaii. In 1974, Jackson sponsored the Jackson–Vanik amendment in the Senate (with Charles Vanik sponsoring it in the House), which denied normal trade relations to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted the freedom of emigration. The amendment was intended to help refugees, particularly minorities, specifically Jews, to emigrate from the Soviet Bloc. Jackson and his assistant, Richard Perle, also lobbied personally for some people who were affected by this law such as Natan Sharansky.

Throughout his time as senator, Jackson was a strong supporter of Israel. In 1970, he urged President Nixon to sell F-4 Phantom II fighter jets to that country, on the terms that amounted to a grant. During the Yom Kippur War, Jackson, alongside fellow Congressional leaders demanded an urgent resupply of weapons, to ensure that Israeli forces would have the material, diplomatic and political support necessary for a victory. When the Nixon administration balked at direct and visible material support, Jackson worked with Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, Director of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs Seymor Weiss, and senior American military commanders, notably Chief of Naval Operations Elmo Zumwalt, to secure the decision to airlift vital weapons and ammunition to a &quot;gravely imperiled IDF&quot;.

In 1975, after President Ford announced he would not invite Soviet dissident Aleksander Solzhenitsyn to the White House, for fear of angering the Soviet Union, Jackson and a group of other senators asked Solzhenitsyn to speak at an office in the Capitol. Jackson was also one of the first senators to call for the normalization of relations with China, and was instrumental in arranging many business, educational, and community contacts between Washington and China.

In March 1975, Jackson released a statement in which he expressed the view that it was paramount the Franklin Peroff case be found out to be either &quot;an aberration or was symptomatic of much greater problem&quot; within the Drug Enforcement Administration. In June 1975, Jackson stated that if accounts about the conduct of former director of the Drug Enforcement Agency John R. Bartels Jr. were correct then his actions amounted to obstruction of justice and that evidence disclosed &quot;in the last two days would indicate that there was a conscious, premeditated plan involving misconduct at the highest levels of the D.E.A.&quot;

In July 1977, the Senate approved a funding for the experimental nuclear reactor compromise proposal by Jackson and Idaho senator Frank Church. While the initial version by Jimmy Carter sought a decrease in funding from 150 million to 33 million, the Jackson and Church measure halved the funding to 75 million. In October 1979, the Senate voted in favor of Carter&#x27;s energy mobilization board plan, Jackson labeling the plan the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of Carter&#x27;s program that was essential to guaranteeing the effectiveness of the rest of the legislation and was noted for successfully persuading colleagues to reject amendments to the plan. Later that month, after the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted in favor of the Alaska public lands legislation, Carter issued a statement thanking Jackson and other members for supporting the legislation.
Jackson led the opposition within the Democratic Party against the SALT II treaty. For decades, Democrats who support a strong international presence for the United States have been called &quot;Scoop Jackson Democrats,&quot; and the term was still used to describe Democrats such as Joe Lieberman and R. James Woolsey Jr by the aughts.

Jackson served for all but the last three years of his Senate tenure with Democratic colleague and friend Warren G. Magnuson. As a result, he spent 28 years as the state&#x27;s junior senator, even though he had more seniority than all but a few of his colleagues. &quot;Scoop&quot; and &quot;Maggie&quot;, as they affectionately called each other, gave Washington clout in national politics well beyond its population. They were one of the most effective delegations in the history of the Senate in terms of &quot;bringing home the bacon&quot; for their home state. Washington received nearly a sixth of public works appropriations but ranked only 23rd in population.

=== Criticism ===
Jackson was known as a hawkish Democrat. He was often criticized for his support for the Vietnam War and his close ties to the defense industries of his state. His proposal of Fort Lawton as a site for an anti-ballistic missile system was strongly opposed by local residents, and Jackson was forced to modify his position on the location of the site several times, but continued to support ABM development. American Indian rights activists who protested Jackson&#x27;s plan to give Fort Lawton to Seattle, instead of returning it to local tribes, staged a sit-in. In the eventual compromise, most of Fort Lawton became Discovery Park, with leased to United Indians of All Tribes, who opened the Daybreak Star Cultural Center there in 1977.

Opponents derided him as &quot;the senator from Boeing&quot;, as well as a &quot;whore for Boeing&quot;, because of his consistent support for additional military spending on weapons systems and accusations of wrongful contributions from the company; in 1965, 80% of Boeing&#x27;s contracts were military. Jackson and Magnuson&#x27;s campaigning for an expensive government supersonic transport plane project eventually failed. In addition, contrary to claims that he was an environmentalist, Jackson was almost as much a &quot;whore for logging companies&quot; as for Boeing, according Carsten Lien&#x27;s book &quot;Olympic Battleground&quot;.

After his death, critics pointed to Jackson&#x27;s support for Japanese American internment camps during World War II as a reason to protest the placement of his bust at the University of Washington. Jackson was both an enthusiastic defender of the evacuation and a staunch proponent of the campaign to keep the Japanese-Americans from returning to the Pacific Coast after the war.

== Presidential campaigns ==
Jackson was not only successful as a politician in Washington state, but he also found recognition on the national level. He rose to the position of chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1960, after being considered for the vice presidential ticket spot that eventually went to fellow senator Lyndon B. Johnson. Jackson ran for president twice, and both campaigns were noted for the hostile reception they received from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Jackson&#x27;s one-on-one campaigning skills, which were extremely successful in Washington state, did not translate as well to the national stage. Even his supporters admitted that he suffered from a certain lack of charisma.

=== 1972 presidential campaign ===
Jackson was little known nationally when he first ran in 1972. George McGovern, who eventually won the nomination, even accused Jackson of racism for his opposition to busing despite Jackson&#x27;s longstanding record on civil rights issues. Jackson&#x27;s high point in the campaign was a distant third in the early Florida primary, but he failed to stand out of the pack of better-known rivals, and he made real news only later in the campaign, as part of the &quot;Stop McGovern&quot; coalition, which raised what would be known as the &quot;Acid, Amnesty and Abortion&quot; questions about McGovern. Jackson suspended active campaigning in May after a weak showing in the Ohio primary and finishing well behind McGovern, Ed Muskie, George Wallace, and Hubert Humphrey in early primaries.

Jackson re-emerged at the July Democratic convention after the runner-up, Humphrey, dropped out of the race. Jackson&#x27;s name was placed in nomination by Georgia governor Jimmy Carter, and he finished second in the delegate roll call, well behind nominee McGovern. While campaigning in New York City, Jackson invited Meir Kahane, the leader of the violent organization the Jewish Defense League, to stand with him on stage in order to gain favor with Jewish Americans.

=== 1976 presidential campaign ===

Jackson raised his national profile by speaking out on Soviet-U.S. relations and Middle East policy regularly, and he was considered a front-runner for the nomination when he announced the start of his campaign in February 1975. Jackson received substantial financial support from Jewish-Americans who admired his pro-Israel views, but his support of the Vietnam War resulted in hostility from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Jackson chose to run on social issues, emphasizing law and order and his opposition to busing. He was hoping for support from labor, but the possibility that Hubert Humphrey might enter the race caused unions to offer only lukewarm support. Jackson made the fateful decision not to compete in the early Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, which Carter won after liberals split their votes among four other candidates. Even though Jackson won the Massachusetts and New York primaries, he dropped out on May 1 after losing the critical Pennsylvania primary to Carter by 12% and running out of money.

== Death ==

On the evening of September 1, 1983, Jackson suffered a heart attack at his home in Everett, and was pronounced dead at nearby Providence Hospital at the age of 71. His death came suddenly, occurring hours after he had given a news conference condemning the Soviet attack on Korean Air Lines Flight 007.

Jackson&#x27;s death was greatly mourned. New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan stated that &quot;Henry Jackson is proof of the old belief in the Judaic tradition that at any moment in history goodness in the world is preserved by the deeds of 36 just men who do not know that this is the role the Lord has given them. Henry Jackson was one of those men.&quot; Jackson is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Everett.

== Legacy ==
Jackson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1984. Ronald Reagan called him &quot;one of the greatest lawmakers of our century&quot;, and stated:
Soviet dissident and later Israeli politician Natan Sharansky recalled when he was imprisoned by the KGB that:
In 1983, Jackson was awarded Delta Chi of the Year. One of Jackson&#x27;s last acts as Senator was to sponsor legislation creating what became the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, which was named after him after his death. Jackson&#x27;s extended community of staff, colleagues and family members created the Henry M. Jackson Foundation from public monies and private donations to give grants to nonprofits and educational institutions. Its board members have included Richard Perle, Tom Foley, and Jeane Kirkpatrick.

The U.S. Navy ballistic missile submarine was named after him, in recognition of his longtime support of the nation&#x27;s military. It is the only Ohio-class submarine not named after a U.S. state. On March 28, 1981, Jackson gave the principal address at the christening of the USS &quot;Bremerton&quot; (SSN 698). The &quot;Bremerton&quot; was the second ship to have the name, preceded by the USS &quot;Bremerton&quot; (CA 130). It was christened by Mrs. Henry M. Jackson on July 22, 1978. The USS &quot;Bremerton&quot; (SSN 698) was mentioned in the classic Tom Clancy novel, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. The University of Washington has named the Jackson School of International Studies in his honor. However, students objecting to Jackson&#x27;s hawkish views on the Cold War in the mid-1980s caused the university to move a bust of the senator to the end of an abandoned corridor until it was restored to a more prominent place outside the Jackson School in 2006.

In 1983, the Snohomish County Public Utility District began operation of the Henry M. Jackson Hydroelectric Project outside Sultan, Washington. In 1994, the Everett School District completed construction of Henry M. Jackson High School in Mill Creek, Washington. The Henry M. Jackson Wilderness Area was created in his honor by the 1984 Washington Wilderness Act. The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, with the cooperation of the Jackson family, awards a Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson Distinguished Service Award to individuals for their career dedication to U.S. national security. Jackson won the first award in 1982, and it was named after him after his death. Winners include Max Cleland, Joe Lieberman, Dick Cheney, Jane Harman, and Paul Wolfowitz.

The Seattle-based Henry M. Jackson Foundation was created in 1983 by his former colleagues and staff, as well as his widow and other family members, to further his work. In 1987, the Department of Defense gave to the Jackson Foundation a one-time, $10 million appropriation for its endowment, in honor of the Senator. To date, the Foundation has awarded over $26 million in grants to educational and non-profit institutions. Jackson also sponsored legislation to form the Foundation to Advance Military Medicine, which was later renamed in his honor at the time of his death, to the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.

=== Influence on neoconservatism ===
Jackson believed that evil should be confronted with power. His support for civil rights and equality at home, married to his opposition to &quot;détente&quot;, his support for human rights, along with that of democratic allies, and his firm belief that the United States could be a force for good in the world, and inspired a legion of loyal aides who went on to propound Jackson&#x27;s philosophy as part of neoconservatism. In addition to Richard Perle, neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz, Bill Kristol, Elliot Abrams, Charles Horner, and Douglas Feith were former Democratic aides to Jackson who, disillusioned with the Carter administration, supported Ronald Reagan and joined his administration in 1981, later becoming prominent foreign policy makers in the 21st-century Bush administration. Neoconservative Ben Wattenberg was a prominent political aide to Jackson&#x27;s 1972 and 1976 presidential campaigns. Wolfowitz has called himself a &quot;Scoop Jackson Republican&quot; on multiple occasions. Many journalists and scholars across the political spectrum have noted links between Senator Jackson and modern neoconservatism.

Jackson&#x27;s influence on foreign policy has been cited as foundational to the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy, and the Iraq War. Jackson biographer Robert Kaufman says &quot;There is no question in my mind that the people who supported Iraq are supporting Henry Jackson&#x27;s instincts.&quot; Peter Beinart, author of &quot;The Good Fight: Why Liberals—and Only Liberals—Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again&quot;, argues that the Democratic Party should return to Jackson&#x27;s values in its foreign policy, criticizing current-day neoconservatives for failing to adopt Jackson&#x27;s domestic policy views along with his foreign policy views.

=== Henry Jackson Society ===
In 2005, the Henry Jackson Society was formed at the University of Cambridge, England. The non-partisan British group is dedicated to &quot;pursuit of a robust foreign policy ... based on clear universal principles such as the global promotion of the rule of law, liberal democracy, civil rights, environmental responsibility and the market economy&quot; as part of &quot;Henry Jackson&#x27;s legacy.&quot; The organization is now based in London and hosts high-profile speaker events in the House of Commons.

=== Jackson Papers controversy ===
Jackson&#x27;s documents were donated to the University of Washington shortly after his death in 1983, and have been archived there ever since. When the materials were donated in 1983, university staff removed all information considered classified at the time. Additional materials were added to the collection until 1995. At some point, library staff discovered a classified document in the collection and sent it to the government for declassification. In response, in the summer of 2004, a man who identified himself as an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) called the University of Washington asking to inspect Senator Jackson&#x27;s archived documents housed there. He found a document labeled as classified and showed this to a librarian.
In February 2005, 22 years after Jackson&#x27;s death, a five-person team including staff of the CIA, Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Information Security Oversight Office came to the library to review all of Jackson&#x27;s papers to remove anything still considered classified, or reclassified since then. The Department of Energy found nothing of concern, but the CIA blanked lines in about 20 papers and pulled 8 documents out of collection. , some files in the collection are available only to those regarded by the library as &quot;serious researchers&quot;, who must first sign a release not to divulge some of the information contained in the files.

<text>Lobos is the headquarters city of the Lobos Partido in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It was founded on 2 June 1802 by José Salgado.

==Background==
Located from Buenos Aires, Lobos is a fertile agricultural area known mainly because of the dairy activity and dairy-related products. Lobos Administrative Area is bordered by Navarro to the northwest; General Las Heras to the north; Cañuelas to the northeast; San Miguel del Monte to the east; Roque Pérez to the south and 25 de Mayo to the west.

The administrative area is as web divided into seven quarters: Arévalo, Carboni, Elvira, Empalme Lobos, Las Chacras, Salvador María and Zapiola.

&lt;br&gt;&quot;Lobos Administrative Area and its divisions&quot;

Besides the rural importance, Lobos is considered a tourist center within the Province of Buenos Aires, Lobos Lagoon being the most important feature. The lagoon is located some . from the city ( from Buenos Aires). Other areas of special interest are the local aerodrome, several ranches, a museum of sciences of nature and history, and Perón’s museum.

As far as its history is concerned, Lobos is known for being the place of birth of three times President Juan Domingo Perón born on 8 October 1895, and it is also the place where the gaucho legend Juan Moreira was killed in 1874 after struggling with the law.

Perón’s original house was restored and turned into a museum where photographs and personal items can be viewed, amid other ancient artifacts of Lobos history.

==History==
The history of Lobos began in 1740 when a Jesuit mission led by Reverend Father Falkner, who surveyed the centre and South of the Province of Buenos Aires and thus picked up some geographic information of the area.
In 1772 thanks to Falkner&#x27;s notes a map of the region was printed in London. The map contained the inscription Laguna de Lobos (Lagoon of Wolves, in Spanish) below the drawing of the lagoon.

It&#x27;s said that the name Lobos stems from the amount of otters that at that time populated the lagoon and were known as &quot;lobos de agua&quot; (&quot;water wolves&quot;) or &quot;lobos de río&quot; (&quot;river wolves&quot;), however, there are historians who believe Lobos had been given this name due to the wild dogs staying around and because they bore a resemblance to wolves.

By 1779 several guards settled down there and several forts, fortresses and military positions were built to form a defence wall against the natives. These positions were set up by order of viceroy Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo and named them Chascomús, Ranchos, Monte, Lobos, Navarro, Areco and Rojas.

On 21 August 1779 Gunnery Sergeant Pedro Rodríguez concluded the construction of the main parts of the fort San Pedro de Los Lobos, over the eastern bank of the Lagoon about 300 meters from its shoreline and nearly 1,500 meters east of the mouth of Las Garzas stream, finishing the work Lieutenant Bernardo Serrano.

By the end of 18th century José Salgado and his wife Pascuala Rivas de Salgado were granted an area to colonize as a donation made by viceroy Vértiz, founding Pago de Los Lobos on 2 June 1802.

Back in that time, their Christian faith brought them to build a straw-and-mud oratory, under advocation of Nuestra Señora del Carmen, forming the Chapel in June 1803 being the first priest doctor José García Miranda. The chapel became the urban core of Lobos.

Surveyor Federico C. De Meyrelles conducted important mesures, and planning in 1868, from which the city was constituted. The regime of city management started when Fructuoso Velásquez was named by the Cabildo of Buenos Aires as Mayor of the Brethrem in 1805; after the regime was modified, the first city councillor was Silvestre Cabral in 1822. after the first corporative city hall was established, with limited authority the first councillor and president of the city hall was Juan Antonio Cascallares in 1856. Finally, the first mayor of the autonomous community was Manuel Antonio Caminos Arévalo in 1877.

After the school councils were set up in 1875. the first president of the división for Lobos was presbyterian Felipe Olivera, who became parish in 1876.

The first councillor with exclusive functions was Felipe Aráoz between 1877 and 1878.

References to education in Lobos date back to the establishment of an elementary school by 1832, however, it is possible that there had already been school teachers settled in Lobos since 1826.

===Jesuit missions===
In 1872 a Catholic Misión arrived to Lobos and left wooden cruxes each with a brick basis as clue of its presence, located at the northern part of the city near Salgado Channel’s bank and there is another crux at the southern part of the city.

===Nuestra Señora Del Carmen Church===
The current church was opened in 1906 by Monsignor Terreno, bishop of La Plata and it was completed in 1912.

In the church lies the rests of the founder José Salgado, Colonel Domingo S. Arévalo, soldier of the Independence and parishes Enrique Ferroni, José Albertini and Emilio Larumbe.

The church is 49 meters long and 19 meters wide with a capacity for 2,000 people. The tower lifts 37 meters. The main altar is made up of Carrara marble and it boasts a peculiar beauty.

==Politics==

==Tourism==
Lobos is mainly known by its lagoon, the aerodrome, a museum of sciences, Juan Perón&#x27;s house, which has been turned into a museum, and several ranches.

==Lobos Lagoon==
The Lobos Lagoon (or Laguna de Lobos), at 15 km from Lobos and from the City of Buenos Aires is the main tourism attraction of the area.

It has an area of making it a favored place for fishing activities. Due to its surrounding which is rich in vegetation it is possible to host many birds. 

Since December 1988, the Sport Fishing Festival is held here annually at the Lobos Fishing Club, which was founded in 1945.. Various competences were declared by City Tourism Interest, the Province and the Nation. In this contest different activities are carried out, and on conclusion, the Queen of Fishing is selected. A music show is regularly held on a stage erected over the water.

The Lagoon sports its own boats and a long wharf, restaurants, grills, etc.

&quot;Loguercio Village&quot; is located over the northwestern margin of the lagoon and is inhabited by 400 people, but nearly 2,000 people only come to enjoy the weekend.

==Geography==
Lobos has a surface of 1,725 km2 and is bordered to the south by the Río Salado, which usually becomes the source of recurrent flooding. Lobos city is also limited by Salgado Channel, which comes from Río Salado. The southeastern area of the city is bordered by Muñiz Channel.

Salgado Channel splits the city from the countryside areas. Lobos also boasts 6 lagoons: Salada; Laguna Salada Chica; Laguna Culú Culú; Laguna de Colis; Laguna Seca, and the most important of all: Lobos Lagoon (Laguna de Lobos for Spanish).

In the 1980s geologist Víctor Mansione discovered a plaster deposit beneath the lagoon. The existence of this deposit prevents the lagoon to drain. Currently the lagoon has become an issue of political concern due to its polluted water that worsened during the past years on account of the lack of sound policies to prevent this situation.

== Sports ==
The Olympics of the Salado Basin take place every year in Lobos. This event began in 1974.

== Economy ==
Lobos&#x27;s economy is mostly agricultural and industrial. 

In terms of agriculture, wheat, maize and soybeans are concentrated, representing the latter 60 per cent of the hectares planted. About 50% of all beekeeping in Argentina is done in Buenos Aires, of which Lobos produces a large part.

<text>Birmingham International is a railway station known by code &quot;BHI&quot; in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull in the West Midlands of England, just east of Birmingham. It is on the Rugby–Birmingham–Stafford line east of Birmingham New Street railway station. BHI serves Birmingham Airport, the National Exhibition Centre, the Resorts World Arena, and Resorts World Birmingham.

==History==
The station was designed by the architect Ray Moorcroft and opened on 26 January 1976; it has regular train services to many parts of the country. It was named Birmingham International after the adjacent airport, which had at the time that name but is today called simply Birmingham Airport. A large space under the overbridge next to the southbound platforms suggests an allowance for future station expansion. 

In 2016, it was proposed to rename it to &quot;Birmingham Airport &amp; NEC&quot;, due to the airport&#x27;s name change and the near presence of the National Exhibition Centre.

==Services==
The station is managed by Avanti West Coast and is also served by CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains. It has five platforms, consisting of two islands and one side platform numbered 1–5 from south to north.
The basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:

Avanti West Coast:

* 2tph to (1 calling at , and ). All services call at .

**1tph extends northbound to via and .
***2 trains per day (tpd) run further to only, with 1 train every 2 hours running to (6tpd) and 4 trains per day (tpd) running to Glasgow Central. Services to Scotland run via .

At peak times some Avanti West Coast services to/from London Euston start and terminate here.

==Connection to Birmingham Airport==
A maglev service ran from the airport terminal to the station from 1984 until 1995. The train &quot;flew&quot; at an altitude of 15 mm over a track 620 m in length. It operated for nearly 11 years, but was scrapped because spare parts for the system were no longer available. It was temporarily replaced by a bus.

The chosen replacement system, the Doppelmayr Cable Car Cable Liner Shuttle, was announced in late 2000 and construction started in 2001. The Interchange was opened in March 2003. The system was originally known as &quot;SkyRail&quot; but in 2004 it was renamed AirRail Link.

The airport can also be reached via a dedicated fast bus service from Coleshill Parkway station, on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line.

==Connection to the National Exhibition Centre==
Undercover walkways, escalators and travelators connect the NEC buildings to the station and to the Air-Rail Link which, in turn, connects to Birmingham Airport.

==Birmingham Interchange==

A new Birmingham Interchange is to be built on the other side of the M42 motorway from the station to link it with the proposed High Speed 2 rail line. The new interchange would be connected to the station by an automated people mover, as well as to the airport and National Exhibition centre; the AirRail Link people mover already operates between Birmingham International station and the airport.

<doc id="253603" wikidata="Q30594" url="?curid=253603" title="Constantine IX Monomachos">
<text>Constantine IX Monomachos (; 980/ 1000
– 11 January 1055) reigned as Byzantine emperor from June 1042 to January 1055. Empress Zoë Porphyrogenita chose him as a husband and co-emperor in 1042, although he had been exiled for conspiring against her previous husband, Emperor Michael IV the Paphlagonian. The couple shared the throne with Zoë&#x27;s sister Theodora Porphyrogenita. Zoë died in 1050, and Constantine continued his collaboration with Theodora until his own death five years later. 

Constantine&#x27;s reign was marked by prodigality, enjoying an abundant imperial treasury following the conquests of his predecessors and the era of economic expansion that the Empire experienced in the first half of the 11th century. While Zoe was deprived of access to this treasure by Romanus III and then Michael IV, her third husband ensured that she could enjoy it as much as she wanted. He also distributed a large number of gifts, both in monetary forms and through donations of land or tax exemptions, especially for the religious world. He made all his decisions with the knowledge and approval of Zoe and Theodora, whether it was an act or an appearance. They were by his side in all ceremonies and their names were included along with his in public praises.

Constantine waged wars against groups which included the Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Pechenegs and, in the East, the rising Seljuq Turks. Despite the varying success of these campaigns, the Byzantine Empire largely retained the borders established after the conquests of Basil II (), even expanding eastwards when Constantine annexed the wealthy Armenian kingdom of Ani. Constantine accordingly may be considered the last effective emperor during the Macedonian Renaissance.

In 1054, a year before Constantine&#x27;s death, the Great Schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches took place, culminating in Pope Leo IX excommunicating the Patriarch Michael Keroularios. Constantine, aware of the political and religious consequences of such a disunion, made unsuccessful efforts to prevent the breach.

==Early life==
Constantine Monomachos was the son of Theodosios Monomachos, an important bureaucrat under Basil II and Constantine VIII, of the famous and noble Monomachos family. His mother and her name are unknown. Constantine was born around 980 or 1000 in Antioch. At some point Constantine&#x27;s father Theodosios had been suspected of conspiracy, and his son&#x27;s career suffered accordingly. Constantine&#x27;s position improved after he married his second wife, sometimes called Helena or Pulcheria, a daughter of Basil Skleros, and niece of Emperor Romanos III Argyros. Catching the eye of Empress Zoë Porphyrogenita, he was exiled to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos by her second husband, Emperor Michael IV.
The death of Michael IV and the overthrow of Michael V in 1042 led to Constantine being recalled from his place of exile and appointed as a judge in Greece. However, before he could commence his appointment, Constantine was summoned to Constantinople, where the fragile working relationship between Michael V&#x27;s successors, Empresses Zoë and Theodora Porphyrogenita, was breaking down. After two months of increasing acrimony between the two, Zoë decided to search for a new husband, thereby hoping to prevent her sister from increasing her popularity and authority.

After her first preference displayed contempt for the empress and her second died under mysterious circumstances, Zoë remembered the handsome and urbane Constantine. The pair were married on 11 June, without the participation of Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople, who refused to officiate over a third marriage (for both spouses). Constantine was crowned on the following day.

==Reign==

Constantine continued the purge instituted by Zoë and Theodora, removing the relatives of Michael V from the court. The new emperor was pleasure-loving and prone to violent outbursts on suspicion of conspiracy. He was heavily influenced by his controversial wife or mistress, Maria Skleraina, a relative of his second wife, and Maria&#x27;s family. Constantine had another mistress, an &quot;Alan princess&quot;, Gurandukht, likely the daughter of George I. 
In August 1042 Constantine relieved the general George Maniakes from his command in Italy, and Maniakes rebelled, declaring himself emperor in September. He transferred his troops into the Balkans and was about to defeat Constantine&#x27;s army in battle, when he was wounded and died on the field, ending the crisis in 1043.

Immediately after the victory, Constantine was attacked by a fleet from Kievan Rus&#x27;; it is &quot;incontrovertible that a Rus&#x27; detachment took part in the Maniakes rebellion&quot;. They too were defeated, with the help of Greek fire. As part of the peace negotiations, Constantine married his daughter, Anastasia (by his second wife or Maria Skleraina), to the future Prince Vsevolod I of Kiev, the son of his opponent Yaroslav I the Wise. Constantine&#x27;s family name &quot;Monomachos&quot; (&quot;one who fights alone&quot;) was inherited by Vsevolod and Anastasia&#x27;s son, Vladimir II Monomakh.

Constantine IX&#x27;s preferential treatment of Maria Skleraina in the early part of his reign led to rumors that she was planning to murder Zoë and Theodora. This led to a popular uprising by the citizens of Constantinople in 1044, which came dangerously close to harming Constantine as he participated in a religious procession. The mob was only quieted by the appearance at a balcony of Zoë and Theodora, who reassured the people that they were not in any danger of regicide.
In 1045, Constantine annexed the Armenian kingdom of Ani, but this expansion merely exposed the empire to new enemies. In 1046 the Byzantines first came into contact with the Seljuk Turks. They met in battle in Armenia in 1048 and settled a truce the following year. Even if the Seljuk rulers were willing to abide by the treaty, their unruly Turcoman allies showed much less restraint. The Byzantine forces would suffer a cataclysmic defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Constantine began persecuting the Armenian Church, trying to force it into union with the Orthodox Church. In 1046, he refounded the University of Constantinople by creating the Departments of Law and Philosophy.

In 1047, Constantine was faced by the rebellion of his nephew Leo Tornikios, who gathered supporters in Adrianople and was proclaimed emperor by the army. Tornikios was forced to retreat, failed in another siege, and was captured during his flight. The revolt had weakened Byzantine defenses in the Balkans, and in 1048 the area was raided by the Pechenegs, who continued to plunder it for the next five years. The emperor&#x27;s efforts to contain the enemy through diplomacy merely exacerbated the situation, as rival Pecheneg leaders clashed on Byzantine ground, and Pecheneg settlers were allowed to live in compact settlement in the Balkans, making it difficult to suppress their rebellion.

Constantine seems to have taken recourse to the &quot;pronoia&quot; system, a sort of Byzantine feudal contract in which tracts of land (or the tax revenue from it) were granted to particular individuals in exchange for contributing to and maintaining military forces. Constantine could be wasteful with the imperial treasury. On one occasion he is said to have sent an Arab leader 500,000 gold coins, over two tons of gold.
In 1054 the centuries-old differences between the Eastern and Western churches led to their final separation. Legates from Pope Leo IX excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael Keroularios when Keroularios would not agree to adopt western church practices, and in return Keroularios excommunicated the legates. This sabotaged Constantine&#x27;s attempts to ally with the Pope against the Normans, who had taken advantage of the disappearance of Maniakes to take over Southern Italy.

Constantine tried to intervene, but he fell ill and died on 11 January of the following year. He was persuaded by his councillors, chiefly the &quot;logothetes tou dromou&quot; John, to ignore the rights of the elderly Theodora, daughter of Constantine VIII, and to pass the throne to the &quot;doux&quot; of Bulgaria, Nikephoros Proteuon. However, Theodora was recalled from her retirement and named empress. 

== Architecture and art ==
The literary circle at the court of Constantine IX included the philosopher and historian Michael Psellos, whose &quot;Chronographia&quot; records the history of Constantine&#x27;s reign. Psellos left a physical description of Constantine in his &quot;Chronographia&quot;: he was &quot;ruddy as the sun, but all his breast, and down to his feet... [were] colored the purest white all over, with exquisite accuracy. When he was in his prime, before his limbs lost their virility, anyone who cared to look at him closely would surely have likened his head to the sun in its glory, so radiant was it, and his hair to the rays of the sun, while in the rest of his body he would have seen the purest and most translucent crystal.&quot;

Immediately upon ascending to the throne in 1042, Constantine IX set about restoring the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which had been substantially destroyed in 1009 by Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. Byzantine Emperor Romanos III had secured the right to undertake such a restoration in a treaty with al-Hakim&#x27;s son al-Zahir, but it was Constantine who finally set the project in motion, funding the reconstruction of the Church and other Christian establishments in the Holy Land.

== Appearance and personality ==
Constantine was said to rival Achilles and Nireus in terms of beauty. He was described by Michael Psellos as &quot;a marvel of beauty that Nature brought into being in the person of this man, so justly proportioned, so harmoniously fashioned, that there was no one in our time to compare to him&quot;. Psellos described &quot;the symmetry of the emperor&#x27;s body, his perfect analogies, his ruddy hair which shone like rays of sunlight, [and] his white body which appeared like clear and translucent crystal&quot;. 

In addition to his beauty, Constantine was praised for his justice and wisdom, the latter being displayed through his patronage of philosophy and rhetoric, as well as his legislation. Indeed, during his reign there was a &quot;rennaisance&quot; of interest in ancient Greek philosophy. His personality has been described as good-natured; he was easily amused and loved to laugh. He charmed practically everyone who knew him, especially Zoë, whom he enthralled immediately. Constantine spent money without restraints and liked to make several luxurious gifts to his associates. For example, he gave to the Church many objects of great value, including precious sacred vessels, &quot;that surpassed by far all the others as to dimensions, beauty and price&quot;. Constantine also showed clemency and mercy, even in cases of treason.

<text>The Chalmers Motor Company was an American automobile manufacturer headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. Founded in 1908 by Hugh Chalmers, the company was known for producing high-end vehicles. Chalmers automobiles gained recognition for their toughness, durability, and engineering receiving particular praise for their performance in touring events. The company reached its peak in 1911, becoming the eighth-largest auto producer in the United States. Despite initial success, the company faced challenges with increasing competition in the auto industry, and sales began to decline in the following years. In 1923, Chalmers Motor Company merged with Maxwell Motor, ultimately forming the basis for the Chrysler Corporation.

==History==

=== Origin ===

Hugh Chalmers started working at National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio, at age 14 and eventually became vice president. In 1907, car-maker Roy Chapin at Thomas-Detroit began to make offers to Hugh Chalmers to take over the company. Roy Chapin was concerned about the Thomas-Detroit&#x27;s reliance on the company&#x27;s sales network. Chapin persuaded Chalmers to become president of Thomas-Detroit and build a solid independent sales force. Hugh Chalmers purchased ER Thomas&#x27;s interests in the Thomas-Detroit company.

Chalmers convinced NCR salesman Joseph Fields to join him in Detroit to set up dealerships across the U.S. In 1907 or 1909, Chalmers built a factory on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit which would survive until 1991 under Chrysler while the headquarters was in Highland Park, Michigan.

The stockholders voted to rename the company the Chalmers-Detroit Motor Company on June 15, 1908, and later the Chalmers Motor Company on January 26, 1910.

The first car was the Chalmers 30 in 1908. Sales of 3,047 automobiles resulted in revenues of $4,754,929 and profits of $1,015,823 for the year ending June 30, 1909, although the paid-in capital stock was just $300,000.

In the early years of the Chalmers automobile brand, specifically in 1909 and 1910, the company produced a model called the Chalmers Detroit. Production during these two years was not high, and it was not until 1911 that the Chalmers car was officially introduced. The Chalmers Detroit cars were known for their toughness and durability, and they won 69 major competitions during their production period. One of the notable competitions won by the Chalmers Detroit was the Indiana Cup, and another was the 1910 Glidden tour, where a Model 30 car achieved victory. These early Chalmers cars, particularly the Model 30 and Model 40, were praised for their engineering and performance, and they continue to be regarded as some of the best cars for touring events. Notably, the Model T Ford, which was produced from 1908 to 1927, used the same oil in both its crankcase and transmission case, a design that did not cause any bearing problems and was similar to that of the Chalmers Detroit.

===Hudson Motor Car Company===
Roscoe Jackson and Howard Dunham, two of Howard Coffin&#x27;s employees at Oldsmobile, built a new lightweight car, the Model 20, intended to sell for under $1,000. Still, Chapin and Coffin could not persuade Hugh Chalmers to join the project. Chalmers Motors&#x27; early success was due primarily due to Roy Chapin as Treasurer and general manager, and Howard Coffin as Chief Engineer.

On October 28, 1908, Chapin, Coffin, and others formed the Hudson Motor Car Company to pursue their desires to build a smaller car. Roscoe Jackson was married to the niece of Detroit department store mogul Joseph L. Hudson. Hudson invested $90,000 in the endeavor and gave the company his name.
Hugh Chalmers was also a prominent investor in Hudson.

In 1909–10, Hugh Chalmers and his partners sold their shares in Hudson to Chapin, and Chapin sold his stake in Chalmers Motors to Hugh Chalmers. Hudson built a factory across the street from the Chalmers plant to be close to suppliers and the railroad.

In December 1909, the Chalmers and Hudson companies parted ways. Chapin&#x27;s concerns about the Chalmers firm&#x27;s future were well-founded; over the next decade, the Hudson company prospered while the Chalmers company faltered.

=== Peak sales ===

Chalmers&#x27;s best year was 1911 when it became the number eight auto producer in the U.S. The high point in sales was in 1911 when Chalmers sold 6,250 cars. Chalmers shareholders also did well. Preferred stock dividends paid out 7% per year and the common stock paid 2.5% annually.

Beginning in 1912, sales of Chalmers fell. Hugh Chalmers created Saxon Motors in 1913. From 1908 until 1913, the Chalmers Model 30&#x27;s design remained unchanged, even as its price climbed past $2,000 per unit. Despite this, Chalmers was the ninth-largest vehicle manufacturer in the United States in 1910, with 6,350 cars sold.

By 1915 the auto-business was changing and became more competitive. The Chalmers survival was always at risk with over 250 automakers in the U.S.

Before World War I, the automobile economy was booming, but sales of Chalmers&#x27; cars were declining.

In 1915, the Chalmers Motor Company produced 9,833 automobiles before being renamed the Chalmers Motor Car Corporation. Hugh Chalmers was a superb salesman, but once Roy Chapin and his partners defected to Hudson, he could not attract and retain skilled, active engineers and manufacturing employees.

In November 1915, Chalmers presented his 1916 models to his dealers and sold 13,000 automobiles worth $22 million in less than an hour.

By the end of 1915, the company had over $8 million in real estate and machinery and employed between 7,000 and 8,000 people. According to one publication, Chalmers earned more than $1 million in 1915.

Because it was a low-volume, high-cost manufacturer, the Chalmers Motor Company struggled to stay afloat. In 1910–1914, the company produced about 6,200 vehicles per year, then boosted production to 9,833 units in 1915 and 21,408 cars in 1916.

In 1916, Chalmers set up a Canadian factory in Walkerville (Windsor), Ontario.
At first, engines were manufactured by three outside suppliers, but Chalmers brought later engine manufacturing in-house. An advantage of the new Chalmers plant was its self-sufficiency.

The plant had a foundry to make engines, transmissions, axles, nuts, and bolts
Chalmers wanted to make as many parts in-house and only bought specialized parts like sparkplugs and tires from outside suppliers.

Hugh Chalmers proposed in May 1916 that the corporation boost production to 60,000 automobiles per year while lowering prices or raising prices while lowering output. The actual results attained in 1916 demonstrate the company&#x27;s issues. In the first half of the year, the Chalmers factory increased production, and the sales department supplied automobiles to dealers regardless of demand. As a result, a year&#x27;s worth of cars was on hand at Chalmers distributors in Dallas and Omaha. Nevertheless, Hugh Chalmers was obliged to reduce production from 15,659 automobiles in the first half of 1916 to only 5,749 in the second. As a result, Chalmers remained a struggling automotive manufacturer with extra plant capacity from 1910 to 1917.

The company&#x27;s finances improved in mid-1916 with better engine performance and improved body design, and the company moved from 14th to 12th place, but by late 1916 the company was close to bankruptcy.

===Merger with Maxwell Motors===

Beginning September 1, 1917, the Maxwell Motor Company bailed Chalmers by leasing its plants for five years. Maxwell received $3 million in operating capital from the Chalmers Motor Company, issuing $3.15 million in mortgage bonds.

When the U.S. entered World War 1, demand weakened for the Chalmers while the Maxwell cars were outselling them. In 1917, Chalmers agreed to make Maxwell cars in the Chalmers&#x27; Jefferson Avenue plant while Maxwell would sell Chalmers cars through their dealer network.

Maxwell decided to keep the Chalmers car in production to preserve its good name and reputation. Maxwell also committed to pay the interest on the mortgage bonds and to contribute half of the net profits made on all autos produced in the Chalmers factories to the Chalmers firm. Hugh Chalmers moved up and out to become chairman of the board, and Walter E. Flanders, already president of the Maxwell Motor Company, became president of Chalmers. From 1917 until 1922, the Maxwell and Chalmers corporations shared the same managers, but the companies did not fully merge until 1922. Maxwell built the Chalmers line of automobiles until 1923.

Hugh Chalmers left for Washington, D.C., to work with the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce (NACC) as one of the &quot;dollar a-year-men&quot;.
During 1917, following the April United States Declaration of War against Germany, Maxwell Motor Co took over Chalmers&#x27; operations to make cars and trucks for the U.S. Government. Chalmers merged with the Maxwell automobile Company in 1922.

When Hugh Chalmers returned to Detroit in 1919, both companies now had financial problems, and in mid-1920, the bank creditors formed a reorganization committee. In 1920, Walter P. Chrysler joined the Maxwell automobile company and faced numerous challenges, one of which was the unsuccessful merger with Chalmers. Subsequently, due to mechanical issues that had negatively impacted Maxwell&#x27;s reputation, the company revamped and rebranded the vehicle as the &quot;Good Maxwell&quot;.

In late November 1921, Chalmers reduced prices for all models, and production was down to about 20 cars a day while Maxwell was selling more than 100 vehicles a day. Walter P. Chrysler reorganized the company and finally merged them into Chrysler in 1923.

Chase National Bank at that time had recruited the help of Walter P. Chrysler to rescue Willys Overland Company and Chalmers.
Chalmers and Maxwell sued each other for millions of dollars. The Chalmers-Maxwell reorganization committee found that the lease agreement was too loose and poorly constructed.

Chrysler&#x27;s financial and management overhaul of Maxwell in 1920–1922 was hindered by delays in Maxwell&#x27;s takeover of Chalmers, which began in 1917. The convoluted strands of the Maxwell-Chalmers relationship are difficult to summarize. The original lease became increasingly unfavorable for Maxwell&#x27;s shareholders as Chalmers&#x27; fortunes dropped after 1917 and Maxwell&#x27;s performance improved. Maxwell was losing money on the Chalmers brand while splitting revenues from the more profitable Maxwell automobile with Chalmers investors. Both company&#x27; investors agreed to alter the original lease and merge the two companies. Still, the merger was delayed due to opposition by some Chalmers stockholders and threats of lawsuits.

Maxwell and Chalmers were hurt by a lack of material and rising costs after the war.

Walter Chrysler had the difficult task of reviving both Maxwell and Chalmers. In 1920, Chalmers&#x27; sales (almost 10,000 automobiles) were about a third of Maxwell&#x27;s (34,000 cars), but by 1921, when Maxwell&#x27;s sales had dropped to 16,000, Chalmers had only sold about 3,000 vehicles. As a result, Chalmers produced only 3,978 automobiles in 1922, a dismal performance compared to Maxwell&#x27;s robust sales of 48,883 cars.
In 1921, Maxwell stopped producing cars in the Chalmers plant.

For the calendar year 1922, Maxwell had a profit of $2,018,266; however, Chalmers&#x27; losses for the year ($1,325,524) decreased Maxwell&#x27;s net profit to barely $700,000. A U.S. District Court judgment issued November 3, 1922, settled a lawsuit launched by the Fisk Rubber Company against Chalmers, ending the long-running feud between the Chalmers and Maxwell investors.

The court declared the Chalmers company bankrupt and ordered its assets to be auctioned off. On December 7, 1922, the Maxwell Motor Corporation purchased the Chalmers property for $1,987,600, completing a takeover that began in 1917.

The last Chalmers branded car was probably produced in January 1924. The old Chalmers plant started to produce Chryslers in 1924, but Chrysler produced Maxwell cars until 1925.

==Models==

===&quot;Forty&quot;===
 The 1908 Model C &quot;Forty&quot; was similar to the Thomas-Detroit C &quot;Forty&quot; from the previous year, which was very similar to the vehicle designed by Howard Coffin, the 1906 Olds Model &quot;A&quot;.

The engines were manufactured by other companies such as Westinghouse Machine Company, American, British Manufacturing Company, and Continental. In 1911 Chalmers started building most of its engines. The &quot;Forty&quot; engine&#x27;s small radiator led to overheating.

The 40 Touring or Roadster sold for US$2750 while the 40 Torpedo sold for US$3000. This was less than American&#x27;s lowest-price Model, which sold for US$4250.

===&quot;30&quot; and &quot;36&quot;===

The &quot;30&quot; remained more or less the same, but the &quot;36&quot; (introduced in 1912) had a longer stroke and higher horsepower four-cylinder engine.

Nickel plate replaced the brass in cars as it was easier to maintain, and Gray &amp; Davis electric headlights replaced the gas headlights.
Chalmers produced only one truck type in its history and called it the Model 14 Delivery.

The Model &quot;36&quot; has a 4-speed transmission. The foot brake is combined with the clutch pedal, so it releases the clutch when pushed halfway.

The 30 Touring and the 30 Roadster sold for US$1500, when the Oldsmobile Runabout was priced at US$650, the Cole 30 sold for US$1500, and the Oakland 40 went for US$1600. The 30 Coupe at US$2400 was nearer the Enger 40 car at US$2400.

=== &quot;Six&quot;, &quot;Light-6&quot; and &quot;Master Six&quot; ===
The first 6-cylinder was introduced in 1912 and called the Model 12 &quot;Six&quot;. The company added a &quot;Master Six&quot; in September 1913 and &quot;Light Six&quot; at a New York show in January 1914. George Dunham developed the six cylinders. The &quot;Light Six&quot; and &quot;Master Six&quot; have a redesigned engine, clutch, and dashboard.

The &quot;Six&quot; Model Series Models 12 and 18 had overhead intake valves and a Rayfield carburetor. As a high-end car, the Six came with an engine-driven tire pump and a compressed air starting system.

===Master Six Model 24===

Important improvements made their appearance in the Model 24. The Model 24, 7 passenger car, weighed 5475 pounds.

==== Engine ====
Model 24 was the first Chalmer&#x27;s engine to use a long-stroke T-head, and the company claimed that it could not be stalled as it used a chain that ran with the engine that would restart the machine when it was about to stall. The exhausts were on the right, the intakes on the left, and the enclosed valve functioning elements contributed to the motor&#x27;s silent operation.

The motor was brand new, and it came with T-head cylinders, an electric starter, a new forced-feed oiling system, and enclosed valve parts. The engine and the gearset were still one unit. One set of disks in the multiple-disk clutch featured cork inserts. The torsion rods were redesigned, and the rear springs were lowered. For the first time in a Chalmers model, the steering wheel was shifted to the left side, with the levers in the center. Also for the first time, the gasoline tank was carried in the back and fed by a pressure feed. The spare rims or wheels are kept in the back of the vehicle. 
It had a slightly smaller motor, a 2-inch larger wheelbase, and was $225 less in roadster and four and five-passenger models; $325 less in six-passenger models; $100 less as a limousine; and $50 more as a coupe when compared to the 1913 six. In addition, on the 1913 model, the new Chalmers-Entz combined electric starting and lighting system replaced the air starting method, and a single bosch ignition replaced the prior dual types ignition.

The cylinders in groups of three were castings with water-jacket spaces around the cylinders and around the valve seats and partly surrounding the valve stem guides. The jacket heads were built into the water heater or return pipe to the radiator as one piece and in the head of the combustion chamber was a 2 3/8-inch threaded plug which when removed gave access to the entire combustion chamber for carbon removal without removing the cylinder castings. The water entered each cylinder group&#x27;s rear face, which was the hottest section.The cylinder had a bore of 4 inches and stroke of 5.5 inches which gave an S.A.E. rating of 38.4 horsepower, a piston displacement of 414.7 cubic inches, and a stroke-bore ratio of 1.333 to 1.

The 24 was part of a trend toward long-stroke engines with smaller piston displacements, which provided more economy and more horsepower per unit of piston displacement. In addition, the connecting rods, which were produced of nickel steel instead of open hearth in 1913, were 40 percent lighter and had a narrower section.

Even though the pistons were longer than the previous year&#x27;s model, which was necessary by the longer strokes employed, they were lighter. In addition, they were higher-quality castings with four-section rings. Each slot had a complete outside ring, but inside it was a sequence of arc-shaped segments creating an inner ring. Each segment was forced externally by a small leaf spring, which was employed to keep the outer ring from pressing against the cylinder wall unevenly. The constant pressure obtained by this construction of piston ring results in good compression being maintained for a longer period than was possible with the older type. The 40 percent carbon crankshaft had curved cheeks that helped to move the weight into the middle of the shaft axis and provide optimum rotational balance. Three bronze plain bearings supported the shaft with a babbitt alloy liner.

Intake and exhaust valves were made of tungsten steel, which was also used in racing automobiles, helped prevent pitting. Both valve sets have a 7/16-inch lift and 85-pound pressure springs and are 2 1/8 inches in diameter. A new oiling system used a gear pump in the crankcase sump that fed oil to a large-diameter pipe that went from end to end and within the crankcase. Three branches led to the crankshaft bearings from this conduit.

Instead of flowing into the sump, the overflow oil from these bearings was sent out the opposite end of the bearing, where it entered through a short pipe and dropped into little trays integral with the sides of the crankcase base, where it flowed into the oil troughs beneath the connecting rods. The scoops on the connecting rods dipped into these troughs. The final overflow from the troughs was recirculated in the sump. On the left side of the crankcase, in the web between the front and rear legs, an upgraded form of accessible oil strainer was installed. Timing gears were oiled directly from the front bearing&#x27;s overflow via a short pipe that poured the oil onto the crankshaft&#x27;s pinion.

====Clutch Oiled from Motor====

The multiple-disk clutch was improved by inserting cork inserts in one set of disks and operating the entire clutch in oil. A torque rod upgrade supported the clutch at the forward end by a curved leaf vanadium steel spring, saving 25 pounds in weight over the previous model.

====Chassis====
The model 24 chassis came with a single wheelbase length and seven interchangeable body designs, all of which were held in place by eight small stamped brackets on the outside of the frame side members, four on each side. This mounting was created to decrease body squeaks and to make demounting easier.
The steering components on the front axle had a twofold tilt. The knuckle pins pointed slightly outward and there was a backward inclination of 1.5 to 2 degrees. The frame was 1/16 inch thicker and heavier than before. The side members were lowered in front of the back axle but not inswept at the dash. The front springs were 39 inches long with 2-inch leaves. The three-quarter rears were put beneath the axle not because it provided lower body suspension, but because it provided approximately double the spring movement radius. The top leaf was 52 inches long with 2 /14-inch leaves and was made of vanadium steel.

==== Chalmers-Entz Starting System ====
The Chalmers-Entz combination electric motor and generator was introduced in the Model 24 to crank the gasoline engine while also charging the storage battery. Instead of being mounted alongside the motor, the motor-generator was housed under the right front seat and was powered by a short propeller shaft that extended forward to the near rim of the flywheel and carried a small sprocket that was driven by a silent chain from a large sprocket on the flywheel. The generator was made in the Chalmers factory and was an 18-volt system. The complete unit was about 230 pounds in weight, 100 pounds for the motor-generator, 100 pounds for the battery, and 30 for the driving parts and attaching brackets.

====Body====
As it converged into the cowl, the hood was expanded and heightened. The hood transition into the body was made easier by turning off the dash lights and replacing them with a combination headlight that featured two bulbs, one for headlights and the other for dash lights, located above the lens exits.

====Price and options====
The roadster, four and five-passenger bodies were priced at $2,175, the six-passenger at $2,275, the coupe at $2,850, and the limousine at $3,680. In addition, $80 was fitted with McCue wire wheels. A $75 package that featured a Kellog tire pump, an extra rim casing, tube, and tire cover was also available. Mohair top, rain vision windshield, demountable rims, speedometer, rear tire carrier with spare rim, electric horn, electric starter, and electric lighting were all on the normal list. Brewster green, grey, and meteor blue were the standard colors for open cars. Closed automobiles were only available in the color valentine coach blue.

=== Model 26 ===
The Model 26-A came with a smaller engine and better performance being a lighter car.


=== Model 32 &quot;Six-40&quot; ===
The Model 32-A &quot;Six-40&quot; was the company&#x27;s first overhead camshaft engine.

The engine was a Weidely Motor Company with its overhead camshaft (OHC) design. 
When comparing these later OHC Chalmers power plants to the T head or L head engines of the pre-World War I period, their specifications cannot be ignored. The Chalmers&#x27; two-roller-bearing-crankshaft F-head engine of 1910 had been a surprising performer, with a streamlined intake manifold feeding the cylinders via extremely large intake valves located in the head. The exhaust side valves were in a pocket, leaving a lot of room in the cylinder head for the inlets. In 1915, Chalmers made a great step forward with the incorporation of a full-overhead-camshaft Weidley engine, which pioneered the idea of driving the overhead-camshaft from the middle of the crankshaft instead of from the front or the rear. The model 6-40 had a bore and stroke of 3.125 and 5 inches, respectively, and camshaft rigidity was obtained by using a 2.25-inch diameter. The location of the camshaft drive in the center made it necessary to have four main bearings instead of the usual three. Tubular connecting rods were also used, which was a very advanced idea for its day.

===&quot;Six-30&quot;/ &quot;Y&quot;===
The &quot;Six-30&quot; consisted of Models 35-A (&quot;5-15&quot; for 5 passenger and 115-inch wheelbase), 35-B (or &quot;7-22&quot; for 7-passenger body and 122-inch wheelbase), 35-C, and 35-D.
The car&#x27;s balanced crankshaft and a new Morse silent timing chain gave it a reputation for a quiet and smooth ride. Later designs introduced a lower silhouette, one-piece windshield, and even disc wheels.

To overcome the poor fuel available at the time, the &quot;Hot Spot&quot; and &quot;Ram&#x27;s Horn&quot; were introduced in 1918 to improve engine performance. The &quot;Six-30&quot; came in a wide variety of body styles and wheelbases to seat between 2 and 7 passengers.


====&quot;Hot Spot&quot; and &quot;Ram&#x27;s Horn&quot; innovation====
Chalmers introduced two mechanical devices in 1917 to overcome lower gasoline volatility. The &quot;Hot Spot&quot; and &quot;Ram&#x27;s Horn&quot; warmed up the air-fuel mixture.

==== Four wheel brakes ====
In late 1923 customers could purchase the Model Y with an optional hydraulic four-wheel brake system for $75 based on hydraulics that had been initially developed for Lockheed.

==== Lucile Sedan ====
The couturière, costumier, journalist, and pundit, Lucy Duff-Gordon lent her name to advertising for brassieres, perfume, shoes, and other luxury apparel and beauty items. In 1916 she signed a contract to design interiors for limousines and town cars for the 1917 Chalmers Model 35-B. The design was an attempt to improve sales by marketing a more luxurious design. The Town car had no protection for the driver and the sedan had removable door posts to create a look of an open hard top. Duff-Gordon had little other interest in the exterior and focused on improved interior materials such as a mahogany dash and finer cloth.

== Racing ==

Chalmers marketed the company&#x27;s visibility by hiring professional drivers and entering races. In the first two years, they won 89 first place wins, 32-second-place trophies, 21 third-place victories in road races, and hill-climbing events, and reliability contests. The best known as the Vanderbilt Cup in 1909 and the Glidden Trophy in 1910.

The Chalmers &quot;30&quot; won more motoring contests in proportion to the number entered than any other car regardless of price. It was never defeated in any race by any car in the same power and price class.
The Chalmers won 89 firsts, 32 seconds, and 21 thirds in two years of races.

A Chalmers won the 1909 and 1910 Glidden Tour. Other wins included the Vanderbilt Cup Races (1909), Crown Point Races, Candler Trophy Races, and Pikes Peak hill climb.

===Chalmers racing records===

1909 Indiana Trophy Race
Chalmers &quot;30&quot; was first, winning the Indiana Trophy
on the Crown Point-Lowell circuit-232.74 miles at an average time of 51.5 miles per hour.

Santa Monica, California
Chalmers &quot;30&quot; won first in 200-mile race, averaging 55.5 miles per hour.
National Light Stock Car Event
Chalmers &quot;30&quot; won first place and the Merrimac Valley trophy in Lowell, Massachusetts-127.2 miles at an average time of 52 miles per hour.
Atlanta Georgia Speedway
In November 1909, two Chalmers &quot;30s&quot; won every event in their class. Both cars averaged a mile for every minute they were on track during the week of racing. They won first and second place and the Candler trophy in a 100-mile race. For the week. the Chalmers&#x27; tally was five firsts, 11 seconds, and eight-thirds-the best average showing made.

1909 Vanderbilt Race

Chalmers &quot;30&quot; won first in the race for Massapequa trophy-126 miles in 129 minutes without a single stop. This is the world&#x27;s speed record for cars of this type and has not been beaten since.

Denver-Mexico City
In May 1909, a Chalmers &quot;30&quot; made the trip a pathfinder for the &quot;Flag to Flag&quot; tour. This was the first car to make the trip on its power from the Rio Grande to Mexico City, running 2400 miles in 24 running days.
At the Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, a Chalmers &quot;Forty&quot; defeated one 90 horsepower, four 70 horsepower, and seven 60 horsepower cars. It was bested by only one car, a 90 horsepower of more than twice the price, and only four minutes. The &quot;Forty&quot; was awarded the Consistency Prize because it did not stop a single time during the 200-mile race.

A Chalmers won the Portland Rose Festival Race Wemme trophy and first place by a Chalmers &quot;Forty&quot; running 103 miles in 104 minutes.

A Chalmers won the Minneapolis Tribune Trophy in 1908, 1909 and 1910.

Chalmers produced six 1917 cars for racing. The engine had 55 horsepower, revved to 2600 rpm.

==Chalmers Award (1911–1914)==

Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball at the end of the season.

The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. Cobb had a .004 lead on Nap Lajoie for the American League batting title. Cobb won the title and the car. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race but Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players. Cobb enjoyed driving the car so much that he later requested a more streamlined racing vehicle from the company. Cobb was once assaulted by a gang of thieves in the streets of Detroit while riding in the Chalmers automobile. The approximate price of the car was around $1,500, and it was powered by an Inline 4 engine that produced 30 horsepower, featuring a 3-speed manual transmission

In 1911, Chalmers created the Chalmers Award. A committee of baseball writers was to convene after the season to determine the &quot;most important and useful player to the club and the league&quot;. Since the award was not as effective at advertising as Chalmers had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.

<text>Carthage College is a private college in Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States. Founded in 1847, it is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Carthage awards bachelor&#x27;s degrees with majors in more than 40 subject areas and master&#x27;s degrees in three areas. Carthage has 150 faculty and enrolls approximately 2,600 students. It is an affiliate of the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium.

==History==

Carthage College was founded in Hillsboro, Illinois, by Lutheran pioneers in education, and chartered by the Illinois General Assembly on January 22, 1847. Originally known as The Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church in the Far West, its name was soon shortened to Lutheran College and known locally as Hillsboro College. With a two-person faculty and 79 students, Hillsboro promised &quot;a course of study designed to be thorough and practical, and to embrace all the branches of learning, usually pursued in the best academies and colleges&quot;.

In 1852, the college moved to Springfield, Illinois, and was renamed Illinois State University, not to be confused with the institution in Normal, Illinois, under the same name. During this period Abraham Lincoln served briefly on the board of trustees from 1860 to 1861, while his son Robert Todd Lincoln was a student in Illinois State University&#x27;s preparatory academy from 1853 to 1859. Illinois State University&#x27;s enrollment dwindled during the Civil War and closed in 1868. In 1870, several faculty reestablished the college in the rural west-central city of Carthage, Illinois, where the college acquired its current name, Carthage College.

The Great Depression and World War II lowered enrollment to 131 students in 1943, but enrollment increased again after the war as a result of the G.I. Bill.

After years of financial challenges, shifts in Lutheran synodical support, and searches for a suitable location, Carthage&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously in 1957 to open a campus in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The lakeshore campus was dedicated on October 14, 1962.

By 1962, the college launched an era of growth. The next decade brought a period of continuous expansion. Enrollment increased fivefold, endowment tripled, and physical assets increased 600 percent. In fall 1995, Carthage enrolled 1,527 full-time students, setting a new record. Since 2001, the college has invested more than $130 million in new construction, major renovations, and technological acquisition.

===Expansion===
In 2001, the Hedberg Library opened its doors, adjoining the H. F. Johnson Center for the Fine Arts. The library won Wisconsin Library of the Year in 2004. The library also won the Highsmith Award in 2007 for Family Fun Night, a program for community members that encourages learning for children from 2 to 13. The former Ruthrauff Library was renovated into the A. W. Clausen Center for World Business, opening in 2004.

The Tarble Athletic and Recreation Center opened in 2001, and the former Physical Education Center was rebuilt and renamed the Tarble Arena, opening in 2009.

In fall 2011, a new student union opened on the site of the former W. F. Seidemann Natatorium. It houses a new press box, new bleachers, a new and larger bookstore, new dining options, a campus &quot;living room&quot;, a new dining room, a 200-seat theatre, an art gallery, and a gaming area. In April 2012 the student center was formally dedicated and named the Campbell Student Union in honor of retiring President F. Gregory Campbell and his wife, Barbara, for their 25 years of service to Carthage. President Campbell retired in August 2012.

The Oaks, a new student residence village overlooking Lake Michigan, opened in 2012, containing six villas with semi-private suites and a media lounge on each floor.

In fall 2015, a new science center opened in the newly renovated David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Natural and Social Sciences. Originally built in 1962, the former Science Hall was renovated and renamed in honor of David A. Straz, Jr., in 1995. The latest $45 million expansion added a new planetarium, twelve new science labs, new classrooms, faculty offices, and student gathering and exhibition spaces.

In fall 2018, the newest residence hall, The Tower, was opened. The Tower provides students with apartment-style suites with personal bathrooms, as well as media lounges on each floor and communal kitchens on every other floor. The new building also presented students with the Terrace, a new studying space with televisions, laptop bars, and a functioning fireplace.

===Tuition reset===
Undergraduate tuition for the 2019–2020 academic year was $45,100 (excluding books, personal expenditures, and health insurance). On September 17, 2019, the college announced that it was resetting the sticker price of tuition for the 2020–21 academic year by 30% to $31,500. The college made this decision in an effort to make its pricing more transparent and to attract students that may have been deterred by the high listed tuition.

===Admissions===
In fall 2016, Carthage had enrollment of 2,818 undergraduate students and 112 graduate students. The student body is 55 percent female and 45 percent male. 70% of applicants are accepted for admission. 

===Western Heritage===
All Carthage students were required to take Western Heritage, a year-long course sequence in which they read, discussed, and wrote about major Western texts. The reading list included works by Plato, Homer, Shakespeare, Thomas Jefferson, and W. E. B. DuBois, in addition to the Bible. In the 2020–2021 school year, this was replaced with Intellectual Foundations, which has the same purpose but includes more texts written by non-white authors.

===Senior thesis===
All students must complete a senior thesis. This capstone project can take the form of a research project, music recital, art exhibit, or some other original demonstration of scholarship or creativity.

===January term===
During January Term, known on campus as &quot;J-Term&quot;, participating students select one class and attend it daily. In addition to on-campus courses, many students travel with faculty on study tours in either January or the summer months. Destinations in 2016 included Cuba, Nicaragua, and World War II battle sites in Europe. All students must complete two J-Term courses, including one during their freshman year.

===Rankings===
Carthage College was tied for 37th among Regional Universities Midwest in the 2025 U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings of Best Colleges..

The Institute for International Education placed Carthage no. 4 among baccalaureate institutions for student participation in short-term study abroad in 2013–2014.

In &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;&#x27;s 2016 rankings, Carthage was among 159 schools listed as a Best Midwestern College.

From 2008 through 2016, 17 students from the college won Fulbright fellowships. In 2016, the college was named a top Fulbright producer.

===Faculty===
The college has a student-to-faculty ratio of 13 to 1. In fall 2016, the college employed 160 full-time professors and 162 part-time faculty members. In the summer of 2020, the college announced a plan to reduce &quot;total full-time faculty by 10 to 20 percent. That reduction would include a mix of tenured and contract faculty.&quot; It is to be effected via a &quot;reorganization&quot; affecting ten departments, including Biology, Classics, English, Modern Languages, Music, Philosophy and Great Ideas, Physics and Astronomy, Political Science, Religion, and Sociology and Criminal Justice. In fall 2021, the college employed 142 full-time professors and 145 part-time faculty members.

===Carthage in Chicago===
In 2014, the college launched the Carthage in Chicago program. Participating students spend a semester in Chicago, securing an internship or pursuing a major academic project while living and taking classes in the city. Housing and classroom space are located at HI-Chicago.

==Traditions==

===The Old Main Bell===
For decades, the Old Main Bell sat in the tower at the top of Old Main, the first building on the campus in Carthage, Illinois. After athletic victories, students would race down Evergreen Walk to ring the bell. When Carthage moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in the 1960s, the Tau Sigma Chi fraternity helped move the victory bell to Kenosha. In 2004, the victory bell found a new home in the scoreboard on Art Keller Field.

===Kissing Rock===
Kissing Rock has been a part of Carthage since 1913. Dennis Swaney and other members of the Class of 1913 found the 2 ½-ton chunk of granite in a farmer&#x27;s field and moved the stone to the campus.
Stationed prominently at the entrance to Evergreen Walk, the rock quickly became part of Carthage life. One tradition recounts that any woman sitting on the rock was obligated to kiss the man who found her there and countless marriage proposals have been made and accepted near it. Members of the Beta Phi Epsilon fraternity moved Kissing Rock to the Kenosha campus in the mid-1960s. It now sits facing Lake Michigan between Lentz and Tarble Halls.

Today, Kissing Rock is a multifaceted symbol of the Carthage spirit. Students paint the Rock to promote their organizations and causes, publicize upcoming events, and celebrate. Kissing Rock has served as a memorial to beloved alumni, an expression of protest against injustice, a tribute after 9/11, and more.

===Christmas Festival===
The Christmas Festival has been a part of Carthage&#x27;s holiday season since 1974. Every year at the start of December, Carthage hosts a musical celebration of the birth of Christ for the community. The event highlights student vocal and instrumental ensembles, as well as performances by students in Carthage&#x27;s Theatre Department.

==Athletics==
Carthage athletic teams are the Firebirds. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) since the 1961–62 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1946–47 to 1951–52. The Firebirds previously competed in the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1912–13 to 1940–41.

In men&#x27;s volleyball, Carthage became a founding member of the single-sport Continental Volleyball Conference (CVC) in 2011. In 2014, the CVC amicably split along regional lines, with Carthage and the CVC&#x27;s other Midwestern members forming the Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League. The team then moved into the CCIW once the conference began sponsoring men&#x27;s volleyball in 2020.

In women&#x27;s water polo, Carthage is a member of the single-sport Collegiate Water Polo Association Division III Conference since the team&#x27;s inception in 2010.

Carthage competes in 28 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, water polo and wrestling. In the spring of 2021, Carthage announced the creation of an e-sports team as a varsity sport.

Over a third of Carthage students are involved in varsity intercollegiate athletics, and another third participate in the many intramural and club sports offered. Club sports include men&#x27;s bowling, and co-ed curling and ice hockey.

===Volleyball===
The men&#x27;s volleyball team went undefeated in the 2021 spring season and went on to win the school&#x27;s first Division III National Championship. They repeated as champions in 2022, becoming the first sport to win back-to-back national championships at the college. They have been invited on several occasions, finishing 2nd in their very first year. In 2022 they were the hosts of the Division III Final Four, winning the National Championship on their home court.

===Baseball===
The men&#x27;s baseball team averaged over 35 wins per season from 1990 to 2010, with an overall record of 702–237. They have been invited to the NCAA Division III World Series several times, finishing third in 2009.

Since 1990, Carthage has claimed eight outright CCIW divisional titles, one divisional-title tie, nine conference crowns, 16 NCAA regional berths, including nine-straight from 1992 to 2000, six regional titles, third-place finishes in both the 1993 and 1994 NCAA Division III baseball championships and fourth place in both 1995 and 1997. For his efforts, Coach Augie Schmidt has been named American Baseball Coaches Association/Diamond Sports NCAA Division III Central Regional &quot;Coach Of The Year&quot; nine times (1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009), won the ABCA/Louisville Slugger Conference Award seven times from 1993 to 1999, and has been named CCIW &quot;Baseball Coach of the Year&quot; on 10 occasions (1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009).

===Football===
:&quot;See List of Carthage Firebirds head football coaches&quot;

In 2004, Carthage&#x27;s football team set a school record for most wins in a season, going 11–2. That season was also the first time the Red Men made the NCAA Division III playoffs since the school joined the NCAA in 1976. The team was coached by Tim Rucks. Carthage went on to win their first two games of the playoffs defeating Alma College and Wooster College. The Red Men then lost to Mount Union College. The Red Men finished the 2004 season ranked 5th in the nation.

Mike Yeager served as the head coach beginning with the 2012 season and concluding in 2017. Dustin Hass has taken over the role since 2018.

===Nickname===
In 2005, the NCAA ruled that Carthage, along with several other colleges, would be ineligible to host NCAA-sanctioned playoffs and tournaments because their nickname, &quot;Redmen&quot;, was perceived as an offensive reference to Native Americans. A decision was made to rename the Carthage men&#x27;s teams the &quot;Red Men&quot;. This is in accordance with the circa 1920 origin of the name—the team&#x27;s red uniform jersey—while removing any possible controversial connotations. In conjunction with the rearticulation of the name, a new logo for the team replaced the traditional feathered Carthage C. It includes a torch, a shield, and a C.

In 2020, the Carthage Board of Trustees and Athletics voted unanimously to retire the Red Men/Lady Reds nickname and mascot &quot;Torchie&quot; from athletics. The teams will compete as Carthage Athletics for the 2020–2021 academic year with a new name and mascot approved and announced prior to the 2021–2022 academic year. On February 19, 2021, the Carthage Board of Trustees, along with President Swallow, voted to change the nickname to the Firebirds, and the new nickname was immediately adopted for all sports. At the Homecoming Football Game in October 2021, the Carthage team unveiled their new mascot, named &quot;Ember&quot;.

<doc id="253610" wikidata="Q37078" url="?curid=253610" title="Andronikos IV Palaiologos">
<text>Andronikos IV Palaiologos or Andronicus IV Palaeologus (; 11 April 1348 – 25/28 June 1385) was the eldest son of Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos. Appointed co-emperor from 1352, he had a troubled relationship with his father: he launched a failed rebellion in 1373, usurped the throne in 1376–1379, and remained engaged in a bitter struggle with his father, John V, until his death in 1385. This civil war depleted Byzantium&#x27;s scarce resources and greatly facilitated the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, most notably through the cession of Gallipoli by Andronikos. He was also the father of John VII.

==Life==
Born on 11 April 1348, Andronikos IV Palaiologos was the eldest son of Emperor John V Palaiologos by his wife Helena Kantakouzene. In 1352 he was already associated as co-emperor with his father, and when John V left for Italy in 1369 to affirm his submission to the Pope, John left Andronikos behind in Constantinople as regent, while his younger son Manuel II Palaiologos was sent to govern Thessalonica. 

During his stay in Italy, John attempted to settle his accounts with the Republic of Venice; this included not only John&#x27;s own loans, but also the loan of 30,000 ducats (and the associated interest) that his mother, Anna, had taken during the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347, with the Byzantine crown jewels as collateral. John went in person to Venice, but he lacked the funds to pay off the loans, or even to secure a ship for his voyage home. As a result, he proposed to cede to the Venetians the island of Tenedos, strategically located at the entrance of the Dardanelles, in exchange for further funds and six warships. The Venetians accepted, but when news reached Constantinople, Andronikos IV, likely urged by the Genoese, Venice&#x27;s commercial rivals, refused to honour his father&#x27;s agreement. This left John stranded in Venice, effectively as a captive debtor of the Republic; when he suggested that funds be raised to secure his release by selling precious objects from the churches, Andronikos again refused, claiming that this was impious. In the end, it was only the intervention of Manuel, who went from Thessalonica to Venice in person, that secured John&#x27;s release. It was not until October 1371 that the emperor returned to Constantinople. 

Andronikos IV rebelled when the Ottoman sultan Murad I forced John V into vassalage in 1373. On 6 May, Andronikos IV fled Constantinople and allied with Murad&#x27;s son Savcı Bey, who was rebelling against his own father. Both rebellions failed and Andronikos was imprisoned and blinded on 30 May, albeit only in one eye. His brother Manuel replaced him as heir. 

===Reign===

In July 1376, the Genoese helped Andronikos to escape from prison, whence he went straight to Sultan Murad I, and agreed to return Gallipoli in return for his support. Gallipoli had been retaken by the Byzantines ten years before, with the assistance of Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy; this strategically important bridgehead greatly improved the sultan&#x27;s ability to attack Europe. The sultan duly provided a mixed force of cavalry and infantry and with these, Andronikos was able to take control of Constantinople. Here he was able to capture and imprison both John V and his son Manuel.

However, he made the mistake of favouring the Genoese too highly by awarding them Tenedos. The governor there refused to hand it over, and passed it on to Venice. In the same year, 18 October 1377, he was crowned emperor and also crowned his young son John VII as co-emperor. However, in 1379 John and Manuel escaped to Sultan Murad, and with the assistance of the Venetians, overthrew Andronikos later in the year. The Venetians restored John V to the throne, and Manuel II. Andronikos fled to Galata, staying there until May 1381, when he was once again made co-emperor and heir to the throne despite his earlier treachery. Andronikos IV was also given the approaches to Constantinople with the city of Selymbria (Silivri) as his personal domain.

In 1385, he rebelled again, but died soon after, on 25 or 28 June, at Selymbria. He was buried in the Pantokrator Monastery in Constantinople.

==Family==
In 1356, Andronikos IV married Keratsa of Bulgaria, a daughter of Emperor Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria. The couple had one son, John VII Palaiologos.

<text>Paige was a Detroit, United States–based automobile company, selling luxury cars between 1908 and 1927.

==History==
Paige first began producing automobiles in 1908. The company&#x27;s first car was a two-seat model powered by a 2.2-liter three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. This model continued until 1910, when a four-stroke, four-cylinder engine design took over. In 1911, the company&#x27;s namesake was shortened to Paige. A six-cylinder model was added to the range in 1914. Four-cylinder models were dropped in 1916, leaving a choice of 3.7- or 4.9-liter sixes. Another name change occurred in 1919, when models fitted with a Duesenberg engine were known as Paige-Linwood, and models fitted with a Continental engine were listed as Paige-Larchmont. A straight-eight engine was added to the sixes in 1927.

On January 21, 1921, a Paige 6-66 broke an American stock car speed record by covering a mile in 35.01 seconds at a speed of 102.8 miles per hour.

The most notable Paige produced was the 1922-1926 Daytona, a 3-seat sports roadster with a 6-cylinder engine. The vehicle was a traditional coupe, with the novel third seat extending from the side of the car over the near side running board. Paige advertised the Daytona as being &quot;The most beautiful car in America.&quot;

Paige also produced less-expensive range of cars between 1923 and 1926. These were sold as Jewetts and were named for the Paige company president H. M. Jewett. For 1927, the Jewett name changed to Junior Paige.

==Graham ownership==
The Graham Brothers bought the company on June 10, 1927. Joseph Graham became the new president, his brothers Robert and Ray serving as vice-president and secretary-treasurer, respectively. The three, together with their father, also became directors of the company. The corporate name soon changed to Graham-Paige Motors Corporation. The market agreed, and automobile production rose from 21,881 in 1927 to 73,195 for the following year, when the cars became known as Graham-Paiges.

When the second series of 1930 cars was released (bringing out two series for a model year was widely practiced at the time), the name for the product (but not for the corporate name) changed to just &quot;Graham&quot;.

<doc id="253616" wikidata="Q496787" url="?curid=253616" title="Jizi">
<text>Jizi, Qizi, or Kizi (; Gija or Kija in Korean) was a semi-legendary Chinese sage who is said to have ruled Gija Joseon in the 11th century BCE. Early Chinese documents like the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; and the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; described him as a virtuous relative of the last king of the Shang dynasty who was punished for remonstrating with the king. After Shang was overthrown by Zhou in the 1040s BCE, he allegedly gave political advice to King Wu, the first Zhou king. Chinese texts from the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) onwards claimed that King Wu enfeoffed Jizi as ruler of Chaoxian (朝鮮, pronounced &quot;Joseon&quot; in Korean). According to the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (1st century CE), Jizi brought agriculture, sericulture, and many other facets of Chinese civilization to Joseon. His family name was Zi/Ja (子) and given name was Xuyu/Suyu (胥餘/서여 xūyú/seoyeo, or 須臾/수유 xūyú/suyu).

Gija (the Korean pronunciation of &quot;Jizi&quot;) may have been the object of a state cult in sixth-century Goguryeo, and a mausoleum to him was established in Goryeo in 1102, but the first extant Korean text to mention Gija was the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; (1145). Starting in the late thirteenth century, Gija was fully integrated into Korean history, being described as a successor to the descendants of Dangun in the state of Old Joseon. Following the spread of Neo-Confucianism in Korea in the fourteenth century, scholars of the Joseon period (est. 1392) promoted Gija as a culture hero alongside Dangun.

However, with the development of radiocarbon dating and newly found excavations, modern Korean historians started to question the legitimacy of his enfeoffment as ruler of Gojoseon. Shin Chaeho (1880–1936) was the first to question the extent of Gija&#x27;s cultural contributions and many followed as Gija&#x27;s historical claims did not align with archeological evidence found during the time of his supposed rule. Additionally, post-war Korean scholars in both North and South Korea have strongly criticized the story of Gija&#x27;s migration to Korea in the eleventh century BCE, claiming that his involvement in the history of Korea was widely exaggerated.

In recent times, both North and South Korea, and their respective historians do not officially recognize Jizi and his supposed accomplishments, making China the only nation that still supports his claims.

== In ancient Chinese texts ==
=== Pre-Qin sources ===
The earliest known mention of Jizi is in the &quot;Mingyi&quot; 明夷 hexagram of the &quot;Book of Change&quot;. According to other ancient Chinese texts like the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, the &quot;Analects&quot;, and the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, Jizi was a relative of King Zhou, the last ruler of the Shang dynasty, and one of the three wise men of Shang, along with Weizi (微子) and Bi Gan. Many identify him as Grand Tutor of the king. Jizi was either imprisoned or enslaved for remonstrating against King Zhou&#x27;s misrule. (One later version states that he pretended to be mad after Bigan had been killed by King Zhou.) After Shang was overthrown by the Zhou dynasty in the mid eleventh century BC, Jizi was released by King Wu, to whom he gave advice on how to rule the new polity.

These texts mention neither Joseon nor Jizi&#x27;s descendants; they simply describe Jizi as a virtuous man who was trusted by King Wu of Zhou after having been mistreated by the last Shang king.

=== Han and later texts ===
The first texts that make an explicit connection between Jizi and Joseon date from the second century BC, under the Han dynasty. The earliest known source stating that Jizi went to Joseon is the &quot;Shangshu dazhuan&quot; (尚書大傳), a commentary on the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; attributed to Fu Sheng of the second century BC. In that account, King Wu enfeoffed Jizi as the ruler of Joseon and Jizi became the subject of King Wu. In a similar story recorded in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (or &quot;Shiji&quot;, compiled between 109 and 91 BC), Jizi was enfeoffed by King Wu but did not become his subject. Sima Qian did not mention Jizi in his section on contemporary Joseon (i.e. northwestern Korea), where Wei Man&#x27;s kingdom had flourished since about 194 BC until it was conquered by the Han dynasty in 108 BC. Thus the location of &quot;Joseon&quot; as in these earlier sources is not clear. Among other Han dynasty sources, the &quot;Han shi waizhuan&quot; mentions to Jizi but not his migration to Joseon.

The &quot;Monograph on Geography&quot; (&quot;Dili zhi&quot; 地理志) of the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (1st century AD) claims that Jizi had taught the people of Joseon agriculture, sericulture, and weaving, as well as proper ceremony. Jae-hoon Shim interprets the following sentence in that section of the &quot;Hanshu&quot; as claiming that Jizi also introduced the law of &quot;Eight Prohibitions&quot; (犯禁八條) in Joseon. The &quot;Records of Three Kingdoms&quot; (first published in the early fifth century) claims that the descendants of Jizi reigned as kings of Joseon for forty generations until they were overthrown by Wei Man, a man from the state of Yan, in 194 BC.

According to his commentary to the &quot;Shiji&quot;, Du Yu (first half of the 3rd century) states that the tomb of Jizi was located in Meng Prefecture of the State of Liang (modern-day Henan). This suggests that the story of Jizi&#x27;s association with Joseon was not necessarily prevailing although the narrative seen in the &quot;Hanshu&quot; later became common.

As historian Jae-hoon Shim concludes, only during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) did Jizi begin to be associated with Joseon, and only after the Han were his descendants identified as the Joseon royal family.

== Interpretations of Gija in Korea ==
=== Ancient Korean accounts ===
The first extant Korean text to mention Gija (the Korean pronunciation of Jizi) was Kim Busik&#x27;s &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; (completed in 1145), which claimed that Gija had been enfeoffed in Haedong (海東: Korea) by the Zhou court, but commented that this account was uncertain because of the brevity of the sources. Only in the thirteenth century did Korean texts start to integrate Gija more fully into Korean history. The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; (1281) explained that after being enfeoffed by King Wu of Zhou, Gija replaced Dangun&#x27;s descendants as the ruler of Joseon, whereas &quot;Jewang Ungi&quot; (1287) identified Dangun and Gija as the first rulers of former and latter Joseon respectively. Most premodern Korean historians after that accepted that Gija had replaced another indigenous power (represented by Dangun) in Old Joseon.

In 1102, during the Goryeo period, King Sukjong built a mausoleum to Gija in a place near Pyongyang that had been identified as Gija&#x27;s tomb.Sadang for gija called gijasa (箕子祠) was also built in Pyongyang. The mausoleum was rebuilt in 1324 and was repaired in 1355, but the cult of Gija spread most widely after the establishment of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. Because Joseon&#x27;s state ideology was Neo-Confucianism borrowed from China, Joseon intellectuals promoted Gija as a culture hero who had raised Korean civilization to the same level as China.

From the second half of the sixteenth century to the eighteenth century, Joseon scholars published a number of books on Gija. In 1580, Yun Dusu (尹斗壽) collated all available material on him and published his research as the &quot;Gijaji&quot; (箕子志; &quot;Record of Gija&quot;). On the same year, eminent scholar Yi I used Yun&#x27;s book to compile the &quot;Gija Silgi&quot; (箕子實記), or &quot;True Account of Gija&quot;. Yi praised Gija for introducing agriculture, sericulture, decorum, the well-field system, and the Eight Prohibitions. Though he emphasized Gija&#x27;s independence from King Wu of Zhou, Yi believed that Gija&#x27;s teachings helped Korea to reach the same level of civilization as China. The cult of Gija also continued as temples which worshiped gija portraits called gijayeongjeon (箕子影殿), were built in the 18th century in South Pyongan Province.

Although Korean scholars became more critical of Gija&#x27;s role in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this account of Gija as the &quot;bearer of civilization from China&quot; became widely accepted, so much that by the late Joseon, the worship of Gija &quot;had become an integral part of Korean cultural identity.&quot; Some Korean clans claim to be direct descendants of Gija himself.

=== Twentieth century accounts ===
In the beginning of the twentieth century, Korean historians started to doubt the authenticity of his supposed influence. Shin Chaeho (1880–1936), a Korean independence nationalistic activist historian during the Japanese occupation, was the first to question the extent of Gija&#x27;s contributions. In an essay titled &quot;Doksa Sillon&quot; (&quot;New Reading of History&quot;; 1908), he argued that Korean history was revolved around Dangun, the legendary founder of the state of Gojoseon. Shin dismissed Gija&#x27;s contributions due to his foreign origin. Shin also argued that Gija had become a vassal of the kings of Buyeo and was only given control of a small territory.

Other historians such as Choe Nam-seon (1890–1957) and Lee Byeong-do (1896–1989) started to notice discrepancies between pre-Qin Chinese records of Jizi/Gija, and later accounts (both Chinese and Korean) of his role in Joseon. In 1973, archeologist Kim Cheong-bae (金貞培) denied Chinese influence on Korea because no ancient Chinese bronzes had been found on the peninsula.

In addition, Ri Chirin, a leading North Korean historian of ancient Korea, argued that the Gija legend had been forged in Han times when the Chinese started to occupy part of Joseon. Most North Korean scholars have followed Ri in doubting the authenticity of Gija&#x27;s migration to Joseon.

=== Modern Korean accounts ===
Modern Korean scholars also deny the existence of Gija&#x27;s involvement in Gija Joseon for various reasons. They point to the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; and the Confucian &quot;Analects&quot;, which were among the first works to mention Gija, but do not mention his migration to Gojoseon. However, some Gija enthusiasts suggest that Gija Joseon may have coexisted with Dangun, and that Gija Joseon was established at the western end of Gojoseon. This claim is mostly denied by modern Korean historians.

In addition, detractors of the Gija Joseon theory also point out that the cultural artifacts found in the region do not appear to have Chinese origins. An example of such an artifact is found in a Gojoseon mandolin-shaped bronze dagger. Its shape and bronze composition are different from similar artifacts found in China being described as &quot;The detachable handle is a key feature for distinguishing Liaoning daggers from other Chinese daggers, which were typically produced in one piece.&quot;

Currently, Korean historians (from both nations) reject the previously held belief of Gija&#x27;s involvement in Korea and thus many high school textbooks applied these recent studies reevaluating Gija and his influence with him now only being mentioned in a foot note. Additionally, the 7th edition of the Korean textbooks do not mention Jizi/Gija, making China the only nation to officially support the preceding theory.

<text>Williamina Paton Stevens Fleming (15 May 1857 – 21 May 1911) was a pioneering Scottish astronomer, who made significant contributions to the field despite facing gender biases. She was a single mother hired by the director of the Harvard College Observatory to help in the photographic classification of stellar spectra. She helped develop a common designation system for stars and cataloged more than ten thousand stars, 59 gaseous nebulae, over 310 variable stars, and 10 novae and other astronomical phenomena. Among several career achievements that advanced astronomy, Fleming is noted for her discovery of the Horsehead Nebula in 1888. Fleming&#x27;s work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the universe.

==Early life==
Williamina Paton Stevens was born in Dundee, Scotland, at 86 Nethergate, on 15 May 1857 to Mary Walker and Robert Stevens, a carver and gilder. She was one of six children. Her younger sister, Johanna Stevens, would also later work at Harvard College Observatory. Starting at the age of fourteen, she went to work as a pupil-teacher. In 1877, she married James Orr Fleming, an accountant and widower, also of Dundee. The couple had one son, Edward P. Fleming.

==Career==
In 1878, aged 21, she and her husband emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, US. After her husband abandoned her and her young son, she worked as a maid in the home of Professor Edward Charles Pickering, the director of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO). Pickering&#x27;s wife Elizabeth recommended Williamina as having talents beyond custodial and maternal arts, and in 1879, Pickering hired Fleming to conduct part-time administrative work at the observatory.

In 1881, Pickering formally invited Fleming to join the HCO and taught her how to analyze stellar spectra. She became one of the founding members of the Harvard Computers, an all-women cadre of human computers hired by Pickering to compute mathematical classifications and edit the observatory&#x27;s publications.

===Henry Draper Catalogue, 1886===
In 1886, Mary Anna Draper, the wealthy widow of astronomer Henry Draper, started the Henry Draper Memorial to fund the HCO&#x27;s research. In response, the HCO began work on the first Henry Draper Catalogue, a long-term project to obtain the optical spectra of as many stars as possible and to index and classify stars by spectra.

Fleming was placed in charge of the Draper Catalogue project. A disagreement soon developed regarding classifying the stars. The analysis had been started by Nettie Farrar, but she left a few months later to be married. Antonia Maury advocated for a complex classification scheme. Fleming, however, wanted a much more simple, straightforward approach.

The latest Harvard College Observatory images contained photographed spectra of stars that extended into the ultraviolet range, which allowed much more accurate classifications than recording spectra by hand through an instrument at night. Fleming devised a system for classifying stars according to the relative amount of hydrogen observed in their spectra, known as the Pickering-Fleming system. Stars showing hydrogen as the most abundant element were classified A; those of hydrogen as the second-most abundant element, B; and so on.

Later, her colleague Annie Jump Cannon reordered the classification system based on the surface temperature of stars, resulting in the Harvard spectral classification, which is still in use today.

In 1890, the HCO published the first Henry Draper Catalogue due to years of work by their female computer team, a catalog with more than 10,000 stars classified according to their spectrum. Fleming did the majority of these classifications. Fleming also made it possible to go back and compare recorded plates by organizing thousands of photographs by telescope along with other identifying factors. In 1898, she was appointed Curator of Astronomical Photographs at Harvard, the first woman to hold the position.

At the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, Fleming openly advocated for other women in the sciences in her talk &quot;A Field for Woman&#x27;s Work in Astronomy&quot;, where she openly promoted hiring female assistants in astronomy. Her speech suggested she agreed with the prevailing idea that women were inferior but felt that, if given more significant opportunities, they would be able to become equals; in other words, the sex differences in this regard were more culturally constructed than biologically grounded.

===Notable discoveries===
During her career, Fleming discovered a total of 59 gaseous nebulae, over 310 variable stars, and 10 novae. 
Most notably, in 1888, Fleming discovered the Horsehead Nebula on a telescope-photogrammetry plate made by astronomer W. H. Pickering, brother of E.C. Pickering. She described the bright nebula (later known as IC 434) as having &quot;a semicircular indentation 5 minutes in diameter 30 minutes south of Zeta Orionis&quot;. Subsequent professional publications neglected to give credit to Fleming for the discovery. The first Dreyer Index Catalogue omitted Fleming&#x27;s name from the list of contributors, having then discovered sky objects at Harvard, attributing the entire work merely to &quot;Pickering&quot;. However, by the time the second Dreyer Index Catalogue was published in 1908, Fleming and her female colleagues at the HCO were sufficiently well-known and received proper credit for their discoveries.

Fleming is also credited with the discovery of the first white dwarf:

In 1910, Fleming published her discovery of white dwarf stars . Her other notable publications include &quot;A Photographic Study of Variable Stars&quot; (1907), a list of 222 variable stars she had discovered; and &quot;Spectra and Photographic Magnitudes of Stars in Standard Regions&quot; (1911).

She became a US citizen in 1907.

She died of pneumonia in Boston on 21 May 1911, aged 54.

==Honors==
* Member of the Astronomical and Astrophysical Society of America and the Astronomical Society of France
* Honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society of London in 1906, the first American woman to be elected
* Guadalupe Almendaro Medal by the for her discovery of new stars 
* Honorary fellow in astronomy of Wellesley College
* Commemorated on the Dundee Women&#x27;s Trail

==Legacy==
* The Fleming lunar crater was jointly named after her and (not closely related) Alexander Fleming
* The asteroid 5747 Williamina is named after her.
* Kathryn Lasky published a book in 2021 about Fleming illustrated by Julianna Swaney called &quot;She Caught the Light: Williamina Stevens Fleming: Astronomer&quot; aimed at young people.
The women of the Harvard Computers were famous during their lifetimes but were largely forgotten in the following century. In 2015, Lindsay Smith Zrull, curator of Harvard&#x27;s Plate Stacks collection, was working to catalog and digitize the astronomical plates for Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH)and discovered about 118 boxes, each containing 20 to 30 notebooks, from women computers and early Harvard astronomers. Smith Zrull realized that the 2,500+ volumes were outside the scope of her work with DASCH but wanted to see the material preserved and made accessible. Smith Zrull contacted librarians at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. 

In response, the Wolbach Library launched Project PHaEDRA (Preserving Harvard&#x27;s Early Data and Research in Astronomy). Daina Bouquin, Wolbach&#x27;s Head Librarian, explained that the objective is to enable full-text search of the research: &quot;If you search for Williamina Fleming, you&#x27;re not going to just find a mention of her in a publication where she wasn&#x27;t the author of her work. You&#x27;re going to find her work.&quot;

In July 2017, the Wolbach Library at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian unveiled a display showcasing Fleming&#x27;s work, including the log book containing the Horsehead Nebula discovery. The library has dozens of volumes of Fleming&#x27;s work in its PHaEDRA collection.

, about 200 of over 2,500 volumes had been transcribed. The task is expected to take years to complete fully. Some of the notebooks are listed via the Smithsonian Digital Volunteers Web site, which encourages volunteers to transcribe them.

<doc id="253628" wikidata="Q2777013" url="?curid=253628" title="George Costanza">
<text>George Louis Costanza is a fictional character in the American television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1989–1998), played by Jason Alexander. He is a short, stocky, balding man who struggles with numerous insecurities, often dooming his romantic relationships through his own fear of being dumped. He is also relatively lazy; during periods of unemployment he actively avoids getting a job, and while employed he often finds ingenious ways to conceal idleness from his bosses. He is friends with Jerry Seinfeld, Cosmo Kramer, and Elaine Benes. George and Jerry were junior high school friends (although in &quot;The Betrayal&quot;, Season 9, Episode 8, George says the two have been friends since fourth grade) and remained friends afterward. George appears in every episode except &quot;The Pen&quot; (third season).

The character was based on Seinfeld co-creator Larry David but is surnamed after Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s real-life New York friend, Michael Costanza. Alexander reprised his role in an episode of &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;, reuniting with Jerry Seinfeld and Wayne Knight (also reprising their roles as Jerry and Newman, respectively).

==Early life and family==
George is a son of Frank, an Italian American, and Estelle Costanza, who is Jewish. George twice mentions that he has a brother. Lloyd Braun is a childhood nemesis who George feels was the son his parents always wanted. George&#x27;s best friend Jerry Seinfeld described Frank and Estelle as &quot;psychopaths&quot;, and said in &quot;The Chinese Woman&quot; that, if they had divorced when George was young, he &quot;could have been normal&quot;.

In &quot;The Junior Mint&quot;, George states he grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where he went to a public school. In a previous episode he mentions he went to high school on Long Island. He met Jerry during his youth, and they remained friends from that point on. George and Jerry both attended John F. Kennedy High School, class of 1971. During their high school years, George and Jerry frequently hung out at a pizzeria called Mario&#x27;s Pizzas, where the former, having the highest score &quot;GLC&quot;, would play &quot;Frogger&quot; (although &quot;Frogger&quot; debuted in 1981, well after the pair&#x27;s high school graduation in 1971). George was picked on by his gym teacher Mr. Heyman, who deliberately mispronounced his name as &quot;can&#x27;t stand ya&quot; and gave him wedgies. He and Jerry then attended Queens College.

Two of George&#x27;s cousins appear on the show: Shelly, who briefly appears to visit Estelle in the hospital in &quot;The Contest&quot;, and Rhisa, whom George plans to date in order to shock his parents in &quot;The Junk Mail&quot;. George talks to his parents about his family in &quot;The Money&quot;, during which it is revealed that he had an &quot;Uncle Moe&quot;, who &quot;died a young man&quot; and an &quot;Aunt Baby&quot;, who died at the age of seven of internal problems. It is also revealed that his mother has a &quot;Cousin Henny&quot;. In &quot;The Doll&quot;, it is revealed that Frank Costanza was born in Italy and has a cousin, Carlo, who still lives there. As of &quot;The Robbery&quot;, George had living grandparents whom he had recently visited, although it is never made clear whether these were his maternal or paternal grandparents.

==Personality==
George is neurotic, self-loathing, mostly selfish, and dominated by his parents, yet also prone to occasional periods of overconfidence that invariably arise at the worst possible time. Throughout &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s early seasons, despite doing poorly on his SATs and being afraid of embarrassing himself on an IQ test (as depicted in &quot;The Cafe&quot;), George is depicted as moderately intelligent – he mentions interests in the Civil War and musical theatre, and in some early episodes appears almost like a mentor to Jerry – but becomes less sophisticated, to the point of being too lazy even to read a 90-page book (&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;), preferring to watch the movie adaptation at a stranger&#x27;s house instead. In &quot;The Abstinence&quot;, it is discovered that George has what would appear to be genius-level intelligence but can never access it because his mind is always so completely focused on sex. One &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reviewer noted that, despite all his shortcomings, George is &quot;pretty content with himself&quot;.

George exhibits several negative character traits, among them dishonesty, insecurity, anxiety and being extremely careful with money, many of which seem to stem from a dysfunctional childhood with his eccentric parents Frank and Estelle, and often form the basis of his involvement in various plots, schemes, and embarrassing social encounters. George&#x27;s extremely narcissistic parents only accept things from George when events revolve around them, and George is blind to see that at the same time his parents treat him like a second grade child. Episode plots frequently feature George manufacturing elaborate deceptions at work or in his relationships to gain or maintain some slight or imagined advantage or (pretend) image of success. He is shown to have an intense fear of commitment. He had success in &quot;The Opposite&quot;, where on Jerry&#x27;s advice he starts to do the complete opposite of what his instincts tell him to do, which results in him getting a girlfriend and a job with the New York Yankees. His anxiety is also evident in &quot;The Note&quot;, where he begins doubting his sexuality after he receives a massage from a male masseur.

George refers to himself in the third person when under extreme stress (e.g. &quot;George is getting upset!&quot;), after befriending a person with a similar trait in &quot;The Jimmy&quot;.

George flees a burning kitchen during his girlfriend&#x27;s son&#x27;s birthday party, knocking over several children and an old woman so he can escape first in &quot;The Fire&quot;. There are moments where George exhibits remarkable courage, but usually accidentally and often in support of inane lies he would rather not confess to. For instance, in &quot;The Marine Biologist&quot;, he goes into the sea alone to save a beached whale because his date, a woman on whom he had a crush in college, thinks he is a marine biologist.

George often takes impressive measures to build and maintain relationships with women. In &quot;The Conversion,&quot; he goes through the process of converting to the Latvian Orthodox Church as his girlfriend&#x27;s parents would not let her date somebody outside their religion. The one relationship he holds long-term, with his fiancée Susan, is the one about which he is seemingly least enthusiastic, as shown by his ongoing attempts to postpone, and later cancel, their wedding, and his rather nonchalant reaction when she dies.

He is interested in nice restrooms, and his personal bathroom habits border on obsession. In &quot;The Revenge&quot;, he quits his real estate job solely because he is forbidden to use his boss&#x27;s private bathroom. In &quot;The Voice&quot;, he admits that one of the reasons he is staying at a job his boss has asked that he resign from (for feigning a disability) is that it gives him &quot;private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city&quot;. In &quot;The Busboy&quot;, he claims to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the locations of the best public bathrooms in the city. He proves this in &quot;The Bizarro Jerry&quot;, when he directs Kramer to &quot;the best bathroom in midtown&quot; at the offices of Brandt-Leland, even describing the layout, marble, high ceiling, and toilets that flush &quot;like a jet engine&quot;. In &quot;The Gymnast&quot;, he told Jerry that he always removes his shirt when using the bathroom because &quot;it frees me up... no encumbrances&quot;. When working for the Yankees, he suggested having the bathroom stall doors stretched all the way to the ground (letting people&#x27;s legs not be seen while in the stalls). The obsession even comes up in the Seinfeld reunion staged on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;: years after the series, George is said to have made a fortune on a smartphone app that directs its user to the nearest &quot;acceptable&quot; public toilet anywhere in the world (though he loses most, if not all, of his fortune to Bernie Madoff).

George and Jerry have been best friends since meeting in high school gym class. The extreme closeness of their friendship is occasionally mistaken for homosexuality; &quot;The Outing&quot; deals with a reporter from a New York University college paper mistaking George and Jerry for a gay couple, and, in &quot;The Cartoon&quot;, George dates somebody who Kramer insists is merely a &quot;female Jerry&quot;.

==Other information==

===Susan===
George becomes engaged to Susan Ross, an executive at NBC who approved his and Jerry&#x27;s show-within-a-show sitcom pilot. George and Susan date, during which time commitment-phobic George is constantly trying to find ways to end their relationship without actually having to initiate the breakup with her. In &quot;The Engagement&quot;, he proposes to her, despite him not having dated her for years. George tries repeatedly to weasel out of his engagement. In &quot;The Invitations&quot;, she dies from licking the toxic glue in their wedding invitations. When notified of her death at the hospital, George displays a combination of shock, apathy, and relief. A few moments after being notified of Susan&#x27;s death, he says to Jerry, Kramer, and Elaine, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s go get some coffee.&quot; Susan&#x27;s parents appoint him to the board of directors of the Susan Ross Foundation.

George is very bad at meeting women and even worse at maintaining his romantic relationships and, as a result, his relationships usually end badly.

===Professional life===
George&#x27;s professional life is unstable, and he is unable to remain in any job for any great length of time before making an embarrassing blunder and getting fired, and thus he is unemployed for a large amount of time throughout the series. 

His original job when the series starts is as a real estate agent; he ends up quitting and getting re-hired, but he is fired immediately afterward for drugging his boss. He always wanted to be an architect or least &quot;pretend to be an architect&quot;. He first mentions this desire in &quot;The Stake Out&quot;, and claims in &quot;The Race&quot; that he had designed &quot;the new addition to the Guggenheim&quot;.

Over the course of the series, he works for a real estate transaction services firm (Rick Barr Properties), a rest stop supply company (Sanalac), the New York Yankees as Assistant to the Travelling Secretary (his longest-running job), a playground-equipment company (Play Now), and an industrial smoothing company (Kruger Industrial Smoothing). He briefly works with Elaine at Pendant Publishing but is fired for having sex with the cleaning woman on his desk in &quot;The Red Dot&quot;. He has a very successful interview to become a bra salesman but upon leaving the interview he rubs the fabric of a woman at the elevator who turns out to be head of the company and is immediately fired.

When seeking another job, the interview gets interrupted in the middle and George does not know if he is hired or not, so he decides just to show up anyway, and is soon asked to work on a &quot;Pensky File&quot; that he knows nothing about. 

At one point, George works briefly as a hand model in &quot;The Puffy Shirt&quot;, and also for his father selling computers in &quot;The Serenity Now&quot;.

During Season 4, George gains experience as a sitcom writer as he helps Jerry to write the pilot for the fictitious show &quot;Jerry&quot;. While pitching the concept of a &quot;show about nothing&quot; to NBC executives, George begins dating NBC executive Susan Ross until &quot;The Virgin&quot;, when she is fired. The &quot;Jerry&quot; pilot is never picked up.

===Fashion and hairstyle===
George has balding hair, which is less noticeable in &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot; or a flashback in &quot;The Slicer&quot;, but gets thinner as the series progresses. At the end of &quot;The Scofflaw&quot;, he starts to wear a toupee, until Elaine throws it out the window in disgust in &quot;The Beard&quot;. He also tries to restore his hair in &quot;The Tape&quot;, in which he starts using a Chinese cream that is said to be a cure for baldness. His hair is rarely seen styled. His clothing is usually very plain. He frequently wears jeans and Nike Cortez sneakers. In &quot;The Trip, Part 1&quot;, he mentions that his clothes are color-coded based on his mood. Several times throughout the show, George mentions a desire to &quot;drape&quot; himself in velvet, which he does in &quot;The Doodle&quot;. In &quot;The Bizarro Jerry&quot;, George can be seen styling his hair based on an Andy Sipowicz poster.

==Art Vandelay==
Art Vandelay is an alias first used by George in &quot;The Stake Out&quot;. To explain their presence in the lobby of an office building, Jerry and George come up with a cover story based around a man they plan to meet named Art Vandelay, an importer–exporter who works in the building. George frequently reuses the invented name as a running joke. In &quot;The Red Dot&quot;, George tells Elaine&#x27;s boss that he frequently reads books by Art Vandelay, who he describes as a &quot;beatnik, from the Village.&quot; In &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, George tells the unemployment office that he is close to getting a job at &quot;Vandelay Industries&quot;, a latex manufacturer ostensibly located at Jerry&#x27;s address. He later tells Susan that Art is Elaine&#x27;s boyfriend as part of a cover story to prevent Susan from learning that he is secretly dating Marisa Tomei (&quot;The Cadillac&quot;). In &quot;The Bizarro Jerry&quot;, George asks an office receptionist to see a &quot;Mr. Art Vandelay&quot; as part of a ruse to ask her on a date. In &quot;The Serenity Now&quot;, George invents fake customers, one of whom is &quot;Mr. Vandelay&quot;, to hide his lack of sales success. In &quot;The Puerto Rican Day&quot;, George pretends to be Vandelay (Jerry pretends to be &quot;Kel Varnsen&quot;, and Kramer is &quot;H.E. Pennypacker&quot;) to take advantage of an open house to watch a Mets game on television. In &quot;The Finale&quot;, the name of the presiding judge is Arthur Vandelay, much to George&#x27;s amazement.

==Development==
&quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-creator Larry David based George largely on himself. Seinfeld and David created the character as a foil to Seinfeld&#x27;s character. In the first draft of the show&#x27;s pilot script, called &quot;Stand-Up&quot; at the time, George&#x27;s name was &quot;Bennett&quot; and he, like Jerry, was a comedian. In that same draft, the scene in the pilot in which George and Jerry discuss a woman Jerry met earlier, instead saw George and Jerry discussing their stand-up act. His name was changed to George, and he became a real estate broker instead. George&#x27;s last name comes from Michael Costanza, a college classmate of Seinfeld. &quot;Louis&quot;, George&#x27;s middle name, is a homage to Lou Costello, whose 1950s television series &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; inspired &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Although he is often asked whether he wanted to play the character, Larry David has said that he was only interested in writing the show, and doubted that NBC would have approved of his being cast.

Casting director Marc Hirschfeld stated that, during casting for the character, &quot;we saw every actor we could possibly see in Los Angeles&quot;, but they could not find the right actor for the part. Among the auditionees were Nathan Lane, David Alan Grier, Brad Hall and Larry Miller. A 2011 article by Bradford Evans in &quot;Splitsider&quot; claims those considered for Costanza include Danny DeVito and Nathan Lane, while Jason Alexander himself has noted that Steve Buscemi, Paul Shaffer and Chris Rock were also considered for the role. Robert Schimmel also auditioned.

On April 3, 1989, Hirschfeld sent a partial script to Jason Alexander, who was in New York City at the time. Hirschfeld had met Alexander when he was working on the CBS sitcom &quot;E/R&quot;. Alexander enjoyed the script and felt it read like a Woody Allen film; therefore, he did a Woody Allen impression on his audition tape and bought a pair of glasses to better resemble the actor. Though Alexander thought his audition was &quot;a complete waste of time&quot;, both David and Seinfeld were impressed; Seinfeld stated &quot;the second we saw him, like two lines out of his mouth, we went &#x27;That&#x27;s the guy. On April 10, 1989, at 9:00 a.m. Alexander did his first official audition and met David and Seinfeld. While in the waiting room for his final audition, Alexander saw that Larry Miller was also auditioning. Alexander was aware that Miller and Seinfeld were very good friends, and so figured that he would not get the part. After his final audition, he returned to New York City, and when he landed he received a phone call informing him that he was hired.

Many of George&#x27;s predicaments were based on David&#x27;s past real-life experiences. In &quot;The Revenge&quot;, for example, when George quits his job in a fury only to realize he has made a mistake, he goes back the next day as if nothing happened; this mirrors David&#x27;s actions while working as a writer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, when he quit and then returned to his job in the same manner. When David explained this to him, Alexander realized that the character was based on David, and changed his performance from the Woody Allen imitation to what he has called a &quot;shameless imitation of Larry David.&quot;

In 1998, Michael Costanza sued the show for US$100,000,000, claiming that he never gave permission for his name to be used and that, because of the character&#x27;s appearance and behavior, he was not treated with respect. Costanza lost the suit, as the New York Supreme Court decided that Seinfeld and David &quot;did not violate Michael Costanza&#x27;s privacy rights when they created the character&quot;.

==Reception==
In a list of the &quot;50 Greatest Sidekicks&quot; compiled by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, George was placed third, behind Robin from the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; co-host Ed McMahon. On a &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; list of the 50 greatest sitcom characters of all time, George was ranked third, behind Lucy Ricardo from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and Barney Fife from &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; published a list of the 50 best characters in television history, on which George was ranked 10th. &quot;The People&quot; called George the greatest television character on a list of the 100 best television characters. British comedian Ricky Gervais and &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist Marina Hyde have both called George &quot;arguably the greatest sitcom character of all time&quot;.

For his performance as George, Alexander was nominated for various awards. In 1992, he received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series; however, he lost the award to Michael Jeter for &quot;Evening Shade&quot;. He received nominations in the same category the following six years, but failed to win each year. In addition, Alexander was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards—in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1998—in the Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture Made for Television category, but never won the award. In 1995, Alexander received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series, he also shared the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series with Seinfeld, Louis-Dreyfus, and Richards. From 1996 through 1998, Alexander was nominated in the same two categories, co-winning the ensemble award in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series for the last time, but lost to Michael J. Fox for his portrayal of Michael Flaherty on &quot;Spin City&quot;. In 1992 and 1993, Alexander won the American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Male Performer in a TV Series. He was also nominated for the award in 1996 (with Richards) and 1999 but did not win again.

<text>Thomas Starr King (December 17, 1824 – March 4, 1864), often known as Starr King, was an American Universalist and Unitarian minister, influential in California politics during the American Civil War, and Freemason. Starr King spoke zealously in favor of the Union and was credited by Abraham Lincoln with preventing California from becoming a separate republic. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;the orator who saved the nation&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born on December 17, 1824, in New York City to Rev. Thomas Farrington King, a Universalist minister, and Susan Starr King. The sole support of his family at 15, he was forced to leave school. Inspired by men like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Ward Beecher, King embarked on a program of self-study for the ministry. At the age of 20 he took over his father&#x27;s former pulpit at the Charlestown Universalist Church in Charlestown, Massachusetts.

==Career==

In 1849, he was appointed pastor of the Hollis Street Church in Boston, where he became one of the most famous preachers in New England and a noted speaker on the lyceum circuit through New England and as far as Chicago. He was ranked as one of the four greatest lyceum speakers, along with Wendell Phillips, Edwin Hubbell Chapin, and Henry Ward Beecher; for some reason, a celebrated fifth speaker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, was not included in this tally. His lyceum lectures for general audiences included &quot;Substance and Show&quot;, &quot;Sights and Insights&quot;, &quot;The Ideal and the Real&quot;, &quot;Existence and Life&quot;, and a number of talks on Plato and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. As Edward Everett Hale recounts:

King said that a popular lyceum lecture was made of five parts of sense and five of nonsense. &quot;There are only five men in America,&quot; said he, &quot;who know how to mix them—and I think I am one of the five.&quot; Other people thought so too, and did not detect the nonsense. His carefully wrought lectures are worth anybody&#x27;s study today. He is the author of another lyceum chestnut. Some one asked him what his honorarium was for each lecture. &quot;F.A.M.E.,&quot; said he—&quot;Fifty And My Expenses.&quot;

During those years, Starr King vacationed in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and in 1859 published a book about the area entitled &quot;The White Hills; their Legends, Landscapes, &amp; Poetry&quot;. In 1860 he accepted a call from the First Unitarian Church of San Francisco, California. In July of that year, he visited Yosemite and was moved spiritually by its splendor. Upon returning to San Francisco, he began preaching a series of sermons on Yosemite, published letters about it in the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, and aligned himself with fellow abolitionist and landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, to have Yosemite set aside as a reserve. Yosemite would become a California State Park and eventually a national park. Starr King joined the Freemasons and was raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason in Oriental Lodge No. 144 in San Francisco, now Phoenix Lodge No. 144, and served as grand orator of the Grand Lodge of California in 1863.

During the Civil War, Starr King spoke zealously in favor of the Union and was credited by Abraham Lincoln with preventing California from becoming a separate republic. At the urging of Jessie Benton Frémont, Starr King teamed up with writer Bret Harte, and Starr King read Harte&#x27;s patriotic poems at pro-Union speeches. Starr King also read original verses by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and James Russell Lowell which captured the imagination of the Californians. In a letter by Starr King wrote to James T. Fields, the editor of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The state must be Northernized thoroughly, by schools, Atlantic Monthlies, lectures, N.E. preachers.&quot; On George Washington&#x27;s birthday in 1861, King spoke for two hours to over a thousand people about how they should remember Washington by preserving the Union:

&quot;I pitched into Secession, Concession and Calhoun, right and left, and made the Southerners applaud. I pledged California to a Northern Republic and to a flag that should have no treacherous threads of cotton in its warp, and the audience came down in thunder. At the close it was announced that I would repeat it the next night, and they gave me three rounds of cheers.&quot; ... King covered his pulpit with an American flag and ended all his sermons with &quot;God bless the president of the United States and all who serve with him the cause of a common country.&quot;

Starr King&#x27;s younger brother, Edward Starr King, served as captain of the clipper ship &quot;Syren&quot;. Capt. Starr King arrived in San Francisco aboard &quot;Syren&quot; just two days after his elder brother&#x27;s stirring 1861 speech about Washington and the Union, remarking, &quot;Starr has the brains of the family, and I the brawn.&quot;

In addition, Starr King organized the Pacific Branch of the United States Sanitary Commission, which raised money and medical materials for wounded soldiers and was the predecessor to the American Red Cross. A fiery orator, he raised more than $1.5 million for the Sanitary Commission headquarters in New York City, one-fifth of the total contributions from all the states in the Union.

==Death==

The relentless lecture circuit exhausted him, and he died in San Francisco on March 4, 1864, of diphtheria and pneumonia. His dying words were said to be &quot;Beautiful boy&quot;, referring to his young son. Over twenty thousand people attended his funeral and several of his friends including Charles Stoddard, Bret Harte and Ina Coolbrith published tributes. King was first interred on the 100 block of Geary Street and is now interred at First Unitarian Universalist Society of San Francisco at Starr King Way and Franklin Street between O&#x27;Farrell Street and Geary Street in San Francisco. In the 1940s, most of San Francisco&#x27;s dead were disinterred and moved to new resting places outside city limits; the grave of Starr King was one of the very few allowed to remain undisturbed.

===Statue in California State Capitol===

As part of honors originally paid to Rev. King, he was judged worthy of representing California in the National Statuary Hall Collection displayed in the United States Capitol. In 1913, King was voted one of California&#x27;s two greatest heroes and funds were appropriated for a statue. In 1931, California officially donated a bronze statue of King to be mounted in Statuary Hall.

On August 31, 2006, however, the California Legislature approved a joint resolution to replace Thomas Starr King&#x27;s statue in Statuary Hall with a statue of Ronald Reagan. The resolution was authored by Republican State Senator Dennis Hollingsworth, who stated the reason for the resolution as, &quot;To be honest with you, I wasn&#x27;t sure who Thomas Starr King was, and I think there&#x27;s probably a lot of Californians like me.&quot; He also went on to observe that King was not a native of the state though, of course, neither was Reagan (nor was Junípero Serra, the other statue representing California in Statuary Hall).

As a result of this resolution, King&#x27;s statue was removed from Statuary Hall, and the statue of Ronald Reagan was placed in Statuary Hall on June 10, 2009. In November 2009, Starr King&#x27;s statue was reinstalled within the Civil War Memorial Grove in Capitol Park, which surrounds the California State Capitol in Sacramento. It was formally dedicated in a ceremony held on December 8, 2009.

<text>COBUILD, an acronym for Collins Birmingham University International Language Database, is a British research facility set up at the University of Birmingham in 1980 and funded by Collins publishers.

The facility was initially led by professor John Sinclair. The most important achievements of the COBUILD project have been the creation and analysis of an electronic corpus of contemporary text, the &quot;Collins Corpus&quot;, later leading to the development of the Bank of English, and the production of the monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionary &quot;Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary&quot;, based on the study of the COBUILD corpus and first published in 1987.

A collection of other dictionaries and grammars have also been published, all based exclusively on the evidence from the Bank of English.

<text>Albert Sidney(or Sydney)Hornby, usually just A. S. Hornby (1898–1978), was an English grammarian, lexicographer, and pioneer in the field of English language learning and teaching (ELT).

Hornby was born in Chester and educated at University College London. In April 1924 he went to Japan to teach English at Oita University (Oita Higher Commercial School at the time). He joined Harold E. Palmer in his programme of vocabulary research at the Institute for Research in English Teaching (IRET). Palmer invited him to Tokyo in April 1933 as an assistant; in 1936, Hornby became the technical adviser and editor of IRET&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin&quot;.

He began to work the following year with E. V. Gatenby and H. Wakefield on a new type of dictionary that was aimed at foreign learners of English, the first monolingual learners&#x27; dictionary. It was completed in 1940 and published by Kaitakusha two years later in Tokyo as &quot;The Idiomatic and Syntactic English Dictionary&quot;. After leaving Japan in 1942, Hornby joined the British Council and later became the first editor of the journal &quot;English Language Teaching&quot;, launched in October 1946.

In 1948 his dictionary was reissued by Oxford University Press as &quot;A Learner&#x27;s Dictionary of Current English&quot;. The subsequent editions of the dictionary were (1963 second, 1974 third) and continue to be a great commercial success in ELT publishing. It is now in its tenth edition and is known as the &quot;Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

The A.S. Hornby Educational Trust was established in 1961. The Trust supports ELT practitioners from low and lower-middle income countries. The Trust has supported over 480 ELT professionals from around the world via Hornby Scholarships, and thousands more via regional schools, a scholar alumni network and Teacher Association project awards. The Trust also supports dictionary-related research and research into the history of ELT.

<text>There are hundreds of local Chinese language varieties forming a branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, many of which are not mutually intelligible. Variation is particularly strong in the more mountainous southeast part of mainland China. The varieties are typically classified into several groups: Mandarin, Wu, Min, Xiang, Gan, Jin, Hakka and Yue, though some varieties remain unclassified. These groups are neither clades nor individual languages defined by mutual intelligibility, but reflect common phonological developments from Middle Chinese.

Chinese varieties have the greatest differences in their phonology, and to a lesser extent in vocabulary and syntax. Southern varieties tend to have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants. All have phonemic tones, with northern varieties tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones. Many have tone sandhi, with the most complex patterns in the coastal area from Zhejiang to eastern Guangdong.

Standard Chinese takes its phonology from the Beijing dialect, with vocabulary from the Mandarin group and grammar based on literature in the modern written vernacular. It is one of the official languages of China and one of the four official languages of Singapore. It has become a pluricentric language, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between the three forms. It is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations.

== History ==
At the end of the 2nd millennium BC, a form of Chinese was spoken in a compact area along the lower Wei River and middle Yellow River. Use of this language expanded eastwards across the North China Plain into Shandong, and then southwards into the Yangtze River valley and the hills of south China. Chinese eventually replaced many of the languages previously dominant in these areas, and forms of the language spoken in different regions began to diverge. During periods of political unity there was a tendency for states to promote the use of a standard language across the territory they controlled, in order to facilitate communication between people from different regions.

The first evidence of dialectal variation is found in the texts of the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Although the Zhou royal domain was no longer politically powerful, its speech still represented a model for communication across China. The &quot;Fangyan&quot; (early 1st century AD) is devoted to differences in vocabulary between regions. Commentaries from the Eastern Han (25–220 AD) provide significant evidence of local differences in pronunciation. The &quot;Qieyun&quot;, a rime dictionary published in 601, noted wide variations in pronunciation between regions, and was created with the goal of defining a standard system of pronunciation for reading the classics. This standard is known as Middle Chinese, and is believed to be a diasystem, based on a compromise between the reading traditions of the northern and southern capitals.

The North China Plain provided few barriers to migration, which resulted in relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area. Contrastingly, the mountains and rivers of southern China contain all six of the other major Chinese dialect groups, with each in turn featuring great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.

=== Standard Chinese ===

Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local language. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as (/ &#x27;officer speech&#x27;). While never formally defined, knowledge of this language was essential for a career in the imperial bureaucracy.

In the early years of the Republic of China, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. In the 1930s, a standard national language with pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect was adopted, but with vocabulary drawn from a range of Mandarin varieties, and grammar based on literature in the modern written vernacular. Standard Chinese is the official spoken language of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Taiwan, and is one of the official languages of Singapore. It has become a pluricentric language, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between the three forms.

Standard Chinese is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese, and its use is now dominant in public life on the mainland. Outside of China and Taiwan, the only varieties of Chinese commonly taught in university courses are Standard Chinese and Cantonese.

=== Comparison with Romance ===
Local varieties from different areas of China are often mutually unintelligible, differing at least as much as different Romance languages and perhaps even as much as Indo-European languages as a whole. As with the Romance languages descended from Latin, the ancestral language was spread by imperial expansion over substrate languages 2000 years ago, by the Qin and Han empires in China, and the Roman Empire in Europe. Medieval Latin remained the standard for scholarly and administrative writing in Western Europe for centuries, influencing local varieties much like Literary Chinese did in China. In both cases, local forms of speech diverged from both the literary standard and each other, producing dialect continua with mutually unintelligible varieties separated by long distances.

However, a major difference between China and Western Europe is the historical reestablishment of political unity in 6th century China by the Sui dynasty, a unity that has persisted with relatively brief interludes until the present day. Meanwhile, Europe remained politically decentralized, and developed numerous independent states. Vernacular writing using the Latin alphabet supplanted Latin itself, and states eventually developed their own standard languages. In China, Literary Chinese was predominantly used in formal writing until the early 20th century. Written Chinese, read with different local pronunciations, continued to serve as a source of vocabulary for the local varieties. The new standard written vernacular Chinese, the counterpart of spoken Standard Chinese, is similarly used as a literary form by speakers of all varieties.

==Classification==

Dialectologist Jerry Norman estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese. These varieties form a dialect continuum, in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, although there are also some sharp boundaries.

However, the rate of change in mutual intelligibility varies immensely depending on region. For example, the varieties of Mandarin spoken in all three northeastern Chinese provinces are mutually intelligible, but in the province of Fujian, where Min varieties predominate, the speech of neighbouring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.

===Dialect groups===
Classifications of Chinese varieties in the late 19th century and early 20th century were based on impressionistic criteria. They often followed river systems, which were historically the main routes of migration and communication in southern China. The first scientific classifications, based primarily on the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials, were produced by Wang Li in 1936 and Li Fang-Kuei in 1937, with minor modifications by other linguists since. The conventionally accepted set of seven dialect groups first appeared in the second edition (1980) of Yuan Jiahua&#x27;s dialectology handbook:

;Mandarin
:This is the group spoken in northern and southwestern China and has by far the most speakers. This group includes the Beijing dialect, which forms the basis for Standard Chinese, called &quot;Putonghua&quot; or &quot;Guoyu&quot; in Chinese, and often also translated as &quot;Mandarin&quot; or simply &quot;Chinese&quot;. In addition, the Dungan language of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan is a Mandarin variety written in the Cyrillic script.
;Wu
:These varieties are spoken in Shanghai, most of Zhejiang and the southern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui. The group comprises hundreds of distinct spoken forms, many of which are not mutually intelligible. The Suzhou dialect is usually taken as representative, because Shanghainese features several atypical innovations. Wu varieties are distinguished by their retention of voiced or murmured obstruent initials (stops, affricates and fricatives).
;Gan
:These varieties are spoken in Jiangxi and neighbouring areas. The Nanchang dialect is taken as representative. In the past, Gan was viewed as closely related to Hakka because of the way Middle Chinese voiced initials became voiceless aspirated initials as in Hakka, and were hence called by the umbrella term &quot;Hakka–Gan dialects&quot;.
;Xiang
:The Xiang varieties are spoken in Hunan and southern Hubei. The New Xiang varieties, represented by the Changsha dialect, have been significantly influenced by Southwest Mandarin, whereas Old Xiang varieties, represented by the Shuangfeng dialect, retain features such as voiced initials.
;Min
:These varieties originated in the mountainous terrain of Fujian and eastern Guangdong, and form the only branch of Chinese that cannot be directly derived from Middle Chinese. It is also the most diverse, with many of the varieties used in neighbouring counties—and, in the mountains of western Fujian, even in adjacent villages—being mutually unintelligible. Early classifications divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups, but a survey in the early 1960s found that the primary split was between inland and coastal groups. Varieties from the coastal region around Xiamen have spread to Southeast Asia, where they are known as Hokkien (named from a dialectical pronunciation of &quot;Fujian&quot;), and Taiwan, where they are known as Taiwanese. Other offshoots of Min are found in Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula, with smaller communities throughout southern China.
;Hakka
:The Hakka (literally &quot;guest families&quot;) are a group of Han Chinese living in the hills of northeastern Guangdong, southwestern Fujian and many other parts of southern China, as well as Taiwan and parts of Southeast Asia such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Meixian dialect is the prestige form. Most Hakka varieties retain the full complement of nasal endings, and stop endings , though there is a tendency for Middle Chinese velar codas -ŋ and -k to yield dental codas -n and -t after front vowels.
;Yue
:These varieties are spoken in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong and Macau, and have been carried by immigrants to Southeast Asia and many other parts of the world. The prestige variety and by far most commonly spoken variety is Cantonese, from the city of Guangzhou (historically called &quot;Canton&quot;), which is also the native language of the majority in Hong Kong and Macau. Taishanese, from the coastal area of Jiangmen southwest of Guangzhou, was historically the most common Yue variety among overseas communities in the West until the late 20th century. Not all Yue varieties are mutually intelligible. Most Yue varieties retain the full complement of Middle Chinese word-final consonants () and have rich inventories of tones.

The &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot; (1987) follows a classification of Li Rong, distinguishing three further groups:
;Jin
:These varieties, spoken in Shanxi and adjacent areas, were formerly included in Mandarin. They are distinguished by their retention of the Middle Chinese entering tone category.
;Huizhou
:The Hui dialects, spoken in southern Anhui, share different features with Wu, Gan and Mandarin, making them difficult to classify. Earlier scholars had assigned to them one or other of these groups, or to a group of their own.
;Pinghua
:These varieties are descended from the speech of the earliest Chinese migrants to Guangxi, predating the later influx of Yue and Southwest Mandarin speakers. Some linguists treat them as a mixture of Yue and Xiang.

Some varieties remain unclassified, including the Danzhou dialect (northwestern Hainan), Mai (southern Hainan), Waxiang (northwestern Hunan), Xiangnan Tuhua (southern Hunan), Shaozhou Tuhua (northern Guangdong), and the forms of Chinese spoken by the She people (She Chinese) and the Miao people.
She Chinese, Xiangnan Tuhua, Shaozhou Tuhua and unclassified varieties of southwest Jiangxi appear to be related to Hakka.

Most of the vocabulary of the Bai language of Yunnan appears to be related to Chinese words, though many are clearly loans from the last few centuries. Some scholars have suggested that it represents a very early branching from Chinese, while others argue that it is a more distantly related Sino-Tibetan language overlaid with two millennia of loans.

===Dialect geography===

Jerry Norman classified the traditional seven dialect groups into three zones: Northern (Mandarin), Central (Wu, Gan, and Xiang) and Southern (Hakka, Yue, and Min).
He argued that the dialects of the Southern zone are derived from a standard used in the Yangtze valley during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), which he called Old Southern Chinese, while the Central zone was a transitional area of dialects that were originally of southern type, but overlain with centuries of Northern influence.
Hilary Chappell proposed a refined model, dividing Norman&#x27;s Northern zone into Northern and Southwestern areas, and his Southern zone into Southeastern (Min) and Far Southern (Yue and Hakka) areas, with Pinghua transitional between Southwestern and Far Southern areas.

The long history of migration of peoples and interaction between speakers of different dialects makes it difficult to apply the tree model to Chinese.
Scholars account for the transitional nature of the central varieties in terms of wave models. Iwata argues that innovations have been transmitted from the north across the Huai River to the Lower Yangtze Mandarin area and from there southeast to the Wu area and westwards along the Yangtze River valley and thence to southwestern areas, leaving the hills of the southeast largely untouched.

Some dialect boundaries, such as between Wu and Min, are particularly abrupt, while others, such as between Mandarin and Xiang or between Min and Hakka, are much less clearly defined.
Several east-west isoglosses run along the Huai and Yangtze Rivers.
A north-south barrier is formed by the Tianmu and Wuyi Mountains.

===Intelligibility testing===
Most assessments of mutual intelligibility of varieties of Chinese in the literature are impressionistic.
Functional intelligibility testing is time-consuming in any language family, and usually not done when more than 10 varieties are to be compared.
However, one 2009 study aimed to measure intelligibility between 15 Chinese provinces. In each province, 15 university students were recruited as speakers and 15 older rural inhabitants recruited as listeners. The listeners were then tested on their comprehension of isolated words and of particular words in the context of sentences spoken by speakers from all 15 of the provinces surveyed.
The results demonstrated significant levels of unintelligibility between areas, even within the Mandarin group. In a few cases, listeners understood fewer than 70% of words spoken by speakers from the same province, indicating significant differences between urban and rural varieties. As expected from the wide use of Standard Chinese, speakers from Beijing were understood more than speakers from elsewhere.
The scores supported a primary division between northern groups (Mandarin and Jin) and all others, with Min as an identifiable branch.

===Terminology===
Because speakers share a standard written form, and have a common cultural heritage with long periods of political unity, the varieties are popularly perceived among native speakers as variants of a single Chinese language, and this is also the official position. Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use &quot;dialect&quot; for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status), with regional groupings like Mandarin and Wu called &quot;dialect groups&quot;. Other linguists choose to refer to the major groups as languages. However, each of these groups contains mutually unintelligible varieties. ISO 639-3 and the &quot;Ethnologue&quot; assign language codes to each of the top-level groups listed above except Min and Pinghua, whose subdivisions are assigned five and two codes respectively. Some linguists refer to the local varieties as languages, numbering in the hundreds.

The Chinese term , literally &#x27;place speech&#x27;, was the title of the first work of Chinese dialectology in the Han dynasty, and has had a range of meanings in the millennia since. It is used for any regional subdivision of Chinese, from the speech of a village to major branches such as Mandarin and Wu. Linguists writing in Chinese often qualify the term to distinguish different levels of classification. All these terms have customarily been translated into English as &quot;dialect&quot;, a practice that has been criticized as confusing. The neologisms &quot;regionalect&quot; and &quot;topolect&quot; have been proposed as alternative renderings of .

==Phonology==

The usual unit of analysis is the syllable, traditionally analysed as consisting of an initial consonant, a final and a tone. In general, southern varieties have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants. Some varieties, such as Cantonese, Hokkien and Shanghainese, include syllabic nasals as independent syllables.

=== Initials ===
In the 42 varieties surveyed in the &quot;Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects&quot;, the number of initials (including a zero initial) ranges from 15 in some southern dialects to a high of 35 in Chongming dialect, spoken in Chongming Island, Shanghai.


The initial system of the Fuzhou dialect of northern Fujian is a minimal example. With the exception of , which is often merged with the zero initial, the initials of this dialect are present in all Chinese varieties, although several varieties do not distinguish from . However, most varieties have additional initials, due to a combination of innovations and retention of distinctions from Middle Chinese:
* Most non-Min varieties have a labiodental fricative , which developed from Middle Chinese bilabial stops in certain environments.
* The voiced initials of Middle Chinese are retained in Wu dialects such as Suzhou and Shanghai, as well as Old Xiang dialects and a few Gan dialects, but have merged with voiceless initials elsewhere. Southern Min varieties have an unrelated series of voiced initials resulting from devoicing of nasal initials in syllables without nasal finals.
* The Middle Chinese retroflex initials are retained in many Mandarin dialects, including Beijing but not southwestern and southeastern Mandarin varieties.
* In many northern and central varieties there is palatalization of dental affricates, velars (as in Suzhou), or both. In many places, including Beijing, palatalized dental affricates and palatalized velars have merged to form a new palatal series.

=== Finals ===

Chinese finals may be analysed as an optional medial glide, a main vowel and an optional coda.

Conservative vowel systems, such as those of Gan dialects, have high vowels , and , which also function as medials, mid vowels and , and a low -like vowel. In other dialects, including Mandarin dialects, has merged with , leaving a single mid vowel with a wide range of allophones. Many dialects, particularly in northern and central China, have apical or retroflex vowels, which are syllabic fricatives derived from high vowels following sibilant initials. In many Wu dialects, vowels and final glides have monophthongized, producing a rich inventory of vowels in open syllables. Reduction of medials is common in Yue dialects.

The Middle Chinese codas, consisting of glides and , nasals , and , and stops , and , are best preserved in southern dialects, particularly Yue dialects such as Cantonese. In some Min dialects, nasals and stops following open vowels have shifted to nasalization and glottal stops respectively. In Jin, Lower Yangtze Mandarin and Wu dialects, the stops have merged as a final glottal stop, while in most northern varieties they have disappeared. In Mandarin dialects final has merged with , while some central dialects have a single nasal coda, in some cases realized as a nasalization of the vowel.

===Tones===

All varieties of Chinese, like neighbouring languages in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, have phonemic tones. Each syllable may be pronounced with between three and seven distinct pitch contours, denoting different morphemes. For example, the Beijing dialect distinguishes (/ &#x27;mother&#x27;), ( &#x27;hemp&#x27;), (/ &#x27;horse) and (/ &#x27;to scold&#x27;). The number of tonal contrasts varies between dialects, with Northern dialects tending to have fewer distinctions than Southern ones. Many dialects have tone sandhi, in which the pitch contour of a syllable is affected by the tones of adjacent syllables in a compound word or phrase. This process is so extensive in Shanghainese that the tone system is reduced to a pitch accent system much like modern Japanese.

The tonal categories of modern varieties can be related by considering their derivation from the four tones of Middle Chinese, though cognate tonal categories in different dialects are often realized as quite different pitch contours. Middle Chinese had a three-way tonal contrast in syllables with vocalic or nasal endings. The traditional names of the tonal categories are &#x27;level&#x27;/&#x27;even&#x27; ( ), &#x27;rising&#x27; ( ) and &#x27;departing&#x27;/&#x27;going&#x27; ( ). Syllables ending in a stop consonant , or (checked syllables) had no tonal contrasts but were traditionally treated as a fourth tone category, &#x27;entering&#x27; ( ), corresponding to syllables ending in nasals , , or .

The tones of Middle Chinese, as well as similar systems in neighbouring languages, experienced a tone split conditioned by syllabic onsets. Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late Tang dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials, known as &quot;upper&quot; (/ ) and &quot;lower&quot; (/ ). When voicing was lost in all dialects except in the Wu and Old Xiang groups, this distinction became phonemic, yielding eight tonal categories, with a six-way contrast in unchecked syllables and a two-way contrast in checked syllables. Cantonese maintains these eight tonal categories and has developed an additional distinction in checked syllables. (The latter distinction has disappeared again in many varieties.)

However, most Chinese varieties have reduced the number of tonal distinctions. For example, in Mandarin, the tones resulting from the split of Middle Chinese rising and departing tones merged, leaving four tones. Furthermore, final stop consonants disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, and such syllables were distributed amongst the four remaining tones in a manner that is only partially predictable.

In Wu, voiced obstruents were retained, and the tone split never became phonemic: the higher-pitched allophones occur with initial voiceless consonants, and the lower-pitched allophones occur with initial voiced consonants. (Traditional Chinese classification nonetheless counts these as different tones.) Most Wu dialects retain the tone categories of Middle Chinese, but in Shanghainese several of these have merged.

Many Chinese varieties exhibit tone sandhi, in which the realization of a tone varies depending on the context of the syllable. For example, in Standard Chinese a third tone changes to a second tone when followed by another third tone. Particularly complex sandhi patterns are found in Wu dialects and coastal Min dialects. In Shanghainese, the tone of all syllables in a word is determined by the tone of the first, so that Shanghainese has word rather than syllable tone.

In northern varieties, many particles or suffixes are weakly stressed or atonic syllables. These are much rarer in southern varieties. Such syllables have a reduced pitch range that is determined by the preceding syllable.

==Vocabulary==
Most morphemes in Chinese varieties are monosyllables descended from Old Chinese words, and have cognates in all varieties:

Southern varieties also include distinctive substrata of vocabulary of non-Chinese origin. Some of these words may have come from Tai–Kadai and Austroasiatic languages.

== Grammar ==

Chinese varieties generally lack inflectional morphology and instead express grammatical categories using analytic means such as particles and prepositions.
There are major differences between northern and southern varieties, but often some northern areas share features found in the south, and vice versa.

=== Constituent order ===
The usual unmarked word order in Chinese varieties is subject–verb–object, with other orders used for emphasis or contrast.
Modifiers usually precede the word they modify, so that adjectives precede nouns.
Instances in which the modifier follows the head are mainly found in the south,
and are attributed to substrate influences from languages formerly dominant in the area, especially Kra–Dai languages.
* Adverbs generally precede verbs, but in some southern varieties certain kinds of adverb follow the verb.
* In the north, animal gender markers are prefixed to the noun, as in Beijing (/) &#x27;hen&#x27; and (/) &#x27;rooster&#x27;, but most southern varieties use the reverse order, while others use different orders for different words.
* Compounds consisting of an attributive following a noun are less common, but some are found in the south as well as a few northern areas.

=== Nominals ===

Nouns in Chinese varieties are generally not marked for number.
As in languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, Chinese varieties require an intervening classifier when a noun is preceded by a demonstrative or numeral.
The inventory of classifiers tends to be larger in the south than in the north, where some varieties use only the general classifier cognate with /.

First- and second-person pronouns are cognate across all varieties. For third-person pronouns, Jin, Mandarin, and Xiang varieties have cognate forms, but other varieties generally use forms that originally had a velar or glottal initial:

Plural personal pronouns may be marked with a suffix, noun or phrase in different varieties. The suffix / is common in the north, but several different suffixes are use elsewhere.
In some varieties, especially in the Wu area, different suffixes are used for first, second and third person pronouns.
Case is not marked, except in varieties in the Qinghai–Gansu sprachbund.

The forms of demonstratives vary greatly, with few cognates between different areas.
A two-way distinction between proximal and distal is most common, but some varieties have a single neutral demonstrative, while others distinguish three or more on the basis of distance, visibility or other properties. An extreme example is found in a variety spoken in Yongxin County, Jiangxi, where five grades of distance are distinguished.

Attributive constructions typically have the form NP/VP + + NP, where the last noun phrase is the head and the attributive marker is usually a cognate of in the north or a classifier in the south.
The latter pattern is also common in the languages of Southeast Asia.
A few varieties in the Jiang–Huai, Wu, southern Min and Yue areas feature the old southern pattern of a zero attributive marker.
Nominalization of verb phrases or predicates is achieved by following them with a marker, usually the same as the attributive marker, though some varieties use a different marker.

=== Major sentence types ===

All varieties have transitive and intransitive verbs.
Instead of adjectives, Chinese varieties use stative verbs, which can function as predicates but differ from intransitive verbs in being modifiable by degree adverbs.
Ditransitive sentences vary, with northern varieties placing the indirect object before the direct object and southern varieties using the reverse order.

All varieties have copular sentences of the form NP1 + + NP2, though the copula varies.
Most Yue and Hakka varieties use a form cognate with &#x27;to connect&#x27;.
All other varieties use a form cognate with , which was a demonstrative in Classical Chinese but began to be used as a copula from the Han period.

All varieties form existential sentences with a verb cognate with , which can also be used as a transitive verb indicating possession.
Most varieties use a locative verb cognate to , but Min, Wu and Yue varieties use several different forms.

All varieties allow sentences of the form NP + VP1 + + VP2, with a verbal complement VP2 containing a stative verb describing the manner or extent of the main verb.
In northern varieties, the marker is a cognate of , but many southern varieties distinguish between manner and extent complements using different markers.
Standard Chinese does not allow an object to co-occur with a verbal complement, but other varieties permit an object between the marker and the complement.

A characteristic feature of Chinese varieties is &quot;in situ&quot; questions:
* Open questions are formed by replacing the desired information with an interrogative word, though the words vary between different areas.
* Yes–no questions are formed by appending a particle to the sentence.
This particle is a cognate of / in the north, but varies between other varieties.
Other question forms are also common:
* Most varieties have neutral questions employing the form V + + V, repeating the same verb. When the verb takes an object, some northwestern Mandarin varieties tend to place it after the first occurrence of the verb, while other Mandarin varieties and most southern varieties place it after the second occurrence.
* Most varieties form disjunctive questions by placing a conjunction between the alternatives, though some also use particles to mark the disjuncts. Standard Chinese is unusual in allowing a form with no conjunction.

=== Verb phrases ===

A sentence is negated by placing a marker before the verb. Old Chinese had two families of negation markers starting with and , respectively. Northern and Central varieties tend to use a word from the first family, cognate with Beijing , as the ordinary negator. A word from the second family is used as an existential negator &#x27;have not&#x27;, as in Beijing and Shanghai . In Mandarin varieties this word is also used for &#x27;not yet&#x27;, whereas in Wu and other groups a different form is typically used. In Southern varieties, negators tend to come from the second family. The ordinary negators in these varieties are all derived from a syllabic nasal , though it has a level tone in Hakka and Yue and a rising tone in Min. Existential negators derive from a proto-form , though again the tonal category varies between groups.

Chinese varieties generally indicate the roles of nouns with respect to verbs using prepositions derived from grammaticalized verbs.
Varieties differ in the set of prepositions used, with northern varieties tending to use a substantially larger inventory, including disyllabic and trisyllabic prepositions.
In northern varieties, the preposition may be used to move the object before the verb (the &quot;disposal&quot; construction).
Similar structures using several different prepositions are used in the south, but tend to be avoided in more colloquial speech.
Comparative constructions are expressed with a prepositional phrase before the stative verb in most northern and central varieties, as well as Northern Min and Hakka, while other southern varieties retain the older form in which the prepositional phrase follows the stative verb.
The preposition is usually in the north, with other forms used elsewhere.

Chinese varieties tend to indicate aspect using markers following the main verb.
The markers, usually derived from verbs, vary widely in both their forms and their degree of grammaticalization, from independent verbs, through complements to bound suffixes.
Southern varieties tend to have richer aspect systems making more distinctions than northern ones.

==Sociolinguistics==

===Bilingualism and code-switching===

In southern China (not including Hong Kong and Macau), where the difference between Standard Chinese and local dialects is particularly pronounced, well-educated Chinese are generally fluent in Standard Chinese, and most people have at least a good passive knowledge of it, in addition to being native speakers of the local dialect. The choice of dialect varies based on the social situation. Standard Chinese is usually considered more formal and is required when speaking to a person who does not understand the local dialect. The local dialect (be it non-Standard Chinese or non-Mandarin altogether) is generally considered more intimate and is used among close family members and friends and in everyday conversation within the local area. Chinese speakers will frequently code switch between Standard Chinese and the local dialect. Parents will generally speak to their children in the local variety, and the relationship between dialect and Mandarin appears to be mostly stable, even a diglossia. Local dialects are valued as symbols of regional cultures.

People generally are tied to the hometown and therefore the hometown dialect, instead of a broad linguistic classification. For example, a person from Wuxi may claim that he speaks Wuxi dialect, even though it is similar to Shanghainese (another Wu dialect). Likewise, a person from Xiaogan may claim that he speaks Xiaogan dialect. Linguistically, Xiaogan dialect is a dialect of Mandarin, but the pronunciation and diction are quite different from spoken Standard Chinese.

Knowing the local dialect is of considerable social benefit, and most Chinese who permanently move to a new area will attempt to pick up the local dialect. Learning a new dialect is usually done informally through a process of immersion and recognizing sound shifts. Generally the differences are more pronounced lexically than grammatically. Typically, a speaker of one dialect of Chinese will need about a year of immersion to understand the local dialect and about three to five years to become fluent in speaking it. Because of the variety of dialects spoken, there are usually few formal methods for learning a local dialect.

Due to the variety in Chinese speech, Mandarin speakers from each area of China are very often prone to fuse or &quot;translate&quot; words from their local language into their Mandarin conversations. In addition, each area of China has its recognizable accents while speaking Mandarin. Generally, the nationalized standard form of Mandarin pronunciation is only heard on news and radio broadcasts. Even in the streets of Beijing, the flavor of Mandarin varies in pronunciation from the Mandarin heard on the media.

In Taiwan, as most people at least understand, if not speak, Taiwanese Hokkien, Taiwanese Mandarin has acquired many loanwords from Hokkien. Some of these are directly implanted into Mandarin, as in the case of &quot;蚵仔煎,&quot; &quot;oyster omelet&quot;, which most Taiwanese people would call by its Hokkien name (ô-á-tsian) rather than its Mandarin one (é-zǐ-jiān). In other cases, Mandarin creates new words to imitate Hokkien ones, as in the case of &quot;哇靠,&quot; (&quot;damn&quot;) from the Hokkien &quot;goák-hàu&quot;, but pronounced in Mandarin as &quot;wā-kào&quot;.

While most Taiwanese people understand Hokkien, far fewer understand or speak Hakka, and Taiwanese Mandarin therefore contains fewer Hakka loanwords. Formerly, there was a misconception among linguists that language in Taiwan was primarily tied to ethnicity (i.e., Minnan people speak Hokkien, Hakka people speak Hakka, and Indigenous people speak the language corresponding to their tribe). Researchers later realized that, although it is true that most Minnan people speak Hokkien, most Hakka people also speak Hokkien and many of them do not speak Hakka. Hokkien remains the most prestigious language other than Mandarin and English in Taiwan. Although Hokkien, Hakka, and Taiwan&#x27;s many Indigenous languages have now been elevated to the status of national languages, it is notable that there is a clear de facto gradient of valuation of these languages. For instance, on the Taipei metro when nearing the next station, a passenger will hear these languages in the following order: Mandarin, English, Hokkien, Hakka, sometimes followed by Japanese and Korean.

===Language policy===
====Mainland China====

Within mainland China, there has been a persistent Promotion of Putonghua drive; for instance, the education system is entirely Mandarin-medium from the second year onward. However, usage of local dialect is tolerated and socially preferred in many informal situations. In Hong Kong, written Cantonese is not used in formal documents, and within the PRC a character set closer to Mandarin tends to be used. At the national level, differences in dialect generally do not correspond to political divisions or categories, and this has for the most part prevented dialect from becoming the basis of identity politics.

Historically, many of the people who promoted Chinese nationalism were from southern China and did not natively speak Mandarin, and even leaders from northern China rarely spoke with the standard accent. Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Yat-sen were also from southern China, and this is reflected in their conventional English names reflecting Cantonese pronunciations for their given names, and differing from their pinyin spellings and . One consequence of this is that China does not have a well-developed tradition of spoken political rhetoric, and most Chinese political works are intended primarily as written works rather than spoken works. Another factor that limits the political implications of dialect is that it is very common within an extended family for different people to know and use different dialects.

====Taiwan====

Before 1945, most of the population of Taiwan were Han Chinese, some of whom spoke Japanese, in addition to Taiwanese Hokkien or Hakka, with a minority of Taiwanese aborigines, who spoke Formosan languages. When the Kuomintang retreated to the island after losing the Chinese Civil War in 1949, they brought a substantial influx of speakers of Northern Chinese (and other dialects from across China), and viewed the use of Mandarin as part of their claim to be a legitimate government of the whole of China. Education policy promoted the use of Mandarin over the local languages, and was implemented especially rigidly in elementary schools, with punishments and public humiliation for children using other languages at school.

From the 1970s, the government promoted adult education in Mandarin, required Mandarin for official purposes, and encouraged its increased use in broadcasting. Over a 40-year period, these policies succeeded in spreading the use and prestige of Mandarin through society at the expense of the other languages. They also aggravated social divisions, as Mandarin speakers found it difficult to find jobs in private companies but were favored for government positions. From the 1990s, Taiwanese languages (Taiwanese Hokkien, Taiwanese Hakka and the Formosan languages) were offered in elementary and middle schools, first in Yilan county, then in other areas governed by elected Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians, and finally throughout the island.

====Singapore====

In 1966, the Singaporean government implemented a policy of bilingual education, where Singaporean students learn both English and their designated native language, which was Mandarin for Chinese Singaporeans (even though Singaporean Hokkien had previously been their &quot;lingua franca&quot;). The &quot;Goh Report&quot;, an evaluation of Singapore&#x27;s education system by Goh Keng Swee, showed that less than 40% of the student population managed to attain minimum levels of competency in two languages. It was later determined that the learning of Mandarin among Singaporean Chinese was hindered by home use of other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, and Hakka. Hence, the government decided to rectify problems facing implementation of the bilingual education policy, by launching a campaign to promote Mandarin as a common language among the Chinese population, and to discourage use of other Chinese varieties.

Launched in 1979 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the campaign aimed to simplify the language environment for Chinese Singaporeans, improve communication between them, and create a Mandarin-speaking environment conducive to the successful implementation of the bilingual education program. The initial goal of the campaign was for all young Chinese to stop speaking dialects in five years, and to establish Mandarin as the language of choice in public places within 10 years. According to the government, for the bilingual policy to be effective, Mandarin should be spoken at home and should serve as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; among Chinese Singaporeans. They also argued that Mandarin was more economically valuable, and speaking Mandarin would help Chinese Singaporeans retain their heritage, as Mandarin contains a cultural repository of values and traditions that are identifiable to all Chinese, regardless of dialect group.

<text>Milagros Ninette Corretjer Maldonado, known as Millie Corretjer
(born April 18, 1974), is a Puerto Rican singer and actress. She was married to former professional boxer Oscar De La Hoya. She is the granddaughter of influential poet and one-time Secretary General of the pro-independence Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, Juan Antonio Corretjer.

==Early life==
Corretjer was born on April 18, 1974, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Jesús Francisco Corretjer and Milagros Maldonado. Her paternal grandfather was poet and activist Juan Antonio Corretjer Montes, with her paternal great-great grandfather Antoni Corretjer Caire originally from Pineda de Mar, Province of Barcelona, Spain. 

At the age of 15, Corretjer hosted the Puerto Rican television show &quot;La Ola Nueva&quot; (&quot;&quot;The New Wave&quot;).

==Musical career==
In 1995, she released the album &quot;Sola&quot; (&quot;Alone&quot;&quot;), which sent three of her songs to the &quot;Billboard&quot; lists. The album featured Spanish versions of Selena songs, &quot;Where Did the Feeling Go?&quot;, which was called &quot;Donde te has ido amor&quot;, and &quot;Only Love&quot;, called &quot;Solo tu&quot;, and received a nomination for a Lo Nuestro Award for Best New Artist.

In 1997, Corretjer released her second album, &quot;Emociones&quot; (&quot;Emotions&quot;).

Her third album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Amar es un Juego&quot;, earned her a gold album in Puerto Rico; her song &quot;De Hoy en Adelante&quot; (&quot;From Today On&quot;) ranked number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for more than six weeks. 

Corretjer and her music became well known in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil (where she lived for six months) and other Latin American countries, as well as in the United States.

Corretjer re-took her singing career in 2020, recording a video of one of her new songs, called &quot;Si yo Fuera Tu&quot; (&quot;If I Were You&quot;) by herself and by using an iPhone.

==Marriage and children==
In 2000, Oscar De La Hoya recorded his first music album. In the studio, while trying to record songs for his album, he was finding it difficult to sing with more passion. To demonstrate passionate singing, his producer Rudy Perez showed him &quot;Una Voz en el Alma&quot;, one of Corretjer&#x27;s music videos from the previous album, which he had produced. De La Hoya asked for the name of the singer in the video, and the producer replied that she was a singer and actress named Millie Corretjer, who had previously worked with him.

De La Hoya asked that Corretjer be the model in his next music video. After meeting each other on an EMI convention in Texas, the two fell in love and began dating. They were married on October 5, 2001, in a secret ceremony in San Juan.

Corretjer made an appearance in De La Hoya&#x27;s video &quot;Para Que&quot;, and years later he did the same for Corretjer&#x27;s video &quot;En Cuerpo y Alma&quot;.

Corretjer has three children, a son, Oscar Gabriel De La Hoya (born December 29, 2005) and two daughters, Nina Lauren Nenitte De La Hoya (born December 29, 2007) and Victoria Lauren Rose De La Hoya (born January 14, 2014). She also has three former stepchildren through De La Hoya, all from his previous relationships: two ex-stepsons, Jacob De La Hoya (born February 18, 1998) and Devon De La Hoya (born November 30, 1998), and an ex-stepdaughter, Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya (born March 29, 1999).

In 2016, Corretjer and De La Hoya split.

<text>Mayberry is a fictional community that was the setting for two popular American television sitcoms, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1960–1968) and &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; (1968–1971); Mayberry was also the setting for a 1986 reunion television film titled &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;. The town is also frequently mentioned in the spin-off program &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, and is seen when Pyle returns to visit his home town. Mayberry is said to be based on Andy Griffith&#x27;s hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina. Mount Airy is also known as Mayberry and called by both names by its residents.

==The name &quot;Mayberry&quot;==
According to show episodes, the community of Mayberry was named for fictional founder John Mayberry. In the 1964 episode “The Pageant,” Mayberry celebrates its centennial, implying its founding was in 1864. Purportedly, Andy Griffith himself chose the name of the fictional community. Griffith, however, told Larry King in 2003 that Artie Stander is the person who thought of the name Mayberry; Stander was one of the show&#x27;s creators and writers.

&quot;Mayberry&quot; is mentioned many times in television shows such as &quot;Cheers, House, Criminal Minds, Supernatural, How I Met Your Mother, FROM&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and &quot;Scrubs&quot;. According to the episode &quot;The Battle of Mayberry,&quot; the town was almost named Taylortown in honor of Colonel Carleton Taylor, who was one of the first settlers in the town.

==Specific features==
Mayberry had one traffic light and little in the way of indigenous crime with the exception perhaps of moonshining and bootlegging. Speeding was also mentioned in the area, like that on Highway 6 in the fourth season episode &quot;Barney&#x27;s Sidecar.&quot; Out-of-town bank robbers, scam artists, escaped convicts, and vagrants occasionally found their way to Mayberry. The county and the town share the same name and jurisdiction. In episode 44 &quot;Sheriff Barney,&quot; the mayor of nearby Greendale relates that Mayberry County has had the lowest crime rate in the state for two years in a row under Sheriff Taylor. The town only had one long-distance telephone line, as referenced in the episode &quot;Man in a Hurry,&quot; that two old ladies shared each Sunday preventing others from using the telephone.

In the opening scene of season 8, episode 30 (the last episode), a sign at the railroad station lists the population and elevation of Mayberry:
:Population: 5,360
:Elevation: 671
However, this conflicts with the comment made by choir director John Masters to Andy Taylor, that &quot;there&#x27;s got to be a decent tenor in a town of two-thousand people&quot; in the episode &quot;The Song Festers&quot; – season 4, episode 20. And, in season 7, episode 23 (&quot;The Statue&quot;), Howard Sprague refers to a population of 1,800.

==Archetypal small town==
=== Real-life models ===
Many assume Mayberry was loosely based on Andy Griffith&#x27;s hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina, but actually, Griffith has indicated that nearby Pilot Mountain, also in Surry County, North Carolina, inspired him in creating the town. Pilot Mountain likely was the inspiration for the fictional town of &quot;Mount Pilot,&quot; a nearby larger town in relation to Mayberry, often referred to and occasionally visited by the characters in &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. The county seat of Surry County is in Dobson; thus, this is the location of the nearest courthouse to Mount Airy. One episode has a fictional nearby location – &quot;Pierce County.&quot; Another episode has Barney Fife referring to Sheriff Taylor and himself as &quot;the law west of Mount Pilot&quot;.

Other place names used in the show refer to actual places in North Carolina, such as Raleigh—which was also often called &quot;Capital City&quot; – Siler City, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Chapel Hill, Stokes County, Elm City and Charlotte. One of the stars of the show, Frances Bavier (who played Aunt Bee) retired to Siler City in real life. (Betty Lynn who played Thelma Lou retired to Mount Airy).

In episode 248 &quot;A Girl for Goober,&quot; the towns of Manteo and Toast are mentioned. Andy Griffith owned a home in Manteo (on North Carolina&#x27;s Atlantic coast), and Toast is about two miles outside of Mt. Airy in Surry County. Stokes County, which borders Surry County to the east, is mentioned as the location of Myers Lake in episode 140 &quot;Andy and Helen Have Their Day.&quot;

In episode 62 &quot;Cousin Virgil,&quot; the bus picks up Barney&#x27;s cousin in Currituck. A Currituck County is located in eastern North Carolina.

In episode 17 &quot;Alcohol and Old Lace&quot; while looking for moonshine stills, Barney suggests looking into Fancy Gap, Virginia, a town just across the state line from Mt. Airy.

In episode 60 &quot;Bookie Barber,&quot; Aunt Bee states that Floyd&#x27;s Barber Shop has received phone calls from as far away as Morehead City.

In episode 136 &quot;Opie&#x27;s Fortune,&quot; a man from Bannertown lost $50. Bannertown is a few miles from Mt. Airy in Surry County.

In episode 68 &quot;Barney Mends a Broken Heart,&quot; the towns of Harnett and Yancey are mentioned. Both a Harnett County and a Yancey County are in North Carolina. In episode 3 &quot;The Guitar Player&quot; played by James Best, who later played Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard,&quot; Best&#x27;s character Jim Lindsey buys his guitar picks in Winston-Salem, which is actually the nearest big city to Mount Airy (37 miles).

In Season 4, Episode 3 of &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, (“Corporal Carol”) Gomer tells the corporal (played by Carol Burnett) that he is from Mayberry, North Carolina, “just a little bitty town about 30 miles outside of Raleigh.“

===Origins and expansion===
Mayberry originated in an episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; and was the setting for &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, and the 1986 reunion film &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;.

===Eponymous real-life community===
Mayberry is the name of a real community in Patrick County, Virginia; located 22 miles northeast of Andy Griffith&#x27;s hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina. The Mayberry Trading Post, home of the Mayberry, Virginia post office until it closed in 1922, told local TV station WGHP that Griffith and his father made many trips to the Mayberry Trading Post.

==Town landmarks==
=== Public buildings ===
* The Mayberry Courthouse – Was where Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife maintained law and order. It also contained the county jail—two cells, a back room, and the mayor&#x27;s office upstairs. No inside stairs are seen, although there is an outside fire escape. Aside from Andy Taylor&#x27;s home, this was the main setting for &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.
* Mayberry Security Bank – The town&#x27;s only bank, was often subject to robberies. It contains a large vault, and its only security guard is a senile man named Asa, who is constantly sleeping and whose fall-apart dilapidated gun is filled with moldy bullets. An interesting plot hole about the vault: in one episode, the vault combination was lost so an extra door was put in the vault. But in another episode, Barney Fife gets himself locked in the safe and only escapes by breaking the wall between the vault and the next-door beauty parlor.
* Mayberry Union High School – The high school from which Andy and Barney graduated in 1948. In the episode &quot;The Return of Barney Fife&quot;, which originally aired 01/10/1966, Barney and Andy attend their high school reunion. Behind the small orchestra playing during the dance hangs a banner that reads &quot;Welcome Class of &#x27;48&quot;. However, in the episode &quot;Class Reunion&quot;, which originally aired 02/04/1963 Andy and Barney organize a class reunion in which the banner reads &quot;Class of &#x27;45&quot;.
* U.S. Post Office – The town&#x27;s only post office.

=== Houses ===
* Taylor House – Humble, yet handsome, two-story frame house at 332 Maple Road (though once noted by Barney to be on Elm St.), a short walk from the courthouse. Notable features include a front porch perfect for conversation and guitar playing, a back porch with an extra freezer, and a living room with a high ceiling and rough-hewn (rusticated ashlar) stone fireplace.
* Mrs. Mendalbright&#x27;s Rooming House – Barney Fife boards upstairs and his landlady is Mrs. Mendalbright.
* Thelma Lou&#x27;s House – The home of Thelma Lou, Barney&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Helen Crump&#x27;s House – The home of Helen Crump, Andy&#x27;s girlfriend and Opie&#x27;s teacher.
* Mrs. Wiley&#x27;s House – The home of Mrs. Wiley, which is frequently subject to parties, two of which were crashed by Ernest T. Bass.
* The Rimshaw House – The &quot;haunted&quot; house of the deceased Old Man Rimshaw where Otis Campbell and Big Jack Anderson were running a still.

=== Entertainment/religious venues ===
* All Souls Church – also known as Community Church – Was the non-denominational Protestant church the Taylors and other townspeople attended in Mayberry. It could seat around 40 people and a choir. The church hosted an annual picnic and an annual bazaar.

=== Commercial establishments ===

* Fleur De Lis Beauty Salon – Located just down Main Street from the Mayberry Courthouse and Walker&#x27;s Drugstore.
* Floyd&#x27;s Barber Shop – Run by the scatterbrained Floyd Lawson, it was the main center of action in Mayberry. On any given day, it was not unusual to see many of the town&#x27;s important figures, including the mayor and the sheriff, gathered here.
* H. Goss, Tailor - Owned by Fred Goss, a tailor who also does dry cleaning.
* Monroe&#x27;s Funeral Parlor – Owned by city councilman Orville Monroe who also repairs TV&#x27;s at Monroe&#x27;s TV Repair when the funeral business is slow.
* Simmons Seeds – Run by Mr. Simmons.
* F. Wakefield Beauty Salon – Located on Main Street across Luken&#x27;s, where Aunt Bee and Clara Johnson get their hair done.
* Walker&#x27;s Drug Store – This was the town drug store and soda shop owned by Fred Walker. His niece Ellie (Elinor Donahue), also a pharmacist, worked there for a while and was Andy&#x27;s first girlfriend on the show. In the early episodes, characters often talked about &quot;going to Walker&#x27;s for an ice cream soda.&quot;
* Wally&#x27;s Filling Station – The town&#x27;s only known gas station, it employed cousins Gomer and Goober Pyle. It also served as the town&#x27;s auto repair garage.

=== Places to shop ===
* Foley&#x27;s Grocery – also known as Crowley&#x27;s Market – The main grocery store in Mayberry frequented by many of the ladies in town. It was located across from the Mayberry Hotel. Mr. Foley is the owner of the store, but apparently tasks Art Crowley with running day-to-day operations.
* Luken&#x27;s Style Shop – Small boutique located on Main Street operated by Mrs. Lukens.
* Morrison Sisters Flower Shop – Owned by sisters Clarabelle and Jennifer Morrison who also run a moonshine still.

* Mayberry Diner – The main restaurant in Mayberry that Barney and Andy frequent for its inexpensive daily specials.
* Morelli&#x27;s – A more upscale restaurant outside of town. Known for its special dinner, the pounded steak supper, &quot;pounded on the premises.&quot;
* Snappy Lunch – Diner named after a real eatery that still serves lunch in Mount Airy, North Carolina.

=== Lodging ===
* Mayberry Hotel – Where out-of-towners often stayed, the Mayberry Hotel was also where choir director John Masters was employed.

=== Physical landmarks ===
* Myer&#x27;s Lake – As seen in the opening credits of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, it was the place Andy and Opie Taylor went fishing, and where Barney often drove with Thelma Lou for their &quot;romantic getaways&quot;. The fictional lake was mentioned on the show as being located in Stokes County, North Carolina. Stokes County is a real county next to Surry County where Andy Griffith was born and raised. Franklin Canyon Park was used for filming.

== In popular culture ==
Due to the success and fame of the television show, &quot;Mayberry&quot; has been used as a term for both idyllic small-town life and for rural simplicity (for both good and ill).

In a song by Rascal Flatts titled &quot;Mayberry&quot;, the town is mentioned: &quot;Well I miss Mayberry sitting on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry Coke where everything is black and white.&quot;

In the Lynyrd Skynyrd song “Simple Life” (from the album &quot;God &amp; Guns&quot;), there’s a line in the lyrics: “…put my feet up, watch a rerun on TV,
Laughing with Ole Barney, Andy and Aunt Bee…”.

In the song called &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Interview&quot; on the Neil Young album &quot;Greendale&quot;: &quot;Shows with love and affection, Like mama used to say, A little Mayberry livin&#x27;, Can go a long way.&quot;

In the film &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; the character Helen Shivers refers to a sceptical local cop who refuses to believe her warnings as a “Mayberry ass reject” in exasperation.

&quot;Home&quot;, the second episode of the fourth season of the television show &quot;The X-Files&quot;, makes frequent references to Mayberry because of the size of the town in which the investigation takes place.

In the song &quot;High-Tech Redneck&quot; on the George Jones album of the same name, the town is mentioned: &quot;He&#x27;s a high-tech redneck, Mayberry meets Startrek.&quot;

In the fifth episode of the seventh season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, Doug refers to Wisteria Lane as ‘Mayberry’ due to the apparent idyllic suburbs where the show is set.

<text>Sword-and-sandal, also known as peplum (: pepla), is a subgenre of largely Italian-made historical, mythological, or biblical epics mostly set in the Greco-Roman antiquity or the Middle Ages. These films attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949), &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963). These films dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965, eventually being replaced in 1965 by spaghetti Western and Eurospy films.

The term &quot;peplum&quot; (a Latin word referring to the ancient Greek garment &quot;peplos&quot;) was introduced by French film critics in the 1960s. The terms &quot;peplum&quot; and &quot;sword-and-sandal&quot; were used in a condescending way by film critics. Later, the terms were embraced by fans of the films, similar to the terms &quot;spaghetti Western&quot; or &quot;shoot-&#x27;em-ups&quot;. In their English versions, peplum films can be immediately differentiated from their Hollywood counterparts by their use of &quot;clumsy and inadequate&quot; English language dubbing. A 100-minute documentary on the history of Italy&#x27;s peplum genre was produced and directed by Antonio Avati in 1977 titled &quot;Kolossal: i magnifici Macisti&quot; (aka &quot;Kino Kolossal&quot;).

==Genre characteristics==
Sword-and-sandal films are a specific class of Italian adventure films that have subjects set in Biblical or classical antiquity, often with plots based more or less loosely on Greco-Roman history or the other contemporary cultures of the time, such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Etruscans, as well as medieval times. Not all of the films were fantasy-based by any means. Many of the plots featured actual historical personalities such as Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, and Hannibal, although great liberties were taken with the storylines. Gladiators and slaves rebelling against tyrannical rulers, pirates and swashbucklers were also popular subjects.

As Robert Rushing defines it, peplum, &quot;in its most stereotypical form, [...] depicts muscle-bound heroes (professional bodybuilders, athletes, wrestlers, or brawny actors) in mythological antiquity, fighting fantastic monsters and saving scantily clad beauties. Rather than lavish epics set in the classical world, they are low-budget films that focus on the hero&#x27;s extraordinary body.&quot; Thus, most sword-and-sandal films featured a superhumanly strong man as the protagonist, such as Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Ursus or Italy&#x27;s own popular folk hero Maciste. In addition, the plots typically involved two women vying for the affection of the bodybuilder hero: the good love interest (a damsel in distress needing rescue), and an evil femme fatale queen who sought to dominate the hero.

Also, the films typically featured an ambitious ruler who would ascend the throne by murdering those who stood in his path, and often it was only the muscular hero who could depose him. Thus the hero&#x27;s often political goal: &quot;to restore a legitimate sovereign against an evil dictator.&quot;

Many of the peplum films involved a clash between two populations, one civilized and the other barbaric, which typically included a scene of a village or city being burned to the ground by invaders. For their musical content, most films contained a colorful dancing girls sequence, meant to underline pagan decadence.

==Precursors of the sword-and-sandal wave (pre-1958)==
===Italian films of the silent era===
Italian filmmakers paved the way for the peplum genre with some of the earliest silent films dealing with the subject, including the following:
* &quot;The Sack of Rome&quot; (1905)
* &quot;Agrippina&quot; (1911)
* &quot;The Fall of Troy&quot; (1911)
* &quot;The Queen of Nineveh&quot; (1911, directed by Luigi Maggi)
* &quot;Brutus&quot; (1911)
* &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1913, directed by Enrico Guazzoni)
* &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1913)
* &quot;Cabiria&quot; (1914, directed by Giovanni Pastrone)
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1914)
* &quot;Saffo&quot; (&quot;Sappho&quot;, 1918, directed by Antonio Molinari)
* &quot;The Crusaders&quot; (1918)
* &quot;Fabiola&quot; (1918) directed by Enrico Guazzoni
* &quot;Attila&quot; (1918, directed by F. Mari)
* &quot;Venere&quot; (&quot;Venus&quot;, 1919, directed by Antonio Molinari)
* &quot;Il mistero di Osiris&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of Osiris&quot;, 1919) directed by Antonio Molinari
* &quot;Giuliano l&#x27;Apostata&quot; (1919, directed by Ugo Falena)
* &quot;Giuditta e Oloferne&quot; (&quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot;, 1920) directed by Antonio Molinari
* &quot;The Sack of Rome&quot;, (1920) directed by Enrico Guazzoni
* &quot;Samson (1923 film)&quot;
* &quot;Messalina&quot;, (1924) directed by Enrico Guazzoni
* &quot;Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei&quot; (&quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1926) directed by Carmine Gallone and Amleto Palermi)

===The silent Maciste films (1914–1927)===
The 1914 Italian silent film &quot;Cabiria&quot; was one of the first films set in antiquity to make use of a massively muscled character, Maciste (played by actor Bartolomeo Pagano), who served in this premiere film as the hero&#x27;s slavishly loyal sidekick. Maciste became the public&#x27;s favorite character in the film however, and Pagano was called back many times to reprise the role. The Maciste character appeared in at least two dozen Italian silent films from 1914 through 1926, all of which featured a protagonist named Maciste although the films were set in many different time periods and geographical locations.

Here is a complete list of the silent Maciste films in chronological order:
* &quot;Cabiria&quot; (1914) introduced the Maciste character
* &quot;Maciste&quot; (1915) &quot;The Marvelous Maciste&quot;
* &quot;Maciste bersagliere&quot; (&quot;Maciste the Ranger&quot;, 1916)
* &quot;Maciste alpino&quot; (&quot;Maciste The Warrior&quot;, 1916)
* &quot;Maciste atleta&quot; (&quot;Maciste the Athlete&quot;, 1917)
* &quot;Maciste medium&quot; (&quot;Maciste the Clairvoyant&quot;, 1917)
* &quot;Maciste poliziotto&quot; (&quot;Maciste the Detective&quot;, 1917)
* &quot;Maciste turista&quot; (&quot;Maciste the Tourist&quot;, 1917)
* &quot;Maciste sonnambulo&quot; (&quot;Maciste the Sleepwalker&quot;, 1918)
* &quot;La Rivincita di Maciste&quot; (&quot;The Revenge of Maciste&quot;, 1919)
* &quot;Il Testamento di Maciste&quot; (&quot;Maciste&#x27;s Will&quot;, 1919)
* &quot;Il Viaggio di Maciste&quot; (&quot;Maciste&#x27;s Journey&quot;, 1919)
* &quot;Maciste I&quot; (&quot;Maciste the First&quot;, 1919)
* &quot;Maciste contro la morte&quot; (&quot;Maciste vs Death&quot;, 1919)
* &quot;Maciste innamorato&quot; (&quot;Maciste in Love&quot;, 1919)
* &quot;Maciste in vacanza&quot; (&quot;Maciste on Vacation&quot;, 1920)
* &quot;Maciste salvato dalle acque&quot; (&quot;Maciste Rescued from the Waters&quot;, 1920)
* &quot;Maciste e la figlia del re della plata&quot; (&quot;Maciste and the Silver King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, 1922)
* &quot;Maciste und die Japanerin&quot; (&quot;Maciste and the Japanese&quot;, 1922)
* &quot;Maciste contro Maciste&quot; (&quot;Maciste vs. Maciste&quot;, 1923)
* &quot;Maciste und die chinesische truhe&quot; (&quot;Maciste and the Chinese Trunk&quot;, 1923)
* &quot;Maciste e il nipote di America&quot; (&quot;Maciste&#x27;s American Nephew&quot;, 1924)
* &quot;Maciste imperatore&quot; (&quot;Emperor Maciste&quot;, 1924)
* &quot;Maciste contro lo sceicco&quot; (&quot;Maciste vs. the Sheik&quot;, 1925)
* &quot;Maciste all&#x27;inferno&quot; (&quot;Maciste in Hell&quot;, 1925)
* &quot;Maciste nella gabbia dei leoni&quot; (&quot;Maciste in the Lions&#x27; Den&quot;, 1926)
* &quot;il Gigante delle Dolemite&quot; (&quot;The Giant From the Dolomite&quot;, released in 1927)

===Italian fascist and post-war historical epics (1937-1956)===
The Italian film industry released several historical films in the early sound era, such as the big-budget &quot;Scipione l&#x27;Africano&quot; (&quot;Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal&quot;) in 1937, written by Mussolini&#x27;s son Vittorio, and heavily financed by his fascist government. In 1949, the postwar Italian film industry remade &quot;Fabiola&quot; (which had been previously filmed twice in the silent era). The film was released in the United Kingdom and in the United States in 1951 in an edited, English-dubbed version. &quot;Fabiola&quot; was an Italian-French co-production similar to &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1950) and &quot;Messalina&quot; (1951).

During the 1950s, a number of American historical epics shot in Italy were released. In 1951, MGM producer Sam Zimbalist cleverly used the lower production costs, use of frozen funds and the expertise of the Italian film industry to shoot the large-scale Technicolor epic &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in Rome. In addition to its fictional account linking the Great Fire of Rome, the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire and Emperor Nero, the film - following the novel &quot;Quo vadis&quot; by the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz - featured also a mighty protagonist named Ursus (Italian filmmakers later made several pepla in the 1960s exploiting the Ursus character). MGM also planned &quot;Ben Hur&quot; to be filmed in Italy as early as 1952.

Riccardo Freda&#x27;s &quot;Sins of Rome&quot; was filmed in 1953 and released by RKO in an edited, English-dubbed version the following year. Unlike &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, there were no American actors or production crew. The Anthony Quinn film &quot;Attila&quot; (directed by Pietro Francisci in 1954), the Kirk Douglas epic &quot;Ulysses&quot; (co-directed by an uncredited Mario Bava in 1954) and &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (directed by Robert Wise with Sergio Leone as an uncredited second unit director in 1955) were the first of the big peplum films of the 1950s. Riccardo Freda directed another peplum, &quot;Theodora, Slave Empress&quot; in 1954, starring his wife Gianna Maria Canale. Howard Hawks directed his &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot; (starring Joan Collins) in Italy and Egypt in 1955. Robert Rossen made his film &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; in Egypt in 1956, with a music score by famed Italian composer Mario Nascimbene.

==The main sword-and-sandal period (1958-1965)==
To cash in on the success of the Kirk Douglas film &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Pietro Francisci planned to make a film about Hercules, but searched unsuccessfully for years for a physically convincing yet experienced actor. His daughter spotted American bodybuilder Steve Reeves in the American film &quot;Athena&quot; and he was hired to play Hercules in 1957 when the film was made. (Reeves was paid $10,000 to star in the film).

The genre&#x27;s instantaneous growth began with the U.S. theatrical release of &quot;Hercules&quot; in 1959. American producer Joseph E. Levine acquired the U.S. distribution rights for $120,000, spent $1 million promoting the film and made more than $5 million profit. This spawned the 1959 Steve Reeves sequel &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot;, the 1959 re-release of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949), and dozens of imitations that followed in their wake. Italian filmmakers resurrected their 1920s Maciste character in a brand new 1960s sound film series (1960–1964), followed rapidly by Ursus, Samson, Goliath and various other mighty-muscled heroes.

Almost all peplum films of this period featured bodybuilder stars, the most popular being Steve Reeves, Reg Park and Gordon Scott. Some of these stars, such as Mickey Hargitay, Reg Lewis, Mark Forest, Gordon Mitchell and Dan Vadis, had starred in Mae West&#x27;s touring stage review in the United States in the 1950s. Bodybuilders of Italian origin, on the other hand, would adopt English pseudonyms for the screen; thus, stuntman Sergio Ciani became Alan Steel, and ex-gondolier Adriano Bellini was called Kirk Morris.
To be sure, many of the films enjoyed widespread popularity among general audiences, and had production values that were typical for popular films of their day. Some films included frequent re-use of the impressive film sets that had been created for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.

Although many of the bigger budget pepla were released theatrically in the US, fourteen of them were released directly to Embassy Pictures television in a syndicated TV package called &quot;The Sons of Hercules&quot;. Since few American viewers had a familiarity with Italian film heroes such as Maciste or Ursus, the characters were renamed and the films molded into a series of sorts by splicing on the same opening and closing theme song and newly designed voice-over narration that attempted to link the protagonist of each film to the Hercules mythos. These films ran on Saturday afternoons in the 1960s.

Peplum films were, and still are, often ridiculed for their low budgets and bad English dubbing. The contrived plots, poorly overdubbed dialogue, novice acting skills of the bodybuilder leads, and primitive special effects that were often inadequate to depict the mythological creatures on screen all conspire to give these films a certain camp appeal now. In the 1990s, several of them have been subjects of riffing and satire in the United States comedy series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

However, in the early 1960s, a group of French critics, mostly writing for the &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, such as Luc Moullet, started to celebrate the genre and some of its directors, including Vittorio Cottafavi, Riccardo Freda, Mario Bava, Pietro Francisci, Duccio Tessari, and Sergio Leone. Not only directors, but also some of the screenwriters, often put together in teams, worked past the typically formulaic plot structure to include a mixture of &quot;bits of philosophical readings and scraps of psychoanalysis, reflections on the biggest political systems, the fate of the world and humanity, fatalistic notions of accepting the will of destiny and the gods, anthropocentric belief in the powers of the human physique, and brilliant syntheses of military treatises&quot;.

With reference to the genre&#x27;s free use of ancient mythology and other influences, Italian director Vittorio Cottafavi, who directed a number of peplum films, used the term &quot;neo-mythologism&quot;.

===Hercules series (1958–1965)===

A series of 19 Hercules movies were made in Italy in the late &#x27;50s and early &#x27;60s. The films were all sequels to the successful Steve Reeves peplum &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958), but with the exception of &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot;, each film was a stand-alone story not connected to the others. The actors who played Hercules in these films were Steve Reeves followed by Gordon Scott, Kirk Morris, Mickey Hargitay, Mark Forest, Alan Steel, Dan Vadis, Brad Harris, Reg Park, Peter Lupus (billed as Rock Stevens) and Mike Lane. In a 1997 interview, Reeves said he felt his two Hercules films could not be topped by another sequel, so he declined to do any more Hercules films.

The films are listed below by their American release titles, and the titles in parentheses are their original Italian titles with an approximate English translation. Dates shown are the original Italian theatrical release dates, not the U.S. release dates (which were years later in some cases).
* &quot;Hercules&quot; (&quot;Le fatiche di Ercole&quot; / &quot;The Labors of Hercules&quot;, 1958) starring Steve Reeves

* &quot;Goliath and the Dragon&quot; (&quot;La vendetta di Ercole&quot; / &quot;The Revenge of Hercules&quot;, 1960) starring Mark Forest as Hercules (Hercules&#x27; name was changed to &quot;Goliath&quot; when this film was dubbed in English and distributed in the U.S.)

* &quot;The Fury of Hercules&quot; (&quot;La furia di Ercole&quot; / &quot;The Fury of Hercules&quot;) starring Brad Harris as Hercules, 1962 (alternate U.S. title: &quot;The Fury of Samson&quot;)
* &quot;Hercules, Samson and Ulysses&quot; (&quot;Ercole sfida Sansone&quot; / &quot;Hercules Challenges Samson&quot;) starring Kirk Morris as Hercules, 1963
* &quot;Hercules Against Moloch&quot; (&quot;Ercole contro Molock&quot; / &quot;Hercules vs. Molock&quot;) starring Gordon Scott as Hercules, 1963 ( &quot;The Conquest of Mycenae&quot;)
* &quot;Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness&quot; (&quot;Ercole l&#x27;invincibile&quot; / &quot;Hercules the Invincible&quot;) starring Dan Vadis as Hercules, 1964. (this was originally a Hercules film that was re-titled for inclusion in the U.S. syndicated TV package &quot;The Sons of Hercules&quot;).
* &quot;Hercules vs The Giant Warriors&quot; (&quot;il trionfo di Ercole&quot; / &quot;The Triumph of Hercules&quot;) starring Dan Vadis as Hercules, 1964 (alternate U.S. title: &quot;Hercules and the Ten Avengers&quot;)
* &quot;Hercules Against Rome&quot; (&quot;Ercole contro Roma&quot; / &quot;Hercules vs. Rome&quot;) starring Alan Steel as Hercules, 1964
* &quot;Hercules Against the Sons of the Sun&quot; (&quot;Ercole contro i figli del sole&quot; / &quot;Hercules vs. the Sons of the Sun&quot;) starring Mark Forest as Hercules, 1964
* &quot;Samson and His Mighty Challenge&quot; (&quot;Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili&quot; / &quot;Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles&quot;) starring Alan Steel as Hercules, 1964 ( &quot;Combate dei Gigantes&quot; or &quot;Le Grand Defi&quot;)
* &quot;Hercules and the Tyrants of Babylon&quot; (&quot;Ercole contro i tiranni di Babilonia&quot; / &quot;Hercules vs. the Tyrants of Babylon&quot;) starring Rock Stevens as Hercules, 1964
* &quot;Hercules and the Princess of Troy&quot; (no Italian title) starring Gordon Scott as Hercules, 1965 ( &quot;Hercules vs. the Sea Monster&quot;; this U.S./ Italian co-production was made as a pilot for a Charles Band-produced TV series that never materialized and it was later distributed as a feature film)
* &quot;Hercules the Avenger&quot; (&quot;Sfida dei giganti&quot; / &quot;Challenge of the Giants&quot;) starring Reg Park as Hercules, 1965 (this film was composed mostly of re-edited footage from the two 1961 Reg Park Hercules films)

A number of English-dubbed Italian films that featured the word &quot;Hercules&quot; in the title were not made as Hercules movies originally, such as:
* &quot;Hercules Against the Moon Men&quot;, &quot;Hercules Against the Barbarians&quot;, &quot;Hercules Against the Mongols&quot; and &quot;Hercules of the Desert&quot; were all originally Maciste films. (See &quot;Maciste&quot; section below)
* &quot;Hercules and the Black Pirate&quot; and &quot;Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas&quot; were both re-titled Samson movies. (See &quot;Samson&quot; section below)
* &quot;Hercules, Prisoner of Evil&quot; was actually a re-titled Ursus film. (See &quot;Ursus&quot; section below)
* &quot;Hercules and the Masked Rider&quot; was actually a re-titled Goliath movie. (See &quot;Goliath&quot; section below)
None of these films in their original Italian versions involved the Hercules character in any way. Likewise, most of the &quot;Sons of Hercules&quot; movies shown on American TV in the 1960s had nothing to do with Hercules in their original Italian versions.

(see also &quot;The Three Stooges Meet Hercules&quot; (1962), an American-made genre parody starring peplum star Samson Burke as Hercules)

===Goliath series (1959–1964)===
The Italians used Goliath as the superhero protagonist in a series of adventure films (pepla) in the early 1960s. He was a man possessed of amazing strength, although he seemed to be a different person in each film. After the classic &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, a 1959 Steve Reeves film &quot;Il terrore dei barbari&quot; (&quot;Terror of the Barbarians&quot;) was re-titled &quot;Goliath and the Barbarians&quot; in the U.S. The film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a generic beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not related to each other in any way (the 1960 Italian peplum &quot;David and Goliath&quot; starring Orson Welles was not part of this series, since that movie was just a historical retelling of the Biblical story).

The titles in the Italian &quot;Goliath&quot; adventure series were as follows: (the first title listed for each film is the film&#x27;s original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses)
* &quot;Il terrore dei barbari&quot; / &quot;Terror of the Barbarians&quot; (1959) (Goliath and the Barbarians in the U.S.), starring Steve Reeves as Goliath (although he is referred to as &quot;Emiliano&quot; in the original Italian-language version)
* &quot;Goliath contro i giganti&quot; / &quot;Goliath Against the Giants&quot; (Goliath Against the Giants) (1960) starring Brad Harris
* &quot;Goliath e la schiava ribelle&quot; / &quot;Goliath and the Rebel Slave&quot; (Tyrant of Lydia Against The Son of Hercules) (1963) starring Gordon Scott
* &quot;Golia e il cavaliere mascherato&quot; / &quot;Goliath and the Masked Rider&quot; (Hercules and the Masked Rider) (1964) starring Alan Steel (note: Goliath is referred to as &quot;Hercules&quot; in English-dubbed prints)
* &quot;Golia alla conquista di Bagdad&quot; / &quot;Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad&quot; (Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus, 1964) starring Rock Stevens (aka Peter Lupus)

The name Goliath was also inserted into the English titles of three other Italian pepla that were re-titled for U.S. distribution in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as &quot;Goliath movies&quot; in Italy.

Both &quot;Goliath and the Vampires&quot; (1961) and &quot;Goliath and the Sins of Babylon&quot; (1963) actually featured the famed Italian folk hero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name &quot;Maciste&quot; meant anything to American audiences.

&quot;Goliath and the Dragon&quot; (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules movie called &quot;The Revenge of Hercules&quot;, but it was re-titled &quot;Goliath and the Dragon&quot; in the U.S. since at the time &quot;Goliath and the Barbarians&quot; was breaking box-office records, and the distributors may have thought the name &quot;Hercules&quot; was trademarked by distributor Joseph E. Levine.

===Maciste series (1960–1965)===

There were a total of 25 Maciste films from the 1960s peplum craze (not counting the two dozen silent Maciste films made in Italy pre-1930). By 1960, seeing how well the two Steve Reeves &quot;Hercules&quot; films were doing at the box office, Italian producers decided to revive the 1920s silent film character &quot;Maciste&quot; in a new series of color/sound films. Unlike the other Italian peplum protagonists, Maciste found himself in a variety of time periods ranging from the Ice Age to 16th century Scotland. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. However, in the first film of the 1960s series, he mentions to another character that the name &quot;Maciste&quot; means &quot;born of the rock&quot; (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth itself in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually titled &quot;The Giant from the Dolomite&quot;, hinting that Maciste may be more god than man, which would explain his great strength.
The first title listed for each film is the film&#x27;s original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses (note how many times Maciste&#x27;s name in the Italian title is altered to an entirely different name in the American title):

* &quot;Maciste il Vendicatore dei Mayas&quot; / &quot;Maciste, Avenger of the Mayans&quot; (has no American title, 1965) (Note:* this Maciste film was made up almost entirely of re-edited stock footage from two older Maciste films, &quot;Maciste contro i mostri&quot; and &quot;Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste&quot;, so Maciste switches from Kirk Morris to Reg Lewis in various scenes; this movie is very scarce since it was never distributed in the U.S. and is apparently not even available in English)

In 1973, the Spanish cult film director Jesus Franco directed two low-budget &quot;Maciste films&quot; for French producers: &quot;Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones&quot; (&quot;Maciste vs the Queen of the Amazons&quot;) and &quot;Les exploits érotiques de Maciste dans l&#x27;Atlantide&quot; (&quot;The Erotic Exploits of Maciste in Atlantis&quot;). The films had almost identical casts, both starring Val Davis as Maciste, and appear to have been shot back-to-back. The former was distributed in Italy as a &quot;Karzan&quot; movie (a cheap Tarzan imitation), while the latter film was released only in France with hardcore inserts as &quot;Les Gloutonnes&quot; (&quot;The Gobblers&quot;). These two films were totally unrelated to the 1960s Italian Maciste series.

===Ursus series (1960–1964)===

Following Buddy Baer&#x27;s portrayal of Ursus in the classic 1951 film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, Ursus was used as a superhuman Roman-era character who became the protagonist in a series of Italian adventure films made in the early 1960s.

When the &quot;Hercules&quot; film craze hit in 1959, Italian filmmakers were looking for other muscleman characters similar to Hercules whom they could exploit, resulting in the nine-film Ursus series listed below. Ursus was referred to as a &quot;Son of Hercules&quot; in two of the films when they were dubbed in English (in an attempt to cash in on the then-popular &quot;Hercules&quot; craze), although in the original Italian films, Ursus had no connection to Hercules whatsoever. In the English-dubbed version of one Ursus film (retitled &quot;Hercules, Prisoner of Evil&quot;), Ursus was actually referred to throughout the entire film as &quot;Hercules&quot;.

There were a total of nine Italian films that featured Ursus as the main character, listed below as follows: Italian title / English translation of the Italian title (American release title);
* &quot;Ursus&quot; / &quot;Ursus&quot; (Ursus, Son of Hercules, 1960) &quot;Mighty Ursus&quot; (United Kingdom), starring Ed Fury
* &quot;La Vendetta di Ursus&quot; / &quot;The Revenge of Ursus&quot; (The Vengeance of Ursus, 1961) starring Samson Burke
* &quot;Ursus e la Ragazza Tartara&quot; / &quot;Ursus and the Tartar Girl&quot; (Ursus and the Tartar Princess, 1961) &quot;The Tartar Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Tartar Girl&quot;; starring Joe Robinson, Akim Tamiroff, Yoko Tani; directed by Remigio Del Grosso
* &quot;Ursus Nella Valle dei Leoni&quot; / &quot;Ursus in the Valley of the Lions&quot; (Valley of the Lions, 1962) starring Ed Fury; this film revealed the origin story of Ursus
* &quot;Ursus il gladiatore ribelle&quot; / &quot;Ursus the Rebel Gladiator&quot; (The Rebel Gladiators, 1962) starring Dan Vadis
* &quot;Ursus Nella Terra di Fuoco&quot; / &quot;Ursus in the Land of Fire&quot; (Son of Hercules in the Land of Fire, 1963) &quot;Son of Atlas in the Land of Fire&quot;; starring Ed Fury
* &quot;Ursus il terrore dei Kirghisi&quot; / &quot;Ursus, the Terror of the Kirghiz&quot; (Hercules, Prisoner of Evil, 1964) starring Reg Park
* &quot;Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili&quot; / &quot;Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles&quot; (Samson and His Mighty Challenge, 1964) starring Yan Larvor as Ursus ( &quot;Combate dei Gigantes&quot; or &quot;Le Grand Defi&quot;)
* &quot;Gli Invincibili Tre&quot; / &quot;The Invincible Three&quot; (Three Avengers, 1964) starring Alan Steel as Ursus

===Samson series (1961–1964)===
A character named Samson was featured in a series of five Italian peplum films in the 1960s, no doubt inspired by the 1959 re-release of the epic Victor Mature film &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. The character was similar to the Biblical Samson in the third and fifth films only; in the other three, he just appears to be a very strong man (not related at all to the Biblical figure).

The titles are listed as follows: Italian title / its English translation (U.S. release title in parentheses);
* &quot;Sansone&quot; / &quot;Samson (1961 Italian film)&quot; (Samson) 1961, starring Brad Harris
* &quot;Sansone contro i pirati&quot; / &quot;Samson Against the Pirates&quot; (Samson and the Sea Beast) 1963, starring Kirk Morris
* &quot;Ercole sfida Sansone&quot; / &quot;Hercules challenges Samson&quot; (Hercules, Samson and Ulysses) 1963, starring Richard Lloyd
* &quot;Sansone contro il corsaro nero&quot; / &quot;Samson Against the Black Pirate&quot; (Hercules and the Black Pirate) 1963, starring Alan Steel
* &quot;Ercole, Sansone, Maciste e Ursus: gli invincibili&quot; / &quot;Hercules, Samson, Maciste and Ursus: The Invincibles&quot; (Samson and the Mighty Challenge) 1964, starring Nadir Baltimore as Samson ( &quot;Samson and His Mighty Challenge&quot;, &quot;Combate dei Gigantes&quot; or &quot;Le Grand Défi&quot;)

The name Samson was also inserted into the U.S. titles of six other Italian movies when they were dubbed in English for U.S. distribution, although these films actually featured the adventures of the famed Italian folk hero Maciste.

&quot;Samson Against the Sheik&quot; (1962), &quot;Son of Samson&quot; (1960), &quot;Samson and the Slave Queen&quot; (1963), &quot;Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World&quot; (1961), &quot;Samson vs. the Giant King&quot; (1964), and &quot;Samson in King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1964) were all re-titled Maciste movies, because the American distributors did not feel the name Maciste was marketable to U.S. filmgoers.

&quot;Samson and the Treasure of the Incas&quot; ( &quot;Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas&quot;) (1965) sounds like a peplum title, but was actually a spaghetti Western.

===&quot;The Sons of Hercules&quot; (TV syndication package)===

&quot;The Sons of Hercules&quot; was a syndicated television show that aired in the United States in the 1960s. The series repackaged 14 randomly chosen Italian peplum films by unifying them with memorable title and end title theme songs and a standard voice-over intro relating the main hero in each film to Hercules any way they could. In some regions, each film was split into two one-hour episodes, so the 14 films were shown as 28 weekly episodes. None of the films were ever theatrically released in the U.S.

The films are not listed in chronological order, since they were not really related to each other in any way. The first title listed below for each film was its American broadcast television title, followed in parentheses by the English translation of its original Italian theatrical title:
* &quot;Ursus, Son of Hercules&quot; (&quot;Ursus&quot;) 1961, starring Ed Fury, &quot;Mighty Ursus&quot; in England

* &quot;Fire Monsters Against the Son of Hercules&quot; (&quot;Maciste vs. the Monsters&quot;) 1962, starring Reg Lewis
* &quot;Venus Against the Son of Hercules&quot; (&quot;Mars, God Of War&quot;) 1962, starring Roger Browne
* &quot;Ulysses Against the Son of Hercules&quot; (&quot;Ulysses against Hercules&quot;) 1962, starring Mike Lane
* &quot;Medusa Against the Son of Hercules&quot; (&quot;Perseus The Invincible&quot;) 1962, starring Richard Harrison

* &quot;Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness&quot; (&quot;Hercules the Invincible&quot;) 1964, starring Dan Vadis
* &quot;Devil of the Desert Against the Son of Hercules&quot; (&quot;Anthar the Invincible&quot;) 1964, starring Kirk Morris, directed by Antonio Margheriti, &quot;The Slave Merchants&quot;, &quot;Soraya, Queen of the Desert&quot;

===Steve Reeves pepla (in chronological order of production)===

Steve Reeves appeared in 14 pepla made in Italy from 1958 to 1964, and most of his films are highly regarded examples of the genre.

==Other (non-series) Italian pepla==
There were many 1950s and 1960s Italian pepla that did not feature a major superhero (such as Hercules, Maciste or Samson), and as such they fall into a sort of miscellaneous category. Many were of the &quot;Cappa e spada&quot; (swashbuckler) variety, though they often feature well-known characters such as Ali Baba, Julius Caesar, Ulysses, Cleopatra, the Three Musketeers, Zorro, Theseus, Perseus, Achilles, Robin Hood, and Sandokan. The first really successful Italian films of this kind were &quot;Black Eagle&quot; (1946) and &quot;Fabiola&quot; (1949).

==The second peplum wave: the 1980s==
After the peplum gave way to the spaghetti Western and Eurospy films in 1965, the genre lay dormant for close to 20 years. Then in 1982, the box-office successes of Jean-Jacques Annaud&#x27;s &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (1981), Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982) and &quot;Clash of the Titans (1981 film)&quot; (1981) spurred a second renaissance of sword and sorcery Italian pepla in the five years immediately following. Most of these films had low budgets, focusing more on barbarians and pirates so as to avoid the need for expensive Greco-Roman sets. The filmmakers tried to compensate for their shortcomings with the addition of some graphic gore and nudity. Many of these 1980s entries were helmed by noted Italian horror film directors (Joe D&#x27;Amato, Lucio Fulci, Luigi Cozzi, etc.) and many featured actors Lou Ferrigno, Miles O&#x27;Keeffe and Sabrina Siani. Here is a list of the 1980s pepla:
* &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (1983) &quot;Adamo ed Eva, la prima storia d&#x27;amore&quot;, contains stock footage from &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Ator, the Fighting Eagle&quot; (1983) &quot;Ator the Invincible&quot;, starring Miles O&#x27;Keeffe and Sabrina Siani, directed by Joe D&#x27;Amato
* &quot;Ator 2: The Blade Master&quot; (1985) &quot;Cave Dwellers&quot;, starring Miles O&#x27;Keefe, directed by Joe D&#x27;Amato
* &quot;Ator 3: Iron Warrior&quot; (1986) &quot;Iron Warrior&quot;, starring Miles O&#x27;Keeffe, directed by Alfonso Brescia (Joe D&#x27;Amato disowned this entry in the &quot;Ator&quot; saga, since it was done without his involvement)
* &quot;Ator 4: Quest for the Mighty Sword&quot; (1989) &quot;Quest for the Mighty Sword&quot;, starring Eric Allan Kramer (as the son of Ator), Laura Gemser and Marisa Mell, directed by Joe D&#x27;Amato
* &quot;Barbarian Master&quot; (1984) &quot;Sangraal, the Sword of Fire&quot;, &quot;Sword of the Barbarians&quot;, starring Sabrina Siani

* &quot;Ironmaster&quot; (1983) &quot;The War of Iron&quot;, co-starring Luigi Montefiori, directed by Umberto Lenzi
* &quot;The Seven Magnificent Gladiators&quot; (1983) starring Lou Ferrigno and Dan Vadis
* &quot;She&quot; (1982) starring Sandahl Bergman and Gordon Mitchell

* &quot;Yor, the Hunter from the Future&quot; (1983) starring Reb Brown, directed by Antonio Margheriti (a barbarian film that has science fiction elements in the story)

A group of so-called &quot;porno peplum&quot; films were devoted to Roman emperors, especially - but not only - to Caligula and Claudius&#x27; spouse Messalina:
* &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979) directed by Tinto Brass

<text>Witness Lee (; September 5, 1905 – June 9, 1997) was a Chinese Christian preacher and hymnist belonging to the Christian group known as the local churches (or Local Church) in Taiwan and the United States. He was also the founder of Living Stream Ministry. Lee was born in 1905 in the city of Yantai, Shandong, China, to a Southern Baptist family. He became a Christian in 1925 after hearing the preaching of an evangelist named Peace Wang and later joined the Christian work started by Watchman Nee. Like Nee, Lee emphasized what he considered the believers&#x27; subjective experience and enjoyment of Christ as life for the building up of the church, not as an organization, but as the Body of Christ.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Witness Lee was born in 1905 in Shandong Province in China. Lee&#x27;s great-grandfather was a Southern Baptist who brought Lee&#x27;s mother into Christianity. Lee&#x27;s mother studied in an American Southern Baptist mission school and was baptized as a teenager at a Southern Baptist church. She sold her inheritance to provide her children with an education in Chinese and English. Lee&#x27;s father was a farmer who died in 1923.

Lee was brought into contact with his mother&#x27;s Baptist Church in Yantai where he studied at a Southern Baptist elementary school and later at a mission college operated by American Presbyterians. Although Lee attended Southern Baptist services and Sunday school in his youth, he was never converted nor baptized by them. After her conversion, Lee&#x27;s second sister began to pray for him and introduced him to a Chinese pastor who encouraged him to attend his Sunday morning services. Inspired by the preaching of Peace Wang, Lee dedicated himself to serve God for the rest of his life in April 1925 at the age of 19.

Through Watchman Nee&#x27;s teaching Lee began to believe that denominationalism was unscriptural. In 1927, when elected to the board of the Chinese Independent Church, he declined the position and left the denomination. Lee then began to meet with the Benjamin Newton branch of the Plymouth Brethren where he remained for seven and a half years and was baptized in the sea by a local Brethren leader, Mr. Burnett, in 1930.

===Ministry with Watchman Nee===

Soon after Lee&#x27;s conversion to Christianity, he began to study various Christian teachers and discovered the writings of Watchman Nee in two periodicals, &quot;The Morning Star&quot; and &quot;The Christian&quot;. Lee began to correspond with Nee to seek his guidance for a better understanding of the Bible. In 1932 Nee visited Yantai, and the two met for the first time. During the visit, Lee felt that his relationship with God and his understanding of how to study the Bible were revolutionized.

During this time, Lee began to feel that God was calling him to quit his job and serve as a full-time minister, which he did in August 1933. Soon afterward, he received a letter from Watchman Nee that read, “Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.” Lee felt this letter strongly confirmed his decision. From that point onward, Lee began to work closely with Nee.

In 1934, Lee moved his family to Shanghai as editor of Nee&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Christian&quot;. The following year, he began to travel throughout China giving messages to Christians and helping to establish local churches; many churches were established in Zhejiang Province as well as in Beijing and Tianjin. He also traveled to the northwestern provinces of Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi to preach the gospel and edify Christians there prior to the Japanese invasion in 1937.

With the war beginning, Lee returned to Yantai caring for churches in Yantai and Qingdao. At the end of 1942 a revival broke out in Yantai, and the church met continuously for one hundred days. Under suspicion of espionage due to his experimentation with evangelism by migration, Lee was arrested by the Imperial Japanese Army in May 1943 and underwent a month&#x27;s interrogation through flogging and water torture. His health was greatly weakened by this imprisonment and he developed tuberculosis. In order to rest and recuperate, he moved to Qingdao in 1944 for two years. Following the end of the war, brought great uncertainty for Nee&#x27;s ministry. In 1949, Nee and his co-workers sent Witness Lee to Taiwan in order to continue Nee&#x27;s work free from the threat of government persecution under Chinese communism.

Watchman Nee and Witness Lee met for the last time in Hong Kong in 1950. For over a month they spoke together and helped bring about a revival in the church in Hong Kong. Nee charged Lee to instruct, teach, and lead the elders and to make arrangements concerning the church services, as well as the purchase of land for the building of a new meeting place. Nee then returned to mainland China where, in 1952, he was imprisoned for the remaining twenty years of his life by the CCP. The two were never able to communicate again.

===Ministry in Taiwan===

When Witness Lee moved to Taiwan in May 1949 he began his work with a few believers and churches already present there. Within five to six years, the number of Christians under his leadership increased from five hundred to over fifty thousand. Lee began to conduct conferences and trainings for the churches on a yearly basis and beginning in 1951 a formal training for his ministry co-workers. Lee also began to publish books through his publishing company, The Taiwan Gospel Book Room, as well as &quot;The Ministry of the Word&quot; magazine published from 1950 until 1986 in 415 issues.

===Going west===

Lee&#x27;s work in the West was initiated with invitations to conduct conferences in London, England and Copenhagen, Denmark in 1958. Between 1958 and 1961, he also visited the United States three times. In 1962 he moved to Los Angeles and held his first conference there. Messages from that conference were later published as a book entitled &quot;The All-Inclusive Christ&quot;. In the ensuing years, Lee was invited to speak to Christian groups throughout the United States. His messages delivered during shorter conferences and longer trainings were printed in &quot;The Stream&quot; magazine, published by The Stream Publishers (later renamed Living Stream Ministry).

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Lee traveled extensively throughout the United States, Canada, and the Far East, and elsewhere. In 1974 he moved to Anaheim, California where he began a book-by-book exposition of the Bible with the &quot;Life-study of Genesis&quot;. His entire &quot;Life-study of the Bible&quot; was completed in December 1994. Lee also wrote extensive outlines, footnotes, and cross references for the entire New Testament; these were eventually incorporated into a new translation of the New Testament, the Recovery Version, published in English in 1985. A translation into Chinese appeared in 1987, with various other languages following it since Lee&#x27;s death.

===&quot;God-Ordained Way&quot;===

Beginning in the mid-1980s, Witness Lee felt that the rate of growth was too slow in the local churches. Eventually, he returned to Taiwan and determined that there was a need for a shift away from large meetings with one speaker to small group meetings in homes. In his ministry he began to refer to this emphasis as the &quot;God-ordained way.&quot; Lee believed that by practicing the God-ordained way, churches could be saved from oldness and degradation and be brought back to a biblical pattern. The God-ordained way consists of four major steps:

===Later ministry===

In February 1994 Lee began to deliver messages on subjects he referred to as &quot;the high peak of the divine revelation.&quot; The focus of his messages was &quot;God’s economy to make the believers God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.&quot; He also spoke on topics like &quot;the New Jerusalem, the complete salvation of God with its judicial and organic aspects, the full ministry of Christ in His three divine and mystical stages, and the incorporation of the believers with the consummated Triune God.&quot; He also began a series of Bible expositions known as &quot;Crystallization-studies.&quot; He continued to encourage the practice of the &quot;God-ordained way.&quot;

Witness Lee gave his last conference in February 1997. Three months later he was hospitalized with complications due to prostate cancer. He died on June 9, 1997.

==Witness Lee&#x27;s view of Christendom==

Witness Lee was critical of Christendom as a system while stressing the need to accept all believers based on what he taught was the common faith (Tit. 1:4, Jude 3).

Witness Lee taught that certain practices in Christendom were unscriptural, such as the use of denominating names and the clergy-laity system. Nevertheless, he often emphasized the need for oneness among all Christians.

==Publications==
Many of Witness Lee&#x27;s spoken messages have been published in over 400 books translated into more than fourteen different languages. His largest written work is &quot;The Life-study of the Bible&quot;, comprising over 25,000 pages of commentary on every book of the Bible from the perspective of the believers&#x27; enjoyment and experience of God&#x27;s divine life in Christ through the Holy Spirit. A radio broadcast called &quot;Life-study of the Bible with Witness Lee&quot; was later produced from these spoken messages. Following the &quot;Life-study&quot; Lee began a focused &quot;Crystallization-study&quot; to look at high points, or &quot;crystals,&quot; of each book of the Bible. However, he died before completing this work.

He was also the chief editor of a new translation of the New Testament into English and Chinese called the Recovery Version.

In addition, Witness Lee wrote, collected, and translated Christian hymns. In 1963 and 1964, he wrote the lyrics to approximately 200 new hymns that he compiled together with hymns from other authors. These were then categorized by topic for &quot;Hymns&quot;, with a total of 1,080 songs, published by Living Stream Ministry.

<doc id="253661" wikidata="Q108195999" url="?curid=253661" title="Edition (printmaking)">
<text>In printmaking, an edition is a number of prints struck from one plate, usually at the same time. This may be a &quot;limited edition&quot;, with a fixed number of impressions produced on the understanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an &quot;open edition&quot; limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the plate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed by the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of that impression and the total edition size.

== Original or reproduction? ==
An important and often confused distinction is that between editions of original prints, produced in the same medium as the artist worked (e.g., etching, or lithography), and reproduction prints (or paintings), which are photographic reproductions of the original work, essentially in the same category as a picture in a book or magazine, though better printed and on better paper. These may be marketed as &quot;limited editions&quot; with investment potential (which is rarely realized), and even signed and numbered by the artist. Some knowledge is often required to tell the difference.

== Development of the concept ==
One of the main reasons for the development of printmaking was the desire of artists to make more money from their work by selling multiple copies; printmaking satisfies this motive. The production of multiple copies also tends to reduce production costs and market price when compared to a single or unique image. Until the 19th century, in the period of the Old master print the concept of an edition did not really apply to prints, unlike books. Prints were often run off as demand allowed, and often worn-out plates were reworked by the original artist or another, to produce a new state. The art market attempts to distinguish between &quot;lifetime impressions&quot; and &quot;late impressions&quot;, which were produced after the death of the artist. This can be done to some extent by the study of the paper involved, and its watermark, and the condition of the plate as revealed by the printed image. But it remains a difficult area. 

The aquatints of Goya, which are done in a technique that wears out quickly on the plate, were the first important prints to be published initially in limited editions, which however were not signed or numbered. In fact the plates survived, and since Goya&#x27;s death several further editions have been published, showing a progressive and drastic decline in quality of the image, despite some rework. Because of this and other cases, &quot;posthumous editions&quot; produced after the death of an artist, and obviously not signed by him, are usually far less sought after. The plates of later prints are often &quot;cancelled&quot; by defacing the image, with a couple of impressions of the cancelled plate taken to document it. This is now expected by collectors and investors, who want the prints they buy to retain their value.

== Modern practice ==
Prints by artists today may potentially retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) because they are created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce because the number of multiples is limited. In Rembrandt&#x27;s time, the limit on the size of an edition was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.

Today, artists will sometimes refer to a print as a &quot;one-off,&quot; meaning that the artist has made a unique print and no reproductions of it from the original matrix, often not even a proof. In this category one sometimes finds monotypes, monoprints, collagraphs, altered prints with collage or chine colle additions, or even hand-colored prints. There remain artists who are strong advocates of &quot;artist&#x27;s prints&quot; which are conceived, printed, signed, and given the edition number 1/1 by the artist.

== Numbering ==
Because of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.

In later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., &quot;15/30&quot; for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In monotyping, a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked &quot;unique&quot;. Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating intaglio images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal.

The conventions for numbering prints are well-established, a limited edition is normally hand signed and numbered by the artist, typically in pencil, in the form (e.g.): 14/100. The first number is the number of the print itself. The second number is the number of overall prints the artist will print of that image. The lower the second number is, the more valuable and collectible the limited editions are likely to be, within whatever their price range is. Other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. Artist&#x27;s proofs are marked &quot;A. P.&quot; or &quot;P/A&quot;, sometimes E. A. or E. d&#x27;A. (épreuve d&#x27;artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked &quot;unique&quot;; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked &quot;H. C.&quot; or &quot;H/C&quot;, meaning &quot;hors de commerce&quot;, not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist&#x27;s Proofs. The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked &quot;P. P.&quot; Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as &quot;bon à tirer&quot; or &quot;BAT&quot; (&quot;good to print&quot; in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.

Professional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several artist&#x27;s proof copies, including a &quot;bon a tirer&quot; print and then one unique copy designated as a &quot;one-off&quot; or &quot;1/1&quot; or &quot;one/off&quot;.

==Consumer protection laws==
In the United States limited editions are regulated under state consumer protections laws. California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the &quot;California Print Law&quot; of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the &quot;Georgia Print Law&quot;. That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states. The Georgia Print Law written by (former) State Representative Chesley V. Morton, became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law. The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.

<doc id="253662" wikidata="Q138846" url="?curid=253662" title="Andy Rooney">
<text>Andrew Aitken Rooney (January 14, 1919 – November 4, 2011) was an American radio and television writer who was best known for his weekly broadcast &quot;A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney&quot;, a part of the CBS News program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; from 1978 to 2011. His final regular appearance on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired on October 2, 2011; he died a month later at the age of 92.

==Early life and education==
Andrew Aitken Rooney was born in Albany, New York, the son of Walter Scott Rooney (1888–1959) and Ellinor (Reynolds) Rooney (1886–1980). He attended The Albany Academy, and later attended Colgate University in Hamilton in central New York, where he was initiated into the Sigma Chi fraternity, before he was drafted into the United States Army in August 1941.

== World War II ==
Rooney began his career in newspapers in 1942 while in the Army where he began writing for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; in London. He was one of six correspondents who flew on the second American bombing raid over Germany in February 1943, flying with the Eighth Air Force. He was the first journalist to reach the Ludendorff Bridge after the 9th Armored Division captured it on March 7, 1945. He was to the west when he heard that the bridge had been captured. &quot;It was a reporter&#x27;s dream,&quot; he wrote. &quot;One of the great stories of the war had fallen into my lap.&quot; The bridge capture was front-page news in America. Rooney rated the capture of the bridge as one of the top five events of the entire European war, alongside D-Day.

He was one of the first American journalists to visit the Nazi concentration camps near the end of World War II, and one of the first to write about them. During a segment on Tom Brokaw&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, Rooney stated that he had been opposed to World War II because he was a pacifist. He recounted that what he saw in those concentration camps made him ashamed that he had opposed the war and permanently changed his opinions about whether &quot;just wars&quot; exist.

Rooney was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal and Air Medal for his service as a war correspondent in combat zones during the war. His 1995 memoir &quot;My War&quot; chronicles his war reporting and recounts several notable historical events and people from a first-hand view, including the entry into Paris and the Nazi concentration camps. He describes how it shaped his experience both as a writer and reporter.

==Career==
Rooney joined CBS in 1949 as a writer for &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, when Godfrey was at his peak on CBS radio and TV. It opened the show up to a variety of viewers. The program was a hit, reaching number one in 1952 during Rooney&#x27;s tenure. It was the beginning of a close lifelong friendship between Rooney and Godfrey. He wrote for Godfrey&#x27;s daytime radio and TV show &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot;. He later moved on to &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; which became a hit program. During the same period, he wrote public affairs programs for CBS News, such as &quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;.

Rooney wrote his first television essay in 1964 called &quot;An Essay on Doors&quot;, &quot;a longer-length precursor of the type&quot; that he did on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, according to CBS News&#x27;s biography of him. From 1962 to 1968, he collaborated with CBS News correspondent Harry Reasoner, Rooney writing and producing and Reasoner narrating. They wrote on CBS News specials such as &quot;An Essay on Bridges&quot; (1965), &quot;An Essay on Hotels&quot; (1966), &quot;An Essay on Women&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Strange Case of the English Language&quot; (1968). In 1968, he wrote two episodes of the CBS News documentary series &quot;Of Black America&quot;, and his script for &quot;Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed&quot; won him his first Emmy.

CBS refused to broadcast his World War II memoir titled &quot;An Essay on War&quot; in 1970, so Rooney quit CBS and read the opinion himself on PBS, which was his first appearance on television. That show in 1971 won him his third Writers Guild Award. He rejoined CBS in 1973 to write and produce special programs. He also wrote the script for the 1975 documentary &quot;FDR: The Man Who Changed America&quot;.

After his return to the network, Rooney wrote and appeared in several primetime specials for CBS, including &quot;In Praise of New York City&quot; (1974), the Peabody Award-winning &quot;Mr. Rooney Goes to Washington&quot; (1975), &quot;Mr. Rooney Goes to Dinner&quot; (1978), and &quot;Mr. Rooney Goes to Work&quot; (1977). Transcripts of these specials are contained in the book &quot;A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney&quot;, as well as of some of the earlier collaborations with Reasoner.

==&quot;A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney&quot;==
Rooney&#x27;s &quot;end-of-show&quot; segment on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney&quot; (originally &quot;Three Minutes or So With Andy Rooney&quot;), began in 1978, as a summer replacement for the debate segment &quot;Point/Counterpoint&quot; featuring Shana Alexander and James Kilpatrick. The segment proved popular enough with viewers that beginning in the fall of 1978, it was seen in alternate weeks with the debate segment. At the end of the 1978–1979 season, &quot;Point/Counterpoint&quot; was dropped altogether.

In the segment, Rooney typically offered satire on a trivial everyday issue, such as the cost of groceries, annoying relatives, or faulty Christmas presents. Rooney&#x27;s appearances on &quot;A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney&quot; often included whimsical lists, such as types of milk, bottled water brands, car brands, and sports mascots. In later years, his segments became more political as well. Despite being best known for his television presence on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Rooney always considered himself a writer who incidentally appeared on television behind his famous walnut table, which he had made himself.

==Controversies==
Rooney made a number of comments which elicited strong reactions from fans and producers alike.

===Comments on race===
In February 1990, CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; suspended Rooney for three months in part because it was alleged that he had suggested that black people were less intelligent because they &quot;watered down their genes&quot;. After the program&#x27;s ratings dropped significantly, Rooney was let back on in March. Rooney vehemently disputed this in a 1999 interview, claiming he was instead referring to lower-income people more broadly.

Rooney wrote a column in 1992 that posited that it was &quot;silly&quot; for Native Americans to complain about team names like the Redskins, saying, in part, &quot;The real problem is, we took the country away from the Indians, they want it back and we&#x27;re not going to give it to them. We feel guilty and we&#x27;ll do what we can for them within reason, but they can&#x27;t have their country back. Next question.&quot; After receiving many letters from Native Americans, he wrote, &quot;when so many people complain about one thing, you have to assume you may have been wrong.&quot;

In a 2007 column for &quot;Tribune&quot; media services, he wrote, &quot;I know all about Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, but today&#x27;s baseball stars are all guys named Rodriguez to me.&quot; Rooney later commented, &quot;Yeah, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have said it, [but] it&#x27;s a name that seems common in baseball now. I certainly didn&#x27;t think of it in any derogatory sense.&quot;

===Comments on same-sex unions===
In 1990, Rooney was suspended without pay for three months by then-CBS News President David Burke, because of the negative publicity around his saying that &quot;too much alcohol, too much food, drugs, homosexual unions, cigarettes [are] all known to lead to premature death.&quot; He wrote an explanatory letter to a gay organization after being ordered not to do so. After only four weeks without Rooney, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; lost 20% of its audience. CBS management then decided that it was in the best interest of the network to have Rooney return immediately.

After Rooney&#x27;s reinstatement, he made his remorse public:

===Remarks on Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide===
In a 1994 segment, Rooney attracted controversy with his remarks on Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide. He expressed his dismay that the death of Richard Nixon was overshadowed by Cobain&#x27;s suicide, stating that he had never heard of Cobain or his band, Nirvana. He went on to say that Cobain&#x27;s suicide made him angry. &quot;A lot of people would like to have the years left that he threw away,&quot; Rooney said. &quot;What&#x27;s all this nonsense about how terrible life is?&quot; he asked, adding rhetorically to a young woman who had wept at the suicide, &quot;I&#x27;d love to relieve the pain you&#x27;re going through by switching my age for yours.&quot; In addition, he asked &quot;What would all these young people be doing if they had real problems like a Depression, World War II, or Vietnam?&quot; and commented, &quot;If [Cobain] applied the same brain to his music that he applied to his drug-infested life, it&#x27;s reasonable to think that his music may not have made much sense, either.&quot;

On the following Sunday&#x27;s show, he apologized on the air, saying he should have taken Cobain&#x27;s depression into account. He also read only critical feedback from listeners without interjecting any commentary of his own.

==Collections and retirement==
Rooney&#x27;s shorter television essays have been archived in numerous books, such as &quot;Common Nonsense&quot;, which came out in 2002, and &quot;Years of Minutes&quot;, probably his best-known work, released in 2003. He penned a regular syndicated column for Tribune Media Services that ran in many newspapers in the United States, and which has been collected in book form. He won three Emmy Awards for his essays, which numbered over 1,000. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Emmy in 2003. Rooney&#x27;s renown made him a frequent target of parodies and impersonations by a diverse group of comic figures, including Frank Caliendo, Rich Little and Beavis.

In 1993, CBS released a two-volume VHS tape set of the best of Rooney&#x27;s commentaries and field reports, called &quot;The Andy Rooney Television Collection — His Best Minutes.&quot; In 2006, CBS released three DVDs of his more recent commentaries, &quot;Andy Rooney On Almost Everything, Things That Bother Andy Rooney,&quot; and &quot;Andy Rooney&#x27;s Solutions&quot;.

Rooney&#x27;s final regular appearance on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; was on October 2, 2011, after 33 years on the show. It was his 1,097th commentary.

==Views==
Rooney claimed on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; to have a liberal bias, stating, &quot;There is just no question that I, among others, have a liberal bias. I mean, I&#x27;m consistently liberal in my opinions.&quot; In a controversial 1999 book, Rooney self-identified as agnostic, but by 2004 he was calling himself an atheist. He reaffirmed this in 2008. Over the years, many of his editorials poked fun at the concept of God and organized religion. Increased speculation on this was brought to a head by a series of comments he made regarding Mel Gibson&#x27;s film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004).

Though Rooney has been called Irish-American, he once said &quot;I&#x27;m proud of my Irish heritage, but I&#x27;m not Irish. I&#x27;m not even Irish-American. I am American, period.&quot;

In 2005, when four people were fired at CBS News perhaps because of the Killian documents controversy, Rooney said, &quot;The people on the front lines got fired while the people most instrumental in getting the broadcast on escaped.&quot; Others at CBS had &quot;kept mum&quot; about the controversy.

==Personal life==
Rooney was married to Marguerite &quot;Margie&quot; Rooney (née Howard) for 62 years, until she died of heart failure in 2004. He later wrote, &quot;her name does not appear as often as it originally did [in my essays] because it hurts too much to write it.&quot; They had four children: Ellen, Emily, Martha, and Brian. His daughter Emily Rooney is a TV talk show host and former ABC News producer who went on to host a nightly Boston-area public affairs program, &quot;Greater Boston&quot;, on WGBH. Emily&#x27;s identical twin, Martha Fishel, became chief of the Public Services Division at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland; her son Justin works as a producer for ABC News. His first daughter, Ellen Rooney, is a former film editor at ABC News and is now a travel and garden photographer based in London. His son, Brian Rooney, has been a correspondent for ABC since the 1980s and lives in Los Angeles.

Rooney also had a sister, Nancy Reynolds Rooney (1915–2007).

Rooney lived in the Rowayton section of Norwalk, Connecticut, and in Rensselaerville, New York, and was a longtime season ticket holder for the New York Giants.

==Death==
Rooney was hospitalized on October 25, 2011, after developing postoperative complications from an undisclosed surgical procedure, and died on November 4, 2011, at the age of 92, less than five weeks after his last appearance on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

<doc id="253672" wikidata="Q4868457" url="?curid=253672" title="Bat Boy (character)">
<text>Bat Boy is a fictional creature who made numerous appearances in the American supermarket tabloid &quot;Weekly World News,&quot; beginning with a front page story in 1992. The character became a pop-culture icon. In 1997, the story of Bat Boy was turned into an Off-Broadway musical, &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot;. 

== History ==
&quot;Weekly World News&quot; is a tabloid newspaper that publishes patently fabricated stories which were purported to be factual. Within the pages of the paper, Bat Boy is described as a creature who is &quot;half human and half bat&quot;. His pursuers, according to &quot;Weekly World News&quot;, are scientists and United States government officials; he is frequently captured, then later makes a daring escape. The original scientist who found him was named Dr. Ron Dillon. Another character, Matthew Daemon, S.O.S. (Seeker of Obscure Supernaturals), crossed paths with him in several stories. 

Bat Boy was created by former &quot;Weekly World News&quot; editor Dick Kulpa. Writer Bob Lind was assigned the story six weeks later. He debuted as a cover story on June 23, 1992. The original front-page photo of Bat Boy, showing his grotesque screaming face, was the second-best selling issue in the tabloid&#x27;s history, and he has since evolved into a pop-culture icon. He became the tabloid&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; mascot of sorts.

== In popular culture ==

=== &quot;Adventures of Batboy&quot; cartoon ===
Cartoonist Peter Bagge originally penned the &quot;Adventures of Batboy&quot; for the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. According to the cartoon, Bat Boy is currently hitchhiking with a typical American family after resigning from being the President of the United States (and King), has placed &quot;Weekly World News&quot; columnist Ed Anger under arrest and saying goodbyes to Beyoncé, a half sasquatch (with whom he was romantically involved), and Dr. Ron. In the strip, Bat Boy joins a death metal/thrash metal band as their lead singer. Cartoonist Danielle Corsetto, creator of webcomic &quot;Girls with Slingshots&quot;, took over from Bagge in 2005 and drew the strip until the &quot;WWN&quot; ceased publication in 2007.

=== &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot; ===
A musical based on the Bat Boy character premiered at Tim Robbins&#x27; Actors Gang Theatre on Halloween, 1997 and has since been produced Off Broadway, in London&#x27;s West End, and in scores of productions throughout the world. Music and lyrics are by Laurence O&#x27;Keefe, with a book by Brian Flemming and Keythe Farley.

<doc id="253675" wikidata="Q1277249" url="?curid=253675" title="Earl of Chester">
<text>The Earldom of Chester was one of the most powerful earldoms in medieval England, extending principally over the counties of Cheshire and Flintshire. Since 1301 the title has generally been granted to heirs apparent to the English throne, and after 1707 the British throne. From the late 14th century, it has been given only in conjunction with that of Prince of Wales.

==Honour of Chester and County Palatinate==
The County of Cheshire was held by the powerful Earls (or &quot;Counts&quot; from the Norman-French) of Chester from the late eleventh century, and they held land all over England, comprising &quot;the honour of Chester&quot;. By the late twelfth century (if not earlier) the earls had established a position of power as &quot;quasi&quot;-princely rulers of Cheshire that led to the later establishment of the County Palatine of Chester and Flint. Such was their power that &quot;Magna Carta&quot; set down by King John did not apply to Cheshire and the sixth earl was compelled to issue his own version.

==County palatine==
The earldom passed to the Crown by escheat in 1237 on the death of John the Scot, Earl of Huntingdon, seventh and last of the Earls. William III de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle, claimed the earldom as husband of Christina, the senior co-heir, but the king persuaded them to quitclaim their rights in 1241 in exchange for modest lands elsewhere. The other co-heiresses did likewise. It was annexed to the Crown in 1246. King Henry III then passed the Lordship of Chester, but not the title of Earl, to his son, the Lord Edward, in 1254; as King Edward I, this son in turn conferred the title and lands of the Earldom on his son, Edward, the first English Prince of Wales. By that time, the Earldom of Chester consisted of two counties: Cheshire and Flintshire.

The establishment of royal control of the Earldom of Chester made possible King Edward I&#x27;s conquest of north Wales, and Chester played a vital part as a supply base during the Welsh Wars (1275–84), so the separate organisation of a county palatine was preserved. This continued until the time of King Henry VIII. Since 1301, the Earldom of Chester has always been conferred on the Princes of Wales.

Briefly promoted to a principality in 1398 by King Richard II, who titled himself &quot;Prince of Chester&quot;, it was reduced to an earldom again in 1399 by King Henry IV. Whereas the Sovereign&#x27;s eldest son is automatically Duke of Cornwall, he must be made or created Earl of Chester as well as Prince of Wales.

The independent palatinate jurisdiction of Chester survived until the time of King Henry VIII (1536), when the earldom was brought more directly under the control of the Crown. The palatinate courts of Great Sessions and Exchequer survived until the reforms of 1830.

The importance of the County Palatinate of Chester is shown by the survival of Chester Herald in the College of Arms for some six hundred years. The office has anciently been nominally under the jurisdiction of Norroy King of Arms.

<doc id="253688" wikidata="Q392541" url="?curid=253688" title="Treaty of San Francisco">
<text>The , also called the , re-established peaceful relations between Japan and the Allied Powers on behalf of the United Nations by ending the legal state of war, military occupation and providing for redress for hostile actions up to and including World War II. It was signed by 49 nations on 8 September 1951, in San Francisco, California, at the War Memorial Opera House. Italy and China were not invited, the latter due to disagreements on whether the Republic of China or the People&#x27;s Republic of China represented the Chinese people. Korea was also not invited due to a similar disagreement on whether South Korea or North Korea represented the Korean people.

The treaty came into force on April 28, 1952. It ended Japan&#x27;s role as an imperial power, allocated compensation to Allied nations and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, ended the Allied post-war occupation of Japan, and returned full sovereignty to it. This treaty relied heavily on the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies&#x27; goals. In Article 11, Japan accepted the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and of other Allied War Crimes Courts imposed on Japan both within and outside Japan.

The 1951 treaty, along with the Security Treaty signed that same day, marks the beginning of the &quot;San Francisco System&quot;, which defines Japan&#x27;s relationship with the United States and its role in the international arena and characterizes Japan&#x27;s post-war history.

==Attendance==
===Present===
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Ceylon (currently Sri Lanka), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, State of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, Syria, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela attended the Conference.

===Absent===

China was not invited due to disagreements between the United States and the United Kingdom on whether the established but defeated Republic of China (in Taiwan) or the newly-formed People&#x27;s Republic of China (in mainland China) represented the Chinese people. The United States recognized the ROC government while Britain had recognized the PRC in 1950. Additionally, an internal US political debate had seen the Republican Party and US military supporting the Kuomintang and accusing President Truman of having abandoned the anti-communist cause.

Burma, India, and Yugoslavia were invited, but did not participate. India considered certain provisions of the treaty to constitute limitations on Japanese sovereignty and national independence. India signed a separate peace treaty, the Treaty of Peace Between Japan and India, for the purpose of giving Japan a proper position of honor and equality among the community of free nations, on June 9, 1952. Italy was not invited, despite its government having issued a formal declaration of war on Japan on July 14, 1945, a few weeks before the end of the war. Portugal was not invited, even though, despite its status as a neutral country during the war, its colony of East Timor had been invaded by Japan (the colony of Macau was not occupied but rather assigned Japanese &#x27;advisors&#x27; to its government). Pakistan, although it had not existed as a state at the time of the war, was invited because it was seen as a successor state to British India, a major combatant against Japan.

==Stances==
===Soviet Union&#x27;s opposition to the treaty===
The Soviet Union took part in the San Francisco conference, and the Soviet delegation was led by the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States and the United Kingdom. The Soviet delegation made several unsuccessful procedural attempts to stall the proceedings. The Soviet Union&#x27;s objections were detailed in a lengthy 8 September 1951 statement by Gromyko. The statement contained a number of the Soviet Union&#x27;s claims and assertions: that the treaty did not provide any guarantees against the rise of Japanese militarism; that China was not invited to participate despite being one of the main victims of the Japanese aggression; that the Soviet Union was not properly consulted when the treaty was being prepared; that the treaty sets up Japan as an American military base and draws Japan into a military coalition directed against the Soviet Union; that the treaty was in effect a separate peace treaty; that the draft treaty violated the rights of China to Taiwan and several other islands; that the draft treaty, in violation of the Yalta agreement, did not recognize the Soviet Union&#x27;s sovereignty over South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands; and other objections. It was not until 19 October 1956, that Japan and the Soviet Union signed a Joint Declaration ending the war and reestablishing diplomatic relations.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s objections to the treaty===
The ongoing Chinese Civil War and thus the question of which Chinese government was legitimate presented a dilemma to conference organizers. The United States wanted to invite the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan to represent China, while the United Kingdom wished to invite the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) on mainland China as China&#x27;s representative. As a compromise, neither government was invited.

===Sri Lanka&#x27;s defense of Japan===
A major player in providing support for a post-war free Japan was the delegation from Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka). While many were reluctant to allow a free Japan capable of aggressive action and insisted that the terms of surrender should be rigidly enforced in an attempt to break the spirit of the Japanese nation, the Ceylonese Finance Minister J. R. Jayewardene spoke in defense of a free Japan and informed the conference of Ceylon&#x27;s refusal to accept the payment of reparations that would harm Japan&#x27;s economy. His reason was &quot;We in Ceylon were fortunate that we were not invaded, but the damage caused by air raids, by the stationing of enormous armies under the South-East Asia Command, and by the slaughter-tapping of one of our main commodities, rubber, when we were the only producer of natural rubber for the Allies, entitles us to ask that the damage so caused should be repaired. We do not intend to do so for we believe in the words of the Great Teacher [Buddha] whose message has ennobled the lives of countless millions in Asia, that &quot;&#x27;hatred ceases not by hatred but by love&#x27;.&quot;&quot; He ended the same speech by saying:This treaty is as magnanimous as it is just to a defeated foe. We extend to Japan the hand of friendship and trust that with the closing of this chapter in the history of man, the last page of which we write today, and with the beginning of the new one, the first page of which we dictate tomorrow, her people and ours may march together to enjoy the full dignity of human life in peace and prosperity.

Minister Jayewardene&#x27;s speech was received with resounding applause. Afterwards, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;The voice of free Asia, eloquent, melancholy and still strong with the lilt of an Oxford accent, dominated the Japanese peace treaty conference today.&quot;

==Signatories and ratification==
Of the 51 participating countries, 48 signed the treaty; Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Soviet Union refused.

The signatories to the treaty were: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Ceylon (currently Sri Lanka), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Vietnam, Syria, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, Venezuela and Japan.

The Philippines ratified the San Francisco Treaty on July 16, 1956, after the signing of a reparations agreement between both countries in May of that year. Indonesia did not ratify the San Francisco Peace Treaty. Instead, it signed with Japan a bilateral reparations agreement and peace treaty on January 20, 1958. A separate treaty, the Treaty of Taipei, formally known as the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty, was signed in Taipei on April 28, 1952, between Japan and the ROC, just hours before the Treaty of San Francisco also went into effect on April 28. The apparent illogical order of the two treaties is due to the difference between time zones.

==Fate of Taiwan and other Japanese overseas territories==
According to the treaty&#x27;s travaux préparatoires, a consensus existed among the states present at the San Francisco Peace Conference that, while the legal status of the island of Taiwan is temporarily undetermined, it would be resolved at a later time in accordance with the principles of peaceful settlement of disputes and self-determination, ideas that had been enshrined in the UN Charter.

The document officially renounces Japan&#x27;s treaty rights derived from the Boxer Protocol of 1901 and its rights to Korea, Formosa and the Pescadores, Hong Kong (then a British colony), the Kuril Islands, the Spratly Islands, Antarctica and South Sakhalin.

Article 3 of the treaty left the Bonin Islands, Volcano Islands (including Iwo Jima), and the Ryukyu Islands, which included Okinawa and the Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama Islands groups, under a potential U.N. trusteeship. While the treaty provision implied that these territories would become a United Nations trusteeship, in the end that option was not pursued. The Amami Islands were eventually restored to Japan on 25 December 1953, with the Bonin and Volcano Islands restored on 5 April 1968. In 1969 U.S.-Japan negotiations authorized the transfer of authority over the Ryūkyūs to Japan to be implemented in 1972. In 1972, the United States&#x27; &quot;reversion&quot; of the Ryūkyūs occurred along with the ceding of control over the nearby Senkaku Islands. Both the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) argue that this agreement did not determine the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands.

The Treaty of Taipei between Japan and the ROC stated that all residents of Taiwan and the Pescadores were deemed as nationals of the ROC. Additionally, in Article 2 it specified that – 
&quot;It is recognised that under Article 2 of the Treaty of Peace which Japan signed at the city of San Francisco on 8 September 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the San Francisco Treaty), Japan has renounced all right, title, and claim to Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) as well as the Spratley Islands and the Paracel Islands.&quot; However, this treaty does not include any wording saying that Japan recognizes that the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan was transferred to the Republic of China.

Some supporters of Taiwan independence refer to the San Francisco Peace Treaty to argue that Taiwan is not a part of the Republic of China, for it does not explicitly state the sovereignty status of Taiwan after Japan&#x27;s renunciation. In 1955, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, co-author of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, affirmed that the treaty ceded Taiwan to no one; that Japan &quot;merely renounced sovereignty over Taiwan&quot;. Dulles said that America &quot;cannot, therefore, admit that the disposition of Taiwan is merely an internal problem of China.&quot; However, the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected this justification, arguing that the Instrument of Surrender of Japan accepts the Potsdam Declaration and the Cairo Declaration, which intends Taiwan and Penghu to be restored to the ROC. Supporters of Taiwan independence point out that the Potsdam Declaration and the Cairo Declaration were not treaties, but President Ma expressed that the Treaty of Taipei has voided the Treaty of Shimonoseki and recognizes that people of Taiwan and Penghu as Chinese nationality. In more recent years supporters of Taiwan independence have more often relied on arguments based on self-determination as implied in the San Francisco Peace Treaty and popular sovereignty, but the United Nations has consistently rejected such arguments.

By Article 11 Japan accepted the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and of other Allied War Crimes Courts both within and outside Japan and agreed to carry out the sentences imposed thereby upon Japanese nationals imprisoned in Japan.

The document further set guidelines for repatriation of Allied prisoners of war and renounces future military aggression under the guidelines set by the United Nations Charter. The document nullifies prior treaties and lays down the framework for Japan&#x27;s current status of retaining a military that is purely defensive in nature.

There is also some ambiguity as to over which islands Japan has renounced sovereignty. This has led to both the Kuril Islands dispute and the Senkaku Islands dispute.

==Compensation to Allied countries and POWs==

===Transfer of Japanese overseas assets===

In accordance with Article 14 of the Treaty, Allied forces confiscated all assets owned by the Japanese government, firms, organization and private citizens, in all colonized or occupied countries except China, which was dealt with under Article 21. China repossessed all Japanese assets in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, which included mineworks and railway infrastructure. Moreover, Article 4 of the treaty stated that &quot;the disposition of property of Japan and of its nationals...and their claims...against the authorities presently administering such areas and the residents...shall be the subject of special arrangements between Japan and such authorities.&quot; Although Korea was not a signatory state of the treaty, it was also entitled to the benefits of Article 4 by the provisions of Article 21.

Total amount of Japanese overseas assets in China was US$18,758,600,000 in 1945.

===Compensation to Allied POWs===
Article 16 of the San Francisco Treaty states:As an expression of its desire to indemnify those members of the armed forces of the Allied Powers who suffered undue hardships while prisoners of war of Japan, Japan will transfer its assets and those of its nationals in countries which were neutral during the war, or which were at war with any of the Allied Powers, or, at its option, the equivalent of such assets, to the International Committee of the Red Cross which shall liquidate such assets and distribute the resultant fund to appropriate national agencies, for the benefit of former prisoners of war and their families on such basis as it may determine to be equitable. The categories of assets described in Article 14(a)2(II)(ii) through (v) of the present Treaty shall be excepted from transfer, as well as assets of Japanese natural persons not residents of Japan on the first coming into force of the Treaty. It is equally understood that the transfer provision of this Article has no application to the 19,770 shares in the Bank for International Settlements presently owned by Japanese financial institutions.

Accordingly, Japan paid £4,500,000 to the Red Cross.

Article 16 has served as a bar against subsequent lawsuits filed by former Allied prisoners of war against Japan. In 1998, a Tokyo court ruled against a suit brought by former Allied POWs, citing the San Francisco Treaty.

===Allied territories occupied by Japan===

Article 14 of the treaty stated thatIt is recognized that Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war. Nevertheless it is also recognized that the resources of Japan are not presently sufficient, if it is to maintain a viable economy, to make complete reparation for all such damage and suffering and at the same time meet its other obligations. Therefore,Japan will promptly enter into negotiations with Allied Powers so desiring, whose present territories were occupied by Japanese forces and damaged by Japan, with a view to assisting to compensate those countries for the cost of repairing the damage done, by making available the services of the Japanese people in production, salvaging and other work for the Allied Powers in question.

Accordingly, the Philippines and South Vietnam received compensation in 1956 and 1959, respectively. Burma and Indonesia were not original signatories, but they later signed bilateral treaties in accordance with Article 14 of the San Francisco Treaty.

Japanese military yen issued by force in Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and other places for the economic advantage of Japan were not honored by them after the war. This caused much suffering, but the claims of the Hong Kong Reparation Association in 1993, in a Tokyo district court, failed in 1999. The court acknowledged the suffering of the Hong Kong people, but reasoned that the Government of Japan did not have specific laws concerning military yen compensation and that the United Kingdom was a signatory to the Treaty of San Francisco.

Regarding China, on September 29, 1972, the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China declared &quot;that in the interest of the friendship between the Chinese and the Japanese peoples, it renounces its demand for war reparation from Japan&quot; in article 5 of the &quot;Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;.

The last payment was made to the Philippines on July 22, 1976.

==Unresolved issues==
The absence of China at the table would later play a significant role in the South China Sea dispute, specifically regarding the overall diplomatic relationship (or lack thereof) between the United States and China. According to historian Rana Mitter, &quot;The absence of contact between the United States and China made the establishment of shared norms, or even areas of mutually acknowledged difference, impossible.&quot;

=== Status of Taiwan ===
Through the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan renounced all rights, privileges, and demands regarding Taiwan. However, ambiguous wording in the treaty about the political status of Taiwan (i.e. whether the territory of Taiwan was legally retroceded to the Republic of China in 1945) after Japan renounced all right, title, and claim concerning the island of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratly Islands, and the Paracel Islands in 1952 (with the ratification of this treaty in the ROC) has given rise to the Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan, which is one of the major theories within this debate. This particular theory is generally Taiwan independence-leaning since it offers evidence supporting the notion that Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan (whether ROC or PRC) is either illegitimate or temporary and must be resolved via the postcolonial principle of self-determination. Proponents of this theory generally do not claim that Japan still has or should have sovereignty over Taiwan, though there are exceptions.

=== Compensation for (South) Koreans ===
Because South Korea did not sign the treaty, it was not entitled to the benefits provided to by Article 14, so South Koreans directly affected by Japanese atrocities were not compensated upon the ratification. When relations between the two countries were normalized in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations, Japan agreed to pay settlements, including all claims under Article 4 of the Treaty of San Francisco, directly to the South Korean government. The South Korean government would then compensate individual victims on a case-by-case basis; however, the government at the time used the funds to develop Korea&#x27;s economy, and passed few reparations to individuals. Amid recent rising tensions, many victims of Japanese crimes maintain that Japan has not been held sufficiently to account, and have demanded reparations for those who have not been compensated. South Korea claims that the 1965 treaty was not intended to settle individual claims for Japanese war crimes and crimes against humanity; Japan claims that under the 1965 treaty, it is no longer legally responsible for compensating all victims.

<text>The Parker Morris Committee drew up an influential 1961 report on housing space standards in public housing in the United Kingdom titled &quot;Homes for Today and Tomorrow&quot;. The committee was led by Sir Parker Morris. Its report concluded that the quality of social housing needed to be improved to match the rise in living standards, and made a number of recommendations. The Committee took a functional approach to determining space standards in the home by considering what furniture was needed in rooms, the space needed to use the furniture and move around it, and the space needed for normal household activities.

Out of the report came the Parker Morris Standards. In 1963 these were set out in the Ministry of Housing&#x27;s &quot;Design Bulletin 6 – Space in the Home&quot;. The report provided typical dimensions for the typical items of furniture for which the dwelling designer should allow space, and provided anthropometric data about the space needed to use and move about furniture. The bulletin also laid out sample room plans for a terraced house.

In 1967 these space standards became mandatory for all housing built in new towns; this was extended to all council housing in 1969, although they had already been adopted by many local councils by then.

The mandatory nature of the standards was ended by the &quot;Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980&quot;, when the incoming Conservative government sought to reduce the cost of housing and, generally, public spending.

==Standards==
Among the standards are that:
* In one-, two- and three-bedroom dwellings, one flushing toilet is required, and it may be in the bathroom.
* A semi-detached or end-of-terrace house for 4 people should have a net floor area of .
* A dwelling for three or more people should have enclosed storage space for the kitchen of .
* Dwellings should be fitted with heating systems that maintain the kitchen and circulation space at , and the living and dining spaces at , when the external temperature is .

===Original 1961 Space Standards===
===Modified 1967 Space Standards===
==21st century==
In the private sector the Parker Morris Standards influenced the 1967 and subsequent standards set by the National House Builders&#x27; Registration Council, now the National House Building Council, but were not adopted as written. However, it is widely felt that most public and private sector housing being built in the 21st Century fails to meet the Parker Morris standards for floor and storage space, and this led to a decision in 2008 by the former government agency English Partnerships to re-introduce minimum standards that are 10% more generous than those of Parker Morris for developments on its own land.

Subsequently, The Office of the Mayor of London has also opted to move to adopt a Design Guide for Housing within the city, which will be 10% more generous than the Parker Morris Standards. This guide was published on 19 August 2010 and will be implemented from April 2011.

<text>Get Smart is an American comedy television series parodying the secret agent genre that had become widely popular in the first half of the 1960s with the release of the &quot;James Bond&quot; films. It was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, and had its television premiere on NBC on September 18, 1965. It starred Don Adams (who was also a director on the series) as agent Maxwell Smart (Agent 86), Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, and Edward Platt as The Chief. Henry said that they created the show at the request of Daniel Melnick to capitalize on James Bond and Inspector Clouseau, &quot;the two biggest things in the entertainment world today&quot;. Brooks described it as &quot;an insane combination of James Bond and Mel Brooks comedy&quot;.

The show generated a number of popular catchphrases during its run, including &quot;sorry about that, Chief&quot;, &quot;...and &quot;loving&quot; it&quot;, &quot;missed it by &quot;that much&quot;&quot;, and &quot;would you believe...&quot;. The show was followed by the films &quot;The Nude Bomb&quot; (a 1980 theatrical film made without the involvement of Brooks and Henry) and &quot;Get Smart, Again!&quot; (a 1989 made-for-TV sequel to the series), as well as a 1995 revival series and a 2008 film adaptation. In 2010, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Get Smart&quot;″s opening title sequence at number two on its list of TV&#x27;s top 10 credits sequences as selected by readers. The show switched networks in 1969 to CBS. It ended its five-season run on May 15, 1970, with a total of 138 episodes.

The Museum of Broadcast Communications found the show notable for &quot;broadening the parameters for the presentation of comedy on television&quot;.

==Premise==

The series centers on bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart (Adams), also known as Agent 86, and his unnamed female partner, Agent 99 (Feldon). They work for CONTROL, a secret U.S. government counterintelligence agency based in Washington, D.C., fighting against KAOS, &quot;the international organization of evil&quot;. While Smart always succeeds in thwarting KAOS, his incompetent nature and insistence on doing things &quot;by the book&quot; invariably cause complications.

The enemies, world-takeover plots, and gadgets seen in &quot;Get Smart&quot; were a parody of the &quot;James Bond&quot; film franchise. &quot;Do what they did except just stretch it half an inch&quot;, Mel Brooks said of the methods of this TV series.

==Production ==
Talent Associates commissioned Mel Brooks and Buck Henry to write a script about a bungling James Bond–like hero. Brooks described the premise for the show that they created in an October 1965 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article:

I was sick of looking at all those nice, sensible situation comedies. They were such distortions of life. If a maid ever took over my house like &quot;Hazel&quot;, I&#x27;d set her hair on fire. I wanted to do a crazy, unreal, comic-strip kind of thing about something besides a family. No one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the first.

Brooks and Henry proposed the show to ABC, where network executives called it &quot;un-American&quot; and demanded a &quot;lovable dog to give the show more heart&quot;, as well as scenes showing Maxwell Smart&#x27;s mother. Brooks strongly objected to the second suggestion:

They wanted to put a print housecoat on the show. Max was to come home to his mother and explain everything. I hate mothers on shows. Max has no mother. He never had one.

The cast and crew contributed joke and gadget ideas, especially Don Adams, but dialogue was rarely ad-libbed. An exception is the third-season episode &quot;The Little Black Book&quot;. Don Rickles encouraged Adams to misbehave, and he ad-libbed. The result was so successful that the single episode was turned into two parts.

The first four seasons on NBC were filmed at Sunset Bronson Studios, while the final season, shown on CBS, was filmed at CBS Studio Center.

===Production personnel ===
Brooks had little involvement with the series after the first season, but Henry served as story editor through 1967. The crew of the show included:

* Leonard B. Stern – executive producer for the entire run of the series
* Irving Szathmary – music and theme composer and conductor for the entire run
* Don Adams – director of 13 episodes and writer of two episodes
* David Davis – associate producer
* Gary Nelson – director of the most episodes
* Bruce Bilson – director of the second-most episodes
* Gerald C. Gardner and Dee Caruso – head writers for the series
* Reza Badiyi – occasional director
* Allan Burns and Chris Hayward – frequent writers and producers
* Stan Burns and Mike Marmer – frequent writers
* Richard Donner – occasional director
* James Komack – writer and director
* Arne Sultan – frequent writer and producer
* Lloyd Turner and Whitey Mitchell – frequent writers and producers of season five

==Characters ==
Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Smart, Agent 86, (Don Adams) is the central character of the series. Despite being a top-secret government agent, he is absurdly clumsy. Yet Smart is also resourceful, skilled in hand-to-hand combat, a proficient marksman, and incredibly lucky; all of this makes him one of CONTROL&#x27;s top agents. Brooks decided on Smart&#x27;s code number, 86, as a reference to the slang term, meaning to forcibly eject someone, such as a patron from a bar or casino.

In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Maxwell Smart number 19 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. The character appears in every episode (though only briefly in &quot;Ice Station Siegfried&quot;, as Don Adams was performing in Las Vegas for two weeks to settle gambling debts).

 (Barbara Feldon) works alongside 86 and is another one of the top agents at CONTROL. Her actual name is never revealed. In the episode &quot;A Man Called Smart Part 3&quot; (S2 E30), Max calls her Ernestine and she says, &quot;Too bad that&#x27;s not my name.&quot; In another episode, &quot;99 Loses CONTROL&quot; (S3 E19), she uses the name Susan Hilton, but later in the same episode tells Max that it is not her real name. When 99 marries Max in Season 4, Admiral Hargrade snores when the minister says her name, making it inaudible.

Several instances refer to her high level of professionalism; in one episode the Chief says an assignment requires extreme bravery and competence but since 99 isn&#x27;t available, Max could do it. According to Feldon, 99 is deeply in love with Max and either overlooks or understands his quirks, while he is clueless about her affection yet often demonstrates his care through his concern for her well-being.

 (Edward Platt) is the head of CONTROL. His first name is revealed to be Thaddeus but his surname is never revealed. On some occasions he uses the &quot;code name&quot; &quot;Harold Clark&quot; for outsiders, but this is understood among CONTROL agents not to be his real name. He is supportive of Agents 86 and 99 and considers them to be his two closest friends, but he is often frustrated with Smart. When he was a field agent, his code name was &quot;Q.&quot;

 (Robert Karvelas, Don Adams&#x27; cousin) is the Chief&#x27;s assistant, even more slow-witted and incompetent than Max.

Ludwig Von Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) is a recurring villain, and the vice president in charge of public relations and terror at KAOS, though his title does vary. Despite his gruff and proper demeanor, he is as incompetent as Max.

 (King Moody) is Siegfried&#x27;s equally ruthless but often inept chief henchman, prone to silly behaviors which annoy his boss as unbecoming of KAOS.

 (Dick Gautier) is a humanoid robot built by KAOS, but in his first mission, Smart manages to turn him to the side of CONTROL. Hymie had a tendency to take instructions too literally.

 (David Ketchum) is an agent who is usually stationed inside unlikely, sometimes impossibly small or unlucky places, such as cigarette machines, washing machines, lockers, trash cans, or fire hydrants. He tends to resent his assignments.

 (Victor French) Six episodes (1965–66). French&#x27;s first role was the insurance man in &quot;Too Many Chiefs&quot;, and subsequent episodes as Agent 44. He is the predecessor to Agent 13 in season 1. Agent 13 takes over the function of Agent 44 for seasons 2 to 4, but Agent 44, now played by Al Molinaro, returns in season 5.

Carlson (Stacy Keach Sr.) is a CONTROL scientist and inventor of such gadgets as an umbrella rifle (with a high-speed camera in the handle) and edible buttons.

Dr. Steele (Ellen Weston) is a beautiful, sexy, and brilliant CONTROL scientist who develops formulas while undercover as a dancer and strip-tease artist. She remains oblivious to Smart&#x27;s clearly discomfited attraction to her. The character appeared in three episodes in season 3, replaced the next season by Dr. Simon who has the same cover (played by different actresses in two episodes).

== Production notes ==

=== Gadgets ===
In &quot;Get Smart&quot;, telephones are concealed in over 50 objects, including a necktie, comb, watch, and a clock. A recurring gag is Max&#x27;s shoe phone (an idea from Brooks). To use or answer it, he has to take off his shoe. Several variations on the shoe phone were used. In &quot;I Shot 86 Today&quot; (season four), his shoe phone is disguised as a golf shoe, complete with cleats, developed by the attractive armorer Dr. Simon. Smart&#x27;s shoes sometimes contain other devices housed in the heels: an explosive pellet, a smoke bomb, compressed air capsules that propelled the wearer off the ground, and a suicide pill (which Max believes is for the enemy).

Agent 99 had her concealed telephones, as well. She had one in her makeup compact, and also one in her fingernail. To use this last device, she would pretend to bite her nail nervously, while actually talking on her &quot;nail phone&quot;.

On February 17, 2002, the prop shoe phone was included in a display titled &quot;Spies: Secrets from the CIA, KGB, and Hollywood&quot;, a collection of real and fictional spy gear that exhibited at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Flinders University in South Australia has researched medical applications for shoe phone technology after being inspired by the show.

Gag phones also appear in other guises. In the episode &quot;Too Many Chiefs&quot; (season one), Max tells Tanya, the KAOS informer whom he is protecting, that if anyone breaks in, to pick up the house phone, dial 1-1-7, and press the trigger on the handset, which converts it to a gun. The phone-gun is only used that once, but Max once carried a gun-phone, a revolver with a rotary dial built into the cylinder. In the episode &quot;Satan Place&quot;, Max simultaneously holds conversations on seven different phones: the shoe, his tie, his belt, his wallet, a garter, a handkerchief, and a pair of eyeglasses. Other unusual locations include a garden hose, a car cigarette lighter (with the lighter being hidden in the car phone), a bottle of perfume (Max complains of smelling like a woman), the steering wheel of his car, a painting of Agent 99, the headboard of his bed, a cheese sandwich, lab test tubes (Max grabs the wrong one and splashes himself), a Bunsen burner (Max puts out the flame anytime he pronounces a &quot;p&quot;), a plant in a planter beside the real working phone (operated by the dial of the working phone), and inside &quot;another&quot; full-sized working phone.

Other gadgets include a bullet-proof invisible wall in Max&#x27;s apartment that lowers from the ceiling, into which Max and others often walk; a camera hidden in a bowl of soup (cream of Technicolor) that takes a picture (with a conspicuous flash) of the person eating the soup with each spoonful; a mini magnet on a belt, which turns out to be stronger than KAOS&#x27;s maxi magnet; and a powerful miniature laser weapon in the button of a sports jacket (the &quot;laser blazer&quot;).

Another of the show&#x27;s recurring gags is the &quot;Cone of Silence&quot;. Smart would often insist on strictly following CONTROL&#x27;s security protocols; when discussing highly confidential things in the chief&#x27;s office, he would insist on speaking under the Cone of Silence—two transparent plastic hemispheres which are electrically lowered on top of Max and Chief and are supposed to prevent their conversation from being heard outside. It invariably malfunctions in various ways, making it difficult for the two to communicate. People outside the cone could often hear them better than they could hear themselves. The Cone of Silence was the idea of Buck Henry, though it was preceded in an episode of the syndicated television show &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot; titled &quot;Barrier of Silence&quot;, written by Lou Huston, that first aired on September 3, 1955, 10 years ahead of &quot;Get Smart&quot;. There was also a Portable Cone of Silence.

=== Cars ===

The car that Smart is seen driving most frequently is a red 1965 Sunbeam Tiger two-seat roadster. This car had various custom features, such as a machine gun, smoke screen, radar tracking, and an ejection seat. The Sunbeam Alpine, upon which the Tiger was based, was used by customizer Gene Winfield because the Alpine&#x27;s four-cylinder engine afforded more room under the hood than the V8 in the Tiger. AMT, Winfield&#x27;s employer, made a model kit of the Tiger, complete with hidden weapons. It is the only kit of the Tiger, and has been reissued multiple times as a stock Tiger.

Adams received the Sunbeam and drove it for 10 years after the end of the show. It was wrecked and repaired several times, and its current whereabouts are unknown.

In the black-and-white pilot episode only, Smart drives a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT PF Spider Cabriolet.

In the opening credits, the Tiger was used for seasons one and two. In seasons three and four, Smart drives a light blue Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, because Volkswagen had become a sponsor of the show. The Volkswagen was never used in the body of the show. In season five (1969–1970), Buick became a show sponsor, so the Tiger was replaced with a gold 1969 Opel GT, which also appears in the body of the show.

In season four (1968–1969), Adams uses a yellow Citroën 2CV in the wedding episode &quot;With Love and Twitches&quot;, and a blue 1968 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 convertible with a tan interior and four seats (as required by the plot) in the episodes &quot;A Tale of Two Tails&quot; and &quot;The Laser Blazer&quot;.

In the short-lived 1995 TV series, Smart is trying to sell the Karmann Ghia through the classified ads.

In &quot;Get Smart, Again!&quot;, Smart is seen driving a red 1986 Alfa Romeo Spider Veloce.

The Sunbeam Tiger, the Karmann Ghia, and the Opel GT all make brief appearances in the 2008 film. The Sunbeam Tiger is seen in the CONTROL Museum, along with the original shoe phone, which Smart also briefly uses. The Opel GT is driven by Bernie Kopell and is rear-ended by a truck. Smart steals the Karmann Ghia to continue his escape.

Both Bill Dana and Jonathan Harris, with whom Adams appeared on &quot;The Bill Dana Show&quot;, also appeared, as did Adams&#x27; father, William Yarmy, brother, Dick Yarmy, and daughter, Caroline Adams.

The series featured several cameo appearances by famous actors and comedians, sometimes uncredited and often comedian friends of Adams. Johnny Carson appeared, credited as &quot;special guest conductor&quot;, in &quot;Aboard the Orient Express&quot;. Carson returned for an uncredited cameo as a royal footman in the third-season episode &quot;The King Lives?&quot; Other performers to make cameo appearances included Steve Allen, Milton Berle, Ernest Borgnine, Wally Cox, Robert Culp (as a waiter in an episode sending up Culp&#x27;s &quot;I Spy&quot;), Phyllis Diller, Buddy Hackett, Bob Hope, and Martin Landau.

Actress Rose Michtom (the real-life aunt of the show&#x27;s executive producer Leonard Stern) appeared in at least 44 episodes—usually as a background extra with no speaking role. In the season-one episode &quot;Too Many Chiefs&quot;, when she is shown in a photograph, Max refers to her as &quot;my Aunt Rose&quot;, but the Chief corrects Max by saying that she is actually KAOS agent Alexi Sebastian disguised as Max&#x27;s Aunt Rose. Fans refer to her as &quot;Aunt Rose&quot; in all of her dozens of appearances, though her character is never actually named in most of them.

== Broadcast ==

The series was broadcast on NBC-TV from September 18, 1965, to September 13, 1969, after which it moved to the CBS network for its final season, running from September 26, 1969, to September 11, 1970, with 138 total episodes produced. During its five-season run, &quot;Get Smart&quot; broke the Nielsen Top 30 twice. It ranked at number 12 during its first season, and at number 22 during its second season, before falling out of the top 30 for its last three seasons. The series won seven Emmy Awards, and it was nominated for another 14 Emmys and two Golden Globe Awards. In 1995, the series was briefly resurrected starring Adams and Feldon with Andy Dick as Max&#x27;s and 99&#x27;s son Zack Smart and Elaine Hendrix as 66.

== Emmy awards ==
== Adaptations ==

=== Films ===
Four feature-length films have been produced following the end of the NBC/CBS run of the TV series:

*1980: &quot;The Nude Bomb&quot; (dir. Clive Donner)—also known as &quot;The Return of Maxwell Smart&quot; or &quot;Maxwell Smart and the Nude Bomb&quot;—was theatrically released. It was panned by critics and barely returned its budget at the box office.
*1989: The made-for-TV &quot;Get Smart, Again!&quot; (dir. Gary Nelson) on ABC
*2008: &quot;Get Smart&quot; (dir. Peter Segal) starring Steve Carell as Smart alongside Anne Hathaway as 99. Distributed by Warner Bros., the film includes a dedication to Adams and Platt, who had died in 2005 and 1974, respectively. It received mixed critical reviews but was a commercial success, earning over $230 million worldwide.
**2008: &quot;Get Smart&#x27;s Bruce and Lloyd: Out of Control&quot; (dir. Gil Junger), a made-for-DVD spin-off revolving around minor characters, Bruce and Lloyd (Masi Oka and Nate Torrence), the masterminds behind the high-tech gadgets that are often used by Smart.

In October 2008, it was reported that Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures and Mosaic Media Group were producing a sequel. Carell and Hathaway were set to return, but the status of other cast members had not been announced. As of 2019, &quot;Get Smart 2&quot; is no longer in development 

=== Television ===
&quot;Get Smart, Again!&quot; eventually prompted the development of a short-lived 1995 weekly series on Fox also titled &quot;Get Smart&quot;, with Adams and Feldon reprising their characters with Maxwell Smart now being the Chief of Control as their bumbling son, Zach (Andy Dick), becomes Control&#x27;s star agent (Zach&#x27;s twin sister is never seen nor mentioned – though the new leader of KAOS, a hidden female figure, would have been revealed as the other twin if the show had continued). And 99 is now a congresswoman. The beginning teaser shows Maxwell Smart and Zach driving to Control headquarters in a car wash separately; Smart, Zach and their secretary cram themselves into a secret elevator: a soda machine which &quot;disappears&quot;. (A cleaning lady sits down in the open space when all of a sudden the machine pops up and knocks the woman into the ceiling.) A late episode of the 1995 series shows that just as Siegfried is leaving a room, Maxwell Smart accidentally activates an atomic bomb just before the end of the show. (The teaser for the episode shows an atomic bomb going off.) This ending is similar to a device used by the &quot;Get Smart&quot;-inspired series &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; at the end of its first season. Hopes for the series were not high, as Andy Dick had already moved on to &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, which premiered weeks later in 1995.

With the revival series on Fox, &quot;Get Smart&quot; became the first television franchise to air new episodes (or made-for-TV films) on each of the aforementioned current four major American television networks, although several TV shows in the 1940s and 1950s aired on NBC, CBS, ABC and DuMont. The different versions of &quot;Get Smart&quot; did not all feature the original lead cast.

&quot;Get Smart&quot; was parodied on a sketch in the Mexican comedy show called , making fun of the Spanish title of the series () and the way the series is dubbed.

An early &quot;MadTV&quot; sketch titled &quot;Get Smarty&quot; placed the Maxwell Smart character in situations from the film &quot;Get Shorty&quot;.

An episode of &quot;F Troop&quot; called &quot;Spy, Counterspy, Counter–counterspy&quot; featured Pat Harrington Jr. imitating Don Adams as secret agent &quot;B. Wise&quot;.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade&quot; parodies the opening of &quot;Get Smart&quot; in the couch gag. Homer goes through many futuristic doors and passageways until he reaches the phone booth, falls through the floor, and lands on the couch, with the rest of the family already seated. This couch gag was later repeated in two other &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes: &quot;The Fat and the Furriest&quot; and &quot;A Star is Torn&quot;.

=== Adams in similar roles ===
In the 1960s, Adams had a supporting role on the sitcom &quot;The Bill Dana Show&quot; (1963–1965) as the hopelessly inept hotel detective Byron Glick. His speech mannerisms, catchphrases (&quot;Would you believe...?&quot;), and other comedy bits were adapted for his &quot;Maxwell Smart&quot; role in &quot;Get Smart&quot;.

When WCGV-TV, a new independent station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, signed on the air in 1980, Adams did in-house promos as Agent 86 to let viewers know when the reruns of &quot;Get Smart&quot; aired on the station by using his shoephone.

In one of Adams&#x27; five appearances as a guest passenger in the series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, his character, even when he thought he had been shot, makes no attempt to visit the ship&#x27;s doctor. The role of the doctor in &quot;The Love Boat&quot; was played by Bernie Kopell, who played Siegfried in &quot;Get Smart&quot;.

In 1982, Adams starred as Maxwell Smart in a series of local commercials for New York City electronics chain Savemart. The slogan was &quot;Get Smart. Get SaveMart Smart.&quot; In addition, Adams starred in a series of commercials for White Castle in 1992, paying homage to his &quot;Get Smart&quot; character with his catchphrase &quot;Would you believe...?&quot;

In the 1980s, Adams provided the (similar) voice of the titular bungling cyborg secret agent in the animated series &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. This later became a feature film in 1999 starring Matthew Broderick in the title role of Inspector John Brown Gadget (in which Adams had a cameo), and its prequel series &quot;Gadget Boy &amp; Heather&quot;. Neither was directly related to &quot;Get Smart&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, Adams reprised his role of Maxwell Smart for a series of telephone banking commercials for Empire of America Federal Savings Bank in Buffalo, New York. The telephone banking service was called SmartLine, and Sherwin Greenberg Productions (a video production company and bank subsidiary) produced radio and television ads, as well as a series of still photos for use in promotional flyers that featured Adams&#x27; Maxwell Smart character wearing the familiar trenchcoat and holding a shoe phone to his ear. The television commercials were videotaped in Sherwin Greenberg Productions&#x27; studio on a set that resembled an old alleyway which utilized fog-making machinery for special effect. The production company even secured a lookalike of the red Alpine that Adams used in the television series, making it a memorable promotion for those familiar with the series of nearly 20 years earlier.

In the late 1980s, Adams portrayed Smart in a series of TV commercials for Toyota New Zealand, for the 1990 model Toyota Starlet. While it is customary for the actor to go to the foreign location for shooting, Adams&#x27; apparent intense dislike of long-distance flying meant that the New Zealand specification car had to be shipped to the US for filming. He also appeared in another series of Canadian commercials in the late 1990s for a dial-around long-distance carrier. In the movie &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (1987), Adams played the Harbor Master, who used several of Maxwell Smart&#x27;s catchphrases (including an exchange in which Frankie Avalon&#x27;s character did a vague impression of Siegfried).

Adams played Smart in a 1989 TV commercial for Kmart. He was seen talking on his trademark shoe phone, telling the Chief about the great selection of electronics available at Kmart. An exact replica of himself approaches him, and Smart says, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me you&#x27;re a double agent.&quot; (This was a reference to a running gag on the original series, in which Max detected some sort of setback or danger, and would say to 99, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me...&quot; and then 99 replied by stating a confirmation of whatever Max was afraid to hear, to which Max would always respond, &quot;I &quot;asked&quot; you not to tell me that!&quot;)

Adams also appeared in a number of McDonald&#x27;s Hamburger Restaurant television commercials, which also featured numerous stars of TV series viewed as classic or with nostalgia, such as Barbara Billingsley from &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, Buddy Ebsen from &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, Bob Denver from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and Al Lewis from &quot;The Munsters&quot;.

Adams also starred in a Canadian sitcom titled &quot;Check It Out&quot; in which he played a supermarket manager. Adams&#x27; running jokes in &quot;Get Smart&quot;, such as &quot;the old [something something] trick&quot; and &quot;I told you not to tell me that!&quot; were used in the show but in a supermarket setting.

=== Books and comics ===
A series of novels based on characters and dialog of the series was written by William Johnston and published by Tempo Books in the late 1960s. Dell Comics published a comic book for eight issues during 1966 and 1967, drawn in part by Steve Ditko.

=== Proposed movies ===
The 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; movie, made during that TV show&#x27;s original run, prompted other television shows to propose similar films. The only one completed was &quot;Munster Go Home&quot; (1966), which was a box office flop, causing the cancellation of other projects, including the &quot;Get Smart&quot; movie. The script for that movie was turned into a three-part episode, &quot;A Man Called Smart&quot;, which aired on April 8, 15 and 22, 1967.

During the 1980s, Dick Gautier was set to star in a Hymie the Robot Spin-off film to be made for TV. Following Hymie being recalled and then refurbished by the government. The film was never produced due to legal issues surrounding the ownership of Get Smart.

=== Play ===
Christopher Sergel adapted a play in 1967, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, based on Brooks&#x27;s and Henry&#x27;s pilot episode.

==Home media and rights==
All five seasons are available as box sets in Region 1 (United States, Canada, and others) and Region 4 (Australia, New Zealand, and others). The Region 1 discs are published by HBO Home Video, and Region 4 by Time Life Video. Each Region 1 box contains 4 discs, while Region 4 editions have a 5th disc with bonus material. Region 4 editions are also available as individual discs with four to five episodes per disc. The Season 1 set was released in both regions in 2008. Seasons 2 and 3 box sets were released in Region 4 on July 23, 2008. Seasons 4 and 5 were released in Region 4 on November 5, 2008. Seasons 2–5 in Region 1 were released throughout 2009.

Another box set of the complete series is available in both regions, first published in 2006 by Time Life Video. In 2009 the Region 1 edition was replaced by an HBO edition, and became more widely available. All editions contain a 5th disc for each season, with bonus material. The set has 25 discs altogether.

The first four seasons were produced for NBC by Talent Associates. When it moved to CBS at the start of Season 5, it became an in-house production, with Talent Associates as a silent partner. The series was sold to NBC Films for syndication.

Over decades, U.S. distribution has changed from National Telefilm Associates to Republic Pictures, to Worldvision Enterprises, to Paramount Domestic Television, to CBS Paramount Domestic Television, to CBS Television Distribution, to the current distributor, CBS Media Ventures. For decades, the syndication rights of all but a handful of the fifth-season episodes (that season being originally co-owned by Talent Associates and CBS) were encumbered with restrictions and reporting requirements; as a result, most of that season was rarely seen in syndication (though they were shown with more regularity on Nick at Nite and TV Land). The distribution changes (including the loosening of restrictions on the fifth season) were the result of corporate changes, especially the 2006 split of Viacom (owners of Paramount Pictures) into two companies.

HBO owns the copyrights to the series itself, due to Time-Life Films&#x27; 1977 acquisition of Talent Associates. Home videos are distributed by HBO Home Video. For a time the DVD release was only available through Time-Life (a former Time Warner division). Warner Bros. Television owns international distribution rights.

On August 10, 2015, the entire series was officially released on digital streaming platforms for the first time in preparation for its 50th anniversary.

<text>The National House Building Council (NHBC), established in 1936, is the UK&#x27;s largest provider of new home warranties. NHBC is also the UK&#x27;s largest single Approved Inspector for Building Regulations. Other activities include the provision of services linked to house building and general construction; including energy ratings, health and safety, sustainability, and training. It also provides industry statistics and benchmarking services.

The NHBC is a non-profit distributing company, so reinvests &#x27;profit&#x27; in its activities to improve the quality of new homes to protect the interests of homeowners.

NHBC is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

== History ==
NHBC was originally set up as the National House Builders Registration Council (NHBRC) in the United Kingdom in 1936, with the primary purpose to increase the care and professionalism shown by house builders.

As a Registered Housebuilder under the voluntary scheme, houses were inspected during building, buyers were covered by a two-year warranty against major defects, and against the insolvency of the builder. By 1963, 26% of all housing was built by Registered Housebuilders.

In 1964 and 1965, changes were introduced, including the extension of the warranty to ten years. The NHBRC&#x27;s standards were upgraded in 1967, particularly in the provision of power outlets, kitchen design, and space heating; drawing on the recommendations of the Parker Morris Committee. By the end of 1970, 92% of new homes were built by NHBRC members.

In 1973, the name changed to the National House Building Council (NHBC), and the organisation became completely independent from government and house builders. It was approved by the Department of Trade as an insurance company.

==Services==

=== New home warranty and build standards ===
The NHBC states that its primary purposes are raising the construction standards of new homes in the United Kingdom (UK), and providing consumer protection for homebuyers through its 10-year Buildmark warranty. NHBC offers warranties for newly built or converted private housing, affordable housing, self-build homes and commercial premises located on mixed use housing schemes. Mortgage lenders in the UK will usually require that a warranty is in place before lending on a newly built property, as detailed in the Council of Mortgage Lenders&#x27; handbook. According to NHBC&#x27;s website, around 80% of new homes built in the UK each year have an NHBC 10-year warranty. 

Builders and developers who sell properties with NHBC warranties should adhere to NHBC&#x27;s guidance documents on construction contained in the NHBC Technical Standards, in addition to complying with Building Regulations in the UK.

NHBC inspectors visit building sites at key stages to check compliance with its Technical Standards. The stages are usually (but can sometimes be more): foundations, drainage, superstructure (e.g. brickwork), pre-plaster, and pre-handover to the buyer. For flats, they also inspect roof construction. The inspection process is not designed to check every detail of the build, but if NHBC is satisfied with the overall build quality they will issue the warranty for the new home/premises. If reportable items are found during the build NHBC may still class as an acceptable risk and pass the build anyway.

&#x27;Buildmark&#x27;, the NHBC warranty for private housing is split into two parts. In the first two years, the builder is responsible for fixing any defects caused by its failure to build to NHBC Technical Standards. If the builder fails to do this, or has gone out of business, NHBC may take responsibility to fix the defect. From the start of the third year, until the home is ten years old, NHBC is responsible for putting right defects to the structural and weather-proofing parts of the home caused by breaches of its Technical Standards but only if &#x27;damage&#x27; has occurred.

The NHBC issues a standard form of contract, which may be used to secure the contractual terms between a client and a builder. In the Appeal Court case of &quot;Robinson v Jones&quot; (2011), the &quot;reasonableness&quot; of certain of its clauses was tested out and they were found to comply with the requirements of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

=== Building Control ===
In 1985, under the Building Act 1984, the NHBC set up a subsidiary company; NHBC Building Control Services Ltd, and became the first private sector building control body licensed as an Approved Inspector, for the purpose of verifying that buildings are built in accordance with the building regulations across England and Wales. It is the largest single Approved Inspector in England and Wales; inspecting around 50% of all new-build properties in the UK, and assists builders to achieve compliance, and advises on Building Regulations for schemes ranging from residential developments to large commercial and mixed use sites.

=== Industry awards schemes ===
NHBC runs two national awards programmes: Pride in the Job, and the NHBC Health and Safety Awards.

=== Other services ===
NHBC offers a range of additional services to help builders comply with Building Regulations, health and safety legislation, and other construction rules. These include: energy rating services (SAP and SBEM), energy performance certificates, Code for Sustainable Homes, and BREEAM assessments, CDM co-ordination, health and safety audits, UKAS accredited testing for sound insulation and air tightness.

They also offer a wide range of training courses for building professionals, including construction related National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs).

NHBC compiles and distributes statistics and analysis about the UK housing market that are used by government and financial institutions, as well as homebuilders. Examples are the Housing Market Report, and the NHBC Quarterly Statistics. Purchasers of new homes are also surveyed, providing statistics about levels of customer satisfaction in their homes.

==Consumer Code for Home Builders==
NHBC was a founder member of The Consumer Code for Home Builders, which gives added protection and rights to the buyers of brand new homes. The aim of the Code is to ensure that new home buyers are given all the information they need about their new home before they sign contracts, and treated fairly afterwards.

==Criticism==
The NHBC was criticised on a 2010 edition of the BBC consumer television programme &quot;Watchdog&quot;, for failing to repair homes due to incorrect surveying of problem properties by relevant professionals, and thus failing to either compensate owners financially or fix any problems promptly, for newly built properties under their warranty.

NHBC apologised to the families featured in the &quot;Watchdog&quot; programme for any mistakes that were made during the handling of their claims. NHBC argued that the cases showed how complex construction issues can be, and that expert opinions from construction professionals could differ. They also stated that they resolve claims from around 15,000 homeowners each year on homes up to 10 years old, and also help to resolve around 5,000 disputes between homeowners and their builders each year.

In 2010/11, NHBC paid claims totalling £74.4 million.

Further criticism followed in 2017 with the BBC reporting &quot;growing concerns that the quality of homes being built has drastically dropped&quot; and one surveyor concluding that a client&#x27;s new home was &quot;unfit for habitation&quot; and in places &quot;unsafe&quot;. At the time the government was pressuring house developers to target the building 300,000 new homes a year.

<text>David Pearce (born April 1959) is a British transhumanist philosopher. He is the co-founder of the World Transhumanist Association, currently rebranded and incorporated as Humanity+. Pearce approaches ethical issues from a lexical negative utilitarian perspective.

Based in Brighton, England, Pearce maintains a series of websites devoted to transhumanist topics and what he calls the &quot;hedonistic imperative&quot;, a moral obligation to work towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life. His self-published internet manifesto, &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot; (1995), outlines how pharmacology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology and neurosurgery could converge to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience from human and non-human life, replacing suffering with &quot;information-sensitive gradients of bliss&quot;. Pearce calls this the &quot;abolitionist project&quot;.

Pearce grew up in Burpham, Surrey. His parents, grandparents and three of his great-grandparents were all vegetarian and his father was a Quaker. From a young age, Pearce was concerned with death and aging, and later the problem of suffering. He became a secular scientific rationalist around the age of 10 or 11.

Pearce received a scholarship to study Politics, Philosophy and Economics at the University of Oxford, but never finished his degree.

==Hedonistic transhumanism==
In 1995, Pearce set up BLTC Research, a network of websites publishing texts about transhumanism and related topics in pharmacology and biopsychiatry. He published &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot; that year, arguing that &quot;[o]ur post-human successors will rewrite the vertebrate genome, redesign the global ecosystem, and abolish suffering throughout the living world.&quot;

Pearce&#x27;s ideas inspired an abolitionist school of transhumanism, or &quot;hedonistic transhumanism&quot;, based on his idea of &quot;paradise engineering&quot; and his argument that the abolition of suffering—which he calls the &quot;abolitionist project&quot;—is a moral imperative. He defends a version of negative utilitarianism.

He outlines how drugs and technologies, including intracranial self-stimulation (&quot;wireheading&quot;), designer drugs and genetic engineering could end suffering for all sentient life. Mental suffering will be a relic of the past, just as physical suffering during surgery was eliminated by anaesthesia. The function of pain will be provided by some other signal, without the unpleasant experience.

A vegan, Pearce argues that humans have a responsibility not only to avoid cruelty to animals within human society but also to redesign the global ecosystem so that animals do not suffer in the wild. He has argued in favour of a &quot;cross-species global analogue of the welfare state&quot;, suggesting that humanity might eventually &quot;reprogram predators&quot; to limit predation, reducing the suffering of animals who are predated. Fertility regulation could maintain herbivore populations at sustainable levels, &quot;a more civilised and compassionate policy option than famine, predation, and disease&quot;. The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce&#x27;s influence.

==Humanity+ and other roles==
In 1998, Pearce co-founded the World Transhumanist Association, known from 2008 as Humanity+, with Nick Bostrom. Pearce is a member of the board of advisors.

Currently, Pearce is a fellow of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and sits on the futurist advisory board of the Lifeboat Foundation. He is also the director of bioethics of Invincible Wellbeing and is on the advisory boards of the Center on Long-Term Risk, the Organisation for the Prevention of Intense Suffering and since 2021 the Qualia Research Institute.

Until 2013, Pearce was on the editorial advisory board of the controversial and non-peer-reviewed journal &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot;. He has been interviewed by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (Germany) and on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Moral Maze&quot;, among others.

Pearce currently serves as an advisory board member for Herbivorize Predators, an organization whose mission is to discover how to transform carnivorous animals into herbivorous ones in order to minimize suffering across all species.

<text>Glipizide, sold under the brand name Glucotrol among others, is an anti-diabetic medication of the sulfonylurea class used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is used together with a diabetic diet and exercise. It is not indicated for use by itself in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin within half an hour and can last for up to a day.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, low blood sugar, and headache. Other side effects include sleepiness, skin rash, and shakiness. The dose may need to be adjusted in those with liver or kidney disease. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin and increases tissue sensitivity to insulin.
Glipizide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 42nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 14million prescriptions.

==Mechanism of action==
Glipizide sensitizes the beta cells of pancreatic islets of Langerhans insulin response, meaning that more insulin is released in response to glucose than would be without glipizide ingestion. Glipizide acts by partially blocking potassium channels among beta cells of pancreatic islets of Langerhans. By blocking potassium channels, the cell depolarizes, which results in the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. The resulting calcium influx encourages insulin release from beta cells.

==History==
It was patented in 1969, and approved for medical use in 1971. Glipizide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984.

<text>Glimepiride is an antidiabetic medication within the sulfonylurea class, primarily prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes. It is regarded as a second-line option compared to metformin, due to metformin&#x27;s well-established safety and efficacy. Use of glimepiride is recommended in conjunction with lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise. It is taken by mouth, reaching a peak effect within three hours and lasting for about a day.
Common side effects include headache, nausea, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include low blood sugar. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It works predominantly by increasing the amount of insulin released from the pancreas. It is classified as a second-generation sulfonylurea.
Glimepiride was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 64th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==

Glimepiride is indicated to treat type 2 diabetes; its mode of action is to increase insulin secretion by the pancreas. However it requires adequate insulin synthesis as prerequisite to treat appropriately. It is not used for type 1 diabetes because in type 1 diabetes the pancreas is not able to produce insulin.

==Contraindications==
Its use is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to glimepiride or other sulfonylureas.

== Adverse effects ==
Side effects from taking glimepiride include gastrointestinal tract (GI) disturbances, occasional allergic reactions, and rarely blood production disorders including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia. In the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased. Alcohol consumption and exposure to sunlight should be restricted because they can worsen side effects.

== Interactions ==
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as salicylates), sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, coumadin and probenecid may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of glimepiride. Thiazides, other diuretics, phothiazides, thyroid products, oral contraceptives, and phenytoin tend to produce hyperglycemia.

== Mechanism of action ==
Like all sulfonylureas, glimepiride acts as an insulin secretagogue. It lowers blood sugar by stimulating the release of insulin by pancreatic beta cells and by inducing increased activity of intracellular insulin receptors.

Not all secondary sulfonylureas have the same risk of hypoglycemia. Glibenclamide (glyburide) is associated with an incidence of hypoglycemia of up to 20–30%, compared to as low as 2% to 4% with glimepiride. Glibenclamide also interferes with the normal homeostatic suppression of insulin secretion in reaction to hypoglycemia, whereas glimepiride does not. Also, glibenclamide diminishes glucagon secretion in reaction to hypoglycemia, whereas glimepiride does not.

== Pharmacokinetics == 
Gastrointestinal absorption is complete, with no interference from meals. Significant absorption can occur within one hour, and distribution is throughout the body, 99.5% bound to plasma protein. Metabolism is by oxidative biotransformation, it is hepatic and complete. First, the medication is metabolized to M1 metabolite by CYP2C9. M1 possesses about of pharmacological activity of glimepiride, yet it is unknown if this results in clinically meaningful effect on blood glucose. M1 is further metabolized to M2 metabolite by cytosolic enzymes. M2 is pharmacologically inactive. Excretion in the urine is about 65%, and the remainder is excreted in the feces.
