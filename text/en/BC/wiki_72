<text>Geraniaceae is a family of flowering plants placed in the order Geraniales. The family name is derived from the genus &quot;Geranium&quot;. The family includes both the genus &quot;Geranium&quot; (the cranesbills, or true geraniums) and the garden plants called geraniums, which modern botany classifies as genus &quot;Pelargonium&quot;, along with other related genera.

The family comprises 830 species in five to seven genera. The largest genera are &quot;Geranium&quot; (430 species), &quot;Pelargonium&quot; (280 species) and &quot;Erodium&quot; (80 species).

==Description==

Geraniaceae are herbs or subshrubs. The &quot;Sarcocaulon&quot; are succulent, but other members of the family generally are not.

Leaves are usually lobed or otherwise divided, sometimes peltate, opposite or alternate and usually have stipules.

The flowers are generally regular, or symmetrical. They are hermaphroditic, actinomorphic (radially symmetrical, like in &quot;Geranium&quot;) or slightly zygomorphic (with a bilateral symmetry, like in &quot;Pelargonium&quot;). The calyx and the corolla are both pentamerous (with five lobes), petals and sepals are free and distinct. The androecium consists in two whorls of five stamens each, some of which can be unfertile; the pistil consists of five (less commonly three) merged carpels. The linear stigmas are free, and the ovary is superior. The nectaries are localised at the bases of the antesepalous stamens and are formed by the receptacle. &quot;Pelargonium&quot; has only one nectary gland on the adaxial side of the flower. It is hidden in a tube-like cavity which is formed by the receptacle. Flower morphology is conserved within Geraniaceae, but there is a large diversity in floral architecture. Flowers are usually grouped in cymes (e.g. in &quot;Geranium&quot;), umbels (e.g. in &quot;Pelargonium&quot;) or, more rarely, spikes.

&quot;Geraniaceae&quot; are normally pollinated by insects, but self-pollination is not uncommon. A number of species are pollinated by the fly &quot;Moegistorhynchus longirostris&quot;.

The fruit is a unique schizocarp made of five (or three) achenes, in the lower part the achenes are inside the calyx, while the upper part (the stylar beak) is the style of the flower, looking like a kind of long beak over the achenes. When the fruit is mature the style breaks into five (or three) hygroscopically active (ready to absorb water) bristles that curl, causing the achenes to be released.

=== Differences between the genera ===
&quot;California&quot; lacks filaments without anthers (called staminodes), but the lower half of the five fertile stamens is made much wider by a wing with a rounded top on each side of the narrow higher part of the filament that carries an anther. &quot;Geranium&quot; only has ten fertile stamens without wings and lacks staminodes, except for &quot;G. pusillum&quot; that only has five stamens. &quot;Monsonia&quot; only has fifteen fertile stamens, which are merged at their base into a ring or merged at their base in trios with the middle filament longer than the others, except for &quot;M. brevirostrata&quot; with only five stamens. &quot;Erodium&quot; has five staminodes and five fertile stamens, without wings. &quot;Pelargonium&quot; has ten filaments without wings, between two and seven of which are topped by anthers, while the remaining three to eight are staminodes lacking anthers, but it can easily be distinguished by having only one narrow tube-like nectary inside what looks like the flowerstalk.

== Taxonomy ==
Geraniaceae and Francoaceae are the two families included in the order Geraniales under the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification (APG IV). There has been some uncertainty in the number of genera to be included. Stevens gives seven genera listed here, while Christenhusz and Byng state five genera.

Stevens also lists four synonyms of &quot;Geranium&quot;:
&quot;Geraniopsis&quot; 
&quot;Neurophyllodes&quot; 
&quot;Robertianum&quot; 
&quot;Robertiella&quot;

&quot;Hypseocharis&quot;, with between one and three species, which comes from the south-west Andean region of South America, is considered the sister to the rest of the family. Some authors separate &quot;Hyspeocharis&quot; as a monogeneric family Hypseocharitaceae, while older sources placed it in the Oxalidaceae. The genus &quot;Rhynchotheca&quot; has also been separated into the Vivianiaceae.

The Geraniaceae have a number of genetic features unique amongst angiosperms, including highly rearranged plastid genomes differing in gene content, order and expansion of the inverted repeat.

=== Phylogeny ===
Recent comparison of DNA-fragments resulted in the following phylogenetic tree.
== Distribution and habitat ==

Most species are found in temperate or warm temperate regions, though some are tropical. &quot;Pelargonium&quot; has its centre for diversity in the Cape region in South Africa, where there is a striking vegetative and floral variation.

<doc id="250801" wikidata="Q2881846" url="?curid=250801" title="Guy Smiley">
<text>Guy Smiley is a fictional character on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; who was dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s favorite game show host&quot;. His skits are among those on the show that parody commercial media. Smiley has also hosted &quot;This Is Your Lunch&quot; and &quot;Here Is Your Life&quot;, a parody of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Guests who were profiled included a loaf of bread, a tooth and a tree (all aimed at teaching children how things are made). He has also hosted pageants for numbers and letters.

Joan Ganz Cooney cited the role as one of her favorite roles from his original performer Jim Henson, although it was his least favorite to perform, as the character had a boisterous voice which proved too hard on his throat. Due to this, the character&#x27;s dialogue was usually pre-recorded so that Henson could do multiple takes without straining his throat.

The character was mostly discontinued upon Henson&#x27;s death in 1990.

==Game shows==
Smiley has hosted many game show skits, such as:

* &quot;Can You Guess?&quot; — a satire of &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; — Three Muppets, a father, mother and son, each announce themselves as &quot;the mother of this family&quot;, and Grover (then called &quot;Billy Monster&quot;) has to guess which is the true mother. (The Smiley character was then named &quot;Big Bob&quot;.)
* &quot;Pick Your Pet&quot; — a blindfolded little girl Muppet, Betty Lou, must choose one of three animals (one a monster) as her own pet without being able to see any of them, after asking each of them how they would behave in her home as her pet and listening to their answers. (The Smiley character was then named &quot;Sonny Friendly&quot;.)
* &quot;The Mr. and Mrs. Game&quot; — the first skit in which the host was named Guy Smiley, this satire of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; featured a monster couple. The object was for the wife to guess her husband&#x27;s favorite color, food and sport without being told in advance, after Betty Lou took him into a soundproof booth so he couldn&#x27;t hear his wife&#x27;s answers.
* &quot;The Remembering Game&quot; — a spoof of &quot;Concentration&quot;, two contestants try to match prizes on a four-space board. In its one appearance, Cookie Monster and an Anything Muppet named Bill Smith didn&#x27;t like the prizes they had &quot;won&quot;, so they traded prizes after Cookie had won an airplane and Bill had won a cookie.
* &quot;What&#x27;s My Part?&quot; — a spoof of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; — Three blindfolded celebrities had to identify a body part before all three of them were disqualified (by asking a question that had a &quot;no&quot; answer). The first segment, featuring a nose, starred panelists Cookie Monster, Bennett Snerf and Arlene Frantic as noseless monsters. (The latter two were Muppet parodies of longtime &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; panelists Bennett Cerf and Arlene Francis). None of them guessed right and the nose won the game. The second segment, featuring a foot, starred Snerf, Frantic, and Professor Hastings as Anything Muppets with human features. Professor Hastings won the game by accident after he complains his foot fell asleep.
* &quot;What&#x27;s My Letter?&quot; – Based on the sixth track from the 1971 &quot;Sesame Street&quot; record &quot;The Muppet Alphabet Album&quot;, this sequence featured Smiley challenging Prairie Dawn to guess a particular letter of the alphabet.
* &quot;Get Wordy&quot; - a spoof of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Smiley reads a meaning of a phrase and contestants have to guess what the phrase is.
* &quot;Mystery Guest&quot; — a spoof of a term used on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; — The contestants, (Cookie Monster, Don Music and Sherlock Hemlock), must guess who the Mystery Guest is. In this clip, it was the letter X, but nobody guessed correctly, and it turned out that the letter X belonged in the exit sign. After the contestants left, The announcer blurts &quot;You sure fooled them, X.&quot; It ran once.
* &quot;Beat the Time&quot; — a spoof of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; — The contestant must bring in a number of things that rhyme with the key word or contain something. In one segment, Cookie Monster must find three things that rhyme with &quot;rain&quot;, and will win a cookie if successful before the arrow on the clock reaches zero. Cookie manages to find a cane he stole from an old man, a chain holding a monster (Frazzle) and, at the last second, arrives onto the stage by smashing through the wall with a train (the same train he rode in &quot;The Ballad of Casey McPhee&quot;). It ran for four segments. Another segment involved the Count, where the Count has to bring in two things that come from the sky (his thunder and lightning when he counts). This is the one where Smiley reveals his real name to be Bernie Liederkranz. In the next segment, Elmo had to three things that starts the SN sound. He found a snack of nuts and raisins he stole from a business man, A sneaker worn by Telly, and a Snuffleupagus. Elmo successfully did it before the arrow on the clock reaches zero, And Elmo&#x27;s prize also started with a SN sound: A snowman wearing a Snorkel. 
* &quot;Bring that Thing&quot; = a spoof of a term used on &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; - The contestants are Stevie and Jonathan Martians (AKA The Yip-Yips). The martians must find 3 things in 30 seconds that helps them see at night. They found flashlight, A lamp, and they used their spaceship to bring the moon. The grand prize of a jar of fireflies.
* &quot;To Tell a Face&quot; — a spoof of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; — A Baby must figure out who is real person out of three panelists. It ran for seven segments.
* &quot;The Triangle Is Right&quot; — A spoof on the title &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; — Every question is answered with the response, &quot;A triangle&quot; (a possible indirect reference to the real-life quiz show scandals of the &#x27;50s). It was short-lived.
* &quot;What&#x27;s My Job?&quot; — another spoof of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; - The three contestant monsters have to figure out what the person&#x27;s job is. Round 1 was a firefighter, Round 2 was a dentist, and Round 3 was another game show host named Sonny Friendly (who thinks Guy Smiley is a guest). They argued at the end leaving with Guy Smiley remarking &quot;This whole thing was a rotten idea! Who put this man on the show?&quot; His suit was provided by Sierra Lagoon, while Sonny Friendly&#x27;s suit was provided by Frederick La Frensworth.
* &quot;Say the Word&quot; — a spoof of &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; - The contestants are Chet O&#x27;Leary and Maurice Monster. Guy gives Chet the word &quot;STOP&quot; but Chet cannot say that word but give out clues to Maurice Monster on the word. He tickles Maurice Monster until Maurice yells &quot;STOP!&quot; and Guy Smiley blurted &quot;That&#x27;s right. You said the word STOP! Congratulations!&quot;
* &quot;Name that Sound!&quot; — a spoof of &quot;Name That Tune&quot; There were two skits.
** Grover: Grover has to guess the three sounds (Such as a train whistle, a dog barking, and faucet dripping). He got them all right, but after he guessed the faucet dripping, it got flooded.
** Honker: A Honker has to figure out the sounds but since Guy Smiley couldn&#x27;t understand them, the Honker brings in things that have been mentioned by the sounds (Such as a cow, a horse, and a fire engine).
* &quot;Dialing for Prizes Movie&quot; — a spoof of &quot;Dialing for Dollars&quot; The lucky contestant is Mr. Lucky. And the lucky word is &quot;Fur&quot;. And the prizes are furry monsters.
* &quot;Here is Your Life&quot; — a spoof of &quot;This is Your Life&quot; - Guy Smiley honors the contestant (usually a certain object) They include:
** an oak tree
** a loaf of bread
** a tooth
** a right foot sneaker
** a painting of a bowl of fruit
** a house (2102 Shady Lane)
** a carton of eggs
* &quot;The Letter of the Day Pageant&quot; — a spoof of &quot;Miss America Pageant&quot; in which all letters compete. The letter S can swim; the letter C addresses herself as the letter C; and the letter T can tap dance. Up came the vowel finalists, A, E, I, O, and U. The letter E wins the pageant, and Guy Smiley sings him a song about the letter E to honor the winner.
* &quot;The How Many Game&quot; - an unknown spoof. The Two Headed Monster are the contestants in a Guy Smiley game show. The screen reveals the number 2. They have only 30 seconds to find two things. But they found 1 bowling ball, three cows, and four sheeps. They found out they have two heads.
* &quot;Happiness Begins at 40&quot; - The contestants are &quot;The Sad Family&quot; from Miserable Falls Colorado. They enter the studio sobbing dramatically, But gradely counts up to 40 to improve their emotion. They become happy when they reach to the number 40. When they become joyful, Guy Smiley remarks &quot;Well, I guess this proves that Happiness does begin at 40.&quot;

==Other appearances==
In &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s premiere season (1969–70), Smiley sang Allie Wrubel and Herb Magidson&#x27;s 1937 song &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; while a strong wind was blowing away a tree, a house, a woman, and ultimately his clothes. This segment was also dubbed in Spanish for international broadcasts.

Also that season, Smiley hosted the first segment of &quot;The Answer Lady&quot;, featuring an elderly woman named Granny Fanny Nesselrode who claimed she had the answer to everything but never gave the best answer to any question sent in by a viewer. Smiley was later replaced by a regionally accented Muppet host who bore some resemblance to him.

Smiley did make some appearances that didn&#x27;t have anything notable to do with his hosting career. When Cookie Monster was in a bakery chewing up items that rhymed with the word &quot;buy&quot;, Smiley came in announcing he was &quot;Guy Smiley, star of daytime television&quot;. At this point, Cookie couldn&#x27;t remember that it was a pie he was after, and the repeated use of words that did rhyme with &quot;pie&quot; did nothing to jog his memory. The scene ended with him wrongly realizing that the rhyming item was &quot;GUY!&quot;, and chasing Smiley around the bakery, trying to eat his hand off.

He also appeared in a sketch featuring Grover as an Elevator Operator. It was to teach kids to face the front of an elevator. In this sketch, &quot;Mr. Smiley&quot; (as Grover calls him) is also voiced by Jim Henson, but with a different voice than that of his game show personality.

In one movie theatre skit with Bert and Ernie, using Smiley as a one-line extra, the character is puppeted by Richard Hunt.

In a counting skit, Guy Smiley also took his entire studio audience to lunch, hoping there would be a big enough table. While there was a table for the 39 members of the audience, there was no available table for 40, forcing Smiley to sit outside and be sent the bill later.

Guy Smiley also appeared in &quot;Alphabet Chat&quot; doing a commercial for &quot;Bow Wow Chow&quot; while Mr. Chatterly was trying to do a lecture about the letter R.

He also appeared in &quot;On Vacation With Guy Smiley&quot;, in which he tried to photograph various animals in the jungle, but his loud voice kept scaring them off. At least until a tiger (Martin P. Robinson) came along, roaring and scaring away Guy&#x27;s guide (Richard Hunt), but the tiger took the camera and took Guy&#x27;s picture with the other animals. His pith helmet was provided by Zimbabwe After Six.

Smiley shows up as a non-speaking background extra (wearing an odd, unusually stern expression) along with many other Muppets in the musical skit &quot;Some/None&quot;.

Guy Smiley also hosted the banquet meeting of things that begin with &quot;SH&quot; sound. Including a shirt, a shovel, a shrimp, a sheep with a shepherd, and even a short sized king.

==Casting history==
*Jim Henson: &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Season 1 (1969) – Season 21 (1990)
*Don Reardon: CD-ROM games (voice only)
*Eric Jacobson: &quot;Sesame Street Presents: The Body&quot; (2005) – present

==International==
&quot;Sesame Street&quot; is localized for international markets, where Smiley is often renamed. In Portugal, for example, he&#x27;s &quot;Carlos Luz&quot;, a play on words with the name of television presenter Carlos Cruz. In the Netherlands, he is called &quot;Henk Glimlach&quot;, &quot;glimlach&quot; meaning &quot;smile&quot;. In Germany, he appears simply as &quot;Robert&quot;, possibly after Robert Lembke, a game show host.

<doc id="250807" wikidata="Q2846583" url="?curid=250807" title="Sir Andrew Clark, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Andrew Clark, 1st Baronet (28 October 18266 November 1893), was a Scottish physician and pathologist.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Aberdeen, the illegitimate son of Amelia Anderson and Andrew Clark. His mother died at his birth, and his father, who also was a physician, died when he was seven years old. After attending school in Aberdeen, he was sent by his guardians, two wealthy uncles, to Dundee, attending the High School of Dundee and was then apprenticed to a pharmacist. On returning to Aberdeen, he began his medical studies at the University of Aberdeen. Soon, however, he went to Edinburgh, where in the extra-academical school he had a student&#x27;s career of the most brilliant description, ultimately becoming assistant to Dr John Hughes Bennett in the Pathology Department of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and assistant demonstrator of anatomy to Robert Knox. But symptoms of tuberculosis brought his academic life to a close and, in the hope that the sea might benefit his health, he joined the medical department of the Royal Navy in 1848.

==Career==
In 1849 he became pathologist to the Haslar Hospital where T.H. Huxley was one of his colleagues and in 1853 he was the successful candidate for the newly instituted post of curator to the museum of the London Hospital. There he intended to devote all his energies to pathology, but circumstances brought him into active medical practice. In 1854, the year in which he took his doctor&#x27;s degree at Aberdeen, the post of assistant physician to the hospital became vacant and he was prevailed upon to apply for it. He was fond of telling how his tuberculosis tendencies gained him the appointment. &quot;He is only a poor Scotch doctor,&quot; it was said, &quot;with but a few months to live; let him have it.&quot; He had it, and two years before his death publicly declared that of those who were on the staff of the hospital at the time of his selection he was the only one remaining alive.

In 1854, he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1858 a fellow, and then went in succession through all the offices of honour the college has to offer, ending in 1888 with the presidency, which he continued to hold until his death. From the time of his selection as assistant physician to the London Hospital, his fame rapidly grew until he became a fashionable doctor with one of the largest practices in London, counting among his patients some of the most distinguished men of the day. The great number of persons who passed through his consulting-room every morning rendered it inevitable that to a large extent his advice should become stereotyped and his prescriptions often reduced to mere stock formulae, but in really serious cases he was not to be surpassed in the skill and carefulness of his diagnosis and in his attention to detail. 

==Honours==
He delivered the Lumleian Lectures in 1867 and the Croonian Lecture in 1885 to the Royal College of Physicians, both on the subject of pulmonary conditions.

He was created a baronet in 1883 in recognition of his services to medical science. He was elected the same year President of the Clinical Society of London. 

In June 1885 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. 

He was elected President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1892.

==Writing==
In spite of the claims of his practice he found time to produce a good many books, all written in the precise and polished style on which he used to pride himself. Doubtless owing largely to personal reasons, lung diseases and especially lung fibrosis formed his favourite theme, but he also discussed other subjects, such as kidney failure, anemia, constipation, etc.

==Personal life==
In 1891, his daughter Mary Kane married zoologist Oldfield Thomas.

==Death==
He died in London, after a paralytic stroke, and was buried at Essenden, near his country house at Hatfield, Hertfordshire.

<doc id="250811" wikidata="Q182921" url="?curid=250811" title="Reza Shah">
<text>Reza Shah Pahlavi (15 March 1878 – 26 July 1944) was shah of Iran from 1925 to 1941 and founder of the Pahlavi dynasty. Originally a military officer, he became a politician, serving as minister of war and prime minister of Iran, and was elected shah following the deposition of the last monarch of the Qajar dynasty. Reza Shah&#x27;s reign ended when he was forced to abdicate after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Mohammad Reza Shah. A moderniser, Reza Shah clashed with the Shia clergy and introduced social, economic, and political reforms during his reign, ultimately laying the foundations of the modern Iranian state. Therefore, he is regarded by many as the founder of modern Iran.

At the age of 14, Reza Shah joined the Persian Cossack Brigade, and also served in the army. In 1911, he was promoted to first lieutenant; he was elevated to the rank of captain by 1912, and he became a colonel by 1915. In February 1921, as leader of the entire Cossack Brigade based in Qazvin province, he marched towards Tehran and seized the capital. He forced the dissolution of the government and installed Zia ol Din Tabatabaee as the new prime minister. Reza Khan&#x27;s first role in the new government was commander-Afaqn-chief of the army and the minister of war.

Two years after the coup, Seyyed Zia appointed Reza Pahlavi as Iran&#x27;s prime minister, backed by the compliant national assembly of Iran. In 1925, Reza Pahlavi was appointed as the legal monarch of Iran by the decision of Iran&#x27;s constituent assembly. The assembly deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Qajar shah, and amended Iran&#x27;s 1906 constitution to allow the election of Reza Pahlavi as the Shah of Iran. He founded the Pahlavi dynasty that lasted until it was overthrown in 1979 by the Iranian Revolution. In the spring of 1950, he was posthumously named as Reza Shah the Great () by Iran&#x27;s National Consultative Assembly.

His legacy remains controversial to this day. His defenders say that he was an essential reunifying and modernising force for Iran, while his detractors (particularly the Islamic Republic of Iran) assert that his reign was often despotic, with his failure to modernise Iran&#x27;s large peasant population eventually sowing the seeds for the Iranian Revolution nearly four decades later, which ended over 2,500 years of Iranian monarchy. Moreover, his insistence on ethnic nationalism and cultural unitarism, along with forced detribalisation and sedentarisation, resulted in the suppression of several ethnic and social groups. Although he was of Iranian Mazanderani descent, his government carried out an extensive policy of Persianization trying to create a single, united and largely homogeneous nation, similar to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s policy of Turkification in Turkey after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.

==Early life==
Reza Shah Pahlavi was born in the town of Alasht in Savadkuh County, Mazandaran province, in 1878, to son of Major Abbas-Ali Khan and wife Noush-Afarin. His mother, Nush Afarin Ayromlu, was an immigrant from Georgia or Iravan (then part of the Russian Empire), whose family had emigrated to Qajar Iran when it was forced to cede all of its territories in the Caucasus following the Russo-Persian Wars several decades prior to Reza Shah&#x27;s birth. His father was a Mazanderani, a member of the Palani clan, who was commissioned in the 7th Savadkuh Regiment, and served in the Second Herat War of 1856.

Abbas-Ali died suddenly on 26 November 1878, when Reza was 8 months old. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Reza and his mother moved to her brother&#x27;s house in Tehran. She remarried in 1879 and left Reza to the care of his uncle. In 1882, his uncle in turn sent Reza to a family friend, Amir Tuman Kazim Khan, an officer in the Persian Cossack Brigade, in whose home he had a room of his own and a chance to study with Kazim Khan&#x27;s children with the tutors who came to the house. When Reza was sixteen years old, he joined the Persian Cossack Brigade. In 1903, when he was 25 years old, he is reported to have been guard and servant to the Dutch consul general Fridolin Marinus Knobel. Maurits Wagenvoort, who met and spoke to Reza at a meeting of the &quot;Babi-circle of Hadsji Achont&quot; in Tehran in 1903, in a publication from 1926 speaks of him as the &quot;gholam of His Presence the Dutch Consul&quot; and noted his very keen interest in Western politics.

Reza served in the Imperial Army. His initial career started as a private under Qajar Prince Abdol-Hossein Farman Farma&#x27;s command. Farman Farma noted that Reza had potential and sent him to military school where he gained the rank of gunnery sergeant. In 1911, he gave a good account of himself in later campaigns and was promoted to First Lieutenant. His proficiency in handling machine guns elevated him to the rank equivalent to captain in 1912. By 1915, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. His record of military service eventually led him to a commission as a brigadier general in the Persian Cossack Brigade. In November 1919, he chose the last name Pahlavi, which later became the name of the dynasty he founded.

==Rise to power==
===1921 coup===
In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Persia had become a battleground. In 1917, Britain used Iran as the springboard to launch an expedition into Russia as part of their intervention in the Russian Civil War on the side of the White movement. The Soviet Union responded by annexing portions of northern Persia, creating the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic. The Soviets extracted ever more humiliating concessions from the Qajar government, whose ministers Ahmad Shah was often unable to control. By 1920, the government had lost virtually all power outside its capital: British and Soviet forces exercised control over most of the Iranian mainland. In late 1920, the Soviets in Rasht prepared to march on Tehran with &quot;a guerrilla force of 1,500 Jangalis, Kurds, Armenians, and Azerbaijanis&quot;, reinforced by the Soviet Red Army. This, along with various other unrest in the country, created &quot;an acute political crisis in the capital&quot;.
On 14 January 1921, the commander of the British Forces in Iran, General Edmund &quot;Tiny&quot; Ironside, promoted Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan led his 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade, based in Niyarak, Qazvin, and Hamadan, to Tehran and seized the capital. He forced the dissolution of the previous government and demanded that Zia ol Din Tabatabaee be appointed prime minister. Reza Khan&#x27;s first role in the new government was as commander of the Iranian Army, which he combined with the post of Minister of War. He took the title Sardar Sepah (), or Commander-in-Chief of the Army, by which he was known until he became Shah. While Reza Khan and his Cossack brigade secured Tehran, the Persian envoy in Moscow negotiated a treaty with the Bolsheviks for the removal of Soviet troops from Persia. Article IV of the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship allowed the Soviets to invade and occupy Persia, should they believe foreign troops were using it as a staging area for an invasion of Soviet territory.

The coup d&#x27;état of 1921 was partially assisted by the British government, which wished to halt the Bolsheviks&#x27; penetration of Iran, particularly because of the threat it posed to the British Raj. It is thought that the British provided &quot;ammunition, supplies and pay&quot; for Reza&#x27;s troops. On 8 June 1932, a British Embassy report states that the British were interested in helping Reza Shah create a centralizing power. General Ironside gave a situation report to the British War Office saying that a capable Persian officer was in command of the Cossacks and this &quot;would solve many difficulties and enable us to depart in peace and honour&quot;. Reza Khan spent the rest of 1921 securing Iran&#x27;s interior, responding to a number of revolts that erupted against the new government. Among the greatest threats to the new administration were the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic, which had been established in Gilan, and the Kurds of Khorasan.

==Overthrow of the Qajar dynasty==
From the beginning of the appointment of Reza Khan as the minister of war, there was ever increasing tension with Zia ol Din Tabatabaee, who was prime minister at the time. Zia ol Din Tabatabaee wrongly calculated that when Reza Khan was appointed as the minister of war, he would relinquish his post as the head of the Persian Cossack Brigade, and that Reza Khan would wear civilian clothing instead of the military attire. This erroneous calculation by Zia ol Din Tabatabaee backfired and instead it was apparent to people who observed Reza Khan, including members of parliament, that he (and not Zia ol Din Tabatabaee) was the one who wielded power.

By 1923, Reza Khan had largely succeeded in securing Iran&#x27;s interior from any remaining domestic and foreign threats. Upon his return to the capital he was appointed prime minister, which prompted Ahmad Shah to leave Iran for Europe, where he would remain (at first voluntarily, and later in exile) until his death. It induced the Parliament to grant Reza Khan dictatorial powers, who in turn assumed the symbolic and honorific styles of &quot;Janab-i-Ashraf&quot; (His Serene Highness) and &quot;Hazrat-i-Ashraf&quot; on 28 October 1923. He quickly established a political cabinet in Tehran to help organize his plans for modernization and reform.

By October 1925, Reza Khan succeeded in pressuring the Majlis to depose and formally exile Ahmad Shah, and instate him as the next Shah of Iran. Initially, he had planned to declare the country a republic, as his contemporary Atatürk had done in Turkey, but abandoned the idea in the face of British and clerical opposition. The Majlis, convening as a constituent assembly, declared him the Shah (King) of Iran on 12 December 1925, pursuant to the Persian Constitution of 1906. Three days later, on 15 December, he took his imperial oath and thus became the first shah of the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Shah&#x27;s coronation took place much later, on 25 April 1926. It was at that time that his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was proclaimed crown prince.

==Rule as the Shah==

While the Shah left behind no major thesis, or speeches giving an overarching policy, his reforms indicated a striving for an Iran which—according to scholar Ervand Abrahamian—would be &quot;free of clerical influence, nomadic uprisings, and ethnic differences&quot;, on the one hand, and on the other hand would contain &quot;European-style educational institutions, Westernized women active outside the home, and modern economic structures with state factories, communication networks, investment banks, and department stores.&quot; Reza is said to have avoided political participation and consultation with politicians or political personalities, instead embracing the slogan &quot;every country has its own ruling system and ours is a one man system&quot;. He is also said to have preferred punishment to reward in dealing with subordinates or citizens.

Reza Shah&#x27;s reign has been said to have consisted of &quot;two distinct periods&quot;. From 1925 to 1933, figures such as Abdolhossein Teymourtash, Nosrat ol Dowleh Firouz, and Ali-Akbar Davar and many other western-educated Iranians emerged to implement modernist plans, such as the construction of railways, a modern judiciary and educational system, and the imposition of changes in traditional attire, and traditional and religious customs and mores. In the second half of his reign (1933–1941), which the Shah described as &quot;one-man rule&quot;, strong personalities like Davar and Teymourtash were removed, and secularist and Western policies and plans initiated earlier were implemented.

===Modernization===
During Reza Shah&#x27;s sixteen years of rule, major developments, such as large road construction projects and the Trans-Iranian Railway were built, modern education was introduced and the University of Tehran, the first Iranian university, was established. The number of modern industrial plants increased 17-fold under Reza Shah (excluding oil installations), and the number of miles of highway increased from 2,000 to 14,000. He founded 100,000-man army (previously, the shah had relied on tribal forces who were rewarded with plunder from the enemy), 90,000-man civil service. He set up free, compulsory education for both males and females and shut down private religious schools—Islamic, Christian, Jewish, etc. He confiscated land and real estate from the wealthy shrine endowments at Mashhad and Qom, etc. In Mashhad, the revenues of the sanctuary of Imam Reza helped finance secular education, build a modern hospital, improve the water supply of the city, and underwrite industrial enterprises.&quot;
In 1923, Reza Khan, then Sardar Sepah (Commander in Chief), visited Susa, the main site of French excavation in Iran. Enraged by the sight of a large European castle with a French flag, he remarked, &quot;Did they intend to position an army there up on the hill?&quot; He also received multiple reports of French looting of Susa&#x27;s antiquities and taking them to France. When Reza Khan ascended the throne in 1925, his court minister, Teymourtash, suggested ending the French monopoly on excavation granted by Qajar government and appointing a Frenchman as the director of a new archaeological institute. Consequently, the French monopoly was abolished in 1927, and André Godard was appointed director of the archaeological service as a compromise. The Iranian Parliament voted on 29 April 1928, to hire Godard for five years starting from 18 November 1928. Reza Shah preferred Iranian architects. When his favorite daughter, Princess Shams, wanted a garden, she chose a design by French architect André Godard; however, the shah&#x27;s approval was required for construction within the royal compound. Upon seeing a Latin name on the plans, Reza Shah became visibly angry. Despite assurances that Godard had lived in Iran long enough to be considered virtually Iranian, the shah tore up the plans and insisted that an Iranian architect design the garden.

Along with the modernization of the nation, Reza Shah was the ruler during the time of the Women&#x27;s Awakening (1936–1941). This movement sought the elimination of the chador from Iranian working society. Supporters held that the veil impeded physical exercise and the ability of women to enter society and contribute to the progress of the nation. This move met opposition from the Mullahs from the religious establishment. The unveiling issue and the Women&#x27;s Awakening are linked to the Marriage Law of 1931 and the Second Congress of Eastern Women in Tehran in 1932. Reza Shah was the first Iranian Monarch in 1400 years who paid respect to the Jews by praying in the synagogue when visiting the Jewish community of Isfahan; an act that boosted the self-esteem of the Iranian Jews and made Reza Shah their second most respected Iranian leader after Cyrus the Great. Reza Shah&#x27;s reforms opened new occupations to Jews and allowed them to leave the ghetto. Contradicting this are claims that he was behind anti-Jewish incidents in parts of Tehran during September 1922. He forbade photographing aspects of Iran he considered backwards such as camels, and he banned clerical dress and chadors in favor of Western dress.

===Parliament and ministers===

Parliamentary elections during the Shah&#x27;s reign were not democratic. The general practice was to &quot;draw up, with the help of the police chief, a list of parliamentary candidates for the interior minister. The interior minister then passed the same names onto the provincial governor-general. ... [who] handed down the list to the supervisory electoral councils that were packed by the Interior Ministry to oversee the ballots. Parliament ceased to be a meaningful institution, and instead became a decorative garb covering the nakedness of military rule.&quot;

Reza Shah discredited and eliminated a number of his ministers. His minister of Imperial Court, Abdolhossein Teymourtash, was accused and convicted of corruption, bribery, misuse of foreign currency regulations, and plans to overthrow the Shah. He was removed as the minister of court in 1932 and died under suspicious circumstances while in prison in September 1933. The minister of finance, Prince Firouz Nosrat-ed-Dowleh III, who played an important role in the first three years of his reign, was convicted on similar charges in May 1930, and also died in prison, in January 1938. Ali-Akbar Davar, his minister of justice, was suspected of similar charges and committed suicide in February 1937. The elimination of these ministers &quot;deprived&quot; Iran &quot;of her most dynamic figures ... and the burden of government fell heavily on Reza Shah&quot; according to historian Cyrus Ghani.

Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Hekmat funded the construction of key cultural and educational sites in Iran, including the University of Tehran, the Ancient Iran Museum (later the Iran National Museum), and the tombs of Ferdowsi, Hafez, and Saadi. His account of building the university and the medical school’s first dissection hall reveals the cultural challenges faced during Iran&#x27;s modernization. In a 1934 ministerial meeting, Hekmat pointed out that Tehran lacked a university. Reza Shah immediately tasked Hekmat with establishing one, allocating a budget of 250,000 Toman. Before, Shah had ordered ten students annually to study in Europe and the United States. Reza Shah advised against sending more students abroad, suggesting the establishment of a university in Tehran instead. From 1937, the University of Tehran admitted both men and women to study law, medicine, pharmacology, and literature.

Ali Asghar Hekmat enlisted Godard to design the University of Tehran, using the 200,000-square-meter Jalaliyah Garden for the project. In 1935, the Ebne Sina Medical School opened first, adorned with calligraphy from Nezami’s poems praising knowledge. Despite strong opposition from conservative clerics who opposed the dissection hall, efforts by figures like Hekmat ensured the school’s opening. Dr. Bakhtiar, a surgeon and deputy, had to discreetly visit hospitals, retrieve corpses, load them into his car, and transport them to the dissection hall.

===Replacement of &quot;Persia&quot; with &quot;Iran&quot;===

In the Western world, Persia (or its cognates) was historically the common name for Iran. In 1935, Reza Shah asked foreign delegates and League of Nations to use the term Iran (&quot;Land of the Aryans&quot;), the endonym of the country, used by its native people, in formal correspondence. Since then, the use of the word &quot;Iran&quot; has become more common in the Western world. This also changed the usage of the names for the Iranian nationality, and the common adjective for citizens of Iran changed from Persian to Iranian. In 1959, the government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Reza Shah Pahlavi&#x27;s son and successor, announced that both &quot;Persia&quot; and &quot;Iran&quot; could officially be used interchangeably, nonetheless use of &quot;Iran&quot; continued to supplant &quot;Persia&quot;, especially in the West. Although the predominant and official language of the country was the Persian language, many did not consider themselves ethnic Persians, whereas &quot;Iranians&quot; made for a much more neutral and unifying reference to all the ethnic groups of Iran; furthermore, &quot;Persia&quot; (locally known as Pars) was geographically confusing at times as it was also the name of one of Iran&#x27;s significant cultural provinces. Although internally the country had been referred to as Iran throughout much of its history since the Sasanian Empire, many countries including the English-speaking world knew the country as Persia, largely a legacy of the Ancient Greeks name for the Achaemenid Empire.

===Support and opposition===
Support for the Shah came principally from three sources. The central &quot;pillar&quot; was the military, where the shah had begun his career. The annual defense budget of Iran &quot;increased more than fivefold from 1926 to 1941.&quot; Officers were paid more than other salaried employees. The new modern and expanded state bureaucracy of Iran was another source of support. Its ten civilian ministries employed 90,000 full-time government workers. Patronage controlled by the Shah&#x27;s royal court served as the third &quot;pillar&quot;. This was financed by the Shah&#x27;s considerable personal wealth which had been built up by forced sales and confiscations of estates, making him &quot;the richest man in Iran&quot;. On his abdication Reza Shah &quot;left to his heir a bank account of some three million pounds sterling and estates totaling over 3 million acres&quot;.

Although the landed aristocracy lost most of their influence during Reza Shah&#x27;s reign, his regime aroused opposition not from them or the gentry but from Iran&#x27;s: &quot;tribes, the clergy, and the young generation of the new intelligentsia. The tribes bore the brunt of the new order.&quot; Among the tribes forcibly settled where the Bakhtiari, Qashqai, Lur, Kurd, Baluchi. According to Sandra Mackey, the settling &quot;shattered tribal economic and undermined the traditional social structure. ... people and herds, ill adapted to a sedentary lifestyle and dependent for hygiene and health on moving campsites from time to time, died in terrible numbers. None have forgotten.&quot;

===Clash with the clergy===
As his reign became more secure, Reza Shah clashed with Iran&#x27;s clergy and devout Muslims on many issues. In March 1928, he violated the sanctuary of Qom&#x27;s Fatima Masumeh Shrine to beat a cleric who had angrily admonished Reza Shah&#x27;s wife for temporarily exposing her face a day earlier while on pilgrimage to Qom. In December of that year he instituted a law requiring everyone (except Shia jurisconsults who had passed a special qualifying examination) to wear Western clothes. This angered devout Muslims because it included a hat with a brim which prevented the devout from touching their foreheads on the ground during salat as required by Islamic law. The Shah also encouraged women to discard hijab. He announced that female teachers could no longer come to school with head coverings. One of his daughters reviewed a girls&#x27; athletic event with an uncovered head.Reza Shah confiscated some religious madrasas from clerics. Esmail Meraat, the Minister of Culture, converted the Marvi Madrasa into a new art college (Honar Kadeh) in Tehran, where Andre Godard and Maxime Siroux were among the teachers; however, the second Pahlavi king, Mohammad Reza Shah, later relocated the art college to the basement of the faculty of engineering at the University of Tehran, returning the madrasa to the clerics.
The devout were also angered by policies that allowed mixing of the sexes. Women were allowed to study in the colleges of law and medicine, and in 1934 a law set heavy fines for cinemas, restaurant, and hotels that did not open their doors to both sexes. Doctors were permitted to dissect human bodies, in defiance of the Quranic ban on necropsy (the Shah even forced his cabinet members to &quot;accompany him to the university&#x27;s pathology lab to view two cadavers in a vat&quot;). He restricted public mourning observances to one day, banned self-flagellation during Ashura, and required mosques to use chairs instead of the traditional sitting on the floors of mosques. By the mid-1930s, Reza Shah&#x27;s rule had caused intense dissatisfaction of the Shia clergy throughout Iran. In 1935, a rebellion erupted in the Imam Reza Shrine in Mashhad. Responding to a cleric who denounced the Shah&#x27;s &quot;heretical&quot; innovations, corruption and heavy consumer taxes, many bazaaris and villagers took refuge in the shrine, chanting slogans such as &quot;The Shah is a new Yezid&quot;. For four full days local police and army refused to violate the shrine. The standoff was ended when troops from Iranian Azerbaijan arrived and broke into the shrine, killing dozens and injuring hundreds, and marking a final rupture between the clergy and the Shah. Some of the Mashed clergy even left their jobs, such as the Keeper of the Keys of the shrine Hassan Mazloumi, later named Barjesteh, who stated he did not want to listen to the orders of a dog. From 1925 to 1941, enrollment of &quot;theology students in the traditional madresehs&quot;—roughly the equivalent in age level of secondary schools—declined from 5984 to 785. The Shah also intensified his controversial changes following the incident with the &quot;Kashf-e hijab&quot; decree, banning the chador and ordering all citizens, rich and poor, to bring their wives to public functions without head coverings.

===Foreign affairs and influence===
Reza Shah initiated change in foreign affairs as well. He worked to balance British influence with other foreigners and generally to diminish foreign influence in Iran. One of the first acts of the new government after the 1921 entrance into Tehran was to tear up the treaty with the Soviet Union. In 1934, he made an official state visit to Turkey and met Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. During their meeting Reza Shah spoke in Azerbaijani, and Atatürk in Turkish. In 1931, Reza Shah refused to allow Imperial Airways to fly in Persian airspace, instead giving the concession to German-owned Lufthansa Airlines. The next year, 1932, he surprised the British by unilaterally canceling the oil concession awarded to William Knox D&#x27;Arcy (and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), which was slated to expire in 1961. The concession granted Persia 16% of the net profits from APOC oil operations. The Shah wanted 21%. The British took the dispute before the League of Nations. Before a decision was made by the League, the company and Iran compromised and a new concession was signed on 26 April 1933.

Reza Shah previously hired American consultants to develop and implement Western-style financial and administrative systems. Among them was U.S. economist Arthur Millspaugh, who acted as the nation&#x27;s finance minister. Reza Shah also purchased ships from Italy and hired Italians to teach his troops the intricacies of naval warfare. He also imported hundreds of German technicians and advisors for various projects. Mindful of Persia&#x27;s long period of subservience to British and Russian authority, Reza Shah was careful to avoid giving any one foreign nation too much control. He also insisted that foreign advisors be employed by the Persian government, so that they would not be answerable to foreign powers. This was based upon his experience with Anglo-Persian, which was owned and operated by the British government. In his campaign against foreign influence, he annulled the 19th-century capitulations to Europeans in 1928. Under these, Europeans in Iran had enjoyed the privilege of being subject to their own consular courts rather than to the Iranian judiciary. The right to print money was moved from the British Imperial Bank to his National Bank of Iran (Bank-i Melli Iran), as was the administration of the telegraph system, from the Indo-European Telegraph Company to the Iranian government, in addition to the collection of customs by Belgian officials. He eventually fired Millspaugh, and prohibited foreigners from administering schools, owning land or traveling in the provinces without police permission.
Not all observers agree that the Shah minimized foreign influence. Reza Shah built a 1392 km-long rail line connecting the Persian Gulf with the Caspian Sea, using foreign technicians from countries with no historic interest in Iran—principally Germany, Scandinavia, and the United States—and not using foreign loans. According to Makki Hossein, this north–south railway line was uneconomical, only serving the British, who had a military presence in the south of Iran and desired the ability to transfer their troops north to Russia, as part of their strategic defence plan. Instead, the Shah&#x27;s government should have developed what critics believe was an economically justifiable east–west railway system. In the decades that followed and continuing into the present, north-south transit is considered far more economically vital in comparison to west–east transit.

On 21 March 1935, Reza Shah issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term &quot;Iran&quot; in formal correspondence, as &quot;Persia&quot; is a term used for a country identified as &quot;Iran&quot; in the Persian language. It was attributed more to the Iranian people than others, as &quot;Iran&quot; means &quot;Land of the Aryans&quot;. This wisdom of this decision continues to be debated. Tired of the opportunistic policies of both Britain and the Soviet Union, the Shah circumscribed contacts with foreign embassies. Relations with the Soviet Union had already deteriorated because of that country&#x27;s commercial policies, which in the 1920s and 1930s adversely affected Iran. In 1932, the Shah cancelled the agreement under which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company produced and exported Iran&#x27;s oil. Although a new and improved agreement was eventually signed, it did not satisfy Iran&#x27;s demands and left bad feeling on both sides. Unlike the British and Soviets, Germany was always in good terms with Iran. On the eve of World War II, Germany was Iran&#x27;s largest ally and trading partner. The Germans agreed to give the Shah the steel factory he coveted and considered a &quot;sine qua non&quot; of progress and modernity. They began to form a stronger alliance as Iran started helping the Axis forces and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s cabinet declared Iranians to be immune to the Nuremberg Laws, as they were considered to be the only people besides Germans to be &quot;pure Aryans&quot;. In 1939, Hitler provided Iran with their German Scientific Library, which contained over 7,500 books on eugenics &quot;to convince the Persians of the kinship between Germans and the Persians, the modern Aryans and the ancient Aryans&quot;. In various pro-Nazi publications, lectures, speeches, and ceremonies, parallels were drawn between the Shah and Hitler, and praises were given to the charisma and the virtue of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;.

Reza Shah&#x27;s foreign policy, which had consisted largely on playing the Soviet Union off against the United Kingdom, failed when the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, resulted in those two powers becoming sudden allies in the fight against the Axis powers. Seeking to scold this new Axis ally, and to guarantee the continued supply for United Kingdom and in order to secure a route of supply to provide Soviet forces with war material, the two allies jointly launched a surprise invasion in August 1941. Caught off guard, out gunned, and diplomatically isolated, Reza Shah was defeated by the Anglo-Soviet invasion, ordering his forces to surrender to prevent the world war from reaching Iran, and was forced to abdicate the throne in favor of his son. Reza Shah then was banished into exile while Iran would remain under Allied occupation until 1946.

===Later years of reign===
The Shah&#x27;s reign is sometimes divided into periods. All the efforts of Reza Shah&#x27;s reign were either completed or conceived in the 1925–1938 period. Abdolhossein Teymourtash assisted by Farman Farma, Ali-Akbar Davar and a large number of modern educated Iranians, proved adept at masterminding the implementation of many reforms demanded since the failed constitutional revolution of 1905–1911. The preservation and promotion of the country&#x27;s historic heritage, the provision of public education, construction of a national railway, abolition of capitulation agreements, and the establishment of a national bank had all been advocated by intellectuals since the tumult of the constitutional revolution. The later years of his reign were dedicated to institutionalizing the educational system of Iran and also to the industrialization of the country. He knew that the system of the constitutional monarchy in Iran after him had to stand on a solid basis of the collective participation of all Iranians, and that it was indispensable to create educational centers all over Iran. Reza Shah attempted to forge a regional alliance with Iran&#x27;s Middle Eastern neighbors, particularly Turkey. The death of Ataturk in 1938, followed by the start of World War II shortly thereafter, prevented these projects from being realized.

The parliament assented to his decrees, the free press was suppressed, and the swift incarceration of political leaders like Mossadegh, the murder of others such as Teymourtash, Sardar Asad, Firouz, Modarres, Arbab Keikhosro and the suicide of Davar, ensured that any progress towards democratization was stillborn and organized opposition to the Shah, impossible. Reza Shah treated the urban middle class, the managers, and technocrats with an iron fist; as a result his state-owned industries remained underproductive and inefficient. The bureaucracy fell apart, since officials preferred sycophancy, when anyone could be whisked away to prison for even the whiff of disobeying his whims. He confiscated land from the Qajars and from his rivals and into his own estates. The corruption continued under his rule and even became institutionalized. Progress toward modernization was spotty and isolated as it could only take place with Shah&#x27;s approval. Eventually, the Shah became totally dependent on the military and secret police to retain power; in return, these state organs regularly received funding up to 50 percent of available public revenue to ensure their loyalty.

===World War II and forced abdication===
In August 1941 the Allied powers (United Kingdom and the Soviet Union) invaded and occupied neutral Iran by a massive air, land, and naval assault without a declaration of war. By 28–29 August, the Iranian military situation was in complete chaos. The Allies had complete control over the skies of Iran, and large sections of the country were in their hands. Major Iranian cities (such as Tehran) were suffering repeated air raids. In Tehran itself, the casualties had been light, but the Soviet Air Force dropped leaflets over city, warning the population of an upcoming massive bombing raid and urging them to surrender before they suffered imminent destruction. Tehran&#x27;s water and food supply had faced shortages, and soldiers fled in fear of the Soviets killing them upon capture. Faced with total collapse, the royal family (except the Shah and the Crown Prince) fled to Isfahan. The collapse of the army that Reza Shah had spent so much time and effort creating was humiliating. Many Iranian commanders behaved incompetently, others secretly sympathized with the British and sabotaged Iranian resistance. The army generals met in secret to discuss surrender options. When the Shah learned of the generals&#x27; actions, he beat armed forces chief General Ahmad Nakhjavan with a cane and physically stripped him of his rank. Nakhjavan was nearly shot by the Shah on the spot, but at the insistence of the Crown Prince, he was sent to prison instead.
The Shah ordered pro-British Prime Minister Ali Mansur, whom he blamed for demoralising the military, to resign, replacing him with former prime minister Mohammad Ali Foroughi. Within days, Reza Shah ordered the military to cease resistance and entered into negotiations with the British and Soviets. Foroughi was disobliged towards Reza Shah, having been previously forced into retirement years earlier for political reasons with his daughter&#x27;s father in-law being executed by firing squad. When he entered into negotiations with the British, instead of negotiating a favorable settlement, Foroughi implied that both he and the Iranian people wanted to be &quot;liberated&quot; from the Shah&#x27;s rule. The British and Foroughi agreed that for the Allies to withdraw, Iran would have to expel the German minister and his staff should leave Tehran; the German, Italian, Hungarian and Romanian legations would be closed; and all remaining German nationals (including all families) would be handed over to the British and Soviet authorities. The last order would mean almost certain imprisonment or, in the case of those handed to the Soviets, possible death. Reza Shah stalled on the last demand, choosing instead to secretly evacuate German nationals from the country. By 18 September, most of the German nationals had escaped via the Turkish border.

In response to the Shah&#x27;s defiance, the Red Army on 16 September moved to occupy Tehran. Fearing execution by the Communists, many people (especially the wealthy) fled the city. Reza Shah, in a letter handwritten by Foroughi, announced his abdication, as the Soviets entered the city on 17 September. The British wanted to restore the Qajar dynasty to power, but the heir to Ahmad Shah Qajar since that last Qajar Shah&#x27;s death in 1930, Hamid Hassan Mirza, was a British subject who spoke no Persian. Instead (with the help of Foroughi), Crown Prince Mohammad Reza Pahlavi took the oath to become the Shah of Iran.

The British left the Shah a face-saving way out: &quot;Would His Highness kindly abdicate in favor of his son, the heir to the throne? We have a high opinion of him and will ensure his position. But His Highness should not think there is any other solution.&quot; The Anglo-Soviet invasion was instigated in response to Reza for having denied the request to remove the German residents, who could threaten the Abadan refinery. Reza Shah further refused the Allies&#x27; requests to expel German nationals residing in Iran and denied the use of the railway to the Allies. According to the British embassy reports from Tehran in 1940, the total number of German citizens in Iran from technicians to spies was no more than one thousand. Because of its strategic importance to the Allies, Iran was subsequently called &quot;The Bridge of Victory&quot; by Winston Churchill. Reza Shah was forced by the invading British to abdicate in favor of his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who replaced his father as Shah on the throne on 16 September 1941.

===Critics and defenders===
Reza Shah&#x27;s main critics were the &quot;new intelligentsia&quot;, often educated in Europe, for whom the Shah &quot;was not a state-builder but an &#x27;oriental despot&#x27; ... not a reformer but a plutocrat strengthening the landed upper class; not a real nationalist but a jack-booted Cossack trained by the Tsarists and brought to power by British imperialists.&quot; His defenders included Ahmad Kasravi, a contemporary intellectual and historian of constitutional movement, who had strongly criticized participation of Reza Shah in the 1909 siege of Tabriz. When he accepted the unpleasant responsibility of acting as defense attorney for a group of officers accused of torturing political prisoners, he stated: &quot;Our young intellectuals cannot possibly understand and cannot judge the reign of Reza Shah. They cannot because they were too young to remember the chaotic and desperate conditions out of which arose the autocrat named Reza Shah.&quot;

Clarmont Skrine, a British civil servant who accompanied Reza Shah on his 1941 journey to British Mauritius, writes in his book &quot;World War in Iran&quot;: &quot;Reza Shah Pahlavi, posthumously entitled &#x27;The Great&#x27; in the annals of his country was indeed, if not the greatest, at any rate one of the strongest and ablest men Iran has produced in all the two and a half milleniums of her history.&quot;

==Death==

Like his son after him, Reza Shah died in exile. After the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Iran on 25 August 1941, the British offered to keep his family in power if Reza Shah agreed to a life of exile. Reza Shah abdicated and the British forces quickly took him and his children to Mauritius, where he lived at &quot;Château Val Ory&quot; on Bois-Cheri Road in the village of Moka. The Chateau Val Ory is still an Iranian property, albeit in a decrepitated state with the Iranian government refusing to sell it to the Mauritian government. Subsequently, he was sent to Durban and then to a house at 41 Young Avenue in the Parktown neighborhood of Johannesburg, South Africa, where he died at the age of sixty-six on 26 July 1944 of a heart ailment about which he had been complaining for many years. His personal doctor had boosted the King&#x27;s morale in exile by telling him that he was suffering from chronic indigestion and not heart ailment. He lived on a diet of plain rice and boiled chicken in the last years of his life. 

After his death, his body was carried to Egypt, where it was embalmed and kept at the royal Al-Rifa&#x27;i Mosque in Cairo (also the future burial place of his son, the exiled Mohammad Reza Pahlavi). In May 1950, the remains were flown back to Iran where the embalming was removed, and buried in a mausoleum built in his honor in the town of Ray, in the southern suburbs of the capital, Tehran. 
The Iranian parliament (Majlis) later designated the title &quot;the Great&quot; to be added to his name. There were reports that on 14 January 1979, shortly before the Iranian Revolution, the remains were moved back to Egypt and buried in the Al-Rifa&#x27;i Mosque in Cairo. In a 2015 documentary &quot;From Tehran to Cairo&quot;, his daughter-in-law, Empress Farah, claimed that the remains of the late Reza Shah remain in the town of Ray. After the 1979 revolution and during the period of the Interim Government of Iran, Iran faced a series of rampages at the hand of an extremist mob led by the cleric Sadeq Khalkhali. During this rampage, happening all over the nation, any construction depicting or even citing the name of the Shah and his family was destroyed. This included the destruction of Reza Shah&#x27;s mausoleum but were unable to find his dead body. In 2018, a mummified body believed to be Reza Shah&#x27;s was found in the vicinity of his former mausoleum site in Tehran. An official said that the body belonged to Reza Shah and was buried in the same area.

==Amendments and foundations==
Under Reza Shah&#x27;s reign, a number of new concepts were introduced between 1923 and 1941. Some of these significant changes, achievements, concepts, and laws included:
* Successful suppression of separatist movements and reunification of Iran under a powerful central government.
* Foundation of the first judicial system of Iran.
* Foundation of the first national health care system and public hospitals across the country.
* Reestablishment of Iranian Gendarmerie and Shahrbani in order to enforce law and order.

<doc id="250815" wikidata="Q583664" url="?curid=250815" title="Selectron tube">
<text>The Selectron was an early form of digital computer memory developed by Jan A. Rajchman and his group at the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) under the direction of Vladimir K. Zworykin. It was a vacuum tube that stored digital data as electrostatic charges using technology similar to the Williams tube storage device. The team was never able to produce a commercially viable form of Selectron before magnetic-core memory became almost universal.

== Development ==
Development of Selectron started in 1946 at the behest of John von Neumann of the Institute for Advanced Study, who was in the midst of designing the IAS machine and was looking for a new form of high-speed memory.

RCA&#x27;s original design concept had a capacity of 4096 bits, with a planned production of 200 by the end of 1946. They found the device to be much more difficult to build than expected, and they were still not available by the middle of 1948. As development dragged on, the IAS machine was forced to switch to Williams tubes for storage, and the primary customer for Selectron disappeared. RCA lost interest in the design and assigned its engineers to improve televisions 

A contract from the US Air Force led to a re-examination of the device in a 256-bit form. Rand Corporation took advantage of this project to switch their own IAS machine, the JOHNNIAC, to this new version of the Selectron, using 80 of them to provide 512 40-bit words of main memory. They signed a development contract with RCA to produce enough tubes for their machine at a projected cost of $500 per tube ($ in ).

Around this time IBM expressed an interest in the Selectron as well, but this did not lead to additional production. As a result, RCA assigned their engineers to color television development, and put the Selectron in the hands of &quot;the mothers-in-law of two deserving employees (the Chairman of the Board and the President).&quot;

Both the Selectron and the Williams tube were superseded in the market by the compact and cost-effective magnetic-core memory, in the early 1950s. The JOHNNIAC developers had decided to switch to core even before the first Selectron-based version had been completed.

==Principle of operation==

===Electrostatic storage===
The Williams tube was an example of a general class of cathode-ray tube (CRT) devices known as storage tubes.

The primary function of a conventional CRT is to display an image by lighting phosphor using a beam of electrons fired at it from an electron gun at the back of the tube. The target point of the beam is steered around the front of the tube though the use of deflection magnets or electrostatic plates.

Storage tubes were based on CRTs, sometimes unmodified. They relied on two normally undesirable principles of phosphor used in the tubes. One was that when electrons from the CRT&#x27;s electron gun struck the phosphor to light it, some of the electrons &quot;stuck&quot; to the tube and caused a localized static electric charge to build up. This charge opposed any future electrons flowing into that area from the gun, and caused differences in brightness. The second was that the phosphor, like many materials, also released new electrons when struck by an electron beam, a process known as secondary emission.

Secondary emission had the useful feature that the rate of electron release was significantly non-linear. When a voltage was applied that crossed a certain threshold, the rate of emission increased dramatically. This caused the lit spot to rapidly decay, which also caused any stuck electrons to be released as well. Visual systems used this process to erase the display, causing any stored pattern to rapidly fade. For computer uses it was the rapid release of the stuck charge that allowed it to be used for storage.

In the Williams tube, the electron gun at the back of an otherwise typical CRT is used to deposit a series of small patterns representing a 1 or 0 on the phosphor in a grid representing memory addresses. To read the display, the beam scanned the tube again, this time set to a voltage very close to that of the secondary emission threshold. The patterns were selected to bias the tube very slightly positive or negative. When the stored static electricity was added to the voltage of the beam, the total voltage either crossed the secondary emission threshold or didn&#x27;t. If it crossed the threshold, a burst of electrons was released as the dot decayed. This burst was read capacitively on a metal plate placed just in front of the display side of the tube.

There were four general classes of storage tubes; the &quot;surface redistribution type&quot; represented by the Williams tube, the &quot;barrier grid&quot; system, which was unsuccessfully commercialized by RCA as the Radechon tube, the &quot;sticking potential&quot; type which was not used commercially, and the &quot;holding beam&quot; concept, of which the Selectron is a specific example.

===Holding beam concept===
In the most basic implementation, the holding beam tube uses three electron guns; one for writing, one for reading, and a third &quot;holding gun&quot; that maintains the pattern. The general operation is very similar to the Williams tube in concept. The main difference was the holding gun, which fired continually and unfocussed so it covered the entire storage area on the phosphor. This caused the phosphor to be continually charged to a selected voltage, somewhat below that of the secondary emission threshold.

Writing was accomplished by firing the writing gun at low voltage in a fashion similar to the Williams tube, adding a further voltage to the phosphor. Thus the storage pattern was the slight difference between two voltages stored on the tube, typically only a few tens of volts different. In comparison, the Williams tube used much higher voltages, producing a pattern that could only be stored for a short period before it decayed below readability.

Reading was accomplished by scanning the reading gun across the storage area. This gun was set to a voltage that would cross the secondary emission threshold for the entire display. If the scanned area held the holding gun potential a certain number of electrons would be released, if it held the writing gun potential the number would be higher. The electrons were read on a grid of fine wires placed behind the display, making the system entirely self-contained. In contrast, the Williams tube&#x27;s read plate was in front of the tube, and required continual mechanical adjustment to work properly. The grid also had the advantage of breaking the display into individual spots without requiring the tight focus of the Williams system.

General operation was the same as the Williams system, but the holding concept had two major advantages. One was that it operated at much lower voltage differences and was thus able to safely store data for a longer period of time. The other was that the same deflection magnet drivers could be sent to several electron guns to produce a single larger device with no increase in complexity of the electronics.

== Design ==
The Selectron further modified the basic holding gun concept through the use of individual metal eyelets that were used to store additional charge in a more predictable and long-lasting fashion.

Unlike a CRT where the electron gun is a single point source consisting of a filament and single charged accelerator, in the Selectron the &quot;gun&quot; is a plate and the accelerator is a grid of wires (thus borrowing some design notes from the barrier-grid tube). Switching circuits allow voltages to be applied to the wires to turn them on or off. When the gun fires through the eyelets, it is slightly defocussed. Some of the electrons strike the eyelet and deposit a charge on it.

The original 4096-bit Selectron was a by vacuum tube configured as 1024 by 4 bits. It had an indirectly heated cathode running up the middle, surrounded by two separate sets of wires — one radial, one axial — forming a cylindrical grid array, and finally a dielectric storage material coating on the inside of four segments of an enclosing metal cylinder, called the &quot;signal plates&quot;. The bits were stored as discrete regions of charge on the smooth surfaces of the signal plates.

The two sets of orthogonal grid wires were normally &quot;biased&quot; slightly positive, so that the electrons from the cathode were accelerated through the grid to reach the dielectric. The continuous flow of electrons allowed the stored charge to be continuously regenerated by the secondary emission of electrons. To select a bit to be read from or written to, all but two adjacent wires on each of the two grids were biased negative, allowing current to flow to the dielectric at one location only.

In this respect, the Selectron works in the opposite sense of the Williams tube. In the Williams tube, the beam is continually scanning in a read/write cycle which is also used to regenerate data. In contrast, the Selectron is almost always regenerating the entire tube, only breaking this periodically to do actual reads and writes. This not only made operation faster due to the lack of required pauses but also meant the data was much more reliable as it was constantly refreshed. 

Writing was accomplished by selecting a bit, as above, and then sending a pulse of potential, either positive or negative, to the signal plate. With a bit selected, electrons would be pulled onto (with a positive potential) or pushed from (negative potential) the dielectric. When the bias on the grid was dropped, the electrons were trapped on the dielectric as a spot of static electricity.

To read from the device, a bit location was selected and a pulse sent from the cathode. If the dielectric for that bit contained a charge, the electrons would be pushed off the dielectric and read as a brief pulse of current in the signal plate. No such pulse meant that the dielectric must not have held a charge.

The smaller capacity 256-bit (128 by 2 bits) &quot;production&quot; device was in a similar vacuum-tube envelope. It was built with two storage arrays of discrete &quot;eyelets&quot; on a rectangular plate, separated by a row of eight cathodes. The pin count was reduced from 44 for the 4096-bit device down to 31 pins and two coaxial signal output connectors. This version included visible green phosphors in each eyelet so that the bit status could also be read by eye.

<text>William Kingdon Clifford (4 May 18453 March 1879) was a British mathematician and philosopher. Building on the work of Hermann Grassmann, he introduced what is now termed geometric algebra, a special case of the Clifford algebra named in his honour. The operations of geometric algebra have the effect of mirroring, rotating, translating, and mapping the geometric objects that are being modelled to new positions. Clifford algebras in general and geometric algebra in particular have been of ever increasing importance to mathematical physics, geometry, and computing. Clifford was the first to suggest that gravitation might be a manifestation of an underlying geometry. In his philosophical writings he coined the expression &quot;mind-stuff&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Exeter, William Clifford was educated at Doctor Templeton&#x27;s Academy on Bedford Circus and showed great promise at school. He went on to King&#x27;s College London (at age 15) and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected fellow in 1868, after being Second Wrangler in 1867 and second Smith&#x27;s prizeman. In 1870, he was part of an expedition to Italy to observe the solar eclipse of 22 December 1870. During that voyage he survived a shipwreck along the Sicilian coast.

In 1871, he was appointed professor of mathematics and mechanics at University College London, and in 1874 became a fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a member of the London Mathematical Society and the Metaphysical Society.

Clifford married Lucy Lane on 7 April 1875, with whom he had two children. Clifford enjoyed entertaining children and wrote a collection of fairy stories, &quot;The Little People&quot;.

===Death and legacy===
In 1876, Clifford suffered a breakdown, probably brought on by overwork. He taught and administered by day, and wrote by night. A half-year holiday in Algeria and Spain allowed him to resume his duties for 18 months, after which he collapsed again. He went to the island of Madeira to recover, but died there of tuberculosis after a few months, leaving a widow with two children.

Clifford and his wife are buried in London&#x27;s Highgate Cemetery, near the graves of George Eliot and Herbert Spencer, just north of the grave of Karl Marx.

The academic journal &quot;Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras&quot; publishes on Clifford&#x27;s legacy in kinematics and abstract algebra.

== Mathematics ==

The discovery of non-Euclidean geometry opened new possibilities in geometry in Clifford&#x27;s era. The field of intrinsic differential geometry was born, with the concept of curvature broadly applied to space itself as well as to curved lines and surfaces. Clifford was very much impressed by Bernhard Riemann’s 1854 essay &quot;On the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry&quot;. In 1870, he reported to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on the curved space concepts of Riemann, and included speculation on the bending of space by gravity. Clifford&#x27;s translation of Riemann&#x27;s paper was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1873. His report at Cambridge, &quot;&quot;, was published in 1876, anticipating Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity by 40 years. Clifford elaborated elliptic space geometry as a non-Euclidean metric space. Equidistant curves in elliptic space are now said to be Clifford parallels.
Clifford&#x27;s contemporaries considered him acute and original, witty and warm. He often worked late into the night, which may have hastened his death. He published papers on a range of topics including algebraic forms and projective geometry and the textbook &quot;Elements of Dynamic&quot;. His application of graph theory to invariant theory was followed up by William Spottiswoode and Alfred Kempe.

===Algebras===
In 1878, Clifford published a seminal work, building on Grassmann&#x27;s extensive algebra. He had succeeded in unifying the quaternions, developed by William Rowan Hamilton, with Grassmann&#x27;s &quot;outer product&quot; (aka the &quot;exterior product&quot;). He understood the geometric nature of Grassmann&#x27;s creation, and that the quaternions fit cleanly into the algebra Grassmann had developed. The versors in quaternions facilitate representation of rotation. Clifford laid the foundation for a geometric product, composed of the sum of the inner product and Grassmann&#x27;s outer product. The geometric product was eventually formalized by the Hungarian mathematician Marcel Riesz. The inner product equips geometric algebra with a metric, fully incorporating distance and angle relationships for lines, planes, and volumes, while the outer product gives those planes and volumes vector-like properties, including a directional bias.

Combining the two brought the operation of division into play. This greatly expanded our qualitative understanding of how objects interact in space. Crucially, it also provided the means for quantitatively calculating the spatial consequences of those interactions. The resulting geometric algebra, as he called it, eventually realized the long sought goal of creating an algebra that mirrors the movements and projections of objects in 3-dimensional space.

Moreover, Clifford&#x27;s algebraic schema extends to higher dimensions. The algebraic operations have the same symbolic form as they do in 2 or 3-dimensions. The importance of general Clifford algebras has grown over time, while their isomorphism classes - as real algebras - have been identified in other mathematical systems beyond simply the quaternions.

The realms of real analysis and complex analysis have been expanded through the algebra H of quaternions, thanks to its notion of a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Quaternion versors, which inhabit this 3-sphere, provide a representation of the rotation group SO(3). Clifford noted that Hamilton&#x27;s biquaternions were a tensor product formula_1 of known algebras, and proposed instead two other tensor products of H: Clifford argued that the &quot;scalars&quot; taken from the complex numbers C might instead be taken from split-complex numbers D or from the dual numbers N. In terms of tensor products, formula_2 produces split-biquaternions, while formula_3 forms dual quaternions. The algebra of dual quaternions is used to express screw displacement, a common mapping in kinematics.

==Philosophy==

As a philosopher, Clifford&#x27;s name is chiefly associated with two phrases of his coining, &quot;mind-stuff&quot; and the &quot;tribal self&quot;. The former symbolizes his metaphysical conception, suggested to him by his reading of Baruch Spinoza, which Clifford (1878) defined as follows:

Regarding Clifford&#x27;s concept, Sir Frederick Pollock wrote:

&quot;Tribal self&quot;, on the other hand, gives the key to Clifford&#x27;s ethical view, which explains conscience and the moral law by the development in each individual of a &#x27;self,&#x27; which prescribes the conduct conducive to the welfare of the &#x27;tribe.&#x27; Much of Clifford&#x27;s contemporary prominence was due to his attitude toward religion. Animated by an intense love of his conception of truth and devotion to public duty, he waged war on such ecclesiastical systems as seemed to him to favour obscurantism, and to put the claims of sect above those of human society. The alarm was greater, as theology was still unreconciled with Darwinism; and Clifford was regarded as a dangerous champion of the anti-spiritual tendencies then imputed to modern science. There has also been debate on the extent to which Clifford&#x27;s doctrine of &#x27;concomitance&#x27; or &#x27;psychophysical parallelism&#x27; influenced John Hughlings Jackson&#x27;s model of the nervous system and, through him, the work of Janet, Freud, Ribot, and Ey.

===Ethics===

In his 1877 essay, &quot;The Ethics of Belief&quot;, Clifford argues that it is immoral to believe things for which one lacks evidence. He describes a ship-owner who planned to send to sea an old and not well-built ship full of passengers. The ship-owner had doubts suggested to him that the ship might not be seaworthy: &quot;These doubts preyed upon his mind, and made him unhappy.&quot; He considered having the ship refitted even though it would be expensive. At last, &quot;he succeeded in overcoming these melancholy reflections.&quot; He watched the ship depart, &quot;with a light heart…and he got his insurance money when she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales.&quot;

Clifford argues that the ship-owner was guilty of the deaths of the passengers even though he sincerely believed the ship was sound: &quot;&quot;[H]e had no right to believe on such evidence as was before him&quot;.&quot; Moreover, he contends that even in the case where the ship successfully reaches the destination, the decision remains immoral, because the morality of the choice is defined forever once the choice is made, and actual outcome, defined by blind chance, doesn&#x27;t matter. The ship-owner would be no less guilty: his wrongdoing would never be discovered, but he still had no right to make that decision given the information available to him at the time.

Clifford famously concludes with what has come to be known as Clifford&#x27;s principle: &quot;it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.&quot;

As such, he is arguing in direct opposition to religious thinkers for whom &#x27;blind faith&#x27; (i.e. belief in things in spite of the lack of evidence for them) was a virtue. This paper was famously attacked by pragmatist philosopher William James in his &quot;Will to Believe&quot; lecture. Often these two works are read and published together as touchstones for the debate over evidentialism, faith, and overbelief.

==Premonition of relativity==
Though Clifford never constructed a full theory of spacetime and relativity, there are some remarkable observations he made in print that foreshadowed these modern concepts:
In his book &quot;Elements of Dynamic&quot; (1878), he introduced &quot;quasi-harmonic motion in a hyperbola&quot;. He wrote an expression for a parametrized unit hyperbola, which other authors later used as a model for relativistic velocity. Elsewhere he states:

:The geometry of rotors and motors…forms the basis of the whole modern theory of the relative rest (Static) and the relative motion (Kinematic and Kinetic) of invariable systems.

This passage makes reference to biquaternions, though Clifford made these into split-biquaternions as his independent development.
The book continues with a chapter &quot;On the bending of space&quot;, the substance of general relativity. Clifford also discussed his views in &quot;&quot; in 1876.

In 1910, William Barrett Frankland quoted the &quot;Space-Theory of Matter&quot; in his book on parallelism: &quot;The boldness of this speculation is surely unexcelled in the history of thought. Up to the present, however, it presents the appearance of an Icarian flight.&quot; Years later, after general relativity had been advanced by Albert Einstein, various authors noted that Clifford had anticipated Einstein. Hermann Weyl (1923), for instance, mentioned Clifford as one of those who, like Bernhard Riemann, anticipated the geometric ideas of relativity.

In 1940, Eric Temple Bell published &quot;The Development of Mathematics&quot;, in which he discusses the prescience of Clifford on relativity:

:Bolder even than Riemann, Clifford confessed his belief (1870) that matter is only a manifestation of curvature in a space-time manifold. This embryonic divination has been acclaimed as an anticipation of Einstein&#x27;s (1915–16) relativistic theory of the gravitational field. The actual theory, however, bears but slight resemblance to Clifford&#x27;s rather detailed creed. As a rule, those mathematical prophets who never descend to particulars make the top scores. Almost anyone can hit the side of a barn at forty yards with a charge of buckshot.

John Archibald Wheeler, during the 1960 International Congress for Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science (CLMPS) at Stanford, introduced his geometrodynamics formulation of general relativity by crediting Clifford as the initiator.

In &quot;The Natural Philosophy of Time&quot; (1961), Gerald James Whitrow recalls Clifford&#x27;s prescience, quoting him in order to describe the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric in cosmology.

Cornelius Lanczos (1970) summarizes Clifford&#x27;s premonitions:

:[He] with great ingenuity foresaw in a qualitative fashion that physical matter might be conceived as a curved ripple on a generally flat plane. Many of his ingenious hunches were later realized in Einstein&#x27;s gravitational theory. Such speculations were automatically premature and could not lead to anything constructive without an intermediate link which demanded the extension of 3-dimensional geometry to the inclusion of time. The theory of curved spaces had to be preceded by the realization that space and time form a single four-dimensional entity.

Likewise, Banesh Hoffmann (1973) writes:

:Riemann, and more specifically Clifford, conjectured that forces and matter might be local irregularities in the curvature of space, and in this they were strikingly prophetic, though for their pains they were dismissed at the time as visionaries.

In 1990, Ruth Farwell and Christopher Knee examined the record on acknowledgement of Clifford&#x27;s foresight. They conclude that &quot;it was Clifford, not Riemann, who anticipated some of the conceptual ideas of General Relativity.&quot; To explain the lack of recognition of Clifford&#x27;s prescience, they point out that he was an expert in metric geometry, and &quot;metric geometry was too challenging to orthodox epistemology to be pursued.&quot; In 1992, Farwell and Knee continued their study of Clifford and Riemann:[They] hold that once tensors had been used in the theory of general relativity, the framework existed in which a geometrical perspective in physics could be developed and allowed the challenging geometrical conceptions of Riemann and Clifford to be rediscovered.

<text>Hjalmar Petersen (January 2, 1890March 29, 1968) was an American politician who served as the 23rd Governor of Minnesota.

==Background==
Hjalmar Petersen was born in Eskildstrup, Denmark, to Lauritz and Anna Petersen, who moved with Hjalmar to Chicago, Illinois, shortly after his birth. They later moved to the Danebod in Tyler, Minnesota. Petersen attended school until the seventh grade. His career in journalism, which had begun in 1904, culminated in his purchase in 1914 of the &quot;Askov American&quot; in Askov, Minnesota, a weekly newspaper he owned for the rest of his life.

==Political career==

After serving as Askov&#x27;s village clerk and mayor, Petersen won two terms in the Minnesota House of Representatives, where he sponsored the state income-tax law and urged that tax revenues be spent on public education. Before he ran for the Minnesota Legislature he had been a member of the Republican Party. By the time he ran for office he was a member of the Farmer-Labor Party. He served in the legislature from 1931 to 1934, representing the old House District 56.

Petersen was elected the 28th Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota in 1934 and served with Governor Floyd B. Olson. He was sworn in as governor two days after Olson died of cancer on August 22, 1936. He served the remainder of Olson&#x27;s term but declined to run for governor himself in the November general election, opting instead to launch a successful bid for Railroad and Warehouse Commissioner, a position he then assumed after leaving the governorship on January 4, 1937. He later ran for governor in 1940 and 1942, losing both times to Harold Stassen.

==Personal life==
After his term as governor, he served as the president of the American Publishing Company. He was married twice, first to Rigmor C. Wosgaard in 1914 and later to Medora Grandprey in 1934. 
He died in 1968 in Columbus, Ohio.

<text>Richard Holt Hutton (2 June 1826 – 9 September 1897) was an English journalist of literature and religion.

==Life and work==

The son of Joseph Hutton, a Unitarian minister, Richard Holt Hutton was born at Leeds. His family moved to London in 1835, and he was educated at University College School and University College London, where he began a lifelong friendship with Walter Bagehot, whose works he later edited. He took his degree in 1845, and was awarded the gold medal for philosophy. Meanwhile, he had also studied for short periods at Heidelberg and Berlin, and in 1847 he entered Manchester New College with the idea of becoming a minister like his father, and studied there under James Martineau. He was not, however, called on by any church, and for some time his future was unsettled. In 1851, he married his cousin, Anne Roscoe, and became joint-editor with John Langton Sanford of the &quot;Inquirer&quot;, the main Unitarian periodical. His innovations and unconventional views about stereotyped Unitarian doctrines caused alarm, and in 1853 he resigned. His health had broken down, and he visited the West Indies, where his wife died of yellow fever.

In 1855 Hutton and Bagehot became joint editors of the &quot;National Review&quot;, a new monthly which lasted for ten years. During this time Hutton&#x27;s theological views, influenced directly by Frederick William Robertson and John Frederick Denison Maurice, gradually came closer to those of the Church of England, which he ultimately joined. He brought to his study of theology a spirituality of outlook and an aptitude for metaphysical inquiry and exposition which made his writings more attractive. In 1861 he joined Meredith Townsend as joint editor and part proprietor of the &quot;Spectator&quot;, then a well-known liberal weekly, but it did not pay. Hutton took charge of the literary side of the paper, and gradually his own articles became one of the best-known features of serious and thoughtful English journalism. The &quot;Spectator&quot;, which gradually became a prosperous property, was an outlet for his views, particularly on literary, religious and philosophical subjects, in opposition to the agnostic and rationalistic opinions then current in intellectual circles, as popularized by T. H. Huxley.

Hutton had many friends, and became one of the most respected and influential journalists of the day. In 1858 he married Eliza Roscoe, a cousin of his first wife; she died early in 1897, and Hutton&#x27;s own death followed in the same year.

Among his other publications may be mentioned &quot;Essays, Theological and Literary&quot; (1871; revised 1888), and &quot;Criticisms on Contemporary Thought and Thinkers&quot; (1894), and his opinions may be studied compendiously in the selections from his &quot;Spectator&quot; articles published in 1899 under the title of &quot;Aspects of Religious and Scientific Thought&quot;.

==Interests==

He was an original member of the Metaphysical Society (1869). He was an anti-vivisectionist, and a member of the Royal Commission (1875) on that subject, which led to the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876.

Hutton took interest in parapsychology. He was the vice president of the Society for Psychical Research in 1882.

<text>Sigmaringen is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the south of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Reutlingen, Biberach, Ravensburg, Bodensee, Constance,
Tuttlingen, and Zollernalbkreis.

==History==

The area of the district was owned by several different states historically. It was split between many minor rulers before the German Mediatisation of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. By 1806 it had become a border area between the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Kingdom of Württemberg, and the much smaller principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen embedded between them.

In 1849 Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became part of the Prussian Province of Hohenzollern (along with the principality of Hohenzollern-Hechingen). At that time it had the of Sigmaringen and Gammertingen, which were merged into the of Sigmaringen in 1925. After WWII it became part of the French-controlled state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern until 1952 when it became part of the modern of Baden-Württemberg. In 1973 the district was enlarged by adding municipalities from the neighboring districts: Saulgau, Stockach, Überlingen and Reutlingen. A roughly equal portion of the district&#x27;s area came from each of the three historic states.

==Geography==
&quot;Landkreis&quot; Sigmaringen is located in the Swabian Alb mountains, which represent an old glacially-shaped landscape formed by prehistoric moraines. In the south of the district, a line running from Bad Saulgau to Ostrach to Pfullendorf roughly marks the southernmost extent of this prehistoric moraine. This line also marks the Rhine-Danube watershed: north of this line, water drains to the Danube; south of it, water drains to Lake Constance and the Rhine. The Danube flows through the district from west to east for about 60 km. About 30 km of this distance, between Fridingen and Inzigkofen, takes the form of a dramatic canyon through the Swabian Alb. The highest points in the district are the 921 m-tall Schnaitkapf, near Schwenningen in the Alb, and the 837 m-tall Höchsten in the southeast of the district.

The district is also located in Linzgau and Upper Swabia.

==Coat of arms==
The deer in the coat of arms is the symbol of the duchy of Sigmaringen as well as that of the city of Sigmaringen. This symbol probably is from the Counts of Peutengau-Hirschberg who were the Lords of Sigmaringen until 1253. &quot;Hirsch&quot; is the German word for deer. The red color with the white bar below the deer derives from the Austrian coat of arms, as part of the district belonged to Austria historically.

<text>Frederick William Robertson (3 February 1816 – 15 August 1853), known as Robertson of Brighton, was an English divine.

==Biography==
Born in London, the first five years of his life were passed at Leith Fort, where his father, a captain in the Royal Artillery, was then resident. The military spirit entered into his blood, and throughout life he was characterised by the qualities of the ideal soldier. In 1821 Captain Robertson retired to Beverley, where the boy was educated. At the age of fourteen he spent a year at Tours, from which he returned to Scotland, and continued his education at the Edinburgh Academy and university.

In 1834 he was articled to a solicitor in Bury St Edmunds, but the uncongenial and sedentary employment soon broke down his health. He was anxious for a military career, and his name was placed upon the list of the 3rd Dragoons, then serving in India. For two years he worked hard in preparing for the army, but, by a singular conjunction of circumstances and at the sacrifice of his own natural bent to his father&#x27;s wish, he matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, just two weeks before his commission was put into his hands.
He did not find Oxford wholly congenial to his intensely earnest spirit, but he read hard, and, as he afterwards said, &quot;Plato, Aristotle, Butler, Thucydides, Sterne, Jonathan Edwards; passed like the iron atoms of the blood into my mental constitution.&quot; At the same time he made a careful study of the Bible, committing to memory the entire New Testament both in English and in Greek. The Tractarian movement had no attraction for him, although he admired some of its leaders.

He was at this time a moderate Calvinist in doctrine, and enthusiastically evangelical. Ordained in July 1840 by the bishop of Winchester, he at once entered on ministerial work in that city, and during his ministry there and under the influence of the missionaries Henry Martyn and David Brainerd, whose lives he studied, he carried devotional asceticism to an injurious length. In less than a year he was compelled to seek relaxation; and &#x27;going to Switzerland he there met and married Helen, third daughter of Sir George William Denys, Bart.

Early in 1842, after a few months&#x27; rest, he accepted a curacy in Cheltenham, which he retained for upwards of four years. The questioning spirit was first aroused in him by the disappointing fruit of evangelical doctrine which he found in Cheltenham, as well as by intimacy with men of varied reading. But, if we are to judge from his own statement in a letter from Heidelberg in 1846, the doubts which now actively assailed him had long been latent in his mind. The crisis of his mental conflict had just been passed in Tirol, and he was now beginning to let his creed grow again from the one fixed point, which nothing had availed to shift:

&quot;The one great certainty to which, in the midst of the darkest doubt, I never ceased to cling—the entire symmetry and loveliness and the unequalled nobleness of the humanity of the Son of Man.&quot;

After this mental revolution he felt unable to return to Cheltenham, but after doing duty for two months at St Ebbe&#x27;s, Oxford, he entered in August 1847 on his famous ministry at Holy Trinity Church, Brighton. Here he stepped at once into the foremost rank as a preacher, and his church was thronged with thoughtful men of all classes in society and of all shades of religious belief. His fine appearance, his flexible and sympathetic voice, his manifest. sincerity, the perfect lucidity and artistic symmetry of his address, and the brilliance with which he illustrated his points would have attracted hearers even had he had little to say. But he had much to say. He was not, indeed, a scientific theologian; but his insight into the principles of the spiritual life was unrivalled. As his biographer says, thousands found in his sermons &quot;a living source of impulse, a practical direction of thought, a key to many of the problems of theology, and above all a path to spiritual freedom.&quot; Rabbi Duncan, however, said of him, &quot;Robertson believed that Christ did something or other, which, somehow or other, had some connection or other with salvation.&quot;

Robertson&#x27;s closing years were full of sadness. His sensitive nature was subjected to extreme suffering, arising mainly from the opposition aroused by his sympathy with the revolutionary ideas of the 1848 epoch. Moreover, he was crippled by incipient disease of the brain, which at first inflicted unconquerable lassitude and depression, and latterly agonising pain. On 5 June 1853 he preached for the last time, and on 15 August he died. For the last three years of his life he had lived at 60 Montpelier Road in the Montpelier area of Brighton; between 1847 and 1850 he lived at 9 Montpelier Terrace.

Robertson&#x27;s published works include five volumes of sermons, two volumes of expository lectures, on Genesis and on the epistles to the Corinthians, a volume of miscellaneous addresses, and an &quot;Analysis of &quot;In Memoriam.&quot;&quot; See &quot;Life and Letters&quot; by Stopford A Brooke (1865).

<text>Sir Edmund Andros (6 December 1637 – 24 February 1714; also spelled &quot;Edmond&quot;) was an English colonial administrator in British America. He was the governor of the Dominion of New England during most of its three-year existence. At other times, Andros served as governor of the provinces of New York, East and West Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland.

Before serving in North America, he served as Bailiff of Guernsey. His tenure in New England was authoritarian and turbulent, as his views were decidedly pro-Anglican, a negative quality in a region home to many Puritans. His actions in New England resulted in his overthrow during the 1689 Boston revolt. He became governor of Virginia three years later.

Andros was considered a more effective governor in New York and Virginia. However, he became the enemy of prominent figures in both colonies, many of whom worked to remove him from office. Despite these enmities, he managed to negotiate several treaties of the Covenant Chain with the Iroquois, establishing a long-lived peace involving the colonies and other tribes that interacted with that confederacy. His actions and governance generally followed his instructions upon appointment to office, and he received approbation from the monarchs and governments that appointed him.

Andros was recalled to England from Virginia in 1698 and resumed the title of Bailiff of Guernsey. Although he no longer resided entirely on Guernsey, he was appointed lieutenant governor of the island and served in this position for four years. Andros died in 1714.

==Early life==

Andros was born in London on 6 December 1637. Amice Andros, his father, was Bailiff of Guernsey and a staunch supporter of Charles I. His mother was Elizabeth Stone, whose sister was a courtier to the king&#x27;s sister, Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia. Although it has been claimed that Andros was present at the surrender in 1651 of Guernsey&#x27;s Castle Cornet, the last royalist stronghold to surrender in the English Civil War, there is no firm evidence to support this. It is possible that he fled Guernsey with his mother in 1645. In 1656, he was apprenticed to his uncle, Sir Robert Stone, captain of a cavalry company. Andros then served in two winter campaigns in Denmark, including the relief of Copenhagen in 1659. As a result of these experiences he gained fluency in French, Swedish, and Dutch.

He remained a firm supporter of the Stuarts while they were in exile. Charles II, after his restoration to the throne, specifically commended the Andros family for its support.

Andros served as a courtier to Elizabeth of Bohemia from 1660 until she died in 1662. During the 1660s he served in the English army against the Dutch. He was next commissioned a major in the regiment of Sir Tobias Bridge, which was sent to Barbados in 1666. He returned to England two years later, carrying despatches and letters.

In 1671, he married Mary Craven, the daughter of Thomas Craven of Burnsall in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now North Yorkshire), the son of a cousin to the Earl of Craven, one of the queen&#x27;s closest advisors, and a friend who served as his patron for many years. In 1672 he was commissioned major.

==Governor of New York==
After his father died in 1674, Edmund Andros acquired Sausmarez Manor which added to his family&#x27;s already substantial landholdings in Guernsey that included the fief of Anneville (from 1659) and several other fiefs. He was then appointed as the Bailiff of Guernsey, succeeding his father. This appointment was for life and came with the authority to appoint a lieutenant bailiff, a position he filled with his uncle, Charles Andros, seigneur of the fief d&#x27;Anneville. This allowed Edmund Andros to travel to America. He was appointed by the James, Duke of York to be the first proprietary governor of the Province of New York. The province&#x27;s territory included the former territories of New Netherland, ceded to England by the Treaty of Westminster, including all of present-day New Jersey, the Dutch holdings on the Hudson River from New Amsterdam (renamed New York City) to Albany, as well as Long Island, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and Nantucket.

In 1664, Charles II granted James all of this territory, as well as all of the land in present-day Maine between the Kennebec and St. Croix Rivers, but with the intervening Dutch retaking of the territory, Charles issued a new patent to James. Andros arrived in New York harbor in late October and negotiated the handover of the Dutch territories with local representatives and Dutch Governor Anthony Colve, which took place on 10 November 1674. Andros agreed to confirm the existing property holdings and allow the territory&#x27;s Dutch inhabitants to maintain their Protestant religion.

===Connecticut boundary dispute===
Andros was also involved in boundary disputes with the neighboring Connecticut Colony. Dutch claims had initially extended as far east as the Connecticut River, but these claims had been ceded in the 1650 Treaty of Hartford and reduced to a boundary line east of the Hudson in 1664. York&#x27;s territorial claim did not acknowledge these, and Andros announced to Connecticut authorities his intentions to reclaim that territory (which included Connecticut&#x27;s capital, Hartford) in early 1675. Connecticut leaders pointed out the later revisions to Connecticut&#x27;s boundaries, but Andros pressed his claim, arguing that York&#x27;s grant had superseded those revisions. Andros used the outbreak of King Philip&#x27;s War in July 1675 as an excuse to go by ship to Connecticut with a small military force to establish the duke&#x27;s claim. When he arrived at Saybrook at the mouth of the river on 8 July, he found the fort there occupied by Connecticut militia, who were flying the English flag. Andros came ashore, had a brief conversation with the fort commander, read his commission, and returned to New York City. This was the full extent of Andros&#x27; attempt to claim the territory, but it would be remembered in Connecticut when later attempts were made to assert New York authority.

===King Philip&#x27;s War===
Following his Connecticut expedition, Andros traveled into Iroquois country to establish relations. He was well received and agreed to continue the Dutch practice of supplying firearms to the Iroquois. This action successfully blunted French diplomatic successes with the Iroquois. It also led to charges in New England that Andros provided arms to Indians allied to King Philip (as the Wampanoag leader Metacom was known to the English); in fact, Andros provided gunpowder to Rhode Island that was used in the Great Swamp Fight against the Narragansetts in December 1675, and specifically outlawed the sale of munitions to tribes known to be allied to Philip. The charges poisoned the atmosphere between Andros and Massachusetts leaders, even though Andros&#x27; conduct met with approval in London.
In the meeting with the Iroquois, Andros was given the name &quot;Corlaer&quot;, a name historically used by the Iroquois to refer to the Dutch governor in New Netherland and continued when the English took over the colony and renamed it New York (in the same way the French governor was dubbed &quot;Onontio&quot;). One other consequence was the establishment at Albany of a colonial department for Indian affairs, with Robert Livingston as its first head.

Philip was known to be in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts that winter and New Englanders accused Andros of sheltering him. Historian John Fiske suggests that Philip&#x27;s purpose was not to draw the Iroquois into the conflict but instead to draw the Mahicans into the conflict to attack Albany. An offer by Andros to send New York troops into Massachusetts to attack Philip was rebuffed based on the idea that it was a covert ploy to assert authority over the Connecticut River again. Instead, Mohawks from the Albany area did battle with Philip, driving him eastward. When Connecticut authorities later appealed to Andros for assistance, Andros replied that it was &quot;strange&quot; that they would do so, considering their previous behavior, and refused to help.

In July 1676, Andros established a haven for the Mahicans and other Indian war refugees at Schaghticoke. Although the conflict came to an end in southern New England in 1676, there continued to be friction between the Abenakis of northern New England and New England settlers. These prompted Andros to send a force to the duke&#x27;s territory in Maine, where they established a fort at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol). Andros annoyed Massachusetts fishermen by restricting their use of the duke&#x27;s land for drying fish.

In November 1677, Andros departed for England, where he would spend the following year. During this visit, he was knighted as a reward for his performance as governor, and he sat in on meetings of the Lords of Trade in which agents for Massachusetts Bay defended its charter, and gave detailed accounts of the state of his colony.

===Southern border disputes===
The southernmost territories of the duke, roughly encompassing northern Delaware, were desired by Charles Calvert, Baron Baltimore, who sought to extend the reach of his proprietary Province of Maryland into the area. At the same time, Calvert was seeking an end to a frontier war with the Iroquois to the north, having persuaded the intervening Susquehannocks to move to the Potomac River, well within Maryland territory. Furthermore, the Lenape, who dominated Delaware Bay, were unhappy with seizures of their lands by Virginia and Maryland settlers, and war between these groups had been imminent in 1673 when the Dutch retook New York.

When Andros came to New York, he moved to stabilize the situation. He befriended the Lenape sachems (chiefs), convincing them to act as mediators between the English and other tribes. Peace appeared to be imminent when Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion broke out in Virginia, resulting in an attack on the Susquehannock fort on the Potomac. The surviving Susquehannocks sneaked out of the fort one night, some making their way east toward Delaware Bay. In June 1676, Andros offered, in exchange for their moving into his jurisdiction, to protect them from their enemies among the Virginian and Maryland settlers. He also extended an offer given by the Mohawk for the Susquehannocks to settle among them. These offers were well received, but Maryland authorities could not convince their Indian allies to accept Andros&#x27; offered peace terms, organizing them to march toward the Delaware to fulfill the goal of strengthening the Maryland claim to the area. Andros responded by urging the Susquehannocks to retreat into New York, where they would be beyond Maryland&#x27;s reach, and delivering a strongly worded threat to Maryland, that it would either have to acknowledge his sovereignty over the Susquehannocks, or they would have to take them back peaceably. He also offered his services as a mediator, pointing out that the absence of the Susquehannocks now left Maryland settlements open to direct attack by the Iroquois.

In a council held at the Lenape village of Shackamaxon (site of present-day Philadelphia) in February and March 1677, all of the major parties met; still, no final agreements were reached, and Andros ordered the Susquehannocks remaining with the Lenape to disperse to other parts of New York in April. Maryland sent Henry Coursey to New York to engage Andros and eventually the Iroquois in peace talks, while at the same time, they sent surveyors to lay out plots on land also claimed by New York on Delaware Bay. Coursey was instructed to offer Andros what was, in essence, a £100 bribe that an Indian peace might be reached in exchange for that land. Andros refused the bribe, and Coursey ended up being compelled to negotiate further through Andros and the Mohawk in Albany. The peace agreed upon in negotiations that followed in Albany in the summer of 1677 is considered one of the foundations of the set of alliances and treaties called the Covenant Chain.

Although Andros could not prevent Baltimore from granting some land on the Delaware, he successfully blunted the Maryland leader&#x27;s attempt to control an even greater portion of land. The duke eventually deeded those lands to William Penn, and they became part of the state of Delaware.

===Control of the Jerseys===

The governance of the Jerseys also created problems for Andros. James had awarded the territory west of the Hudson River to proprietors John Berkeley and George Carteret, and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion (which became known as West Jersey) to a partnership of Quakers. Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group, and the exact nature of the rights James had given both Berkeley and Carteret was disputed, in part, because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he had made to Berkeley and Carteret.

This resulted in conflict when Andros attempted to extend his government over East Jersey, the territory governed on behalf of Carteret by the latter&#x27;s cousin Philip. Possibly based on orders given to him during his visit to England, Andros began to assert New York authority over East Jersey after George Carteret&#x27;s death in 1680. Despite a friendly personal relationship between Andros and Governor Carteret, the governance issue eventually prompted Andros to have Carteret arrested. In a dispute centering on the collection of customs duties in ports on the Jersey side of the Hudson, Andros, in 1680, sent a company of soldiers to Philip Carteret&#x27;s home in Elizabethtown. According to Carteret&#x27;s account of the incident, he was beaten by the troops, who jailed him in New York.

A jury acquitted Carteret on all charges in a trial over which Andros presided. Carteret returned to New Jersey, but injuries he sustained in the arrest affected his health, and he died in 1682. In the aftermath of the incident, the Duke of York surrendered his claims to East Jersey to the Carterets. Andros acquired in 1683, from the widow of Carteret, for £200, the Patent to the Lordship of Alderney.

A less contentious standoff also occurred when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish what is now Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they had no right to settle there without the duke&#x27;s permission. Still, he agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.

===Recall and analysis===
The political opponents of Andros in the colony brought several charges against him to the Duke of York. Among them were accusations of favoritism toward Dutch business owners and engaging in business for private gain rather than that of the duke. Statements were also made to the duke that claimed that his revenues were lower than they should have been; this, in addition to the other complaints, led the duke to order Andros back to England to explain the situation. Andros left the province in January 1681, charging Anthony Brockholls with the administration of the New York government. Expecting a short visit to England, his wife remained in New York.

During his time in New York, he was thought to have demonstrated good administrative abilities. Still, his manner was considered imperious by his opponents among the colonists, and he made numerous enemies during his tenure as governor.

==Dominion of New England==
In 1686 he was appointed governor of the Dominion of New England. He arrived in Boston on 20 December 1686, and immediately assumed power. His commission called for governance by himself, with a council. The initial composition of the council included representatives from each of the colonies the dominion absorbed. Still, because of the inconvenience of travel and the fact that travel costs were not reimbursed, the council&#x27;s quorums were dominated by representatives from Massachusetts and Plymouth. The Lords of Trade had insisted that he govern without an assembly, something he expressed concern over while his commission was being drafted. In a brief work, &quot;Sir Edmund Andros&quot;, historian Henry Ferguson attested to the fact that the deliberation of certain policies by an assembly of legislators may have proven inefficient.

The Dominion initially consisted of the territories of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (including present-day Maine), Plymouth Colony, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire, and was extended to include New York, and East and West Jersey in 1688. Andros&#x27; wife, who had joined him in Boston, died in 1688, not long after her arrival.

===Church of England===
Shortly after his arrival, Andros asked each of the Puritan churches in Boston if its meetinghouse could be used for the Church of England services. When he was rebuffed, he demanded and was given keys to Samuel Willard&#x27;s Third Church in 1687. Services were held there under the auspices of Rev. Robert Ratcliff until 1688, when King&#x27;s Chapel was built. These actions highlighted him as pro-Anglican in the eyes of local Puritans, who would later accuse him of involvement in a &quot;horrid Popish plot.&quot;

===Revenue laws===
His council engaged in a lengthy process to harmonize dominion and English laws. This work consumed so much time that Andros, in March 1687, issued a proclamation stating that pre-existing laws would remain in effect until they were revised. Since Massachusetts had no pre-existing tax laws, a scheme of taxation was created that would apply to the entire dominion. Developed by a committee of landowners, the first proposal derived its revenues from import duties, principally alcohol. After much debate, a different proposal was abruptly proposed and adopted, reviving previous Massachusetts tax laws. These laws had been unpopular with farmers who felt the taxes on livestock were too high. To bring in immediate revenue, Andros also received approval to increase the import duties on alcohol.

Many Massachusetts communities stiffly resisted the first attempts to enforce the revenue laws. Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates, and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston. Some were fined and released, while others were imprisoned until they promised to perform their duties. The leaders of Ipswich, who had been most vocal in opposing the law, were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses.

The other provinces did not resist the imposition of the new law, even though, at least in Rhode Island, the rates were higher than they had been under the previous colonial administration. Plymouth&#x27;s relatively poor landowners were hard hit because of the high rates on livestock, and funds derived from whaling, once sources of profit for the individual towns, were now directed to the dominion government.

===Town meeting laws===
One consequence of the tax protest was that Andros sought to restrict town meetings since these were where that protest had begun. He, therefore, introduced a law that limited meetings to a single annual meeting solely for electing officials and explicitly banned meetings at other times for any reason. This loss of local power was widely hated. Many protests were made that the town meeting and tax laws were violations of the &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, which guaranteed taxation by representatives of the people. It was noted that those who made these complaints had, during the colonial charter, excluded large numbers of voters through the requirement of church membership and then taxed them.

===Land title reform===
Andros had been instructed to bring colonial land title practices more in line with those in England and introduce quit-rents to raise colonial revenues. Titles previously issued in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine under the colonial administration often suffered from defects of the form (for example, lacking an imprint of the colonial seal), and most of them did not include a quit-rent payment. Land grants in colonial Connecticut and Rhode Island had been made before either colony had a charter, and there were conflicting claims in some areas.

How Andros approached the issue was necessarily divisive since it threatened any landowner whose title was dubious. Some landowners went through the confirmation process, but many refused since they did not want to face the possibility of losing their land, and they viewed the process as a thinly veiled land grab. The Puritans of Plymouth and Massachusetts, some of whom had extensive landholdings, were among the latter. Since all of the existing land titles in Massachusetts had been granted under the now-vacated colonial charter, Andros essentially declared them void. He required landowners to recertify their ownership, paying fees to the dominion and becoming subject to the charging of a quit-rent.

Andros attempted to compel the certification of ownership by issuing writs of intrusion, but large landowners who owned many parcels contested these individually rather than recertifying all of their lands.

===Connecticut charter===
Since Andros&#x27; commission included Connecticut, he asked Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter not long after he arrived in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros&#x27; authority but did little to assist him. They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly legislature meetings and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter.

In October 1687, Andros finally decided to travel to Connecticut to see the matter personally. Accompanied by an honor guard, he arrived in Hartford on 31 October and met with the colonial leadership that evening. According to legend, the charter was laid out on the table for all to see during this meeting. The lights in the room unexpectedly went out, and when relit, the charter had disappeared. The charter was said to have been hidden in a nearby oak tree (referred to afterward as the Charter Oak) so that a search of nearby buildings would not locate the document.
Whatever the truth of the account, Connecticut records show that its government formally surrendered its seals and ceased operation that day. Andros then traveled throughout the colony, making judicial and other appointments, before returning to Boston. On 29 December 1687, the dominion council formally extended its laws over Connecticut, completing the assimilation of the New England colonies.

===Inclusion of New York and the Jerseys===
On 7 May 1688, the provinces of New York, East Jersey, and West Jersey were added to the Dominion. Because they were remote from Boston, where Andros had his seat, New York and the Jerseys were run by Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson from New York City. Nicholson, an army captain and protégé of colonial secretary William Blathwayt, came to Boston in early 1687 as part of Andros&#x27; honor guard and had been promoted to his council.

During the summer of 1688, Andros traveled first to New York and then to the Jerseys to establish his commission. Dominion governance of the Jerseys was complicated because the proprietors, whose charters had been revoked, had retained their property and petitioned Andros for what were traditional manorial rights. The dominion period in the Jerseys was relatively uneventful due to their distance from the power centers and the unexpected end of the dominion in 1689.

===Indian diplomacy===
In 1687 the governor of New France, the Marquis de Denonville, launched an attack against Seneca villages in what is now western New York. His objective was to disrupt trade between the English at Albany and the Iroquois confederation, to which the Seneca belonged, and to break the Covenant Chain, a peace Andros had negotiated in 1677 while he was governor of New York. New York Governor Thomas Dongan appealed for help, and King James ordered Andros to render assistance. James also entered into negotiations with Louis XIV of France, easing tensions on the northwestern frontier. On New England&#x27;s northeastern frontier, however, the Abenaki harbored grievances against New England settlers and began an offensive in early 1688. Andros made an expedition into Maine early in the year, raiding several Indian settlements. He also raided the trading outpost and home of Jean-Vincent d&#x27;Abbadie de Saint-Castin on Penobscot Bay. His careful preservation of the Catholic Castin&#x27;s chapel would be a source of later accusations of &quot;popery&quot; against Andros.
When Andros took over the administration of New York in August 1688, he met with the Iroquois at Albany to renew the covenant. In this meeting, he annoyed the Iroquois by referring to them as &quot;children&quot; (implying subservience to the English) rather than &quot;brethren&quot; (implying equality). He returned to Boston amid further attacks on the New England frontier by Abenaki parties, who admitted that they were doing so in part because of French encouragement.

During Andros&#x27;s presence in New York, the situation in Maine deteriorated again, with groups of colonists raiding Indian villages and taking prisoners. These actions were taken per a directive issued by dominion councillors remaining in Boston, who ordered frontier militia commanders to take into custody any Abenaki suspected of participating in the raids. This directive sparked a problem in Maine, when twenty Abenaki, including women and children, were taken into custody by colonial militia. The local authorities faced the dilemma of housing the captives, shipping them first to Falmouth and then to Boston, angering other natives, who seized English hostages to ensure the safe return of the captives. Andros castigated the Mainers for their unwarranted acts and ordered the Indians released and returned to Maine. A brief skirmish during exchanging captives resulted in the deaths of four English hostages and sparked discontent in Maine. Faced with this discord, Andros returned to Maine with a significant force and began constructing additional fortifications to protect the settlers, including Fort Andross. Andros spent the winter in Maine and returned to Boston in March upon hearing rumors of revolution in England and discontent in Boston.

===Revolt===

On 18 April 1689, soon after news reached Boston of the overthrow of James II of England, the colonists of Boston rose against his rule. A well-organized &quot;mob&quot; descended on the city, arresting dominion officials and Anglicans. Andros had his quarters in Fort Mary, a garrison house on the city&#x27;s south side, where many officials took refuge. The old Massachusetts colonial leadership, restored due to the rebellion and headed by ex-governor Simon Bradstreet, then summoned Governor Andros to surrender, for his safety because of the mob which they claimed &quot;whereof we were wholly ignorant&quot;. He refused, and instead tried to escape to the &quot;Rose&quot;, the only Royal Navy ship near Boston at the time. However, the boat sent from the &quot;Rose&quot; was intercepted by militia, and Andros was forced back into Fort Mary. Negotiations ensued, and Andros agreed to leave the fort to meet with the rebel council. Promised safe conduct, he was marched under guard to the townhouse where the council had assembled. He was told that &quot;they must &amp; would have the Government in their own hands&quot; and that he was under arrest. Daniel Fisher grabbed him by the collar and took him to the home of dominion official John Usher and held under close watch.
After Fort Mary fell into rebel hands on the 19th, Andros was moved there from Usher&#x27;s house. He was confined there with Joseph Dudley and other dominion officials until 7 June, when he was transferred to Castle Island. During this period of captivity, he is said to have attempted an escape dressed in women&#x27;s clothing. The story, although it circulated widely, was disputed by the Anglican minister Robert Ratcliff, who claimed that story and others had &quot;not the least foundation of Truth&quot; and that they were &quot;falsehoods, and lies&quot; propagated to &quot;render the Governour odious to his people.&quot; He escaped Castle Island on 2 August after his servant plied the sentries with alcohol. He managed to flee to Rhode Island but was quickly recaptured and thereafter kept in virtual solitary confinement. He and others were held for ten months before being sent to England for trial. The Massachusetts agents in London refused to sign the charges made against him, so the court summarily dismissed them and freed him. When Andros was questioned about the various accusations that had been leveled against him, he pointed out that all of his actions had been taken to bring colonial laws into conformance with English law, or they were specifically taken in pursuit of his commission and instructions.

While Andros was in captivity, the New York government of Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson was simultaneously deposed by a military faction led by Jacob Leisler, Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion. Leisler would govern New York until 1691 when he was captured and executed by a force led by newly appointed provincial governor Henry Sloughter. Andros was eventually allowed to depart for England; by that point, the Dominion of New England had effectively ceased to exist, with the colonies in the dominion having reverted to their previous forms of governance. Massachusetts and its surrounding territories were reorganized into the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691.

==Governor of Virginia==

Andros was well received at court upon his return to England. The new king, William III, recalled that Andros had visited his court in the Netherlands and expressed approval of Andros&#x27; service. In search of employment, Andros offered his services as a spy, offering the idea of going to Paris, ostensibly to meet with the exiled James, but to actually attempt to acquire French military plans. This plan was rejected. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Crisp Clapham, in England in July 1691. She was the widow of Christopher Clapham, who was connected by that marriage to his first wife&#x27;s family.

Andros&#x27; next opportunity for employment came with the resignation in February 1692 of Lord Effingham as governor of the Province of Virginia. Although Francis Nicholson, formerly dominion lieutenant governor, was then serving as lieutenant governor of Virginia and sought the superior position, William awarded the governorship to Andros, and awarded Nicholson yet another lieutenant governorship, this time that of Maryland. This was destined to make Andros&#x27; tenure more complicated because his relationship with Nicholson had deteriorated for other reasons. The exact reasons for this hostility are unclear: one contemporary wrote that Nicholson &quot;especially [resented] Sir Edmund Andros, against whom he has a particular pique on account of some earlier dealings&quot;.

Andros arrived in Virginia on 13 September 1692 and began his duties a week later. Nicholson graciously received him and not long after sailed for England. Andros settled at Middle Plantation (the future site of Williamsburg), where he would live until 1695. He worked to organize the provincial records, the maintenance of which had suffered since Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, and promoted the enforcement of laws designed to prevent slave rebellions.

He encouraged the diversification of Virginia&#x27;s economy, which was then almost entirely dependent on tobacco. The export-oriented economy was also badly hurt by the ongoing Nine Years&#x27; War, because of which merchant ships were required to travel in convoys. Virginia received no military escorts for several years, so their products did not reach Europe. Andros encouraged the introduction of new crops like cotton and flax and the manufacture of fabric.

Virginia was the first colonial post where Andros had to work with a local assembly. His relationship with the House of Burgesses was generally cordial, but he encountered some resistance, especially to measures related to the war and colonial defenses. He hired armed vessels to patrol the colony&#x27;s waters and contributed financially to New York&#x27;s colonial defenses, which formed a bulwark against the possibility of French and Indian incursions into Virginia. In 1696 Andros was ordered by the king to send troops to New York, for which the burgesses reluctantly appropriated £1,000. Andros&#x27; management of colonial defense and Indian relations was successful: Virginia, unlike New York and New England, was not attacked during the war.

During his tenure, Andros made an enemy of James Blair, a prominent Anglican minister. Blair was working to establish a new college for educating Anglican ministers, and he believed Andros did not support the idea. However, Blair and Nicholson worked closely together on this idea, with Nicholson often coming from Maryland for meetings on the subject. The two men were united in their dislike of Andros, and their activities helped to cause Andros&#x27; resignation. The College of William and Mary was founded in 1693. Despite Blair&#x27;s claims that Andros was unsupportive, Andros donated the cost of the bricks to construct the college&#x27;s chapel from his own funds and convinced the House of Burgesses to approve funding of £100 per year for the college.

Blair&#x27;s complaints, many of them vague and inaccurate, went to London, where proceedings into Andros&#x27; conduct began at the Board of Trade and the Church of England ecclesiastical courts in 1697. Andros had lost most of his support on the Board of Trade when a Whig faction came to power, and his advocates were unable to sway the board in favor of him. Anglican bishops staunchly supported Blair and Nicholson. In March 1698, Andros, complaining of fatigue and illness, asked to be recalled.

==Later years==
Andros&#x27; recall was announced in London in May 1698; Nicholson replaced him. He returned to England and resumed his post as bailiff of Guernsey. He divided his time between Guernsey and London, where he had a house in Denmark Hill. His second wife died in 1703, and he married for the third time in 1707, to Elizabeth Fitzherbert. 

In 1704, Queen Anne named him Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey, a post he held until 1708. He died in London on 24 February 1714 and was buried at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho. Elizabeth Andros died in 1717 and was buried near Edmund in the same church. The church was destroyed during the Second World War, and there is no longer any trace of their graves. He had no issue by any of his wives.

==Legacy==
The historian Michael Kammen states that Andros failed in all of his roles in the colonies:

Andros remains a notorious figure in New England, especially in Connecticut, which officially excludes him from its list of colonial governors, but his portrait hangs in the Hall of Governors in the State Museum across from the State Capitol in Hartford. Although he was disliked in the colonies, he was recognized in England as an effective administrator by implementing the policies that he had been ordered to carry out and advancing the crown&#x27;s agenda. The biographer Mary Lou Lustig notes that he was &quot;an accomplished statesman, a brave soldier, a polished courtier, and a devoted servant&quot;, but his style was often &quot;autocratic, arbitrary, and dictatorial&quot;, he lacked tact, and he had difficulty reaching compromises.

Similarly, Andros was featured as an antagonist in the 1879 novel &quot;Captain Nelson&quot;, described as a &quot;romance of colonial days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake/fiction&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Andros appears in several episodes of &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; in which his conflict with the Connecticut colonists forms the background to the protagonist&#x27;s more personal problems. It is believed that Andros Island in the Bahamas was named for him. Early proprietors of the Bahamas included members of his first wife&#x27;s family, the Cravens.

<doc id="250832" wikidata="Q1452585" url="?curid=250832" title="Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter">
<text>Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, 3rd Earl of Huntington (27 June 1430 – September 1475) was a Lancastrian leader during the English Wars of the Roses. He was the only son of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, and his first wife, Anne Stafford.

==Career==
He inherited the Dukedom of Exeter and Earl of Huntington when his father died in 1447. However, he was cruel, savagely temperamental and unpredictable, and so had little support. P.M. Kendall describes him as &quot;dangerous&quot;, and was seen as &quot;cruel and fierce&quot; by contemporary Italian observers.

==Constable of the Tower==
Exeter was for a time Constable of the Tower of London, and afterwards the rack there came to be called &quot;the Duke of Exeter&#x27;s daughter&quot;.

==Wars of the Roses==
In 1447 he married Anne, the eight-year-old daughter of Richard of York. However, in the Wars of the Roses, he remained loyal to Henry VI against the Yorkists. He was imprisoned at Wallingford Castle when York briefly seized power after the First Battle of St Albans in 1455. In 1458 he participated in the Love Day, an attempt at reconciliation between the rival factions. He was a commander at the Lancastrian victories at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460 and the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, and in the decisive defeat at Towton in 1461. He fled to Scotland after the battle, and then joined Queen Margaret in her exile in France. He was attainted in 1461, and his estates were given to his wife, who separated from him in 1464. During the brief period of Henry VI&#x27;s restoration he was able to regain many of his estates and posts.

At the Battle of Barnet, Exeter commanded the Lancastrian left flank. He was badly wounded and left for dead, but survived. Afterwards he was imprisoned, and Anne divorced him in 1472. He &quot;volunteered&quot; to serve on Edward IV&#x27;s 1475 expedition to France. On the return voyage he fell overboard and drowned, his body being found in the sea between Dover and Calais, Fabyan saying &quot;but how he drowned, the certainty is not known&quot;. However, Giovanni Panicharolla, the Milanese envoy to the Burgundian court, was told by Duke Charles that the King of England had given specific orders for the sailors to throw his former brother-in-law overboard.

==Family==
On 30 January 1446, in the chapel of the Bishop of Ely, Hatfield, Herefordshire, he married Anne of York, the eldest child of Richard, Duke of York, and Cecily Neville. She was an older sister of Edward IV and Richard III.

He had one legitimate child:
*Anne Holland (1461 – between 26 August 1467 and 6 June 1474), who married Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset.

Since Henry had no legitimate male issue the disposition of his estates became a complex matter for his widow, the dowager Duchess of Exeter.

<doc id="250833" wikidata="Q727346" url="?curid=250833" title="David Brainerd">
<text>David Brainerd (April 20, 1718October 9, 1747) was an American Presbyterian minister and missionary to the Native Americans among the Delaware Indians of New Jersey. Missionaries such as William Carey and Jim Elliot, and Brainerd&#x27;s cousin, the Second Great Awakening evangelist James Brainerd Taylor (1801–1829) cite Brainerd as inspiration.

==Biography==

===Early life===

David Brainerd was born on April 20, 1718, in Haddam, Connecticut, the son of Hezekiah Brainerd, a Connecticut legislator, and Dorothy Hobart. He had nine siblings, one of whom was Dorothy&#x27;s from a previous marriage. He was orphaned at the age of nine years, as his father died in 1727 at the age of 46 and his mother died five years later.

After his mother&#x27;s death, Brainerd moved to East Haddam to live with one of his older sisters, Jerusha. At the age of nineteen, he inherited a farm near Durham, but returned to East Haddam a year later to prepare to enter Yale. On July 12, 1739, he recorded having an experience of &quot;unspeakable glory&quot; that prompted in him a &quot;hearty desire to exalt [God], to set him on the throne and to &#x27;seek first his Kingdom&#x27;&quot;. This has been interpreted by evangelical scholars as a conversion experience.

===Preparing for ministry===
Two months later, he enrolled at Yale. In his second year at Yale, he was sent home because he was suffering from a serious illness, tuberculosis, that caused him to spit blood. When he returned in November 1740, tensions were beginning to emerge at Yale between the faculty staff and the students as the staff considered the spiritual enthusiasm of the students, which had been prompted by visiting preachers such as George Whitefield, Gilbert Tennent, Ebenezer Pemberton and James Davenport, to be excessive. Brainerd was expelled because of comments about the impious staff. 

A recent law forbade the appointment of ministers in Connecticut unless they had graduated from Harvard, Yale, or a European institution, so Brainerd had to reconsider his plans. In 1742, Brainerd was licensed to preach by a group of evangelicals known as New Lights. As a result, he gained the attention of Jonathan Dickinson, the leading Presbyterian in New Jersey, who unsuccessfully attempted to reinstate Brainerd at Yale. Instead, Dickinson suggested that Brainerd devote himself to missionary work among the Native Americans, supported by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge. He was approved for this missionary work on November 25, 1742.

===Entering mission===
On April 1, 1743, after a brief period serving a church on Long Island, Brainerd began working as a missionary to Native Americans, which he would continue until late 1746 when he became too ill. In his late life, he also experienced depression, loneliness, and lack of food.

His first missionary assignment was working at Kaunameek, a Mohican settlement near present-day Nassau, New York. Brainerd remained there for one year.

In 1743, he was reassigned to work among the Delaware Indians along the Delaware River northeast of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he remained for another year, during which he was ordained by the Newark Presbytery. After this, he moved to Crossweeksung in New Jersey. Within a year, the Native American church at Crossweeksung had 130 members, who moved in 1746 to Cranbury where they established a Christian community.

In these years, he refused several offers of leaving the mission field to become a church minister. He continued his work converting Native Americans, writing in his diary:
&#x27;[I] could have no freedom in the thought of any other circumstances or business in life: All my desire was the conversion of the heathen, and all my hope was in God: God does not suffer me to please or comfort myself with hopes of seeing friends, returning to my dear acquaintance, and enjoying worldly comforts&#x27;.
===Death===
In November 1746, he became too ill to continue ministering, and so moved to Jonathan Dickinson&#x27;s house in Elizabethtown and later to Jonathan Edwards&#x27; house in Northampton, Massachusetts. Apart from a trip to Boston in the summer of that year, he remained at Edwards&#x27;s house until his death the following year. In May 1747, he was diagnosed with incurable consumption. In his diary entry for September 24, Brainerd wrote:
&#x27;In the greatest distress that ever I endured having an uncommon kind of hiccough; which either strangled me or threw me into a straining to vomit&#x27;.

During this time, he was nursed by Jerusha Edwards, Jonathan&#x27;s seventeen-year-old daughter. The friendship grew between them and &quot;many speculate that there was deep (even romantic) love between them&quot;. He died from tuberculosis on October 9, 1747, at the age of 29. Jerusha died in February 1748 as a result of contracting tuberculosis from nursing Brainerd.

After his death, his younger brother John Brainerd continued his work.

==Legacy==

===Impact on the church and mission===
He made a handful of converts, but became widely known in the 1800s due to books about him. His &quot;Journal&quot; was published in two parts in 1746 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.

Much of Brainerd&#x27;s influence on future generations can be attributed to the biography compiled by Jonathan Edwards and first published in 1749 under the title of &quot;An Account of the Life of the Late Reverend Mr. David Brainerd&quot;. It gained immediate recognition, with eighteenth-century theologian John Wesley urging: &#x27;Let every preacher read carefully over the &quot;Life of David Brainerd&quot;″. From the eighteenth century, missionaries also found inspiration and encouragement from the biography. Gideon Hawley wrote in the midst of struggles:

&#x27;I need, greatly need, something more than humane [human or natural] to support me. I read my Bible and Mr. Brainerd&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;, the only books I brought with me, and from them have a little support&#x27;.

Other missionaries who have asserted the influence of Jonathan Edwards&#x27;s biography of Brainerd on their lives include Henry Martyn, William Carey, Jim Elliot, and Adoniram Judson.

===Impact on higher education===
Brainerd&#x27;s life also played a role in the establishment of Princeton College and Dartmouth College. The &#x27;College of New Jersey&#x27; (later Princeton) was founded due to the dissatisfaction of the New York and New Jersey Presbyterian Synods with Yale; their expulsion of Brainerd and subsequent refusal to readmit him was an important factor in driving individuals such as Jonathan Dickinson and Aaron Burr to act on this dissatisfaction. Indeed, classes began in Dickinson&#x27;s house in May 1747, while Brainerd was recovering there. Dartmouth College originated from a school founded by Eleazar Wheelock for Native Americans and colonists in 1748, and Wheelock had been inspired by Brainerd&#x27;s example of Native American education.

Students at Lafayette College founded the Brainerd Evangelical Society based on Brainerd&#x27;s teachings in order to &quot;promote Christian Missions and the Evangelization of the World&quot;. In 1902, they constructed a building known as Brainerd Hall (now Hogg Hall) to house their religious meetings, and serve as a recreational facility on campus.

==Archival collections==
The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has papers for David Brainerd that consist of a letter by Brainerd (c. 1743) to Rev. Joseph Bellamy and notes concerning Brainerd’s published works by Rev. Arthur Bennett, an Anglican clergyman.

<text>Theodore Christianson (September 12, 1883December 9, 1948) was an American politician who served as the 21st Governor of Minnesota from January 6, 1925, until January 6, 1931.

==Early life and education==
Christianson was born in Lac qui Parle Township, Minnesota. He was of Norwegian descent. He attended Dawson High School. Christianson graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1906 and the University of Minnesota Law School in 1909. He was admitted to the Minnesota State Bar in 1909.

== Career ==
Before entering politics, Christianson had pursued dual careers in western Minnesota, where he practiced law and was editor and publisher of the &quot;Dawson Sentinel&quot; for fifteen years. During his time with the &quot;Dawson Sentinel&quot;, Christianson published anti-German and anti-Bolshevik editorials, particularly targeting Albert Pfaender, son of William Pfaender, of New Ulm. He served as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives for five terms.

&quot;More Ted, Less Taxes&quot; was the Christians&#x27;s campaign slogan when he ran for governor in 1924. During his administration, he limited taxes and cut expenditures at every level of state government. He was re-elected twice.

During his tenure as governor, Christianson established a three-member Commission of Administration and Finance. This so-called &quot;Big Three&quot; unleashed the veto power of the chief executive, who slashed budget appropriations he considered extravagant.

In 1925, the Minnesota Senate and House of Representatives passed a bill for eugenics-based sterilization. Governor Christianson signed the bill into law, and on January 8, 1926, six women living in a mental asylum in Fairbault were sterilized.

Christianson held mail correspondence and met with H. E. Kettering, Minnesota Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1926, W. A. Kanorr sent a letter to Christianson describing members of the Ku Klux Klan working postmaster positions across Minnesota and the broader United States to keep track of citizens&#x27; activities through their mail.

Christianson was a candidate for the 1930 United States Senate election in Minnesota, placing second in the Republican primary after incumbent Senator Thomas Schall. During a three-year hiatus from politics, Christianson wrote five-volume history text called &quot;The Land of Sky-Tinted Waters: A History of the State and its People&quot;. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1932 and served until 1937. In 1936, he did not run for re-election to the House, opting to launch another bid for the Senate in the 1936 election. Receiving the Republican nomination, he ran against former congressman Ernest Lundeen of the Farmer Labor Party and was defeated, receiving 37% of the vote.

After leaving politics, Christianson moved to Chicago and served as secretary-manager of the National Association of Retail Grocers from 1937 to 1939. He was public relations counsel for the National Association of Retail Druggists from 1938 to 1945, and editor of &quot;The Journal of the National Association of Retail Druggists: Official Organ of the N.A.R.D.&quot; from 1945 to 1948.

==Personal life==
His son was Theodore Christianson who served on the Minnesota Supreme Court.

Christianson retired to Dawson, Minnesota, when he died of a heart attack at 65. He is interred at Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

In 1989, Christianson was honored as the first gnome in Dawson, Minnesota. Annually, one person is chosen who has served the community to be depicted as a gnome. The gnome of &quot;Governor Ted&quot; can be found in the Dawson Public Library and is made of wood.

<doc id="250835" wikidata="Q5725537" url="?curid=250835" title="Henry Martyn">
<text>Henry Martyn (18 February 1781 – 16 October 1812) was an Anglican priest and missionary to the peoples of India and Persia. Born in Truro, Cornwall, he was educated at Truro Grammar School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. A chance encounter with Charles Simeon led him to become a missionary. He was ordained a priest in the Church of England and became a chaplain for the British East India Company.

Martyn arrived in India in April 1806, where he preached and occupied himself in the study of linguistics. He translated the whole of the New Testament into Urdu, Persian and Judaeo-Persic. He also translated the Psalms into Persian and the Book of Common Prayer into Urdu. From India, he set out for Bushire, Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz.

Martyn was seized with fever, and, though the plague was raging at Tokat, he was forced to stop there, unable to continue. On 16 October 1812, he died. He was remembered for his courage, selflessness, and his religious devotion. In parts of the Anglican Communion he is celebrated with a Lesser Festival on 19 October. Martyn&#x27;s papers and private letters are held at the Cambridge Centre for Christianity Worldwide at Westminster College in Cambridge, England.

==Early life==
Martyn was born in Truro, Cornwall, on 18 February 1781. His father, John Martyn, was a &quot;captain&quot; or mine-agent at Gwennap. As a boy, he was educated at Truro grammar school under Dr. Cardew and he entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in the autumn of 1797, and was senior wrangler and first Smith&#x27;s prizeman in 1801. In 1802, he was chosen as a fellow of his college.

He had intended to go to the bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon speaking of the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon&#x27;s curate at Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, taking charge of the Cambridgeshire parish of Lolworth.

==Missionary work==
Martyn wanted to offer his services to the Church Missionary Society, when a financial disaster in Cornwall deprived him and his unmarried sister of the income their father had left for them. It was necessary for Martyn to earn an income that would support his sister as well as himself. He accordingly obtained a chaplaincy under the British East India Company and left for India on 5 July 1805. On his voyage to the East, Martyn happened to be present at the British conquest of the Cape Colony on 8 January 1806. He spent that day tending to the dying soldiers and was distressed by seeing the horrors of war. He would come away feeling that it was Britain&#x27;s destiny to convert, not colonize, the world. He wrote in his diary:

===India===
Martyn arrived in India in April 1806, and for some months he was stationed at Aldeen, near Serampur. In October 1806, he proceeded to Dinapur, where he was soon able to conduct worship among the locals in the vernacular, and established schools. In April 1809, he was transferred to Cawnpore, where he preached to British and Indians in his own compound, in spite of interruptions and threats from local non-Christians.

He occupied himself in linguistic study, and had already, during his residence at Dinapur, been engaged in revising the sheets of his Hindustani version of the New Testament. He now translated the whole of the New Testament into Urdu also, and into Persian twice. His work for the Persian Bible included translating the Psalms into Persian, the Gospels into Judaeo-Persic, and the Book of Common Prayer into Urdu, in spite of ill-health and &quot;the pride, pedantry and fury of his chief munshi Sabat.&quot; Ordered by the doctors to take a sea voyage, he obtained leave to go to Persia and correct his Persian New Testament. From there, he wanted to go to Arabia, and there compose an Arabic version. On 1 October 1810, having seen his work at Cawnpore rewarded on the previous day by the opening of a church, he left for Calcutta, from where he sailed on 7 January 1811 for Bombay. The ship reached port on his thirtieth birthday.

==Final voyage and death==
From Bombay he set out for Bushire, bearing letters from Sir John Malcolm to men of position there, as also at Shiraz and Isfahan. After an exhausting journey from the coast he reached Shiraz, and was soon plunged into discussion with the disputants of all classes, &quot;Sufi, Muslim, Jew, and Jewish Muslim, even Armenian, all anxious to test their powers of argument with the first English priest who had visited them.&quot; He next traveled to Tabriz to attempt to present the Shah with his translation of the New Testament, which proved unsuccessful. Sir Gore Ouseley, the British ambassador to the Shah, was unable to bring about a meeting, but did deliver the manuscript. Although Martyn could not present the Bible in person, the Shah later wrote him a letter:

At this time, he was seized with fever, and after a temporary recovery, had to seek a change of climate. He set off for Constantinople, where he intended to return on furlough to England to regain his strength and recruit help for the missions in India. On 12 September 1812, he started with two Armenian servants and crossed the Aras River. Urged on from place to place by their Tatar guide, they rode from Tabriz to Erivan, from Erivan to Kars, and from Kars to Erzurum. They departed Erzurum and though the plague was raging at Tokat, he was forced to stop there, unable to continue. He wrote his final journal entry on 6 October. It read, in part:

On 16 October 1812 he died and was given a Christian burial by Armenian clergy.

He was heard to say, &quot;Let me burn out for God&quot;. An indication of his zeal for the things of God.

==Legacy==
His devotion to his tasks won him much admiration in Great Britain and he was the hero of a number of literary publications. Thomas Babington Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Epitaph&quot;, composed early in 1813, testified to the impression made by his career:
An institution was established in his name in India, called the Henry Martyn Institute: An Interfaith Centre for Reconciliation and Research, Hyderabad, India. John McManners wrote in his &quot;Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity&quot; that Martyn was a man remembered for his courage, selflessness and his religious devotion. Henry Martyn is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 19 October.

In 1881, on the centennial of Martyn&#x27;s birth, a trust was created in his name for the purpose of constructing a hall for a library and a place for public lecture on missions. The Henry Martyn Library opened in the Hall in 1898, and there it remained as a small collection of missionary biographies and other books until 1995. The evolution of the Henry Martyn Library into the present Henry Martyn Centre began in 1992, when Canon Graham Kings was appointed as the first Henry Martyn Lecturer in Missiology in the Cambridge Theological Federation. In 2014 the Henry Martyn Centre was renamed the Cambridge Centre for Christianity Worldwide.

<doc id="250836" wikidata="Q312369" url="?curid=250836" title="Boniface I, Marquis of Montferrat">
<text>Boniface I, usually known as Boniface of Montferrat (; ; c. 1150 – 4 September 1207), was the ninth Marquis of Montferrat (from 1192), a leader of the Fourth Crusade (1201–04) and the king of Thessalonica (from 1205).

== Early life ==
Boniface was the third son of William V of Montferrat and Judith of Babenberg, born after his father&#x27;s return from the Second Crusade. He was a younger brother of William &quot;Longsword&quot;, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, and of Conrad I of Jerusalem. His youthful exploits in the late 1170s are recalled in the famous &quot;epic letter&quot;, &quot;Valen marques, senher de Monferrat&quot;, by his good friend and court troubadour, Raimbaut de Vaqueiras. These included the rescue of the heiress Jacopina of Ventimiglia from her uncle Count Otto, who was intending to deprive her of her inheritance and send her to Sardinia. Boniface arranged a marriage for her. When Albert of Malaspina (husband of one of Boniface&#x27;s sisters) abducted Saldina de Mar, a daughter of a prominent Genoese family, Boniface rescued her and restored her to her lover, Ponset d&#x27;Aguilar. Like the rest of the family, he also supported his cousin Frederick I Barbarossa in their wars against the independent city communes of the Lombard League.

Boniface&#x27;s eldest brother, William, had died in 1177, soon after marrying Sibylla, the heiress presumptive to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1179, the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos offered his daughter Maria Porphyrogenita as a bride to one of the sons of William V. Since Boniface, like his older brother Conrad, was already married, and Frederick was a priest, the youngest brother, Renier, married her instead, only to be murdered along with her during the usurpation of Andronikos.

In 1183, Boniface&#x27;s nephew Baldwin V was crowned co-king of Jerusalem. William V went out to the kingdom to support his grandson, leaving Conrad and Boniface in charge of Montferrat. However, in 1187, Conrad also left for the East: Isaac II Angelos had offered his sister Theodora to Boniface as a wife, to renew the family&#x27;s Byzantine alliance, but Boniface had just married for the second time, while Conrad was a recent widower.

In 1189, Boniface joined the council of regency for Thomas I of Savoy, son of his cousin Humbert III, until the boy came of age about two years later. In 1191, after the new Emperor Henry VI granted him the county of Incisa, a fifteen-year war broke out against the neighbouring communes of Asti and Alessandria. Boniface joined the Cremona League, while the two cities joined the League of Milan. Boniface defeated the cities at Montiglio in June that year, but the war as a whole went badly for the dynasty&#x27;s interests. At Quarto, he and Vaqueiras saved his brother-in-law Alberto of Malaspina when he was unhorsed. The first phase of the war ended with a truce in April 1193. By now, Boniface was Marquis of Montferrat, following the deaths of his father in 1191 and of Conrad, the newly elected king of Jerusalem, in 1192. No claim to Montferrat ever seems to have been made on behalf of Conrad&#x27;s posthumous daughter, Maria of Montferrat.

In June 1194, Boniface was appointed one of the leaders of Henry VI&#x27;s expedition to Sicily. At Messina, amid the fighting between the Genoese and Pisan fleets, Vaqueiras protected his lord with his own shield – an act which helped the troubador win a knighthood from Boniface that year, after the campaign&#x27;s successful conclusion: Henry&#x27;s coronation in Palermo. In October 1197, the truce with Asti ended. Boniface made an alliance with Acqui in June 1198. There were numerous skirmishes and raids, including at Ricaldone and Caranzano, but by 1199 it was clear the war was lost, and Boniface entered into negotiations.

Throughout the 1180s and 1190s, despite the wars, Boniface had nevertheless presided over one of the most prestigious courts of chivalric culture and troubador song. In the 12th century, the Piedmontese language (which in the present day reflects more French and Italian influences) was virtually indistinguishable from the Occitan of Southern France and Catalonia. Besides Vaqueiras, visitors included Peire Vidal, Gaucelm Faidit, and Arnaut de Mareuil. Boniface&#x27;s patronage was celebrated widely. To Gaucelm, he was &quot;Mon Thesaur&quot; (&quot;My Treasure&quot;). Curiously, Vaqueiras sometimes addressed him as &quot;N&#x27;Engles&quot; (&quot;Lord Englishman&quot;), but the in-joke is never explained. His sister Azalaïs, Marchioness of Saluzzo, also shared this interest and was mentioned by Vidal.

== Fourth Crusade ==
When the original leader of the Fourth Crusade, Count Theobald III of Champagne, died in 1201, Boniface was chosen as its new leader. He was an experienced soldier, and it was an opportunity to reassert his dynasty&#x27;s reputation after defeat at home. Boniface&#x27;s family was well known in the east: his nephew Baldwin and brother Conrad had been kings of Jerusalem, and his niece Maria was the heir presumptive to the kingdom.

Boniface&#x27;s cousin Philip of Swabia was married to Irene Angelina, a daughter of the deposed Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos and niece of Conrad&#x27;s second wife Theodora. In the winter of 1201 Boniface spent Christmas with Phillip in Hagenau, and while there also met with Alexios IV Angelos, Isaac II&#x27;s son, who had escaped from the custody of his uncle Alexios III Angelos. At this time the three discussed the possibility of using the crusading army to restore Alexios&#x27; right to the throne. Both Boniface and Alexios travelled separately to Rome to ask for Pope Innocent III&#x27;s blessing for the endeavour. Boniface was specifically told by Innocent not to attack any Christians, including the Byzantines.

The Crusader army was in debt to Enrico Dandolo, the doge of Venice, who had provided their fleet. He instructed them to attack the rebellious cities of Trieste, Muggia, and Zara and beat them into submission before sailing for Cairo. The Pope was angered by these Christian cities being attacked by a Crusader army. Dandolo, was now the true war leader of this Crusade, with Boniface as only a figurehead. Alexios IV Angelus made many promises to the Crusaders and their principal financier, the doge of Venice, for riches and honors if they would help him reclaim his empire. Dandolo placated the Pope by having Alexius Angelus promise to submit the Orthodox Church to Rome when he was restored to his throne in Constantinople. This being done, the fleet set sail for Constantinople in 1203.

After the conquest of Constantinople in 1204, Boniface was assumed to be the new emperor, both by the western knights and the conquered Byzantine citizens. However, the Venetians vetoed him, believing that he already had too many connections in the Empire and, likely, felt that they would not have as much influence in the empire if Boniface was in control. Instead, they chose Baldwin of Flanders. Boniface founded the Kingdom of Thessalonica and also held all the territories that lay east of Bosphorus and territories in Crete, though he later conceded Crete to
Baldwin. Late 13th and 14th century sources suggest that Boniface based his claim to Thessalonica on the statement that his younger brother Renier had been granted Thessalonica on his marriage to Maria Komnene in 1180.

Boniface was killed in an ambush by the Vlach on 4 September 1207, and his head was sent to Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan. The loyal Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, who had followed him to the East, probably died with him: it is significant that he composed no &quot;planh&quot; (lament) in his memory.

== Family ==
Boniface was first married c. 1170 to Helena del Bosco. They had:
* William VI, (c. 1173-17 September 1226). Marquis of Montferrat
* Beatrice, married Enrico del Carretto, Marquis of Savona, as the second of his three wives; she is the &quot;Bel Cavalher&quot; (&quot;Fair Knight&quot;) of Vaqueiras&#x27;s songs, composed in the 1190s.
* Agnes of Montferrat (d. 1207), m. Henry of Flanders, Latin emperor of Constantinople, in 1207

In 1205 in Constantinople he married Margaret of Hungary, daughter of King Béla III of Hungary and widow of Emperor Isaac II Angelos. They had one child:
* Demetrius, born c. 1205, who was King of Thessalonica.

<text>Revengers Tragedy is a 2002 film adaptation of the 1606 play &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (attributed to Thomas Middleton in the credits, following the scholarly consensus). It was directed by Alex Cox and adapted for the screen by Cox&#x27;s fellow Liverpudlian, Frank Cottrell-Boyce. The film stars Christopher Eccleston as the revenge-obsessed Vindici, with Derek Jacobi as the evil Duke, Eddie Izzard as his lecherous son Lussurioso, Diana Quick as the Duchess, Andrew Schofield as Vindice&#x27;s brother Carlo (a version of the play&#x27;s Hippolito), Carla Henry as his virtuous sister Castiza, and Marc Warren and Justin Salinger as the Duchess&#x27;s sons Supervacuo and Ambitioso.

==Synopsis==
The original play is set in a depraved Italian court, but Cottrell Boyce&#x27;s screenplay relocates it to a futuristic version of Liverpool in the year 2011, following the aftermath of a natural disaster which has destroyed the southern half of Great Britain. The city is a dystopia in which society is collapsing and where vendettas and the crude exercise of power are the norm. Jacobi&#x27;s Duke is the most powerful crime lord in the city. Cottrell Boyce&#x27;s script rearranges the play heavily and mixes the original Jacobean language with modern language.

==Cast==

==Production==
&quot;Revengers Tragedy&quot; was shot and edited in Liverpool with an almost entirely local crew, including cinematographer Len Gowing, costumer Monica Aslanian, makeup designer Lesley Brennan and assistant director Kim Ryan. Cox&#x27;s usual production designer, Cecilia Montiel prepared a visual strategy which was executed by her co-designer Remi Vaughan-Richards. The producers were Margaret Matheson (who executive produced Cox&#x27;s &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; for Zenith) and Tod Davies (Cox&#x27;s wife, who also wrote and produced Cox&#x27;s &quot;Three Businessmen&quot;).

The soundtrack of the same name was written and performed by Chumbawamba. In 2003, it was released by the band on their independent record label, MUTT.

The film was originally intended to end with a montage of the World Trade Center exploding as Vindici whispered &quot;revenge&quot;, but this was removed at the request of the film&#x27;s stakeholders.

==Reception==
The BBC&#x27;s Jamie Russell gave the film 3/5 stars, stating &quot;it exaggerates the play&#x27;s confused identities, deliberate miscommunications, and sarcastic asides into an overblown exercise in outright camp.&quot; The review further states that the film&#x27;s messages are &quot;ultimately let down by the film&#x27;s rough edges&quot;, and contains &quot;moments that are painfully amateurish&quot;, stating that the film &quot;ultimately annoys as much as it exhilarates.&quot;
&quot;Variety&quot;″s Deborah Young described the film as &quot;ambitious, sometimes exhilarating but ultimately not very new attempt to unleash the power of great literature past by punking it up.&quot; The &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; commented: &quot;The stylistic intention, presumably, was old meets new with a Luhrmann-like flourish, but the modest resources on display result in a look somewhere between threadbare Jarman and school play. One struggles to be impressed.&quot;

<text>Jacob Aall Ottesen Preus ( ; August 28, 1883 – May 24, 1961) was an American politician. He served as the 8th state auditor of Minnesota from January 5, 1915, to January 5, 1921, and as the 20th Governor of Minnesota from January 5, 1921, to January 6, 1925. He was a Republican.

==Background==
He was born in Columbia County, Wisconsin, on August 28, 1883, of Norwegian descent. The grandson, son, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of Lutheran priests, he chose to serve the state rather than the church. He was a 1903 graduate of Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, where his extended family has had a key role in the development, governance, and academic life of the college-community since its founding in 1862.

As a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota Law School he cut his political teeth in Washington as executive clerk to Senator Knute Nelson. Back home after three years, he continued his climb up the Republican ladder of state service toward the governor&#x27;s office.

==Career==

When Preus first ran for governor in 1920, he adamantly opposed the Farmer-Labor Party, a coalition of discontented farmers and laborers who had formed a new political organization. The party, he declaimed, represented &quot;socialism—a political cult that would destroy the principles of private property, our religion, and our homes.&quot;

Despite his reservations about the Farmer-Labor philosophy, Governor Preus nonetheless encouraged the legislature to meet some of the farmers&#x27; demands by broadening cooperatives&#x27; legal powers, making low-interest loans available through the Rural Credit Bureau, and creating the Department of Agriculture. Preus also demanded higher taxes from the owners of ore-rich mines on the Iron Range, expanded highway construction, and improved equal rights and election procedures. His political savvy, combined with an apparent desire to correct inequities, made him a surprisingly prolific reformer.

After completing his second term, Preus became an insurance executive in Chicago. He returned to Minneapolis in 1958 and served until his death as board chairman of Lutheran Brotherhood, a fraternal insurance society he had co-founded in 1917. Lutheran Brotherhood merged with Aid Association for Lutherans in 2002 to become Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.

==Personal life==
Preus was married during 1909 to Idella Louise Haugen. Their son, Jacob Aall Ottesen Preus II, was a theologian, professor, author, and president of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. Their other son, Robert Preus, was a Lutheran pastor, professor, author, theologian, and president of Concordia Theological Seminary. He died on May 24, 1961.

<doc id="250839" wikidata="Q1346720" url="?curid=250839" title="Thomas Chandler Haliburton">
<text>Thomas Chandler Haliburton (17 December 1796 – 27 August 1865) was a Nova Scotian politician, judge, and author who was the first international best-selling fiction author from what is now Canada, and who served as a Conservative Member of Parliament in England. He was the father of the British civil servant Lord Haliburton and of the anthropologist Robert Grant Haliburton.

==Life==
Thomas Chandler Haliburton was born on 17 December 1796, in Windsor, Nova Scotia, to William Hersey Otis Haliburton, a judge and politician, and Lucy Chandler Grant. His mother died when he was a small child. When Thomas was seven, his father married Susanna Davis, the daughter of Michael Francklin, who had been Nova Scotia&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor. He attended University of King&#x27;s College in Windsor, from which he graduated in 1815 to become a lawyer who practiced at Annapolis Royal. Between 1826 and 1829, Haliburton represented Annapolis County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.

Haliburton&#x27;s fame came from his writings on history, politics, farm improvement, and from his &quot;The Clockmaker&quot; serial, which first appeared in the &quot;Novascotian&quot; and was published throughout the British Empire, that described the humorous adventures of Sam Slick.

===Relations with English Burton family===
Thomas Chandler Haliburton resided in England from 1837, where he was hosted and entertained in London by his cousins Decimus Burton, Jane Burton, James Burton, the Egyptologist, Septimus Burton, the solicitor, Octavia Burton, and Jessy Burton. Thomas asked James Burton, the Egyptologist, to check the proofs of his work &quot;Letter Bag of the Great Western&quot;, with which Burton was unimpressed, in 1839, and those of the third series of &quot;The Clockmaker&quot; in 1840. The pair travelled together to Scotland to investigate their common ancestry, and intended to tour Canada and the United States of America together. Thomas Chandler Haliburton&#x27;s daughter, Susannah, was impressed by James Burton, the Egyptologist: she wrote, in 1839, &quot;Mr James I admire very much. He is one of the most well-bred persons I saw &amp;... decidedly the flower of the flock&quot;.

===Retirement and subsequent life===

In 1856, Thomas Chandler Haliburton retired from law and moved to England. In the same year, he married Sarah Harriet Owen Williams. In 1859, Haliburton was elected the Member of Parliament for Launceston, Cornwall as a member of the Conservative minority. He did not stand for re-election in 1865.

Haliburton received an honorary degree from Oxford for his services to literature. He continued writing until his death on August 27, 1865 at his home in Isleworth, where he is buried in its All Saints&#x27; Churchyard.

==Family==
Thomas Chandler Haliburton married Louisa Neville, who was the daughter of Captain Laurence Neville of the Eighth Light Dragoons, and returned to Nova Scotia with her. Louisa&#x27;s story before marriage is related in the &quot;Haliburton Chaplet,&quot; which was edited by their son, Robert Grant Haliburton (Toronto: 1899). The couple had three sons and five daughters: 
*Susannah Lucy Anne (later Weldon) (1817 –1899) who was a well known ceramic collector
*Thomas Jr. was an accomplished musician who became ill with an “original defect of mind” and died in an asylum in Massachusetts at the age of 26.
*Augusta - Mrs. A. F. Haliburton who married an ironmonger
*Emma - Mrs. Bainbridge Smith who married an Anglican Clergymen
*Amelia (25 Jul 1829 – 14 Jan 1902), a landscape artist, married the Rev. Edwin Gilpin, Dean of Nova Scotia, in 1849; by whom she had four sons and one daughter, including Edwin Gilpin (1850–1907), an author
*Robert Grant Haliburton, Q.C. D.C.L. (1831 – 1901), a lawyer and anthropologist
*Laura Charlotte, artist, who married William Cunard, the son of the shipping magnate Sir Samuel Cunard at Windsor, Nova Scotia, 30 December 1851, by whom she had three sons and one daughter. She exhibited her pictures at the Royal Academy and at the Gallery of British Artists.
*Arthur (1832–1907), later 1st Baron Haliburton G.C.B., who was a British civil servant and the first native Canadian to be raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Legacy==
Haliburton promoted immigration to the colonies of British North America, and one of his first written works was an emigrant&#x27;s guide to Nova Scotia that was published in 1823, &quot;A General Description of Nova Scotia; Illustrated by a New and Correct Map&quot; The community of Haliburton, Nova Scotia was named after him. In Ontario, Haliburton County is named after Haliburton in recognition of his work as the first chair of the Canadian Land and Emigration Company.

In 1884, faculty and students at his &quot;alma mater&quot; founded a literary society in honour of the College&#x27;s most celebrated man of letters. The Haliburton Society, still active at the University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax, is the longest-standing collegial literary society throughout the Commonwealth of Nations and North America.

The mention &quot;hurly on the long pond on the ice&quot;, which appears in the second volume of &quot;The Attaché, or Sam Slick in England&quot;, a work of fiction published in 1844, has been interpreted by some as a reference to an ice-hockey-like game he may have played during his years at King&#x27;s College. It is the basis of Windsor&#x27;s disputed claim to being the town that fathered hockey.

In 1902, a memorial to Haliburton and his first wife was erected in Christ Church, Windsor, Nova Scotia, by four of their children: Laura Cunard, Lord Haliburton, and two surviving sisters.

Nova Scotian artist William Valentine painted Haliburton&#x27;s portrait. His former home in Windsor is preserved as a museum.

<text>Samuel Wilberforce, FRS (7 September 1805 – 19 July 1873) was an English bishop in the Church of England, and the third son of William Wilberforce. Known as &quot;Soapy Sam&quot;, Wilberforce was one of the greatest public speakers of his day. He is now best remembered for his opposition to Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution at a debate in 1860.

==Early life==
He was born at Clapham Common, London, the fifth child of William Wilberforce, a major campaigner against the slave trade and slavery, and Barbara Spooner; he was the younger brother of Robert Isaac Wilberforce. He had an Anglican education, outside the English public schools. This was the &quot;private and domestic&quot; pattern of instruction chosen for his sons by William Wilberforce. It concentrated on a traditional teaching of the classics, but in a clerical home environment.

Samuel Wilberforce was from 1812 under Stephen Langston, and then Edward Garrard Marsh. With Henry Hoare of Staplehurst and others, he was a pupil in 1819 at Stanstead Park, near Racton in Sussex, of George Hodson, at that time chaplain to Lewis Way. Hodson was tutoring Albert Way, but gathered a small class of six boys, who included also James Thomason. In 1820 Hodson moved to Maisemore near Gloucester as a curate, taking pupils with him. Wilberforce was schooled under Hodson in Gloucestershire until 1822, when he required coaching for university entrance. For that he went, with his younger brother Henry, to Francis Roach Spragge at Bidborough.

In 1823 Wilberforce entered Oriel College, Oxford. In the United Debating Society, the forerunner of the Oxford Union, he demonstrated some Whig views. His friends included William Ewart Gladstone and Henry Edward Manning, and were nicknamed the &quot;Bethel Union&quot; for their religiosity. Wilberforce&#x27;s student recreations included riding and hunting. He graduated in 1826, taking a first-class degree in mathematics and a second in classics.

Wilberforce in late 1826 tried and failed for a fellowship at Balliol College. He spent the summer and autumn of 1827 touring the continent. He married Emily Sargent, daughter of the rector of East Lavington, West Sussex in 1828. After his marriage a college fellowship was no longer possible. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England. In 1829 he was ordained priest and appointed curate at Checkendon, near Henley-on-Thames.

==Career==

In 1830, Wilberforce was presented by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester, to the rectory of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Brighstone, in the Isle of Wight. In November 1839 he was installed archdeacon of Surrey, in August 1840 he was collated canon of Winchester, and in October he accepted the rectory of Alverstoke.

In January 1841, Wilberforce was made chaplain to Prince Albert, an appointment he owed to an anti-slavery speech he had made some months previously. He was chosen as that year&#x27;s Bampton lecturer, but his wife Emily died on 10 March, and he withdrew. In October 1843, he was appointed by the Archbishop of York to be sub-almoner to the Queen. Later, his part in the revival of the powers of Convocation lessened his influence at court.

In March 1845 Wilberforce accepted the position of Dean of Westminster and, in October the same year, was appointed as the Bishop of Oxford by Sir Robert Peel. This year, also, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He set up a Diocesan Church Building Fund. This gave small grants intended to act as a lever for more substantial funding from other sources, a successful fundraising approach. In 1850 Wilberforce appointed George Edmund Street as architect to the diocese of Oxford. Street built or improved 113 churches there during his tenure. In 1854, Wilberforce opened a theological college at Cuddesdon, now known as Ripon College Cuddesdon, which later was the subject of some controversy over its alleged Romanist tendencies.

After twenty-four years in the diocese of Oxford, Wilberforce was translated by Gladstone to the bishopric of Winchester in 1869.

==Views and controversies==
From an evangelical background and upbringing in line with Clapham Sect orthodoxy, Wilberforce began to develop into a High Churchman and High Tory in the early days of his priesthood. His ideas developed with broader contacts, and the politics of Catholic Emancipation.

===High Churchman===
Although a High Churchman, Wilberforce held aloof from the Oxford Movement. In 1838 his divergence from the Tractarian writers became so evident that John Henry Newman declined further contributions from him to the &quot;British Critic&quot;.

In 1847 Wilberforce, at Newman&#x27;s suggestion, became involved in the Hampden controversy. He signed the remonstrance of 13 bishops to Lord John Russell against the appointment of Hampden, accused of heretical views, to the bishopric of Hereford. He wished to obtain some assurances from Hampden; unsuccessful in this, he withdrew from the suit against him. His handling of process and change of mind marred his intervention, and although he made a public statement of error, Charles Greville expressed a widely-held view that &quot;Sly Sam&quot; had made himself look ridiculous.

In 1850 Charles Blomfield, the Bishop of London, proposed the upper house of a revived Convocation as a court of last resort for the ecclesiastical courts of the Church of England. Wilberforce took up the suggestion, and campaigned with Henry Hoare of Staplehurst that the dormant assemblies of Convocation should be put to use. They won the argument, over a few years.

In 1867 Wilberforce framed the first &quot;Report of the Ritualistic Commission&quot;, in which coercive measures against ritualism were undermined by the use of the word &quot;restrain&quot; instead of &quot;abolish&quot; or &quot;prohibit.&quot; He also tried to soften some resolutions of the second Ritualistic Commission in 1868, and was one of the four who signed the Report with qualifications. He was strongly opposed to the disestablishment of the Irish Church, but when the constituencies decided for it, he advised that no opposition should be made to it by the House of Lords.

===&quot;Contra&quot; Darwin===

Wilberforce took part in the famous 1860 debate concerning evolution at a meeting of the British Association on 30 June. Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley had already clashed on man&#x27;s position in nature two days previously; on the Saturday, at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Wilberforce got his chance to criticise Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection&quot;, especially the implication that humans and various species of apes share common ancestors.

In 1979, JR Lucas argued that &quot;Wilberforce, contrary to the central tenet of the legend, did not prejudge the issue&quot;. He criticised Darwin&#x27;s theory on scientific grounds, arguing that it was not supported by the facts, and he noted that the greatest names in science were opposed to the theory. Nonetheless, Wilberforce&#x27;s speech is generally only remembered today for his inquiry as to whether it was through his grandmother or his grandfather that Huxley considered himself descended from a monkey. Huxley is said to have replied that he would not be ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used his great gifts to obscure the truth. Darwin was not present, but several of his friends replied, with Huxley perhaps the most effective. The popular view may be that Huxley had the better of the exchange; but there is a consensus view of historians that this account of the debate involves later fabrication, and that the outcome was moot. &quot;Reports from the time suggest that everybody enjoyed themselves immensely, and all went cheerfully off to dinner together afterwards&quot;. 

Wilberforce wrote a review of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; for the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. In it, he disagreed with Darwin&#x27;s reasoning.

===&quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;===

His attitude towards &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; in 1861, against which he wrote an article in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, won Wilberforce the gratitude of the Low Churchmen.

===Colenso controversy===

On the publication of John William Colenso&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Romans&quot; in 1861, Wilberforce endeavoured to induce the author to hold a private conference with him; but after the publication of the first two parts of the &quot;Pentateuch Critically Examined&quot; he drew up the address of the bishops which called on Colenso to resign his bishopric.

==Reputation==

The publication of &quot;Universalis Ecclesiae&quot;, the papal bull in 1850 re-establishing a Roman Catholic hierarchy in England, brought the High Church party, of whom Wilberforce had become a prominent member, into temporary disrepute. The secession to Catholicism of his brother-in-law Manning, and then of his brothers, as well as his only daughter and his son-in-law, brought him under suspicion.

&quot;Soapy Sam&quot; may have been a reference to Wilberforce&#x27;s characteristic hand-washing gesture, captured in the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; cartoon by &quot;Ape&quot; (&quot;illustration, right&quot;). The nickname may also derive from a comment by Benjamin Disraeli that the bishop&#x27;s manner was &quot;unctuous, oleaginous, saponaceous&quot;. 

Wilberforce has been called the &quot;bishop of society&quot;; but society occupied only a fraction of his time. In the House of Lords he took a prominent part in the discussion of social and ecclesiastical questions.

==Death==
Wilberforce died from a riding accident on 19 July 1873, near Abinger. He had been on the way to visit Gladstone at Holmbury St Mary, with Lord Granville. He was buried at East Lavington with his wife and her sister, the wife of Manning.

==Works==
Wilberforce published:

* A tract on tithes (1831), &quot;to correct the prejudices of the lower order of farmers&quot;.
* A collection of hymns for use in his parish (1832), which had a more general circulation
* &quot;Note Book of a Country Clergyman&quot;, stories
* &quot;The Apostolical Ministry&quot;, sermon.
* &quot;Letters and Journals&quot; (1837) of Henry Martyn, the Anglican missionary.
* &quot;Life&quot; (1838) of his father William Wilberforce published, with his elder brother Robert Wilberforce.
* &quot;Eucharistica&quot; (1839, editor) from the old English divines.
* &quot;Agathos and other Sunday Stories&quot; (1839)
* &quot;University Sermons&quot; (1839)
* &quot;Correspondence&quot; (1840) of William Wilberforce 
* &quot;Rocky Island and other Parables&quot; (1840)
* &quot;A History of the Protestant Episcopal Church in America&quot; (1844) 
* &quot;Heroes of Hebrew History&quot; (1870), originally contributed to &quot;Good Words&quot;.

There were several volumes of his sermons. He left a diary, and its content is considered influenced in parts by the editorial work he did on his father&#x27;s papers, while also revealing of his own emotional life. The anonymous &quot;Britannica&quot; 1911 author wrote of it that &quot;His diary reveals a tender and devout private life which has been overlooked by those who have only considered the versatile facility and persuasive expediency that marked the successful public career of the bishop, and perhaps earned him the sobriquet of &quot;Soapy Sam&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy==
Wilberforce was the patron of Philip Reginald Egerton, who founded Bloxham School in Oxfordshire. A boarding house at the school is named after Wilberforce. Together with his brother Robert, he joined the Canterbury Association on 27 March 1848. He resigned from the Canterbury Association on 14 March 1849. The Wilberforce River in New Zealand was named for them.

==Family==
Wilberforce married on 11 June 1828 Emily Sargent (1807–1841), daughter of John Sargent, and his wife Mary Smith, daughter of Abel Smith. They had five children who survived early childhood, one daughter and four sons.

* Emily Charlotte (1830–1917), the daughter, married J. Henry Pye. Pye was an Anglican priest: the couple converted to Catholicism in 1868.
* Herbert William Wilberforce (1833–1856), a lieutenant in the Royal Navy. He died at Torquay after duties in the Baltic Sea.
* Reginald Wilberforce (1838–1914), army officer. He was author of &quot;An Unrecorded Chapter of the Indian Mutiny&quot; (1894), a work criticised by fellow officers of the 52nd Foot for inaccuracy. Reginald was grandfather (through his fourth son, Samuel (Samuel Wilberforce (judge)) to Richard Lord Wilberforce, a Lord of Appeal.
* Ernest Wilberforce (1840–1908), Bishop of Newcastle-upon-Tyne from 1882 to 1895, and Bishop of Chichester from 1895 till his death. 
* Basil Wilberforce (1841–1916), appointed canon residentiary of Westminster in 1894, chaplain of the House of Commons in 1896 and Archdeacon of Westminster in 1900; he published volumes of sermons.

==In literature==
Wilberforce appears, caricatured, in Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;The Warden&quot; (1855), where he is portrayed as the third child of the Archdeacon, Dr Grantly, who is named Samuel and nicknamed Soapy, and is engaging and ingratiating but not to be trusted.
He is also referenced obliquely by John Mortimer in Rumpole of the Bailey: Rumpole calls his head of chambers &quot;Soapy Sam.&quot;

<text>Flin Flon (pop. 5,185 in 2016 census; 4,982 in Manitoba and 203 in Saskatchewan) is a mining city, located on a correction line on the border of the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, with the majority of the city located within Manitoba. Residents thus travel southwest into Saskatchewan, and northeast into Manitoba. The city is incorporated in and is jointly administered by both provinces.

==Etymology==

The town&#x27;s name is taken from the lead character in a 1905 paperback novel, &quot;The Sunless City&quot; by J. E. Preston Muddock. Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin piloted a submarine into a bottomless lake where he sailed through a hole lined with gold to enter a strange underground world. A copy of the book was allegedly found and read by prospector Tom Creighton.

When Tom Creighton discovered a high-grade exposure of copper, he thought of the book and called it Flin Flon&#x27;s mine, and the town that developed around the mine adopted the name. Flin Flon shares the distinction of being named after a character in an adventure novel with Tarzana, California and Le Plessis-Robinson, France.

The character of &quot;Flinty&quot;, as he is locally known, is of such importance to the identity of the city that in 2003, the local Chamber of Commerce commissioned the minting of a $3.00 coin which was considered legal tender amongst locally participating retailers until September 2004 and a $5.00 coin which was in circulation until December 31, 2008. A statue representing Flinty was designed by cartoonist Al Capp and is one of the points of interest of the city. In 1978, the National Film Board of Canada produced the short documentary &quot;Canada Vignettes: Flin Flon&quot; about the origin of the city&#x27;s name.

== History ==
Flin Flon was founded in 1927 by Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting (Hudbay) to exploit the large local copper and zinc ore resources. In the late 1920s, HBM&amp;S invested in a railway, mine, smelter, and a hydroelectric power plant at Island Falls, Saskatchewan. By 1928, the rail line reached the mine.

The town grew considerably during the 1930s as those impoverished by the Great Depression came to work at the mines. A significant number of farmers abandoned their farms and were among those looking for work. The municipality was incorporated on January 1, 1933, and reached city status in 1970. The city has continued to be a mining centre with the development of several mines adding to its industrial base, although its population has been in decline since the 1960s. With a scenic setting and a number of nearby lakes, Flin Flon has also become a popular tourist destination.

==Geography==
Flin Flon straddles the provincial boundary of Manitoba and Saskatchewan with the majority of the city located in Manitoba. The 2016 census reported 4,982 residents in the Manitoba portion and 203 in the Saskatchewan section; the Manitoba portion has a land area of 13.88 km2 (5.4 sq mi), while the Saskatchewan portion has a land area of 2.37 km2 (0.91 sq mi). Due to the zig-zag nature of the Saskatchewan-Manitoba boundary correction lines, the Saskatchewan section of town lies south of the Manitoba section, not west. 
Main Street crosses the provincial boundary just south of its intersection with Church Street; Hudson Street crosses the provincial boundary between its intersections with 5 Ave E. and Harrison Street, adopting the new name South Hudson Street at the point of crossing; an undeveloped stretch of Channing Drive briefly crosses into Saskatchewan before reentering Manitoba just west of the city&#x27;s rural Channing neighbourhood.

For Canada Post purposes, residents in the Saskatchewan portion of the city retain the local Manitoba R8A postal code, and often use a Flin Flon, MB address. For telephone service, however, they are located in Saskatchewan&#x27;s area code 306 as part of the Creighton telephone exchange, rather than Manitoba&#x27;s area code 204. However, residents in Saskatchewan may use either Saskatchewan&#x27;s SaskTel or Manitoba&#x27;s Bell MTS systems for cellular services. Electrical service is received from Manitoba Hydro for both the Manitoba and Saskatchewan parts of the city.

The majority of Flin Flon&#x27;s surface topology is exposed Canadian Shield bedrock, hence the nickname &quot;the city built on rock&quot;. Due to this and climatic factors, agriculture is generally not possible although grain farming is found southeast in The Pas, Manitoba, which is south of the Canadian Shield. The extensive bedrock exposure led to some interesting adaptations. In the northwestern areas of the city, there is often not enough overburden to bury water and sewer lines, so &quot;sewer boxes&quot; exist above surface to house the infrastructure. Many of these are used as ad-hoc sidewalks.

===Climate===
Flin Flon experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). There is a wide range in seasonal temperatures, with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Temperatures in January have an average low of and an average high of . Temperatures in July have an average high of and an average low of . The highest (reliable) temperature ever recorded in Flin Flon was on 19 July 1941. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 15 January 1930.


==Demographics==


In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Manitoba portion of Flin Flon had a population of 4,940 living in 2,280 of its 2,533 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 4,991. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Also in the 2021 census, the Saskatchewan portion of Flin Flon had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Transportation==
===Road===
Flin Flon is accessed by Manitoba Provincial Trunk Highway 10, Saskatchewan Highway 106 and Saskatchewan Highway 167. The city also runs a small public bus system.

===Air===

The city operates Flin Flon Airport, which is located southeast of the city, immediately west of the Bakers Narrows Provincial Park. The airport has a single asphalt runway, and has regular flights to and from Winnipeg through Calm Air. There is also an airport in nearby Channing, MB for small aircraft use.

===Rail===
The Hudson Bay Railway operates railway freight service on its railway line between The Pas and Flin Flon.

The rail line to Churchill was washed out in June 2017 and remained out of service for over a year when then-owner Omnitrax refused to repair it. The City of Flin Flon purchased shares in One North, one of the partners of purchasing consortium Arctic Gateway Group Limited Partnership. The rail line was subsequently repaired by Cando Rail Services and Paradox Access Solutions.

==Economy==

===Main employers===
Note that the number of workers with the classification of &quot;Mining&quot; will be highly variable following the June 2022 closure of the 777 mine and the planned impending closure of the majority of the Hudbay Flin Flon operations.


===Mining===

The economy of Flin Flon was primarily reliant on base metal production (primarily copper and zinc with lesser gold and silver). Since the late 1910s, approximately 17 mines have operated in the Flin Flon vicinity. The most recent mine, the 777 Mine, closed in June 2022 with decommissioning completed shortly thereafter.

Sphalerite (zinc) concentrate was produced and processed on-site to refined zinc while chalcopyrite (copper) concentrate was produced and sold for external copper production. Prior to the smelter closure in 2010, the chalcopyrite concentrate was refined on location. Although processing of any sulphide material usually emits large amounts of sulfur dioxide, the Hudbay plant uses a zinc pressure leaching (ZPL) process which greatly reduces emissions.

=== Marijuana production ===
Flin Flon gained international notoriety in 2002 when the Government of Canada awarded a four-year contract to Saskatoon-based Prairie Plant Systems for the production of medicinal marijuana. The company set up operations in a mined-out area of the then-active Trout Lake Mine, an underground copper/zinc mine located just over 5 km (3 miles) northeast of Flin Flon city limits and owned by the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company (later Hudbay) to produce approximately 400 kilograms (882 lbs) of medicinal marijuana annually. The entire operation was situated approximately 120 metres (400&#x27;) underground for security and climate control reasons.

In 2009, Prairie Plant Systems discontinued operation at the mine due to the expiry of their lease and the uncertainty regarding the pending closure of the mine, which occurred in 2011.

==Culture==

===Arts===
Flin Flon has an active local arts and culture scene. The Flin Flon Arts Council has been instrumental in building the local arts scene, and has also brought high-quality performers, such as the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, into the community for special events. The R.H. Channing Auditorium in the Flin Flon Community Hall hosts concerts and theatrical performances, including those produced by the local theatre troupe &quot;Ham Sandwich&quot;.

In 2010, the Northern Visual Arts Centre (or NorVA) was established as a studio and gallery space for local visual artists. NorVA frequently hosts workshops, concerts and other community arts-based events.

Every two years, the Flin Flon Community Choir performs a largely extravagant musical production for the community. In 2013, the Flin Flon Community Choir presented &quot;&quot;, to great acclaim. They presented &quot;Les Miserables&quot; in 2015, Grease&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Mama Mia&quot; in 2019. Past performances have included &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, and &quot;Bombertown&quot;, among many others.

Culture Days, a national festival celebrating arts and culture, is a popular event in Flin Flon. Culture Days is held on the last weekend of September each year. In 2018, Flin Flon ranked second in the country, only following Winnipeg, for the number of free events (including concerts, workshops, artist talks and kids&#x27; activities) offered to community members and visitors. Toronto followed Flin Flon with the number of events, ranking third, down from second in 2017.

Flin Flon is the fictional home of the comic book superhero Captain Canuck.

=== Petting zoo ===
The city operates the Joe Brain Petting Zoo. It is open from June through August, weather permitting. It features a picnic area, playground, basketball hoops, and a wading pool.

===Sports===

Flin Flon is the home of the Flin Flon Bombers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League and the birthplace of NHL great and Hall of Fame member Bobby Clarke. As captain of the team, he led the Philadelphia Flyers to two NHL Stanley Cup championships in the 1970s, and was a star on the 1972 Team Canada Summit Series roster. Other NHLers hailing from Flin Flon include Ken Baird, Ken Baumgartner, Matt Davidson, Kim Davis, Dean Evason, Al Hamilton, Ted Hampson (who was captain of the Flin Flon Bombers Memorial Cup team in 1957 and the second player to ever receive the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy), Gerry Hart, Ron Hutchinson, George Konik, Ray Maluta, Tom Gilmore, Dunc McCallum, Eric Nesterenko, Mel Pearson, Reid Simpson, David Struch, and Ernie Wakely.

<doc id="250843" wikidata="Q7679867" url="?curid=250843" title="Talking to Americans">
<text>Talking to Americans was a regular feature presented by Rick Mercer on the Canadian political satire show &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, which was later spun off into a one-hour special that aired on April 1, 2001 on CBC Television.

The purpose of the skit was to satirize American lack of awareness about Canada, by interviewing Americans on the street and convincing them to agree with ridiculous statements about their northern neighbour. Mercer freely acknowledged that he did not think Americans were collectively stupid; in an interview on &quot;Nightline&quot;, Mercer explained that &quot;I&#x27;m just looking for the short answer. Some people hem and haw and they seem to be on to me, and of course we don&#x27;t include them... About 80 per cent of the people give me the right answer, by which of course, I mean the wrong answer.&quot; He also acknowledged that it would be entirely possible to put together a similar feature getting Canadians to agree on camera to strange statements on topics they knew little about, with the primary difference being that Mercer couldn&#x27;t do it himself as Canadians would recognize him.

In his 2021 memoir &quot;Talking to Canadians&quot;, Mercer described the segment as having had its genesis in 1998, when he was in Washington, DC to film an unrelated segment for &quot;22 Minutes&quot;. While waiting to begin filming, he met a Capitol Hill staffer whose apparent willingness to talk freely about subjects he didn&#x27;t actually know anything about led to an impromptu filmed interview in which the staffer was asked questions about a fictional presidential summit between Bill Clinton and Ralph Benmergui, and was successfully convinced by Mercer that Canadians were unfamiliar with the concept of alphabetical order.

On shooting the segment, Mercer wrote in his memoir, “I suppose I had a nagging feeling that &#x27;Talking to Americans&#x27; was a tad unsportsmanlike. They didn’t stand a chance. It wasn’t just shooting fish in a barrel; it was more like throwing dynamite into a shallow pool. All I had to do was stand there with a net and scoop them up as they floated to the surface, completely oblivious to what was happening to them. And they just kept coming. It really was a great gig.”

== Content==
The intent was to satirize perceived American ignorance of Canada and the rest of the world. 

The topics included:
*persuading Americans to congratulate Canada on legalizing VCRs or adopting the 24-hour day (then-Governor of Iowa Tom Vilsack was fooled by this one).
*various political controversies involving one or more Canadian provinces.
*discussion of then-Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien, such as claiming that he was Canada&#x27;s first Asian Prime Minister or that he just achieved a rare political feat called a &quot;Double Double&quot; (a nickname for a cup of coffee with two scoops of sugar and two creams) in which he received support from both sides of the Canadian parliament. Mercer fooled American TV personalities David Hasselhoff and Jerry Springer into believing that Chrétien was a small-town mayor who just issued a proclamation to them, while Mercer introduced himself as a journalist named &quot;Jean Chrétien&quot; to game show host Louie Anderson, who failed to note the identity of the then-Prime Minister. In one of the feature&#x27;s most famous moments, future President George W. Bush failed to correct Mercer when he falsely referred to Chrétien as &quot;Jean Poutine&quot; (see below).
*congratulating the Canadian government on building a dome over its &quot;national igloo&quot; (apparently a downsized version of the United States Capitol made out of ice) to protect it from global warming (one of the interview subjects so fooled was then-Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, whom Mercer later stated had asked off-camera if this was a &quot;controversial igloo&quot;).
*changing the words in the Canadian Anthem and asking Americans to sing it.
*congratulating Canada for officially joining North America.
*congratulating Canada for moving the capital city from Kingston, Ontario to Toronto (the actual capital is Ottawa, and then-Vice President Al Gore failed to correct Mercer regarding Toronto being the capital).
*asking Americans for their opinions on the US bombing/invading Saskatchewan.
*asking university students and professors to sign a petition against the Saskatchewan seal hunt and the Toronto polar bear hunt.
*asking Americans to condemn Canada&#x27;s practice of euthanizing senior citizens by setting them adrift on Northern ice floes.
*asking Americans how many states Canada has (Canada has provinces and territories, not states).
*saying that global warming is causing Canada&#x27;s polar ice caps to melt and break in two, resulting in a bipolar Canada, and that the two polar caps can be joined back together with the use of tugboats. He further asks if America would assist in curing bipolar Canada with the use of tugboats, and that Canada will be using a big tugboat named Theodore.
*convincing tourists at Mount Rushmore that the mineral rights to the mountain had been sold to a Canadian firm, and that this firm was getting ready to drill for oil in Lincoln&#x27;s forehead. Alternatively, he would ask their opinion on a plan to expand the monument to include sculptures of Richard Nixon and Brian Mulroney; interviewees all failed to note that the latter was a Canadian Prime Minister, not a US President.
*convincing Americans that the new wooden textured Canadian 5 dollar coin will be named the &quot;woody&quot; (a satirical spin on the &quot;Toonie&quot; two-dollar coin and the &quot;Loonie&quot; one-dollar coin), a play on the common slang term for an erection.

Professors at Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Berkeley, New York University and Stanford University were consistently fooled by absurdities such as the &quot;Saskatchewan seal hunt&quot;. The only Americans who were shown outsmarting Mercer were: a university student who spent her time laughing at him (before finally answering), and a small child who pointed out to his mother, who was also tricked, that Canada had provinces, not states.

==George W. Bush==
The most famous segment, aired in 2000, featured Mercer asking then-presidential candidate George W. Bush – who had previously stated that &quot;you can&#x27;t stump me on world leaders&quot; – for his reaction to an endorsement by Canadian Prime Minister &quot;Jean Poutine&quot;, which was a play on the name of then-Prime Minister Jean Chrétien (poutine is an order of French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy).

Bush said he looked forward to working together with his future counterpart to the north, praising free trade and Canada. That said, Bush never actually used the name of Poutine and only failed to correct Mercer on the name.

A few years later, when Bush made his first official visit to Canada, he joked during a speech, &quot;There&#x27;s a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him for that endorsement. I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine.&quot;

==2001 special==
The special was a co-production between Island Edge (Rick Mercer&#x27;s production company) and Salter Street Films (at the time the producer of &quot;22 Minutes&quot;). It was produced and directed by Geoff D&#x27;Eon, who also produced and directed the segments for &quot;22 Minutes&quot;. It used both previously broadcast clips from &quot;22 Minutes&quot;, and new material shot exclusively for the special. 

&quot;Talking to Americans&quot; attracted 2.7 million Canadian viewers, making it the highest-rated special on Canadian television that year.

The show received two Gemini Award nominations at the 16th Gemini Awards in 2001, for Best Music or Variety Program or Series and Best Host in a Variety Program or Series. However, Mercer thought it was inappropriate to make fun of American-Canadian relations so soon after the September 11 attacks, and requested that the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television pull the nominations.

<text>Ernest Lavisse (; 17 December 184218 August 1922) was a French historian. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times. Lavisse is also known for being one of the main creator of the &quot;roman national&quot; (&quot;National myth&quot;, lit. &quot;national novel&quot;), thanks to his history schoolbooks.

== Biography ==
He was born at Le Nouvion-en-Thiérache, Aisne.
In 1865 he obtained a fellowship in history, and in 1875 became a doctor of letters; he was appointed &quot;maître de conférence&quot; (1876) at the École Normale Supérieure, succeeding Fustel de Coulanges, and then professor of modern history at the Sorbonne (1888), in the place of Henri Wallon. He was an eloquent professor and very fond of young people, and played an important part in the revival of higher studies in France after 1871. His learning was displayed in his public lectures and his addresses, in his private lessons, where he taught a small number of pupils the historical method, and in his books, where he wrote &quot;ad probandum&quot; at least as much as &quot;ad narrandum&quot;: class-books, collections of articles, intermingled with personal reminiscences (&quot;Questions d&#x27;enseignement national&quot;, 1885; &quot;Etudes et étudiants&quot;, 1890; &quot;A propos de nos écoles&quot;, 1895), rough historical sketches (&quot;Vue générale de l&#x27;histoire politique de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, 1890), etc. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, his works of learning are lucid and vivid.

After the Franco-Prussian War Lavisse studied the development of Prussia and wrote &quot;Etude sur l&#x27;une des origines de la monarchie prussienne, ou la Marche de Brandebourg sous la dynastie ascanienne&quot;, which was his thesis for his doctor&#x27;s degree, and &quot;Études sur l&#x27;histoire de la Prusse&quot; (1879). In connection with his study of the Holy Roman Empire, and the cause of its decline, he wrote a number of articles which were published in the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;, and he wrote &quot;Trois empereurs d&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (1888), &quot;La Jeunesse du grand Frédéric&quot; (1891) and &quot;Frédéric II. avant son avènement&quot; (1893) when studying the modern German empire and the grounds for its strength. With his friend Alfred Rambaud he conceived the plan of &quot;L&#x27;Histoire générale du IVe siècle à nos jours&quot;, to which, however, he contributed nothing.

He edited the &quot;Histoire de France depuis les origines jusqu&#x27;à la Révolution&quot; (1900–1912), in which he carefully revised the work of his numerous assistants, reserving the greatest part of the reign of Louis XIV for himself. This section occupies the whole of volume VII. Lavisse was admitted to the Académie Française on the death of Admiral Jurien de la Gravière in 1892, and after the death of James Darmesteter became editor of the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;. He is, however, chiefly a master of pedagogy. When the école normale was joined to the university of Paris, Lavisse was appointed director of the new organization, which he had helped more than any one to bring about. After World War I, he edited the &quot;Histoire contemporaine de la France&quot; (1920–1922).

<doc id="250846" wikidata="Q880319" url="?curid=250846" title="Henry Hastings Sibley">
<text>Henry Hastings Sibley (February 20, 1811 – February 18, 1891) was a fur trader with the American Fur Company, the first U.S. Congressional representative for Minnesota Territory, the first governor of the state of Minnesota, and a U.S. military leader in the Dakota War of 1862 and a subsequent expedition into Dakota Territory in 1863.

Numerous places are named after him, including Sibley County, Minnesota; Sibley, North Dakota; Sibley, Iowa; Hastings, Minnesota; Sibley Memorial Highway; General Sibley Park and Sibley State Park.

==Early life and education==

Henry Hastings Sibley was born in Detroit, Michigan Territory. His father, Solomon Sibley (1769–1846), was from Sutton, Massachusetts, and a direct descendant of John Sibley, who had immigrated from England to America in 1629. Solomon had moved to Detroit from Marietta, Ohio, in 1798.

Henry&#x27;s mother, born Sarah Whipple Sproat, was the only daughter of Colonel Ebenezer Sproat, a distinguished officer in the Continental Army, and the granddaughter of Commodore Abraham Whipple of the Continental Navy. Both Sproat and Whipple had received land grants after they lost their fortunes in the American Revolutionary War and were early pioneers in Marietta, Ohio. Sarah was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and attended boarding schools in Bethlehem and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She married Solomon Sibley in Marietta in 1802 at the age of twenty, after which she moved to Detroit.

Henry was the fourth of eight children and second son of Solomon and Sarah Sibley. During the War of 1812, when Henry was just 18 months old, Fort Detroit was surrounded by forces led by British Major General Isaac Brock and Shawnee chief Tecumseh. According to the Daughters of the American Revolution, Sarah Sibley and her children had been placed inside the fort for safety with other families, while Solomon was out in the field commanding a company of militia. Mrs. Sibley was found holding baby Henry in her arms &quot;while with her busy hands she was making cartridges for the soldiers,&quot; and four officers, including her cousin, were killed by a cannonball in the adjoining room. After American General William Hull surrendered and Detroit was occupied by the British, Solomon Sibley secured permission to leave. The family then left their home with only a few belongings, traveling &quot;by a dim trail through the forests from Detroit to Marietta, camping out most of the way.&quot; They returned to Detroit one year later after its recapture by U.S. General William Henry Harrison and his defeat of the British in the Battle of the Thames.

As a boy, Henry Sibley was educated at the Academy of Detroit, after which he was tutored privately in Latin and Greek for two years by Reverend Richard Fish Cadle, an Episcopal clergyman and classics scholar. Around the age of sixteen, Henry started studying law, because Judge Sibley had hoped that his son would follow in his footsteps. After two years, Henry confessed to his father that he found the study of law &quot;irksome&quot; and that he &quot;longed for a more active and stirring life.&quot; His parents finally agreed to allow Henry to pursue a career of his own choosing.

==Entry into fur trade==

On June 20, 1828, at the age of seventeen, Henry H. Sibley left Detroit for Sault Ste. Marie, a prominent fur trading center on both the United States and Canadian sides. His first job was as a clerk working for John Hulbert, whose sutler&#x27;s store supplied four companies of the U.S. 5th Infantry Regiment, which were garrisoned there. After a few months, he agreed to work as an agent for Susan Johnston, the widow of John Johnston, a Scots-Irish fur trader who had died that year. Mrs. Johnston, also known as Ozhaguscodaywayquay (Woman of the Green Glade), was the daughter of Ojibwe warrior and chief Waubojeeg; mother of three daughters including Native American literary writer Jane Johnston Schoolcraft; and mother-in-law of Henry Schoolcraft, a U.S. Indian agent who later became a well-known ethnologist of Native American tribes in the United States.

In the spring of 1829, Sibley entered into an apprenticeship as a clerk and storekeeper for the American Fur Company (AFC) in Mackinac (then known as Michilimackinac). He returned to Detroit to work at the Bank of Michigan during the winter, and then signed a five-year contract with American Fur Company after working there again in the summer of 1830. In 1832, AFC manager Robert Stuart selected Sibley to transact important business for the company, and sent him on a perilous journey back to Detroit in a bark canoe paddled by nine voyageurs. Despite a severe storm, damage to the canoe, and news of a cholera outbreak in Detroit which killed his grandmother, Sibley successfully completed the journey and secured several licenses for the American Fur Company from Michigan Territorial Governor George Bryan Porter. From 1832 to 1833 and again from 1833 to 1834, Sibley was charged with the responsibility of buying supplies for the company via its offices in Cleveland, which required him to canvass rural Ohio and Pennsylvania on horseback in winter.

In 1834, as American Fur Company founder John Jacob Astor prepared to retire, the company was in the midst of reorganization as a partnership, with Astor&#x27;s chief lieutenant Ramsay Crooks as president and senior partner. Sibley approached Crooks directly and asked to be released from his employment contract with Astor, which ran until 1835, one year early. He explained that his parents &quot;were strongly opposed to [his] longer sojourn in what was little better than a wild Indian country,&quot; and that he had been offered much better paying positions as a cashier at two banks, including one in Detroit. However, Crooks rejected Sibley&#x27;s offer to pay US$1,000 to be released from his contract. Instead, his counteroffer was to include Sibley as a junior partner in the American Fur Company&#x27;s newly constituted Western Outfit, together with Jean Joseph Rolette and Hercules L. Dousman, who had been running the company&#x27;s Upper Mississippi Outfit. Sibley would be the regional manager for fur trade with the Dakota north and west of Lake Pepin, based at the mouth of the Minnesota River (then called St. Peter&#x27;s). Sibley later wrote that he was finally persuaded by Dousman&#x27;s glowing description of the Minnesota Valley as a hunter&#x27;s paradise where &quot;woods abounded with bear, deer and other game animals, and the numerous lakes with aquatic fowl of every variety.&quot;

== Fur trade in Minnesota country ==
In October 1834, 23-year-old Henry Sibley left Mackinac, traveling to Green Bay and up the Fox River, then to the Wisconsin River via a two-mile portage trail. On the Wisconsin River, he found a tiny stern-wheel steamboat which took him to Prairie du Chien. After spending several days at the American Fur Company&#x27;s Western Outfit headquarters at Prairie du Chien, Sibley traveled the remaining 300 miles of wilderness by horseback. According to his letter to company president Ramsay Crooks dated November 1, Sibley finally arrived in St. Peters (now known as Mendota, Minnesota) on October 28, 1834.{{Rp|353}} During his journey to St. Peters, Sibley was accompanied by Alexis Bailly, whose four trading posts Sibley would take over as head of the company&#x27;s &quot;Sioux Outfit&quot; the following year. They spent six months together, during which Bailly warned Sibley that &quot;the American Fur Company squeezed its small traders dry then dropped them like useless rinds.&quot;

=== American Fur Company &quot;Sioux Outfit&quot; ===

Henry Sibley officially took over as head of the American Fur Company&#x27;s Sioux Outfit in 1835 at the age of 24. The Sioux Outfit was headquartered at St. Peters (now Mendota). The main store in St. Peters served five nearby Mdewakanton Dakota villages, the &quot;mixed-blood&quot; community around Fort Snelling, and groups of Dakota coming from the Cannon and Cedar River valleys to the southwest. Sibley also managed three distant posts at Traverse des Sioux, Lake Traverse, and a third location serving the Sisseton Dakota between the headwaters of the Des Moines and Big Sioux Rivers; these posts were staffed by hired clerks. In addition, the Sioux Outfit had two independent subsidiary traders, including Jean-Baptiste Faribault, Alexis Bailly&#x27;s father-in-law, who ran a post at Little Rapids (near present-day Chaska), and Joseph Renville, who ran a trading post at Lac qui Parle on the Upper Minnesota River.{{Rp|47}}

Sibley had arrived in the fur traders&#x27; &quot;frontier&quot; with a sense of adventure, hoping to earn a quick fortune before triumphantly returning to &quot;civilization.&quot; Unfortunately for Sibley, as Bailly had warned, it had already become difficult for traders to turn a profit through the traditional fur trade.{{Rp|128}} Nevertheless, Sibley worked diligently to try to maximize profits, and according to American Fur Company records, the fur trade in Minnesota &quot;was in its most flourishing condition&quot; in the years leading up to 1837.

Whereas fur traders such as Joseph Renville and Hazen Mooers had traditionally rewarded loyal Dakota hunters with generous gift-giving and access to credit, Sibley &quot;sought to transform the fur trade into a completely modern business.&quot;{{Rp|140}} He instructed the traders and clerks in his territory to limit credits to powder, lead and shot. Many Dakota hunters complained to Indian agent Lawrence Taliaferro about these changes. Hunters from Shakopee&#x27;s band reported that ever since Sibley had taken over, &quot;they could get &#x27;nothing&#x27; from their traders, &#x27;not even a flint much less traps &amp; ammunition.&#x27;&quot;{{Rp|141}}

Sibley removed Hazen Mooers, a fur trader who was popular with Sisseton, Wahpeton and Yankton hunters, from his trading post at Lake Traverse which he had run for over 20 years.{{Rp|141}} By the fall of 1835, Sibley and Jean Joseph Rolette had replaced Mooers with Joseph R. Brown, a fur trader who had previously quarreled with Agent Taliaferro for hauling whiskey and owed money to Rolette and the Western Outfit.{{Rp|57}} Sibley was also reportedly concerned about the power and influence of mixed-blood trader Joseph Renville, who had his own stockade and soldiers&#x27; lodge at Lac qui Parle, and asked Brown to keep an eye on him.{{Rp|8}}

The steady decline in the wild animal population in the region meant that more and more hunters were competing for scarcer game, and driving herds further north. By 1836, the Sisseton and Wahpeton Dakota had become more protective of their hunting zones, even refusing access to the Mdewakanton Dakota, who had been hardest hit and now depended entirely on the western hunting grounds. Sibley, whose business relied heavily on collecting furs from the Mdewakantons, made an emergency trip to Traverse des Sioux to broker a solution. He threatened to withdraw all American Fur Company men if the Sissetons and Wahpetons did not allow the Mdewakantons to hunt there.{{Rp|142–143}}
=== Government contracts ===
Sibley worked to secure government contracts for the American Fur Company, in part to eliminate potential competition. From 1836 to 1839, Sibley was in charge of operating the army sutler&#x27;s store at Fort Snelling, in partnership with Pennsylvania newspaper editor and former Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who had been appointed to the post but had no interest in moving there. By controlling the army sutler&#x27;s store, the fur traders were confident that they could maintain their local monopoly; otherwise, there would be nothing to stop the Dakota from patronizing the sutler&#x27;s store at Fort Snelling and using fur pelts to pay for goods. Any losses incurred by the traders would be more than offset by the higher prices they could charge the Dakota. However, the sutler&#x27;s store proved to be a headache for Henry Sibley, who did not get along with Stambaugh. Business was also highly dependent on the number of troops garrisoned at Fort Snelling. By 1837, the garrison was drastically reduced due to the Second Seminole War in Florida Territory, and many soldiers in the First Infantry Regiment left the fort with unpaid credits.{{Rp|51}}

In 1835, Sibley started lobbying for the establishment of a post office at Fort Snelling with regular service from Prairie du Chien, contacting his political connections in Michigan Territory for support. He succeeded, and the American Fur Company&#x27;s Western Outfit secured the contract for mail delivery from 1837 to 1839. Mail was carried by steamboats during the summer, but during the long winter, Sibley and his partners had to hire runners, and found it difficult to deliver the mail on time.{{Rp|51–52}}

=== Land cession treaties of 1837 ===
The financial panic of 1837 nearly resulted in a collapse of the U.S. banking and monetary system, triggering an economic depression which lasted until the mid-1840s. Fur prices fell sharply and muskrat pelts, which made up the bulk of the fur trade in Sibley&#x27;s region, were no longer in demand. By February 1838, Crooks reported to Sibley that the previous year&#x27;s pelts were still sitting in a New York warehouse, and had become essentially worthless. The partners of the American Fur Company were on the brink of financial ruin.{{Rp|66}}

However, in the summer and fall of 1837, the United States government signed three major treaties with the Ojibwe, Dakota and Winnebago tribes, in which they agreed to give up all their lands east of the Mississippi River in return for compensation. Sibley and the American Fur Company partners aimed to collect payment from the government to cover a substantial portion of their business losses, which appeared on their books as &quot;Indian debts.&quot;{{Rp|66}} In December 1836, Sibley had written to American Fur Company president Ramsay Crooks urging him to lobby his Washington connections to prevent Indian agent Lawrence Taliaferro, a long-time political enemy of the traders, from being appointed as treaty commissioner the following year. Taliaferro nevertheless prevailed.{{Rp|133}}

On July 29, 1837, Henry Sibley was a signatory to the U.S. treaty with the Ojibwe, also known as the Treaty of St. Peters, the Treaty with the Chippewa, or the &quot;White Pine Treaty&quot;. The Ojibwe treaty named his business partner Hercules L. Dousman as one of three fur traders to receive debt payments.

Agent Taliaferro, infuriated by what he viewed as trader meddling when the Ojibwe treaty was signed at Fort Snelling, moved the Mdewakanton Dakota treaty negotiations to Washington, D.C.{{Rp|134}} On August 18, Taliaferro managed to leave the St. Peter&#x27;s Indian Agency with twenty-six Mdewakanton chiefs and headmen on a steamboat without tipping off the traders and without telling the chiefs the real reason for the trip. Soon after their departure, however, Taliaferro&#x27;s covert operation was discovered, and nearly a dozen traders, including Henry Sibley and Joseph R. Brown, arrived in Washington close behind them. It was Sibley&#x27;s first time in Washington.{{Rp|66}} In early September, Hercules Dousman wrote to Sibley, instructing him &quot;leave no stone unturned to get something handsome for us&quot; when the U.S. government was negotiating with the Dakota. However, Taliaferro prevented most of the American Fur Company traders from entering the room where discussions took place between Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett, Commissioner Carey A. Harris, and the Mdewakanton chiefs, starting September 21. Only &quot;mixed-blood&quot; American Fur employee Alexander Faribault and former AFC trader Alexis Bailly were allowed in the meetings as staff assistants who could also serve as interpreters.

On September 29, 1837, twenty-one Mdewakanton leaders and representatives of the U.S. government signed the &quot;Treaty with the Sioux.&quot; The Mdewakanton gave up &quot;all their land, east of the Mississippi river, and all their islands in the said river&quot; to the United States for $16,000 in cash and goods up front, plus an annual distribution worth up to $40,000 per year. Meanwhile, mixed-blood &quot;relatives and friends&quot; would receive $110,000 up front (because they were ineligible for annuities), and $90,000 would be paid to the traders to settle Mdewakanton debts – a little more than one-third of the debts they had claimed.{{Rp|66}} Sibley wrote to Ramsay Crooks that the whole treaty was &quot;but one series of iniquity and wrong,&quot; which had left Faribault and Bailly &quot;so exasperated, that they seriously considered traveling home without the delegation... This is the boasted paternal regard for the poor Indian. &#x27;O Shame where is thy blush!&quot; Historian Gary Clayton Anderson writes that &quot;Self-interest on their part underlay this opposition: the traders wanted the government to spend more money.&quot; Sibley was also irritated that the treaty named Taliaferro&#x27;s interpreter, Scott Campbell, as an annuity recipient with title to part of the land then occupied by Sibley&#x27;s trading establishment — a personal concession which was later struck out by the United States Congress.

On November 1, 1837, Henry Sibley was a signatory to the Treaty with the Winnebago, also negotiated in Washington. The treaty was potentially the most lucrative for the American Fur Company, with $200,000 set aside for individual compensation and settlement of &quot;debts of the nation&quot; to traders. The traders were &quot;jubilant&quot; over the terms of the treaty, and Sibley wrote to his father saying that once his debts were paid, he hoped to end his relationship with American Fur and return to Detroit the following year.{{Rp|137}}

=== Aftermath of 1837 treaties ===
It took many months for the treaties to be ratified by the U.S. Congress, which was reluctant to approve the treaty expenditures in the midst of an economic depression.{{Rp|135}} Special commissioners were appointed to examine the books of each claimant and allocate funds. Disputes also arose among American Fur Company traders, complicated by the fact that some debts had been incurred before the company reorganized in 1834.{{Rp|67}}

Even before the treaties were ratified, however, the area around the Upper Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers changed quickly. Hundreds of timber speculators and squatters began moving into the area, also on land that still belonged to the Dakota, causing Chief Big Thunder Little Crow to complain to Agent Taliaferro that the influx of squatters seemed &quot;hasty&quot; and premature.{{Rp|135}} Meanwhile, many Mdewakanton, convinced that the promised payments and provisions would soon arrive, refused to join the winter hunt and insisted that all past debts to traders had been settled by the treaty. In December 1837, Hercules Dousman complained to Henry Sibley that the Mdewakanton &quot;say it is not necessary to work for the traders anymore as they will now have plenty to live on independent of the traders&#x27; goods.&quot; Tensions in the region grew to unprecedented levels as the funds and supplies failed to arrive, and many eastern Ojibwe and Dakota faced near starvation. In April 1838, couriers from Lake Traverse informed Sibley that angry Sisseton and Wahpeton had assaulted several American Fur Company traders, killing Louis Provencalle Jr., wounding Joseph R. Brown, and killing and stealing horses and oxen. Sibley retaliated immediately by closing all trading posts west of Fort Renville on Lac qui Parle.{{Rp|67}}

The treaties were finally ratified in June 1838, but it would take many more months before payments reached the traders and the Native American tribes. Hearings on the Winnebago claims in particular dragged on through 1839, mired in public scandal and charges of corruption.{{Rp|67–68}} In November 1839, the Western Outfit partners including Henry Sibley agreed with Ramsay Crooks to extend their original contract with American Fur Company for another year, until August 1, 1841.{{Rp|68}}

On August 1, 1842, the American Fur Company sold its interest in the Western Outfit to Pierre Chouteau Jr. and Company.{{Rp|84}} The American Fur Company declared bankruptcy on September 10, 1842. Independent of American Fur, Sibley was subject to fewer restrictions and was able to trade freely with both the Ojibwe and the Dakota.{{Rp|85, 88}}

==Marriage and family==
When Henry Sibley first arrived in St. Peters (in present-day Mendota, Minnesota) on October 28, 1834, he was &quot;struck with the picturesque beauty of the scene&quot; looking out at Fort Snelling perched high above the junction of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. However, as he descended the hill, he was &quot;disappointed to find only a group of log huts&quot; occupied by the fur traders and staff, and included an urgent request for new buildings in his first letter to Ramsay Crooks on November 1. Sibley stayed at the largest log house, which belonged to Alexis Bailly, whose business Sibley took over the following year.
=== Home in Saint Peters (Mendota) ===
In 1836, Sibley hired John Mueller to start building work in St. Peters at what is now known as the Sibley House Historic Site. The Sibley House has historically been referred to as &quot;the oldest stone house in Minnesota.&quot; The first new building built by Sibley was actually a stone warehouse, completed in 1836.{{Rp|242}} Work on his actual residence most likely started in 1837 or 1838 and may not have been fully completed until 1839. Immediately following his marriage to Sarah Jane Steele and well into the 1850s, Henry Sibley began a series of alterations to his house to accommodate his growing family and transform it from a hunting lodge into a Victorian family home.{{Rp|89–90}}

During his bachelor years, Sibley hosted many famous travelers in his home, including French geographer Joseph Nicollet, who spent the winter of 1836–37 with Sibley. Over the years, questions have been raised as to whether Sibley&#x27;s cook, Joe Robinson, was a slave or a free man. Evidence suggests that if Robinson was in fact a slave at this time, he belonged to Hercules L. Dousman and may have been &quot;on loan&quot; to Sibley.{{Rp|242}}

Sibley famously wrote, &quot;It may seem paradoxical, but it is nevertheless true, that I was successively a citizen of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota Territories, without changing my residence at Mendota.&quot; Until 1857, the site of Sibley&#x27;s home and the community around it were technically part of the Fort Snelling military reservation.{{Rp|155}} Henry Sibley lived with his family in Mendota until 1862, when he sold his home to St. Peters Catholic Parish and moved to St. Paul.

=== Relationship with Red Blanket Woman ===
During the winter of 1840–41, Sibley entered a relationship with Red Blanket Woman (Tahshinahohindoway), daughter of Bad Hail (Wasuwicaxtaxni), a Mdewakanton sub-chief, and of partly French descent. They were part of a hunting expedition to the Red Cedar, which included 150 Dakota men and their families, as well as mixed-blood fur trader Alexander Faribault. While the details of their relationship are obscure, most accounts suggest that Sibley and Red Blanket Woman were married &quot;in the Dakota manner&quot; before or during the hunting trip.{{Rp|30–33}} There has also been considerable speculation that Bad Hail had actively sought to establish kinship ties with Sibley for some time. In the final page of his unfinished autobiography, Sibley recounted that &quot;an Indian sub-chief&quot; had brought his daughter to his log house in the middle of the night for protection during the winter of 1835–36. Sibley wrote that he had declined to take her in as his wife, and that the two visitors had left his house &quot;disappointed, and mortified, at the ill success of their mission.&quot; Although Sibley did not specify whether that man was Bad Hail, researcher Bruce A. Kohn states that it may well have been.{{Rp|24}}

On August 28, 1841, Red Blanket Woman gave birth to their daughter Helen Hastings Sibley, also known as Wakiye (Bird). Monsignor Augustin Ravoux, a Catholic missionary, baptized &quot;Hélène,&quot; daughter of Tahshinahohindoway and an unnamed father, with fur trader William Henry Forbes named as her godfather.{{Rp|37}} In February 1842, Forbes sent a cryptic update to Sibley, who was in Washington, apparently about Red Blanket Woman and the baby. The evidence is unclear as to how long Red Blanket Woman lived in the area. Some sources suggest that Tahshinahohindoway remarried a Dakota man, perhaps in 1842, and died in early 1843. However, trading post records show that Tahshinahohindoway had made purchases of blankets, clothing and other items as late as 1846.{{Rp|43}}

=== Marriage to Sarah Jane Steele ===
On May 2, 1843, Henry Sibley married Sarah Jane Steele, the 20-year-old sister of Franklin Steele, an entrepreneur from Pennsylvania who had staked the first claim to the east bank of the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls and had operated the sutler&#x27;s store at Fort Snelling since 1839.{{Rp|78–79}} Sarah Jane was the eldest daughter of James Steele, who had served as Inspector General of Pennsylvania Troops during the War of 1812 and as a legislator in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and built a paper- and cotton-milling business with one of his brothers.{{Rp|39}} Her three sisters eventually moved west with their mother following the death of their father in 1845. In 1847, her sister Abbian Steele married Dr. Thomas R. Potts of Galena, Illinois, and moved with him to Saint Paul, Minnesota, where Potts became one of the town&#x27;s first physicians, its first mayor, and a close friend of Henry Sibley.{{Rp|88}}

From 1856 until her death in 1869, Sarah Jane Sibley served on the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association as Vice Regent in charge of fundraising in Minnesota. She appointed roughly two dozen &quot;lady managers&quot; to assist fundraising efforts for the historical preservation of Mount Vernon, including Mary LeDuc and Rebecca Flandreau, who would succeed her. In an effort to transcend political divisions, Sarah Jane established a male advisory board including Henry Sibley&#x27;s bitter enemy within the Democratic Party, Daniel A. Robertson, along with future Republican state legislator John B. Sanborn and future governor Henry A. Swift. The advisory board also included many of Henry Sibley&#x27;s business contacts such as Richard Chute, Alexis Bailly and Martin McLeod, and family friends such as John S. Prince and William Gates LeDuc.

In her later years, Sarah Jane suffered from recurring pleurisy and pregnancies, which kept her confined to bed for much of the time. In July 1859, she sent MVLA Regent Ann Pamela Cunningham a letter of resignation which was declined. In 1860, Henry also wrote to Cunningham on Sarah&#x27;s behalf, but his plea to allow her to resign due to ill health was ignored. In 1862, the Sibley family moved to their new home at 417 Woodward Street in St. Paul – a move that Sarah had longed for during many years but reportedly was unable to enjoy due to depression and illness. Sarah Jane Sibley died of complications from pneumonia on May 21, 1869, at the age of 46.{{Rp|210–212}}

=== Relationship with daughter Helen ===
When Helen was about six years old, Henry Sibley arranged to have Helen adopted by William Reynolds Brown, an Anglo-American farmer, and his wife Martha. They had both worked at the Methodist mission in Kaposia — William as a carpenter and Martha as a teacher.{{Rp|43}} Martha Brown reported that Helen spoke French when she came to live with them, suggesting that she learned the language from her Mdewakanton family and relatives. Sibley provided for his daughter financially, paying the Browns to support Helen, and financed her education, including boarding school in the eastern U.S. As a young woman living in St. Paul, she was said to be fully acculturated and accepted by white society, with a considerable income as a result of Sibley&#x27;s investment of her treaty annuities.

Henry Sibley maintained a congenial and public relationship with Helen, although this reportedly upset his wife Sarah Jane; Henry&#x27;s past relationship with Helen&#x27;s mother fueled criticism in Republican newspapers, which questioned his character and called him a &quot;Moccasin Democrat.&quot; Henry and Helen were often seen chatting at his picket-fence gate. On September 1, 1858, they were both very prominent in a St. Paul parade celebrating the laying of the transatlantic cable in September 1858, where Helen was one of 33 young women selected to represent the states of the Union. &quot;The Daily Minnesotian&quot; identified Miss Delaware as &quot;Helen Sibley&quot; with no further comment.{{Rp|136}}

In 1859, Helen married Sylvester Sawyer, an Anglo-American doctor, and was given away by Governor Sibley at her wedding in the front parlor of the Browns&#x27; house in St. Paul. They agreed that Helen would not use Sibley as her surname on the couple&#x27;s marriage certificate, but Henry signed the certificate &quot;H.H. Sibley&quot; as a witness. Helen died less than a year later of scarlet fever after giving birth to a baby girl who also died. In 1860, Sawyer wrote that Governor Sibley mourned the loss of his first-born child Helen &quot;sincerely and truly.&quot;

=== Other children ===
Henry and Sarah Jane Sibley had at least nine children, four of whom survived until adulthood, including Augusta Ann, born in 1844; Sarah Jane, born in 1851; Charles Frederic, born in 1860; and Alfred Brush, born in 1866. Five died as young children: Henry Hastings (1846), Henry Hastings (1847–51), Franklin Steele (1853–63), Mary Steele (1855–63), and Alexander Hastings (1864).

In 1868, their eldest daughter Augusta married Captain Douglas Pope, Sibley&#x27;s former aide-de-camp who had been based at Fort Snelling. When his wife Sarah died in 1869, Henry was left with two young sons, including Freddie who was eight years old and Allie who was not yet three, as well as 18-year-old Sallie (Sarah Jane).{{Rp|211–212}} Sallie married Elbert A. Young, a Saint Paul wholesale merchant, in 1875.{{Rp|228}}

Henry Sibley did not remarry, but his sister-in-law Abbie Potts helped to take care of the boys and served as his housekeeper and hostess, and in later years as his nurse. After Douglas Pope died suddenly in 1880, Sibley&#x27;s daughter Augusta (Gussie) moved into his house in St. Paul with her three daughters.{{Rp|227–228}}

== Other business ventures ==
In the years after the 1837 treaties were signed, the fur trade itself changed significantly. In local parlance, it became known as the &quot;Indian trade,&quot; reflecting the industry&#x27;s increasing reliance on U.S. government annuities paid to, or on behalf of, the Native American tribes in the region. The growing white population in the Upper Mississippi — including lumbermen, speculators and farmers — also spurred the growth of the general mercantile trade.

Henry Sibley sought to diversify his own business activities into other areas, even as he worked for American Fur Company and later for Pierre Chouteau Jr. and Company. However, Sibley never achieved great commercial success as an entrepreneur, and would later lament his &quot;want of success in business.&quot;{{Rp|99–101}}

=== Timber and sawmill business ===
As early as 1837, Sibley, together with traders William Aitken and Lyman Warren, had entered into an exclusive contract with the Ojibwe of St. Croix valley to cut timber along the Upper St. Croix and Snake Rivers.{{Rp|100}} Under the terms of the contract, the 47 Ojibwe signatories agreed not to harass any lumbermen working for the three traders. In return, the traders would provide specified goods to the Ojibwe, including gunpowder, lead, scalping knives and tobacco, every year for ten years. After the contract was superseded by the White Pine Treaty of 1837, Sibley and Warren joined with Hercules L. Dousman in building a sawmill at Chippewa Falls. The Chippewa Mills went into operation in 1840 but was sold in 1845, much to the relief of Dousman.

=== Steamboat investments ===
In the 1840s, Hercules Dousman became interested in the steamboat industry and often bought shares in boats on behalf of Henry Sibley as well as himself. In 1844, Sibley acquired one-eighth of a steamboat called the &quot;Lynx,&quot; which was half-owned by Dousman. Although the Lynx netted only $161.04 during the 1844 season after deducting losses due to damage to the boat, in 1845, the Lynx netted $11,194.73. However, there were delays in collecting payment from shippers, leading Captain John Atchison to delay paying dividends to investors. Frustrated, Dousman put considerable pressure on Sibley over several months to make a &quot;final settlement&quot; with Atchison.

In 1847, Dousman and Sibley, together with Henry Mower Rice, Bernard Brisbois and others, purchased shares in a packet company with steamboats running on a regular schedule between Galena, Illinois and ports in Minnesota. The first boat of the Galena Packet Company, the &quot;Argo,&quot; sank in October 1847, but its new boat, the &quot;Dr. Franklin,&quot; launched successfully in 1848.

=== General merchandise store ===
In 1844, Sibley contracted with David Faribault to open a general merchandise store in Saint Paul, which was initially independent of Pierre Chouteau Jr. and Company. Because cash was scarce, many customers including white settlers paid for goods with fur pelts and deerskins. From 1847, the store was managed by William Henry Forbes. Business grew as the population of lumbermen and metal prospectors increased steadily east of the Mississippi River. Sibley also opened the first general store in Mendota together with his clerk and business partner Hypolite Dupuis.
=== Trade with the Métis and Ojibwe ===
In 1842, the American Fur Company&#x27;s Western Outfit was sold to Pierre Choteau Jr. and Company, forming their new Upper Mississippi Outfit. In the original contract, the Upper Mississippi Outfits&#x27;s trade was described as &quot;trade with whites and Indians,&quot; reflecting the changing demographics of the region. As part of Choteau Company, Henry Sibley was no longer bound by the American Fur Company&#x27;s agreement with the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to refrain from trading along the border with Canada.{{Rp|91}} In response to market demand, Sibley also shifted his focus to trading for buffalo robes.{{Rp|92}}

In 1842, Sibley briefly entered into a secret arrangement with Franklin Steele and Norman Kittson allowing them to conduct trade on a cash basis at Coldwater and up the Minnesota River at Little Rapids, Traverse des Sioux, and Lac qui Parle, even though this brought them into direct competition with Sibley&#x27;s own traders including Jean-Baptiste Faribault and Joseph Renville. In the spring of 1843, Sibley entered into an agreement with Norman Kittson, in which Kittson would run all of the Upper Mississippi Outfit&#x27;s western business. Kittson was tasked with supervising Renville at Lac qui Parle, building a new post at Big Stone Lake, and sending traders out along the Sheyenne River and the upper James River.{{Rp|92}}

In 1844, Kittson started building a trading post at Pembina, which would allow Sibley&#x27;s Upper Mississippi Outfit to trade with the Ojibwe and the Métis. Many Métis and Ojibwe hunters from the north were willing to make illegal trips across the international border to get higher prices for their fur pelts than what the British would pay. From Pembina, Kittson sent large trains of carts along the &quot;Plains Trail&quot; west of the Red River and down the Minnesota valley, well-defended against possible attacks by Dakota hunters who were resentful of the whole slaughter of buffalo by the Métis and had threatened to stop any goods from going across their country to the north.{{Rp|93–94}}

After the death of Joseph Renville in 1846, young Canadian fur trader Martin McLeod took responsibility for trade at Lac qui Parle, Big Stone Lake, and further west on the Dakota plains, freeing Kittson from having to collect furs there. Kittson then started trying out a shorter route from the Upper Red River to Lake Minnewaska, then along the Crow and Sauk Rivers to the Mississippi, and Sibley himself visited the area in 1847.{{Rp|94}}

=== Provisions for British troops ===
Both the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and Ramsay Crooks, who still controlled what remained of the American Fur Company, were angered by increasing competition from Sibley and Kittson. In August 1846, 350 British troops arrived in the Red River settlement, in response to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s call for help to put an end to further smuggling.{{Rp|94}}

Ironically, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company quickly found that they lacked enough provisions to supply the British forces and had to send buyers overland to the Mississippi to purchase supplies. As they ran into further problems in shipping their provisions up the Red River, Henry Sibley graciously offered his assistance. From this time onward, Sibley and Kittson proceeded to build a thriving business in supplying the British troops with everything from champagne to sheet iron stoves, transporting goods up the Red River Trail.{{Rp|94–96}}

=== Trade with the Dakota ===

Sibley&#x27;s trade with the western Dakota bands declined sharply in the 1840s. In 1844, a measles epidemic led to a decline in the number of Dakota hunters, and the dwindling population of elk, buffalo and other game forced the remaining hunters to push westward. In 1844 and 1845, bad weather and prairie fires temporarily drove the buffalo into the James River valley, but in the years that followed, the herds virtually disappeared. In 1846, drought and the failure of the corn crop made things worse, particularly among the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands, and traders including Martin McLeod and Norman Kittson had to extend credit to the Dakota in the form of food.{{Rp|96–97}}

The Mdewakantons, on the other hand, were somewhat cushioned by the annuities they received from the 1837 treaty. In addition, some Mdewakantons such as Taoyateduta Little Crow, who succeeded his father as chief of the Kaposia band in 1846, found ways to trade which effectively competed with Sibley&#x27;s business. By 1848, a ring of Dakota including Little Crow had become so successful in trading whiskey for fur skins that Sibley and McLeod were compelled to set up river patrols to stop any canoes carrying contraband to the west.

From 1842 to 1846, Sibley also bought buffalo hides from Joseph R. Brown on his personal account, even though Brown was a competitor of Choteau Company&#x27;s Upper Mississippi Outfit. When Brown finally exited the fur trade, Sibley bought out his interests and assets on generous terms.{{Rp|101}}

=== Formation of the Northern Outfit ===
In the summer of 1848, Henry Mower Rice, who had taken over trade with the Winnebago when Hercules Dousman exited the business, proposed the creation of a new Northern Outfit. The Northern Outfit combined the Dakota, Winnebago and Ojibwe trade under a single business unit. The Choteau Company held half of the firm, while Sibley, Rice and a new partner, Sylvanus Lowry, each held one-sixth. Sibley would later come to regret this move.{{Rp|99}}

==Early experience in public office==
Henry Sibley was initiated into public life as a young man in Michigan Territory when he received his first commission as justice of the peace of Mackinac County from Governor George Bryan Porter.{{Rp|76}}

=== Magistrate in Iowa Territory ===
After moving to Mendota, Sibley received a similar commission as a justice of the peace of Clayton County, which he called &quot;an empire of itself&quot; in size, extending from a line twenty miles below Prairie du Chien on the west of the Mississippi River to Pembina, and across to the Missouri River.{{Rp|265}} He had been appointed by Governor John Chambers of the newly organized Iowa Territory in 1838, and received extensions to his commission through 1842. Sibley later stated that it was his &quot;fortune to be the first to introduce the machinery of law...into what was a benighted region&quot; and that he had felt free of oversight:&quot;As I was the only magistrate in this region and the county seat was some three hundred miles distant, I had matters pretty much under my own control, there being little chance of an appeal from my decisions. In fact some of the simple-minded people around me, firmly believed that I had the power of life and death.&quot;{{Rp|266}}As justice of the peace, Sibley heard a wide range of cases. In 1838, he was called to investigate the death of John Hays, a former sergeant at Fort Snelling, which has been billed as the &quot;oldest murder mystery in Minnesota.&quot; The investigation resulted in the arrest of Edward Phalen, Hays&#x27;s business partner, a few weeks later. For jurisdictional reasons, however, Sibley passed on the case to Joseph R. Brown, who was appointed as justice of the peace for Crawford County in 1839, and Phalen was found not guilty of murder despite his self-incriminatory testimony.

In 1840, Sibley was called upon to hear a criminal case involving the brutal rape of a ten-year-old girl which took place in Wisconsin Territory, because justice of the peace Joseph Brown was away at the legislature in Madison.{{Rp|78}}

== Lobbying in Washington ==

=== Lobbyist for the Doty Treaty ===
Following the defeat of Jacksonian Democrat Martin Van Buren in the 1840 United States presidential election, the new Secretary of War John Bell moved quickly to try to purchase land from the Dakota. Bell had long been a proponent of a plan commissioned by John C. Calhoun and written by Reverend Jedidiah Morse which had called for the creation of an &quot;all-Indian territory&quot; that would eventually become a state. Bell&#x27;s stated intention was to remove all Indians from the northeastern United States to the Minnesota valley.{{Rp|80}}

Much to the surprise of Henry Sibley and the partners of the American Fur Company&#x27;s Western Outfit, John Bell appointed Governor James Duane Doty of Wisconsin Territory to negotiate a treaty with the Dakota to acquire 30 million acres of land on behalf of the U.S. and require their settlement in farming communities as part of a plan to grant citizenship.

On July 31, 1841, Governor Doty concluded a treaty with the Sisseton, Wahpeton and Wahpekute in Traverse des Sioux, with assistance from Alexis Bailly as secretary, although several major chiefs including Sleepy Eyes and Burning Earth did not participate.{{Rp|143}} Doty testified that Sibley and several of his subsidiary traders and employees had provided &quot;indispensable aid&quot; in securing agreement from the Dakota. Specifically, Sibley had promised the Dakota bands that he would supply the goods worth $10,000 which Doty had agreed to as gifts.{{Rp|81}}

On August 4, 1841, Doty concluded a similar treaty with Mdewakanton in Mendota, and then left, tasking Sibley and Hercules L. Dousman with securing signatures from chiefs Wacouta and Wabasha III, who had refused to attend the signing.

Dousman was pleased with the Doty Treaty, which included up to $150,000 to compensate traders for debts held by the Dakota, despite the fact that Bell had specifically forbidden such a clause. The treaty also called for paying off the &quot;mixed-bloods&quot; who had had land set aside for them by the Fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1830, many of whom owed sizable debts to the Western Outfit.

Furthermore, Doty had recommended twelve individuals for positions in the new territory, including Henry H. Sibley for the post of superintendent or governor, plus eight other traders associated with the Sioux Outfit. Sibley wrote to Ramsay Crooks on August 26, 1841:&quot;The provisions of this treaty, I consider to be better calculated for securing the interests of the Indians and of the people in the country than those of any treaty which has been made with the north-western Indians.&quot;However, any hope that the treaty would be ratified quickly disappeared as animosity grew between President John Tyler, who had succeeded President William Henry Harrison after he died only a month after inauguration, and Tyler&#x27;s inherited cabinet, as well as the national Whig Party. By the end of the summer, most of the cabinet including John Bell had resigned. As one of his final acts as Secretary of War, Bell sent the Doty treaty to the Senate and recommended it for urgent approval, but further consideration of the treaty was tabled until the spring. Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri voiced his vehement opposition to President Tyler, writing: &quot;The whole scheme of the treaty, &amp; the terms of it is in my own opinion the most unjustifiable &amp; reprehensible thing of the kind that has come before the Senate.&quot;{{Rp|82}} He opposed the policy of government-assisted &quot;civilization&quot; underpinning the treaty, as well as the fact that it was trying to circumvent longstanding laws governing the formation of new territories.

In January 1842, Ramsay Crooks sent Henry Sibley to Washington to serve as the chief manager of the lobbying effort for the Doty Treaty, reminding him that the future of the Western Outfit &quot;depend[ed] very much&quot; on its ratification.{{Rp|144}} The new Secretary of War, John Canfield Spencer, was a steadfast supporter of the treaty and came to rely heavily on Sibley for information about relations with Native American tribes in the region. The two senators from Michigan, William Woodbridge and Augustus Seymour Porter, favored the treaty, but the main obstacle to ratification was the opposition of Senator Thomas Benton, who also chaired the Committee on Indian Affairs. Sibley enlisted help from influencers including Pierre Chouteau Jr. and Joseph Nicollet, both of whom were highly respected by Senator Benton, to convince him to change his mind. Nevertheless, Benton remained staunchly opposed, and major modifications to the treaty failed to produce any breakthrough. Sibley left Washington in April, leaving all further lobbying to Robert Stuart, his former manager at American Fur Company in Mackinac, who had by then had become superintendent of Indian affairs for Michigan.{{Rp|83–84}}

On August 29, 1842, the Senate voted against ratification of the Doty treaty with the Dakota by a vote of 26 to 2. With the defeat of the treaty, Sibley&#x27;s prospects as governor of a new all-Indian territory in the northwest faded completely. Helen Sibley&#x27;s biographer, Bruce A. Kohn, adds, &quot;The lands of the Dakota would not become a homeland for indigenous peoples where Helen might have lived with her mother.&quot;{{Rp|39}}

=== Lobbyist against Winnebago relocation ===
In October 1846, a few Winnebago leaders signed a treaty with the U.S. in which they agreed to move their people north to an unspecified tract of land between the Dakota and Ojibwe. Both Hercules L. Dousman and Henry Mower Rice were active in engineering the agreement. The treaty was contingent on land being secured from either the Dakota or the Ojibwe tribes. Dousman probably expected Sibley to persuade the Dakota to cede land for this purpose, but Sibley was firmly opposed to relocating the Winnebago as a &quot;buffer&quot; between the Dakota and Ojibwe.{{Rp|98}}

In December 1846, Sibley went to Washington to lobby against the relocation of the Winnebago, hoping to persuade Michigan Senator Lewis Cass to oppose the treaty. Dousman suspected Sibley&#x27;s intentions, and the relationship between the two men cooled significantly.{{Rp|98–99}}

Despite Sibley&#x27;s efforts, Congress ratified the treaty in January 1847. The Dakota remained opposed to any sale of land, but Rice convinced the Ojibwe to give up a tract west of the Mississippi between the Watab and Crow Wing Rivers. In the fall of 1847, Sibley wrote to his friend Charles Christopher Trowbridge regarding the Winnebago:&quot;These poor fellows will be thrust between the powerful contending tribes of Sioux and Chippewas, and I fear they will fare badly... The whole policy pursued by the Govt. toward the Western Indians generally, has a tendency to destroy them, and that speedily. They dare now avow this as their object...but by persisting in a course which they have been repeatedly warned must end in the extinction of the tribes, they show how little real regard they have for their welfare.&quot;{{Rp|99}}In the summer of 1848, the Winnebago reluctantly began to move, with assistance from Colonel Seth Eastman and a company of infantry from Fort Snelling. Dousman and Rice received payment for &quot;tribal debts.&quot; Dousman, who had chosen not to renew his contract with Choteau and Company after the original contract expired in 1846, had exited the fur trade and focused on his other business ventures.

== Political career ==

=== Boundary with Wisconsin and governmental vacuum ===
In December 1847, Wisconsin&#x27;s second constitutional convention voted to place the northwestern border of Wisconsin at the Rum and Mississippi Rivers. In January 1848, St. Paul citizens petitioned Congress to oppose the proposed Rum River boundary.{{Rp|103}} Rather than being relegated to a minor role at the far western edge of the new state, they envisioned St. Paul at the center of a new territorial government. Henry Sibley vigorously supported their efforts to keep St. Paul and the St. Croix valley out of the borders of Wisconsin, bringing him into direct conflict with his old business partner Hercules L. Dousman. Dousman once again had his eye on further opportunities to obtain treaty money, and wrote to Sibley that a Wisconsin border on the Rum River line would create pressure for a major Dakota land cession to the west of the Mississippi River. Wisconsin became a state on May 29, 1848, with Wisconsin&#x27;s northwestern border finally pushed back to the St. Croix River.{{Rp|176}} The residents of St. Paul, the lumbermen along the St. Croix, and the sawmill workers of St. Anthony Falls suddenly found themselves in a peculiar legal and governmental vacuum. Although most of them had protested against inclusion in the new state of Wisconsin, they were shocked and disappointed to find themselves left behind in &quot;a no-man&#x27;s land without law or government...its people without corporate existence.&quot;{{Rp|236}}

==== Appointment as delegate by Stillwater convention ====
On August 26, 1848, Sibley attended a &quot;convention&quot; held in Stillwater which had been called by several concerned citizens of the St. Croix valley, as well as Joseph R. Brown, Franklin Steele and himself. During the convention, Joseph Brown was appointed chair of a committee which drafted &quot;memorials&quot; to Congress and to the president, requesting the formation of a territory of Minnesota as soon as possible.The main resolution of the convention was to then appoint &quot;a delegate to visit Washington to represent the interests of the proposed territory, with full power to act.&quot; Sibley let it be known that he was willing to go to Washington to present the memorials and lobby for the new territory on his own expense.{{Rp|103}} He received the majority of votes and was declared unanimously elected by the convention. Upon a motion introduced by Morton S. Wilkinson, Henry H. Sibley was issued with a certificate signed by the officers of the convention that he had been duly elected as their representative in Washington. The memorials were then signed by the 61 delegates of the convention and adjourned.

==== Election for Congressional delegate from &quot;Wisconsin Territory&quot; ====
In parallel with these developments, John Catlin, who had been secretary of the former Wisconsin Territory, started to promote the idea that the territory of Wisconsin continued to exist in the area that had been excluded from the state of Wisconsin, since the original act creating the territory had not been repealed by Congress. By that logic, Catlin himself was now acting governor by law. Once John Hubbard Tweedy, who had been the delegate to Congress from Wisconsin Territory, formally resigned his position, the acting governor could then lawfully call an election to fill the vacancy.{{Rp|238–239}}

On September 18, John H. Tweedy resigned, and on October 9, 1848, acting Governor Catlin issued a proclamation for an election to be held on October 30.

At first, the general expectation was that Henry H. Sibley would be the obvious choice for the role. His election campaign took an unexpected turn when his new business partner in the Northern Outfit, Henry Mower Rice, declared his candidacy for the role. Technically, neither Sibley nor Rice were residents of &quot;Wisconsin Territory,&quot; but this was not required by law and the question was never raised. After a brief campaign, Sibley won the election with 236 votes to Rice&#x27;s 122 votes. Sibley had stronger support in St. Paul and the St. Croix valley, while Rice found his strongest support from his own employees and business associates at Crow Wing, as well as the majority of mill workers at St. Anthony Falls, where Rice was said to have bought votes outright on election day.{{Rp|105–106}}

==== Speech before House Committee and recognition by Congress ====
In early November 1848, Sibley made the long journey to Washington with his wife Sarah and their two children. On December 22, 1848, Henry H, Sibley delivered his famous speech before the House Committee on Elections. Henry Sibley&#x27;s biographer, Rhoda R. Gilman, writes: That winter in Washington was not only the beginning, but also in one sense the high point of Sibley&#x27;s political career. Certainly it was the most satisfying part, for he became at once an agent of history and a symbol of the new territory. The tale of how he rose, polished and urbane, before a Congress that had expected a figure in buckskin and eloquently defended the right of pioneers to the protection of government and law became — almost immediately — Minnesota&#x27;s most cherished founding legend.{{Rp|106–107}}

=== Congressional delegate for Minnesota Territory ===
The Wisconsin Territory&#x27;s at-large congressional district was eliminated with the creation of the Territory of Minnesota on March 3, 1849. He was subsequently elected as the first representative of the Minnesota Territory&#x27;s at-large congressional district, serving in the 31st and 32nd congresses from July 7, 1849 – March 3, 1853.

=== Legislator in Minnesota Territorial House of Representatives ===
Sibley was elected to the Minnesota Territorial House of Representatives, convened from January to March 1855, as the representative of Dakota County.

=== President of Minnesota Constitutional Convention ===
He was a member of the Democratic Party wing of the first Minnesota Constitutional Convention, of which he eventually became president. Assembled July 13, 1857, the convention resulted in adoption of the constitution as framed on October 13, 1857.

=== First governor of state of Minnesota ===
In 1858 Sibley was elected as the first governor of the state, and is one of just four Minnesota Democrats to win a gubernatorial election with a Democrat in the White House. He served from May 24, 1858, until January 2, 1860. After narrowly defeating Republican Alexander Ramsey in the first state gubernatorial contest, Sibley declared in his inaugural address, &quot;I have no object and no interests which are not inseparably bound up with the welfare of the state.&quot; He did not seek reelection.

====Railroad bond issue====
When the legislature voted for the state to issue bonds to the railroads to provide for construction of the transcontinental route, Sibley refused. He said the railroads did not give priority of lien to the state on their property. The state supreme court ordered the governor to issue the legislatively authorized state bonds to railroads. The legislature asked him to market the bonds in New York. Although he made an effort to do, the capitalists refused to buy the bonds. The state subsequently repudiated the issuance.

==Role in Dakota War of 1862==
{{Main|Dakota War of 1862}}
In the wake of treaties negotiated with them by Sibley, Native American tribes that had until recently roamed freely across the territory were severely diminished in land and resource rights. By 1858, the Dakota, Ojibwe and Winnebago were relegated to reservations. The changes were particularly harsh for the Dakota, who were forced to live on a reservation located on narrow slice of land by the Minnesota River.
By 1862, the pressure had become too much. The Sioux now claim they were coerced and manipulated to relinquish their own culture and religion and routinely misled and cheated by Sibley and others. Faced with starvation and missed annuity payments due them from the federal
government, largely due to the ongoing Civil War, many Dakota people saw an opportunity to retake the lands of Minnesota and began attacking the settlers in an effort to drive them out.

===Commanding Officer===
On August 19, 1862, Governor Alexander Ramsey appointed former Governor Sibley as colonel of volunteers. He was directed to the upper Minnesota River to lead an expedition of relief to Fort Ridgely, which had been under attack from Dakota warriors led by Little Crow. On August 29, Sibley&#x27;s forces rescued the 250 settlers left after the Dakota abandoned the fort four days earlier, after their failed attempt to capture it.

After that, he was involved in the engagement of Birch Coulee and Wood Lake. The last engagement was a decisive battle. It resulted in the Dakota releasing 269 captives – 107 European-American and 162 biracial.

=== Military commission and trials ===
Between September 28 and November 5, 1862, a military commission created by Sibley as commanding officer conducted 392 trials for murder, participation in murder, participation in combat, and rape. It was a court with no lawyers for the defendants. Some of the trials lasted only a few minutes. By November 5, the commission had sentenced 307 men to death and given 16 prison terms. Sibley approved all death sentences except for one and passed the results on to General John Pope; by November 7, they{{who|date=August 2024}} had cut the total number of death sentences to 303. On December 6, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln approved 39 of the 303 death sentences after having two advisors review them. Thirty-eight men were hanged at Mankato, December 26, 1862, including at least one whose sentence had been commuted by President Lincoln.

The remaining 300 Dakota warriors were imprisoned and more than 1,600 non-combatants: women, children and elderly were held in a crowded encampment on Pike Island below Fort Snelling until river transportation resumed in the spring . A palisade was erected to protect the interned from the soldiers and settlers after one of the women was assaulted. Many died as a result of a measles epidemic
that swept the camp in December.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

For his efforts, Sibley was promoted to brigadier-general of volunteers, September 29, 1862, after the hostilities had ended. Sibley turned over his command to Colonel Stephen A. Miller of the 7th Minnesota Infantry Regiment. On November 25, he became commander of the newly created Military District of Minnesota, with headquarters in St. Paul.\

=== Expedition of 1863 ===
Meanwhile, treaties with the Dakota were nullified and Sibley proceeded with leading the banishment of all tribal members from the state to reservations in the Dakotas and Nebraska. The state offered a reward for the scalp of any Dakota man killed in Minnesota.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

For the next two years Sibley and General Alfred Sully led a large and vicious campaigns to pursue Dakota escapees as far west as the Yellowstone River. In 1863, Sibley led what was then-considered a successful expedition against the Sioux in Dakota Territory. This campaign included the battles of Big Mound (July 24), Dead Buffalo Lake (July 26), and Stony Lake (July 28). This period would become the start of bloody wars between the U.S. government and Dakota that lasted until nearly twenty years.

On November 29, 1865, he was brevetted as major-general of the volunteers for &quot;efficient and meritorious services.&quot; He was honorably mustered out on April 30, 1866. He was relieved from the command of the Military District of Minnesota with the disbandment of the district in August 1866.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

== Involvement in Indian affairs ==
After his military service, Sibley was active in settling several Indian treaties.

==Ongoing business interests==
Sibley served as the president of several railroads, banks, and other large corporations.

=== Railroad bond issue ===
Sibley dedicated considerable energy to trying to resolve the railroad bond issue.

== Civic responsibilities ==

=== Minnesota Historical Society and Old Settler&#x27;s Association ===
He also served a variety of civic organizations. He became a member of the Minnesota Historical Society in 1849 and eventually served as president. He joined the Old Settlers&#x27; association of that state in 1858.

=== St. Paul Chamber of Commerce ===
In December 1866, Henry Sibley took the lead in reestablishing the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce. He served numerous terms as its president, and focused its efforts on public and charitable projects.{{Rp|224}} In July 1872, Sibley shared his concerns for the welfare of Old Bets, who was living on his property in Mendota but was too ill to provide for herself. Betsey, an elderly Mdewakanton woman, had been a well known figure in St. Paul, and was widely respected for her kindness toward the white captives during the Dakota War of 1862. Sibley passed a hat and raised $63.60 from the board members which was contributed to Saint Peter&#x27;s Church, specifically for her care.

In 1873, a massive grasshopper infestation ruined crops across southwestern Minnesota, and spread even further the following summer. In December 1873, Sibley worked with the St. Paul Chamber of Commerce to raise $6,000 to aid families in Cottonwood County. They formed an executive committee to approach members of the business community for contributions; Sibley himself contacted the directors and out-of-state shareholders of the railroads which ran through the affected area. In 1874, Governor Cushman Kellogg Davis asked Sibley to administer the distribution of $19,000 in funds raised for the relief of settlers worst affected by the grasshopper invasion, working with John S. Pillsbury of Minneapolis.{{Rp|216–217}}

=== Board appointments ===
In 1867 he was appointed to the board of visitors to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He was also president of the board of regents of the University of Minnesota, and president of the Board of Indian Commissioners from 1875 to 1876. He was awarded an honorary LL.D. from the College of New Jersey (later known as Princeton University), in 1888.

}}Henry Hastings Sibley died in St. Paul, Minnesota on February 18, 1891, two days before his 80th birthday, and is buried in Oakland Cemetery in St. Paul. Historian Wilson P. Shortridge wrote, &quot;When Sibley, in 1834, made his way into the region which became Minnesota, it was a typical fur-traders&#x27; frontier; when he died, Minnesota was a state with a population of almost one and one-half millions.&quot;

==Written works==
Henry Hastings Sibley contributed to the collections of the Minnesota Historical Society, to &quot;Spirit of the Times,&quot; and to &quot;The Turf, Field and Farm.&quot; Among his work for the Minnesota Historical Society were memoirs of Joseph Nicolas Nicollet, Hercules L. Dousman and Jean Baptiste Faribault.

<text>Henry Adoniram Swift (March 23, 1823February 25, 1869) was an American politician who was the third Governor of Minnesota. He served as governor from July 10, 1863 to January 11, 1864 after serving as the third Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota when Governor Alexander Ramsey resigned to enter the United States Congress. Prior to that he had served in the Minnesota Senate. Swift was a Republican.

Described by peers as gentle, self-effacing, and ambivalent toward politics, Henry Swift was Minnesota&#x27;s third governor for less than a year, completing the second term of Alexander Ramsey, who had been elected United States Senator. With little time or apparent inclination to effect major change, this un-elected governor concentrated on assuring the welfare of Civil War veterans.

After graduation with honors from Western Reserve College in his native Ohio, Swift tutored the children of a slave owner in Mississippi, an experience that reinforced his commitment to abolition. He returned to Ohio, earned a law degree, and began a career in business and government service.

He and his family journeyed to Minnesota in 1853, settling first in St. Paul then St. Peter. With his partners in the St. Peter Land Company, he campaigned, unsuccessfully, to relocate the state capital in their burgeoning Minnesota River town.

Swift left his commercial enterprises in 1861 for the state senate seat that propelled him into the governorship. Later he served two more terms in the senate and was a reluctant candidate for the U.S. Senate. &quot;I shall be ten times happier with my family in St. Peter than as Senator at Washington,&quot; he declared characteristically upon learning he had lost the Republican senatorial nomination in 1865. Four years later, he succumbed to typhoid fever at age 45.

Swift County, Minnesota was named after him in 1870.

<text>A portable computer is a computer designed to be easily moved from one place to another, as opposed to those designed to remain stationary at a single location such as desktops and workstations. These computers usually include a display and keyboard that are directly connected to the main case, all sharing a single power plug together, much like later desktop computers called &quot;all-in-ones&quot; (AIO) that integrate the system&#x27;s internal components into the same case as the display. In modern usage, a portable computer usually refers to a very light and compact personal computer such as a laptop, subnotebook or handheld PC, while touchscreen-based handheld (&quot;palmtop&quot;) devices such as tablets, phablets and smartphones are called mobile devices instead.

The first commercially sold portable computer might be the MCM/70, released 1974. The next major portables were the IBM 5100 (1975), Osborne&#x27;s CP/M-based Osborne 1 (1981) and Compaq&#x27;s , advertised as 100% IBM PC compatible Compaq Portable (1983). These luggable computers still required a continuous connection to an external power source; this limitation was later overcome by the laptop computers. Laptops were followed by lighter models such as netbooks, so that in the 2000s mobile devices and by 2007 smartphones made the term &quot;portable&quot; rather meaningless. The 2010s introduced wearable computers such as smartwatches.

Portable computers, by their nature, are generally microcomputers. Larger portable computers were commonly known as &#x27;Lunchbox&#x27; or &#x27;Luggable&#x27; computers. They are also called &#x27;Portable Workstations&#x27; or &#x27;Portable PCs&#x27;. In Japan they were often called from &quot;bento&quot;.

Portable computers, more narrowly defined, are distinct from desktop replacement computers in that they usually were constructed from full-specification desktop components, and often do not incorporate features associated with laptops or mobile devices. A portable computer in this usage, versus a laptop or other mobile computing device, have a standard motherboard or backplane providing plug-in slots for add-in cards. This allows mission specific cards such as test, A/D, or communication protocol (IEEE-488, 1553) to be installed. Portable computers also provide for more disk storage by using standard disk drives and provide for multiple drives.

==Early history==
===SCAMP===
In 1973, the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center developed a portable computer prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) based on the IBM PALM processor with a Philips compact cassette drive, small CRT and full function keyboard. SCAMP emulated an IBM 1130 minicomputer in order to run APL\1130. In 1973, APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9800 offered only BASIC. Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL\1130 performance on a portable, single user computer, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 1983 designated SCAMP a &quot;revolutionary concept&quot; and &quot;the world&#x27;s first personal computer&quot;. The engineering prototype is in the Smithsonian Institution.

===Xerox NoteTaker===
Xerox NoteTaker, developed in 1976 at Xerox PARC, was a precursor to later portable computers from Osborne Computer Corporation and Compaq, though it remained a prototype and did not enter production.

===IBM 5100===

Successful demonstrations of the 1973 SCAMP prototype led to the first commercial IBM 5100 portable microcomputer launched in 1975. The product incorporated an IBM PALM processor, CRT, full function keyboard and the ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers, analysts, statisticians and other business problem-solvers. (IBM provided different models of the 5100 supporting only BASIC, only APL, or both selectable by a physical switch on the front panel.) IBM referred to its PALM processor as a microprocessor, though they used that term to mean a processor that executes microcode to implement a higher-level instruction set, rather than its conventional definition of a complete processor on a single silicon integrated circuit; the PALM processor was a large circuit board populated with over a dozen chips. In the late 1960s, such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton (). In comparison, the IBM 5100 weighed about 53 pounds (24 kg and very portable for that time).

===MIT Suitcase Computer===
The MIT Suitcase Computer, constructed in 1975, was the first known microprocessor-based portable computer. It was based on the Motorola 6800. Constructed in a Samsonite suitcase approximately and weighing approximately , it had 4K of SRAM, a serial port to accept downloaded software and connect to a modem, a keyboard and a 40-column thermal printer taken from a cash register. Built by student David Emberson in the MIT Digital Systems Laboratory as a thesis project, it never entered production. It is currently in the collection of Dr. Hoo-Min D. Toong.

===Micro Star or Small One===
An early portable computer was manufactured in 1979 by GM Research, a small company in Santa Monica, California. The machine which was designed and patented by James Murez. It was called the Micro Star and later the name was changed to The Small One. Although Xerox claims to have designed the first such system, the machine by Murez predated anything on the market or that had been documented in any publication at the time hence the patent was issued. As early as 1979, the U.S. Government was contracting to purchase these machines. Other major customers included Sandia Labs, General Dynamics, BBN (featured on the cover of their annual report in 1980 as the C.A.T. system) and several dozen private individuals and companies around the world. In 1979, Adam Osborne viewed the machine along with several hundred other visitors at the first computer show that was sponsored by the IEEE Westec in Los Angeles. Later that year the machine was also shown at the first COMDEX show.

===Portal R2E CCMC===
The portable micro computer; the &quot;Portal&quot; of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially appeared in September 1980 at the Sicob show in Paris. The Portal was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and developments department of the French firm R2E Micral in 1980 at the request of the company CCMC specializing in payroll and accounting. The Portal was based on an intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHz. It was equipped with a central 64 KB RAM, a keyboard with 58 alpha numeric keys and 11 numeric keys (separate blocks), a 32-character screen, a floppy disk: capacity = 140 000 characters, of a thermal printer: speed = 28 characters / sec, an asynchronous channel, a synchronous channel, a 220 V power supply. Designed for an operating temperature of , it weighed and its dimensions were . It provided total mobility. Its operating system was Prolog. A few hundred were sold between 1980 and 1983.

===Osborne 1===

The first mass-produced microprocessor-based portable computer released in 1981 was the Osborne 1, developed by Osborne, which owed much to the NoteTaker&#x27;s design. The company had early success with the design and went public but later due to small screen sizes and other devices being released found trouble selling the Osborne. The Osborne 1 is about the size and weight of a sewing machine, and was advertised as the only computer that would fit underneath an airline seat.

===Kaypro===
Another early portable computer released in 1982 was named the Kaypro II, although it was the company&#x27;s first commercially available product. Some of the press mocked its design—one magazine described Kaypro Corporation as &quot;producing computers packaged in tin cans&quot;. Others raved about its value, as the company advertised the Kaypro II as &quot;the computer that sells for &quot;, some noting that the included software bundle had a retail value over by itself, and by mid-1983 the company was selling more than 10,000 units a month, briefly making it the fifth-largest computer maker in the world. It managed to correct most of the Osborne 1&#x27;s deficiencies: the screen was larger and showed more characters at once, the floppy drives stored over twice as much data, the case was more attractive-looking, and it was also much better-built and more reliable.

===Grid Compass===
The Grid Compass ran its own operating system, GRiD-OS. Its specialized software and high price (US$8,000–10,000) meant that it was limited to specialized applications. The main buyer was the U.S. government. NASA used it on the Space Shuttle during the early 1980s, as it was powerful, lightweight, and compact. The military Special Forces also purchased the machine, as it could be used by paratroopers in combat.

==Post-IBM PC portables==
===Compaq Portable and competitors===
Although Columbia Data Products&#x27; MPC 1600, &quot;Multi Personal Computer&quot; came out in the summer of 1982, one of the first extensively IBM PC compatible computers was the Compaq Portable. Eagle Computer then came out with their offering. and Corona Data Systems&#x27;s PPC-400., the &quot;portable&quot; Hyperion Computer System. Both Eagle Computer and Columbia were sued by IBM for copyright infringement of its BIOS. They settled and were forced to halt production. Neither the Columbia nor the Eagle were nearly as IBM PC DOS compatible as Compaq&#x27;s offerings.

===Commodore SX-64===
The first full-color portable computer was the Commodore SX-64 in January 1984..

=== Atari STacy ===
Originally announced in 1987, the Atari STacy was released to the public in December 1989 and was one of the first laptop-like portables.

===Apple Macintosh Portable===
Apple Inc. introduced and released the Macintosh Portable in 1989, though this device came with a battery, which added to its substantial weight. The Portable has features similar to the Atari STacy, include integrated trackball and clamshell case.

=== IBM PS/2 Portable ===
After release of IBM PC Convertible in 1986, IBM still produced classic portable computers, include released in 1989 PS/2 P70 (with upgrade in 1990 to P75), and IBM produce portables for up to release of PS/2 Note and PS/55note notebook lines.

==Modern portables==
In today&#x27;s world of laptops, smart phones, and tablets, portable computers have evolved and are now mostly used for industrial, commercial or military applications.

<text>Cushman Kellogg Davis (June 16, 1838November 27, 1900) was an American Republican politician who served as the seventh Governor of Minnesota and as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota.

==Early life and American Civil War==
Davis was born in Henderson, New York to Horatio N. Davis and Clarissa Cushman. His family moved to Wisconsin Territory before he was a year old (his father went on to serve as a member of the Wisconsin State Senate several different times). Cushman went to school at Carroll College and then the University of Michigan, graduating in 1857. Admitted to the bar in 1860, he soon after found himself serving in the American Civil War in the 28th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, serving first as a lieutenant in charge of Company B of this volunteer regiment. He was in action in the western campaigns, then in 1864 as an aide to General Willis A. Gorman.

==Political career==
Davis returned home in 1864 due to poor health. He relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota due to its reputation as a health resort and began to pursue a legal and political career. He was elected to the Minnesota State House of Representatives from 1867 to 1868 and was appointed as the United States District Attorney from 1868 to 1873. He resigned his position to run as the Republican candidate for Minnesota governor and won. During his term, he established a state board of railway commissioners, revised the state constitution to allow women to vote on school matters and hold elected office, and also provided assistance to farmers affected by a locust plague. He served one term from 1874 to 1876 and declined to be re-nominated for a second.

==Return to legal career and second political career==
Returning to his legal career, Davis successfully defended Judge Sherman Page in his 1878 impeachment trial. He also formed a partnership with Frank B. Kellogg and Cordenio Severance. In 1887, he was elected to the United States Senate. He would serve in the 50th, 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, 55th, and 56th United States Congresses, from 1887 to 1900. He was involved with legislation related to pensions and the construction of the Soo Locks. Beginning in 1897 he was the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was closely involved with the sequence of events leading to the Spanish–American War. He was also present at the talks for the Treaty of Paris which ended the war.

==Personal life==
Davis married Laura Bowman in 1862. He remarried Anna Malcom Agnew Fox at some point in the 1880s.

==Honors==
Davis was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1894. He was elected a vice-president general of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1895.

==Death==
Davis died while still in office in St. Paul on November 27, 1900. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

<doc id="250856" wikidata="Q430585" url="?curid=250856" title="Divine command theory">
<text>Divine command theory (also known as theological voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action&#x27;s status as morally good is equivalent to whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by God&#x27;s commands and that for a person to be moral he is to follow God&#x27;s commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God&#x27;s commands in establishing morality.

Numerous variants of the theory have been presented: historically, figures including Saint Augustine, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham and Søren Kierkegaard have presented various versions of divine command theory; more recently, Robert Merrihew Adams has proposed a &quot;modified divine command theory&quot; based on the omnibenevolence of God in which morality is linked to human conceptions of right and wrong. Paul Copan has argued in favour of the theory from a Christian viewpoint, and Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski&#x27;s divine motivation theory proposes that God&#x27;s motivations, rather than commands, are the source of morality.

Semantic challenges to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued that to be commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God&#x27;s command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to result in the moral arbitrariness of morality itself, or to result in the irrelevance of God to morality. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have defended the theory from these challenges.

==General form==
Although &quot;divine command&quot; is the standard term in the literature, God addresses people in all sorts of ways. The scholastics distinguished between five different forms of God&#x27;s revealed will, and they can be summarized in a Latin dactylic hexameter, &quot;Praecipit et prohibet, permittit, consultit, implet&quot;. &quot;Praecipit&quot; means &quot;gives precepts to&quot;. Precepts tell people to do something. They can include warning, admonishment or exhortation. &quot;Prohibet&quot; means &quot;prohibits&quot;. A prohibition is a command not to do something. &quot;Permittit&quot; means &quot;permits&quot;. A permission is not a command because a person is permitted both to do the thing and not to do it. &quot;Consultit&quot; means &quot;counsels&quot;. They can include advice, instruction or invitation. They are different from commands as the latter generally generate obligation, and there is normally some expectation of condemnation if the command is not carried out. Finally, &quot;implet&quot; means &quot;fulfils&quot;, which are directly effective commands. They do not need language-using human recipients. An example is &quot;Let there be light&quot;, and there is light. Sometimes &quot;command&quot; is taken to mean the whole family of speech acts, but sometimes it only includes those prescriptions which generate obligation.

Philosophers including William of Ockham (), St Augustine (354–430), Duns Scotus (), and John Calvin (1509–1564) have presented various forms of divine command theory. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that divine commands determine morality. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God&#x27;s command is the only reason that a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result of divine command, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God&#x27;s commands; what is morally right is what God desires.

Divine command theory features in the ethics of many contemporary religions – including Judaism, Islam, the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, and Christianity – as well as featuring in numerous polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, citizens commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, people commonly associate the two. DCT can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe parallels the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.

===Augustine===
Saint Augustine offered a version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as the pursuit of the supreme good, which delivers human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine&#x27;s ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato&#x27;s view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God&#x27;s commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.

===John Duns Scotus===
Scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus argued that the only moral obligations that God could not take away from humans involve loving God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing. Scotus argued that the natural law, in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God&#x27;s will, and thus form the first three commandments of the Ten Commandments. The last seven of the Ten Commandments do not belong to the natural law in the strictest sense. Whilst humanity&#x27;s duties to God are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, mankind&#x27;s duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as humanity is absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments:

Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that &quot;those of weak character&quot; would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without. Hence, the last seven commandments do belong to the natural law, but not in the strictest sense, as they belong to the natural law by rectitude rather than by definition.

===Thomas Aquinas===

Whilst Thomas Aquinas, as a natural law theorist, is generally seen as holding that morality is not willed by God, Kelly James Clark and Anne Poortenga have presented a defence of divine command theory based on Aquinas&#x27; moral theory. Aquinas proposed a theory of natural law which asserted that something is moral if it works towards the purpose of human existence, and so human nature can determine what is moral. Clark and Poortenga argued that God created human nature and thus commanded a certain morality; hence he cannot arbitrarily change what is right or wrong for humans.

===Immanuel Kant===
The deontological ethics of Immanuel Kant has been cast as rejecting divine command theory by several figures, among whom is ethicist R. M. Hare. Kant&#x27;s view that morality should be determined by the categorical imperative – duty to the moral law, rather than acting for a specific end – has been viewed as incompatible with divine command theory. Philosopher and theologian John E. Hare has noted that some philosophers see divine command theory as an example of Kant&#x27;s heteronomous will – motives besides the moral law, which Kant regarded as non-moral. American philosopher Lewis White Beck takes Kant&#x27;s argument to be a refutation of the theory that morality depends on divine authority. John E. Hare challenges this view, arguing that Kantian ethics should be seen as compatible with divine command theory.

===Robert Adams===
American philosopher Robert Merrihew Adams proposes what he calls a &quot;modified divine command theory&quot;. Adams presents the basic form of his theory by asserting that two statements are equivalent:

#It is wrong to do X.
#It is contrary to God&#x27;s commands to do X.

He proposes that God&#x27;s commands precede moral truths and must be explained in terms of moral truths, not the other way around. Adams writes that his theory is an attempt to define what being ethically &#x27;wrong&#x27; consists of and accepts that it is only useful to those within a Judeo-Christian context. In dealing with the criticism that a seemingly immoral act would be obligatory if God commanded it, he proposes that God does not command cruelty for its own sake. Adams does not propose that it would be logically impossible for God to command cruelty, rather that it would be unthinkable for him to do so because of his nature. Adams emphasises the importance of faith in God, specifically faith in God&#x27;s goodness, as well as his existence.

Adams proposes that an action is morally wrong if and only if it defies the commands of a loving God. If cruelty was commanded, he would not be loving; Adams argued that, in this instance, God&#x27;s commands would not have to be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God&#x27;s commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case. Adams&#x27; theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his omnibenevolence. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.

Adams proposes that in many Judeo-Christian contexts, the term &#x27;wrong&#x27; is used to mean being contrary to God&#x27;s commands. In ethical contexts, he believes that &#x27;wrong&#x27; entails an emotional attitude against an action and that these two uses of wrongness usually correlate. Adams suggests that a believer&#x27;s concept of morality is founded in their religious belief and that right and wrong are tied to their belief in God; this works because God always commands what believers accept to be right. If God commanded what a believer perceived as wrong, the believer would not say it is right or wrong to disobey him; rather their concept of morality would break down.

Michael Austin writes that an implication of this modified divine command theory is that God cannot command cruelty for its own sake; this could be argued to be inconsistent with God&#x27;s omnipotence. Aquinas argued that God&#x27;s omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do all things that are possible: he attempted to refute the idea that God&#x27;s inability to perform illogical actions challenges his omnipotence. Austin contends that commanding cruelty for its own sake is not illogical, so is not covered by Aquinas&#x27; defence, although Aquinas had argued that sin is the falling short of a perfect action and thus not compatible with omnipotence.

Paul Copan argues from a Christian viewpoint that man, made in God&#x27;s image, conforms to God&#x27;s sense of morality. The description of actions as right or wrong are therefore relevant to God; a person&#x27;s sense of what is right or wrong corresponds to God&#x27;s.
As an alternative to divine command theory, Linda Zagzebski has proposed divine motivation theory, which still fits into a monotheistic framework. According to this theory, goodness is determined by God&#x27;s motives, rather than by what he commands. Divine motivation theory is similar to virtue ethics because it considers the character of an agent, and whether they are in accordance with God&#x27;s, as the standard for moral value. Zagzebski argues that things in the world have objective moral properties, such as being lovable, which are given to them through God&#x27;s perception of them. God&#x27;s attitude towards something is cast as a morally good attitude. The theory casts God as a good example for morality, and humans should imitate his virtues as much as is possible for finite, imperfect beings.

==Objections==

===Semantic objections===
Philosopher William Wainwright considered a challenge to the theory on semantic grounds, arguing that &quot;being commanded by God&quot; and &quot;being obligatory&quot; do not mean the same thing, contrary to what the theory suggests. He used the example of water not having an identical meaning to to propose that &quot;being commanded by God&quot; does not have an identical meaning to &quot;being obligatory&quot;. This was not an objection to the truth of divine command theory, but Wainwright believed it demonstrated that the theory should not be used to formulate assertions about the meaning of obligation. Wainwright also noted that divine command theory might imply that one can only have moral knowledge if one has knowledge of God; Edward Wierenga argued that, if this is the case, the theory seems to deny atheists and agnostics moral knowledge. Hugh Storer Chandler has challenged the theory based on modal ideas of what might exist in different worlds. He suggested that, even if one accepts that being commanded by God and being morally right are the same, they may not be synonyms because they might be different in other possible worlds.

===Moral motivation===
Michael Austin has noted that divine command theory could be criticised for prompting people to be moral with impure motivations. He writes of the objection that a moral life should be sought because morality is valued, rather than to avoid punishment or receive a reward. This punishment and reward system of motivation could be seen as inadequate.

===Euthyphro dilemma===

The Euthyphro dilemma was proposed in Plato&#x27;s dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro. In the scene, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety when Socrates presents the dilemma, which can be presented as the question &quot;Is X good because God commands it, or does God command X because it is good?&quot;.

The Euthyphro dilemma can elicit the response that an action is good because God commands the action, or that God commands an action because it is good. If the first is chosen, it would imply that whatever God commands must be good: even if he commanded someone to inflict suffering, then inflicting suffering must be moral. If the latter is chosen, then morality is no longer dependent on God, defeating the divine command theory. Additionally, if God is subject to an external law, he is not sovereign or omnipotent, which would challenge the orthodox conception of God. Proponents of the Euthyphro dilemma might claim that divine command theory is obviously wrong because either answer challenges the ability of God to give moral laws.

William of Ockham responded to the Euthyphro Dilemma by &#x27;biting the bullet&#x27;. He argued that, if God did command people to be cruel, then that would be morally obligatory, proposing that the only limitation to what God can make obligatory is the principle of non-contradiction. Robert Adams defended Ockham&#x27;s view, noting that it is only a logical possibility that God would command what mankind considers to be immoral, not an actuality. Even if God could logically command these actions, he would not because that is not his character. Eleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann have responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by appealing to the doctrine of divine simplicity, a concept associated with Aquinas and Aristotle which suggests that the substance and attributes of God are identical. They propose that God and goodness are identical and that this is what makes his commands good.

American philosopher William Alston responded to the Euthyphro dilemma by considering what it means for God to be morally good. If divine command theory is accepted, it implies that God is good because he obeys his own commands; Alston argued that this is not the case and that God&#x27;s goodness is distinct from abiding by moral obligations. He suggested that a moral obligation implies that there is some possibility that the agent may not honour their obligation; Alston argued that this possibility does not exist for God, so his morality must be distinct from simply obeying his own commands. Alston contended that God is the supreme standard of morality and acts according to his character, which is necessarily good. There is no more arbitrariness in this view than accepting another moral standard.

===Omnibenevolence===
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and some more recent philosophers, challenged the theory of divine command because it seems to entail that God&#x27;s goodness consists of his following his own commands. It is argued that, if divine command theory is accepted, God&#x27;s obligations would be what he commanded himself to do; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent. Neither could God hold any virtues, as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands – if he cannot logically command himself, then he cannot logically have any virtues. Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good, but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy. William Wainwright argues that, although God does not act because of his commands, it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions. He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and, when he commands what is morally good, it becomes morally obligatory.

===Autonomy===
Michael Austin draws attention to an objection from autonomy, which argues that morality requires an agent to freely choose which principles they live by. This challenges the view of divine command theory that God&#x27;s will determines what is good because humans are no longer autonomous, but followers of an imposed moral law, making autonomy incompatible with divine command theory. Robert Adams challenges this criticism, arguing that humans must still choose to accept or reject God&#x27;s commands and rely on their independent judgement about whether or not to follow them.

===Pluralism===
Austin considers the view that, in a world of religious pluralism, it is impossible to know which god&#x27;s or religion&#x27;s commands should be followed, especially because some religions contradict others, leaving it impossible to accept all of them. Within religions there are also various interpretations of what is commanded. Austin notes that some of the responses to the autonomy objection may be relevant, as an agent must choose whichever religion and morality they judge to be correct. He argues that divine command theory is also consistent with the view that moral truths can be found in all religions and that moral revelation can be found apart from religion. Heimir Geirsson and Margaret Holmgren argue against the view that different religions can lead to the same God because some religions are incompatible with each other (monotheistic and polytheistic religions have contrasting views of divinity, for example, and some Greek or Norse gods magnified human weaknesses). They argue that determining which god should be listened to remains a problem and that, even within a religion, contrasting views of God exist – the commands of God in the Old and New Testaments could seem to contradict each other.

<doc id="250858" wikidata="Q407592" url="?curid=250858" title="Tramadol">
<text>Tramadol, sold under the brand name Ultram among others, is an opioid pain medication and a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) used to treat moderately severe pain. When taken by mouth in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually begins within an hour. It is also available by injection. It is available in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen).
As is typical of opioids, common side effects include constipation, itchiness, and nausea. Serious side effects may include hallucinations, seizures, increased risk of serotonin syndrome, decreased alertness, and drug addiction. A change in dosage may be recommended in those with kidney or liver problems. It is not recommended in those who are at risk of suicide or in those who are pregnant. While not recommended in women who are breastfeeding, those who take a single dose should not generally have to stop breastfeeding. Tramadol is converted in the liver to &quot;O&quot;-desmethyltramadol (desmetramadol), an opioid with a stronger affinity for the μ-opioid receptor.

Tramadol was patented in 1972 and launched under the name &quot;Tramal&quot; in 1977 by the West German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH. In the mid-1990s, it was approved in the United Kingdom and the United States. It is available as a generic medication and marketed under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 55th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==

Tramadol is used primarily to treat mild to severe pain, both acute and chronic. There is moderate evidence for use as a second-line treatment for fibromyalgia, but it is not FDA-approved for this use. Its use is approved for treatment of fibromyalgia as a secondary painkiller by the NHS.

Its analgesic effects take approximately an hour to be realized, and it takes from two to four hours to reach peak effect after oral administration with an immediate-release formulation. On a dose-by-dose basis, tramadol has about one-tenth the potency of morphine (thus 100 mg is commensurate with 10 mg morphine but may vary) and is practically equally potent when compared with pethidine and codeine. For moderate pain, its effectiveness is roughly equivalent to that of codeine in low doses and hydrocodone at very high doses. For severe pain, it is less effective than morphine.

Pain-reducing effects last approximately six hours. The potency of analgesia varies considerably as it depends on an individual&#x27;s genetics. People with specific variants of CYP2D6 enzymes may not produce adequate amounts of the active metabolite (desmetramadol) for effective pain control.

Sleep medicine physicians sometimes prescribe tramadol (or other opioid medications) for refractory restless legs syndrome (RLS); that is, RLS that does not respond adequately to treatment with first-line medications such as dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole) or gabapentinoids, often due to augmentation.

==Contraindications==
Individuals with certain genetic variations of CYP2D6 enzymes, which convert tramadol into an inactive molecule, may not experience enough pain relief from tramadol. These genetic polymorphisms are not currently routinely tested for in clinical practice.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Use of tramadol during pregnancy is generally avoided, as it may cause some reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn. A small prospective study in France found, while an increased risk of miscarriages existed, no major malformations were reported in the newborn. Its use during lactation is also generally advised against, but a small trial found that infants breastfed by mothers taking tramadol were exposed to about 2.88% of the dose the mothers were taking. No evidence of this dose harming the newborn was seen.

===Labor and delivery===
Its use as an analgesic during labor is not advised due to its long onset of action (1 hour). The ratio of the mean concentration of the drug in the fetus compared to that of the mother when it is given intramuscularly for labor pains has been estimated to be 1:94.

===Children===
Its use in children is generally advised against, although it may be done under the supervision of a specialist. On 21 September 2015, the FDA started investigating the safety of tramadol in use in persons under the age of 17. The investigation was initiated because some of these people have experienced slowed or difficult breathing. The FDA lists age under 12 years old as a contraindication.

===Elderly===
The risk of opioid-related adverse effects such as respiratory depression, falls, cognitive impairment, and sedation is increased. Tramadol may interact with other medications and increase the risk for adverse events.

===Liver and kidney failure===
The drug should be used with caution in those with liver or kidney failure, due to metabolism in the liver (to the active molecule desmetramadol) and elimination by the kidneys.

==Side effects==

The most common adverse effects of tramadol include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, indigestion, abdominal pain, vertigo, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and headache. Other side effects may result from interactions with other medications. Tramadol has the same dose-dependent adverse effects as morphine including respiratory depression.
===Dependence and withdrawal===
Long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus. Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogs.

==Overdose==
The clinical presentation in overdose cases can vary but typically includes neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations. The predominant neurological symptoms are seizures and altered levels of consciousness, ranging from somnolence to coma. Seizures are particularly notable due to tramadol&#x27;s lowering of the seizure threshold, occurring in approximately half of acute poisoning cases. Patients often exhibit tachycardia and mild hypertension. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting are common, and agitation, anxiety, and cold and clammy skin may also be present.

While less common, severe complications like respiratory depression and serotonin syndrome can occur, particularly in polydrug overdoses involving other CNS depressants (such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and alcohol) and agents with serotonergic activity. Additionally, individuals with genetic variations leading to CYP2D6 enzyme duplication (rapid metabolizers) may have an increased risk of adverse effects, due to faster conversion of tramadol to its active metabolite.

Acute tramadol overdose is generally not life-threatening, with most fatalities resulting from polysubstance overdose. Management includes cardiovascular monitoring, activated charcoal administration, hydration, and treatment of seizures. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can partially reverse some effects of tramadol overdose, particularly respiratory depression. However, its use may increase the risk of seizures due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. For suspected serotonin syndrome, cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist, is considered an effective antidote.

The incidence of tramadol-related overdose deaths has been on the rise in certain regions. For instance, Northern Ireland has reported an increased frequency of such cases. In 2013, England and Wales recorded 254 tramadol-related deaths, while Florida reported 379 cases in 2011. In 2011, 21,649 emergency room visits in the United States were related to tramadol. The likely explanation for these observations is due to increase in frequency of prescriptions and use due to easier access due to lighter regulatory scheduling by authorities but this is starting to change. In 2021, Health Canada announced tramadol would be added to Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to the Narcotic Control Regulations due to tramadol being suspected of having contributed to 18 reported deaths in Canada between 2006 and 2017.

==Interactions==
Tramadol can have pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic interactions.

Tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes which contributes to the metabolism of approximately 25% of all medications. Any medications with the ability to inhibit or induce these enzymes may interact with tramadol. These include common antiarrhythmics, antiemetics, antidepressants (sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine in particular), antipsychotics, analgesics, and tamoxifen.

Due to tramadol&#x27;s serotonergic effects, tramadol has the potential to contribute to the development of an acute or chronic hyper-serotonin state called serotonin syndrome when used concurrently with other pro-serotonergic medications such as antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics, MAOIs), antipsychotics, triptans, cold medications containing dextromethorphan, and some herbal products such as St. John&#x27;s wort.

Concurrent use of 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron may reduce the effectiveness of both drugs.

Tramadol also acts as an opioid agonist and thus can increase the risk for side effects when used with other opioid and opioid-containing analgesics (such as morphine, pethidine, tapentadol, oxycodone, fentanyl, and Tylenol 3).

Tramadol increases the risk for seizures by lowering the seizure threshold. Using other medications that lower seizure threshold - such as antipsychotic medications, bupropion (an anti-depressant and smoking cessation drug), and amphetamines - can further increase this risk.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Tramadol induces analgesic effects through a variety of different targets on the noradrenergic system, serotonergic system, and opioid receptors system. Tramadol affects serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition similarly to certain antidepressants known as serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as venlafaxine and duloxetine. Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture, the positive enantiomer inhibits serotonin reuptake while the negative enantiomer inhibits noradrenaline re-uptake, by binding to and blocking the transporters. Both enantiomers of tramadol are agonists of the μ-opioid receptor and its M1 metabolite, O-desmetramadol, is also a μ-opioid receptor agonist but is 6 times more potent than tramadol itself. All of these actions may work synergistically to induce analgesia.

Tramadol has been found to possess these actions:
* Agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and to a far lesser extent of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and κ-opioid receptor (KOR)
* Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; hence, an SNRI
* Serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist
* M1 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
* α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
* NMDA receptor antagonist (very weak)
* TRPA1 inhibitor

Tramadol acts on the opioid receptors through its major active metabolite desmetramadol, which has as much as 700-fold higher affinity for the MOR relative to tramadol. Moreover, tramadol itself has been found to possess no efficacy in activating the MOR in functional activity assays, whereas desmetramadol activates the receptor with high intrinsic activity (Emax equal to that of morphine). As such, desmetramadol is exclusively responsible for the opioid effects of tramadol. Both tramadol and desmetramadol have pronounced selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR in terms of binding affinity.

Tramadol is well-established as an SRI. In addition, a few studies have found that it also acts as a serotonin releasing agent (1–10 μM), similar in effect to fenfluramine. The serotonin releasing effects of tramadol could be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine, which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents such as fenfluramine and MDMA. However, two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of tramadol at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30 μM. In addition to serotonergic activity, tramadol is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is not a norepinephrine releasing agent. Tramadol does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dopamine.

A positron emission tomography imaging study found that single oral 50-mg and 100-mg doses of tramadol to human volunteers resulted in 34.7% and 50.2% respective mean occupation of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the thalamus. The estimated median effective dose (ED50) for SERT occupancy hence was 98.1 mg, which was associated with a plasma tramadol level of about 330 ng/mL (1,300 nM). The estimated maximum daily dosage of tramadol of 400 mg (100 mg ) would result in as much as 78.7% occupancy of the SERT (in association with a plasma concentration of 1,220 ng/mL or 4,632 nM). This is close to that of SSRIs, which occupy the SERT by 80% or more.

Peak plasma concentrations during treatment with clinical dosages of tramadol have generally been found to be in the range of 70 to 592 ng/mL (266–2,250 nM) for tramadol and 55 to 143 ng/mL (221–573 nM) for desmetramadol. The highest levels of tramadol were observed with the maximum oral daily dosage of 400 mg per day divided into one 100-mg dose every 6 hours (i.e., four 100-mg doses evenly spaced out per day). Some accumulation of tramadol occurs with chronic administration; peak plasma levels with the maximum oral daily dosage (100 mg ) are about 16% higher and the area-under-the-curve levels 36% higher than following a single oral 100-mg dose. Positron emission tomography imaging studies have reportedly found that tramadol levels are at least four-fold higher in the brain than in plasma. Conversely, brain levels of desmetramadol &quot;only slowly approach those in plasma&quot;. The plasma protein binding of tramadol is only 4–20%; hence, almost all tramadol in circulation is free, thus bioactive.

====Correspondence to effects====
Co-administration of quinidine, a potent CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor, with tramadol, a combination which results in markedly reduced levels of desmetramadol, was found not to significantly affect the analgesic effects of tramadol in human volunteers. However, other studies have found that the analgesic effects of tramadol are significantly decreased or even absent in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The analgesic effects of tramadol are only partially reversed by naloxone in human volunteers, hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole factor; tramadol&#x27;s analgesic effects are also partially reversed by α2-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as yohimbine, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, and the 5-HT7 receptor antagonists SB-269970 and SB-258719. Pharmacologically, tramadol is similar to tapentadol and methadone in that it not only binds to the MOR, but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its &quot;atypical&quot; opioid activity.

Tramadol has inhibitory actions on the 5-HT2C receptor. Antagonism of 5-HT2C could be partially responsible for tramadol&#x27;s reducing effect on depressive and obsessive–compulsive symptoms in patients with pain and co-morbid neurological illnesses. 5-HT2C blockade may also account for its lowering of the seizure threshold, as 5-HT2C knockout mice display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures, sometimes resulting in spontaneous death. However, the reduction of seizure threshold could be attributed to tramadol&#x27;s putative inhibition of GABAA receptors at high doses (significant inhibition at 100 μM). In addition, desmetramadol is a high-affinity ligand of the DOR, and activation of this receptor could be involved in tramadol&#x27;s ability to provoke seizures in some individuals, as DOR agonists are well known for inducing seizures.

Nausea and vomiting caused by tramadol are thought to be due to activation of the 5-HT3 receptor via increased serotonin levels. In accordance, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron can be used to treat tramadol-associated nausea and vomiting. Tramadol and desmetramadol themselves do not bind to the 5-HT3 receptor.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Tramadol is metabolised in the liver via the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, being &quot;O&quot;- and &quot;N&quot;-demethylated to five different metabolites. Of these, desmetramadol (&quot;O&quot;-desmethyltramadol) is the most significant, since it has 200 times the μ-affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of 9 hours, compared with 6 hours for tramadol itself. As with codeine, in the 6% of the population who have reduced CYP2D6 activity (hence reducing metabolism), a reduced analgesic effect is seen. Those with decreased CYP2D6 activity require a dose increase of 30% to achieve the same degree of pain relief as those with a normal level of CYP2D6 activity.

Phase II hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble, which are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, reduced doses may be used in renal and hepatic impairment.

Its volume of distribution is around 306 L after oral administration and 203 L after parenteral administration.

==Chemistry==
Tramadol is marketed as a racemic mixture of both &quot;R&quot;- and &quot;S&quot;-stereoisomers, because the two isomers complement each other&#x27;s analgesic activities. The (+)-isomer is predominantly active as an opiate with a higher affinity for the μ-opiate receptor (20 times higher affinity than the (-)-isomer).

===Synthesis and stereoisomerism===

The chemical synthesis of tramadol is described in the literature. Tramadol has two stereogenic centers at the cyclohexane ring. Thus, may exist in &quot;four&quot; different configurational forms:
* (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer
* (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-isomer
* (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-isomer
* (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer
The synthetic pathway leads to the racemate (1:1 mixture) of (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer and the (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-isomer as the main products. Minor amounts of the racemic mixture of the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-isomer and the (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer are formed as well. The isolation of the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer and the (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-isomer from the diastereomeric minor racemate [(1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-isomer and (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-isomer] is realized by the recrystallization of the hydrochlorides.
The drug tramadol is a racemate of the hydrochlorides of the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-(+)- and the (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-(−)-enantiomers.
The resolution of the racemate [(1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-(+)-isomer / (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-(−)-isomer] was described employing (&quot;R&quot;)-(−)- or (&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-mandelic acid. This process does not find industrial application, since tramadol is used as a racemate, despite known different physiological effects of the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)- and (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-isomers, because the racemate showed higher analgesic activity than either enantiomer in animals and in humans.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Tramadol and desmetramadol may be quantified in blood, plasma, serum, or saliva to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a sudden death. Most commercial opiate immunoassay screening tests do not cross-react significantly with tramadol or its major metabolites, so chromatographic techniques must be used to detect and quantify these substances. The concentration of desmetramadol in the blood or plasma of a person who has taken tramadol is generally 10–20% that of the parent drug.

===Discrepant reports on natural agency===

In 2013, researchers Michel de Waard (then at Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble and Grenoble Institute of Neuroscience, La Tronche) reported in &quot;Angewandte Chemie&quot; that tramadol was found in relatively high concentrations (&gt;1%) in the roots of the African pin cushion tree, &quot;Nauclea latifolia&quot;, concluding that it was a natural product in addition to its being a later human synthetic, and presenting a putative biosynthetic hypothesis for its origin. 

In 2014, Michael Spiteller (Technische Universität Dortmund) and collaborators reported results, also in &quot;Angewandte Chemie&quot;, that supported the conclusion that the presence of tramadol in those tree roots was the result of tramadol having been ingested by humans and having been administered to cattle (by farmers in the region); Spiteller et al. presented data that tramadol and its metabolites were present in animal excreta, which they then argue contaminated soil around the trees. They further observed that tramadol and its mammalian metabolites were found in tree roots in the far north of Cameroon where the commercial drug was in use, but not in the south where it was not being administered.

A news report appearing in &quot;Lab Times&quot; at the time of the latter, 2014 paper, and reporting on its contents, also reported that Michel de Waard (communicating author of the original paper) continued to contest the notion that tramadol in tree roots was the result of anthropogenic contamination. The point was made that samples were taken from trees that grew in national parks, where livestock were forbidden, and it quoted de Waard extensively, who stated that &quot;thousands and thousands of tramadol-treated cattle sitting around a single tree and urinating&quot; would be required to produce the concentrations discovered.

In 2016, Spiteller and colleagues followed up their preceding work with a radiocarbon analysis that supported their contention that the tramadol found in &quot;N. latifolia&quot; roots was of human synthetic origin rather being plant-derived.

==Society and culture==

===Formulations===
Available dosage forms include liquids, syrups, drops, elixirs, effervescent tablets, and powders for mixing with water, capsules, tablets including extended-release formulations, suppositories, compounding powder, and injections.

===Patent history===
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tramadol in March 1995, and an extended-release (ER) formulation in September 2005. ER Tramadol was protected by US patents nos. 6,254,887 and 7,074,430. The FDA listed the patents&#x27; expiration as 10 May 2014. However, in August 2009, the US District Court for the District of Delaware ruled the patents invalid, a decision upheld the following year by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Manufacture and distribution of generic equivalents of Ultram ER in the United States was therefore permitted before the expiration of the patents.

===Legal status===
Effective August 2014, tramadol has been placed into Schedule IV of the federal Controlled Substances Act in the United States. Before that, some US states had already classified tramadol as a Schedule IV controlled substance under their respective state laws.

Tramadol is classified in Schedule 4 (prescription only) in Australia, rather than as a Schedule 8 Controlled Drug (Possession without authority illegal) like most other opioids.

Effective May 2008, Sweden classified tramadol as a controlled substance in the same category as codeine and dextropropoxyphene, but allows a normal prescription to be used.

In June 2014, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Home Office classified tramadol as a Class C, Schedule 3 controlled drug, but exempted it from the safe custody requirement.

In October 2023, New Zealand&#x27;s Medsafe reclassified tramadol as a Class C2 Controlled Drug (in addition to its existing status as a prescription only medication).

===Misuse===
Illicit use of the drug is thought to be a major factor in the success of the Boko Haram terrorist organization. When used at higher doses, the drug &quot;can produce similar effects to heroin.&quot; One former member said, &quot;whenever we took tramadol, nothing mattered to us anymore except what we were sent to do because it made us very high and very bold, it was impossible to go on a mission without taking it.&quot; Tramadol is also used as a coping mechanism in the Gaza Strip under Israeli siege. It is also abused in the United Kingdom, inspiring the title of the TV show &quot;Frankie Boyle&#x27;s Tramadol Nights&quot; (2010).

From March 2019, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) banned the drug, after riders were using the painkiller to improve their performance.

==Research==

<text>Christian Friedrich Henrici (January 14, 1700 – May 10, 1764), writing under the pen name Picander, was a German poet and librettist for many of the cantatas which Johann Sebastian Bach composed in Leipzig.

Henrici was born in Stolpen. He studied law at Wittenberg and Leipzig. He wrote to supplement his income from tutoring and continued even after obtaining regular employment as a civil servant.

== Librettist for Johann Sebastian Bach ==
Bach moved to Leipzig in 1723. There is uncertainty as to who was writing the libretti he set during his first years in the city. The authors of the libretti for the Chorale cantata cycle of 1724/25 are anonymous. By 1725, Henrici and Bach were working together. Some of Bach&#x27;s most important works used Henrici&#x27;s libretti. Most notably their collaboration was on religious works in a Lutheran tradition such as the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; (BWV 244). However, they also produced secular works such as the &quot;Shepherds&#x27; Cantata&quot; of 1725 and the later &quot;Coffee Cantata&quot; and &quot;Peasant Cantata&quot;.

=== &quot;Sammlung Erbaulicher Gedanken&quot; ===
For a year from the start of Advent 1724 Picander had published spiritual poetry in weekly editions, which he collected in 1725 as &quot;Sammlung Erbaulicher Gedanken&quot;. This caught Bach&#x27;s eye who started using Picander&#x27;s poetry for his cantatas from 1725, and used poems from Picander&#x27;s first collection in his &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;.

=== &quot;Ernst-Schertzhaffte und Satyrische Gedichte&quot; ===
All volumes of Picander&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (Leipzig, 1727–51) contain texts set to music by J. S. Bach, including those for the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; and its associated funeral music for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen (&quot;Klagt, Kinder, klagt es aller Welt&quot;, BWV 244a).

Volumes and editions:
* Vol. I: 1727, reprinted in 1732 and 1736.
* Vol. II: 1729, reprinted in 1734.
* Vol. III: 1732, reprinted in 1737. This volume contained texts published in 1728 as &quot;Cantaten auf die Sonn- und Fest-Tage durch das gantze Jahr&quot;.
* Vol. IV: 1737.
* Reworked fourth edition, containing a selection of previous editions, in two volumes: 1748.
* Vol. V: 1751.

===Lost scores and reconstructions===
In some cases, Henrici&#x27;s texts have survived and Bach&#x27;s settings have not. The lost scores include cases where the music has vanished without trace and others where there are clues as to what music Bach used to set the words, allowing the possibility of reconstruction.

====Lost scores====
In the preface to the third volume (1732) Picander claimed that J. S. Bach set a whole cycle of his cantata texts in 1729. Only nine of J. S. Bach&#x27;s settings are known to have survived (they include the cantatas for Christmas &quot;Ehre sei Gott in der Höhe&quot;, BWV 197a, New Year &quot;Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm&quot;, BWV 171, Whit Monday &quot;Ich liebe den Höchsten von ganzem Gemüte&quot;, BWV 174, and the feast of St Michael &quot;Man singet mit Freuden vom Sieg&quot;, BWV 149) the statement made in the preface has been debated.

====Reconstructed scores====
Examples of reconstructions include the funeral music for Prince Leopold and the &quot;St Mark Passion&quot; (BWV 247) where Bach&#x27;s music can be reconstructed because it is known to have been used in surviving pieces. Bach sometimes returned to compositions commissioned for one-off occasions and recycled the music. Picander was able to help the composer in this process by providing metrically similar new texts, effectively setting words to Bach&#x27;s music.

<text>Willis Arnold Gorman (January 12, 1816 – May 20, 1876) was an American lawyer, soldier, politician, and a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Gorman was born near Flemingsburg, Kentucky. He was the only child of David and Elizabeth Gorman, both of Irish descent. In 1835, the family moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where Gorman attended Indiana University and then established a law practice. In January 1836, he married Martha Stone in Bloomington. By 1837 he began his move into politics, becoming a clerk in the Indiana State Senate. From 1841 to 1844, he was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives.

In 1845 he returned to Indiana University and completed his law degree. In 1846 he volunteered for the army, enlisted as a private, and went to fight in the Mexican–American War. He was appointed as a major in the 3rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and led an independent rifle battalion at the Battle of Buena Vista, where he was severely wounded. When his term of service expired, he re-enlisted and was appointed colonel of the 4th Indiana. He served in the capture of Huamantla and in several other campaigns and battles under General Joseph Lane. In 1848 he was civil and military governor of Puebla, but soon after he returned to Indiana. He served in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1853, as a representative of that state.

Gorman, politically a Democrat, served as the second Territorial Governor of Minnesota from May 15, 1853, to April 23, 1857, at the appointment of President Franklin Pierce. During his time as Governor of Minnesota, he masterminded an unsuccessful plan to move the capital of the territory from St. Paul to St. Peter, where he owned land that would have been eminently suitable for use as the new capitol grounds. The plan was sidetracked when legislator Joe Rolette disappeared with the bill until the last seconds of the legislative session.

He spent a number of years practicing law in St. Paul, Minnesota, and served in the Minnesota House of Representatives from May 11, 1858, to January 1859.

With the secession of several Southern slave states, Gorman offered his services to the army. He was appointed Colonel of the 1st Minnesota Infantry, serving in the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861. On September 7, 1861, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and assigned to command a brigade in the II Corps in Army of the Potomac during the Peninsular Campaign. His troops suffered high casualties during the Battle of Antietam in an ill-fated attack on Confederate positions in the West Woods. Later in the year, he was assigned to command the District of Eastern Arkansas.

==Postwar==
In 1864 he left the service and resumed his law practice in St. Paul. He was elected City attorney in 1869, and continued in that position until his death. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery in St. Paul.

<text>Samuel Medary (February 25, 1801 – November 7, 1864) was an American newspaper owner and politician.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, he settled in Bethel, Ohio, in 1825. After a term in the Ohio House of Representatives (1834) and the Ohio State Senate (1836–38) as a Jackson Democrat, he purchased a newspaper in Columbus that became the &quot;Ohio Statesman&quot;, which he edited until 1857. He was active at the National Democratic Conventions at Baltimore in 1844, where he was instrumental in the nomination of James K. Polk; and at Cincinnati in 1856, where he was the President pro tem. President James Buchanan appointed him as the third Territorial Governor of Minnesota from April 23, 1857, to May 24, 1858. Minnesota became a state on May 11, 1858, and elected Henry Hastings Sibley as the state&#x27;s first governor.

Samuel Medary was also Governor of Kansas Territory from December 1858 to December 1860. William F. Wheeler was territory Librarian and the Governor&#x27;s Secretary while in office.

Returning to Columbus, Ohio, he established a newspaper he named &quot;The Crisis&quot;. While living in Columbus, Medary resided at his estate, Northwood Place, located along the Worthington Pike, now North High Street, near Northwood Avenue. Medary was indicted by a federal grand jury in 1864 for conspiracy against the government and was arrested. He was released on bond, but died in Columbus, Ohio before he could be tried.

==Legacy==
One of the first townsites in Dakota Territory is named after Medary. The town of Medaryville, Indiana, was also named after him. In North Columbus, Ohio (annexed to the city of Columbus in the late 1800s), a street dating back to the early 1900s Medary Avenue was named for him. Because Columbus Public Schools names its schools for the street on which they are located, Medary Elementary School also carried his surname.

Medary was buried at Green Lawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio.

<text>NGC 604 is an H II region inside the Triangulum Galaxy. It was discovered by William Herschel on September 11, 1784. It is among the largest H II regions in the Local Group of galaxies; at the galaxy&#x27;s estimated distance of 2.7 million light-years, its longest diameter is roughly 1,520 light years (~460 parsecs), over 40 times the size of the visible portion of the Orion Nebula. It is over 6,300 times more luminous than the Orion Nebula, and if it were at the same distance it would outshine Venus. Its gas is ionized by a cluster of massive stars at its center with 200 stars of spectral type O and WR, a mass of 105 solar masses, and an age of 3.5 million years; however, unlike the Large Magellanic Cloud&#x27;s Tarantula Nebula central cluster (R136), NGC 604&#x27;s one is much less compact and more similar to a large stellar association.

<doc id="250879" wikidata="Q17197559" url="?curid=250879" title="Contract killing">
<text>Contract killing (also known as murder-for-hire) is a form of murder or assassination in which one party hires another party to kill a targeted person or people. It involves an illegal agreement which includes some form of compensation, monetary or otherwise. Either party may be a person, group, or organization. Contract killing has been associated with organized crime, government conspiracies, dictatorships, and vendettas.

Contract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing, making it more difficult for law enforcement to connect the client with the murder. The likelihood that authorities will establish that party&#x27;s guilt for the committed crime, especially due to lack of forensic evidence linked to the contracting party, makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party. Contract killers may exhibit serial killer traits, but are generally not classified as such because of third-party killing objectives and detached financial and emotional incentives. Nevertheless, there are occasionally individuals that are labeled as both contract killers and serial killers.

A contract killer is colloquially known as a hitman.

==Statistics==
A study by the Australian Institute of Criminology of 162 contract murders and attempted contract murders in Australia between 1989 and 2002 indicated that the most common reason for murder-for-hire was insurance policy payouts. The study also found that payments varied from $5,000 to $30,000 per killing, with an average of $15,000, and that the most commonly used weapons were firearms. Contract killings accounted for 2% of murders in Australia during that time period.
Contract killings generally make up a small percentage of murders. For example, they accounted for about 7% of all murders in Scotland from 1993 to 2002.

<text>The Red Spider Nebula (also catalogued as &quot;NGC 6537&quot;) is a planetary nebula located near the heart of the Milky Way, in the northwest of the constellation Sagittarius. The nebula has a prominent two-lobed shape, possibly due to a binary companion or magnetic fields and has an S-shaped symmetry of the lobes – the lobes opposite each other appear similar. This is believed to be due to the presence of a companion to the central white dwarf. However, the gas walls of the two lobed structures are not at all smooth, but rather are rippled in a complex way.

The central white dwarf, the remaining compact core of the original star, produces a powerful and hot (≈10,000 K) wind blowing with a speed of 300 kilometers per second, which has generated waves 100 billion kilometres high. The waves are generated by supersonic shocks formed when the local gas is compressed and heated in front of the rapidly expanding lobes. Atoms caught in the shocks radiate a visible light. These winds are what give this nebula its unique &#x27;spider&#x27; shape and also contribute to the expansion of the nebula.

The star at the center of the Red Spider Nebula is surrounded by a dust shell making its exact properties hard to determine. Its surface temperature is probably 150,000–250,000 K, although a temperature of 340,000 K or even 500,000 K is not ruled out, making it among the hottest white dwarf stars known.

The Red Spider Nebula lies near the constellation of Sagittarius. Its distance has been variously estimated as 1,900 light-years or, more likely, 3,000–8,000 light-years.

<text>The Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula (also known as NGC 6543 and [[Caldwell catalogue|Caldwell]] 6) is a planetary nebula in the northern constellation of Draco, discovered by William Herschel on February 15, 1786. It was the first planetary nebula whose spectrum was investigated by the English amateur astronomer William Huggins, demonstrating that planetary nebulae were gaseous and not stellar in nature. Structurally, the object has had high-resolution images by the Hubble Space Telescope revealing knots, jets, bubbles and complex arcs, being illuminated by the central hot planetary nebula nucleus (PNN).
It is a well-studied object that has been observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths. At the centre of the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula is a dying Wolf Rayet star, the sort of which can be seen in the Webb Telescope&#x27;s image of WR 124. The Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula&#x27;s central star shines at magnitude +11.4. Hubble Space Telescope images show a sort of dart board pattern of concentric rings emanating outwards from the centre.

==General information==
NGC 6543 is a high northern declination deep-sky object. It has the combined magnitude of 8.1, with high surface brightness. Its small bright inner nebula subtends an average of 16.1 arcsec, with the outer prominent condensations about 25 arcsec. Deep images reveal an extended halo about 300 arcsec or 5 arcminutes across, that was once ejected by the central progenitor star during its red giant phase.

NGC 6543 is 4.4 minutes of arc from the current position of the north ecliptic pole, less than of the 45 arcminutes between Polaris and the current location of the Earth&#x27;s northern axis of rotation. It is a convenient and accurate marker for the axis of rotation of the Earth&#x27;s ecliptic, around which the celestial North Pole rotates. It is also a good marker for the nearby &quot;invariable&quot; axis of the solar system, which is the center of the circles which &quot;every&quot; planet&#x27;s north pole, and the north pole of every planet&#x27;s orbit, make in the sky. Since motion in the sky of the ecliptic pole is very slow compared to the motion of the Earth&#x27;s north pole, its position as an ecliptic pole station marker is essentially permanent on the time-scale of human history, as opposed to the pole star, which changes every few thousand years.

Observations show the bright nebulosity has temperatures between and , whose densities average of about particles per cubic centimetre. Its outer halo has the higher temperature around , but is of much lower density. Velocity of the fast stellar wind is about , where spectroscopic analysis shows the current rate of mass loss averages solar masses per year, equivalent to twenty trillion tons per second (20 Eg/s).
Surface temperature for the central PNN is about , being 10,000 times as luminous as the sun. Stellar classification is O7 + [WR]-type star. Calculations suggest the PNN is over one solar mass, from a theoretical initial 5 solar masses. The central Wolf–Rayet star has a radius of (452,000 km). The Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula, given in some sources, lies about three thousand light-years from Earth.

==Observations==
The Cat&#x27;s Eye was the first planetary nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins&#x27; observations revealed that the nebula&#x27;s spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths have been used to reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.

===Infrared observations===
Observations of NGC 6543 at far-infrared wavelengths (about 60 μm) reveal the presence of stellar dust at low temperatures. The dust is believed to have formed during the last phases of the progenitor star&#x27;s life. It absorbs light from the central star and re-radiates it at infrared wavelengths. The spectrum of the infrared dust emission implies that the dust temperature is about 85 K, while the mass of the dust is estimated at solar masses.

Infrared emission also reveals the presence of un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This may be due to shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8 μm) is similar in visible light.

===Optical and ultraviolet observations===
The Hubble Space Telescope image produced here is in false colour, designed to highlight regions of high and low ionisation. Three images were taken, in filters isolating the light emitted by singly ionised hydrogen at 656.3 nm, singly ionised nitrogen at 658.4 nm and doubly ionised oxygen at 500.7 nm. The images were combined as red, green and blue channels respectively, although their true colours are red, red and green. The image reveals two &quot;caps&quot; of less ionised material at the edge of the nebula.

===X-ray observations===

In 2001, observations at X-ray wavelengths by the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed the presence of extremely hot gas within NGC 6543 with the temperature of . It is thought that the very hot gas results from the violent interaction of a fast stellar wind with material previously ejected. This interaction has hollowed out the inner bubble of the nebula. Chandra observations have also revealed a at the position of the central star. The spectrum of this source extends to the hard part of the X-ray spectrum, to 0.5–. A star with the photospheric temperature of about would not be expected to emit strongly in hard X-rays, and so their presence is something of a mystery. It may suggest the presence of a high temperature accretion disk within a binary star system. The hard X-ray data remain intriguing more than ten years later: the Cat&#x27;s Eye was included in a 2012 Chandra survey of 21 central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) in the solar neighborhood, which found: &quot;All but one of the X-ray point sources detected at CSPNe display X-ray spectra that are harder than expected from hot (~) central star photospheres, possibly indicating a high frequency of binary companions to CSPNe. Other potential explanations include self-shocking winds or PN mass fallback.&quot;

==Distance==
Planetary nebulae distances like NGC 6543 are generally very inaccurate and not well known. Some recent Hubble Space Telescope observations of NGC 6543 taken several years apart determine its distance from the angular expansion rate of 3.457 milliarcseconds per year. Assuming a line of sight expansion velocity of 16.4 km·s−1, this implies that NGC 6543&#x27;s distance is  parsecs ( or  light-years) away from Earth. Several other distance references, like what is quoted in SIMBAD in 2014 based on Stanghellini, L., et al. (2008) suggest the distance is parsecs ( light-years).

==Age==
The angular expansion of the nebula can also be used to estimate its age. If it has been expanding at a constant rate of 10 milliarcseconds a year, then it would take to reach a diameter of 20 arcseconds. This may be an upper limit to the age, because ejected material will be slowed when it encounters material ejected from the star at earlier stages of its evolution, and the interstellar medium.

==Composition==
Like most astronomical objects, NGC 6543 consists mostly of hydrogen and helium, with heavier elements present in small quantities. The exact composition may be determined by spectroscopic studies. Abundances are generally expressed relative to hydrogen, the most abundant element.

Different studies generally find varying values for elemental abundances. This is often because spectrographs attached to telescopes do not collect all the light from objects being observed, instead gathering light from a slit or small aperture. Therefore, different observations may sample different parts of the nebula.

However, results for NGC 6543 broadly agree that, relative to hydrogen, the helium abundance is about 0.12, carbon and nitrogen abundances are both about , and the oxygen abundance is about . These are fairly typical abundances for planetary nebulae, with the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances all larger than the values found for the sun, due to the effects of nucleosynthesis enriching the star&#x27;s atmosphere in heavy elements before it is ejected as a planetary nebula.

Deep spectroscopic analysis of NGC 6543 may indicate that the nebula contains a small amount of material which is highly enriched in heavy elements; this is discussed below.

==Kinematics and morphology==
The Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula is structurally a very complex nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that have given rise to its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebula consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas. It, in turn, is nested into a pair of larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their waist. The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.

The structure of the bright portion of the nebula is primarily caused by the interaction of a fast stellar wind being emitted by the central PNN with the visible material ejected during the formation of the nebula. This interaction causes the emission of X-rays discussed above. The stellar wind, blowing with the velocity as high as , has &#x27;hollowed out&#x27; the inner bubble of the nebula, and appears to have burst the bubble at both ends.

It is also suspected that the central WR:+O7 spectral class PNN star, HD 164963 / BD +66 1066 / PPM 20679 of the nebula may be generated by a binary star. The existence of an accretion disk caused by mass transfer between the two components of the system may give rise to astronomical jets, which would interact with previously ejected material. Over time, the direction of the jets would vary due to precession.

Outside the bright inner portion of the nebula, there are a series of concentric rings, thought to have been ejected before the formation of the planetary nebula, while the star was on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. These rings are very evenly spaced, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for their formation ejected them at very regular intervals and at very similar speeds. The total mass of the rings is about 0.1 solar masses. The pulsations that formed the rings probably started 15,000 years ago and ceased about years ago, when the formation of the bright central part began (see above).

Further, a large faint halo extends to large distances from the star. The halo again predates the formation of the main nebula. The mass of the halo is estimated as 0.26–0.92 solar masses.

<text>NGC 2346 is a planetary nebula near the celestial equator in the constellation of Monoceros, less than a degree to the ESE of Delta Monocerotis. It is informally known as the Butterfly Nebula. The nebula is bright and conspicuous with a visual magnitude of 9.6, and has been extensively studied. Among its most remarkable characteristics is its unusually cool central star, which is a spectroscopic binary, and its unusual shape.

The nebular is bipolar in form, with modest outflow velocities in the range of 8–11 km/s, while the center is girded by an expanding belt of molecular gas. The electron density of the nebula is on the order of 400 per cubic centimeter. The ionization of the nebula is the result of ultraviolet emission from the binary companion. The stronger infrared emission from molecular emission is coming from the belt, which is expanding at the rate of . The mass of the molecular gas in the nebula is estimated to be in the range of 0.34–, and is much greater than the mass of the ionized gas.

The central star is a binary star consisting of an A-type subgiant and a subdwarf O star. The system, which has an orbital period of  days, is also variable, probably due to dust in orbit around it. The dust itself is heated by the central star and so NGC 2346 is unusually bright in the infrared part of the spectrum. When one of the two stars evolved into a red giant, it engulfed its companion, which stripped away a ring of material from the larger star&#x27;s atmosphere. When the red giant&#x27;s core was exposed, a fast stellar wind inflated two ‘bubbles’ from either side of the ring.

<doc id="250887" wikidata="Q312544" url="?curid=250887" title="Kanishka">
<text>Kanishka I, also known as Kanishka the Great, was an emperor of the Kushan dynasty, under whose reign (–150 CE) the empire reached its zenith. He is famous for his military, political, and spiritual achievements. A descendant of Kujula Kadphises, founder of the Kushan empire, Kanishka came to rule an empire extending from Central Asia and Gandhara to Pataliputra on the Gangetic plain. The main capital of his empire was located at &quot;Puruṣapura&quot; (Peshawar) in Gandhara, with another major capital at Mathura. Coins of Kanishka were found in Tripuri (present-day Jabalpur).

Although he never converted to the religion, his conquests and patronage of Buddhism played an important role in the development of the Silk Road, and in the transmission of Mahayana Buddhism from Gandhara across the Karakoram range to China. Around 127 CE, he replaced Greek with Bactrian as the official language of administration in the empire.

Earlier scholars believed that Kanishka ascended the Kushan throne in 78 CE, and that this date was used as the beginning of the Saka calendar era. However, historians no longer regard this date as that of Kanishka&#x27;s accession. Falk estimates that Kanishka came to the throne in 127 CE.

== Genealogy ==

There are two theories about Kanisha&#x27;s origins, both based on the supposition of a separate Kanishka dynasty. The earlier Sten Konow&#x27;s is that Kanishka came from Khotan, having been summoned as an ethnic ally at the time of troubles after Vima&#x27;s reign. Konow supports this theory by citing a Tibetan tradition that a Khotanese expedition to India of about A.D. 120 was commanded by a King &quot;Vijayakirti&quot; along with a King &quot;Kanika&quot; and the king of &quot;Guzan&quot;.

Roman Ghirshman&#x27;s similar theory is that Kanishka was originally king of Kashmir before becoming suzerain of the dynasty as a whole. He cites the above-mentioned Khalatse epigraph, which may allude to Kushan power reaching the northeast corner of Kashmir, and also the Rajatarangini, in which the list of Kushan kings of Kashmir gave Kanishka&#x27;s name as the third of a sequence, along with the names of &quot;Hushka&quot; and &quot;Jushka&quot;. Finally, testimony of Kanishka&#x27;s activity in Kashmir in favor of the Buddhist faith suggests that he favored the region above others and that he founded Peshawar as his capital to be close to Kashmir.

He was of Yuezhi ethnicity and his native language was probably Tocharian. Kanishka was the successor of Vima Kadphises, as demonstrated by an impressive genealogy of the Kushan kings, known as the Rabatak inscription. The connection of Kanishka with other Kushan rulers is described in the Rabatak inscription as Kanishka makes the list of the kings who ruled up to his time: Kujula Kadphises as his great-grandfather, Vima Taktu as his grandfather, Vima Kadphises as his father, and himself Kanishka: &quot;for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and *also for himself, King Kanishka&quot;.

== Conquests in India and Central Asia ==
Kanishka&#x27;s empire was certainly vast. It extended from southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, north of the Amu Darya (Oxus) in the north west to Northern India, as far as Mathura in the south east (the Rabatak inscription even claims he held Pataliputra and Sri Champa), and his territory also included Kashmir, where there was a town Kanishkapur (modern day Kanispora), named after him not far from the Baramulla Pass and which still contains the base of a large stupa. The Buddhist text &quot;Śrīdharmapiṭakanidānasūtra&quot;—known via a Chinese translation made in AD 472—refers to the conquest of Pataliputra by Kanishka.

Knowledge of his hold over Central Asia is less well established. The &quot;Hou Hanshu&quot;, states that general Ban Chao fought battles near Khotan with a Kushan army of 70,000 men led by an otherwise unknown Kushan viceroy named Xie () in 90 AD. Ban Chao claimed to be victorious, forcing the Kushans to retreat by use of a scorched-earth policy. The territories of Kashgar, Khotan and Yarkand were Chinese dependencies in the Tarim Basin, modern Xinjiang. Several coins of Kanishka have been found in the Tarim Basin.

Kanishka possibly fought off an invasion by the Parthian Empire in his reign. The war is attested in a single source, a Chinese translation of a lost Sanskrit original, &quot;A History of the Buddha&#x27;s Successors&quot;.

== Kanishka&#x27;s coins ==
Kanishka&#x27;s coins portray images of Indian, Greek, Iranian and even Sumero-Elamite divinities, demonstrating the religious syncretism in his beliefs. Kanishka&#x27;s coins from the beginning of his reign bear legends in Greek language and script and depict Greek divinities. Later coins bear legends in Bactrian, the Iranian language that the Kushans evidently spoke, and Greek divinities were replaced by corresponding Iranian ones. All of Kanishka&#x27;s coins – even ones with a legend in the Bactrian language – were written in a modified Greek script that had one additional glyph (Ϸ) to represent /š/ (&quot;sh&quot;), as in the word &#x27;Ku&quot;sh&quot;an&#x27; and &#x27;Kani&quot;sh&quot;ka&#x27;.

On his coins, the king is typically depicted as a bearded man in a long coat and trousers gathered at the ankle, with flames emanating from his shoulders. He wears large rounded boots, and is armed with a long sword as well as a lance. He is frequently seen to be making a sacrifice on a small altar. The lower half of a lifesize limestone relief of Kanishka similarly attired, with a stiff embroidered surplice beneath his coat and spurs attached to his boots under the light gathered folds of his trousers, survived in the Kabul Museum until it was destroyed by the Taliban.

=== Hellenistic phase ===

A few coins at the beginning of his reign have a legend in the Greek language and script: , &quot;[coin] of Kanishka, king of kings.&quot; 
Greek deities, with Greek names are represented on these early coins:
* (, Hēlios), (, Hephaistos), (, Selene), (, Anemos)

The inscriptions in Greek are full of spelling and syntactical errors.

=== Iranian / Indic phase ===
Following the transition to the Bactrian language on coins, Iranian and Indic divinities replace the Greek ones:

* ΑΡΔΟΧ&quot;Ϸ&quot;Ο (&quot;ardoxsho&quot;, Ashi Vanghuhi)
* ΛΡΟΟΑΣΠΟ (&quot;lrooaspo&quot;, Drvaspa)
* ΑΘ&quot;Ϸ&quot;Ο (&quot;adsho&quot;, Atar)
* ΦΑΡΡΟ (&quot;pharro&quot;, personified khwarenah)
* ΜΑΟ (&quot;mao&quot;, Mah)
* ΜΙΘΡΟ, ΜΙΙΡΟ, ΜΙΟΡΟ, ΜΙΥΡΟ (&quot;mithro&quot;, &quot;miiro&quot;, &quot;mioro&quot;, &quot;miuro&quot;, variants of Mithra)
* ΜΟΖΔΟΟΑΝΟ (&quot;mozdaooano&quot;, &quot;Mazda the victorious?&quot;)
* ΝΑΝΑ, ΝΑΝΑΙΑ, ΝΑΝΑ&quot;Ϸ&quot;ΑΟ (variants of pan-Asiatic &quot;Nana&quot;, Sogdian &quot;nny&quot;, in a Zoroastrian context Aredvi Sura Anahita)
* ΜΑΝΑΟΒΑΓΟ (&quot;manaobago&quot;, Vohu Manah )
* ΟΑΔΟ (&quot;oado&quot;, Vata)
* ΟΡΑΛΑΓΝΟ (&quot;orlagno&quot;, Verethragna)

Only a few Buddhist divinities were used as well:
* ΒΟΔΔΟ (&quot;boddo&quot;, Buddha),
* &quot;Ϸ&quot;ΑΚΑΜΑΝΟ ΒΟΔΔΟ (&quot;shakamano boddho&quot;, Shakyamuni Buddha)
* ΜΕΤΡΑΓΟ ΒΟΔΔΟ (&quot;metrago boddo&quot;, the bodhisattava Maitreya)

Only a few Hindu divinities were used as well:
* ΟΗ&quot;Ϸ&quot;Ο (&quot;oesho&quot;, Shiva). A recent study indicate that &quot;oesho&quot; may be Avestan Vayu conflated with Shiva.

== Kanishka and Buddhism ==
In Buddhist tradition Kanishka is regarded as of utmost importance. Although he never converted to Buddhism, he encouraged its teachings and provided royal sponsorship. Notably, he administered the 4th Buddhist Council in Kashmir as the head of the council. It was presided by Vasumitra and Ashwaghosha. Images of the Buddha based on 32 physical signs were made during his time.

He encouraged both the Gandhara school of Greco-Buddhist Art and the Mathura school of art (an inescapable religious syncretism pervades Kushana rule). Kanishka personally seems to have embraced both Buddhism and the Persian attributes but he favored Buddhism, proven by his devotion to Buddhist teachings and prayer styles depicted in various books related to kushan empire.

His greatest contribution to Buddhist architecture was the Kanishka stupa at Purushapura, modern day Peshawar. Archaeologists who rediscovered the base of it in 1908–1909 estimated that this stupa had a diameter of 286 feet (87 metres). Reports of Chinese pilgrims such as Xuanzang indicate that its height was 600 to 700 (Chinese) &quot;feet&quot; (= roughly 180–210 metres or 591–689 ft.) and it was covered with jewels.

Kanishka is said to have been particularly close to the Buddhist scholar Ashvaghosha, who became his religious advisor in his later years.

=== Buddhist coinage ===
The Buddhist coins of Kanishka are comparatively rare (well under one percent of all known coins of Kanishka). Several show Kanishka on the obverse and the Buddha standing on the reverse. A few also show the Shakyamuni Buddha and Maitreya. Like all coins of Kanishka, the design is rather rough and proportions tend to be imprecise; the image of the Buddha is often slightly overdone, with oversize ears and feet spread apart in the same fashion as the Kushan king.

Three types of Kanishka&#x27;s Buddhist coins are known:

==== Standing Buddha ====

Only six Kushan coins of the Buddha are known in gold (the sixth one is the centerpiece of an ancient piece of jewellery, consisting of a Kanishka Buddha coin decorated with a ring of heart-shaped ruby stones). All these coins were minted in gold under Kanishka I, and are in two different denominations: a dinar of about 8 gm, roughly similar to a Roman aureus, and a quarter dinar of about 2 gm. (about the size of an obol).

The Buddha is represented wearing the monastic robe, the &quot;antaravasaka&quot;, the &quot;uttarasanga&quot;, and the overcoat &quot;sanghati&quot;.

The ears are extremely large and long, a symbolic exaggeration possibly rendered necessary by the small size of the coins, but otherwise visible in some later Gandharan statues of the Buddha typically dated to the 3rd–4th century CE (&quot;illustration, left&quot;). He has an abundant topknot covering the usnisha, often highly stylised in a curly or often globular manner, also visible on later Buddha statues of Gandhara.

In general, the representation of the Buddha on these coins is already highly symbolic, and quite distinct from the more naturalistic and Hellenistic images seen in early Gandhara sculptures. On several designs a mustache is apparent. The palm of his right hand bears the Chakra mark, and his brow bear the urna. An aureola, formed by one, two or three lines, surrounds him.

The full gown worn by the Buddha on the coins, covering both shoulders, suggests a Gandharan model rather than a Mathuran one.

==== &quot;Shakyamuni Buddha&quot; ====

The Shakyamuni Buddha (with the legend &quot;Sakamano Boudo&quot;, i.e. Shakamuni Buddha, another name for the historic Buddha Siddharta Gautama), standing to front, with left hand on hip and forming the abhaya mudra with the right hand. All these coins are in copper only, and usually rather worn.

The gown of the Shakyamuni Buddha is quite light compared to that on the coins in the name of Buddha, clearly showing the outline of the body, in a nearly transparent way. These are probably the first two layers of monastic clothing the &quot;antaravasaka&quot; and the &quot;uttarasanga&quot;. Also, his gown is folded over the left arm (rather than being held in the left hand as above), a feature only otherwise known in the Bimaran casket and suggestive of a scarf-like &quot;uttariya&quot;. He has an abundant topknot covering the ushnisha, and a simple or double halo, sometimes radiating, surrounds his head.

==== &quot;Maitreya Buddha&quot; ====

The Bodhisattva Maitreya (with the legend &quot;Metrago Boudo&quot;) cross-legged on a throne, holding a water pot, and also forming the Abhaya mudra. These coins are only known in copper and are quite worn out .
On the clearest coins, Maitreya seems to be wearing the armbands of an Indian prince, a feature often seen on the statuary of Maitreya. The throne is decorated with small columns, suggesting that the coin representation of Maitreya was directly copied from pre-existing statuary with such well-known features.

The qualification of &quot;Buddha&quot; for Maitreya is inaccurate, as he is instead a Bodhisattva (he is the Buddha of the future).

The iconography of these three types is very different from that of the other deities depicted in Kanishka&#x27;s coinage. Whether Kanishka&#x27;s deities are all shown from the side, the Buddhas only are shown frontally, indicating that they were copied from contemporary frontal representations of the standing and seated Buddhas in statuary. Both representations of the Buddha and Shakyamuni have both shoulders covered by their monastic gown, indicating that the statues used as models were from the Gandhara school of art, rather than Mathura.

=== Buddhist statuary under Kanishka ===

Several Buddhist statues are directly connected to the reign of Kanishka, such as several Bodhisattva statues from the Art of Mathura, while a few other from Gandhara are inscribed with a date in an era which is now thought to be the Yavana era, starting in 186 to 175 BCE.
=== Kanishka stupa ===
The &quot;Kanishka casket&quot; or &quot;Kanishka reliquary&quot;, dated to the first year of Kanishka&#x27;s reign in 127 CE, was discovered in a deposit chamber under Kanishka stupa, during the archaeological excavations in 1908–1909 in Shah-Ji-Ki-Dheri, just outside the present-day Ganj Gate of the old city of Peshawar. It is today at the Peshawar Museum, and a copy is in the British Museum. It is said to have contained three bone fragments of the Buddha, which are now housed in Mandalay, Burma.

The casket is dedicated in Kharoshthi. The inscription reads:

: &quot;(*mahara)jasa kanishkasa kanishka-pure nagare aya gadha-karae deya-dharme sarva-satvana hita-suhartha bhavatu mahasenasa sagharaki dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kanishkasa vihare mahasenasa sangharame&quot;

The text is signed by the maker, a Greek artist named &quot;Agesilas&quot;, who oversaw work at Kanishka&#x27;s stupas (caitya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realisations at such a late date: &quot;The servant Agisalaos, the superintendent of works at the vihara of Kanishka in the monastery of Mahasena&quot; (&quot;dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kaniskasa vihara mahasenasa sangharame&quot;).

The lid of the casket shows the Buddha on a lotus pedestal, and worshipped by Brahma and Indra. The edge of the lid is decorated by a frieze of flying geese. The body of the casket represents a Kushan monarch, probably Kanishka in person, with the Iranian sun and moon gods on his side. On the sides are two images of a seated Buddha, worshiped by royal figures, can be assumed as Kanishka. A garland, supported by cherubs goes around the scene in typical Hellenistic style.

The attribution of the casket to Kanishka has been recently disputed, essentially on stylistic ground (for example the ruler shown on the casket is not bearded, to the contrary of Kanishka). Instead, the casket is often attributed to Kanishka&#x27;s successor Huvishka.

=== Kanishka in Buddhist tradition ===
In Buddhist tradition, Kanishka is often described as an aggressive, hot tempered, rigid, strict, and a bit harsh kind of King before he got converted to Buddhism of which he was very fond, and after his conversion to Buddhism, he became an openhearted, benevolent, and faithful ruler. As in the Sri-dharma-pitaka-nidana sutra:
:&quot;At this time the King of Ngan-si (Pahlava) was very aggressive and of a violent nature...There was a bhikshu (monk) arhat who seeing the harsh deeds done by the king wished to make him repent. So by his supernatural force he caused the king to see the torments of hell. The king was terrified and repented and cried terribly and hence dissolved all his negatives within him and got self realised for the first time in life .&quot; &quot;&quot;

Additionally, the arrival of Kanishka was reportedly foretold or was predicted by the Buddha, as well as the construction of his stupa:
:&quot;. . . the Buddha, pointing to a small boy making a mud tope...[said] that on that spot would erect a tope by his name.&quot; &quot;Vinaya sutra&quot;

The same story is repeated in a Khotanese scroll found at Dunhuang, which first described how Kanishka would arrive 400 years after the death of the Buddha. The account also describes how Kanishka came to raise his stupa:
:&quot;A desire thus arose in [Kanishka to build a vast stupa]...at that time the four world-regents learnt the mind of the king. So for his sake they took the form of young boys...[and] began a stūpa of mud...the boys said to [Kanishka] &#x27;We are making the .&#x27;...At that time the boys changed their form...[and] said to him, &#x27;Great king, by you according to the Buddha&#x27;s prophecy is a to be built wholly (?) with a large stūpa and hither relics must be invited which the meritorious good beings...will bring.&quot;

Chinese pilgrims to India, such as Xuanzang, who travelled there around 630 CE also relays the story:
:&quot; became sovereign of all Jambudvīpa (Indian subcontinent) but he did not believe in Karma, but he treated Buddhism with honor and respect as he himself converted to Buddhism intrigued by the teachings and scriptures of it. When he was hunting in the wild country a white hare appeared; the king gave a chase and the hare suddenly disappeared at [the site of the future stupa]...[when the construction of the stūpa was not going as planned] the king lost his patience and took the matter in his own hands and started resurrecting the plans precisely, thus completing the stupas with utmost perfection and perseverance. These two stupas are still in existence and were resorted to for cures by people afflicted with diseases.&quot;
King Kanishka because of his deeds was highly respected, regarded, honored by all the people he ruled and governed and was regarded the greatest king who ever lived because of his kindness, humbleness and sense of equality and self-righteousness among all aspects. Thus such great deeds and character of the king Kanishka made his name immortal and thus he was regarded &quot;THE KING OF KINGS&quot;

=== Transmission of Buddhism to China ===

Buddhist monks from the region of Gandhara played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia from the middle of the 2nd century CE. The Kushan monk, Lokaksema (), became the first translator of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and established a translation bureau at the Chinese capital Loyang. Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges for the following centuries.

Kanishka was probably succeeded by Huvishka. How and when this came about is still uncertain. The inscription on The Sacred Rock of Hunza also shows the signs of Kanishka.

<text>In mathematics, an implicit equation is a relation of the form formula_1 where is a function of several variables (often a polynomial). For example, the implicit equation of the unit circle is formula_2

An implicit function is a function that is defined by an implicit equation, that relates one of the variables, considered as the value of the function, with the others considered as the arguments. For example, the equation formula_3 of the unit circle defines as an implicit function of if , and is restricted to nonnegative values.

The implicit function theorem provides conditions under which some kinds of implicit equations define implicit functions, namely those that are obtained by equating to zero multivariable functions that are continuously differentiable.

==Examples==

===Inverse functions===
A common type of implicit function is an inverse function. Not all functions have a unique inverse function. If is a function of that has a unique inverse, then the inverse function of , called , is the unique function giving a solution of the equation

:formula_4

for in terms of . This solution can then be written as

:formula_5

Defining as the inverse of is an implicit definition. For some functions , can be written out explicitly as a closed-form expression — for instance, if , then . However, this is often not possible, or only by introducing a new notation (as in the product log example below).

Intuitively, an inverse function is obtained from by interchanging the roles of the dependent and independent variables.

Example: The product log is an implicit function giving the solution for of the equation .

===Algebraic functions===

An algebraic function is a function that satisfies a polynomial equation whose coefficients are themselves polynomials. For example, an algebraic function in one variable gives a solution for of an equation

:formula_6

where the coefficients are polynomial functions of . This algebraic function can be written as the right side of the solution equation . Written like this, is a multi-valued implicit function.

Algebraic functions play an important role in mathematical analysis and algebraic geometry. A simple example of an algebraic function is given by the left side of the unit circle equation:

:formula_7

Solving for gives an explicit solution:

:formula_8

But even without specifying this explicit solution, it is possible to refer to the implicit solution of the unit circle equation as , where is the multi-valued implicit function.

While explicit solutions can be found for equations that are quadratic, cubic, and quartic in , the same is not in general true for quintic and higher degree equations, such as

:formula_9

Nevertheless, one can still refer to the implicit solution involving the multi-valued implicit function .

==Caveats==
Not every equation implies a graph of a single-valued function, the circle equation being one prominent example. Another example is an implicit function given by where is a cubic polynomial having a &quot;hump&quot; in its graph. Thus, for an implicit function to be a &quot;true&quot; (single-valued) function it might be necessary to use just part of the graph. An implicit function can sometimes be successfully defined as a true function only after &quot;zooming in&quot; on some part of the -axis and &quot;cutting away&quot; some unwanted function branches. Then an equation expressing as an implicit function of the other variables can be written.

The defining equation can also have other pathologies. For example, the equation does not imply a function giving solutions for at all; it is a vertical line. In order to avoid a problem like this, various constraints are frequently imposed on the allowable sorts of equations or on the domain. The implicit function theorem provides a uniform way of handling these sorts of pathologies.

==Implicit differentiation==
In calculus, a method called implicit differentiation makes use of the chain rule to differentiate implicitly defined functions.

To differentiate an implicit function , defined by an equation , it is not generally possible to solve it explicitly for and then differentiate. Instead, one can totally differentiate with respect to and and then solve the resulting linear equation for to explicitly get the derivative in terms of and . Even when it is possible to explicitly solve the original equation, the formula resulting from total differentiation is, in general, much simpler and easier to use.

===Examples===
==== Example 1 ====
Consider

:formula_10

This equation is easy to solve for , giving

:formula_11

where the right side is the explicit form of the function . Differentiation then gives .

Alternatively, one can totally differentiate the original equation:

:formula_12

Solving for gives

:formula_13

the same answer as obtained previously.

==== Example 2 ====
An example of an implicit function for which implicit differentiation is easier than using explicit differentiation is the function defined by the equation

:formula_14

To differentiate this explicitly with respect to , one has first to get

:formula_15

and then differentiate this function. This creates two derivatives: one for and another for .

It is substantially easier to implicitly differentiate the original equation:

:formula_16

giving

:formula_17

==== Example 3 ====
Often, it is difficult or impossible to solve explicitly for , and implicit differentiation is the only feasible method of differentiation. An example is the equation

:formula_18

It is impossible to algebraically express explicitly as a function of , and therefore one cannot find by explicit differentiation. Using the implicit method, can be obtained by differentiating the equation to obtain

:formula_19

where . Factoring out shows that

:formula_20

which yields the result

:formula_21

which is defined for

:formula_22

===General formula for derivative of implicit function===
If , the derivative of the implicit function is given by

:formula_23

where and indicate the partial derivatives of with respect to and .

The above formula comes from using the generalized chain rule to obtain the total derivative — with respect to — of both sides of :

:formula_24

hence

:formula_25

which, when solved for , gives the expression above.

==Implicit function theorem==

Let be a differentiable function of two variables, and be a pair of real numbers such that . If , then defines an implicit function that is differentiable in some small enough neighbourhood of ; in other words, there is a differentiable function that is defined and differentiable in some neighbourhood of , such that for in this neighbourhood.

The condition means that is a regular point of the implicit curve of implicit equation where the tangent is not vertical.

In a less technical language, implicit functions exist and can be differentiated, if the curve has a non-vertical tangent.

==In algebraic geometry==
Consider a relation of the form , where is a multivariable polynomial. The set of the values of the variables that satisfy this relation is called an implicit curve if and an implicit surface if . The implicit equations are the basis of algebraic geometry, whose basic subjects of study are the simultaneous solutions of several implicit equations whose left-hand sides are polynomials. These sets of simultaneous solutions are called affine algebraic sets.

==In differential equations==
The solutions of differential equations generally appear expressed by an implicit function.

==Applications in economics==

===Marginal rate of substitution===

In economics, when the level set is an indifference curve for the quantities and consumed of two goods, the absolute value of the implicit derivative is interpreted as the marginal rate of substitution of the two goods: how much more of one must receive in order to be indifferent to a loss of one unit of .

===Marginal rate of technical substitution===

Similarly, sometimes the level set is an isoquant showing various combinations of utilized quantities of labor and of physical capital each of which would result in the production of the same given quantity of output of some good. In this case the absolute value of the implicit derivative is interpreted as the marginal rate of technical substitution between the two factors of production: how much more capital the firm must use to produce the same amount of output with one less unit of labor.

===Optimization===
Often in economic theory, some function such as a utility function or a profit function is to be maximized with respect to a choice vector even though the objective function has not been restricted to any specific functional form. The implicit function theorem guarantees that the first-order conditions of the optimization define an implicit function for each element of the optimal vector of the choice vector . When profit is being maximized, typically the resulting implicit functions are the labor demand function and the supply functions of various goods. When utility is being maximized, typically the resulting implicit functions are the labor supply function and the demand functions for various goods.

Moreover, the influence of the problem&#x27;s parameters on — the partial derivatives of the implicit function — can be expressed as total derivatives of the system of first-order conditions found using total differentiation.

<text>The Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane, also known as the Battle of Niagara or contemporarily as the Battle of Bridgewater, was fought on 25 July 1814, during the War of 1812, between an invading American army and a British and Canadian army near present-day Niagara Falls, Ontario. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the war, and one of the deadliest battles fought in Canada, with approximately 1,720 casualties including 258 killed.

The engagement was marked by intense musketry at close range and instances of friendly fire on both sides amidst the smoke and confusion, which caused several units to break entirely.
The two armies fought each other to a stalemate; neither side held firm control of the field following the engagement. However, the casualties suffered by the Americans precipitated their withdrawal, and the British held the strategic initiative.

==Background==
On 3 July 1814 an American army under Major General Jacob Brown launched an attack across the Niagara River near its source on Lake Erie. His force quickly captured the British position at Fort Erie and then advanced north. Two days later one of his two brigades of regular U.S. Infantry under Brigadier General Winfield Scott defeated a British force commanded by Major General Phineas Riall at the Battle of Chippawa.

A few days after the battle, Brown outflanked the British defences along the Chippawa Creek and the British fell back to Fort George near the mouth of the Niagara on Lake Ontario. Brown lacked the necessary troops and heavy artillery to attack this position and a British naval squadron controlled the lake. Commodore Isaac Chauncey, commander of the American ships based at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York, was waiting for new frigates and armed brigs to be completed before he challenged the British squadron. The American squadron was further delayed in port when Chauncey fell ill. As a result, no reinforcements or heavy guns were sent to Brown, and the British were able to move several units across the lake from York to reinforce Fort George.

For most of July, Brown&#x27;s army occupied Queenston, a few miles south of Fort George. In this forward position they were harassed by Canadian militia and First Nation warriors. On 24 July Brown fell back to Chippawa Creek, intending to secure his supplies before advancing west to Burlington. As soon as Brown retired, British light infantry and militia under Major General Riall advanced to Lundy&#x27;s Lane north of the Chippawa to allow light troops to maintain contact with the American main force.

==Battle==
===Preliminary movements===
Early on 25 July, the British Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond, arrived in Fort George to take personal command on the Niagara peninsula. He immediately ordered a force under Lieutenant Colonel John Tucker to advance south from Fort Niagara (which the British had captured in December 1813) along the east side of the Niagara River, hoping this would force Brown to evacuate the west bank. Instead, Brown ordered an advance north, intending in turn to force the British to recall Tucker&#x27;s column to protect Fort George. The Americans apparently did not know that the British held Lundy&#x27;s Lane in strength.

As soon as Riall knew the Americans were advancing, he ordered his troops to fall back to Fort George and ordered another column under Colonel Hercules Scott to move from St. Davids to Queenston to cover his withdrawal, rather than advance to his support. These orders were countermanded by Drummond, who had force-marched a detachment of reinforcements to Lundy&#x27;s Lane from Fort George. The British were still reoccupying their positions when the first American units came into view, at about 6:00 pm.

===Scott&#x27;s attack===
Lundy&#x27;s Lane was a spur from the main Portage Road alongside the Niagara River. It ran along the summit of some rising ground (about 25 feet higher than the surrounding area) and therefore commanded good views of the area. The British artillery (two 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns, one 5.5-inch howitzer and a Congreve rocket detachment) were massed in a cemetery at the highest point of the battlefield.

The American 1st Brigade of regulars under Winfield Scott, with Towson&#x27;s artillery company, emerged in the late afternoon from a forest into an open field and was badly mauled by the British artillery. Scott sent the 25th U.S. Infantry, commanded by Major Thomas Jesup, to outflank the British left. The 25th found a disused track leading to a landing stage on the river and used it to pass round the British flank. They caught the British and Canadian units there (the light company of the 1st Battalion of the 8th (King&#x27;s) Regiment and the Upper Canada Incorporated Militia Battalion) while they were redeploying and unaware of the American presence, and drove them back in confusion. The British and Canadians rallied, but had been driven off the Portage Road. Jesup sent Captain Ketchum&#x27;s light infantry company to secure the junction of Lundy&#x27;s Lane and the Portage Road. Ketchum&#x27;s company captured large numbers of wounded and messengers, including Major General Riall, who had been wounded in one arm and was riding to the rear. Most of the prisoners escaped when Ketchum, having briefly rejoined Jesup, ran into an enemy unit while trying to return to the main body of the American army, although Riall and militia cavalry leader Captain William Hamilton Merritt remained prisoners.

Jesup&#x27;s action and the steadiness of Scott&#x27;s brigade persuaded Drummond to withdraw his centre to maintain alignment with his left flank, and also pull back the Glengarry Light Infantry, who had been harassing Scott&#x27;s own left flank. The withdrawal of Drummond&#x27;s center left the artillery exposed in front of the infantry.

===Brown&#x27;s attack===

By nightfall, Scott&#x27;s brigade had suffered heavy casualties. Brown had arrived late in the day with the American main body (the 2nd Brigade of regulars under Brigadier General Eleazer Wheelock Ripley and a brigade of volunteers from the militia under Brigadier General Peter B. Porter). As Ripley and Porter relieved Scott&#x27;s brigade, Brown ordered the 21st U.S. Infantry under Lieutenant Colonel James Miller to capture the British guns. Miller famously responded, &quot;I&#x27;ll try, Sir&quot;.

While the British were distracted by another attack by the 1st U.S. Infantry on their right, Miller&#x27;s troops deployed within a few yards of the British artillery. They fired a volley of musketry that killed most of the gunners and followed up with a bayonet charge; this captured the guns and drove the British centre from the hill. The British infantry immediately behind the guns (the 2nd Battalion of the 89th Foot) tried to counter-attack, but were driven back by Miller and Ripley.

Meanwhile, the British column under Colonel Hercules Scott was arriving on the field, already tired from its unnecessary diversion via Queenston. Unaware of the changed situation, they blundered into Ripley&#x27;s brigade and were also driven back in disorder, losing their own three 6-pounder guns. These were recovered by a charge by the light company of the 41st Foot, but were either abandoned again or remained in British hands but could not be brought into action as the drivers and gunners had been scattered.

===Drummond&#x27;s counter-attack===
While the Americans tried to deploy their own artillery among the captured British guns, Drummond (who had been wounded in the neck) reorganized his troops and mounted a determined attempt to retake his own cannon. There was no subtlety; Drummond launched an attack in line, without attempting to use his many light infantry to harass or disorder the American line, or to locate any weak points in it. The Americans beat back the attack after a short-range musketry duel over the abandoned British guns, in which both sides suffered heavy casualties. The Glengarry Light Infantry, who had once again begun to harass the American left flank, were mistaken for Americans by other British units and forced to withdraw after suffering casualties from British fire.

Undeterred by his first failure, Drummond launched a second attack, using the same methods and formation as in the first. Although some American units wavered, they were rallied by Ripley and stood their ground. While the combat was taking place, Winfield Scott led his depleted brigade (which had been reorganized into a single ad hoc battalion under Major Henry Leavenworth) in an unauthorized attack against Drummond&#x27;s centre. Scott&#x27;s brigade was engaged both by the British and by units of Ripley&#x27;s brigade, who were not aware of the identity of the troops at which they were shooting. Drummond&#x27;s line was driven back but Scott&#x27;s men broke in disorder and retreated, before rallying on the American left. Scott rode to join Jesup&#x27;s regiment, still out on the right flank, but was severely wounded shortly afterwards.

Shortly before midnight, Drummond launched a third counter-attack, using every man he could find, although by this time the British line consisted of mixed-up detachments and companies, rather than organized regiments and battalions. The fighting over the artillery was closer than before, with bayonets being used at one point, but again the exhausted British fell back.

===End of the battle===
By midnight both sides were spent. On the American side only 700 men were still standing in the line. Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown were both severely wounded. Brown would soon recover but Scott&#x27;s injury removed him from the campaign. With supplies and water short, Brown ordered a retreat. Porter and Lieutenant Colonel Jacob Hindman (Brown&#x27;s artillery commander) protested but complied. Ripley apparently did not learn of Brown&#x27;s order until he realised that Hindman&#x27;s artillery had been withdrawn. Although urged by Porter to maintain his position, he also withdrew. The British still had 1,400 men on the field but they were in no condition to interfere with the American withdrawal. Drummond had ordered some units to hold the Portage Road and left some light infantry outposts near the Americans, but had withdrawn the remainder a short distance west along Lundy&#x27;s Lane.

The American artillerymen had suffered severely during the fighting, and Hindman had difficulty finding sufficient draught horses to get all his guns away. One American 6-pounder gun had been lost earlier during the close-range fighting, when its drivers had been hit by musket fire and the horses drawing it had bolted into the British lines. Hindman also had to abandon a howitzer with a broken carriage. The Americans were able to drag away one captured 6-pounder gun that had earlier been pushed to the bottom of the high ground in the centre of the former British position. Hindman later found more horses and sent a team back to recover one of the prized British 24-pounder guns. The team was captured by British parties who were wandering around the battlefield.

==Aftermath==

In the early hours of the morning of 26 July, Brown ordered Ripley to recover the abandoned British guns the next day. Reinforcing his exhausted men with detachments that had been left at Chippawa, Ripley moved out at daybreak with 1,200 soldiers but found that Drummond had reoccupied the battlefield with 2,200 men. Ripley withdrew, unmolested.

The American army fell back to Fort Erie, first deliberately destroying the old British fortifications along Chippawa Creek and burning the bridges behind them. Because they were short of transport, they had to abandon or destroy much equipment and supplies to make room for the wounded on the available wagons. Drummond was later to claim that the Americans had retreated in disorder. After burying some of the British and Canadian dead on the battlefield and burning many American corpses in large funeral pyres, the British withdrew to Queenston until Drummond received reinforcements.

In respect to the effect of the battle on the War, the British won a strategic victory, as the Americans on the Niagara had suffered so many casualties that they were now badly outnumbered, and were forced to retire to Fort Erie. Richard V. Barbuto says, &quot;On 26 July, Brown&#x27;s plan to advance on Burlington Heights was irretrievably shattered... Drummond had secured the forts at the northern end of the Niagara, and he had blunted an American advance. Although there was still a lot of fight in both forces, the balance of combat power on the Niagara Peninsula had swung from the invaders to the defenders&quot;.

==Casualties==
The British official casualty return had 84 killed, 559 wounded, 42 captured, and 193 missing. The Americans captured 19 British officers and 150 other ranks, giving a revised British casualty total of 84 killed, 559 wounded, 169 captured, and 55 missing.

The original American official casualty return, dated 30 July 1814, gave 171 dead, 572 wounded, and 117 missing. A slightly later version gave the same number of killed and wounded but 110 missing. Donald Graves, a Canadian historian employed at the Directorate of History, Department of National Defence Canada, says &quot;British records state that four officers and 75 Americans of other ranks captured at Lundy&#x27;s Lane were imprisoned at Quebec in the autumn of 1814. The remainder of the missing were probably the wounded or dead left on the field after Ripley withdrew&quot;. Three officers of the 22nd U.S. Regiment of Infantry; Lieutenants William Sturgis, John D. Kehr and Robert M. Davidson, who appear on the casualty list as &quot;missing&quot; and &quot;supposed to be killed&quot; were later confirmed as having been killed on 25 July. This gives a revised American loss of 174 killed, 572 wounded, 79 captured, and 28 missing. Graves speculates that the discrepancies in the proportions of killed and wounded men between British and American casualties may be accounted for by the Americans not collating their casualty returns until five days after the battle, when some of those originally listed as missing were confirmed to have been killed, and some severely wounded men had died of their wounds.

==Analysis==
There had been much fighting at close quarters. Veteran British officers, who had fought against French armies in the Peninsular War, were horrified at the carnage they had witnessed at Lundy&#x27;s Lane. Drummond reported, &quot;Of so determined a Character were [the American] attacks directed against our guns that our Artillery Men were bayonetted by the enemy in the Act of loading, and the muzzles of the Enemy&#x27;s Guns were advanced within a few Yards of ours&quot;. The battle confirmed that the American regular forces had developed into a highly professional army. Scott is widely credited for this progress, having modelled and trained his troops using French Revolutionary Army drills and exercises, although not all the American units present at Lundy&#x27;s Lane had benefitted from this training.

Of the British and Canadian regulars at Lundy&#x27;s Lane, the inexperienced 103rd regiment engaged other British troops. Many of the other British regulars had been serving for over two years in Upper Canada, had suffered heavy casualties in earlier actions and were consequently war-weary. Towards the end of the battle, the loss of several colonels and the fact that there were few complete regiments present rather than mixtures of detached companies handicapped their final attacks. The detachments of Lincoln militia with Riall&#x27;s division fired wildly and even shot the cockade off their commander&#x27;s hat. Drummond redistributed their ammunition among the regulars and sent the militia to the rear. By comparison, the Incorporated Upper Canada militia battalion rallied and held the British left flank despite being surprised by Jessop and losing their colonel and reserve ammunition. They suffered 142 casualties, while the Lincoln and York militia had one killed and 19 wounded.

Evidence compiled by Donald Graves argues that General Drummond failed to use skirmish pickets to protect his guns, which were consequently captured by the Americans. Drummond also showed little tactical finesse during his counter-attacks, not using his light infantry to their best advantage and mounting only straightforward frontal attacks. American historian John R. Elting suggests that if Drummond had instead concentrated on the vulnerable American left flank, he might have won a decisive victory. (Drummond had much administrative experience, but had previously seen action only in the abortive Flanders Campaign in 1794 as a comparatively junior officer, and in the Egyptian campaign in 1801 as commander of a battalion.)

==Battlefield and memorials==
The site was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1937.

The site of the battle is now a residential and commercial area of Niagara Falls, Ontario. Part of the battlefield site was preserved next to the Drummond Hill Cemetery on Lundy&#x27;s Lane east of Drummond Road. Other memorials added to the site include:
* Soldier&#x27;s Monument – created by the Canadian Parliament and unveiled by Lundy&#x27;s Lane Historical Society in 1895
* Commemorative Wall – added 2004
* Laura Secord is buried at the Drummond Hill Cemetery

==Legacy==

* James Miller&#x27;s response, &quot;I&#x27;ll try, Sir&quot;, to Brown&#x27;s order to capture the British guns is now the motto of the 5th U.S. Infantry. The 21st were merged into this regiment in 1815 when Congress reduced the United States Army to a smaller peacetime establishment.
* Ten active regular infantry battalions of the United States Army (1–2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1–3 Inf, 2–3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1–5 Inf, 2–5 Inf, 1–6 Inf, 2–6 Inf and 4–6 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of a number of American infantry units (the old 1st, 9th, 19th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 25th Infantry Regiments) that took part in the battle.
* Four Regiments of the British Army, the 1st (Royal Scots), 8th (Kings), 41st and the 89th Regiments of Foot were awarded the &quot;Niagara&quot; Battle Honour for their service during the battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. Their. respective modern successor units are: The Royal Regiment of Scotland, the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment, the Royal Welsh Regiment and the Royal Irish Regiment.
* As the result of a decision taken in 2012, four Ontario-based regiments of the Canadian Army perpetuate the history and heritage of the Battalion of Incorporated Militia and thus carry the NIAGARA battle honour earned by that battalion. These regiments are: The Lincoln and Welland Regiment, the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers, the Brockville Rifles and the Princess of Wales&#x27; Own Regiment.
* Seven other Canadian Army regiments carry the same Battle Honour in commemoration of other Canadian Fencible and Militia units that took part in the battle. They are: the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders, the North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment, the 56th Field Artillery Regiment, RCA, the Essex and Kent Scottish Regiment, the Royal Canadian Regiment, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, and The Lorne Scots.
* In 1818, American poet John Neal published the poem &quot;Battle of Niagara&quot; about the battle. It is considered the best poetic description of Niagara Falls up to that time.
* In 1908, Canadian poet Duncan Campbell Scott wrote a poem, &quot;The Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane,&quot; which won a contest sponsored by the Toronto &quot;Globe&quot;. The poem was reprinted in his 1916 collection, &quot;Lundy&#x27;s Lane and Other Poems.&quot;
* Lundy&#x27;s Lane is mentioned in the unofficial Canadian patriotic anthem, &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; :
:&quot;At Queenston Heights and Lundy&#x27;s Lane our brave fathers, side by side&quot;
:&quot;for freedom, homes, and loved ones dear, firmly stood and nobly died.&quot;
:&quot;And those dear rights which they maintained, we swear to yield them never.&quot;
:&quot;Our watchword evermore shall be, the Maple Leaf forever!&quot;

==Catherine Lundy==
Catherine Lundy was born in the late 1700s to Elizabeth Garvey and Lieutenant Daniel Shannon of the British army. As a teen, she married Thomas Lundy, with whom she would eventually have eight children. They settled at Lundy Lane, just one mile west of Niagara Falls. On July 25, 1814, British soldiers passed her house on their way to meet the Americans. Rather than fleeing with everyone else, she provided them with water after their 14-mile march. Furthermore, as a battle broke out just one mile east of her property, she opened her home to tend to the wounded. The British army was so appreciative of her help that one officer gave her his sword as a thanks. Catherine Lundy died in the middle of the 19th century, going down in history as a &quot;saint&quot;.

<text>A luminous efficiency function or luminosity function represents the average spectral sensitivity of human visual perception of light. It is based on subjective judgements of which of a pair of different-colored lights is brighter, to describe relative sensitivity to light of different wavelengths. It is not an absolute reference to any particular individual, but is a standard observer representation of visual sensitivity of a theoretical human eye. It is valuable as a baseline for experimental purposes, and in colorimetry. Different luminous efficiency functions apply under different lighting conditions, varying from photopic in brightly lit conditions through mesopic to scotopic under low lighting conditions. When not specified, &quot;the luminous efficiency function&quot; generally refers to the photopic luminous efficiency function.

The CIE photopic luminous efficiency function or is a standard function established by the Commission Internationale de l&#x27;Éclairage (CIE) and standardized in collaboration with the ISO, and may be used to convert radiant energy into luminous (i.e., visible) energy. It also forms the central color matching function in the CIE 1931 color space.

==Details==

There are two luminous efficiency functions in common use. For everyday light levels, the photopic luminosity function best approximates the response of the human eye. For low light levels, the response of the human eye changes, and the scotopic curve applies. The photopic curve is the CIE standard curve used in the CIE 1931 color space.

The luminous flux (or visible power) in a light source is defined by the photopic luminosity function. The following equation calculates the total luminous flux in a source of light:
: formula_1
where
* Φv is the luminous flux, in lumens;
* Φe,λ is the spectral radiant flux, in watts per nanometre;
* (&quot;λ&quot;), also known as &quot;V&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;), is the luminosity function, dimensionless;
* &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength, in nanometres.

Formally, the integral is the inner product of the luminosity function with the spectral power distribution. In practice, the integral is replaced by a sum over discrete wavelengths for which tabulated values of the luminous efficiency function are available. The CIE distributes standard tables with luminosity function values at intervals from to .

The standard luminous efficiency function is normalized to a peak value of unity at (see luminous coefficient). The value of the constant in front of the integral is usually rounded off to . The small excess fractional value comes from the slight mismatch between the definition of the lumen and the peak of the luminosity function. The lumen is defined to be unity for a radiant energy of at a frequency of , which corresponds to a standard air wavelength of rather than , which is the peak of the luminosity curve. The value of (&quot;λ&quot;) is at , so that a value of 683/ = 683.002 is the multiplicative constant.

The number 683 is connected to the modern (1979) definition of the candela, the unit of luminous intensity. This arbitrary number made the new definition give numbers equivalent to those from the old definition of the candela.

==Improvements to the standard==
The CIE 1924 photopic &quot;V&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) luminosity function, which is included in the CIE 1931 color-matching functions as the (&quot;λ&quot;) function, has long been acknowledged to underestimate the contribution of the blue end of the spectrum to perceived luminance. There have been numerous attempts to improve the standard function, to make it more representative of human vision. Judd in 1951, improved by Vos in 1978, resulted in a function known as CIE &quot;V&quot;M(&quot;λ&quot;). More recently, Sharpe, Stockman, Jagla &amp; Jägle (2005) developed a function consistent with the Stockman &amp; Sharpe cone fundamentals; their curves are plotted in the figure above.

Stockman &amp; Sharpe has subsequently produced an improved function in 2011, taking into account the effects of chromatic adaptation &quot;under daylight&quot;. Their work in 2008 has revealed that &quot;luminous efficiency or V(l) functions change dramatically with chromatic adaptation&quot;.

===ISO standard===
The ISO standard is ISO/CIE FDIS 11664-1. The standard provides an incremental table by nm of each value in the visible range for the CIE 1924 function.

==Scotopic luminosity==
For very low levels of intensity (scotopic vision), the sensitivity of the eye is mediated by rods, not cones, and shifts toward the violet, peaking around for young eyes; the sensitivity is equivalent to or at this peak. The standard scotopic luminous efficiency function or &quot;V&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) was adopted by the CIE in 1951, based on measurements by Wald (1945) and by Crawford (1949).

Luminosity for mesopic vision, a wide transitioning band between scotopic and phototic vision, is more poorly standardized. The consensus is that this luminous efficiency can be written as a weighted average of scotopic and mesopic luminosities, but different organizations provide different weighting factors.

== Color blindness ==

Color blindness changes the sensitivity of the eye as a function of wavelength. For people with protanopia, the peak of the eye&#x27;s response is shifted toward the short-wave part of the spectrum (approximately 540 nm), while for people with deuteranopia, there is a slight shift in the peak of the spectrum, to about 560 nm. People with protanopia have essentially no sensitivity to light of wavelengths more than 670 nm.

Most non-primate mammals have the same luminous efficiency function as people with protanopia. Their insensitivity to long-wavelength red light makes it possible to use such illumination while studying the nocturnal life of animals.

For older people with normal color vision, the crystalline lens may become slightly yellow due to cataracts, which moves the maximum of sensitivity to the red part of the spectrum and narrows the range of perceived wavelengths.

<doc id="250906" wikidata="Q787179" url="?curid=250906" title="Automatic number identification">
<text>Automatic number identification (ANI) is a feature of a telecommunications network for automatically determining the origination telephone number on toll calls for billing purposes. Automatic number identification was originally created by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) for long distance service in the Bell System, eliminating the need for telephone operators to manually record calls.

Modern ANI has two components: information digits, which identify the class of service, and the calling party billing telephone number.

The term is also used to describe the functions of two-way radio selective calling that identify the transmitting user.

ANI is distinct from newer caller ID services, such as call display, which are solely for informing a subscriber.

==Toll-free telephone numbers==
Modern toll-free telephone numbers, which generate itemized billing of all calls received instead of relying on the special fixed-rate trunks of the Bell System&#x27;s original Inward WATS service, depend on ANI to track inbound calls to numbers in special area codes such as +1-800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844, and 833 with 822 reserved for future toll free use (United States and Canada), 1800 (Australia) or 0800 and 0808 (United Kingdom).

==Privacy==
ANI is conceptually and technically different from caller ID service. A caller&#x27;s telephone number and line type are captured by ANI service even if caller ID blocking is activated. The destination telephone company switching office can relay the originating telephone number to ANI delivery services subscribers. Toll-free subscribers and large companies normally have access to ANI, either instantly via installed equipment, or from a monthly billing statement. Residential subscribers can obtain access to ANI information through third party companies that charge for the service.

ANI is generally not transmitted when a call is operator assisted; only the area code of the last switch to route the call is sent.

==Automatic number announcement==
ANI is used to provide automatic number announcement, a test facility of a central office for telephone installation technicians. The service, which is not advertised to the public, allows an installer to identify a line by dialing a telephone number. Such numbers are typically assigned in a a range reserved for testing purposes (such as 958-xxxx in much of North America).

==DNIS==
Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) is a related service feature available to private branch exchange subscribers. It transmits information about the destination number, which a service provider can use to have several toll-free numbers directed to the same call center and provide unique service. DNIS can also be used to identify other call routing information. For example, toll-free service can be configured to send a specific DNIS number that is assigned to callers from geographic regions based on city, area code, state, or country.

<doc id="250908" wikidata="Q736896" url="?curid=250908" title="Lemniscate of Bernoulli">
<text>In geometry, the lemniscate of Bernoulli is a plane curve defined from two given points and , known as foci, at distance from each other as the locus of points so that . The curve has a shape similar to the numeral 8 and to the ∞ symbol. Its name is from , which is Latin for &quot;decorated with hanging ribbons&quot;. It is a special case of the Cassini oval and is a rational algebraic curve of degree 4.

This lemniscate was first described in 1694 by Jakob Bernoulli as a modification of an ellipse, which is the locus of points for which the sum of the distances to each of two fixed &quot;focal points&quot; is a constant. A Cassini oval, by contrast, is the locus of points for which the &quot;product&quot; of these distances is constant. In the case where the curve passes through the point midway between the foci, the oval is a lemniscate of Bernoulli.

This curve can be obtained as the inverse transform of a hyperbola, with the inversion circle centered at the center of the hyperbola (bisector of its two foci). It may also be drawn by a mechanical linkage in the form of Watt&#x27;s linkage, with the lengths of the three bars of the linkage and the distance between its endpoints chosen to form a crossed parallelogram.

== Equations ==

==Arc length and elliptic functions==
The determination of the arc length of arcs of the lemniscate leads to elliptic integrals, as was discovered in the eighteenth century. Around 1800, the elliptic functions inverting those integrals were studied by C. F. Gauss (largely unpublished at the time, but allusions in the notes to his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;). The period lattices are of a very special form, being proportional to the Gaussian integers. For this reason the case of elliptic functions with complex multiplication by  is called the &quot;lemniscatic case&quot; in some sources.

Using the elliptic integral
:formula_8
the formula of the arc length can be given as
:formula_9
where formula_10 and formula_11 are defined as above, formula_12 is the lemniscate constant, formula_13 is the gamma function and formula_14 is the arithmetic–geometric mean.

==Angles==
Given two distinct points formula_15 and formula_16, let formula_17 be the midpoint of formula_18. Then the lemniscate of diameter formula_18 can also be defined as the set of points formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, together with the locus of the points formula_23 such that formula_24 is a right angle (cf. Thales&#x27; theorem and its converse).
The following theorem about angles occurring in the lemniscate is due to German mathematician Gerhard Christoph Hermann Vechtmann, who described it 1843 in his dissertation on lemniscates. 

: and are the foci of the lemniscate, is the midpoint of the line segment and is any point on the lemniscate outside the line connecting and . The normal of the lemniscate in intersects the line connecting and in . Now the interior angle of the triangle at is one third of the triangle&#x27;s exterior angle at (see also angle trisection). In addition the interior angle at is twice the interior angle at .

==Further properties==

*The lemniscate is symmetric to the line connecting its foci and and as well to the perpendicular bisector of the line segment .
*The lemniscate is symmetric to the midpoint of the line segment .
*The area enclosed by the lemniscate is .
*The lemniscate is the circle inversion of a hyperbola and vice versa.
*The two tangents at the midpoint are perpendicular, and each of them forms an angle of with the line connecting and .
*The planar cross-section of a standard torus tangent to its inner equator is a lemniscate.
*The curvature at formula_25 is formula_26. The maximum curvature, which occurs at formula_27, is therefore formula_28.

==Applications==
Dynamics on this curve and its more generalized versions are studied in quasi-one-dimensional models.

<doc id="250910" wikidata="Q672107" url="?curid=250910" title="Ouija">
<text>The Ouija ( , ), also known as a Ouija board, spirit board, talking board, or witch board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the Latin alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, and occasionally &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;, along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a planchette (a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic) as a movable indicator to spell out messages during a séance. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. The name &quot;Ouija&quot; is a trademark of Hasbro (inherited from Parker Brothers), but is often used generically to refer to any talking board.

Spiritualists in the United States believed that the dead were able to contact the living, and reportedly used a talking board very similar to the modern Ouija board at their camps in Ohio during 1886 with the intent of enabling faster communication with spirits. Following its commercial patent by businessman Elijah Bond being passed on 10 February 1891, the Ouija board was regarded as an innocent parlor game unrelated to the occult until American spiritualist Pearl Curran popularized its use as a divining tool during World War I.

Paranormal and supernatural beliefs associated with Ouija have been criticized by the scientific community and are characterized as pseudoscience. The action of the board can be most easily explained by unconscious movements of those controlling the pointer, a psychophysiological phenomenon known as the ideomotor effect.

Mainstream Christian denominations, including Catholicism, have warned against the use of Ouija boards, considering their use in Satanic practices, while other religious groups hold that they can lead to demonic possession. Occultists, on the other hand, are divided on the issue, with some claiming it can be a tool for positive transformation, while others reiterate the warnings of many Christians and caution &quot;inexperienced users&quot; against it.

==Etymology==
The popular belief that the word &quot;&quot; comes from the French (&quot;oui&quot;) and German (&quot;ja&quot;) words for &quot;yes&quot; is a misconception. In fact, the name was given from a word spelled out on the board when medium Helen Peters Nosworthy asked the board to name itself. When asked what the word meant, it responded &quot;Good Luck&quot;.

==History==
===Precursors===

One of the first mentions of the automatic writing method used in the Ouija board is found in China around 1100 AD, in historical documents of the Song dynasty. The method was known as &quot;fuji&quot; &quot;planchette writing&quot;. The use of planchette writing as an ostensible means of necromancy and communion with the spirit-world continued, and, albeit under special rituals and supervisions, was a central practice of the Quanzhen School, until it was forbidden by the Qing dynasty.

===Talking boards===
As a part of the spiritualist movement, mediums began to employ various means for communication with the dead. Following the American Civil War in the United States, mediums did significant business in allegedly allowing survivors to contact lost relatives. Use of talking boards was so common by 1886 that news reported the phenomenon taking over the spiritualists&#x27; camps in Ohio. The Ouija was named in 1890 in Baltimore, Maryland by medium and spiritualist Helen Peters Nosworthy.

===Commercial parlor game===
Charles Kennard, the founder of Kennard Novelty Company, claims to have invented the board with his business partner, Elijah Bond, who patented it with help from his sister-in-law, spiritualist and medium Helen Peters Nosworthy. The local patent office at first refused a patent. Bond and Nosworthy then traveled to Washington, D.C. where they were also denied a patent until the chief patent officer asked the board to spell out his name, which it did.
In 1901, an employee of Bond, William Fuld, took over the talking board production under the name &quot;Ouija&quot;.

==Scientific investigation==
The Ouija phenomenon is considered by the scientific community to be the result of the ideomotor response. Michael Faraday first described this effect in 1853, while investigating table-turning.

Various studies have been conducted, recreating the effects of the Ouija board in the lab and showing that, under laboratory conditions, the subjects were moving the planchette involuntarily. A 2012 study found that when answering yes or no questions, Ouija use was significantly more accurate than guesswork, suggesting that it might draw on the unconscious mind. Skeptics have described Ouija board users as &quot;operators&quot;. Some critics have noted that the messages ostensibly spelled out by spirits were similar to whatever was going through the minds of the subjects. According to professor of neurology Terence Hines in his book &quot;Pseudoscience and the Paranormal&quot; (2003):

The planchette is guided by unconscious muscular exertions like those responsible for table movement. Nonetheless, in both cases, the illusion that the object (table or planchette) is moving under its own control is often extremely powerful and sufficient to convince many people that spirits are truly at work ... The unconscious muscle movements responsible for the moving tables and Ouija board phenomena seen at seances are examples of a class of phenomena due to what psychologists call a dissociative state. A dissociative state is one in which consciousness is somehow divided or cut off from some aspects of the individual&#x27;s normal cognitive, motor, or sensory functions.

Some involuntary movements are known as &quot;Automatism&quot;.

This correlates with the ideomotor phenomenon because both rely on unconscious movement. The difference is that the ideomotor phenomenon is based on the idea that just the idea that something can happen tricks the brain into doing it. For example, thinking about not moving the planchette leads to the possibility of the planchette moving, which then makes someone unconsciously move the planchette.

Ouija boards were already criticized by scholars early on, being described in a 1927 journal as vestigial remains&#x27; of primitive belief-systems&quot; and a con to part fools from their money. Another 1921 journal described reports of Ouija board findings as &#x27;half truths&#x27; and suggested that their inclusion in national newspapers at the time lowered the national discourse overall.

==Religious responses==

Since early in the Ouija board&#x27;s history, it has been criticized by several Christian denominations. The Catholic Church in the Catechism of the Catholic Church explicitly forbids any practice of divination, which includes the usage of Ouija boards. &quot;Catholic Answers&quot;, a Roman Catholic Christian apologetics organization, claims that &quot;The Ouija board is far from harmless, as it is a form of divination (seeking information from supernatural sources).&quot;

In 2005, Catholic bishops in the Chuuk State of the Federated States of Micronesia called for the boards to be banned and warned congregations that they were talking to demons when using Ouija boards. In a 1995 pastoral letter, The Dutch Reformed Churches encouraged its communicants to avoid Ouija boards, as it is a practice &quot;related to the occult&quot;. The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod forbids its faithful from using Ouija boards as a violation of the Ten Commandments.

In 2001, Ouija boards were burned in Alamogordo, New Mexico, by fundamentalist groups as &quot;symbols of witchcraft&quot;. Religious criticism has expressed beliefs that the Ouija board reveals information which should only be in God&#x27;s hands, and thus it is a tool of Satan. A spokesperson for Human Life International described the boards as a portal to talk to spirits and called for Hasbro to be prohibited from marketing them.

These religious objections to use of the Ouija board have given rise to ostension type folklore in the communities where they circulate. Cautionary tales that the board opens a door to evil spirits turn the game into the subject of a supernatural dare, especially for young people.

==Notable users==
===Literature===
Ouija boards have been the source of inspiration for literary works, used as guidance in writing or as a form of channeling literary works. As a result of Ouija boards&#x27; becoming popular in the early 20th century, by the 1920s many &quot;psychic&quot; books were written of varying quality often initiated by Ouija board use.

* Emily Grant Hutchings claimed that her novel &quot;Jap Herron: A Novel Written from the Ouija Board&quot; (1917) was dictated by Mark Twain&#x27;s spirit through the use of a Ouija board after his death
* Pearl Lenore Curran (1883–1937), alleged that for over 20 years she was in contact with a spirit named Patience Worth. This symbiotic relationship produced several novels, and works of poetry and prose, which Pearl Curran claimed were delivered to her through channelling Worth&#x27;s spirit during sessions with a Ouija board, and which works Curran then transcribed
* Much of William Butler Yeats&#x27;s later poetry was inspired, among other facets of occultism, by the Ouija board
* In late 1963, Jane Roberts and her husband Robert Butts started experimenting with a Ouija board as part of Roberts&#x27; research for a book on extra-sensory perception. According to Roberts and Butts, on 2 December 1963, they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality (an &quot;energy personality essence no longer focused in the physical world&quot;) who eventually identified himself as &quot;Seth&quot;, culminating in a series of books dictated by &quot;Seth&quot;
* In 1982, poet James Merrill released an apocalyptic 560-page epic poem titled &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot;, which documented two decades of messages dictated from the Ouija board during séances hosted by Merrill and his partner David Noyes Jackson. &quot;Sandover&quot;, which received the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1983, was published in three volumes beginning in 1976. The first contained a poem for each of the letters A through Z, and was called &quot;The Book of Ephraim&quot;. It appeared in the collection &quot;Divine Comedies&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1977. According to Merrill, the spirits ordered him to write and publish the next two installments, &quot;&quot; in 1978 (which won the National Book Award for Poetry) and &quot;Scripts for the Pageant&quot; in 1980.

===Aleister Crowley===
Aleister Crowley had great admiration for the use of the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her greatest spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones:

Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate.

Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated 21 February 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones,

Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week.

In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him, &quot;I&#x27;ll think up another name for Ouija&quot;. But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley&#x27;s new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board, that

There is, however, a good way of using this instrument to get what you want, and that is to perform the whole operation in a consecrated circle, so that undesirable aliens cannot interfere with it. You should then employ the proper magical invocation in order to get into your circle just the one spirit you want. It is comparatively easy to do this. A few simple instructions are all that is necessary, and I shall be pleased to give these, free of charge, to any one who cares to apply.

* Former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi claimed under oath that, in a séance held in 1978 with other professors at the University of Bologna, the &quot;ghost&quot; of Giorgio La Pira used a Ouija to spell the name of the street where Aldo Moro was being held by the Red Brigades
** According to Peter Popham of &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;Everybody here has long believed that Prodi&#x27;s Ouija board tale was no more than an ill-advised and bizarre way to conceal the identity of his true source, probably a person from Bologna&#x27;s seething far-left underground whom he was pledged to protect.&quot;
* The Mars Volta wrote their album &quot;Bedlam in Goliath&quot; (2008) based on their alleged experiences with a Ouija board
** According to their story (written for them by a fiction author, Jeremy Robert Johnson), Omar Rodriguez Lopez purchased one while traveling in Jerusalem. At first the board provided a story which became the theme for the album. Strange events allegedly related to this activity occurred during the recording of the album: the studio flooded, one of the album&#x27;s main engineers had a nervous breakdown, equipment began to malfunction, and Cedric Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s foot was injured. Following these bad experiences the band buried the Ouija board

* In London in 1994, convicted murderer Stephen Young was granted a retrial after it was learned that four of the jurors had conducted a Ouija board séance and had &quot;contacted&quot; the murdered man, who had named Young as his killer. Young was convicted for a second time at his retrial and jailed for life
* E. H. Jones and C. W. Hill, whilst prisoners of the Turks during the First World War, used a Ouija board to convince their captors that they were mediums as part of an escape plan

== In popular culture ==
Ouija boards have figured prominently in horror tales in various media as devices enabling malevolent spirits to spook their users.

In the 1919 American comedy film &quot;When the Clouds Roll By&quot;, &quot;Douglas Fairbanks&quot; asks his board: &quot;Ouija - can two live as cheaply as one?&quot;

In the 1960 supernatural horror film &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; the Zorba family plays the game &quot;Ouija, the mystifying oracle&quot;.

Episodes of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (&quot;Ghost in Space&quot; (1966)) and &quot;The Waltons&quot; (&quot;The Ghost Story&quot; (1974)) have spirit boards as part of their plots.

A Ouija board is an early part of the plot of the 1973 horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Using a Ouija board the young girl Regan makes what first appears to be harmless contact with an entity named &quot;Captain Howdy&quot;. She later becomes possessed by a demon.

Based on Ouija Board, a song and album of the name, Ojah Awake, by Osibisa, was released in 1976.

The 1986 film &quot;Witchboard&quot; and its sequels center on the use of Ouija. The 1991 film &quot;And You Thought Your Parents Were Weird&quot; features use of a Ouija board in an important early scene. &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (2000) includes a séance scene with a board. &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; (2007) involves a violent entity haunting a couple that becomes more powerful when the Ouija board is used.

Aparichithan (The Stranger) is a 2004 Indian Malayalam-language horror film. The plot centers around a Ouija board and spiritualism.

Another 2007 film, &quot;Ouija&quot;, depicted a group of adolescents whose use of the board causes a murderous spirit to follow them. In 2011, &quot;The Ouija Experiment&quot; portrayed a group of friends whose use of the board opens, and fails to close, a portal between the worlds of the living and the dead. The 2012 film &quot;I Am Zozo&quot; follows a group of people that run afoul of a demon, based on Pazuzu, after using a Ouija board. The 2014 film &quot;Ouija&quot; features a group of friends whose use of the board prompts a series of deaths. A 2016 prequel, &quot;&quot;, also features the device.

Romancham (Goosebumps) is a 2023 Malayalam-language horror-comedy film. The plot involves several bachelors from Bangalore who improvise a Ouija board from a Carrom game.

The British singer Morrissey released a controversial single titled &quot;Ouija Board, Ouija Board&quot; in 1989. The lyrics and the video of the song mockingly play with the idea of supernaturally contacting dead persons.

The rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony referenced Ouija on their Horrorcore albums &quot;Creepin on ah Come Up&quot; and &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;, having been inspired by seeing the board at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.

Jeremy Gans&#x27; nonfiction book, &quot;The Ouija Board Jurors: Mystery, Mischief and Misery in the Jury System&quot;, based on an article he wrote for the University of Melbourne, recounts an incident in which four jurors sought the help of a Ouija board during a double murder trial, both for guidance and to relieve the stress precipitated by the brutal images of evidence.

The National Geographic show &quot;Brain Games&quot; Season 5 episode &quot;Paranormal&quot; clearly showed the board did not work when all participants were blindfolded.

The sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; in Series 8 Episode 6, includes a scene with a Ouija board where Harold briefly fools Albert into believing that they are in contact with the ghost of Adolf Hitler.

Ouija boards appear in the video game &quot;Phasmophobia&quot; as an item investigators can use to communicate with the ghost, although using it can prove dangerous.

Ouija Board ( ওইজা বোর্ড ) is a Bangladeshi television drama directed by Humayun Ahmed and starring Bipasha Hayat, Shila Ahmed, Al Monsoor, Dilara Zaman, Abul Hayat and others.

<text>Parker Brothers (known by Parker outside of North America) was an American toy and game manufacturer which in 1991 became a brand of Hasbro. More than 1,800 games were published under the Parker Brothers name since 1883. It remained family owned until bought in 1968, and branched into nerf toys and media. Among its products were &quot;Monopoly&quot;, &quot;Clue&quot; (licensed from the British publisher and known as &quot;Cluedo&quot; outside of North America), &quot;Sorry!&quot;, &quot;Risk&quot;, &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Ouija&quot;, &quot;Aggravation&quot;, &quot;Bop It&quot;, &quot;Scrabble&quot; (under a joint partnership with Milton Bradley in the United States and Canada), and &quot;Probe&quot;. In the 21st century, the trade name ceased use, with former products being marketed under the &quot;Hasbro Gaming&quot; label, with the logo shown on &quot;Monopoly&quot; games.

== History ==

Parker Brothers was founded by George Swinnerton Parker. Parker&#x27;s philosophy deviated from the prevalent theme of board game design; he believed that games should be played for enjoyment and did not need to emphasize morals and values. He created his first game, called &quot;Banking&quot;, in 1883 when he was 16. &quot;Banking&quot; is a game in which players borrow money from the bank and try to generate wealth by guessing how well they could do. The game includes 160 cards which foretell their failure or success. The game was so popular among family and friends that his brother, Charles Parker, urged him to publish it. George approached two Boston publishers with the idea, but was unsuccessful. Not discouraged, he spent $40 to publish 500 sets of &quot;Banking&quot;. He eventually sold all but twelve copies, making a profit of $100.

Parker founded his game company, initially called the George S. Parker Company, in his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts in 1883. When George&#x27;s brother Charles joined the business in 1888, the company&#x27;s name was changed to its more familiar form. In 1898 a third brother, Edward H. Parker, joined the company. For many years, George designed most of the games himself, and wrote all the rules. Many games were based on important events of the day: &quot;Klondike&quot; was based on the Klondike Gold Rush, and &quot;War in Cuba&quot; was based on the impending Spanish–American War.

The game industry was growing, and the company was becoming very profitable. In 1906, Parker Brothers published the game &quot;Rook&quot; and it became the bestselling game in the country. During the Great Depression, a time when many companies went out of business, Parker Brothers released a new board game called &quot;Monopoly&quot;. Although the company had originally rejected the game in 1934, they decided to publish it the next year. It was a success, and the company had difficulty keeping up with demand. The company continued to grow throughout the next several decades, producing games including &quot;Cluedo&quot; (released as &quot;Clue&quot; in North America), &quot;Risk&quot;, and &quot;Sorry!&quot;

Parker Brothers marketed its first jigsaw puzzle in 1887. Parker also produced children&#x27;s puzzles, as well as the Climax, Jig-A-Jig, Jig Wood, and Paramount lines. According to &quot;Jigsaw Puzzles: An Illustrated History and Price Guide&quot;, by Anne D. Williams, Parker Bros. closed the Pastime line in the 1950s and their die-cut puzzles were phased out in the late 1970s.

Even after George Parker&#x27;s death, the company remained family-owned until 1968 when General Mills purchased the company. After this, Parker Brothers produced the first &quot;Nerf&quot; ball. In the UK during the 1970s, Parker Brothers sold the rights of some games to the games division of Palitoy (also a General Mills company), and produced a variety of releases such as &quot;Escape from Colditz&quot;. In 1977, the company built its headquarters in Beverly, Massachusetts.

In early 1983, Parker Brothers spent US$15 million establishing a book publishing branch; their first titles featured the American Greetings franchises, Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake. The branch published twelve titles by February 1984; sales of these books totaled 3.5 million units. Parker Brothers also operated a record label around the same time; one of its releases, based on Coleco&#x27;s Cabbage Patch Kids and involving Tom and Stephen Chapin titled &quot;Cabbage Patch Dreams&quot;, was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 1984.

In 1985, General Mills merged the company with their subsidiary Kenner; this new company, Kenner Parker Toys Inc., was acquired by Tonka in 1987. In 1988, Parker Brothers struck a deal with Martindale/Gilden Productions to develop television game shows, such as &quot;Boggle&quot;.

Tonka, including Parker Brothers, was bought in 1991 for about $516 million by Hasbro which also owned the Milton Bradley Company. Following the acquisition, Parker Brothers continued to have its corporate offices in Beverly, but production of the games were moved to Milton Bradley&#x27;s headquarters in East Longmeadow. In 1998, Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley were consolidated at the new Hasbro Games campus (based in the former address of Parker Brothers&#x27; headquarters) to merge together and form Hasbro Games. Milton Bradley and Parker Bros. subsequently turned into two separate brands of Hasbro before being retired in 2009 in favor of the Hasbro brand.

===Video games===
Parker Brothers had a reputation for quality family-oriented and licensed games. The company released &quot;Merlin&quot; in 1978, and sold 700,000 units before Christmas and had a sales total of $100 million in 1979.

It began to produce electronic versions of popular Parker Brothers board games in the late 1970s. The company ventured into the toy market with the electronic action figure, Rom the Spaceknight, in 1979. Although the toy proved a failure, the licensed comic book published by Marvel Comics ran for years after the toy was discontinued.

Parker Brothers spent $50,000 to reverse-engineer Atari&#x27;s hardware to produce its own cartridges. The company was able to obtain the license for Star Wars games as Kenner Products was also owned by General Mills. Parker Brothers earned $74 million from cartridge sales between June and December 1982. Other Parker Brothers video games included many popular arcade games such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Frogger&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot;, and Gottlieb games such as &quot;Q*bert&quot; and &quot;Reactor&quot;.

<doc id="250917" wikidata="Q1031385" url="?curid=250917" title="Marine Corps Air Station El Toro">
<text>Marine Corps Air Station El Toro was a United States Marine Corps Air Station located next to the community of El Toro and was then adjacent to the city of Irvine.

Before it was decommissioned in 1999, it was the home of Marine Corps Aviation on the West Coast. Designated as a Master Jet Base, its four runways (two of and two of ) could handle the largest aircraft in the U.S. military inventory. While it was active, all U.S. Presidents in the post-World War II era landed in &quot;Air Force One&quot; at this airfield. The El Toro &quot;Flying Bull&quot; patch was designed by Walt Disney Studios in 1944. It survived virtually unchanged until the close of the Air Station.

Following its decommissioning the site was used as a filming location, including the test track for the United States version of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; franchise. About of land originally taken by the air station was converted into a large recreational center, the Orange County Great Park, while the rest was re-zoned for residential and commercial development.

==History==

In May 1942, Lieutenant Colonel William Fox was directed to select the sites for all of the Marine Corps&#x27; West Coast air stations. Fox sought the most expeditious and low cost option and thus chose the already existing airports of El Centro, Mojave and Santa Barbara. For the fourth station, he chose land that had previously been looked at by the U.S. Navy for a blimp base. The Marine Corps gave the owner of the land, a farmer named James Irvine Sr., $100,000 for including designated for a blimp base. Construction of MCAS El Toro began on 3 August 1942 on land previously owned by the Irvine Company. The company greatly resisted the station&#x27;s construction at this site, which at the time contained the largest lima bean field in North America, which was the company&#x27;s prime source of revenue. The name &quot;El Toro&quot; came from the nearby small community of El Toro, now incorporated as Lake Forest, which in 1940 only had a population of 130 people.

The base headquarters was established on 4 November 1942, and the first landing occurred in late November when Major Michael Carmichael, flying from Camp Kearny, was forced to make an emergency landing among the construction equipment. The runways and taxiways were completed by 1 December 1942, and all squadron hangars were complete by 15 January 1943. Barracks and officer&#x27;s quarters were ready by 20 January. January 1943 also saw the first operational units arriving at MCAS El Toro. First aboard were Marine Aircraft Group 41 and VMF-113. They were followed later in the month by VMSB-142, VMF-224, VMSB-231 and VMSB-232, who were returning from fighting during the Battle of Guadalcanal in order to re-organize, re-equip and train. The station was formally commissioned on 17 March 1943, with Colonel Theodore B. Millard as the first commanding officer. Soon after its opening, MCAS El Toro was handling the largest tactical aerodrome traffic on the Pacific Coast.

Already the largest Marine Corps air station on the West Coast, in 1944, funds were approved to double its size and operations. By the end of 1944, the base was home to 1,248 officers and 6,831 enlisted personnel.

In 1950, El Toro was selected as a permanent Master Jet Base for the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific.
To support this new role, the aviation infrastructure at El Toro was expanded significantly. For most of the ensuing years, El Toro served as the primary base for Marine Corps west coast fighter squadrons. During the 1960s, many US Marines left for and returned from the Vietnam War at El Toro MCAS. In 1958, Marine Corps Air Station Miami was closed which brought the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing to El Toro.

During the presidency of Richard Nixon, MCAS El Toro was used for flights to and from his &quot;Western White House&quot; at San Clemente, California. On 9 August 1974, after resigning the Presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Richard and Pat Nixon flew from Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland to El Toro aboard VC-137C SAM 27000.

The land originally surrounding the base was mostly used for agricultural purposes when it first opened, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, residential development began in the area; most of it was directly in the path of the base&#x27;s runways, which proved to be a major problem as the constant loud noise produced by jets and helicopters passing overhead was very irritating to those living in the area. Few desired to move there because of this, causing the new neighborhoods to struggle.

In 1993, MCAS El Toro was designated for closing by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission and all of its activities were to be transferred to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. The station officially closed on 2 July 1999.

==Environmental remediation==

Before the site could be developed for civilian use, the Department of the Navy (which oversees both the Navy and the Marine Corps) was required to perform environmental remediation to clean up contaminated soil on the site. The contamination was caused by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), primarily industrial solvents that had been used over the years for purposes such as degreasing, paint stripping, and the cleaning of aircraft.

Over the years, the VOCs had seeped into the groundwater, resulting in a plume of contaminated groundwater extending for three miles (5 km) to the west of the station. In July 2005, the Department of the Navy&#x27;s Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Program Management Office (PMO) issued a public notice stating that the cleanup of the contaminated soil was complete.
The cleanup of the groundwater is being handled by the Irvine Desalter Project, a project of two local water authorities that has financial backing from the Navy and the State of California.

==Conversion proposals==
The closing of MCAS El Toro ignited a political firestorm over the eventual fate of the facility. With the existing infrastructure, some favored converting the base into an international airport. Those favoring the new airport tended to come from northern Orange County (desiring the convenience of a closer airport), and from areas in Newport Beach that are within the arrival and departure noise zones surrounding John Wayne Airport (hoping to close that airport in favor of the new one at El Toro).

Those against the airport proposal were largely residents of the cities in the immediate vicinity of El Toro, such as Irvine, Lake Forest, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Woods, Dana Point, and Mission Viejo, where residents were alarmed at the idea of the aircraft noise. The cities opposed to the airport created a joint powers authority, the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority (ETRPA), to oppose the project. They were joined in the effort by grassroots organizations that collected record numbers of signatures on petitions to place anti-airport initiatives on the ballot and raised funds for the election campaigns. This faction lobbied strongly in favor of other uses for the property. The city of Irvine sought to annex the property for park and related uses.

In November 1994, voters passed Measure A, designating the property&#x27;s land use to commercial aviation in the Orange County General Plan. A March 1996 ballot measure attempted to overturn Measure A, but failed. Since that time, the county released reports recommending conversion of El Toro into a commercial airport.

The battle between pro-airport and anti-airport groups dominated Orange County politics for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s. From 1994 to 2001, $80 million in county and city funds was spent on campaigning for both sides. Airport proposals were defeated in two hotly contested ballot initiatives, and further challenges took place in the courts. A series of demonstration commercial flights from the airport in June 1999 generated less noise than the former military flights, but resulted in much public outcry due to the use of different flight paths from the military, and incessant circling over nearby cities to line up for another approach. Eventually the airport opponents prevailed, and in March 2002, the Department of Defense announced that it would sell the land to private interests to be developed into Orange County Great Park.

While many county residents were not persuaded of the need for a larger airport, regional transportation planners insisted that the county must share in handling a greater portion of the millions of passengers traveling by air in Southern California.

==Sale==
The Department of the Navy hired the General Services Administration and Los Angeles-based Colliers International to assist in the sale of MCAS El Toro. Colliers branded the project as Heritage Fields combining the long-standing history of the base and what the future of the base will be to the community and the generations to come. An online auction was conducted and in February 2005, the final bid of $650 million was accepted for the four parcels of land comprising the former MCAS El Toro. The auction winner was Heritage Fields LLC, a joint venture between Lennar and several other firms. Development plans for the site include residential, golf, commercial, R&amp;D, and schools. of the site will be dedicated to the Great Park. A ceremony to formally transfer ownership of the property to Heritage Fields LLC was held on 29 August 2005.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 19 November 1958, an F4D Skyray fighter jet overshot the runway and was struck by a southbound passenger train, the San Diegan. Train No. 74 hit the F4D at 75 miles (121 km)-per-hour. All three locomotive units and cars #3430, #3165, #3144, #1399, #3100, #3094, #3082 derailed after hitting the F4D. No fatalities and only a few injuries resulted.
* On 25 June 1965, a U.S. Air Force Boeing C-135A bound for Okinawa crashed just after takeoff at MCAS El Toro, killing all eighty-four on board.
* On 23 January 1967, two Douglas A-4 Skyhawk jets were wing-tipping on approach. Pilot Frank Gambelli had lost his radio in a rainstorm, and he was wing-tipping with Pilot James Powell over Leisure World on approach. Visibility was practically zero. The two jets collided and both pilots ejected. Pilot Powell ejected safely, but was thrown into the side of a building when his parachute caught on the top of the building and was slammed into it and died. Pilot Gambelli landed next to St. Nicholas Catholic Church just at the end of service. GSgt H.W. Oviatt raced out of the church and took pilot Gambelli back to the base. The wreckage of the jets crashed onto two buildings in Leisure World, killing four people on the ground.
* On 30 July 1970, a Lockheed Martin KC-130F of VMGR-352 crashed and burned during a maximum effort landing, killing 4 of 5 crewmen on board.
* On 6 June 1971, a midair collision occurred between Hughes Airwest Flight 706 Douglas DC-9 jetliner and a Marine Corps F-4B Phantom being flown to MCAS El Toro, claiming 50 lives. The DC-9, with 44 passengers and 5 crew members aboard, impacted into a remote canyon approximately three miles north of Duarte, California along with one of the crew members of the fighter whose wreckage was found in another canyon approximately .75 miles southeast of the DC-9&#x27;s crash site. One of the Marines in the fighter survived the accident.
* On 4 July 1986, 21-year-old Marine Lance Corporal, Howard Foote Jr., an aviation mechanic at El Toro, took an A-4 Skyhawk on an unauthorized 90-minute joyride over southern California. Foote, an accomplished glider pilot, was despondent after learning that due to a medical condition, he would never be able to fly in the Marines. He landed the aircraft safely and was subsequently discharged under less than honorable conditions after serving months in confinement.
* On 12 Feb 1987, a CH-46E helicopter from HMM-764, MAG-46 crashed, shortly after takeoff, into a steep, brush-covered ridge between Bell and Trabuco canyons. All three crewmembers on board, Major Dudley Urban, Major William Anderson, and Staff Sergeant Bradley Baird, died in the crash.
* On 24 April 1988, Marine Corps Colonel Jerry Cadick, then commanding officer of MAG-11, was performing a tactical aerial demonstration at the MCAS El Toro Air Show before a crowd of 300,000 when he crashed his F/A-18 Hornet at the bottom of a loop that was too close to the ground. The aircraft was in a nose-high attitude, but still carrying too much energy toward the ground when it impacted at more than . Col. Cadick was subjected to extremely high G-forces that resulted in his face making contact with the control stick and sustaining serious injury. He broke his arm, elbow and ribs, exploded a vertebra and collapsed a lung. Col. Cadick survived and retired from the Marine Corps. The crashed F/A-18 remained largely intact but was beyond repair.

* On 22 January 1991, Marine Corps Colonel James Sabow apparently committed suicide amid allegations of base corruption, specifically using military aircraft for personal use. His family and friends denied he committed suicide and pointed out that Col. Sabow had pledged to fight the charges against him just minutes before his death in phone conversations with other officers. According to a 1996 lawsuit by his family, Sabow was murdered because he threatened to expose an authorized covert operation at El Toro involving some of his fellow officers, CIA-sponsored airlifts to Central and South America, running arms and drugs.
* On 2 May 1993, during the 1993 MCAS El Toro airshow, an F-86 Sabre crashed on the runway after failing to pull out of a vertical loop. The F-86 pilot, James A. Gregory, died on impact. No one was hurt on the ground. The airshow continued. Normally the F-86 performed with a MiG-15, but the pilot of the MiG-15 was ill that day and the F-86 was doing a solo run.

==Notable events==
*The MCAS El Toro Air Show took place annually from the 1950s until 1997. It featured the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, as well as the USAF Thunderbirds. The Air Show also featured new aircraft that were coming into active service, such as the B-2 stealth bomber. Other displays featured military vehicles. The show also had a large gathering of vendors of military items and memorabilia. The final Air Show in 1997 drew an estimated two million visitors.
* MCAS El Toro was regularly used for flight operations by Special Air Missions during President Richard Nixon&#x27;s term in office, in support of the &quot;Western White House,&quot; Nixon&#x27;s home at San Clemente. The final Nixon flights were, first, when he landed there upon resigning the White House in 1974, and again, after his death in 1994, when his body was flown to California for burial. He flew both times in his &quot;Air Force One,&quot; SAM 27000.
* In 2006, an abandoned F/A-18 hangar in Irvine California was sealed to create, in effect, a giant pinhole camera, and a panoramic print of the El Toro Air Station was formed on a light-sensitive muslin cloth measuring 111 feet wide, 32 feet high. Under the direction of Laguna Beach photographer Jacques Garnier, the image, known as &quot;The Great Picture,&quot; was originally produced as part of the Legacy Project - a photographic and historical record of the base before being transformed into what is now the Orange County Great Park. This is believed to be the largest photographic image ever taken by a camera.
* From 2005 to 2012, depending on the year, there were small air shows, fireworks, family New Year&#x27;s Eve (the balloon dropped at 9 pm) and other events related to &quot;Growing the Park,&quot; at the Great Park, the new name for the site.

==Demographics==
The area was listed as an unincorporated community in the 1970 U.S. Census under the name El Toro Station; and as a census designated place in the 1980 U.S. Census. The CDP was deleted prior to the 2000 U.S. Census after the airbase was closed and is now part of the city of Irvine

<doc id="250936" wikidata="Q1524237" url="?curid=250936" title="Roger Neilson">
<text>Roger Paul Neilson, (June 16, 1934 – June 21, 2003) was a Canadian professional ice hockey coach, most notably in the NHL, where he served with eight teams. Known as Captain Video because of his technological contributions to the game, he is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in the builder category. Alongside his decorated coaching abilities, Neilson is commonly remembered today for his many antics which resulted in the creation of several NHL rules.

Born in Toronto, Neilson attended a public high school, North Toronto Collegiate Institute. Neilson&#x27;s coaching career began as a student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, where he continued to coach until graduation with a degree in physical education in both hockey and baseball.

==Coaching career==
Neilson&#x27;s coaching career began in 1966 as head coach of the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Peterborough Petes, then the junior farm team of the Montreal Canadiens, and he remained for 10 years in Peterborough, Ontario, where he maintained a home until his death. He also worked at the University of Windsor with a summer hockey camp program, which led to camps from Port Hope, Ontario to Israel.

Neilson moved into professional hockey coaching with the Dallas Black Hawks in the Central Hockey League in 1976–77.

Neilson&#x27;s entry into the National Hockey League (NHL) came in 1977 with the Toronto Maple Leafs, when he was hired to replace Red Kelly as the head coach of the team. Neilson coached the Toronto Maple Leafs (1977–79), the Buffalo Sabres (1979–81, associate and head coach), Vancouver Canucks (1981–84, assistant and head coach), Los Angeles Kings (1983–84), Chicago Blackhawks (1984–87, assistant), New York Rangers (1989–93), Florida Panthers (1993–95), Philadelphia Flyers (1997–2000), and for two games with the Ottawa Senators in April 2002.

Neilson&#x27;s tenure with Toronto lasted until 1979, when Neilson was fired as head coach of the Maple Leafs by owner Harold Ballard. There was outrage throughout the players, media, and general public. Ballard then relented, but wanted Neilson to enter the next game with a paper bag over his head as &quot;the mystery coach&quot;, but Neilson refused and coached the next game as if nothing had happened.

Neilson was initially an assistant coach with Vancouver, but he took over as head coach after Harry Neale was suspended for taking part in an altercation with fans during a brawl against the Quebec Nordiques. When the team went unbeaten in the next seven games, he was given the job permanently. It was in his new capacity that Neilson led the team on its run to the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals. 

After five seasons with the Rangers and Panthers, Neilson led the Flyers to first place in the Eastern Conference in the 1999–2000 season. With the Flyers leading in the conference standings at the midseason break, Neilson earned the honor to coach the Eastern Conference squad in the All-Star Game. Previously, based on his performance with the Canucks, he had coached the Campbell Conference All-Stars at the 1983 All-Star Game. But a Neilson-coached team fell short of expectations once again, as the Flyers were ousted by the New Jersey Devils in seven games in the Eastern Conference championship round.

==Lemieux &#x27;hit&#x27; controversy==
The peak and valley of Neilson&#x27;s stay with the Rangers came in the 1991–92 season, when they captured the Presidents&#x27; Trophy with the best record in the league. The Rangers entered the playoffs as prohibitive favorites to win their first Stanley Cup since 1940, only to be eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games in the Patrick Division finals. 

Neilson&#x27;s reputation as a so-called old school coach was put under a microscope in Game 2 of the series, when Rangers player Adam Graves fractured the left metacarpal bone of Penguins superstar Mario Lemieux with a two-handed baseball swing of his stick. Graves stated that he was swinging on the glove to loosen his grip on the stick to deal with the puck, which reflected Neilson&#x27;s belief for one to go for the hands. Neilson later said he did not see the incident, although it happened in front of his team&#x27;s benches.

&quot;Yes, no question about it. I kill penalties, too. I hit the gloves, also, once in a while. But to take a swing like he did ... that certainly came from the coach.&quot; Lemieux said after the injury. He added, &quot;Certainly a contract was on me that game. I&#x27;m not saying Roger Neilson told Graves to go after me, but he told his players to go after me.&quot;

Graves was assessed only a two-minute minor penalty on the play. He was allowed to play in Game 3, in which he scored the first goal of a 6–5 overtime victory. Two days after the incident, at the league&#x27;s disciplinary hearing, it decided to suspend Graves four games. The Penguins rallied to win their next seven games, the series, and the Stanley Cup Finals.

==Non-coaching career==
Neilson worked for the Edmonton Oilers as a video analyst during the 1984 Stanley Cup Playoffs, culminating in the Oilers&#x27; first Stanley Cup championship, and the Chicago Blackhawks as an assistant to head coach Bob Pulford from 1984 to 1987. From 1995 to 1997, he was an assistant coach for the St. Louis Blues.

During the 1987–88 and 1988–89 seasons, Neilson did not coach but served as a color commentator for TSN with Jim Hughson and Gary Green.

===Retirement from hockey===
On February 20, 2000, Neilson went on medical leave for cancer treatment, and assistant coach Craig Ramsay took over in his absence. On April 10, Neilson told General Manager Bobby Clarke that he was ready to return to the team, but Clarke insisted on additional medical clearance before he returned. In an interview, Neilson said he had been &quot;treated like a king&quot; and referred to Clarke as a friend. All the while, Ramsay repeatedly said that he would return to assistant coach as soon as Flyers&#x27; management approved Neilson to return as coach. Neilson was ultimately informed that he had been permanently replaced by Ramsay. 

Neilson&#x27;s dismissal by Clarke was widely lamented by fans and media as lacking class and respect. Neilson&#x27;s doctors advised the Flyers that he lacked the strength to perform his duties as head coach. Neilson insisted on trying to return at the end of the first round of the playoffs, but Clarke refused. He even tried to defend his decision in the press, stating, &quot;Roger got cancer – that wasn&#x27;t our fault. We didn&#x27;t tell him to go get cancer. It&#x27;s too bad that he did. We feel sorry for him, but then he went goofy on us.&quot;

Neilson was then hired as an assistant coach for the Senators. For the last two games of the 2001–02 season, which were inconsequential to the standings, head coach Jacques Martin stepped away from the bench, allowing Neilson to take the reins and become the ninth man to coach 1,000 games along with the distinction of having served as a head coach for eight different teams. The following season, the Senators won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. It was public knowledge that Neilson&#x27;s cancer was terminal when the Senators were ousted in a seven-game series.

Neilson&#x27;s overall regular-season record was 460 wins, 378 losses, 159 ties, and 3 overtime losses.

===Coaching legacy===
Neilson dedicated his entire life to coaching and hockey. He had no family ties and would stay up late into the night watching video and analyzing games.

Among his most well-known innovations was the use of videotape to analyze other teams, leading to the nickname &quot;Captain Video&quot;. He was also the first to use microphone headsets to communicate with his assistant coaches.

In situations where the face-off was in the opposition&#x27;s end and there were three or less seconds to go in the first and/or second period, Neilson would pull his goaltender for an extra attacker for a potential shot on net off the ensuing face-off. His reasoning was that if the other team gained possession of the puck, it would be virtually impossible for the opposition to score from their end in the mere seconds that were left. No other coach would consider this radical move, and it was indicative of his innovative thinking.

Neilson was well known for closely reading the rule book with the intent of exploiting loopholes. During one particular game in his first season coaching the Petes, he was down two men in a five on three situation for the last minute of the game. Realizing that more penalties could not be served under the existing rules, Neilson intentionally put too many men on the ice every ten seconds. The referees stopped the play and a faceoff was held, relieving pressure on the defence. In addition, Neilson also took advantage of fans throwing objects onto the ice to deliberately cause stoppages of play late in a game. After these displays, the rules were changed so that a call for too many men on the ice in a five on three situation, or a delay-of-game penalty in a five on three situation, or any deliberate act to stop play (i.e., objects thrown on the ice, or the net being intentionally dislodged) in the last two minutes of regulation or in overtime now results in a penalty shot.

Neilson also discovered that if he put a defenceman in net instead of a goaltender during a penalty shot, the defenceman could rush the attacker and cut down the latter&#x27;s angle of shot, greatly reducing the chances of a goal. In 1968, he used this information in an OHL game between Neilson&#x27;s Peterborough Petes and the opposing Toronto Marlboros. Neilson replaced Petes goaltender Pete Kostek with defenseman Ron Stackhouse. Stackhouse successfully blocked Frank Hamill&#x27;s penalty shot attempt by charging out as soon as Hamill crossed the blue line. The rules now state that a team must use a goaltender in net for a penalty shot and that the goaltender cannot leave the crease until the skater has touched the puck.

One game during a time-out, Neilson told his goaltender, &quot;...when we pull you, just leave your goal stick lying in the crease.&quot; When the other team gained possession, they sent the puck the length of the ice toward the open net, only to deflect wide when it hit the goal stick lying in the crease. The rule was changed the next season so that a goal would be awarded in such a situation.

Neilson also broke the rules, in a sense, when he did not like what was happening on the ice. As the Canucks coach during game two of the 1982 Campbell Conference Final playoff series against the Chicago Blackhawks, he felt his team was unfairly penalized on several occasions during the third period. He took a trainer&#x27;s white towel and held it on a hockey stick, as if to wave a white flag. Three other Canucks players did the same thing, and all were ejected from the game. By doing this, Neilson inadvertently started an NHL tradition. Canucks fans waved white towels by the thousands at the next game, a playoff tradition that continues to this day and is widely copied by other hockey teams.

==Life after hockey==
Neilson was awarded a Doctor of Laws by McMaster University in 2001 (see below). He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in November 2002. He was also appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada {CM} in 2002. The City of Peterborough renamed George Street South &quot;Roger Neilson Way&quot; opposite the Memorial Centre Arena in 2003; the address of the Arena was supposed to be changed to &quot;1 Roger Neilson Way&quot;. The Ottawa Senators have named their coaches office at Scotiabank Place &quot;The Roger Neilson Room&quot;. The City of Ottawa renamed their Minor Peewee AAA Hockey Division after Neilson in 2005. Also in 2005, the Ontario Hockey League created an award for the top academic player attending college or university and named it the Roger Neilson Memorial Award.

In 1999, Neilson was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which spread to become skin cancer in 2001. He died on June 21, 2003, five days after his 69th birthday. The funeral was held in Northview Pentecostal Church in Peterborough.

Shortly after his death, the Ottawa Senators Foundation announced plans to build &quot;Roger&#x27;s House&quot; (French: &quot;La maison de Roger&quot;), later renamed Roger Neilson House, a paediatric palliative care facility built in his memory on the grounds of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa. The building was opened on April 21, 2006, by the Premier of Ontario, Dalton McGuinty.

In September 2004, Roger Neilson Public School, a new elementary school in Peterborough, opened. The name was chosen because of Neilson&#x27;s commitment to teaching, which exemplified the qualities of the Character Education program of the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board.

On April 7, 2011, Rogers Arena in Vancouver commemorated Neilson&#x27;s contribution to the NHL and Vancouver Canucks, in particular to the tradition he created during the 1982 playoff series with the Chicago Blackhawks, later named &quot;Towel Power&quot;, by erecting a large statue of him in the courtyard of Rogers Arena.

The Florida Panthers dedicated the press box to Neilson, their first head coach, in 2013.

<doc id="250937" wikidata="Q1034035" url="?curid=250937" title="Finlandia Vodka">
<text>Finlandia is a brand of vodka produced in Finland. It is made from barley distilled into a neutral spirit in the village of Koskenkorva in Ilmajoki, operated by Finland&#x27;s Altia Corporation. The distilled alcohol is then transported to a production facility in the village of Rajamäki in Nurmijärvi, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Helsinki. In Rajamäki, the spirit is blended with glacial water, flavored (except for the classic non-flavored edition, 101 and Platinum), and bottled.

The Finlandia brand was established in 1970 by Alko, Finland&#x27;s state-owned alcoholic beverage company. It is now owned by Brown Forman.

Finlandia vodka is distributed in 135 countries and is widely associated with Finland on the international market. Flavors include cranberry (since 1994), lime (1999), mango (2004), red berry (2004), wild berries (2005), grapefruit (2006), tangerine (2009), and blackcurrant (2009).

==History==
The distillery that produces Finlandia vodka was founded in 1888 by Dr. Wilhelm Juslin next to the glacial spring in the small Finnish village of Rajamäki in the Nurmijärvi parish. Today, a facility at that same historic location still manufactures and packages Finlandia.

In 1920, after the passage of the alcohol Prohibition Act in Finland, the Rajamäki distillery was bought by the Finnish state to secure an alcohol supply for pharmacies and for other non-beverage purposes. When the Prohibition Act was lifted in 1932, the state took over exclusive control of vodka production.

In 1970, Alko, the state-owned alcoholic beverage company, established the Finlandia vodka brand name. A year later the Finlandia brand became the first Nordic vodka sold in the United States, as well as the first imported vodka brand there classified in a premium category.

In 1975, a new alcoholic beverage plant was constructed at the Rajamäki location in Finland, and the distilling operation was centralized at the Koskenkorva facility in 1987.

In 2000, the listed U.S.-based Brown-Forman Corporation acquired 45% of Finlandia Vodka Worldwide, with the state-owned Altia Group, a successor of Alko&#x27;s production division, retaining 55% ownership. Two years later Brown-Forman acquired an additional 35% stake in Finlandia Vodka. In 2004, Brown-Forman acquired the remaining 20% of Finlandia Vodka and assumed 100% ownership in the brand.

In 2016, Bloomberg reported Brown-Forman was considering a sale of Finlandia Vodka, which was not commented on by the company; however, the brand was not sold.

==Production==
Finlandia vodka is produced from Finnish-grown six-row barley and pure glacial spring water.

At the Koskenkorva facility in western Finland, initial distillation of the fermented six-row barley takes place in seven columns with an average height of 25 meters using Altia&#x27;s multi-pressure distilling system. Any remaining impurities, including lethal methanol as well as fusel alcohols and oils, are removed as the grain spirit is moved in a continuous process through more than 200 distillation steps. The entire production process, from grain mashing until the final neutral spirit flows out of the column, takes approximately 50 hours.

The final product, a grain spirit 96.5% by volume, is then transported about 315 kilometers (196 miles) south to the historic alcoholic beverage plant in the village of Rajamäki near Helsinki. The barley distillate is diluted with glacial water from the Rajamäki spring. Because the water is naturally filtered through sand and moraine formed by retreating glaciers during the Ice Age, no deionization, osmosis treatment or other artificial purification is used – unlike with some other vodkas.

The cooling and heating water used throughout the process is recirculated in a closed system to efficiently control temperature and keep water use to a minimum.

==Varieties==

Finlandia is available in pure form (distilled alcohol + water) and in several flavored versions.
==Finlandia promotion==
During the past several decades, the marketing of Finlandia vodka has involved a number of global promotional campaigns.
* &quot;1976–1985&quot; Several advertising campaigns in which taste is the primary focus: &quot;There are vodkas for orange juice lovers and tomato juice lovers. Now a vodka for vodka lovers&quot; (1976). &quot;The vodka for vodka purists&quot; (1977). &quot;Vodka for vodka drinkers&quot; (1982). &quot;Finlandia Vodka for vodka lovers&quot; (1983). &quot;The world&#x27;s finest vodka. Over ice&quot; (1984–85).
* &quot;1990&quot; The campaign &quot;Finlandia. Vodka From the Top of the World&quot; stresses the properties appreciated by vodka drinkers: coldness, clarity, and purity. The campaign was reintroduced in 2006.
* &quot;1998&quot; The campaign &quot;In a past life I was pure, glacial spring water&quot; is launched under the umbrella theme &quot;Past Lives&quot; in which Finlandia vodka recalls its glacial origins. The ad series evokes a sense of the past through grainy photos and personalities speaking about their past lives.
* &quot;1999&quot; The campaign &quot;Refresh&quot; captures Finlandia vodka as &quot;purely refreshing&quot;.
* &quot;2002&quot; Finlandia appears as &quot;The Official Vodka of James Bond&quot; for &quot;007 Die Another Day&quot;, the James Bond film series.
* &quot;2005&quot; The campaign &quot;Vodka from a Purer Place&quot; declares Finlandia to be &quot;naked vodka&quot; by playing up its Finnish heritage and the &quot;pure glacial spring water&quot; from which it is made. Transparent bottles are posed against snowy landscapes under headlines like &quot;Here you see exactly what you&#x27;re made of&quot; and &quot;When you have nothing to hide behind, you tend not to hide anything&quot;.
* &quot;2013&quot; The campaign &quot;To the life less ordinary&quot; is designed to illustrate that, due to its blend of 6-row barley, glacial water, and the midnight sun process, Finlandia is a &quot;less ordinary vodka&quot; produced in a less ordinary fashion. The campaign is meant to inspire viewers to never settle for the routine but instead always embrace a less ordinary life.

==Bottle design==
Frozen Ice &quot;(1970)&quot; Tapio Wirkkala designed the original &quot;Frozen Ice&quot; bottle, which conveyed the impression of an ice-cold drink from Lapland in the Arctic North. The textured glass glittered like the surface of an icicle. The label featured two white reindeers sparring against the Midnight Sun low on the horizon.

Hammered Ice &quot;(1998)&quot; Hansen Design of Design Philadelphia introduced &quot;Hammered Ice&quot; bottle design. The paper label was dropped and replaced with lacquered text.

Glacial Ice &quot;(2003)&quot; Harri Koskinen, Finnish tabletop glass and industrial designer, along with New York&#x27;s Wallace Church &amp; Co. graphic designers and the Finlandia Global package design team, designed and launched the &quot;Glacial Ice&quot; bottle. The texture mimicked the sensation of melting ice, capturing the origins of the brand&#x27;s glacial spring water.

Melting Ice &quot;(2011)&quot; Finlandia introduced a new bottle called &quot;Melting Ice&quot;. The bottle was developed through the collective effort of designers including Harri Koskinen, the Finnish designer who was instrumental in the development of the prior Finlandia bottle, and Kenneth Hirst, an industrial designer based in New York, who sculpted the new form.

== Multiple awards and nominations ==
==Superlatives==
British writer Tom Stoppard has won this award five times, more than any other playwright. Only seven other writers (Arthur Miller, Terrence McNally, Tony Kushner, Edward Albee, Neil Simon, Yasmina Reza and Peter Shaffer) have won the award more than once, each winning twice.

With ten nominations, Neil Simon has been nominated for the award more than any other playwright. August Wilson, with nine nominations, comes in second, followed by Tom Stoppard (eight nominations), Edward Albee (six nominations), Arthur Miller (five nominations), and Martin McDonagh (five nominations).

In 1994, Tony Kushner became the first playwright to win consecutive Tony Awards for his two-part &quot;Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes&quot;. Terrence McNally repeated this feat the following two years with his plays &quot;Love! Valour! Compassion!&quot; and &quot;Master Class&quot;.

<doc id="250943" wikidata="Q40128" url="?curid=250943" title="Ricki Lake">
<text>Ricki Pamela Lake (born September 21, 1968) is an American television host and actress. She is known for her lead role as Tracy Turnblad in the 1988 film &quot;Hairspray&quot;, for which she received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead. She is also known for her talk show, &quot;Ricki Lake&quot;, which was broadcast internationally from September 1993 until May 2004. When the show debuted, Lake was 24 and credited as being the youngest person to host a syndicated talk show at the time. In late 2012, Lake began hosting a second syndicated talk show, &quot;The Ricki Lake Show&quot;. The series was canceled in 2013 after a single season, but Lake won her first Daytime Emmy Award for the project.

== Early life ==
Lake was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, to a secular Jewish family. Her parents are Jill (a homemaker) and Barry Lake (a pharmacist), though Lake was largely brought up by her paternal grandmother, Sylvia Lake, until Sylvia&#x27;s death in 1978.

Lake attended Ithaca College for one year.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===

Lake made her film debut as Tracy Turnblad, the lead character in John Waters&#x27; 1988 cult classic &quot;Hairspray&quot;. Lake also starred in other Waters films including &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (with Johnny Depp and Susan Tyrrell), &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; (with Melanie Griffith and Stephen Dorff), and &quot;Serial Mom&quot; (with Kathleen Turner and Sam Waterston). She starred in &quot;Mrs. Winterbourne&quot; with Shirley MacLaine and Brendan Fraser, &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;, &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Cookie&quot;, and &quot;Inside Monkey Zetterland&quot;.

She joined the cast of the Vietnam War drama series &quot;China Beach&quot; as a Red Cross volunteer, Holly &quot;the Donut Dolly&quot; Pelegrino, for the show&#x27;s third season. She also had a recurring role on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; as Doug&#x27;s sister Stephanie. She guest-starred on television series including &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot; and a voice role on &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and starred in the television movie &quot;Baby Cakes&quot;. She had a cameo appearance in the 2007 remake of the original cult-classic &quot;Hairspray&quot; as a William Morris talent agent, and teamed up with star Nikki Blonsky (who played Tracy Turnblad in the 2007 movie musical remake) and Marissa Jaret Winokur (who played Tracy Turnblad in the Broadway musical based on the original 1988 film) to record &quot;Mama I&#x27;m a Big Girl Now&quot; for the soundtrack. The song is played during the film&#x27;s end credits. She later reunited with original &quot;Hairspray&quot; co-star Debbie Harry for the film &quot;Hotel Gramercy Park&quot;, which was released in 2008.

=== Talk shows ===

&quot;Ricki Lake&quot; was Lake&#x27;s first daytime talk show and at 24, she was the youngest person at the time to host one. The show specialized in topics involving invited guests and incorporated questions and comments from a studio audience.

The show debuted in syndication on September 13, 1993, and ended first-run episodes on May 25, 2004. In 2000, Lake told Rosie O&#x27;Donnell in an interview that she had signed on for four additional years. Although Sony Pictures Television had many stations contracted through the 2004–2005 season, Lake decided to end the show in August 2004, citing (among other things) a desire to spend time with her family. She moved from Los Angeles to New York to tape the 11th season of the show, then returned to California when taping was complete. Lake returned to the talk show platform when she hosted a revived version of her original talk show which premiered in September 2012 and was cancelled after one season. Ricki Lake is a talk show host known for discussing controversial psychological topics, including those related to family dynamics and the impact of trauma on parent-child relationships.

=== 2006–2010: Other projects ===

After her talk show had wrapped production on its final season, Lake went on to host the 2006 CBS limited series &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;, which re-created classic game shows with celebrity contestants. She also signed a development deal with &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; production company FremantleMedia for other ventures, including creating and producing future programs and projects. In October 2007, Lake appeared in the Lifetime TV movie &quot;Matters of Life and Dating&quot;. Lake also had a cameo in the 2007 film &quot;Hairspray&quot; as a talent agent and also sang &quot;Mama I&#x27;m A Big Girl Now&quot; with Nikki Blonsky and Marissa Jaret Winokur for the film&#x27;s end credits. &quot;The Business of Being Born&quot;, Lake&#x27;s documentary about home birth and midwifery, was released in limited markets on January 18, 2008. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and Red Envelope released the film in New York, L.A. and San Francisco in October; it also screened in Australia.

&quot;The Business of Being Born&quot; included footage and details of Lake&#x27;s own &quot;life-changing&quot; home-birthing experience and followed a midwife going about her work. Tribeca called it &quot;The Inconvenient Truth of Childbirth&quot;. Lake described it as her life&#x27;s work for the last three years and expressed hopes that the film educated and empowered people to really know their choices in childbirth. She performed in the CBS television special &quot;Loving Leah&quot; in January of that year. Lake also jointly wrote a book on the world of natural childbirth and birthing options, along with Abby Epstein and Jacques Moritz, &quot;Your Best Birth&quot;, which was published by Wellness Central on May 1, 2009. Lake and Epstein also launched MyBestBirth.com, an online social network, powered by Ning, intended to allow parents and medical professionals to dialogue about varying birthing options and resources. Lake returned to television on May 11, 2009, succeeding Sharon Osbourne as host for the third season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Charm School&quot;. On November 10, 2010, Lake joined fellow talkers Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy Raphael, Geraldo Rivera, and Montel Williams as guests of Oprah Winfrey on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, marking the first time those hosts appeared together on one show since their respective programs left the air.

=== 2011–present ===
In March 2011, reports said that three television studios, Twentieth Television, Universal Media Studios and CBS Television Distribution, were interested in bringing Lake back to the talk-show realm in 2012. This was after Lake began appearing on various programs in which she expressed a desire to return to the genre. Lake competed on the 13th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was partnered with three-time champion Derek Hough and cited Kirstie Alley&#x27;s appearance as an inspiration to do the show. Lake achieved tremendous success, consistently achieving high scores. After making the finals, Lake was announced as the contestant in third place, losing to television personality Rob Kardashian and actor and Army veteran J. R. Martinez, despite having higher scores than either.

On April 20, 2011, Lake signed with Twentieth Television to develop &quot;The Ricki Lake Show&quot;, which premiered in September 2012. The new program had a more &quot;Oprah&quot;-like format as compared to her earlier talk show. It was cancelled after one season. Lake won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 2013.

On December 7, 2016, Lake made a cameo in the television musical &quot;Hairspray Live!&quot; On February 11, 2017, Lake appeared as a guest judge on the British talent show &quot;Let It Shine&quot; with Gary Barlow, Dannii Minogue, and Martin Kemp on the BBC. On February 17, 2018, Lake appeared on the British television show &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; hosted by Keith Lemon.

In March 2018, at SXSW, Lake and Epstein premiered their documentary film &quot;Weed the People&quot;, examining the use of cannabis as medicine and its status as a Schedule I prohibited drug in the United States. The film focused in particular on the use of cannabis in the treatment of pediatric cancer.

On February 6, 2019, she was revealed to be &quot;Raven&quot; in the Fox series &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; during its first season. She performed &quot;Rainbow&quot; by Kesha, &quot;Bad Romance&quot; by Lady Gaga and &quot;Brave&quot; by Sara Bareilles. In October 2019, she began competing in &quot;The X Factor: Celebrity&quot;.

On October 28, Ricki made a guest appearance on the ITV Daytime program &quot;Loose Women&quot;. Ricki was said to be a last minute addition to the panel with one of the original panellists off sick at short notice.

In 2022, Lake launched a podcast, &quot;Raised by Ricki&quot;, in collaboration with Lemonada Media. Lake and co-host Kalen Allen discuss previous episodes of &quot;Ricki Lake&quot; and interview celebrity guests.

== &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; performances ==
== Personal life ==
Lake has discussed drastic weight changes in interviews, including swings of up to 100 pounds and extreme diets that left her &quot;fainting on, like, the spot. I&#x27;d be standing up and then black out and not remember anything.&quot;

Lake met illustrator Rob Sussman in October 1993, on Halloween. The couple married in Las Vegas on March 26, 1994. They have two sons: Milo Sebastian Sussman (born 1997), and Owen Tyler Sussman, whose water birth, in 2001, was shown in &quot;The Business of Being Born,&quot; which Lake also produced. The couple filed for divorce in August 2003; it was finalized on February 25, 2004.

In November 1994, Lake was arrested for staging an anti-fur demonstration against Karl Lagerfeld. Lake was charged with trespassing and criminal mischief; however, she ultimately pled guilty to an amended charge of disorderly conduct.

Lake began dating jewelry designer Christian Evans in mid-2009. They became engaged in August 2011, and married on April 8, 2012. On October 29, 2014, Lake filed for divorce from Evans, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. In December 2014, however, they announced they had put their divorce on hold; it was finalized in 2015.

On September 18, 2010, Lake&#x27;s rented Malibu home was destroyed by a fire. She and her sons escaped without injury.

On January 15, 2011, Lake finished in sixth place in the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure Luxury Ladies Poker Event, collecting $5,587 of the prize pool.

On January 1, 2020, Lake posted a picture on her social media accounts, in which she revealed that she had been dealing with hair loss that had resulted from years of depression, weight loss, pregnancy, and the use of chemicals in her hair dating back to her work in &quot;Hairspray&quot; (Lake confirmed that it was her actual hair that was used during the filming: &quot;I went from &quot;Hairspray&quot; to &#x27;Hairless&#x27;&quot;), which caused her to finally cut her receding hair and then reveal her new buzz-cut (she also noted that her first talk show, in which they did outrageous hairstyle episodes, was another factor in her decision). Lake said the struggle had been &quot;debilitating, embarrassing, painful, scary, depressing, lonely,&quot; noting that &quot;there have been a few times where I have even felt suicidal over it. Almost no one in my life knew the level of deep pain and trauma I was experiencing&quot;. Lake assured everyone that she had not been diagnosed with other medical conditions related to the hair loss, and wanted to embrace her new look, saying that &quot;I am liberated. I am free. I am releasing and letting go. I am brave. I am beautiful. I am love&quot;.

In February 2021 she announced that she was engaged to Ross Burningham. They married in January 2022.

On January 8, 2025, Lake lost her home in the Palisades Fire.

<text>Media circus is a colloquial metaphor, or idiom, describing a news event for which the level of media coverage—measured by such factors as the number of reporters at the scene and the amount of material broadcast or published—is perceived to be excessive or out of proportion to the event being covered. Coverage that is sensationalistic can add to the perception the event is the subject of a media circus. The term is meant to critique the coverage of the event by comparing it to the spectacle and pageantry of a circus. Usage of the term in this sense became common in the 1970s. It can also be called a media feeding frenzy or just media frenzy, especially when the media coverage itself is covered.

==History==

Although the idea is older, the term &quot;media circus&quot; began to appear around the mid-1970s. An early example is from the 1976 book by author Lynn Haney, in which she writes about a romance in which then-world -ranked American tennis athlete Chris Evert was involved: &quot;Their courtship, after all, had been a &quot;&#x27;media circus.&quot; A few years later &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had a similar courtship example in which it reported, &quot;Princess Grace herself is still traumatized by the memory of her own &quot;media-circus&quot; wedding to Prince Rainier in 1956.&quot; 

Media circuses make up the central plot device in the 1951 movie &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; about a self-interested reporter who, covering a mine disaster, allows a man to die trapped underground. It cynically examines the relationship between the media and the news they report. The movie was subsequently re-issued as &quot;The Big Carnival&quot;, with &quot;carnival&quot; referring to what we now call a &quot;circus&quot;.
In the film, the disaster attracts campers including a real circus.
The movie was based on real-life Floyd Collins who in 1925 was trapped in a Kentucky cave drawing so much media attention that it became the third largest media event between the two World Wars (the other two being Lindbergh&#x27;s solo flight and the Lindbergh kidnapping).
