<text>Dionne Brand (born 7 January 1953) is a Canadian poet, novelist, essayist and documentarian. She was Toronto&#x27;s third Poet Laureate from September 2009 to November 2012 and first Black Poet Laureate. She was admitted to the Order of Canada in 2017 and has won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Poetry, the Trillium Prize for Literature, the Pat Lowther Award for Poetry, the Harbourfront Writers&#x27; Prize, and the Toronto Book Award. Brand currently resides in Toronto.

==Early life and education==
Dionne Brand was born in Guayaguayare, Trinidad and Tobago. She graduated from Naparima Girls&#x27; High School in San Fernando, Trinidad, in 1970 and emigrated to Canada. She attended the University of Toronto and earned a BA degree (English and Philosophy) in 1975 and later attained an MA in Philosophy of Education from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) in 1989.
==Career==
Her first book, &quot;Fore Day Morning: Poems&quot;, came out in 1978, and since then Brand has published numerous works of poetry, fiction and non-fiction, as well as editing anthologies and working on documentary films with the National Film Board of Canada.

She has held a number of academic positions, including:

*Assistant Professor of English, University of Guelph (1992–94)
*Ruth Wynn Woodward Professor in Women&#x27;s Studies, Simon Fraser University 
*Distinguished Visiting Scholar and Writer-in-Residence, St. Lawrence University, Canton, New York (2004–05)
*Distinguished Poet for the Ralph Gustafson Poetry Chair, Vancouver Island University (2006)
*She is currently Professor of English at the School of English and Theatre Studies at the University of Guelph, where she also holds a University Research Chair.

In 2017, she was appointed as poetry editor of McClelland &amp; Stewart, an imprint of Penguin Random House Canada. Brand is also a co-editor of Toronto-based literary journal &quot;Brick&quot;.

==Writing==
Brand explores themes of gender, race, sexuality, feminism, diaspora, nation, white male domination, injustices and &quot;the moral hypocrisies of Canada&quot; Despite being often characterized as a Caribbean writer, Brand identifies as a &quot;black Canadian&quot;.

She has contributed to many anthologies opposing the violent killings of Black men and women, the massacre of 14 women in Montreal, and racism and inequality as experienced by Aboriginal women of Canada, particularly Helen Betty Osborne&#x27;s death in the Pas.

===&quot;A Map to the Door of No Return&quot;===

Brand explores intergenerational trauma and post memory in her piece &quot;A Map to A Door of No Return&quot;. Using a variety of different elements, she explores her own experiences through an autobiographical perspective as well as diving into explain a concept she calls &quot;The Door of No Return&quot;. The Door is the space in which the history of black people is lost, specifically when slaves from Africa were transported through the Atlantic slave trade. Brand defines the Door of No Return as &quot;that place where our ancestors departed one world for another; the Old World for the New.&quot; It is a place that is as metaphorical as it is psychological, as imaginary as it is real. It is not a physical door, in the sense that it be found at a single location, but rather a collection of locations. At the same time, however, the Door can bring profound grief and pain to many in the Diaspora when they visit it—for example, at the slave caves in Ghana or Gorée Island—or encounter it, as Brand does when she flies over it and feels overwhelmed, tense, consumed with thoughts and feelings and images. The Door is a site of traceable beginnings that are left at the doorsteps, eventually forgotten and lost in historical and familial memory, as demonstrated when Brand&#x27;s grandfather can no longer remember the name of the ancestral people they belong to. When passing through The Door, people lost their history, their humanity, and their ancestry. This trauma is still felt by black people today, which is the perspective from which Brand explores the concept. She gives examples of this through sports. she writes: &quot;I hear my neighbour downstairs enter Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s body every night of the NBA Championships this year&quot; Brand also describes how her interactions with her grandfather eventually became &quot;mutually disappointing&quot; and led to estrangement, as he could not remember the name of their tribe, the people they came from, and could not, thus, remember their family history. Essentially, Brand&#x27;s short anecdote is about the insufficiency of memory and how incredibly limiting that is. The &quot;fissure&quot; that developed between her grandfather and herself parallels the &quot;fissure between the past and the present&quot;, that gap in memory, as represented by the Door of No Return. There is a sort of historical, intergenerational trauma that is associated with this loss of memory, as those in the Diaspora can feel profound grief and pain from their interactions with the Door of No Return (&quot;one does not return to the Diaspora with good news from the door&quot;).

Brand begins &quot;A Map to the Door of No Return&quot; by recounting her long-standing struggle with her grandfather to remember where their ancestors were from. She marks this as being the first time she felt a burning desire to know her ancestry, stating that &quot;a small space opened in [her]&quot; (Brand 4) and that not knowing was &quot;profoundly disturbing&quot; (Brand 5). She describes this moment of recognition as reaching the door of no return; a place where our ancestors departed one world for another (Brand 5). In this moment, she is confronted with the reality that her life will consist of a never ending battle to complete her identity. Brand is intentional to note that her desire only came into full effect when she was denied knowledge of her ancestry. Contrary to Frantz Fanon&#x27;s theory that the pivotal moment in a Black child&#x27;s life is the moment when they come in contact with the white world and are confronted with the full weight of their blackness, Brand&#x27;s awakening was not dependent on the white world. The onset of her inner struggle to find belonging and self-assuredness occurred in an entirely black space. This feeling of being incomplete is common among Black people throughout the diaspora and, as Brand demonstrates, and is one of the driving forces in her desire to know her ancestry.

As with her struggle to remember her ancestors, Brand suggests that black individuals experience the sort of &quot;double consciousness&quot; that W. E. B. Du Bois discusses in his work &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&#x27;, the idea of having to understand two different approaches as they go through life.

Another theme explored in &quot;A Map to the Door of No Return&quot; is the theory and praxis of geography. In the text, Brand references several maps, geographers, and ideas related to geography and navigation (e.g. the Babylonian map, David Turnbull and &quot;way-finding&quot;, Charles Bricker, the North Star and the Big Dipper, etc.) Juxtaposing these references to her analyses and reflections, she begins to deconstruct and challenge the systems of logic that constitute geography and borders, the way geography has been constructed and hailed as truth, and the emphasis we place on origins when we should not, as origins are not only arbitrary, but they also reproduce the violence of the nation-state. As seen in her explanation, analysis, and subsequent application of Charles Bricker&#x27;s notes on Ludolf and how asinine he (Ludolf) was, it&#x27;s apparent that geography and the knowledge that is produced from this discipline is flawed.

Brand uses figurative language in the text. Water, doors, the radio and memory figure boldly and lyrically. Through this figurative language, Brand links form and content where the figurativeness of her language, mimics the literal images of slavery that Brand witnessed on her journey to Africa. Her metaphors also help elaborate and emphasize her thoughts, and the understanding of the door. As she puts it, &quot;The door casts a haunting spell on personal and collective consciousness in the Diaspora.&quot;

===&quot;Rivers Have Sources, Trees Have Roots&quot;===
In &quot;Rivers Have Sources, Trees Have Roots&quot; (1986), Brand and co-author Krisantha Sri Bhaggiyadatta interviewed a hundred people from the Canadian Native, Black, Chinese, and South Asian communities about their perceptions of racism and its impact on their lives. The authors critiqued the existence and ubiquity of racism, disparities and resistance, arguing that two themes exist where racism prevails in their interviewees&#x27; lives: through &quot;the culture of racism&quot; and through structural and institutional ways.

&quot;Rivers&quot; gives each individual an opportunity to speak about his or her personal and migration story. The interviewees speak of their anger, resentments, and complaints of being treated as different and inferior. Brand sees racism as a powerful tool to censor oppositional voices and disagrees with the conception of racism as isolated or unusual.

=== &quot;No Language Is Neutral&quot; ===
&quot;No Language is Neutral&quot; was originally published in 1990 by Coach House Press. It is a 50-page tour-de-force which tackles issues of immigration, environmentalism, slavery, lesbian love, identity, place and the female body, all from a no-holds-barred Black feminist perspective. The title of the book indicates that Brand is in conversation with writers of the Black Diaspora, namely Derek Walcott. Susan Gingell goes as far as to call him her &quot;antithetical literary ancestor&quot; whose views Brand fights against and rewrites in &quot;No Language is Neutral&quot;. She is calling out Walcott, who in her opinion plays to the belief that &quot;colonization brought civilization, brought culture&quot;. She confidently posits herself as the antidote to Walcott: he is the &quot;Black colonial&quot; who through literature dances with oppression instead of fighting it. In the Caribbean context, Brand&#x27;s literary forebears had almost been exclusively male so her take in &quot;No Language is Neutral&quot; is of particular importance and her calling out of Walcott even more revolutionary.

Coach House Press contracted Grace Channer to do the cover art of the book. Cohesive with Brand&#x27;s vision, Channer produced a cover which depicts the bare breasts of a woman caressed by a hardened fist. The cover plays with the softness of themes such as love and desire but the hardened fist is there as a reminder of the difficult politics Brand is confronting in this volume. In her acknowledgements Brand thanks Ted Chamberlin, Michael Ondaatje and The Sisterhood to the Toronto Black Women&#x27;s Collective. &quot;No Language is Neutral&quot; is blurbed by Michelle Cliff, Dorothy Livesay, Nicole Brossard and Betsy Warland.

The critic Winfried Siemerling described &quot;No Language is Neutral&quot; as a &quot;breakthrough volume&quot; for its uninhibitedness. In 1991 the critic Ronald B. Hatch wrote that the &quot;highly provocative material&quot; in &quot;No Language Is Neutral&quot; coupled with &quot;the Trinidadian English&quot; was &quot;monotonous&quot; and lacked &quot;imagistic representation&quot;. He said that the fault in &quot;No Language is Neutral&quot; was that it was &quot;highly formal&quot; and &quot;highly rationalist&quot; as if expecting Brand to write the opposite because of her &quot;other&quot;/ &quot;exotic&quot; status. Brand, however, did not conform to any of these expectations, as can be seen in her later work too. Her incorporation of Patois in her prose-like poems for example continued way past &quot;No Language is Neutral&quot;.

&quot;&quot;No Language Is Neutral&quot;, sold over 6,000 copies, a remarkable number, even with a Governor General&#x27;s Award nomination.&quot; Today, it has been adopted into school curricula Canada-wide.

===&quot;St. Mary Estate&quot;===
Personal experience and ancestral memory inform her short story &quot;St. Mary Estate&quot;, from &quot;Sans Souci and Other Stories&quot;, pp. 360–366. The narrator, accompanied by her sister, revisits the cocoa estate of their birth and childhood, recalling past experiences of racism and shame. She focuses on the summer beach house belonging to &quot;rich whites&quot; that was cleaned by their mother, the daughter of her overseer grandfather. Her anger over discrimination and poverty is triggered by the recollection of living quarters made of thin cardboard with newspapers walls - barracks that depict the physical, social and psychological degradation endured by the slaves who were denied the basic human rights and freedom.

===&quot;This Body For Itself&quot;===
In &quot;This Body For Itself&quot; (1994), in &quot;Bread Out of Stone&quot;, Brand discusses the way the black female body is represented. She asserts that in male authored texts, the black female body is often portrayed as motherly or virginal. In female authored texts, the black female body is often portrayed as protector and/or resistor to rape. Brand states that it is understandable why this happens. The avoidance of portraying black female bodies as sexual is out of self-preservation, as black female bodies are often overly sexualized in their portrayal. However, Brand argues that this self-preservation is a trap, because desire and sexuality can be a great source of power, and suppressing this only further suppresses female power to own their own desire. She writes, &quot;The most radical strategy of the female body for itself is the lesbian body confessing all the desire and fascination for itself&quot; (p. 108).

=== &quot;Chronicles of the Hostile Sun&quot; ===
Brand wrote many of the poems in her fifth book of poetry, &quot;Chronicles of the Hostile Sun&quot;, in response to the United States military occupation of Grenada. Brand had been living in Grenada and working for a Canadian non-profit organization when the United States invasion of the island took place. The Reagan Administration sanctioned the military invasion in response to the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary political party, the New Jewel Movement, led by Maurice Bishop, who became Prime Minister of the island after a coup in 1979. He was arrested and assassinated in the days leading up to the invasion in 1983. Brand&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of the Hostile Sun,&quot; published one year later in 1984, is divided into three sections: Languages, Sieges, and Military Occupations. Poems in the lattermost section refer directly to Grenada, including mentions of Bishop and other prominent political leaders, the island&#x27;s socio-political landscape, and scenes during and after the harrowing invasion. Titles in this section are often dates of significant events during the occupation, including &quot;October 19th, 1983,&quot; the day Bishop was assassinated and &quot;October 25th, 1983,&quot; the day the U.S. military began the invasion. The poem &quot;On American numeracy and literacy in the war against Grenada&quot; places the occupation in the broader context of revolution and U.S. military action in Cuba and El Salvador.

===Other themes===
Other topics addressed in Brand&#x27;s writing include the sexual exploitation of African women. Brand says, &quot;We are born thinking of travelling back.&quot; She writes: &quot;Listen, I am a Black woman whose ancestors were brought to a new world laying tightly packed in ships. Fifteen million of them survived the voyage, five million of them women; millions among them died, were killed, committed suicide in the middle passage.&quot;

Brand has received numerous awards. Writer Myriam Chancy says Brand found &quot;it possible ...to engage in personal/critical work which uncovers the connections between us as Black women at the same time as re-discovering that which has been kept from us: our cultural heritage, the language of our grandmothers, ourselves.&quot;

== Filmmaking ==
Brand made a number of documentaries with NFB&#x27;s feminist-film production unit, Studio D, from 1989 to 1996. When Studio D was criticized for its lack of diversity, Rina Fraticelli, the executive producer at the time, created a program called New Initiatives in Film (NIF). It was out of this program that Brand partnered with Ginny Stikeman to create the award-winning &quot;Sisters in the Struggle&quot; (1991), a &quot;look at Black women in community, labour and feminist organizing&quot;. This was part of the Women at the Well trilogy that also included &quot;Older, Stronger, Wiser&quot; (1989) and &quot;Long Time Comin″&quot; (1991). Brand&#x27;s collaboration with producer Stikeman also became the &quot;model for the Internship Component of NIF&quot;, which offered production experience at various regional studios across Canada and at Studio D in Montreal. Brand&#x27;s film &quot;Older, Stronger, Wiser&quot; (1989), which &quot;features five black women talking about their lives in urban and rural Canada between the 1920s and 1950s&quot;, and &quot;Sisters in the Struggle&quot;, were both distinct films in that they broke away from the mid-1980s survey films and instead focused on local issues to Canadian women.

Brand did not have pointed interest in filmmaking until an opportunity arose to consult on a documentary about racism at Studio D. A white filmmaker was the lead on the project and after meeting with her for several days, Brand decided she did not want to be a part of the film. She told the Studio that she would be willing to &quot;do something about Black women from their point of view,&quot; which resulted in &quot;Long Time Comin″&quot;.

Brand directed &quot;Listening for Something… Adrienne Rich and Dionne Brand in Conversation&quot; (1996), a filmic reading and discussion between herself and the American elder lesbian writer. &quot;Listening for Something&quot; was being made during turbulent times as Studio D was being dismantled. Brand has also written the script and text for &quot;Under One Sky… Arab Women in North America Talk About the Hijab&quot;.

Brand&#x27;s documentary work frequently focuses on multiculturalism and sexual pluralism in Canada. She warns against state-sponsored images of multiculturalism, stating that true diversity means people having &quot;equal access to equal justice, equal jobs, equal education&quot;. Having critiqued the concept of &#x27;nation&#x27; as the notion of &quot;leaving out&quot; Black women, Brand has focused much of her work on representation for her communities.

==Critical reception==
Critics of Brand&#x27;s early work focused on Caribbean national and cultural identity and Caribbean literary theory. Barbadian poet and scholar Edward Kamau Brathwaite referred to Brand as &quot;our first major exile female poet.&quot; Academic J. Edward Chamberlain called her &quot;a final witness to the experience of migration and exile&quot; whose &quot;literary inheritance is in some genuine measure West Indian, a legacy of [Derek] Walcott, Brathwaite and others.&quot; They cite her own and others&#x27; shifting locations, both literal and theoretical.

Peter Dickinson argues that &quot;Brand &#x27;reterritorializes&#x27; … boundaries in her writing, (dis)placing or (dis)locating the national narrative of subjectivity … into the diaspora of cross-cultural, -racial, -gender, -class, and –erotic identifications.&quot; Dickinson calls these shifts in her conceptualization of national and personal affiliations &quot;the politics of location [which] cannot be separated from the politics of &#x27;production and reception.&#x27;&quot; Critic Leslie Sanders argues that, in Brand&#x27;s ongoing exploration of the notions of &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot; she uses her own &quot;statelessness&quot; as a vehicle for entering &quot;&#x27;other people&#x27;s experience&#x27;&quot; and &quot;&#x27;other places.&#x27;&quot; In Sanders&#x27; words, &quot;by becoming a Canadian writer, Brand is extending the Canadian identity in a way [Marshall] McLuhan would recognize and applaud.&quot; But, Dickinson says, &quot;Because Brand&#x27;s &#x27;here&#x27; is necessarily mediated, provisional, evanescent – in a word &#x27;unlocatable&#x27; – her work remains marginal/marginalizable in academic discussions of Canadian literary canons.&quot;

In &quot;Redefining the Subject: Sites of Play in Canadian Women&#x27;s Writing&quot;, Charlotte Sturgess suggests that Brand employs a language &quot;through which identity emerges as a mobile, thus discursive, construct.&quot; Sturgess argues that Brand&#x27;s &quot;work uses language strategically, as a wedge to split European traditions, forms and aesthetics apart; to drive them onto their own borders and contradictions&quot;. Sturgess says Brand&#x27;s work is at least two-pronged: it &quot;underline[s] the enduring ties of colonialism within contemporary society&quot;; and it &quot;investigates the very possibilities of Black, female self-representation in Canadian cultural space&quot;.

Italian academic and theorist Franca Bernabei writes in the preamble to &quot;Luce ostinata/Tenacious Light&quot; (2007), the Italian-English selected anthology of Brand&#x27;s poetry, that &quot;Brand&#x27;s poetic production reveals a remarkable variety of formal-stylistic strategies and semantic richness as well as the ongoing pursuit of a voice and a language that embody her political, affective, and aesthetic engagement with the human condition of the black woman—and, more exactly, all those oppressed by the hegemonic program of modernity.&quot; The editor and critic Constance Rooke calls Brand &quot;one of the very best [poets] in the world today&quot;, and &quot;compare[s] her to Pablo Neruda or—in fiction—to José Saramago.&quot;

The Thames Art Gallery in Chatham called Brand&#x27;s documentary &quot;Sisters in the Struggle&quot; &quot;radical in its amplifications of the voices of black Canadian women, who reflect on the legacy of the intersection of racism and sexism, alongside their personal battles in community, labour and feminist organizing&quot;.

==Activism==
In addition to being a writer, Brand is a social activist. Openly identifying as a lesbian, Brand is vocal against the discrimination of the LGBT community. She is a founder of the newspaper &quot;Our Lives&quot;, the first Canadian newspaper devoted to Black women. She is also a past chair of the Women&#x27;s Issues Committee of the Ontario Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and does work with immigrant organizations around Toronto.

<doc id="251686" wikidata="Q878640" url="?curid=251686" title="List of governors of South Dakota">
<text>The governor of South Dakota is the head of government of the U.S. state of South Dakota. The current governor is Larry Rhoden, representing the Republican Party, serving since 2025.

==Governors==

Dakota Territory was organized on March 2, 1861; on November 2, 1889, it was split into the states of North Dakota and South Dakota.

The Constitution of South Dakota originally provided for the election of a governor and lieutenant governor every two years with no limits. A law passed in 1947 prohibited parties from nominating someone who had served two consecutive terms, effectively creating a term limit, and an amendment in 1972 increased term lengths to four years while formally prohibiting someone from serving three consecutive terms. Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.

The Republican Party has been in control of the governorship continuously since 1979, Democrats last won the governorship of South Dakota in 1974. This is the longest drought of any state where the opposite party last held the office.

<text>Tevet (Hebrew: , &quot;Ṭevet&quot;; ; from Akkadian ) is the fourth month of the civil year and the tenth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. It follows Kislev and precedes Shevat. It is a month of 29 days. Tevet usually occurs in December–January on the Gregorian calendar. In the Babylonian calendar its name was Araḫ Ṭebētum, the &quot;muddy month&quot;.

==Gregorian new year==
The Gregorian New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) nearly always occurs in this month. Only rarely will it occur in either of the two neighbouring months (Kislev or Shevat).

==Holidays==
* 25 Kislev – 2 Tevet – Hanukkah (or 3 Tevet if Kislev is short)
* 10 Tevet – Tenth of Tevet (Asara beTevet), a fast day

===Community holidays===
* 5 Tevet is celebrated as a holiday by Chabad Hasidim, commemorating the 1987 verdict concerning an inheritance claim on the books of Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneersohn.

==In Jewish history and tradition==
* 1 Tevet ( 479 BC) – Esther was taken to King Achashverosh&#x27;s palace, leading to her becoming queen (Book of Esther 2:16-17).

<text>The governor of Iowa is the head of government of the U.S. state of Iowa. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the state government and is charged with enforcing state laws. The officeholder has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Iowa General Assembly, to convene the legislature, as well as to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment. The governor of Iowa is also the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces.

There have been 41 individuals who held the position of Iowa governor, with two of those serving multiple distinct terms, Samuel J. Kirkwood and Terry Branstad. The current governor, Kim Reynolds, is the first woman to hold the position and was sworn in on May 24, 2017. The longest-serving is Terry Branstad, who served from 1983 to 1999 and then again from 2011 to 2017. He is the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, surpassing the previous record of 21 years set by George Clinton of New York. The shortest-serving was Robert D. Fulton, who served 16 days.

== List of governors ==
===Territory of Iowa===

Iowa Territory was formed on July 4, 1838, from Wisconsin Territory. It had four governors appointed by the president of the United States, though the first resigned days after he was confirmed by the Senate and before ever reaching the territory. 

===State of Iowa===

The southeast portion of Iowa Territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Iowa on December 28, 1846. The first Constitution of Iowa, adopted in 1846, created the office of governor with a four-year term, with no specific start date. The 1857 constitution reduced this term to two years, but an amendment in 1972 increased this back to four years. The 1857 constitution also set the start of the term to the second Monday in the January following the election, which was moved one day later by a 1988 amendment.

The office of lieutenant governor was created in the 1857 constitution, elected for the same term as the governor. An amendment in 1988 specified that the lieutenant governor would be elected on the same ticket as the governor. If the office becomes vacant, it devolves upon the lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term or vacancy. Prior to 1857, if the office became vacant, the Secretary of State of Iowa would act as governor. There is no term limit on the number of terms a governor may serve.

<doc id="251705" wikidata="Q1401706" url="?curid=251705" title="Bargaining">
<text>In the social sciences, bargaining or haggling is a type of negotiation in which the buyer and seller of a good or service debate the price or nature of a transaction. If the bargaining produces agreement on terms, the transaction takes place. It is often commonplace in poorer countries, or poorer localities within any specific country. Haggling can mostly be seen within street markets worldwide, wherein there remains no guarantee of the origin and authenticity of available products. Many people attribute it as a skill, but there remains no guarantee that the price put forth by the buyer would be acknowledged by the seller, resulting in losses of profit and even turnover in some cases. A growth in the country&#x27;s GDP Per Capita Income is bound to reduce both the ill-effects of bargaining and the unscrupulous practices undertaken by vendors at street markets.

Although the most apparent aspect of bargaining in markets is as an alternative pricing strategy to fixed prices, it can also include making arrangements for credit or bulk purchasing, as well as serving as an important method of clienteling. 

Bargaining has largely disappeared in parts of the world where retail stores with fixed prices are the most common place to purchase goods. However, for expensive goods such as homes, antiques and collectibles, jewellery and automobiles, bargaining can remain commonplace.

Dickering and &quot;haggling&quot; refer to the same process.

== Where it takes place ==

Haggling is associated commonly with bazaars and other markets where centralized regulation is difficult or impossible. Both religious beliefs and regional custom may determine whether or not the sellers or buyers are willing to bargain.

=== Regional differences ===

In North America, Australia, and Europe, bargaining is typically confined to transactions involving expensive or one-of-a-kind items (automobiles, antiques, jewelry, art, real estate, trade sales of businesses) and informal sales settings such as flea markets and garage sales. In other regions of the world, bargaining may be the norm, even for small commercial transactions.

In Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, locals haggle for goods and services everywhere from street markets to hotels. Even children learn to haggle from a young age. Participating in that tradition can make foreigners feel accepted. On the other hand, in Thailand, haggling seems to be softer than the other countries due to Thai culture, in which people tend to be humble and avoiding of arguments. However, haggling for food items is strongly discouraged in Southeast Asia and is considered an insult, because food is seen as a common necessity that is not to be treated as a tradable good.

In almost all large complex business negotiations, a certain amount of bargaining takes place. One simplified &#x27;western&#x27; way to decide when it&#x27;s time to bargain is to break negotiation into two stages: creating value and claiming value. Claiming value is another phrase for bargaining. Many cultures take offense when they perceive the other side as having started bargaining too soon. This offense is usually as a result of their wanting to first create value for longer before they bargain together. The Chinese culture, by contrast, places a much higher value on taking time to build a business relationship before starting to create value or bargain. Not understanding when to start bargaining has ruined many an otherwise positive business negotiation.

In areas where bargaining at the retail level is common, the option to bargain often depends on the presence of the store&#x27;s owner. A chain store managed by clerks is more likely to use fixed pricing than an independent store managed by an owner or one of the owner&#x27;s trusted employees.

==Theories==
===Behavioral theory===
The personality theory in bargaining emphasizes that the type of personalities determine the bargaining process and its outcome. A popular behavioral theory deals with a distinction between hard-liners and soft-liners. Various research papers refer to hard-liners as warriors, while soft-liners are shopkeepers. It varies from region to region. Bargaining may take place more in rural and semi-urban areas than in a metro city.

===Game theory===
Bargaining games refer to situations where two or more players must reach an agreement regarding how to distribute an object or monetary amount. Each player prefers to reach an agreement in these games, rather than abstain from doing so. However, each prefers that the agreement favor their interests. Examples of such situations include the bargaining involved in a labor union and the directors of a company negotiating wage increases, the dispute between two communities about the distribution of a common territory, or the conditions under which two countries agree on nuclear disarmament. Analyzing these kinds of problems looks for a solution that specifies which component in dispute corresponds to each party involved.
Players in a bargaining problem can bargain for the objective as a whole at a precise moment in time. The problem can also be divided so that parts of the whole objective become subject to bargaining during different stages.

In a classical bargaining problem, the result is an agreement reached between all interested parties or the status quo of the problem. It is clear that studying how individual parties make their decisions is insufficient for predicting what agreement will be reached. However, classical bargaining theory assumes that each participant in a bargaining process will choose between possible agreements, following the conduct predicted by the rational choice model. It is particularly assumed that each player&#x27;s preferences regarding the possible agreements can be represented by a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem function.

Nash [1950] defines a classical bargaining problem as being a set of joint allocations of utility, some of which correspond to what the players would obtain if they reach an agreement, and another that represents what they would get if they failed to do so.

A bargaining game for two players is defined as a pair (F,d) where F is the set of possible joint utility allocations (possible agreements), and &quot;d&quot; is the disagreement point.

For the definition of a specific bargaining solution, it is usual to follow Nash&#x27;s proposal, setting out the axioms this solution should satisfy. Some of the most frequent axioms used in the building of bargaining solutions are efficiency, symmetry, independence of irrelevant alternatives, scalar invariance, monotonicity, etc.

The Nash bargaining solution is the bargaining solution that maximizes the product of an agent&#x27;s utilities on the bargaining set.

The Nash bargaining solution, however, only deals with the simplest structure of bargaining. It is not dynamic (failing to deal with how Pareto outcomes are achieved). Instead, for situations where the structure of the bargaining game is important, a more mainstream game-theoretic approach is useful. This can allow players&#x27; preferences over time and risk to be incorporated into the solution of bargaining games. It can also show how the details can matter. For example, the Nash bargaining solution for the prisoners&#x27; dilemma is different from the Nash equilibrium.

===Bargaining and posted prices in retail markets===

Retailers can choose to sell at posted prices or allow bargaining: selling at a public posted price commits the retailer not to exploit buyers once they enter the retail store, making the store more attractive to potential customers, while a bargaining strategy has the advantage that it allows the retailer to price discriminate between different types of customer. In some markets, such as those for automobiles and expensive electronic goods, firms post prices but are open to haggling with consumers. When the proportion of haggling consumers goes up, prices tend to rise.

===Processual theory===
This theory isolates distinctive elements of the bargaining chronology in order to better understand the complexity of the negotiating process. Several key features of the processual theory include:
*Bargaining range
*Critical risk
*Security point

===Integrative theory===
Integrative bargaining (also called &quot;interest-based bargaining,&quot; &quot;win-win bargaining&quot;) is a negotiation strategy in which parties collaborate to find a &quot;win-win&quot; solution to their dispute. This strategy focuses on developing mutually beneficial agreements based on the interests of the disputants. Interests include the needs, desires, concerns, and fears important to each side. They are the underlying reasons why people become involved in a conflict.

&quot;Integrative refers to the potential for the parties&#x27; interests to be [combined] in ways that create joint value or enlarge the pie.&quot; Potential for integration only exists when there are multiple issues involved in the negotiation. This is because the parties must be able to make trade-offs across issues in order for both sides to be satisfied with the outcome.

=== Automated bargaining ===
When a bargaining situation is complex, finding Nash equilibrium is difficult using game theory. Evolutionary computation methods have been designed for automated bargaining, and demonstrated efficient and effective for approximating Nash equilibrium.

<text>Darwin Mounds is a large field of undersea sand mounds situated off the north west coast of Scotland that were first discovered in May 1998. They provide a unique habitat for ancient deep water coral reefs and were found using remote sensing techniques during surveys funded by the oil industry and steered by the joint industry and United Kingdom government group the Atlantic Frontier Environment Network (AFEN) (Masson and Jacobs 1998). The mounds were named after the research vessel, itself named for the eminent naturalist and evolutionary theorist Charles Darwin.

The mounds are about below the surface of the North Atlantic ocean, approximately north-west of Cape Wrath, the north-west tip of mainland Scotland. There are hundreds of mounds in the field, which in total cover approximately . Individual mounds are typically circular, up to high and wide. Most of the mounds are also distinguished by the presence of an additional feature referred to as a &#x27;tail&#x27;. The tails are of a variable extent and may merge with others, but are generally a teardrop shape and are orientated south-west of the mound. The mound-tail feature of the Darwin Mounds is apparently unique globally.

==Composition==
The mounds are mostly sand, currently interpreted as &quot;sand volcanoes&quot;. These features are caused when fluidised sand &quot;de-waters&quot; and the fluid bubbles up through the sand, pushing the sediment up into a cone shape. Sand volcanoes are common in the Devonian fossil record in UK, and in seismically active areas of the planet. In this case, tectonic activity is unlikely; some form of slumping on the south-west side of the undersea (Wyville-Thomson) Ridge being a more likely cause. The tops of the mounds have living stands of Lophelia and blocky rubble (interpreted as coral debris). The mounds provide one of the largest known northerly cold-water habitats for coral species. The mounds are also unusual in that Lophelia pertusa, a cold water coral, appears to be growing on sand rather than a hard substratum. Prior to research on the mounds in 2000, it was thought that Lophelia required a hard substratum for attachment.

The deep-water coral systems on the mounds are especially fragile. Unlike shallow-water coral reefs, they are not adapted to cope with minor disturbances such as wave action. The mounds also support significant populations of the xenophyophore &quot;Syringammina fragilissima&quot;. This is a giant single-celled organism (a protozoan) that is widespread in deep waters, but occurs in particularly high densities on the mounds and the tails. Individual xenophyophores can grow to be larger than and are often very fragile. The corals themselves provide a habitat for a wide diversity of other marine life including sponges, worms, crustaceans and molluscs. Among these starfish, sea urchins and crabs. Various fish have been observed, including blue ling, roundnose grenadier, and the orange roughy.

==Conservation efforts==
On 23 October 2001, UK Minister Margaret Beckett made a commitment at WWF&#x27;s Oceans Recovery Summit in Edinburgh to protect the Darwin Mounds. The summit launched the Edinburgh Declaration, targeting politicians and marine stakeholders alike to sign up to action to safeguard the seas. Deep water bottom trawling had been occurring in the area, with nets as heavy as one tonne dragged across the sea floor. Researcher Jason Hall-Spencer of the University of Glasgow had found pieces of coral at least 4,500 years old in the nets of trawlers operating off the coast of Ireland and Scotland. Pieces of coral up to were found in the nets of French trawling vessels that had been scraping the seabed down. It is known that much coral was destroyed by these nets and the mounds themselves in some areas were found to be scraped and flattened. The mounds are ancient structures, and this damage is permanent.

After the discovery of the mounds, three well-documented surveys of the area were undertaken, one in June 1998 (Bett 1999), August 1999 (Bett &amp; Jacobs 2000,) and twice during summer 2000 (B. Bett, pers. comm.). Instruments deployed during the studies included side-scan sonar, stills and video cameras and piston corers. However, the entirety of what was lost to heavy-netted fishing trawlers remains unknown. On 22 March 2004 EU Fisheries Ministers in Brussels agreed to give permanent protection to the United Kingdom&#x27;s unique cold-water coral reefs, recognising the Darwin Mounds as an important habitat. In 2004 deep-water bottom trawling in the area was made illegal.

<doc id="251713" wikidata="Q175047" url="?curid=251713" title="Qibla">
<text>The qibla () is the direction towards the Kaaba in the Sacred Mosque in Mecca, which is used by Muslims in various religious contexts, particularly the direction of prayer for the salah. In Islam, the Kaaba is believed to be a sacred site built by prophets Abraham and Ishmael, and that its use as the qibla was ordained by God in several verses of the Quran revealed to Muhammad in the second Hijri year. Prior to this revelation, Muhammad and his followers in Medina faced Jerusalem for prayers. Most mosques contain a (a wall niche) that indicates the direction of the qibla.

The qibla is also the direction for entering the (sacred state for the hajj pilgrimage); the direction to which animals are turned during (Islamic slaughter); the recommended direction to make (supplications); the direction to avoid when relieving oneself or spitting; and the direction to which the deceased are aligned when buried. The qibla may be observed facing the Kaaba accurately () or facing in the general direction (). Most Islamic scholars consider that is acceptable if the more precise cannot be ascertained.

The most common technical definition used by Muslim astronomers for a location is the direction on the great circle—in the Earth&#x27;s Sphere—passing through the location and the Kaaba. This is the direction of the shortest possible path from a place to the Kaaba, and allows the exact calculation () of the qibla using a spherical trigonometric formula that takes the coordinates of a location and of the Kaaba as inputs (see formula below). The method is applied to develop mobile applications and websites for Muslims, and to compile qibla tables used in instruments such as the qibla compass. The qibla can also be determined at a location by observing the shadow of a vertical rod on the twice-yearly occasions when the Sun is directly overhead in Mecca—on 27 and 28 May at 12:18 Saudi Arabia Standard Time (09:18 UTC), and on 15 and 16 July at 12:27 SAST (09:27 UTC).

Before the development of astronomy in the Islamic world, Muslims used traditional methods to determine the qibla. These methods included facing the direction that the companions of Muhammad had used when in the same place; using the setting and rising points of celestial objects; using the direction of the wind; or using due south, which was Muhammad&#x27;s qibla in Medina. Early Islamic astronomy was built on its Indian and Greek counterparts, especially the works of Ptolemy, and soon Muslim astronomers developed methods to calculate the approximate directions of the qibla, starting from the mid-9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, Muslim astronomers developed methods to find the exact direction of the qibla which are equivalent to the modern formula. Initially, this &quot;qibla of the astronomers&quot; was used alongside various traditionally determined qiblas, resulting in much diversity in medieval Muslim cities. In addition, the accurate geographic data necessary for the astronomical methods to yield an accurate result was not available before the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in further diversity of the qibla. Historical mosques with differing qiblas still stand today throughout the Islamic world. The spaceflight of a devout Muslim, Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor, to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2007 generated a discussion with regard to the qibla direction from low Earth orbit, prompting the Islamic authority of his home country, Malaysia, to recommend determining the qibla &quot;based on what is possible&quot; for the astronaut.

== Location ==


The qibla is the direction of the Kaaba, a cube-like building at the centre of the Sacred Mosque (&quot;&quot;) in Mecca, in the Hijaz region of Saudi Arabia. Other than its role as qibla, it is also the holiest site for Muslims, also known as the House of God () and where the (the circumambulation ritual) is performed during the Hajj and umrah pilgrimages. The Kaaba has an approximately rectangular ground plan with its four corners pointing close to the four cardinal directions. According to the Quran, it was built by Abraham and Ishmael, both of whom are prophets in Islam. Few historical records remain detailing the history of the Kaaba before the rise of Islam, but in the generations prior to Muhammad, the Kaaba had been used as a shrine of the pre-Islamic Arabic religion.

The qibla status of the Kaaba (or the Sacred Mosque in which it is located) is based on the verses 144, 149, and 150 of the al-Baqarah chapter of the Quran, each of which contains a command to &quot;turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque&quot; (). According to Islamic traditions, these verses were revealed in the month of Rajab or Sha&#x27;ban in the second Hijri year (623 CE), or about 15 or 16 months after Muhammad&#x27;s migration to Medina. Prior to these revelations, Muhammad and the Muslims in Medina had prayed towards Jerusalem as the qibla, the same direction as the prayer direction—the —used by the Jews of Medina. Islamic tradition says that these verses were revealed during a prayer congregation; Muhammad and his followers immediately changed their direction from Jerusalem to Mecca in the middle of the prayer ritual. The location of this event became the Masjid al-Qiblatayn (&quot;The Mosque of the Two Qiblas&quot;).

There are different reports of the qibla direction when Muhammad was in Mecca (before his migration to Medina). According to a report cited by historian al-Tabari and exegete (textual interpreter) al-Baydawi, Muhammad prayed towards the Kaaba. Another report, cited by al-Baladhuri and also by al-Tabari, says that Muhammad prayed towards Jerusalem while in Mecca. Another report, mentioned in Ibn Hisham&#x27;s biography of Muhammad, says that Muhammad prayed in such a way as to face the Kaaba and Jerusalem simultaneously. Today Muslims of all branches, including the Sunni and the Shia, all pray towards the Kaaba. Historically, one major exception was the Qarmatians, a now-defunct syncretic Shia sect which rejected the Kaaba as the qibla; in 930, they sacked Mecca and for a time took the Kaaba&#x27;s Black Stone to their centre of power in al-Ahsa, with the intention of starting a new era in Islam.

== Religious significance ==

Etymologically, the Arabic word () means &quot;direction&quot;. In Islamic ritual and law, it refers to a special direction faced by Muslims during prayers and other religious contexts. Islamic religious scholars agree that facing the qibla is a necessary condition for the validity of salah—the Islamic ritual prayer—in normal conditions; exceptions include prayers during a state of fear or war, as well as non-obligatory prayers during travel. The hadith (Muhammad&#x27;s tradition) also prescribes that Muslims face the qibla when entering the (sacred state for hajj), after the middle (stone-throwing ritual) during the pilgrimage. Islamic etiquette () calls for Muslims to turn the head of an animal when it is slaughtered, and the faces of the dead when they are buried, toward the qibla. The qibla is the preferred direction when making a supplication and is to be avoided when defecating, urinating, and spitting.

Inside a mosque, the qibla is usually indicated by a , a niche in its qibla-facing wall. In a congregational prayer, the imam stands in it or close to it, in front of the rest of the congregation. The became a part of the mosque during the Umayyad period and its form was standardised during the Abbasid period; before that, the qibla of a mosque was known from the orientation of one of its walls, called the qibla wall. The term &#x27; itself is attested only once in the Quran, but it refers to a place of prayer of the Israelites rather than a part of a mosque. The Amr ibn al-As Mosque in Fustat, Egypt, one of the oldest mosques, is known to have been built originally without a &#x27;, though one has since been added.

=== &#x27; and &#x27; ===

 (&quot;standing so as to face the Kaaba head-on&quot;) is a position facing the qibla so that an imaginary line extending from the person&#x27;s line of sight would pass through the Kaaba. This manner of observing the qibla is easily done inside the Great Mosque of Mecca and its surroundings, but given that the Kaaba is less than wide, this is virtually impossible from distant locations. For example, from Medina, with a straight-line distance from the Kaaba, a one-degree deviation from the precise imaginary line—an error hardly noticeable when setting one&#x27;s prayer mat or assuming one&#x27;s posture—results in a shift from the site of the Kaaba. This effect is amplified when further than Mecca: from Jakarta, Indonesia—some away, a one-degree deviation causes more than a shift, and even an arc second&#x27;s deviation——causes a more than shift from the location of the Kaaba. In comparison, the construction process of a mosque can easily introduce an error of up to five degrees from the calculated qibla, and the installation of prayer rugs inside the mosque as indicators for worshipers can add another deviation of five degrees from the mosque&#x27;s orientation.

A minority of Islamic religious scholars—for example Ibn Arabi ()—consider &#x27; to be obligatory during the ritual prayer, while others consider it obligatory only when one is able. For locations further than Mecca, scholars such as Abu Hanifa () and Al-Qurtubi () argue that it is permissible to assume , facing only the general direction of the Kaaba. Others argue that the ritual condition of facing the qibla is already fulfilled when the imaginary line to the Kaaba is within one&#x27;s field of vision. For instance, there are legal opinions that accept the entire southeastern quadrant in Al-Andalus (Islamic Iberian Peninsula), and the southwestern quadrant in Central Asia, to be valid qibla. Arguments for the validity of &#x27; include the wording of the Quran, which commands Muslims only to &quot;turn [one&#x27;s] face&quot; toward the Great Mosque, and to avoid imposing requirements that would be impossible to fulfill if &#x27; were to be obligatory in all places. The Shafi&#x27;i school of Islamic law, as codified in Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi&#x27;s 11th-century &#x27;, argues that one must follow the qibla indicated by the local mosque when one is not near Mecca or, when not near a mosque, to ask a trustworthy person. When this is not possible, one is to make one&#x27;s own determination—to exercise —by the means at one&#x27;s disposal.

== Determination ==
=== Theoretical basis: the great circle ===

A great circle, also called the orthodrome, is any circle on a sphere whose centre is identical to the centre of the sphere. For example, all lines of longitude are great circles of the Earth, while the equator is the only line of latitude that is also a great circle (other lines of latitude are centered north or south of the centre of the Earth). The great circle is the theoretical basis in most models that seek to mathematically determine the direction of the qibla from a locality. In such models, the qibla is defined as the direction of the great circle passing through the locality and the Kaaba. One of the properties of a great circle is that it indicates the shortest path connecting any pair of points along the circle—this is the basis of its use to determine the qibla. The great circle is similarly used to find the shortest flight path connecting the two locations—therefore the qibla calculated using the great circle method is generally close to the direction of the locality to Mecca. As the ellipsoid is a more accurate figure of the Earth than a perfect sphere, modern researchers have looked into using ellipsoidal models to calculate the qibla, replacing the great circle by the geodesics on an ellipsoid. This results in more complicated calculations, while the improvement in accuracy falls well within the typical precision of the setting out of a mosque or the placement of a mat. For example, calculations using the GRS 80 ellipsoidal model yields the qibla of 18°47′06″ for a location in San Francisco, while the great circle method yields 18°51′05″.

=== Calculations with spherical trigonometry ===

The great circle model is applied to calculate the qibla using spherical trigonometry—a branch of geometry that deals with the mathematical relations between the sides and angles of triangles formed by three great circles of a sphere (as opposed to the conventional trigonometry which deals with those of a two-dimensional triangle).

If a location formula_1, the Kaaba formula_2, and the north pole formula_3 form a triangle on the sphere of the Earth, then the qibla is indicated by formula_4, which is the direction of the great circle passing through both formula_1 and formula_2. The qibla can also be expressed as an angle, formula_7 (or formula_8), of the qibla with respect to the north, also called the &quot;inhiraf al-qibla&quot;. This angle can be calculated as a mathematical function of the local latitude formula_9, the latitude of the Kaaba formula_10, and the longitude difference between the locality and the Kaaba formula_11. This function is derived from the cotangent rule which applies to any spherical triangle with angles formula_12, formula_13, formula_14 and sides formula_15, formula_16, formula_17:


Applying this formula in the spherical triangle formula_18 (substituting formula_19) and applying trigonometric identities obtain:


This formula was derived by modern scholars, but equivalent methods have been known to Muslim astronomers since the 9th century (3rd century ), developed by various scholars, including Habash al-Hasib (active in Damascus and Baghdad ), Al-Nayrizi (Baghdad, ), Ibn Yunus (10th–11th century), Ibn al-Haytham (11th century), and Al-Biruni (11th century). Today spherical trigonometry also underlies nearly all applications or websites which calculate the qibla.

When the qibla angle with respect to the north, formula_8, is known, true north needs to be known to find the qibla in practice. Common practical methods to find it include the observation of the shadow at the culmination of the sun—when the sun crosses exactly the local meridian. At this point, any vertical object would cast a shadow oriented in the north–south direction. The result of this observation is very accurate, but it requires an accurate determination of the local time of culmination as well as making the correct observation at that exact moment. Another common method is using the compass, which is more practical because it can be done at any time; the disadvantage is that the north indicated by a magnetic compass differs from true north. This magnetic declination can measure up to 20°, which can vary in different places on Earth and changes over time.

=== Shadow observation ===

As observed from Earth, the Sun appears to &quot;shift&quot; between the Northern and Southern Tropics seasonally; additionally, it appears to move from east to west daily as a consequence of the Earth&#x27;s rotation. The combination of these two apparent motions means that every day the Sun crosses the meridian once, usually not precisely overhead but to the north or to the south of the observer. In locations between the two tropics—latitudes lower than 23.5° north or south—at certain moments of the year (usually twice a year) the Sun passes almost directly overhead. This happens when the Sun crosses the meridian while being at the local latitude at the same time.

The city of Mecca is among the places where this occurs, due to its location at 21°25′ N. It occurs twice a year, firstly on 27/28 May at about 12:18 Saudi Arabia Standard Time (SAST) or 09:18 UTC, and secondly on 15/16 July at 12:27 SAST (09:27 UTC). As the sun reaches the zenith of the Kaaba, any vertical object on earth that receives sunlight cast a shadow that indicates the qibla (&quot;see picture&quot;). This method of finding the qibla is called (&quot;observing the qibla&quot;). Since night falls on the hemisphere opposite of the Kaaba, half the locations on Earth (including Australia as well as most of the Americas and the Pacific Ocean) cannot observe this directly. Instead, such places observe the opposite phenomenon when the Sun passes above the antipodal point of the Kaaba (in other words, the Sun passes directly underneath the Kaaba), causing shadows in the opposite direction from those observed during &#x27;. This occurs twice a year, on 14 January 00:30 SAST (21:30 UTC the previous day) and 29 November 00:09 SAST (21:09 UTC the previous day). Observations made within five minutes of the &#x27; moments or its antipodal counterparts, or at the same time of the day two days before or after each event, still show accurate directions with negligible difference.

=== On the world map ===

Spherical trigonometry provides the shortest path from any point on Earth to the Kaaba, even though the indicated direction might seem counterintuitive when imagined on a flat world map. For example, the qibla from Alaska obtained through spherical trigonometry is almost due north. This apparent counter-intuitiveness is caused by projections used by world maps, which by necessity distort the surface of the Earth. A straight line shown by the world map in using the Mercator projection is called the rhumb line or the loxodrome, which is used to indicate the qibla by a minority of Muslims. It can result in a dramatic difference in some places; for example, in some parts of North America the flat map shows Mecca in the southeast while the great circle calculation shows it to the northeast. In Japan the map shows it to the southwest, while the great circle shows it to the northwest. The majority of Muslims, however, follow the great circle method.

A retroazimuthal projection is any map projection which preserves the angular direction (the azimuth) of the great circle path from any point of the map to a point selected as the center of the map. The initial purpose of its development was to help finding the qibla, by choosing the Kaaba as the center point. The earliest surviving works using this projection were two astrolabe-shaped brass instruments created in 18th-century Iran. They contain grids covering locations between Spain and China, label the locations of major cities along with their names, but do not show any coastline. The first of the two was discovered in 1989; its diameter is and it has a ruler with which one can read the direction of Mecca from the markings on the instrument&#x27;s circumference, and the distance to Mecca from the markings on the ruler. Only the second one is signed by its creator, Muhammad Husayn. The first formal design of a retroazimuthal projection in the Western literature is the Craig projection or the Mecca projection, created by the Scottish mathematician James Ireland Craig, who worked at the Survey Department of Egypt, in 1910. His map is centered in Mecca and its range is limited to show the predominantly Muslim lands. Extending the map further than 90° in longitude from the center will result in crowding and overlaps.

=== Traditional methods ===

Historical records and surviving old mosques show that throughout history the qibla was often determined by simple methods based on tradition or &quot;folk science&quot; not based on mathematical astronomy. Some early Muslims used due south everywhere as the qibla, literally following Muhammad&#x27;s instruction to face south while he was in Medina (Mecca is due south of Medina). Some mosques as far away as al-Andalus to the west and Central Asia to the east face south, even though Mecca is nowhere near that direction. In various places, there are also the &quot;qiblas of the companions&quot; (), those which were used there by the Companions of the Prophet—the first generation of Muslims, who are considered role models in Islam. Such directions were used by some Muslims in the following centuries, side by side with other directions, even after Muslim astronomers used calculations to find more accurate directions to Mecca. Among the directions described as the qiblas of the companions are due south in Syria and Palestine, the direction of the winter sunrise in Egypt, and the direction of the winter sunset in Iraq. The direction of the winter sunrise and sunset are also traditionally favoured because they are parallel to the walls of the Kaaba.

== Development of methods ==
=== Pre-astronomy ===

The determination of qibla has been an important problem for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques. When Muhammad lived among the Muslims in Medina (which, like Mecca, is also in the Hejaz region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of Mecca. Within the few generations after Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, Muslims had reached places far away from Mecca, presenting the problem of determining the qibla in new locations. Mathematical methods based on astronomy would develop only at the end of the 8th century or the beginning of the 9th, and even then they were not initially popular. Therefore, early Muslims relied on non-astronomical methods.

There was a wide range of traditional methods in determining the qibla during the early Islamic period, resulting in different directions even from the same place. In addition to due south and the qiblas of the companions, the Arabs also knew a form of &quot;folk&quot; astronomy—called so by the historian of astronomy David A. King to distinguish it from conventional astronomy, which is an exact science—originating from pre-Islamic traditions. It used natural phenomenon, including the observation of the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and wind, without any basis in mathematics. These methods yield specific directions in individual localities, often using the fixed setting and rising points of a specific star, the sunrise or sunset at the equinoxes, or at the summer or the winter solstices. Historical sources record several such qiblas, for example: sunrise at the equinoxes (due east) in the Maghreb, sunset at the equinoxes (due west) in India, the origin of the north wind or the fixed location of the North Star in Yemen, the rising point of the star (Canopus) in Syria, and the midwinter sunset in Iraq. Such directions appear in texts of (Islamic jurisprudence) and texts of folk astronomy. Astronomers (aside from folk astronomers) typically do not comment on these methods, but they were not opposed by Islamic legal scholars. The traditional directions were still in use when methods were developed to calculate the qibla more accurately, and they still appear in some surviving medieval mosques today.

=== With astronomy ===

The study of astronomy—known as (&quot;science of the celestial orbs&quot;) in the Islamic intellectual tradition—began to appear in the Islamic World in the second half of the 8th century, centred in Baghdad, the principal city of the Abbasid Caliphate. Initially, the science was introduced through the works of Indian authors, but after the 9th century the works of Greek astronomers such as Ptolemy were translated into Arabic and became the main references in the field. Muslim astronomers preferred Greek astronomy because they considered it to be better supported by theoretical explanations and therefore it could be developed as an exact science; however, the influence of Indian astronomy survives especially in the compilation of astronomical tables. This new science was applied to develop new methods of determining the qibla, making use of the concept of latitude and longitude taken from Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; as well as trigonometric formulae developed by Muslim scholars. Most textbooks of astronomy written in the medieval Islamic World contain a chapter on the determination of the qibla, considered one of the many things connecting astronomy with Islamic law (sharia). According to David A. King, various medieval solutions for the determination of the qibla &quot;bear witness to the development of mathematical methods from the 3rd/9th to the 8th/14th centuries and to the level of sophistication in trigonometry and computational techniques attained by these scholars&quot;.

The first mathematical methods developed in the early 9th century were approximate solutions to the mathematical problem, usually using a flat map or two-dimensional geometry. Since in reality the Earth is spherical, the directions found were inexact, but they were sufficient for locations relatively close to Mecca (including as far away as Egypt and Iran) because the errors were less than 2°.

Exact solutions, based on three-dimensional geometry and spherical trigonometry, began to appear in the mid-9th century. Habash al-Hasib wrote an early example, using an orthographic projection. Another group of solutions uses trigonometric formulas, for example Al-Nayrizi&#x27;s four-step application of Menelaus&#x27;s theorem. Subsequent scholars, including Ibn Yunus, Abu al-Wafa, Ibn al-Haitham and Al-Biruni, proposed other methods which are confirmed to be accurate from the viewpoint of modern astronomy.

Muslim astronomers subsequently used these methods to compile tables showing the qibla from a list of locations, grouped by their latitude and longitude differences from Mecca. The oldest known example, from Baghdad, contained entries for each degree and arc minute up to 20°. In the 14th century, Shams al-Din al-Khalili, an astronomer who served as a (timekeeper) in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, compiled a qibla table for 2,880 coordinates with longitude differences of up to 60° from Mecca, and with latitudes ranging from 10° to 50°. King opines that among the medieval qibla tables, al-Khalili&#x27;s work is &quot;the most impressive from the view of its scope and its accuracy&quot;.

The accuracy of applying these methods to actual locations depend on the accuracy of its input parameters—the local latitude and the latitude of Mecca, and the longitude difference. At the time of the development of these methods, the latitude of a location could be determined to several arc minutes&#x27; accuracy, but there was no accurate method to determine a location&#x27;s longitude. Common methods used to estimate the longitude difference included comparing the local timing of a lunar eclipse versus the timing in Mecca, or measuring the distance of caravan routes; the Central Asian scholar Al-Biruni made his estimate by averaging various approximate methods. Because of longitudinal inaccuracy, medieval qibla calculations (including those using mathematically accurate methods) differ from the modern values. For example, while the Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo was built using the &quot;qibla of the astronomers&quot;, but the mosque&#x27;s qibla (127°) differs somewhat from the results of modern calculations (135°) because the longitude difference used was off by three degrees.

Accurate longitude values in the Islamic world were available only after the application of cartographic surveys in the 18th and 19th centuries. Modern coordinates, along with new technologies such as GPS satellites and electronic instruments, resulted in the development of practical instruments to calculate the qibla. The qibla found using modern instruments might differ from the direction of mosques, because a mosque might be built before the advent of modern data, and orientation inaccuracies might have been introduced during the building process of modern mosques. When this is known, sometimes the direction of the mosque&#x27;s &quot;mihrab&quot; is still observed, and sometimes a marker is added (such as lines drawn in the mosque) that can be followed instead of the &quot;mihrab&quot;.

== Instruments ==

Muslims use various instruments to find the qibla direction when not near a mosque. The qibla compass is a magnetic compass which includes a table or a list of qibla angles from major settlements. Some electronic versions use satellite coordinates to calculate and indicate the qibla automatically. Qibla compasses have existed since around 1300, supplemented by the list of qibla angles often written on the instruments themselves. Hotel rooms with Muslim guests may use a sticker showing the qibla on the ceiling or a drawer. With the advent of computing, various mobile apps and websites use formulae to calculate the qibla for their users.

== Diversity ==
=== Early Islamic world ===

Because varying methods have been used to determine the qibla, mosques were built throughout history in different directions, including some that still stand today. Methods based on astronomy and mathematics were not always used, and the same determination method could yield different qiblas due to differences in the accuracy of data and calculations. Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi (d. 1442) recorded various qibla angles used in Cairo at the time: 90° (due east), 117° (winter sunrise, the &quot;qibla of the sahaba&quot;), 127° (calculated by astronomers, such as Ibn Yunus), 141° (Mosque of Ibn Tulun), 156° (the rising point of Suhayl/Canopus), 180° (due south, emulating the qibla of Muhammad in Medina), and 204° (the setting point of Canopus). The modern qibla for Cairo is 135°, which was not known at the time. This diversity also results in the non-uniform layout in Cairo&#x27;s districts, because the streets are often oriented according to the varying orientation of the mosques. Historical records also indicate the diversity of qiblas in other major cities, including Córdoba (113°, 120°, 135°, 150°, and 180° were recorded in the 12th century) and Samarkand (180°, 225°, 230°, 240°, and 270° were recorded in the 11th century). According to the doctrine of , the diverse directions of qiblas are still valid as long as they are still in the same broad direction.

In 1990, the scholar of geography Michael E. Bonine conducted a survey of the main mosques of all major cities in present-day Morocco—constructed from the Idrisid period (8th–10th centuries) up to the Alawi period (17th century to present). While modern calculations yield the qiblas of between 91° (almost due east) in Marrakesh and 97° in Tangier, only mosques constructed in the Alaouite period are constructed with qiblas relatively close to this range. The qibla of older mosques vary considerably, with concentrations occurring between 155°–160° (slightly east of south) as well as 120°–130° (almost southeast). In 2008, Bonine also published a survey of the main city mosques of Tunisia, in which he found that most were aligned close to 147°. This is the direction of the Great Mosque of Kairouan, originally built in 670 and last rebuilt by the Aghlabids in 862, which is often credited as the model used by the other mosques. Among the mosques surveyed, the Great Mosque of Sousse was the only one with a significant difference, facing further south at 163°. The actual direction to Mecca as calculated using the great circle method ranges from 110° to 113° throughout the country.

=== Indonesia ===

Variations of the qibla also occur in Indonesia, the country with the world&#x27;s largest Muslim population. The astronomically calculated qibla ranges from 291°—295° (21°—25° north of west) depending on the exact location in the archipelago. However, the qibla is often known traditionally simply as &quot;the west&quot;, resulting in mosques built oriented due west or to the direction of sunset—which varies slightly throughout the year. Different opinions exist among Indonesian Islamic astronomers: Tono Saksono &quot;et al.&quot; argues in 2018 that facing the qibla during prayers is more of a &quot;spiritual prerequisite&quot; than a precise physical one, and that an exact direction to the Kaaba itself from thousands of kilometres away requires an extreme precision impossible to achieve when building a mosque or when standing for prayers. On the other hand, Muhammad Hadi Bashori in 2014 opines that &quot;correcting the qibla is indeed a very urgent thing&quot;, and can be guided by simple methods such as observing the shadow.

In the history of the region, disputes about the qibla had also occurred in the then-Dutch East Indies in the 1890s. When the Indonesian scholar and future founder of Muhammadiyah, Ahmad Dahlan, returned from his Islamic and astronomy studies in Mecca, he found that mosques in the royal capital of Yogyakarta had inaccurate qiblas, including the Kauman Great Mosque, which faced due west. His efforts in adjusting the qibla were opposed by the traditional &quot;ulama&quot; of the Yogyakarta Sultanate, and a new mosque built by Dahlan using his calculations was demolished by a mob. Dahlan rebuilt his mosque in the 1900s, and later the Kauman Great Mosque would also be reoriented using the astronomically calculated qibla.

=== North America ===

For locations outside of historic Muslim communities, determination of the qibla can be a matter of debate. The Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. was built in 1953 facing slightly north of east and initially puzzled some observers, including Muslims, because Washington, D.C.&#x27;s latitude is 17°30′ north of Mecca. Even though a line drawn on world maps—such as those using the Mercator projection—would suggest a southeastern direction to Mecca, the astronomical calculation using the great circle method does yield a north-of-east direction (56°33′). Nevertheless, most early mosques in the United States face east or southeast, following the apparent direction on world maps. In 1978, an American Muslim scientist, S. Kamal Abdali, wrote a book arguing that the correct qibla from North America was north or northeast as calculated by the great circle method which identifies the shortest path to Mecca. This conclusion was widely circulated and then accepted by the Muslim community, and mosques were subsequently reoriented as a result. In 1993, two religious scholars, Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi, published a book arguing for a southeastern qibla, writing that the north/northeast qibla was invalid and resulted from a lack of religious knowledge. In reaction, Abdali published a response to their arguments and criticism in an article entitled &quot;The Correct Qibla&quot; online in 1997. The two opinions resulted in a period of debate about the correct qibla. Eventually most North American Muslims accepted the north/northeast qibla with a minority following the east/southeast qibla.

=== Space and ISS ===


The International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth at high speed—the direction from it to Mecca changes significantly within a few seconds. Before his flight to the ISS, Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor requested, and the Malaysian National Fatwa Council provided, guidelines which have been translated into multiple languages. The council wrote that the qibla determination should be &quot;based on what is possible&quot; and recommended four options, saying that one should pray toward the first option if possible and, if not, fall back successively on the later ones:
# the Kaaba itself
# the position directly above the Kaaba at the altitude of the astronaut&#x27;s orbit
# the Earth in general
# &quot;wherever&quot;

In line with the fatwa council, other Muslim scholars argue for the importance of flexibility and adapting the qibla requirement to what an astronaut is capable of fulfilling. Khaleel Muhammad of San Diego State University opined &quot;God does not take a person to task for that which is beyond his/her ability to work with.&quot; Kamal Abdali argued that concentration during a prayer is more important than the exact orientation, and he suggested keeping the qibla direction at the start of a prayer instead of &quot;worrying about possible changes in position&quot;. Before Sheikh Muszaphar&#x27;s mission, at least eight Muslims had flown to space, but none of them publicly discussed issues relating to worship in space.

<text>In human sexuality, a sex life is a sector of a person&#x27;s day-to-day existence which may involve sexual activity or represent the absence of sexual activity. In general parlance, the term can have many sub-meanings and social layers, but generally includes the following:

* The individual is able to, on an either regular or semi-regular basis, enter into voluntarily agreed and consensual situations involving partnered sexual activity, i.e. an activity other than &quot;solo&quot; masturbation. This would inherently mean there is at least one other person per situation, with or without sexual activity, and regardless of whether or not these situations are sexually monogamous; i.e., a &quot;sex life&quot; can be had just as easily with a long-term sexual partner as it can with multiple partners in rapid succession over a lifetime. The idea of a &#x27;regularly or semi-regularly&#x27; sex life varies, but categorizing an individual who is involuntarily celibate (as opposed to voluntary abstinence) as having a sex life may be inaccurate.
* Presuming the above is true by default, the individual who has a sex life is then able to explore and deepen their existing sexual skills and also, when they desire it, is able to have the opportunity to learn new ones and to &quot;grow&quot; as a sexual being.
* The individual is able, because of these factors, to have an &quot;area&quot; of their overall &quot;life&quot; that involves sex in a way that is somewhat similar to how athletes have an &quot;area&quot; of their lives that involves sports or how musicians have an &quot;area&quot; of their lives that involves music. A person with a secure and constantly developing sex life is inherently able to regard their sexuality as an active part of themselves, and although a secure sex life does not necessarily mean that the person will always feel self-confident or sexually attractive, consistent access to sex and the ability to deepen and broaden one&#x27;s sexual skills provides a certain psychological assurance of sex appeal that people who do not have a &quot;sex life&quot; tend not to have.

==Sex frequency==
Several sources say that in humans, frequency of sexual intercourse might range from 0 to 20 times a week. In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week. It is generally recognized that postmenopausal women experience declines in frequency of sexual intercourse and that average frequency of intercourse declines with age. According to the Kinsey Institute, average frequency of sexual intercourse in US is 112 times per year (age 18–29), 86 times per year (age 30–39), and 69 times per year (age 40–49).

In a number of sexual harassment cases, certain employees and others have been asked about their sex lives, often repeatedly, including in a case filed against Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

<text>Be Inc. was an American computer company that created and developed the BeOS and BeIA operating systems, and the BeBox personal computer. It was founded in 1990 by former Apple Computer executive Jean-Louis Gassée, who also served as the company&#x27;s CEO, and was based in Menlo Park, California.

The company&#x27;s main intent was to develop a new operating system using the C++ programming language on a proprietary hardware platform; although the result received a mainly positive reception, it had little commercial success. BeOS was initially exclusive to the BeBox before being ported to the Power Macintosh and then to the Intel x86 architecture. After a stint in Internet appliances with BeIA, Be&#x27;s assets were purchased by Palm, Inc. in 2001.

== History ==
Be was founded by former Apple Computer executive Jean-Louis Gassée in 1990 with Steve Sakoman (with capital from Seymour Cray) after being ousted by Apple CEO John Sculley. Legend says that they started building a prototype computer the day after Gassée left Apple Computer, on October 1, 1990. Soon joined also Erich Ringewald, lead engineer in Apple &#x27;Pink&#x27; OS team, as CTO, and joined by a number of other ex-Apple Computer employees. Originally named Be Labs based in San Jose, Gassée and his team worked behind closed doors for over four years before publicly revealing their product.

According to several sources including &quot;Macworld UK&quot;, the company name &quot;Be&quot; originated in a conversation between Gassée and Sakoman. Gassée originally thought the company should be called &quot;United Technoids Inc.&quot;, but Sakoman disagreed and said he would start looking through the dictionary for a better name. A few days later, when Gassée asked if he had made any progress, Sakoman replied that he had got tired and stopped at &quot;B.&quot; Gassée said, &quot; &#x27;Be&#x27; is nice. End of story.&quot; Its original slogan was &quot;One processor per person is not enough&quot;.

The prototype computer evolved into having five AT&amp;T Hobbit processors. By about 1992, Be had started developing a kernel and interface for the hardware, what would eventually become the BeOS. By 1994 the project was nearing completion, but the sudden discontinuation of Hobbit (AT&amp;T exited the processor business due to weak sales) forced Be to look elsewhere. Eventually, the company adopted the PowerPC platform, and ported the then-yet unreleased BeOS to PowerPC.

=== BeBox and BeOS ===
In October 1995, the BeBox personal computer was released by Be, with its distinctive strips of lights along the front that indicate the activity of each PowerPC CPU, and the combined analogue/digital, 37-pin GeekPort. Due to its impressive power and showcase of multimedia applications, the BeBox received much attention at launch, especially by fans and enthusiasts of Amiga. The company&#x27;s financial state was not very good after years of development, but in April 1996 managed to secure funding from &quot;several leading Silicon Valley venture capital firms&quot;.

Toward the end of 1996, Apple Computer was still looking for a replacement to Copland in their operating system strategy. Amidst rumours of Apple&#x27;s interest in purchasing BeOS, Be wanted to increase their user base, to try to convince software developers to write software for the operating system. Be courted Macintosh clone vendors to ship BeOS with their hardware, and Power Computing became a licensee in November 1996. Eventually, the two final options for Apple were BeOS and NeXTSTEP - NeXT was chosen and acquired due to the persuasive influence of Steve Jobs and the incomplete state of the BeOS product, criticized at the time for lacking such features as printing capability. It was rumoured that the deal fell apart because of money, with Be Inc allegedly wanting US$500M and a high-level post in the company, when the NeXT deal closed at US$400M. The rumours were dismissed by Gassée.

=== After BeBox ===
By the start of 1997, a combination of hardware and financial problems led to the discontinuation of BeBox and the company&#x27;s exit from hardware to focus on software. The BeOS software started appearing on some Macintosh clones and was also later to Apple Computer&#x27;s Power Macs despite resistance from Apple, due to the hardware specifications assistance of Power Computing. In 1998, Be acquired StarCode Software which developed the PackageBuilder and SoftwareValet software distribution tool for BeOS. The company also secured new funding, including from Intel which took a 10 percent stake (soon after BeOS was ported to Intel x86 platform). At the same time, the company received its first major partner manufacturer, Hitachi, to bundle BeOS on some of its products.

In July 1999, Be Inc. had an initial public offering, listed on Nasdaq. However the company continued to struggle with adoption, partly due to the agreements of most OEMs with Microsoft preventing the offering of BeOS. An anticipated deal with a &quot;major OEM&quot; later in 1999 did not materialize and led to a decline in its stock.

=== Change of focus ===
The company introduced the BeIA operating system in February 2000 with a declaration that Be Inc. will shift its focus to Internet appliances. Version 5 of BeOS was given away for free as a download, as BeOS could not take off in the market. At the event, Compaq and Hitachi announced that they would release devices running on BeIA.

Be managed to partner with consumer electronics giant Sony which adopted BeIA for its eVilla home internet appliance, unveiled at CES 2001. Be Inc.&#x27;s stock however had by 2001 declined sharply and there were reports that it would soon run out of cash.

===Dissolution and litigation===

Be, Inc. announced on August 16, 2001 that Palm, Inc. will acquire the company for a sum of US$11 million. The deal was approved by Be&#x27;s shareholders on November 13, at which point the company entered dissolution. CEO Gassée went to serve on the board of directors of Palm. Palm was not interested in the desktop operating system market; Palm subsequently spun off a wholly owned subsidiary PalmSource to develop its Palm OS and related software, with the Be assets being transferred to PalmSource. It likely used some BeOS code in Palm OS 6. PalmSource (and hence the rights of BeOS) was subsequently acquired by Japanese-based ACCESS.

The Be company (while under dissolution) initiated litigation against Microsoft for aggressively anti-competitive and monopolistic business practices. Joining a long history of antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft, Be specifically contested Microsoft&#x27;s prohibition of OEMs to allow dual-boot systems containing both Microsoft and non-Microsoft operating systems, and that Compaq had been pressured not to market an Internet appliance in partnership with Be. Be also claimed that Microsoft acted to artificially depress Be Inc.&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO). The suit was settled out of court in September 2003 with a US$23.25 million payout to Be, Inc.

==Legacy==
After Palm&#x27;s acquisition of Be&#x27;s assets, &quot;The Register&quot; wrote that Be shouldn&#x27;t be viewed as a failure:

The open source operating system Haiku resumed BeOS&#x27;s legacy in the form of a complete reimplementation. Beta 5 of Haiku was released in September 2024.

<text>Praseodymium is a chemical element; it has symbol Pr and the atomic number 59. It is the third member of the lanthanide series and is considered one of the rare-earth metals. It is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal, valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in native form, and pure praseodymium metal slowly develops a green oxide coating when exposed to air.

Praseodymium always occurs naturally together with the other rare-earth metals. It is the sixth-most abundant rare-earth element and fourth-most abundant lanthanide, making up 9.1 parts per million of the Earth&#x27;s crust, an abundance similar to that of boron. In 1841, Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander extracted a rare-earth oxide residue he called didymium from a residue he called &quot;lanthana&quot;, in turn separated from cerium salts. In 1885, the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into two elements that gave salts of different colours, which he named praseodymium and neodymium. The name praseodymium comes from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &#x27;leek-green&#x27;, and () &#x27;twin&#x27;.

Like most rare-earth elements, praseodymium most readily forms the +3 oxidation state, which is the only stable state in aqueous solution, although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 oxidation state is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions. The 0, +1, and +2 oxidation states are rarely found. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly, praseodymium results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium&#x27;s industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources.

==Physical properties==
Praseodymium is the third member of the lanthanide series, and a member of the rare-earth metals. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides cerium to its left and neodymium to its right, and above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness comparable to that of silver. Praseodymium is calculated to have a very large atomic radius; with a radius of 247 pm, barium, rubidium and caesium are larger. However, observationally, it is usually 185 pm.

Neutral praseodymium&#x27;s 59 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Xe]4f36s2.
Like most other lanthanides, praseodymium usually uses only three electrons as valence electrons, as the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound to engage in bonding: this is because the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this penetration increases with higher ionic charge. Even so, praseodymium can in some compounds lose a fourth valence electron because it is early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons.

Similarly to the other early lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature, called the alpha phase (α-Pr). At it transforms to a different allotrope that has a body-centered cubic structure (β-Pr), and it melts at .

Praseodymium, like all of the lanthanides, is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1 K.

==Chemical properties==

Praseodymium metal tarnishes slowly in air, forming a spalling green oxide layer like iron rust; a centimetre-sized sample of praseodymium metal corrodes completely in about a year. It burns readily at 150 °C to form praseodymium(III,IV) oxide, a nonstoichiometric compound approximating to Pr6O11:
:12 Pr + 11 O2 → 2 Pr6O11

This may be reduced to praseodymium(III) oxide (Pr2O3) with hydrogen gas. Praseodymium(IV) oxide, PrO2, is the most oxidised product of the combustion of praseodymium and can be obtained by either reaction of praseodymium metal with pure oxygen at 400 °C and 282 bar or by disproportionation of Pr6O11 in boiling acetic acid. The reactivity of praseodymium conforms to periodic trends, as it is one of the first and thus one of the largest lanthanides. At 1000 °C, many praseodymium oxides with composition PrO2−&quot;x&quot; exist as disordered, nonstoichiometric phases with 0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; 0.25, but at 400–700 °C the oxide defects are instead ordered, creating phases of the general formula Pr&quot;n&quot;O2&quot;n&quot;−2 with &quot;n&quot; = 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and ∞. These phases PrO&quot;y&quot; are sometimes labelled α and β′ (nonstoichiometric), β (&quot;y&quot; = 1.833), δ (1.818), ε (1.8), ζ (1.778), ι (1.714), θ, and σ.

Praseodymium is an electropositive element and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form praseodymium(III) hydroxide:
:2 Pr (s) + 6 H2O (l) → 2 Pr(OH)3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g)

Praseodymium metal reacts with all the stable halogens to form trihalides:
:2 Pr (s) + 3 F2 (g) → 2 PrF3 (s) [green]
:2 Pr (s) + 3 Cl2 (g) → 2 PrCl3 (s) [green]
:2 Pr (s) + 3 Br2 (g) → 2 PrBr3 (s) [green]
:2 Pr (s) + 3 I2 (g) → 2 PrI3 (s)
The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is produced by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride is removed from the reaction mixture with liquid hydrogen fluoride. Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and gadolinium, it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.

Praseodymium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the chartreuse Pr3+ ions, which exist as [Pr(H2O)9]3+ complexes:

:2 Pr (s) + 3 H2SO4 (aq) → 2 Pr3+ (aq) + 3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g)

Dissolving praseodymium(IV) compounds in water does not result in solutions containing the yellow Pr4+ ions; because of the high positive standard reduction potential of the Pr4+/Pr3+ couple at +3.2 V, these ions are unstable in aqueous solution, oxidising water and being reduced to Pr3+. The value for the Pr3+/Pr couple is −2.35 V. However, in highly basic aqueous media, Pr4+ ions can be generated by oxidation with ozone.

Although praseodymium(V) in the bulk state is unknown, the existence of praseodymium in its +5 oxidation state (with the stable electron configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon) under noble-gas matrix isolation conditions was reported in 2016. The species assigned to the +5 state were identified as [PrO2]+, its O2 and Ar adducts, and PrO2(η2-O2).

=== Organopraseodymium compounds ===

Organopraseodymium compounds are very similar to those of the other lanthanides, as they all share an inability to undergo π backbonding. They are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides (isostructural with those of lanthanum) and the σ-bonded simple alkyls and aryls, some of which may be polymeric. The coordination chemistry of praseodymium is largely that of the large, electropositive Pr3+ ion, and is thus largely similar to those of the other early lanthanides La3+, Ce3+, and Nd3+. For instance, like lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium, praseodymium nitrates form both 4:3 and 1:1 complexes with 18-crown-6, whereas the middle lanthanides from promethium to gadolinium can only form the 4:3 complex and the later lanthanides from terbium to lutetium cannot successfully coordinate to all the ligands. Such praseodymium complexes have high but uncertain coordination numbers and poorly defined stereochemistry, with exceptions resulting from exceptionally bulky ligands such as the tricoordinate [Pr{N(SiMe3)2}3]. There are also a few mixed oxides and fluorides involving praseodymium(IV), but it does not have an appreciable coordination chemistry in this oxidation state like its neighbour cerium. However, the first example of a molecular complex of praseodymium(IV) has recently been reported.

==Isotopes==

Praseodymium has only one stable and naturally occurring isotope, 141Pr. It is thus a mononuclidic and monoisotopic element, and its standard atomic weight can be determined with high precision as it is a constant of nature. This isotope has 82 neutrons, which is a magic number that confers additional stability. This isotope is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively). Thirty-eight other radioisotopes have been synthesized. All of these isotopes have half-lives under a day (and most under a minute), with the single exception of 143Pr with a half-life of 13.6 days. Both 143Pr and 141Pr occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 141Pr is positron emission or electron capture to isotopes of cerium, while that of heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of neodymium.

==History==
In 1751, the Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt discovered a heavy mineral from the mine at Bastnäs, later named cerite. Thirty years later, the fifteen-year-old Wilhelm Hisinger, from the family owning the mine, sent a sample of it to Carl Scheele, who did not find any new elements within. In 1803, after Hisinger had become an ironmaster, he returned to the mineral with Jöns Jacob Berzelius and isolated a new oxide, which they named &quot;ceria&quot; after the dwarf planet Ceres, which had been discovered two years earlier. Ceria was simultaneously and independently isolated in Germany by Martin Heinrich Klaproth. Between 1839 and 1843, ceria was shown to be a mixture of oxides by the Swedish surgeon and chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, who lived in the same house as Berzelius; he separated out two other oxides, which he named &quot;lanthana&quot; and &quot;didymia&quot;. He partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by roasting it in air and then treating the resulting oxide with dilute nitric acid. The metals that formed these oxides were thus named &quot;lanthanum&quot; and &quot;didymium&quot;.

While lanthanum turned out to be a pure element, didymium was not and turned out to be only a mixture of all the stable early lanthanides from praseodymium to europium, as had been suspected by Marc Delafontaine after spectroscopic analysis, though he lacked the time to pursue its separation into its constituents. The heavy pair of samarium and europium were only removed in 1879 by Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and it was not until 1885 that Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into praseodymium and neodymium. Von Welsbach confirmed the separation by spectroscopic analysis, but the products were of relatively low purity. Since neodymium was a larger constituent of didymium than praseodymium, it kept the old name with disambiguation, while praseodymium was distinguished by the leek-green colour of its salts (Greek πρασιος, &quot;leek green&quot;). The composite nature of didymium had previously been suggested in 1882 by Bohuslav Brauner, who did not experimentally pursue its separation.

==Occurrence and production==
Praseodymium is not particularly rare, despite it being in the rare-earth metals, making up 9.2 mg/kg of the Earth&#x27;s crust. Praseodymium&#x27;s classification as a rare-earth metal comes from its rarity relative to &quot;common earths&quot; such as lime and magnesia, the few known minerals containing it for which extraction is commercially viable, as well as the length and complexity of extraction. Although not particularly rare, praseodymium is never found as a dominant rare earth in praseodymium-bearing minerals. It is always preceded by cerium and lanthanum and usually also by neodymium.
The Pr3+ ion is similar in size to the early lanthanides of the cerium group (those from lanthanum up to samarium and europium) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and bastnäsite (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare-earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y, with somewhat less Nd and Pr). Bastnäsite is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride. The product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.

The procedure for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earth, as well as thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earth. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4, during which thorium precipitates as hydroxide and is removed. The solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earth to their insoluble oxalates, the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing, and the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid. This last step excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.

Praseodymium may then be separated from the other lanthanides via ion-exchange chromatography, or by using a solvent such as tributyl phosphate where the solubility of Ln3+ increases as the atomic number increases. If ion-exchange chromatography is used, the mixture of lanthanides is loaded into one column of cation-exchange resin and Cu2+ or Zn2+ or Fe3+ is loaded into the other. An aqueous solution of a complexing agent, known as the eluant (usually triammonium edtate), is passed through the columns, and Ln3+ is displaced from the first column and redeposited in a compact band at the top of the column before being re-displaced by . The Gibbs free energy of formation for Ln(edta·H) complexes increases along with the lanthanides by about one quarter from Ce3+ to Lu3+, so that the Ln3+ cations descend the development column in a band and are fractionated repeatedly, eluting from heaviest to lightest. They are then precipitated as their insoluble oxalates, burned to form the oxides, and then reduced to metals.

==Applications==
Leo Moser (not to be confused with the mathematician of the same name), son of Ludwig Moser, founder of the Moser Glassworks in what is now Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic, investigated the use of praseodymium in glass coloration in the late 1920s, yielding a yellow-green glass given the name &quot;Prasemit&quot;. However, at that time far cheaper colorants could give a similar color, so Prasemit was not popular, few pieces were made, and examples are now extremely rare. Moser also blended praseodymium with neodymium to produce &quot;Heliolite&quot; glass (&quot;Heliolit&quot; in German), which was more widely accepted. The first enduring commercial use of purified praseodymium, which continues today, is in the form of a yellow-orange &quot;Praseodymium Yellow&quot; stain for ceramics, which is a solid solution in the zircon lattice. This stain has no hint of green in it; by contrast, at sufficiently high loadings, praseodymium glass is distinctly green rather than pure yellow.

Like many other lanthanides, praseodymium&#x27;s shielded f-orbitals allow for long excited state lifetimes and high luminescence yields. Pr3+ as a dopant ion therefore sees many applications in optics and photonics. These include , single-mode fiber optical amplifiers, fiber lasers, upconverting nanoparticles as well as activators in red, green, blue, and ultraviolet phosphors. Silicate crystals doped with praseodymium ions have also been used to slow a light pulse down to a few hundred meters per second.

As the lanthanides are so similar, praseodymium can substitute for most other lanthanides without significant loss of function, and indeed many applications such as mischmetal and ferrocerium alloys involve variable mixes of several lanthanides, including small quantities of praseodymium. The following more modern applications involve praseodymium specifically or at least praseodymium in a small subset of the lanthanides:
* In combination with neodymium, another rare-earth element, praseodymium is used to create high-power magnets notable for their strength and durability. In general, most alloys of the cerium-group rare earths (lanthanum through samarium) with 3d transition metals give extremely stable magnets that are often used in small equipment, such as motors, printers, watches, headphones, loudspeakers, and magnetic storage.
*Praseodymium–nickel intermetallic (PrNi5) has such a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed scientists to approach within one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero.
* As an alloying agent with magnesium to create high-strength metals that are used in aircraft engines; yttrium and neodymium are suitable substitutes.
* Praseodymium is present in the rare-earth mixture whose fluoride forms the core of carbon arc lights, which are used in the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projector lights.
* Praseodymium compounds give glasses, enamels and ceramics a yellow color.
* Praseodymium is a component of didymium glass, which is used to make certain types of welder&#x27;s and glass blower&#x27;s goggles.
* Praseodymium oxide in solid solution with ceria or ceria-zirconia has been used as an oxidation catalyst.

Due to its role in permanent magnets used for wind turbines, it has been argued that praseodymium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy. However, this perspective has been criticized for failing to recognize that most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production.

==Biological role and precautions==
The early lanthanides have been found to be essential to some methanotrophic bacteria living in volcanic mudpots, such as &quot;Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum&quot;: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium are about equally effective. Praseodymium is otherwise not known to have a biological role in any other organisms, but it is not very toxic either. Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals has been known to impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.

<text>The Black Arrows, one of the predecessors to the current Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team the Red Arrows, were an aerobatic demonstration team formed in 1956 by Squadron Leader Roger L.Topp, then Commanding Officer 111 Squadron (&quot;treble-one&quot;). One of the many memorable feats accomplished by the Black Arrows was the execution of a world record loop of 22 Hawker Hunters in formation at the Society of British Aircraft Constructors&#x27; show at Farnborough in 1958. This was a world record for the greatest number of aircraft looped in formation, and remains unbroken to this day. After the loop the Black Arrows performed the world&#x27;s first 16 aircraft barrel roll. Roger Topp handed over the lead of the Black Arrows to Squadron Leader Peter Latham in late 1958. Latham expanded the size of the team to nine aircraft from the original five and led the Squadron for two years.

No. 111 Squadron was formed at RAF North Weald where they received the Hunter before moving to RAF Wattisham in Suffolk. Until 1961, the Black Arrows were the RAF&#x27;s premier team. In the early years of the 1960s the &quot;Blue Diamonds&quot; of No. 92 Squadron RAF (also flying Hunters), &quot;The Tigers&quot; of No. 74 Squadron RAF, equipped with the new English Electric Lightning, the &quot;Red Pelicans&quot; flying BAC Jet Provosts, and the &quot;Yellowjacks&quot; flying Folland Gnats formed. The large number of squadron display teams later rationalised to a single unit from the Central Flying School.

<doc id="251723" wikidata="Q2915250" url="?curid=251723" title="Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907">
<text>The  was an informal agreement between the United States of America and the Empire of Japan whereby Japan would not allow further emigration of laborers to the United States and the United States would not impose restrictions on Japanese immigrants already present in the country. The goal was to reduce tensions between the two Pacific nations such as those that followed the Pacific Coast race riots of 1907 and the segregation of Japanese students in public schools. The agreement was not a treaty and so was not voted on by the United States Congress. It was superseded by the Immigration Act of 1924.

==Background==

Chinese immigration to California boomed during the Gold Rush of 1852, but the Japanese government practiced strict policies of isolation that thwarted Japanese emigration. In 1868, the Japanese government lessened restrictions, and Japanese immigration to the United States began. Anti-Chinese sentiment motivated American entrepreneurs to recruit Japanese laborers.

Most Japanese immigrants wanted to reside in America permanently and came in family groups, in contrast to the Chinese immigrants, most of whom were young men who soon returned to China. Japanese immigrants assimilated to American social norms, such as those on clothing. Many joined Methodist and Presbyterian churches.

As the Japanese population in California grew, they were viewed with suspicion as an entering wedge by Japan. By 1905, Japanese Americans lived not only in Chinatown but throughout San Francisco, while anti-Japanese rhetoric was common in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; newspaper. In that year, the &quot;Japanese and Korean Exclusion League&quot; was established to promote four policies:
#extension of the Chinese Exclusion Act to include Japanese and Koreans,
#exclusion by League members of Japanese employees and the hiring of firms that employ Japanese,
#pressuring the School Board to segregate Japanese from white children,
#a propaganda campaign to inform Congress and the President of the &quot;menace&quot;.

Tensions had been rising in San Francisco, and since Japan&#x27;s decisive victory against Russia in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan demanded treatment as an equal. The result was a series of six notes communicated between Japan and the United States from late 1907 to early 1908. 
The immediate cause of the Agreement was anti-Japanese nativism in California. In 1906, the San Francisco Board of Education passed a regulation whereby children of Japanese descent would be required to attend separate, segregated schools. At the time, Japanese immigrants made up approximately 1% of the population of California, many of whom had immigrated under a treaty in 1894 that had assured free immigration from Japan.

In the Agreement, Japan agreed not to issue passports for Japanese citizens wishing to work in the Continental United States, thus effectively eliminating new Japanese immigration to the United States. In exchange, the United States agreed to accept the presence of Japanese immigrants already residing there; to permit the immigration of wives, children, and parents; and to avoid legal discrimination against Japanese American children in California schools. There was also a strong desire on the part of the Japanese government to resist being treated as inferiors. Japan did not want the United States to pass any legislation such as had happened to the Chinese under the Chinese Exclusion Act. US President Theodore Roosevelt, who had a positive opinion of Japan, accepted the Agreement as proposed by Japan to avoid more formal immigration restrictions.

==Segregation of schools==
At the time, there were 93 Japanese students spread across 23 elementary schools. For decades, policies segregated Japanese schools, but they were not enforced as long as there was room and white parents did not complain. The Japanese and Korean Exclusion League appeared before the school board multiple times to complain. The school board dismissed its claims because it was fiscally infeasible to create new facilities to accommodate only 93 students. After the 1906 fire, the school board sent the 93 Japanese students to the Chinese Primary School and renamed it &quot;The Oriental Public School for Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans.&quot; Transportation was limited after the earthquake, and many students could not attend the Oriental Public School.

Many Japanese Americans argued with the school board that the segregation of schools went against the Treaty of 1894, which did not expressly address education but indicated that Japanese in America would receive equal rights. Under the controlling decisions of the United States Supreme Court (&quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, 1896), a state did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution by requiring racial segregation so long as the separate facilities were substantially equal. Tokyo newspapers denounced the segregation as an insult to Japanese pride and honor. The Japanese government wanted to protect its reputation as a world power. Government officials became aware that a crisis was at hand, and intervention was necessary to maintain diplomatic peace.

===Federal intervention===
President Roosevelt had three objectives to resolve the situation: showing Japan that the policies of California did not reflect the ideals of the entire country, forcing San Francisco to remove the segregation policies, and reaching a resolution to the Japanese immigration problem. Victor Metcalf, Secretary of Commerce and Labor, was sent to investigate the issue and to force the rescission of the policies. He was unsuccessful since local officials wanted Japanese exclusion. Roosevelt tried to pressure the school board, but it would not budge. On February 15, 1907, the parties came to a compromise. If Roosevelt could ensure the suspension of Japanese immigration, the school board would allow Japanese American students to attend public schools. The Japanese government did not want to harm its national pride or to suffer humiliation like the Qing government in 1882 in China from the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Japanese government agreed to stop granting passports to laborers who were trying to enter the United States unless such laborers were coming to occupy a formerly-acquired home; to join a parent, spouse, or child; or to assume active control of a previously acquired farming enterprise.

Concessions were agreed in a note consisting of six points a year later. The agreement was followed by the admission of students of Japanese ancestry into public schools. The adoption of the 1907 Agreement spurred the arrival of &quot;picture brides,&quot; marriages of convenience made at a distance through photographs. By establishing marital bonds at a distance, women seeking to emigrate to the United States were able to gain a passport, and Japanese workers in America were able to gain a partner of their own nationality. Because of that provision, which helped close the gender gap within the community from a ratio of 7 men to every woman in 1910 to less than 2 to 1 by 1920, the Japanese American population continued to grow despite the Agreement&#x27;s limits on immigration. The Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement was never written into a law passed by the US Congress, but was an informal agreement between the United States and Japan, enacted via unilateral action by President Roosevelt. It was nullified by the Immigration Act of 1924, which legally banned all Asians from migrating to the United States.

<doc id="251725" wikidata="Q886959" url="?curid=251725" title="List of governors of Wisconsin">
<text>The governor of Wisconsin is the head of government of Wisconsin and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s army and air forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Wisconsin Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.

Forty-four individuals have held the office of governor of Wisconsin since the state&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1848, one of whom—Philip La Follette—served non-consecutive terms. Nelson Dewey, the first governor, took office on June 7, 1848. The longest-serving governor was Tommy Thompson, who took office on January 5, 1987, and resigned on February 1, 2001, a total of 14 years and 28 days. Arthur MacArthur Sr. had the shortest term: he was governor for a total of just 5 days—from March 21 to 25, 1856. The current governor is Tony Evers, a Democrat who took office on January 7, 2019.

==List of governors==

Initially after the American Revolution, parts of the area now known as Wisconsin were claimed by Virginia, Massachusetts and Connecticut; however, Virginia ceded its claim in 1784, Massachusetts in 1785 and Connecticut in 1786. On July 13, 1787, the Northwest Territory, including the area now called Wisconsin, was formed; Wisconsin remained part of the territory until 1800. The territorial governor during this period was Arthur St. Clair. As parts of the Northwest Territory were admitted to the Union as states, Wisconsin became part of first the Indiana Territory (1800–1809), then the Illinois Territory (1809–1818), and then the Michigan Territory (1818–1836); see the lists of governors of Indiana, of Illinois, and of Michigan for these periods.

===Wisconsin Territory===

Wisconsin Territory was formed on July 3, 1836. During the time of its existence, the Wisconsin Territory had three people appointed governor by the President of the United States, one of whom served non-consecutive terms.

When most of Wisconsin Territory was admitted as the state of Wisconsin, the remainder became unorganized territory. However, the citizens of the region maintained a territorial government, and even elected a delegate to the United States House of Representatives, essentially making it a &quot;de facto&quot; continuation of Wisconsin Territory. As the region no longer had an official governor, Territorial Secretary John Catlin acted as governor of the region.

===State of Wisconsin===

Wisconsin was admitted to the Union on May 29, 1848. Since then, it has had 45 governors, one of whom served non-consecutive terms.

Originally, governors of Wisconsin served for two-year terms, but in 1967 the state constitution was amended to change this to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served 1 3-year term in the 1880s as the constitution was amended during his first term to move elections from odd to even years, and all officers were allowed to serve an extra year, rather than have their terms cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a 4-year term. Governors of Wisconsin are not term limited.

Lucius Fairchild, Jeremiah McLain Rusk, Robert M. La Follette, Emanuel L. Philipp, John J. Blaine, Walter J. Kohler Jr., Warren P. Knowles and Tommy Thompson are one of eight Wisconsin governors to have served three terms. Thompson is the only person to have won four terms having been elected in 1986 and re-elected in 1990, 1994 and again in 1998 before resigning in February 2001.

The state constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor; originally, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected on different tickets, and thus were not necessarily of the same party. Since the 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted on, together. Originally, if the office of the governor was vacant for any reason, &quot;the powers and duties of the office . . . devolve[d] upon the lieutenant governor.&quot; In 1979, the constitution was amended to make this more specific: if the governor dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, but becomes acting governor if the governor is absent from the state, impeached, or unable to carry out of duties. If any of these events occur while the office of lieutenant governor is vacant, the secretary of state becomes either governor or acting governor. Two Wisconsin governors have died while in office, one has died after being elected but before taking office, and four have resigned.

<doc id="251728" wikidata="Q200661" url="?curid=251728" title="Juan Rulfo">
<text>Juan Nepomuceno Carlos Pérez Rulfo Vizcaíno, best known as Juan Rulfo (; 16 May 1917 – 7 January 1986), was a Mexican writer, screenwriter, and photographer. He is best known for two literary works, the 1955 novel &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;, and the collection of short stories &quot;El Llano en llamas&quot; (1953). This collection includes the popular tale &quot;¡Diles que no me maten!&quot; (&quot;Tell Them Not to Kill Me!&quot;).

==Early life==
Rulfo was born in 1917 in Apulco, Jalisco (Disputed as being in San Gabriel, Jalisco) Mexico, although he was registered at Sayula, in the home of his paternal grandfather. Rulfo&#x27;s birth year was often listed as 1918, because he had provided an inaccurate date to get into the military academy that his uncle, David Pérez Rulfo — a colonel working for the government — directed.

After his father was killed in 1923 and his mother died in 1927, Rulfo&#x27;s grandmother raised him in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Their extended family consisted of landowners whose fortunes were ruined by the Mexican Revolution and the Cristero War of 1926–1928, a Roman Catholic revolt against the persecutions of Christians by the Mexican government, following the Mexican Revolution.

Rulfo was sent to study in the Luis Silva School, where he lived from 1928 to 1932. He completed six years of elementary school and a special seventh year from which he graduated as a bookkeeper, though he never practiced that profession. Rulfo attended a seminary (analogous to a secondary school) from 1932 to 1934, but did not attend a university afterwards, as the University of Guadalajara was closed due to a strike and because Rulfo had not taken preparatory school courses.

Rulfo moved to Mexico City, where he entered the National Military Academy, which he left after three months. He then hoped to study law at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. In 1936, Rulfo was able to audit courses in literature at the University, because he obtained a job as an immigration file clerk through his uncle.

==Career==

At the University Rulfo began writing under the tutelage of a coworker, . In 1944, Rulfo co-founded the literary journal &quot;Pan&quot;. Later, he was able to advance in his career and travel throughout Mexico as an immigration agent. In 1946, he started as a foreman for Goodrich-Euzkadi, but his mild temperament led him to prefer working as a wholesale traveling sales agent. This obligated him to travel throughout all of southern Mexico, until he was fired in 1952 for asking for a radio for his company car.

Rulfo obtained a fellowship at the Centro Mexicano de Escritores, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. There, between 1952 and 1954, he was able to write two books.

The first book was a collection of harshly realistic short stories, &quot;El Llano en llamas&quot; (1953). The stories centered on life in rural Mexico around the time of the Mexican Revolution and the Cristero War. Among the best-known stories are &quot;¡Diles que no me maten!&quot; (&quot;Tell Them Not To Kill Me!&quot;), a story about an old man, set to be executed, who is captured by order of a colonel, who happens to be the son of a man whom the condemned man had killed about forty years ago, the story contains echoes of the biblical Cain and Abel theme as well as themes critical to the Mexican Revolution such as land rights and land use; and &quot;No oyes ladrar los perros&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t You Hear the Dogs Barking(?)&quot;), about a man carrying his estranged, adult, wounded son on his back to find a doctor.

The second book was &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot; (1955), a short novel about a man named Juan Preciado who travels to his recently deceased mother&#x27;s hometown, Comala, to find his father, only to come across a literal ghost town ─ populated, that is, by spectral figures. Initially, the novel met with cool critical reception and sold only two thousand copies during the first four years; later, however, the book became highly acclaimed. &quot;Páramo&quot; was a key influence for Latin American writers such as Gabriel García Márquez. &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot; has been translated into more than 30 languages, and the English version has sold more than a million copies in the United States.

The book went through several changes in name. In two letters written in 1947 to his fiancée Clara Aparicio, he refers to the novel he was writing as &quot;Una estrella junto a la luna&quot; (&quot;A Star Next to the Moon&quot;), saying that it was causing him some trouble. During the last stages of writing, he wrote in journals that the title would be &quot;Los murmullos&quot; (&quot;The Murmurs&quot;). With the assistance of a grant from the Centro Mexicano de Escritores, Rulfo was able to finish the book between 1953 and 1954; it was published in 1955.

In passages of the novel &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;, the influence of American novelist William Faulkner is notorious, according to Rulfo&#x27;s former friend, philologist Antonio Alatorre, in an interview with the latter made by journalists of Mexican newspaper &quot;El Universal&quot; in November 1998, which was published on 31 October 2010.

Between 1956 and 1958, Rulfo worked on a novella entitled &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;), which was not published until 1980. A revised and corrected edition was issued posthumously in 2010. The Fundación Rulfo possesses fragments of two unfinished novels, &quot;La cordillera&quot; and &quot;Ozumacín.&quot; Rulfo told interviewer Luis Harss that he had written and destroyed an earlier novel set in Mexico City.

From 1954 to 1957, Rulfo collaborated with &quot;La comisión del rio Papaloapan&quot;, a government institution working on socioeconomic development of the settlements along the Papaloapan River. From 1962 until his death in 1986, he worked as editor for the National Institute for Indigenous People.
==Personal life==

Rulfo married Clara Angelina Aparicio Reyes (Mexico City, 12 August 1928) in Guadalajara, Jalisco, on 24 April 1948; they had four children, Claudia Berenice (Mexico City, 29 January 1949), Juan Francisco (Guadalajara, Jalisco, 13 December 1950), Juan Pablo (México City, 18 April 1955) and Juan Carlos Rulfo (México City, 24 January 1964).

==Legacy==

Gabriel García Márquez has said that he felt blocked as a novelist after writing his first four books and that it was only his life-changing discovery of &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot; in 1961 that opened the way to the composition of his masterpiece, &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. He noted that all of Rulfo&#x27;s published writing, put together, &quot;add up to no more than 300 pages; but that is almost as many and I believe they are as durable, as the pages that have come down to us from Sophocles&quot;.

Jorge Luis Borges considered &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot; to be one of the greatest texts written in any language.

The Juan Rulfo Foundation, which was established by Rulfo&#x27;s family after his death, holds more than 6,000 negatives of his photographs. A selection of Rulfo&#x27;s photographs, accompanied by essays by Carlos Fuentes and others, has been published under the title of &quot;Juan Rulfo&#x27;s Mexico&quot;.

Rulfo was honored by Google Doodles on what would have been his 95th birthday. The doodle was launched on May 16, 2012 in Mexico.

<text>Brian Brett (April 28, 1950 – January 17, 2024) was a Canadian poet, journalist, editor and novelist. Brett wrote and published extensively, starting in the late 1960s, and he worked as an editor for several publishing firms, including the Governor-General&#x27;s Award-winning Blackfish Press. He also wrote a three-part memoir of his life in British Columbia.

==Early life==
Brian Brett was born in British Columbia. He grew up with a rare endocrine disorder, Kallmann syndrome, which prevented his body from entering puberty; he later wrote a memoir about the effect this has had on his life.
Brett attended Simon Fraser University between 1969 and 1974, studying literature.

==Career==

Brett began writing in the 1960s. In the early 1970s, he worked as a freelance journalist and critic for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, &quot;The New Reader&quot;, &quot;Books in Canada&quot;, and the &quot;Victoria Times-Colonist&quot;. He was a poetry critic and columnist for Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;The Province&quot;. He also wrote articles for many other newspapers in Canada, and his essays appeared in many magazines. For ten years he wrote a monthly newspaper column called CultureWatch for the &quot;Yukon News&quot;.

Brett inaugurated the B.C. Poetry-in-the-Schools program, which for several years introduced students to world poetry. He has presented many writing workshops across Canada.

Brett was a member of P.E.N. International and the Federation of BC Writers, and the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada. He embarked on a national reading tour organized by the League of Canadian Poets, of which he was also a member.

Brett gave readings of his work on CBC Radio as well at universities, Harbourfront, Vancouver International Writers Festival, Saltwater Festival, Sechelt Writers&#x27; Festival, , the Winnipeg International Writers Festival, National Book Festival, and the Canada Council.

In May 2005, Brett became chair of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada.

In 2004 Brett published a book, &quot;Uproar&#x27;s Your Only Music&quot;, about his struggles with Kallmann syndrome.

In November 2009, Brett won Canada&#x27;s Writers&#x27; Trust Non-Fiction Prize for &quot;Trauma Farm: A Rebel History of Rural Life&quot;. The book describes a typical day in the life of his farm, with insight into the natural history of farming.

In 2016, the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada awarded Brett the Matt Cohen Lifetime Award to honour his body of work.

==Personal life and death==
Brett lived on his farm on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia. He took testosterone to mitigate the effects of Kallmann syndrome, which included pain and osteoporosis. Brett died on January 17, 2024, at the age of 73.

<text>Arabic music () is the music of the Arab world with all its diverse music styles and genres. Arabic countries have many rich and varied styles of music and also many linguistic dialects, with each country and region having their own traditional music.

Arabic music has a long history of interaction with many other regional musical styles and genres. It represents the music of all the peoples that make up the Arab world today.

==History==

=== Pre-Islamic period ===
Pre-Islamic Arabia was the cradle of many intellectual achievements, including music, musical theory and the development of musical instruments. In Yemen, the main center of pre-Islamic Arab sciences, literature and arts, musicians benefited from the patronage of the Kings of Sabaʾ who encouraged the development of music. For many centuries, the Arabs of Hejaz recognized that the best real Arabian music came from Yemen, and Hadhrami minstrels were considered to be superior. Pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula music was similar to that of Ancient Middle Eastern music. Most historians agree that there existed distinct forms of music in the Arabian peninsula in the pre-Islamic period between the 5th and 7th century AD. Arab poets of that time—called &quot;shu`ara&#x27; al-Jahiliyah&quot; (Arabic: شعراء الجاهلية) or &quot;Jahili poets&quot;, meaning &quot;the poets of the period of ignorance&quot;—used to recite poems with a high notes.

It was believed that Jinns revealed poems to poets and music to musicians. The choir at the time served as a pedagogic facility where the educated poets would recite their poems. Singing was not thought to be the work of these intellectuals and was instead entrusted to women with beautiful voices who would learn how to play some instruments used at that time such as the drum, the lute or the rebab, and perform the songs while respecting the poetic metre. The compositions were simple and every singer would sing in a single &quot;maqam&quot;. Among the notable songs of the period were the &quot;huda&quot; (from which the &quot;ghina&quot; derived), the &quot;nasb&quot;, &quot;sanad&quot;, and &quot;rukbani&quot;.

===Early Islamic period===

Both compositions and improvisations in traditional Arabic music are based on the &quot;maqam&quot; system. &quot;Maqams&quot; can be realized with either vocal or instrumental music, and do not include a rhythmic component.

Al-Kindi (801–873 AD) was a notable early theorist of Arabic music. He joined several others like al-Farabi in proposing the addition of a makeshift fifth string to the oud. He published several tracts on musical theory, including the cosmological connotations of music. He identified twelve tones on the Arabic musical scale, based on the location of fingers on and the strings of the oud.

Abulfaraj (897–967) wrote the &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot;, an encyclopedic collection of poems and songs that runs to over 20 volumes in modern editions.

Al-Farabi (872–950) wrote a notable book on Islamic music titled &quot;Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir&quot; (The Great Book of Music). His pure Arabian tone system is still used in Arabic music.

Al-Ghazali (1059–1111) wrote a treatise on music in Persia which declared, &quot;Ecstasy means the state that comes from listening to music&quot;.

In 1252, Safi al-Din developed a unique form of musical notation, where rhythms were represented by geometric representation. A similar geometric representation would not appear in the Western world until 1987, when Kjell Gustafson published a method to represent a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.

====Al-Andalus====
By the 11th century, Islamic Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually throughout France, influencing French troubadours, and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. The English words lute, rebec, and naker are derived from Arabic oud, rabab or Maghreb rebab, and naqareh.

===16th to 19th century===
Bartol Gyurgieuvits (1506–1566) spent 13 years as a slave in the Ottoman Empire. After escaping, he published &quot;De Turcarum ritu et caermoniis&quot; in Amsterdam in 1544. It is one of the first European books to describe music in Islamic society.

=== 20th century–present ===
In the early 20th century, Egypt was the first in a series of Arab countries to experience a sudden emergence of nationalism, as it became independent after 2000 years of foreign rule. English, French and European songs were replaced by national Egyptian music. Cairo became a center for musical innovation.

Female singers were some of the first to adopt a secular approach. Egyptian performer Umm Kulthum and Lebanese singer Fairuz were notable examples of this. Both have been popular through the decades that followed and considered legends of Arabic music. Moroccan singer Zohra Al Fassiya was the first female singer to achieve wide popularity in the Maghreb region, performing traditional Arab Andalusian folk songs and later recording numerous albums of her own.

During the 1940s and 1960s, Arabic music began to take on a more Western tone – Egyptian artists Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez along with composers Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Baligh Hamdi pioneered the use of western instruments in Egyptian music. By the 1970s several other singers had followed suit and a strand of Arabic pop was born. Arabic pop usually consists of Western styled songs with Arabic instruments and lyrics. Melodies are often a mix between Eastern and Western.

Western pop music was also influenced by Arabic music in the early 1960s, leading to the development of surf music, a rock music genre that later gave rise to garage rock and punk rock. Surf rock pioneer Dick Dale, a Lebanese American guitarist, was greatly influenced by the Arabic music he learnt from his uncle, particularly the oud melodies and skills which he later applied to his electric guitar playing when recording surf rock in the early 1960s.

Baligh Hamdi who created and composed many hit songs for several Arab singers, frequently said that he drew upon musical ideas and aesthetics in Egyptian folk melodies and rhythms in composing his songs. He also drew on ideas in the contemporary music of his time. His sound has a classical flavor due to the heavy use of the string orchestra. But he also made some use of electronic keyboards and guitars in harmony with the strings, or alternating with the strings.
His best work is published as recordings under the name of the singer. The singers include Umm Kulthum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Shadia, Layla Murad, Najat Al Saghira, Fayza Ahmed, Warda (whom he was married to for a decade), Sabah, and other singers. He had also collaborated with the legendary singer Aziza Jalal who promoted her songs Mestaniak and Haramt El Hob Alaya one of the best Arabic songs in the 80s.

In the 1990s, Arab artists who took up this style were Amr Diab, Moustafa Amar, Najwa Karam, Elissa, Nawal Al Zoghbi, Nancy Ajram, Haifa Wehbe, Angham, Fadl Shaker, Majida Al Roumi, Wael Kfoury, Asalah Nasri, Myriam Fares, Carole Samaha, Yara, Samira Said, Hisham Abbas, Kadhem Al Saher, Ehab Tawfik, Mohamed Fouad, Diana Haddad, Mohamed Mounir, Latifa, Cheb Khaled, George Wassouf, Hakim, Fares Karam, Julia Boutros, and Amal Hijazi.
In 1936, Iraq Radio was established by the Iraqi Jewish musicians, Saleh and Daoud al-Kuwaity. The brothers played a pioneering role in the modern music of Iraq. Saleh was considered the father of Iraqi maqam and wrote the first song. He also composed for famous singers of that era in Iraq and the Arab world, such as Salima Murad, Afifa Iskandar, Nazem al-Ghazali, Umm Kulthum, Mohammed Abdel Wahab.

One of the main reasons for the predominance of Jewish instrumentalists in early 20th century Iraqi music was a school for blind Jewish children in Baghdad founded in the late 1920s by the &quot;qanunji&quot; (&quot;qanun player&quot;) Joseph Hawthorne (&quot;Yusef Za&#x27;arur&quot;) (Hebrew: דנדהי ללוואלד-יוסף זערור).

Salima Pasha was one of the most famous singers of the 1930s–1940s. The respect and adoration for Pasha were unusual at the time, since public performance by women was considered shameful in the region, and most female singers were recruited from brothels.

The music in Iraq began to take a more Western tone during the 1960s and 1970s, notably by Ilham Madfai, with his Western guitar stylings with traditional Iraqi music which made him a popular performer in his native country and throughout the Middle East.

==Influence of Arabic music==

The majority of musical instruments used in European medieval and classical music have roots in Arabic musical instruments that were adopted from the medieval Arab world. They include the lute, which shares an ancestor with the &quot;oud&quot;; rebec (an ancestor of the violin) from &quot;rebab&quot;, guitar from &quot;qitara&quot;, naker from &quot;naqareh&quot;, adufe from &quot;al-duff&quot;, alboka from &quot;al-buq&quot;, &quot;anafil&quot; from &quot;al-nafir&quot;, exabeba (a type of flute) from &quot;al-shabbaba&quot;, atabal (a type of bass drum) from &quot;al-tabl&quot;, atambal from &quot;al-tinbal&quot;, the balaban, castanet from &quot;kasatan&quot;, and sonajas de azófar from &quot;sunuj al-sufr&quot;.

The Arabic rabāb, also known as the spiked fiddle, is the earliest known bowed string instrument and the ancestor of all the European bowed instruments, including the rebec, the Byzantine lyra, and the violin. The Arabic oud in Arab music shares an ancestor with the European lute. The oud is also cited as a precursor to the modern guitar. The guitar has roots in the four-string oud, brought to Iberia by the Moors in the 8th century. A direct ancestor of the modern guitar is the &quot;&quot; (Moorish guitar), which was in use in Spain by the 12th century. By the 14th century, it was simply referred to as a guitar.

A number of medieval conical bore instruments were likely introduced or popularized by Arab musicians, including the xelami (from &quot;zulami&quot;).

Some scholars believe that the troubadors may have had Arabian origins, with Magda Bogin stating that the Arab poetic and musical tradition was one of several influences on European &quot;courtly love poetry&quot;. Évariste Lévi-Provençal and other scholars stated that three lines of a poem by William IX of Aquitaine were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question and produced various different translations. The medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.

The theory that the troubadour tradition was created by William after his experience of Moorish arts while fighting with the Reconquista in Spain has been championed by Ramón Menéndez Pidal and Idries Shah. George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in Spain, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that William and his father did have Spanish individuals within their extended family, and that while there is no evidence he himself knew Arabic, he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the language. Others state that the notion that William created the concept of troubadours is itself incorrect, and that his &quot;songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition.&quot;

Most scholars believe that Guido of Arezzo&#x27;s Solfège musical notation system had its origins in a Latin hymn, but others suggest that it may have had Arabic origins instead. It has been argued that the Solfège syllables (&quot;do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti&quot;) may have been derived from the syllables of an Arabic solmization system &quot;Durr-i-Mufassal&quot; (&quot;Separated Pearls&quot;) (&quot;dal, ra, mim, fa, sad, lam&quot;). This was first proposed by Meninski in his &quot;Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum&quot; (1680). However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory, and no Arabic musical manuscripts using sequences from the Arabic alphabet are known to exist. Henry George Farmer believes that there is no firm evidence on the origins of the notation, and therefore the Arabian origin theory and the hymnal origin theories are equally credible.

== Improvisational music in the Arab world ==
Ethnomusicologist Ali Jihad Racy talks about the improvisation style of music that is present in much of the Arab world. Racy discusses the regional attitudes towards improvisation music in the Middle East describing that improvisation can suggest casual or untrained or even non-professional music-making. This is held only by certain communities within the Arabic world and can differ from each region or community. Some regions look at improvisation music as the intuitive artistic ability that momentarily expresses the feeling of the player. Other groups tend to view improvisation as though it is the fulfillment of music transcending the classical maqam style or other styles of music playing. Other schools of thought on improvisation music, in the Arab world, believe that improvisation music shows a lack of understanding in musical training. Racy does not specify which groups have what views. Rather, the discussion is more focused on the idea that the Arabic music world is not in its view on improvisation in music. Other groups view improvisation as only learned through trial and error taking many years to perfect thus being a style played professionals.
=== Taqsim ===
A respected tradition in improvisation music is known as Taqsim. Taqsim music uses a maqam and improvises the form or structure of the song, which creates a cathartic experience for the listener. Further, the improvisation aspects go beyond the form and are expressed in the quartertones of the song. This tradition historically was performed as a chant. Now it is used by performers on the oud/ud, violin, or nay, a type of flute. This style of improvisation is known for the effects it can conjure up in a listener. Listeners may laugh, cry, and shout at different points in the performance due to the emotions evoked by the music.

=== Improvisation in Chant ===
* A certain type of Arabic chant is in the melismatic style and is both long and highly ornamented. It has specific elements of free rhythm and improvisation as part of its structure. Syllabic chant is isochronic and is accompanied by an al-durbkkeh (a percussion instrument or drum) while being relatively fast in its nature. There is usually participation from the listeners who contribute through the clapping of hands to the rhythm. 
* Ethnomusicologist Jargy tells of another type of improvisation music in which he uses the name &quot;Median&quot;&quot;.&quot; This music is a combination of the syllabic chant and the melismatic style. Median improvisation music uses more extreme improvisation methods and expands the boundaries of improvisation and is usually faster than syllabic chant. 
* The last improvisation style discussed by Jargy is the recitative style that is sung predominantly by women and is built on aural tradition.

==Genres==

===Franco-Arabic===
Franco-Arabic music is a form of music similar to modern Arabic Pop. The genre was popularized by artists such as Dalida from Egypt, Sammy Clark from Lebanon and Aldo from Australia. 
Franco-Arabic music includes a variety of languages, including Arabic, Italian, French Arabic and English.

===Arabic R&amp;B, reggae, and hip hop===

A rise of Arabic R&amp;B, reggae and hip hop has been taking place since the early 2010s. These songs usually feature a rapper in a traditional Arab pop song (such as Ishtar&#x27;s song &#x27;Habibi Sawah&#x27;). The Moroccan singer Elam Jay developed a contemporary version of the Gnawa genre that is fused with R&amp;B, named &quot;Gnawitone Styla&quot;. Another variation of contemporary Gnawa played in Morocco was introduced by the band Darga. Based in Casablanca, the group utilises a mix Gnawa and Reggae in some of their songs.

Political Reggae artists such as TootArd from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights started gaining popularity in Palestine in 2011 after the release of a song about the Arab Spring (mainly the Tunisian revolution), called &quot;The Green Revolution&quot;. It was sung by them and an ensemble of Palestinian artists, most notable among them being Mahmoud Jrere of DAM. Another notable Arab artist is Shadia Mansour, who is a Palestinian British rapper known as &quot;The First Lady of Arab Hip Hop. Much of her music focuses on the Palestinian cause.

Starting in the 2010s, some artists such as Darine began to utilise fully R&amp;B and reggae beats in their songs. This has been met with mixed reviews and mixed commercial performance.

===Arabic electronica===
A combination of electronic music with traditional Middle Eastern instruments has been popularized by Richii with songs like &quot;Ana Lubnaneyoun&quot;.

===Arabic jazz===
Arabic jazz using jazz instruments has become popular. Musicians like Samir Suroor began to play the saxophone in the &quot;oriental&quot; style. Abdel Halim Hafez, Kadim Al Sahir and Rida Al Abdallah also play in this style. The first mainstream jazz elements were incorporated into Arabic music by the Rahbani brothers. Fairuz&#x27;s later work was almost exclusively made up of jazz songs, composed by her son Ziad Rahbani. Ziad Rahbani also pioneered today&#x27;s oriental jazz movement, to which singers including Rima Khcheich, Salma El Mosfi, and (on occasion) Latifa adhere. We can also find a lot of jazz music in Mohamed Mounir&#x27;s songs starting from his first album Alemony Eneeki in 1977, and he is considered to be the King of Arabic Jazz and Arabic Music generally. Another notable performer of this genre is the Palestinian singer Reem Kelani who blends jazz with Arabic music, both in her own compositions and in her arrangements of traditional songs.

Arabic Jazz has met many new kinds of composition since the end of the 20th century:
* Modal forms with Anouar Brahem and Rabih Abou Khalil
* Mixed electric sound experiences with Dhafer Youssef and Kamal Musallam
* New pop jazz styles with Titi Robin and Toufic Farroukh
* Other acoustic youth experiences with Hamdi Makhlouf, Amine &amp; Hamza M&#x27;raihi and Jasser Haj Youssef

===Arabic rock===
There have been many Arab rock bands along the years that fused rock, metal and alternative rock sounds with traditional Arab instruments.

Arabic rock has been gaining attention in the Middle East since the early 2000s, with bands such as Tanjaret Daghet, JadaL, Kayan, Autostrad, El Morabba3, Akher Zapheer, The Wanton Bishops, Mashrou&#x27; Leila, Adonis and Meen, Cairokee, Massar Egbari, Sahara, Wyvern, Cartoon Killerz, Khalas, Chaos and Acrassicauda all gaining popularity.

Recently, there has been a new wave of bands emerging in the underground scene across the Arab world. These include Shaghaf, Khayal, Sada That, Code Masr and Hawas of Egypt and Ayloul of Lebanon.

==Musical regions==

The world of modern Arabic music has long been dominated by musical trends that have emerged from Cairo, Egypt. The city is generally considered one of the important cultural centers in the Arab world. Innovations in popular music via the influence of other regional styles have also abounded from Morocco to Saudi Arabia. In recent years, Beirut has become an important city where singers can fluently sing in various Arabic Dialects. Other regional styles that have enjoyed popular music status throughout the Arab world, including:

==Sacred and Art music==

===Sacred music===
Arabic religious music includes Jewish (Pizmonim and Baqashot), Christian, and Islamic music. However, Islamic music is structurally equivalent to Arabic secular music, while Christian Arab music has been influenced by Syriac Orthodox, Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Anglican, Coptic, and Maronite church music.

===Art music===
Secular art musical genres include maqam al-iraqi, andalusi nubah, muwashshah, Fijiri songs, qasidah, layali, mawwal, taqsim, bashraf, sama&#x27;i, tahmilah, dulab, sawt, and liwa.

==Characteristics of Arabic music==

Much of Arabic music is characterized by an emphasis on melody and rhythm, as opposed to harmony. There are some genres of Arabic music that are polyphonic, but typically, Arabic music is homophonic.

Habib Hassan Touma submits that there are five components that characterize Arabic music:
# The Arab tone system; that is, a musical tuning system that relies on specific interval structures and was invented by al-Farabi in the 10th century
# Rhythmic-temporal structures that produce a rich variety of rhythmic patterns, known as &quot;awzan&quot; or &quot;weight&quot;, that are used to accompany metered vocal and instrumental genres, to accent or give them form.
# A number of musical instruments that are found throughout the Arab world that represent a standardized tone system, are played with generally standardized performance techniques, and display similar details in construction and design.
# Specific social contexts that produce sub-categories of Arabic music, or musical genres that can be broadly classified as urban (music of the city inhabitants), rural (music of the country inhabitants), or Bedouin (music of the desert inhabitants)...&quot;
# An Arab musical mentality, &quot;responsible for the esthetic homogeneity of the tonal-spatial and rhythmic-temporal structures throughout the Arab world whether composed or improvised, instrumental or vocal, secular or sacred.&quot;

===Maqam system===
The basis of Arabic music is the maqam (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same. The tonic note, dominant note, and ending note (unless modulation occurs) are generally determined by the maqam used. Arabic maqam theory as described in literature over the ages names between 90 and 110 maqams, that are grouped into larger categories known as fasilah. Fasilah are groupings of maqams whose first four primary pitches are shared in common.

====Ajnas====
The maqam consists of at least two &quot;ajnas&quot;, or scale segments. &quot;Ajnas&quot; is the plural form of &quot;jins&quot;, which in Arabic comes from the Latin word &quot;genus&quot;, meaning &quot;type&quot;. In practice, a jins is either a trichord (three notes), a tetrachord (four notes), or a pentachord (five notes). A maqam usually covers only one octave (usually two ajnas), but can cover more. Like the melodic minor scale, some maqamat use different ajnas when descending and ascending. Due to continuous innovation and the emergence of new ajnas, and because most music scholars have not reached consensus on the subject, a solid figure for the total number of ajnas in use is uncertain. In practice, however, most musicians would agree there are at least eight major ajnas: &quot;rast&quot;, &quot;bayat&quot;, &quot;sikah&quot;, &quot;hijaz&quot;, &quot;saba&quot;, &quot;kurd&quot;, &quot;nahawand&quot;, and &quot;ajam&quot;, and commonly used variants such as &quot;nakriz&quot;, &quot;athar kurd&quot;, &quot;sikah beladi&quot;, &quot;saba zamzama&quot;. For example, &quot;Mukhalif&quot; is a rare jins (in the Sikah) family used almost exclusively in Iraq, and it is not used in combination with other ajnas.

===Microtones in Arabic music===
Unlike the tradition of Western music, Arabic music contains microtones, which are notes that lie between notes in the Western chromatic scale. While notes in the chromatic scale are separated by semitones (or half steps), notes in Arabic music can be separated by quarter tones. In some treatments of theory, the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, but according to Yūsuf Shawqī (1969), fewer tones are used in practice.

Additionally, in 1932, at the Cairo Congress of Arab Music held in Cairo, Egypt—and attended by such Western luminaries as Béla Bartók and Henry George Farmer—experiments were done that determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale. Furthermore, the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq).

====Regional scales====
As a result of these findings, the following recommendation was issued: &quot;The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are...&quot; Both in modern practice, and evident in recorded music over the course of the last century, several differently-tuned Es in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale are used, that vary according to the types of maqams and ajnas used, and the region in which they are used.

====Practical treatment====
Musicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as quarter tones, using &quot;half-flat&quot; or &quot;half-sharp&quot; as a designation for the in-between flats and sharps, for ease of nomenclature. Performance and teaching of the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam is usually done by ear. It should also be added, in reference to Habib Hassan Touma&#x27;s comment above, that these quarter tones are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the Well-Tempered Klavier. The most commonly used quarter tones are on E (between E and E), A, B, D, F (between F and F), and C.

===Vocal traditions===
Arab classical music is known for its famed virtuoso singers, who sing long, elaborately ornamented, melismatic tunes, coloraturas unheard in any other musical genres and are known for driving audiences into ecstasy. Its traditions come from pre-Islamic times, when female singing slaves entertained the wealthy, inspired warriors on the battlefield with their rajaz poetry, and performed at weddings. A vast number of female Arab vocalists are mezzo-sopranos who cultivate darker and richer tones than generic Soprano voices.

===Instruments and ensembles===

The prototypical Arabic music ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the takht, and includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the &#x27;oud, qānūn, rabab, ney, violin (introduced in the 1840s or 50s), riq and dumbek. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the chalghi, includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and santur—accompanied by the riq and dumbek. The Arab world has incorporated instruments from the West, including the electric guitar, cello, double bass and oboe, and incorporated influences from jazz and other foreign musical styles.

The singers have remained the stars, however, especially after the development of the recording and film industry in the 1920s in Cairo. These singing celebrities are (or were) the biggest stars in Arabic classic music, they include Farid Al Attrache, Asmahan, Abdel Halim Hafez, Sayed Darwish, Mohamed Abdel Wahab, Warda Al-Jazairia, Wadih El Safi, Fairuz, Sabah, and Umm Kulthum.

== Research and documentation of Arabic music ==
Even though musical traditions in the Arab world have been handed down orally, Arab scholars Al-Kindi, Abulfaraj or Al-Farabi and later Safi al-Din published treatises in Arabic music since at least the 9th century AD. In 1932, the first Congress of Arab Music was held in Cairo, where scholarship about the past, present and future of Arabic music was presented both from Western as well as Arab experts. The results were later documented, both in writing as well as in the form of audio recordings.

Research on Arabic music is a focus of departments of ethnomusicology at universities worldwide, and the global interest in World music has led to a growing number of studies and re-issues of historic recordings by independent researchers or private companies.

Making use of digital archives for texts, pictures and sounds, detailed information on the history of Arabic music is also made accessible over the Internet. The Lebanese foundation AMMAR, for example, is committed to the preservation and dissemination of traditional Arab music and has published a host of historical documents.

<text>The Battle of Fei River, also known as the Battle of Feishui (), took place in the autumn of 383 AD in China, where forces of the Di-led Former Qin dynasty were decisively defeated by the outnumbered army of the Eastern Jin dynasty. The location of the battle, the Fei River, no longer exists but is believed to have flowed through modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui, near the Huai River. The battle is considered to be one of the most significant and pivotal battles in Chinese history, as it ensured the survival of the Eastern Jin and Han-ruled regimes in South China. In the aftermath of the battle, the Former Qin fell into a massive civil war, resulting in its eventual collapse, ensuring the survival of Eastern Jin and subsequent Han-ruled regimes south of the Yangtze River.

== Background ==
The state of Former Qin, led by ethnic Di () tribesmen, rose rapidly from a string of successes in the 350s. Fu Jiān, the nephew of the founder Fu Jiàn, was a vigorous leader of tremendous drive and ambition. In 370 he conquered the state of Former Yan and in 373 seized modern Sichuan and Chongqing from Jin. In 379, the strategically important city of Xiangyang, gateway to the Middle Yangtze, fell to Qin. By 381, he had conquered all of north China and was preparing for an invasion of the south.

In May 383, a Jin army of 100,000 commanded by Huan Chong attempted to recover Xiangyang but was driven off by a Qin relief column of 50,000 men. In response, Fu Jiān ordered a general mobilization against Jin: 6 of every 10 able-bodied men were conscripted, and 30,000 elite guards () were gathered. In August 383, Fu Jiān sent his brother, Fu Rong, the Duke of Yangping (who had opposed the campaign), with an army of 300,000 as the advance force. Later that month, Fu Jiān marched with his army of 270,000 cavalry and 600,000 infantry from Chang&#x27;an. In September, Fu Jiān reached Xiangcheng. Separate columns were to push downstream from Sichuan, but the main offensive would occur against the city of Shouchun on the Huai River. Emperor Xiaowu of Jin hurriedly made preparations for defense. He gave Huan Chong responsibility for the defense of the Middle Yangtze. The pressing defense of the Huai River was given to Xie Shi () and Xie Xuan and the elite 80,000-strong Beifu Army Prime Minister Xie An oversaw overall strategy.

Huan Chong was deeply worried and sent three thousand elite soldiers into the city to support the capital, but was resolutely stopped by Xie An, saying: &quot;The way the imperial court will deal with it has been decided, there is no shortage of soldiers and weapons, please stay in the west, just in case.&quot; Huan Chong sighed at his subordinates and said, &quot;Xie An has the strength to live in the imperial court, but he is not familiar with the means of leading troops to fight. Now that the great enemy is coming, they are still playing to their heart&#x27;s content, they will talk big, and they can only send young people (Xie Xuan) who have never fought to resist, coupled with the lack of numbers and weak troops, the end of the country has long been known, and we are about to be ruled by barbarians!&quot; Later, the Jin army on the eastern front defeated the Qin army, and Huan Chong was ashamed to learn the news, and died of an attack of illness at the age of 57.

===Former Qin Army===
Fu Jiān&#x27;s force was composed of many smaller armies levied from the conquered northern territories, along with cavalry drawn from the nomadic peoples of the north (the Xianbei and Xiongnu). Most men had little or no loyalty to the Former Qin, and many were forced to join or joined only because of military rations and pay. Many battalions had problems following orders as instructed by their commanding officers. Fu was warned of the poor training of his heterogeneous army, but instead chose to rely on the vast number of men that made up the army, saying, &quot;My army is so huge that if all the men throw their whips into the Yangtze, its flow will be stopped&quot; ().

===Jin Army===
Xie Xuan&#x27;s Beifu army was drawn from the militarized settlements of powerful local families, with officers bringing along their own hereditary troops. This army underwent significant training and could be considered a professional military unit.

== Battle ==
In October 383, the Former Qin forces under Fu Rong captured the important Jin city of Shouyang (, in modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui). Fu Jiān, seeing the possibility of achieving a quick victory, left his main force at Xiangcheng and led 8,000 light cavalry to rendezvous with Fu Rong. Fu Jiān sent captured Jin official Zhu Xu as a messenger to try to persuade Xie Shi to surrender. Instead, Zhu tipped off Xie Shi to the fact that the entire Former Qin force had not yet arrived and that he should try to defeat the advanced Former Qin forces to cripple the Former Qin&#x27;s campaign. At Zhu&#x27;s suggestion, Xie Xuan and Liu Laozhi () led 5,000 elite troops to engage the advanced Former Qin force, scoring a devastating victory, killing 15,000 men. Afterwards, Jin troops were lined up in a wide formation to give the illusion that the Jin forces could match Former Qin&#x27;s manpower. Because of the early minor defeats and the Jin formation, Fu Jiān overestimated the amount of Jin forces.

In November 383, the Former Qin troops set up camp west of the Fei River. The Jin forces stopped east of the Fei and could not advance. Xie Xuan sent a messenger to Fu Rong, suggesting that the Former Qin forces retreat slightly west to allow Jin troops to cross the Fei River so that the two armies could engage. Most Former Qin generals opposed that plan, since maneuvering such a large army in that manner was too complicated for the benefits that might be obtained, especially with so many poorly trained troops. Fu Jiān overruled them, however, planning to attack the Jin army as it was crossing the river to seize a tactical advantage, as the Jin would be split in two. Fu Rong agreed and ordered a retreat.

The Jin&#x27;s tactics of ambush and bribery now paid off. Many soldiers in the Former Qin army began to wonder why a sudden retreat order was given. Already retreating and demoralized, the Former Qin army went into a panic when Zhu Xu raised a cry of &quot;the Qin army has been defeated&quot; and it was routed. Xie Xuan and generals Xie Yan () and Huan Yi crossed the river and launched a major assault. The &quot;Qin is Defeated&quot; rumor spread like wildfire, and chaos followed. Fu Rong personally tried to halt the retreat and reorganize his troops, but his horse suddenly fell and he was killed by advancing Jin troops.

The Jin generals noticed the chaotic footprints and wheel marks and declared that the Former Qin army was not in an organized retreat but was indeed in total disarray. The Jin soldiers continued their pursuit, and the entire Former Qin force collapsed.
A large amount of food and supplies were abandoned as Former Qin soldiers tried to escape with their lives. In the ensuing retreat and pursuit, an estimated 70-80% of the Former Qin troops died from combat, starvation and exposure to the elements.

==Aftermath==

The Jin army defeated the overwhelming Former Qin forces with only minor casualties. The Jin had routed and killed most of the escaping soldiers of the Former Qin army, greatly weakening the pool of troops from which the Former Qin could draw. Fu Jiān&#x27;s forces were not able to be reorganized, even after he eventually withdrew to Luoyang under the protection of Murong Chui, whose 30,000-man army was one of the few that did not collapse.

Meanwhile, agrarian rebellions arose after news of the defeat at Fei River. Murong Chui used this opportunity to ask Fu Jiān to let him try to lead an army to pressure the rebels in the eastern empire back into submission. Instead, Murong Chui himself rebelled in early 384, which started a chain reaction of many Xianbei and Qiang uprisings. The Former Qin capital Chang&#x27;an would fall in 385 to the Xianbei forces of Western Yan, and Fu Jiān himself would die later that year at the hands of his former general Yao Chang, the founder of Later Qin. While Former Qin would last until 394, it would never regain its power and glory. In addition, after the battle, Jin forces advanced to the Yellow River and recovered much of the Chinese heartland, forming a basis for Liu Yu&#x27;s expeditions and the Southern and Northern dynasties period that would follow soon afterward.

This battle is famous not only because of its significance in history but also because it demonstrated the importance of troop training, morale, loyalty and organized battle command. The battle was also significant in that it ensured South China would remain independent until 589 AD, when North China was again under a Han Chinese regime, the Sui dynasty.

<text>Lincoln Financial Field is an American football stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is the home stadium of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL) and the Temple Owls football team of Temple University. The stadium is located in South Philadelphia on Pattison Avenue between 11th and South Darien streets alongside I-95. It is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex and has a seating capacity of 67,594.

The stadium opened on August 3, 2003, after two years of construction that began on May 7, 2001, replacing Veterans Stadium, which opened in 1971 and served as the home field for both the Eagles and Philadelphia Phillies through 2002 and 2003, respectively. While total seating capacity is similar to that of Veterans Stadium, the new stadium includes double the number of luxury and wheelchair-accessible seats and more modern services. The field&#x27;s construction included several LED video displays and more than of LED ribbon boards.

Naming rights were sold in June 2002 to the Lincoln Financial Group, for a sum of $139.6 million over 21 years. The City of Philadelphia and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cumulatively contributed approximately $188 million in public funding to the stadium construction. Additional construction funding was raised from the sale of stadium builder&#x27;s licenses, which are necessary to purchase season tickets for some of the stadium&#x27;s best seating levels. The City of Philadelphia owns the stadium due to the sizable public contribution, but the Eagles lease the stadium from the city as the sole operator of the stadium, giving them full control over the stadium&#x27;s operations.

The Army–Navy football game is frequently played at the stadium due to Philadelphia being located halfway between both service academies, the stadium being able to house the large crowds in attendance, and the historic nature of the city. Temple University&#x27;s Division I college football team also plays their home games at Lincoln Financial Field, paying the Eagles $3 million a year to do so as of February 2020. The Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer have played exhibition games here against high-profile international clubs when their stadium Subaru Park does not provide adequate seating. The stadium also plays host to several soccer games each year and will host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It has also played host to the NCAA lacrosse national championship five times: 2005, 2006, 2013, 2019, and 2023.

== Features ==

The design of the stadium is meant to evoke the team&#x27;s namesake eagle with wing like canopies above the east and west stands and the Eagle&#x27;s Nest balcony beyond the north end-zone. The team&#x27;s primary eagle logo is patterned in the dark green seats of the upper deck of the east and west stands. Three open corners of the stadium provide fans with views of the Philadelphia skyline and the field. The exterior of the stadium uses a brick façade to reference the historic brick architecture present throughout Philadelphia, while the exposed steel structure evokes the city&#x27;s bridges and future.

In late spring 2013, the Eagles announced that there would be some major upgrades to Lincoln Financial Field over the next two years. The total project estimate was valued at over $125 million. The upgrades included seating expansion, two new HD video boards, upgraded amenities, WiFi, and two new connecting bridges for upper levels. These upgrades were decided upon after research from season ticket holders, advisory boards, and fan focus groups. The majority of these changes, including WiFi (which would accommodate 45,000 users and have coverage over the entire stadium), were completed by the 2013 home opener. The upgraded sound systems and video boards were finished for the 2014 season.

== Suites and lounges ==

There are 172 Luxury Suites at Lincoln Financial Field. They range in capacity from 12 to 40 people and cost $75,000 to $300,000 per year or $20,000 for a single game rental. The suites are located in six separate areas throughout the stadium. There are 3,040 luxury suite seats in total.

There are two exclusive club lounges in the stadium. The lounge on the west side is the &quot;Hyundai Club&quot; and the one on the east side is the &quot;Tork Club&quot;. Suite holders and club seat holders have access to these 2 lounges. There are a total of 10,828 club seats in the stadium. These club seats feature some unique benefits above and beyond the lounges. One major benefit is the lounges open hours before the event, in most cases 2–4 hours. The lounges also have multiple full-service bars in them. The seats in the club level are padded, and there is also a wait staff present to serve food and drinks.

== Parking ==
There are numerous parking lots surrounding Lincoln Financial Field. The parking assignments may change depending on other activities in the area on a particular day. According to the stadium&#x27;s website, all lots cost visitors $45 and $90 for an oversized vehicle. Tailgating is allowed in all lots except for T-X lots. The majority of the lots are public cash lots.

While the Eagles did not ban the act entirely, they did ban the use of tables and tents as well as the purchasing of more than one parking spot per vehicle. Prices were also doubled to $40 for RVs and buses, and $20 for cars. Fans have been reported to be upset.

== College football ==

Lincoln Financial Field is the home field for Temple University football.

<doc id="251762" wikidata="Q918151" url="?curid=251762" title="Hard Rock Cafe">
<text>Hard Rock Cafe, Inc. is a chain of theme bar-restaurants, memorabilia shops, casinos and museums founded in 1971 by Isaac Tigrett and Peter Morton in London. In 1979, the cafe began covering its walls with rock and roll memorabilia, a tradition which expanded to others in the chain. In 2007, Hard Rock Cafe International (USA), Inc. was sold to the Seminole Tribe of Florida and was headquartered in Orlando, Florida, until April 2018, when the corporate offices were relocated to Davie, Florida. As of July 2018, Hard Rock International has venues in 74 countries, including 172 bar or cafe-restaurants, 37 hotels, and four casinos.

== History ==

=== Cafe-restaurants ===

The first Hard Rock Cafe opened on June 14, 1971, at 150 Old Park Lane, Hyde Park, London, under the ownership of two Americans, Isaac Tigrett and Peter Morton. Hard Rock initially had an eclectic decor, but it later started to display memorabilia. In 1978, a second location was opened in Toronto, Canada.

The chain began to expand worldwide in 1982 when Morton opened Hard Rock Cafes in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, and Tigrett opened locations in Jackson, Tennessee, New York, Dallas, Boston, Washington, D.C., Orlando as well as Paris (opened in 1991, closed in 2024) and Berlin. Hard Rock Cafe locations in the US vary from smaller, more tourist-driven markets (Biloxi, Pigeon Forge, Key West) to large metropolises (Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York City, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C.).

Hard Rock Cafe typically does not franchise cafe locations in the United States. All U.S. cafes are corporate owned and operated, except for cafes in Tampa and in the (now closed) Four Winds New Buffalo casino. However, in the transition of the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel property, originally owned and then later sold to Rank by founder Peter Morton, Morton retained hotel naming rights west of the Mississippi. When Morton sold his Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel to the Morgans Hotel Group, he also sold those naming rights, which then gave rise to two US franchised hotels (without cafes) in Albuquerque and Tulsa. (The Albuquerque hotel no longer pays for the Hard Rock rights and reverted to its former name in June 2013.) Additional casino hotels franchised from Morgan&#x27;s were subsequently opened in Sioux City, Iowa and Vancouver, Canada.
A Hard Rock Cafe exists in Empire, Colorado, which was established in 1934 that is not part of the chain.

In 1990, The Rank Group, a London-based leisure company, acquired Mecca Leisure Group and continued expansion of the concept in its geographic territory. Rank went on to purchase &quot;Hard Rock America&quot; from Peter Morton as well as &quot;Hard Rock Canada&quot; from Nick Bitove. After the completion of these acquisitions, Rank gained worldwide control of the brand. In March 2007, the Seminole Tribe of Florida acquired &quot;Hard Rock Cafe International, Inc.&quot; and other related entities from Rank for US$965 million.

In 2008, anonymous members of the wait staff in London criticized the business because of its practice of paying them less than half the official minimum wage in the UK, with the business allocating the tips to staff wages, thus bringing their salaries within the minimum wage requirements. Most customers, it was argued, do not realize that they are subsidizing a low wage when they give the tip.

=== Music memorabilia ===

HRC is known for its collection of rock-and-roll memorabilia. The cafes solicit donations of music memorabilia but also purchase a number of items at auctions around the world, including autographed guitars, costumes from world tours and rare photographs; these are often to be found mounted on cafe walls. The collection began in 1979 with an un-signed Red Fender Lead II guitar from Eric Clapton, who was a regular at the first restaurant in London. Clapton wanted management to hang the guitar over his regular seat in order to lay claim to that spot, and they obliged. This prompted Pete Townshend of The Who to give one of his guitars, also un-signed with the note &quot;Mine&#x27;s as good as his! Love, Pete.&quot; Hard Rock&#x27;s archive includes over 80,000 items, and is the largest private collection of Rock and Roll memorabilia in the world. Marquee pieces from the collection were briefly displayed in a Hard Rock museum named &quot;The Vault&quot; in Orlando, Florida from January 2003 until September 2004. After the closure, items were distributed to various restaurant locations. The London Vault remains open and free to visitors, located in the retail Rock Shop of the original cafe.

The Hard Rock Café is also in possession of a Bedford VAL three axle coach. The vehicle was completely refurbished. It is currently displayed in the US, but makes regular appearances in events in the UK, especially at the original Hard Rock Cafe in London. In 2001, a competition was run to win the bus, but it was never given away and remained with the cafe. On June 10, 2021, Hard Rock announced Lionel Messi as its Hard Rock brand ambassador as the company celebrated its 50th anniversary.

== Expansion into other businesses ==

=== Casinos and hotels ===


In 1995, Peter Morton spent $80 million to open the Hard Rock Hotel near the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. A subsequent $100 million expansion in 1999 nearly doubled the hotel&#x27;s capacity.

In May 2006, Morton sold the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino, Las Vegas to Morgans Hotel Group for $770 million, including the rights to the &quot;Hard Rock Hotel&quot; brand west of the Mississippi, including Texas, California, Australia, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The hotel began another expansion in 2007 at a cost of $750 million. The project added 875 rooms in two towers and expanded meeting space. In March 2011, Morgans surrendered control of the property to partner Brookfield Asset Management, citing the high debt on the property in the face of the economic downturn. In April 2018, the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas was sold to Richard Branson with plans to renovate the property under the Virgin Hotels brand; Virgin Hotels Las Vegas debuted in March 2021.

Today, the Seminole Tribe of Florida owns and operates all units except the Sioux City, Tulsa, Biloxi, and Vancouver properties. In 2004, Hard Rock International and Sol Melia Hotels and Resorts launched Lifestar Hoteles España SL, a joint venture that intended to manage Europe&#x27;s first Hard Rock Hotel in Madrid, but it was never opened as a Hard Rock property upon the dissolution of the joint venture in 2007. The other joint venture hotels are in Chicago, New York, and San Diego (the San Diego property includes Hard Rock condominiums). Hard Rock also operates hotels and resorts in Orlando, Florida (a joint venture with Loews Hotels); Bali, Indonesia; and Pattaya, Thailand, (a joint venture with Ong Beng Seng/Hotel Properties Limited). Hard Rock International continues to expand internationally (including hotels, casinos, resorts, and condominiums) through several joint ventures (Becker Ventures, Ong Beng Seng/Hotel Properties Limited and Loews Hotels), including hotels in Chicago, Bali, Orlando, Penang, San Diego, Singapore, and planned openings in Abu Dhabi, Cancun, Dubai, Hungary, Panama, Punta Cana and Puerto Vallarta, as well as hotel-casinos in Hollywood, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Catoosa, Oklahoma, just northeast of Tulsa.
(The Hard Rock Casino in Biloxi, MS is owned by Twin River Management Group, Inc.) Opened on January 20, 2010, in Singapore at Sentosa, the Hard Rock Hotel at Resorts World Sentosa is owned by the Genting Group.

The Hotel Zoso in Palm Springs, California was converted into a 160-room Hard Rock Hotel and opened in 2014. It subsequently closed. A location in Atlantic City, New Jersey was planned in 2010, but those plans were canceled in 2012; however, in 2017, they acquired from Icahn Enterprises the closed Trump Taj Mahal, which in 2018 was reopened as Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City. All-inclusive resorts operate under the Hard Rock brand in the Dominican Republic and Mexico. In 2013, the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park opened as a joint slot machine and track venture near Cleveland, Ohio. Then in early 2019, it was announced that JACK Cincinnati Casino in Cincinnati was sold for $745 million to Vici Properties and Hard Rock International, with Vici acquiring the land and buildings for $558 million and Hard Rock buying the operating business for $187 million. Hard Rock would lease the casino from Vici for $43 million per year, and would rebrand it as Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati.

Canada had numerous restaurants but many of them closed, notably the one at Yonge-Dundas Square in Toronto in May 2017, which had been the chain&#x27;s second location, leaving just two in that country, Niagara Falls, Ontario, and the Hard Rock Casino in Coquitlam, B.C.

In Argentina, the first Hard Rock Cafe opened in 1995, located in Recoleta, Buenos Aires. In 2016, a location opened in Ushuaia, in the province of Tierra del Fuego, with another being opened in the city of Puerto Iguazu in 2024.

In 2015, Hard Rock announced a new hotel in Bogotá, Colombia, which will open in 2019. The company had plans to open in the biggest financial district in Colombia, the &quot;Centro Internacional&quot;, but it revised those plans. The hotel will be located in the exclusive &quot;Zona Rosa de Bogotá&quot;, home of luxury boutiques.

In July 2019, Hard Rock International announced plans for a casino in Rockford, Illinois, about 75 miles west of Chicago along I-90. Two other proposals were made for the city&#x27;s lone casino license, but the city council only recommended the Hard Rock proposal to the Illinois Gaming Board, who will decide which site will get the license. The temporary casino, named Rockford Casino-A Hard Rock Opening Act, opened on November 10, 2021. It features a Rock Shop, Hard Rock memorabilia, slots, and two restaurants. The permanent casino is planned to open within two years and feature a Hard Rock Cafe, live music venue, 90 foot tall replica of a Rick Nielson guitar, and will be a full-fledge Hard Rock Casino.

In November 2019, Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Sacramento at Fire Mountain opened adjacent to the Toyota Amphitheatre near Wheatland, California. Also in November, Hard Rock announced a new hotel in São Paulo, Brazil, in the heart of popular Paulista Avenue.

In January 2021, it was announced that Hard Rock will be opening a new hotel in London, Ontario, Canada, with a 353-room hotel slated to finish construction in 2025. It will be located in the 100 Kellogg Lane complex.

In May 2021, a $300 million Hard Rock Casino location opened in Gary, Indiana about 35 minutes east of Chicago. Branded as Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana, the location includes memorabilia from local natives Jackson 5 and a 1,950-seat Hard Rock Live performance hall.

In December 2021, Hard Rock purchased The Mirage, from MGM Resorts for $1.075 billion. The deal closed in December 2022. The Las Vegas Strip property will be completely renovated, but was permitted to keep using &quot;The Mirage&quot; name for up to 3 years. A new 36-story hotel tower in the shape of a guitar, like the one at the Seminole Hard Rock, will be added. After renovations, the plan is to reopen the hotel under the name Hard Rock Las Vegas in 2027.

Hard Rock is one of multiple bidders who are bidding for one of three casino licenses for Downstate New York. Hard Rock is looking to build an integrated resort adjacent to Citi Field in Flushing, New York.

=== Hard Rock Park ===

In March 2006, Hard Rock Cafe International announced that it had licensed the &quot;Hard Rock&quot; name to HRP Myrtle Beach Operations, LLC, to design, build, and operate a $400 million theme park called Hard Rock Park. Hard Rock Park opened on April 15, 2008, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The park was expected to draw an estimated 30,000 visitors per day, promised to create more than 3,000 jobs, and was billed as the largest single investment in South Carolina&#x27;s history. It planned to feature a large concert arena and six zones with more than 40 attractions. HRP Myrtle Beach Operations, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 on September 25, 2008. The company hoped to re-open in 2009 after restructuring. On January 2, 2009, after failing to attract a buyer with a minimum $35 million bid for over two months, Hard Rock Park asked a Delaware Bankruptcy Court to convert the filing to Chapter 7 triggering immediate liquidation of assets to pay off creditors, and closing the park.

New owners renamed the venue Freestyle Music Park and planned to reopen retaining a music-theme, but without the Hard Rock name, by Memorial Day, 2009. The park only operated one additional year and then closed, due to poor attendance.

=== Stadiums ===

In August 2016, it was reported that the Miami Dolphins&#x27; stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida would be renamed Hard Rock Stadium. Super Bowl LIV was held there on February 2, 2020. The stadium has hosted the Super Bowl on six occasions and will host seven matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The Hard Rock Club is a sponsored bar at the Canadian Tire Centre, with Hard Rock branding and memorabilia. The stadium formerly housed Ottawa&#x27;s first Hard Rock Café when it opened as The Palladium on January 15, 1996, and for many years when it was known as the Corel Centre. The café closed on August 8, 2002, and was replaced with the Frank Finnigan&#x27;s restaurant. Since October 17, 2013, the restaurant is known as Chek Point, and is sponsored by SportChek. The Hard Rock Club bar was announced on October 9, 2018, and opened near the former Hard Rock Café. The bar features memorabilia from over a dozen artists, restaurant-style seating, and dedicated stadium seating.

== Acquisition by the Seminole Tribe of Florida ==

On December 7, 2006, Rank sold its Hard Rock business to the Seminole Tribe of Florida for $965 million. Included in the deal were 124 Hard Rock Cafes, four Hard Rock Hotels, two Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hotels, two Hard Rock Live! concert venues, and stakes in three unbranded hotels. Rank retained the Hard Rock Casino in London, and rebranded it the G Casino Piccadilly. The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas was also not part of the deal, as Peter Morton sold it to Morgans Hotel Group in May 2006.

The final takeover was mired in controversy, due to a payment clause in a contract with one casino developer, Power Plant Entertainment. Power Plant and the Seminoles announced a settlement in April 2007 which both sides called equitable. On January 8, 2007, Rank shareholders approved the Seminoles&#x27; $965 million offer. The Tribe announced it had finalized the deal on March 11, 2007.

On June 22, 2008, the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood began &quot;Vegas-style&quot; table gambling in addition to the Class II slots already in operation. To win approval for the table games, which were barred under Florida law, the Seminole Tribe paid the State of Florida $100 million as part of a 25-year pact signed by Governor Charlie Crist. On July 3, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the governor&#x27;s agreement was unconstitutional, but table games continue to operate because the Federal Department of the Interior approved the now-invalid pact with the state.

A similar issue stemmed with sports betting in Florida under the Hard Rock Bet app. Through a new gaming compact, the Seminole Tribe began to offer off-grounds sports betting. Once live in 2021, lawsuits caused the Seminole Tribe to halt operations. Relaunching in November 2023 for returning players, the Seminole Tribe of Florida now operates online sports betting too.

== Things of interest ==
Side 1 of The Doors&#x27; 1970 album Morrison Hotel is titled Hard Rock Cafe. A café of that name in Los Angeles (now closed) is pictured on the back of the album. In 1977 album Simple Things, Carole King wrote the song Hard Rock Café. In her autobiography A Natural Woman, she reports that she was inspired by a bar in downtown Los Angeles and a small restaurant in Idaho with the same name. At the time, she was not aware of the similarity in name to the restaurant chain. HRC founders Morton and Tigrett were allegedly inspired to give the name by the same bar in Los Angeles. Olivia Molina sang the German version of the song. Until February 2017, there was a café in Heidelberg called Hard Rock Café, but it did not belong to the group; after a series of court cases, the restaurant had to change its name.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hard Rock Cafe refused to withdraw from the Russian market. An April 28, 2022 study by Yale University, intended to identify how companies were reacting to the invasion, placed Hard Rock Cafe in the &quot;Buying Time&quot; category, meaning &quot;Holding Off New Investments/Development: companies postponing future planned investment/development/marketing while continuing substantive business&quot;. The only Hard Rock Cafe in Moscow was closed in October 2022.

<doc id="251764" wikidata="Q310549" url="?curid=251764" title="Mass in B minor">
<text>The Mass in B minor (), BWV 232, is an extended setting of the Mass ordinary by Johann Sebastian Bach. The composition was completed in 1749, the year before the composer&#x27;s death, and was to a large extent based on earlier work, such as a Sanctus Bach had composed in 1724. Sections that were specifically composed to complete the Mass in the late 1740s include the &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot; part of the Credo.

As usual for its time, the composition is formatted as a Neapolitan mass, consisting of a succession of choral movements with a broad orchestral accompaniment, and sections in which a more limited group of instrumentalists accompanies one or more vocal soloists. Among the more unusual characteristics of the composition is its scale: a total performance time of around two hours, and a scoring consisting of two groups of SATB singers and an orchestra featuring an extended winds section, strings and continuo. Its key, B minor, is rather exceptional for a composition featuring natural trumpets in D, although far more of the work is in this key than B minor.

Even more exceptional, for a Lutheran composer such as Bach, is that the composition is a Missa tota. In Bach&#x27;s day, Masses composed for Lutheran services usually consisted only of a Kyrie and Gloria. Bach had composed five such Kyrie–Gloria Masses before he completed his Mass in B minor: the Kyrie–Gloria Masses, BWV 233–236, in the late 1730s, and the Mass for the Dresden court, which would become Part I of his only Missa tota, in 1733. The Mass was likely never performed in its entirety during Bach&#x27;s lifetime. Its earliest documented complete performance took place in 1859. With many dozens of recordings, it is among Bach&#x27;s most popular vocal works.

In 2015, Bach&#x27;s personal handwritten manuscript of the mass held by the Berlin State Library was included in the UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register, a project to protect and preserve culturally significant documents and manuscripts.

== Background and context ==
On 1 February 1733, Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony, died. Five months of mourning followed, during which all public music-making was suspended. Bach used the opportunity to work on the composition of a Missa, a portion of the liturgy sung in Latin and common to both the Lutheran and Roman Catholic rites. His aim was to dedicate the work to the new sovereign Augustus III, a convert to Catholicism, with the hope of obtaining the title &quot;Electoral Saxon Court Composer&quot;. Upon its completion, Bach visited Augustus III in Dresden and presented him with a copy of the Kyrie–Gloria Mass BWV 232 I (early version), together with a petition to be given a court title, dated July 27, 1733; in the accompanying inscription on the wrapper of the Mass he complains that he had &quot;innocently suffered one injury or another&quot; in Leipzig. The petition did not meet with immediate success, but Bach eventually got his title: he was made court composer to Augustus III in 1736.

In the last years of his life, Bach expanded the Missa into a complete setting of the Latin Ordinary. It is not known what prompted this creative effort. Wolfgang Osthoff and other scholars have suggested that Bach intended the completed Mass in B minor for performance at the dedication of the new Hofkirche in Dresden, a Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Holy Trinity, which was begun in 1738 and was nearing completion by the late 1740s. However, the building was not completed until 1751 and Bach&#x27;s death in July 1750 prevented his Mass from being submitted for use at the dedication. Instead, Johann Adolph Hasse&#x27;s Mass in D minor was performed, a work with many similarities to Bach&#x27;s Mass (the Credo movements in both works feature chant over a walking bass line, for example). In 2013, Michael Maul published research suggesting the possibility that instead, Bach compiled it for performance in Vienna at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral (which was Roman Catholic) on St. Cecilia&#x27;s Day in 1749, as a result of his association with Count Johann Adam von Questenberg. Other explanations are less event-specific, involving Bach&#x27;s interest in &#x27;encyclopedic&#x27; projects (like &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;) that display a wide range of styles, and Bach&#x27;s desire to preserve some of his best vocal music in a format with wider potential future use than the church cantatas they originated in (see &quot;Movements and their sources&quot; below).

== Chronology ==

The chronology of the Mass in B minor has attracted extensive scholarly attention. Recent literature suggests:

* In 1724, Bach composed a Sanctus for six vocal parts for use in the Christmas service. Bach revised it when he reused it in the Mass, changing its initial meter from to , and its vocal scoring from SSSATB to SSAATB.
* As noted above, in 1733 Bach composed the Missa (Kyrie and Gloria) during the five-month period of mourning following the February 1st death of Elector Augustus II and before July 27, when Bach presented the successor, Augustus III of Poland, with the Missa as a set of instrumental and vocal parts. It is possible that the Kyrie was meant as mourning music for Augustus II, and the Gloria as celebratory of the accession of Augustus III.
* In the mid-1740s (c. 1743–46). Bach re-used all three movements from the Gloria in a cantata for Christmas Day (&quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;, BWV 191) with minor changes of notes as well as the texts. Gregory Butler argues that at the same service (which he dates to Christmas 1745, to celebrate the Peace of Dresden), Bach also used the 1724 Sanctus, and that this revisiting of the 1733 Missa suggested further development to the composer.
* In the &quot;last three years or so&quot; of his life, Bach wrote/assembled the Symbolum Nicenum and the remainder of the work; many scholars, including Christoph Wolff, believe he did so in 1748–49. This dating in part reflects the scholarship of Yoshitake Kobayashi, who dates the Symbolum Nicenum section to August–October 1748 based on Bach&#x27;s increasingly stiff and labored handwriting. Wolff among others argues that the &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot; movement was Bach&#x27;s last significant composition. The words had been included in the preceding duet, but then Bach decided to treat them as a separate movement for the choir, giving the words extra weight and improving the symmetry of the Credo. John Butt argues that a definite final date of August 25, 1749, can be given, in that on this date C. P. E. Bach completed a setting of the Magnificat with an &quot;Amen&quot; chorus that &quot;shows distinct similarities&quot; to the &#x27;Gratias&#x27; from the &quot;Missa&quot; and the &#x27;Et expecto&#x27; from the &quot;Symbolum Nicenum&quot;.&quot; C. P. E. Bach later reported that he performed this Magnificat (Wq 215) in 1749 in Leipzig &quot;at a Marian festival ... during the lifetime of his now-deceased father&quot;.

== Title ==
Bach did not give the Mass in B minor a title. Instead, he organized the 1748–49 manuscript into four folders, each with a different title. That containing the Kyrie and Gloria he called &quot;1. Missa&quot;; that containing the Credo he titled &quot;2. Symbolum Nicenum&quot;; the third folder, containing the Sanctus, he called &quot;3. Sanctus&quot;; and the remainder, in a fourth folder he titled &quot;4. Osanna | Benedictus | Agnus Dei et | Dona nobis pacem&quot;. John Butt writes, &quot;The format seems purposely designed so that each of the four sections could be used separately.&quot; On the other hand, the parts in the manuscript are numbered from 1 to 4, and Bach&#x27;s usual closing formula (S.D.G = Soli Deo Gloria) is only found at the end of the &quot;Dona Nobis Pacem&quot;. Further, Butt writes, &quot;What is most remarkable about the overall shape of the Mass in B Minor is that Bach managed to shape a coherent sequence of movements from diverse material.&quot; Butt and George Stauffer detail the ways in which Bach gave overall musical unity to the work.

The first overall title given to the work was in the 1790 estate of the recently deceased C.P.E. Bach, who inherited the score. There, it is called &quot;Die Grosse Catholische Messe&quot; (the &quot;Great Catholic Mass&quot;). It is called that as well in the estate of his last heir in 1805, suggesting to Stauffer that &quot;the epithet reflects an oral tradition within the Bach family&quot;. The first publication of the Kyrie and Gloria, in 1833 by the Swiss collector Hans Georg Nägeli with Simrock, refers to it as &quot;Messe&quot; Finally, Nageli and Simrock produced the first publication in 1845, calling it the &quot;High Mass in B Minor&quot; (&quot;Hohe Messe in h-moll&quot;). The adjective &quot;high&quot;, Butt argues, was &quot;strongly influenced by the monumental impact of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;.&quot; It soon fell from common usage, but the prepositional phrase &quot;in B Minor&quot; survives, even though it is in some ways misleading: only five of the work&#x27;s 27 movements are in B minor, while twelve, including the final ones of each of the four major sections, are in D major (the relative major of B minor). The opening Kyrie, however, is in B minor, with the Christe Eleison in D major, and the second Kyrie in F-sharp minor; as Butt points out, these tonalities outline a B minor chord.

== Orchestration ==

The piece is orchestrated for two flutes, two oboes d&#x27;amore (doubling on oboes), two bassoons, one natural horn (in D), three natural trumpets (in D), timpani, violins I and II, violas and basso continuo (cellos, basses, bassoons, organ and harpsichord). A third oboe is required for the Sanctus.

== Performance history ==

=== In Bach&#x27;s lifetime ===
Bach conducted the Sanctus, in its first version, at the 1724 Christmas service in Leipzig, and re-used it in Christmas services in the mid-1740s. Scholars differ on whether he ever performed the 1733 Missa. Arnold Schering (in 1936) asserted that it was performed in Leipzig on April 26, 1733, when Augustus III of Poland visited the town, but modern scholars reject his argument for several reasons:

# the proposed date fell during an official period of mourning &quot;when concerted music was forbidden in Saxon churches&quot;;
# the extant parts (on which Schering based his hypothesis) are written on a paper found only in documents in Dresden, so were probably copied in Dresden when Bach went there in July; and
# the copyists were not Bach&#x27;s usual ones, but Bach and immediate family members who traveled with him to Dresden: his wife Anna Magdalena, and sons Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel. It also appears that the Bach family employed a copyist in Dresden to assist them.

Scholars differ, however, on whether the Missa was performed in July in Dresden. Christoph Wolff argues that on July 26, 1733, at the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Wilhelm Friedemann Bach had been organist since June, it &quot;was definitely performed ... as evidenced by the extant Dresden performing parts and by the inscription on the title wrapper&quot; given to the king the next day. Hans-Joachim Schulze made this case by pointing to the use of the past tense in the wrapper&#x27;s inscription: &quot;To his royal majesty was shown with the enclosed Missa ... the humble devotion of the author J. S. Bach.&quot; However, Joshua Rifkin rejects the argument, pointing out that the past-tense wording was typical of formal address often not related to performance. Also skeptical is Peter Williams, who notes that &quot;there is no record of performers being assembled for such an event, and in August 1731 Friedemann reported that the Sophienkirche organ was badly out of tune.&quot; However, there is evidence of an organ recital by Bach at the Sophienkirche on 14 September 1731, and Friedemann Bach was only chosen as Organist for the institution on 23 June 1733. He would again perform a 2-hour Organ recital on 1 December 1736 at the Frauenkirche Dresden to inaugurate the new Gottfried Silbermann organ.

Scholars agree that no other public performances took place in Bach&#x27;s lifetime, although Butt raises the possibility that there may have been a private performance or read-through of the Symbolum Nicenum late in Bach&#x27;s life.

=== Later 18th century ===
The first public performance of the Symbolum Nicenum section (under the title &quot;Credo or Nicene Creed&quot;) took place 36 years after Bach&#x27;s death, in Spring of 1786, led by his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach at a benefit concert for the Medical Institute for the Poor in Hamburg. One of Bach’s admirers Joseph Haydn had a copy of the work along with The Well Tempered Clavier.

=== 19th century ===
As recounted by George Stauffer, the next documented performance (not public) in the nineteenth century was when Carl Friedrich Zelter—a key figure in the 19th-century Bach revival—led the Berlin Singakademie in read-throughs of the &quot;Great Mass&quot; in 1811, covering the Kyrie; in 1813 he led read-throughs of the entire work. The first public performance in the century—of just the Credo section—took place in Frankfurt in March, 1828, with over 200 performers and many instrumental additions. In the same year in Berlin, Gaspare Spontini led the Credo section, adding 15 new choral parts and numerous instruments. A number of performances of sections of the Mass took place in the following decades in Europe, but the first attested public performance of the Mass in its entirety took place in 1859 in Leipzig, with Karl Riedel and the Riedel-Verein. The first performance of the Mass in the UK was given by The Bach Choir, newly formed for this purpose by conductor Otto Goldschmidt, in 1876 in St James&#x27;s Hall, London.

=== 20th century ===
The Bach Choir of Bethlehem performed the American premiere of the complete Mass on March 27, 1900, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, though there is evidence that parts of the Mass had been performed in the United States as early as 1870.

From early in the century, authors such as Albert Schweitzer, Arnold Schering, and Frederick Smend called for smaller performance forces, and experiments with (relatively) smaller groups began in the late 1920s.

The first complete recording of the work was made in 1929, with a large choir and the London Symphony Orchestra led by Albert Coates. As of 2022, a database lists over 350 complete recordings with many different types of forces and performance styles. The work has played a central role in the &#x27;historical performance movement&#x27; : Nikolaus Harnoncourt made the first recording with &quot;period instruments&quot; in 1968, his second Bach choral recording. Joshua Rifkin&#x27;s first recording using the one-voice-per-part vocal scoring he proposes was made in 1982, and won a 1983 Gramophone Award.

== Significance ==
The Mass in B minor is widely regarded as one of the supreme achievements of classical music. Alberto Basso summarizes the work as follows: The Mass in B minor is the consecration of a whole life: started in 1733 for &quot;diplomatic&quot; reasons, it was finished in the very last years of Bach&#x27;s life, when he had already gone blind. This monumental work is a synthesis of every stylistic and technical contribution the Cantor of Leipzig made to music. But it is also the most astounding spiritual encounter between the worlds of Catholic glorification and the Lutheran cult of the cross.

Scholars have suggested that the Mass in B minor belongs in the same category as &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, as a summation of Bach&#x27;s deep lifelong involvement with musical tradition—in this case, with choral settings and theology. Bach scholar Christoph Wolff describes the work as representing &quot;a summary of his writing for voice, not only in its variety of styles, compositional devices, and range of sonorities, but also in its high level of technical polish ... Bach&#x27;s mighty setting preserved the musical and artistic creed of its creator for posterity.&quot;

The Mass was described in the 19th century by the editor Hans Georg Nägeli as &quot;The Announcement of the Greatest Musical Work of All Times and All People&quot; (&quot;Ankündigung des größten musikalischen Kunstwerkes aller Zeiten und Völker&quot;). Despite being seldom performed, the Mass was appreciated by some of Bach&#x27;s greatest successors: by the beginning of the 19th century Forkel and Haydn possessed copies.

== Autographs and editions ==
Two autograph sources exist: the parts for the Kyrie and Gloria sections that Bach deposited in Dresden in 1733, and the score of the complete work that Bach compiled in 1748–50, which was inherited by C.P.E. Bach (the autograph has been published in facsimile from the source in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin). However, for his 1786 public performance of the Symbolum Nicenum, C.P.E. Bach, as was typical practice in the era, made additions to the autograph score for performance by adding a 28-bar introduction, replacing the now-obsolete oboe d&#x27;amore with newer instruments (clarinets, oboes, or violins) and making other changes in instrumentation for his own aesthetic reasons. C.P.E. also wrote in his own solutions to reading some passages made nearly illegible by his father&#x27;s late-life handwriting problems.

For this and other reasons, the Mass in B minor poses a considerable challenge to prospective editors, and substantial variations can be noted in different editions, even critical urtext editions. The Bach Gesellschaft edition, edited by Julius Rietz, was published in 1856 based on several sources but without direct access to the autograph. When access was later obtained, the textual problems were so evident that the society published a revised edition the next year. The 1857 edition was the standard for the next century, but was later recognized to be even less accurate than the 1856 version due to inadvertent incorporation of C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s alterations in the autograph. Similarly, the 1954 edition by Friedrich Smend for the Neue Bach-Ausgabe was shown to have significant faults within five years of publication.

Christoph Wolff&#x27;s edition, published by C.F. Peters in 1997, uses two copies of the 1748–50 manuscript made before C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s adulterations to try to reconstruct Bach&#x27;s original readings, and seeks to recover performance details by using all available sources, including cantata movements that Bach reworked in the B minor Mass. Joshua Rifkin&#x27;s edition, published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel in 2006, also seeks to remove the C.P.E. Bach emendations, but differs from Wolff in arguing that the 1748–50 work is, to quote John Butt, &quot;essentially a different entity from the 1733 Missa, and that a combination of the &#x27;best&#x27; readings from both does not really correspond to Bach&#x27;s final (and virtually completed) conception of the work&quot;; Rifkin&#x27;s version seeks to adhere to this final version.

Uwe Wolf&#x27;s edition, published by Bärenreiter in 2010, relies upon x-ray spectrograph technology to differentiate J.S. Bach&#x27;s handwriting from the additions made by C.P.E. Bach and others. Ulrich Leisinger&#x27;s edition, published by Carus in 2014, accepts some of C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s revisions and uses the 1733 Dresden parts as the primary source for the Kyrie and Gloria.

== Movements and their origins ==

The work consists of 27 sections. Tempo and metrical information and parodied cantata sources come from Christoph Wolff&#x27;s 1997 critical urtext edition, and from George Stauffer&#x27;s &quot;Bach: The Mass in B Minor&quot;. except where noted. Regarding sources, Stauffer, summarizing current research as of 1997, states that &quot;Specific models or fragments can be pinpointed for eleven of the work&#x27;s twenty-seven movements&quot; and that &quot;two other movements [the &quot;Domine Deus&quot; and &quot;Et resurrexit&quot;] are most probably derived from specific, now lost sources.&quot; But Stauffer adds &quot;there is undoubtedly much more borrowing than this.&quot; Exceptions are the opening four bars of the first Kyrie, the &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot; and &quot;Confiteor&quot;.

Butt points out that &quot;only with a musical aesthetic later than Bach&#x27;s does the concept of parody (adapting existing vocal music to a new text) appear in an unfavourable light&quot; while it was &quot;almost unavoidable&quot; in Bach&#x27;s day. He further notes that &quot;by abstracting movements from what he evidently considered some of his finest vocal works, originally performed for specific occasions and Sundays within the Church&#x27;s year, he was doubtless attempting to preserve the pieces within the more durable context of the Latin Ordinary.&quot; Details of the parodied movements and their sources are given below.

===I. Kyrie and Gloria (&quot;Missa&quot;)===

# &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (1st)
::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in B minor, marked Adagio (in the four-bar choral introduction) and then Largo in the main section with an autograph time signature of or common time. 
::Joshua Rifkin argues that, except for the opening four bars, the movement is based on a previous version in C minor, since examination of autograph sources reveals &quot;a number of apparent transposition errors&quot;. John Butt concurs: &quot;Certainly, much of the movement—like many others with no known models—seems to have been copied from an earlier version.&quot; Butt raises the possibility that the opening four bars were originally for instruments alone, but Gergely Fazekas details a case, based on manuscript, historical context, and musical structure, that &quot;Bach might have composed the present introduction in a simpler form for the original C minor version&quot; but &quot;might have made the inner texture denser only for the 1733 B minor version.&quot;
#&lt;li value=2&gt; &quot;Christe eleison&quot;

::Duet (Soprano I &amp; II) in D major with obbligato violins, no autograph tempo marking, time signature of .

#&lt;li value=3&gt; &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (2nd)

::Four-part chorus (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in F minor, marked alla breve, and (in the 1748–50 score) &quot;stromenti in unisono&quot;. Autograph time signature is . George Stauffer points out (p. 49) that &quot;the four-part vocal writing ... points to a model conceived outside the context of a five-voice Mass.&quot;

Note the nine (trinitarian, 3 × 3) movements that follow with a largely symmetrical structure, and the &quot;Domine Deus&quot; in the centre.
#&lt;li value=4&gt;&quot;Gloria in excelsis&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in D major, marked Vivace in the 1733 first violin and cello parts, time signature. In the mid-1740s, Bach reused this as the opening chorus of his cantata &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;, BWV 191.

#&lt;li value=5&gt; &quot;Et in terra pax&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in D major, no autograph tempo marking, time signature of ; in the autographs no double bar separates it from the preceding Gloria section. Again, Bach reused the music in the opening chorus of BWV 191.
#&lt;li value=6&gt; &quot;Laudamus te&quot;

::Aria (Soprano II) in A major with violin obbligato, no autograph tempo marking, time signature of . William H. Scheide argues that Bach based this movement on the opening aria of a lost wedding cantata of his (for which we now have only the text) &quot;Sein Segen fliesst daher wie ein Strom&quot;, BWV Anh. I 14
#&lt;li value=7&gt;&quot;Gratias agimus tibi&quot;

::Four-part chorus (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in D major, marked alla breve, time signature of . The music is a reworking of the second movement of Bach&#x27;s 1731 Ratswechsel (Town Council Inauguration) cantata &quot;Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir&quot;, BWV 29, in which the time signature is the number 2 with a slash through it. (Stauffer adds that both may have an earlier common source.)

#&lt;li value=8&gt;&quot;Domine Deus&quot;

::Duet (soprano I, tenor) in G major with flute obbligato and muted strings, no autograph tempo marking, time signature of . The music appears as a duet in BWV 191. 
::In the 1733 parts, Bach indicates a &quot;Lombard rhythm&quot; in the slurred two-note figures in the flute part; he does not indicate it in the final score or in BWV 191. Stauffer points out (p. 246) that this rhythm was popular in Dresden in 1733. It is possible that Bach added in the 1733 parts to appeal to tastes at the Dresden court and that he no longer wanted it used in the 1740s, or that he still preferred it but no longer felt it necessary to notate it.

#&lt;li value=9&gt; &quot;Qui tollis peccata mundi&quot;

::Four-part chorus (Soprano II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in B minor, marked adagio in the two violin 1 parts from 1733 and lente in the cello, continuo, and alto parts from 1733; time signature. No double bar separates it from the preceding movement in the autograph. The chorus is a reworking of the first half of the opening movement of the 1723 cantata &quot;Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei&quot;, BWV 46.
#&lt;li value=10&gt; &quot;Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris&quot;

::Aria (alto) in B minor with oboe d&#x27;amore obbligato, no autograph tempo marking, time signature.
#&lt;li value=11&gt; &quot;Quoniam tu solus sanctus&quot;

::Aria (bass) in D major with obbligato parts for solo corno da caccia (hunting horn or Waldhorn) and two bassoons, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. 
::Stauffer notes that the unusual scoring shows Bach writing specifically for the strengths of the orchestra in Dresden: while Bach wrote no music for two obbligato bassoons in his Leipzig cantatas, such scoring was common for works others composed in Dresden, &quot;which boasted as many as five bassoonists&quot;, and that Dresden was a noted center for horn playing. Peter Damm has argued that Bach designed the horn solo specifically for the Dresden horn soloist Johann Adam Schindler, whom Bach had almost certainly heard in Dresden in 1731. 
::Regarding lost original sources, Stauffer says, &quot;A number of writers have viewed the clean appearance of the &quot;Quoniam&quot; and the finely detailed performance instructions in the autograph score as signs that this movement is also a parody.&quot; Klaus Hafner argues that the bassoon lines were, in the original, written for oboe, and that in this original a trumpet, not the horn, was the solo instrument. John Butt agrees, adding as evidence that Bach originally notated both bassoon parts with the wrong clefs, both indicating a range an octave higher than the final version, and then corrected the error, and adding that &quot;oboe parts would almost certainly have been scored with trumpet rather than horn.&quot; William H. Scheide has argued in detail that it is a parody of the third movement of the lost wedding cantata &quot;Sein Segen fliesst daher wie ein Strom&quot;, BWV Anh. I 14 Stauffer, however, entertains the possibility that it may be new music.

#&lt;li value=12&gt; &quot;Cum Sancto Spiritu&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in D major, marked Vivace, time signature. 
::Bach reused the music in modified form as the closing chorus of BWV 191. As to origins, Donald Francis Tovey argued that it is based on a lost choral movement from which Bach removed the opening instrumental ritornello, saying &quot;I am as sure as I can be of anything&quot;. Hafner agrees, and like Tovey, has offered a reconstruction of the lost ritornello; he also points to notational errors (again involving clefs) suggesting that the lost original was in four parts, and that Bach added the Soprano II line when converting the original into the &quot;Cum Sancto Spiritu&quot; chorus. Rifkin argues from the neat handwriting in the instrumental parts of the final score that the movement is based on a lost original, and he argues from the musical structure, which involves two fugues, that the original was probably a lost cantata from the middle or late 1720s, when Bach was especially interested in such structures. Stauffer is agnostic on the question.

===II. Credo (&quot;Symbolum Nicenum&quot;)===
Note the nine movements with the symmetrical structure and the crucifixion at the centre.

# &quot;Credo in unum Deum&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in A Mixolydian, no autograph tempo marking, . Stauffer identifies an earlier &quot;Credo in unum Deum&quot; chorus in G major, probably from 1748 to 1749.
#&lt;li value=2&gt; &quot;Patrem omnipotentem&quot;
::Four-part chorus (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in D major, no autograph tempo marking, time signature of 2 with a slash through it in the autograph manuscript. The music is a reworking of the opening chorus of &quot;Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm&quot;, BWV 171.
#&lt;li value=3&gt; &quot;Et in unum Dominum&quot;

::Duet (soprano I, alto) in G major, marked Andante, . Stauffer derives it from a &quot;lost duet, considered for &quot;Ich bin deine&quot;, BWV 213/11 (1733). Original version also included &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot;; the two movements were split when Bach put together the complete &quot;Missa&quot; in 1748–49.

#&lt;li value=4&gt; &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in B minor, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. Wolff among others argues that the &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot; movement was Bach&#x27;s last significant composition.

#&lt;li value=5&gt; &quot;Crucifixus&quot;

::Four-part chorus (Soprano II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in E minor, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. The music is a reworking of the first section of the first chorus of the 1714 cantata &quot;Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen&quot;, BWV 12.

#&lt;li value=6&gt; &quot;Et resurrexit&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in D major, no autograph tempo marking, time signature, polonaise rhythms.

#&lt;li value=7&gt; &quot;Et in Spiritum Sanctum&quot;

::Aria (Bass) in A major with oboi d&#x27;amore obbligati, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. William H. Scheide has argued that it is a parody of the sixth movement of the lost wedding cantata &quot;Sein Segen fließt daher wie ein Strom&quot;, BWV Anh. I 14 (=BWV 1144). Stauffer, however, entertains the possibility that it may be new music.

#&lt;li value=8&gt; &quot;Confiteor&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in F minor, no autograph tempo marking (until the transitional music in bar 121, which is marked &quot;adagio&quot;), time signature. 
::John Butt notes that &quot;the only positive evidence of Bach actually composing afresh within the entire score of the mass is in the &#x27;Confiteor&#x27; section&quot;, by which he means, &quot;composing the music directly into the autograph. Even the most unpracticed eye can see the difference between this and surrounding movements&quot;; one part of the final transitional music is &quot;still illegible ... and necessitates the conjectures of a judicious editor.&quot;

#&lt;li value=9&gt; &quot;Et expecto&quot;

::Five-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto, Tenor, Bass) in D major, marked Vivace ed allegro, implicitly in (as it is not set off with a double bar in the autograph from the Confiteor). The music is a reworking of the second movement of Bach&#x27;s 1728 town council inauguration () cantata &quot;Gott, man lobet dich in der Stille&quot;, BWV 120 on the words &quot;Jauchzet, ihr erfreute Stimmen&quot;.

===III. Sanctus===
#&quot;Sanctus&quot;

::Six-part chorus (Soprano I &amp; II, Alto I &amp; II, Tenor, Bass) in D major, no autograph tempo marking, time signature; leading immediately—without double bar in the sources—into the &quot;Pleni sunt coeli&quot;, marked Vivace, time signature. Derived from an earlier three soprano and one alto work written in 1724 and repeated and altered slightly on Easter 1727; in that 1724/1727 &quot;Sanctus&quot; the first section was marked in , perhaps suggesting a tempo faster than what Bach conceived of when he finally re-used it in the Mass.
===IV. Osanna, Benedictus, Agnus Dei and Dona Nobis Pacem===
# &quot;Osanna&quot;

::Double chorus (both four parts) in D major, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. A reworking of the A section of the chorus &quot;Es lebe der König&quot;, BWV Anh. 11/1 (1732) or &quot;Preise dein Glücke&quot;, BWV 215 (1734).
#&lt;li value=2&gt; &quot;Benedictus&quot;

::Aria for tenor with obbligato instrument (Flute or Violin) in B minor, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. 
::Butt writes that Bach &quot;forgot to specify the instrument&quot; for the obbligato; Stauffer adds the possibilities that Bach had not decided which instrument to use or that he was &quot;indifferent&quot; and left the choice open. The Bach-Ausgabe edition assigned it to the violin, and Stauffer suggests this choice may have been influenced by Beethoven&#x27;s use of the violin in the Benedictus of his &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;. Modern editors and performers have preferred the flute; as Butt notes, the part never uses the G-string of the violin, and modern commentators &quot;consider the range and style to be more suitable for the transverse flute.&quot; 
::William H. Scheide has argued that it is a parody of the fourth movement of the lost wedding cantata &quot;Sein Segen fliesst daber wie ein Strom&quot;, BWV Anh. I 14, for which the text begins &quot;Ein Mara weicht von dir&quot; Stauffer, however, entertains the possibility that it may be new music.
#&lt;li value=3&gt; &quot;Osanna (da capo)&quot;

::As above.
#&lt;li value=4&gt; &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;

::Aria for alto in G minor with violin obbligato, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. Parody of an aria, &quot;Entfernet euch, ihr kalten Herzen&quot; (&quot;Withdraw, you cold hearts&quot;), from a lost wedding serenade (1725). Bach also re-used the wedding aria for the alto aria, &quot;Ach, bleibe doch&quot;, of his 1735 Ascension Oratorio &quot;Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen&quot;, BWV 11; Alfred Dürr has demonstrated that Bach adapted both &quot;Ach, bleibe doch&quot; and the Agnus dei directly from the lost serenade&#x27;s aria, rather than from one to the next.
#&lt;li value=5&gt; &quot;&quot;

::Four-part chorus in D major, no autograph tempo marking, time signature. The music is almost identical to &quot;Gratias agimus tibi&quot; from the &quot;Gloria&quot;.

== Recordings ==

As of 2022, 354 recordings are listed on the Bach Cantatas Website, beginning with the first recording by a symphony orchestra and choir to match, conducted by Albert Coates. Beginning in the late 1960s, historically informed performances paved the way for recordings with smaller groups, boys choirs and ensembles playing &quot;period instruments&quot;, and eventually to recordings using the one-voice-on-a-vocal-part scoring first argued for by Joshua Rifkin in 1982.

<text>Robert Bringhurst (born 1946) is a Canadian poet, typographer and author. He has translated substantial works from Haida and Navajo and from classical Greek and Arabic. He wrote &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot;, a reference book of typefaces, glyphs and the visual and geometric arrangement of type. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in June 2013.

He lives on Quadra Island, near Campbell River, British Columbia (approximately 170 km northwest of Vancouver) with his wife, Jan Zwicky, a poet and philosopher.

==Life==
Bringhurst was born on October 16, 1946, in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Alberta, and British Columbia. He studied architecture, linguistics, and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and comparative literature and philosophy at the University of Utah. He holds a BA from Indiana University (1973) and an MFA in creative writing from the University of British Columbia (1975). In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of the Fraser Valley, and in 2016 was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Simon Fraser University.

Bringhurst taught literature, art history and history of typography at several universities and held fellowships from the Canada Council for the Arts, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the American Philosophical Society, and the Guggenheim Foundation.

==Literary career==
His 1992 publication, &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot; was praised as &quot;the finest book ever written about typography&quot; by the type designers Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones. A collection of his poetry, &quot;The Beauty of the Weapons&quot;, was short-listed for a Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1982, and &quot;A Story as Sharp as a Knife&quot;, his work on Haida symbolism, was nominated for a Governor General&#x27;s Award in 2000. Bringhurst won the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Award for Literary Excellence in 2005, an award which recognizes British Columbia writers who have contributed to the development of literary excellence in the province.

===Work in Haida===
Bringhurst has a strong interest in linguistics, translating works from classical Greek, Arabic, Navajo, and, most significantly, Haida. His interest in Haida culture stems from his friendship and close association with the influential Haida artist Bill Reid, with whom he wrote &quot;The Raven Steals the Light&quot; in 1984, among several other significant collaborations. It was this friendship that in 1987 &quot;started Bringhurst on the philanthropic endeavour of recording the Haida canon&quot;. The result of this labour was a trilogy of works collectively titled &quot;Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers&quot;. The essays in its first volume, A Story As Sharp As A Knife, and particularly its nineteenth chapter, &quot;The Prosody of Meaning,&quot; constitute an important contribution to the understanding of the poetics of oral literatures.

His translations from Haida have been viewed as an attempt to preserve the Haida culture, which in 1991 was considered part of a group &quot;likely to be lost unless strong efforts are made very quickly to perpetuate them&quot;. The Haida translation has caused some controversy. Bringhurst was accused of academic exploitation and cultural appropriation. In 2001, the CBC Radio program &quot;Ideas&quot; aired a two part series called &quot;Land to Stand On.&quot; The series&#x27; first episode featured &quot;a string of Haida claiming [...] that Bringhurst&#x27;s work is &#x27;about keeping us in our place,&#x27; written &#x27;without asking us,&#x27;&quot; and &quot;replete with &#x27;serious errors twisting it into the poetry that he wants&#x27;&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; published a report on the Haida reaction to &quot;A Story as Sharp as a Knife&quot; by Adele Weder. Weder&#x27;s piece was later criticized for citing only two Haida sources, claiming they could speak for the entire Haida community, and was described as an &quot;inflammatory article ... not likely to be mistaken for exemplary journalism&quot;. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; published Bringhurst&#x27;s response, which was later called &quot;considerably more measured&quot;.

In 2001, Jeff Leer reviewed &quot;A Story as Sharp as a Knife&quot; saying Bringhurst has neither formal linguistic education nor significant experience with spoken Haida, and doubting Bringhurst&#x27;s ability to translate from Haida. Leer&#x27;s review compared Bringhurst&#x27;s work unfavourably to Enrico&#x27;s &quot;Skidegate Haida Myths and Histories&quot;, and referred to the Weder review as an authoritative source. Leer&#x27;s publisher, the &quot;International Journal of American Linguistics&quot;, retracted the review and apologized to Bringhurst for publishing:

Most academic discussion and recognition of Bringhurst&#x27;s work in Haida has been positive. Linguist Dell Hymes wrote a review of the &quot;Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers&quot; trilogy (of which &quot;A Story as Sharp as a Knife&quot; is part) in &quot;Language in Society&quot;, praising the trilogy. He said it &quot;should become a classic reference point&quot; for Haida scholars in the future. In 2004, Bringhurst won the Edward Sapir Prize for &quot;Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers&quot;. awarded by the Society for Linguistic Anthropology, a professional organization. The committee giving the award was headed by Leanne Hinton, an expert in American Indian languages, and chair of the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley.

Bringhurst has been defended by Margaret Atwood, who says that &quot;territorial squabbling cannot obscure the fact that Bringhurst&#x27;s achievement is gigantic as well as heroic&quot;, and that far from appropriating native voices, &quot;Masterworks of the Classical Haida Mythtellers&quot; &quot;restores to life two exceptional poets we ought to know&quot;. The CBC documentary was attacked in print for relying &quot;entirely on the fallacy, convenient to the producers, that Bringhurst had not consulted with any Haida&quot;. Bringhurst with the help of Bill Reid had spent the better part of the previous decade working with members of the Haida community. People from other indigenous Canadian communities, such as the late Cree elder Wilna Hodgson have also defended Bringhurst. In a letter to the editor of &quot;Books in Canada&quot;, she called &quot;A Story as Sharp as a Knife&quot; &quot;a gift to First Nation people across [Canada]&quot;, and a true &quot;masterpiece in the growing genre of spoken texts&quot;. In her opinion, Bringhurst&#x27;s &quot;efforts are clearly informed with the kind of integrity that all translators might strive to emulate&quot;.

Bringhurst says that &quot;culture is not genetic&quot; and that he pays respect to Native American languages like Haida by allowing works from those languages to be appreciated as art by as wide an audience as possible. He says he always intended his translations to be &quot;[exercises] in literary history, not in the interpretation of present-day Haida culture&quot;.

<text>The Nika riots (), Nika revolt or Nika sedition took place against Byzantine emperor Justinian I in Constantinople over the course of a week in 532 CE. They are often regarded as the most violent riots in the city&#x27;s history, with nearly half of Constantinople being burned or destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed.

==Background==
The Roman Empire had well-developed associations, known as &quot;demes&quot;, which supported the different factions (or teams) to which competitors in certain sporting events belonged, especially in chariot racing. There were initially four major factions in chariot racing, differentiated by the colour of the uniform in which they competed; the colours were also worn by their supporters. These were the Blues (&quot;Veneti&quot;), the Greens (&quot;Prasini&quot;), the Reds (&quot;Russati&quot;), and the Whites (&quot;Albati&quot;), although by the 6th century the only teams with any influence were the Blues and Greens. Emperor Justinian I was a supporter of the Blues, although his support for the faction abated as he entered the early years of his reign, taking a more neutral stance as he looked to limit the power of the factions. It may be no coincidence that when the emperor treated the factions more equally, they became more inclined to unite. What&#x27;s more, Justinian&#x27;s previous ardent support of the Blues made him seem biased and contributed to his waning control of the capital leading up to 532.

The demes had become a focus for various social and political issues for which the general Byzantine population lacked other forms of outlet. They combined aspects of street gangs and taking positions on claimants to the throne. They frequently tried to affect imperial policy by shouting political demands between races. On the other side, the emperor could appeal to the demes and legitimize their political actions in order to gain their support, and it strengthened the bond between the emperor and the people.

In 531 AD some members of the Blues and Greens were arrested by the city prefect Eudaimon for murder in connection with deaths during rioting after a chariot race. Relatively limited riots were not unknown at chariot races, similar to the football hooliganism that occasionally erupts after association football matches in modern times but with devastations such as arson and murder. The murderers were to be executed, and most of them were. However, on January 10, 532, two of them, a Blue and a Green, survived execution, as the scaffold broke. Hearing this, monks from the monastery of St Conon took the two partisans across to the church of St. Laurence, where they were put under surveillance by the prefect&#x27;s troops.

Justinian was nervous: he was in the midst of negotiating with the Persians over peace in the east at the end of the Iberian War, and now he faced a potential crisis in his city. Therefore, he declared that a chariot race would be held on January 13 and commuted the sentences to imprisonment. The Blues and the Greens responded by demanding that the two men be pardoned. When Justinian ignored their pleas, both factions united under the phrase &quot;Nika&quot; or &quot;conquer&quot; and took to rioting (see Riots for more detail).

==Causes==

Justinian, along with his prominent officials John the Cappadocian and Tribonian, faced significant public disapproval due to the implementation of high tax rates, allegations of corruption against the latter two officials, and John&#x27;s reported harsh treatment of debtors. Justinian and John also reduced expenditure on the civil service and took steps to combat corruption within the civil service. John was particularly unfavourable among the senatorial elites, who were hit hard by John&#x27;s new taxation policy which targeted the wealthiest in society, likely leading to senatorial influence within the riots. Justinian also took steps to diminish the influence of both teams. This was perceived by the Greens as an oppressive action akin to the reforms implemented in the civil service, while the Blues felt a sense of betrayal. The Roman legal code was widely perceived as a marker that distinguished the civilised Romans from &quot;barbarians&quot;. (). The law code was also religiously important as the Romans were believed to be &quot;chosen by God&quot;, it being a symbol of justice. As a result, the successful implementation of significant legal reforms by an emperor was viewed as lending legitimacy to their reign, while a lack of progress in this area was interpreted as a sign of divine displeasure. What had taken nine years for the Theodosian code took Justinian just thirteen months.

However, prior to the Nika riots of January 532, the pace of legal reforms had significantly slowed. Concurrently, Justinian was engaged in an unsuccessful war against the Persian Empire. While initial Byzantine victories at Dara in the spring of 530 and Satala in the summer of 530 had temporarily enhanced his legitimacy, the defeat at Callinicum in 531 and the deteriorating strategic situation had a detrimental effect on the emperor&#x27;s reputation. The legal reforms were met with resistance from the aristocracy from their inception, as they eliminated the ability to utilize obscure laws and jurisprudence to evade unfavorable judgments. As a result, Justinian&#x27;s decision to ignore the factions&#x27; pleas to grant amnesty to the two individuals arrested in connection with the riots further exacerbated the anger and resentment towards the emperor, causing the factions to become more violent in their methods, setting fires and indiscriminately attacking imperial guards.
Another cause that might have added to the intensity of the riots was the fact that the power of these factions had gone unchecked for a long time under Justin, with Justinian then strengthening their rivalries by supporting a specific faction. Furthermore, the fact that activity towards the factions had largely been unrestricted for three decades prior during Justin&#x27;s reign, meant the likelihood of them working together in common cause was far greater. Their almost unrestrained force, combined with any resentment they held against the Emperor, is believed to have led to the Nika riots of 532 C.E. Similarly, it was rare for the two factions to begin working together in this manner and for them to militarise, both of which added to the severity of the uprising.

==Riots==
The timeline provided for these riots is not exact, and it is derived from different sources, including one by John Malalas, and one by Procopius.

Initially, the riots were unlikely to have had the end goal of deposing Justinian, with the early days of the riots being a more extreme show of typical factional vandalism and hooliganism that was exacerbated by the emotional response to the escaped Blue and Green criminals, with the aim to have the arrested rioters released. Usually, riots were more &quot;conservative in nature&quot; and were used to keep the emperor accountable and make him aware of the will of the people. However, in the case of the Nika riots, the populace was not mollified by Justinian&#x27;s empty promises of change and were likely fueled by opportunistic senatorial intervention to shift focus to Justinian&#x27;s deposition. These riots shared common characteristics with others during this period. However, it stands out due to the extent of militarisation. Common behaviour prior to this riot included the throwing of stones, which had been banned by Justinian in his anti-rioting decree of 527.

On January 13, 532, an angry crowd arrived at the Hippodrome for the races. The Hippodrome was next to the palace complex, so Justinian could preside over the races from the safety of his box in the palace. From the start, the crowd hurled insults at Justinian. By the end of the day, at race 22, the partisan chants had changed from &quot;Blue&quot; or &quot;Green&quot; to a unified (&quot;Nika&quot;, meaning &quot;Win!&quot;, &quot;Victory!&quot; or &quot;Conquer!&quot;), and the crowds broke out and began to assault the palace. The riot lasted for a week. Fires started during the tumult destroyed much of the city, including the city&#x27;s foremost church, the Hagia Sophia (which Justinian would later rebuild).

It is believed that on January 14, the second day of the riots, Justinian, rather than negotiating political concessions, offered to host more races and games in an attempt to appease the rioters. This did little to halt the violence however, with the crowd ignoring his pleas for a suspension of the hostilities. In the past, emperors had cancelled races on account of them exacerbating tensions and worsening factional violence.

The rioters demanded that Justinian dismiss the prefect John the Cappadocian and the &quot;quaestor&quot; Tribonian. To de-escalate the situation, Justinian apologized and accepted their demands. However, many in the crowd did not accept his apology. They then declared a new emperor, Hypatius, a nephew of former Emperor Anastasius I. Different sources say that Hypatius may have had an arrangement with Justinian to bring the crowd into the hippodrome. But according to some traditions, he was incorrectly told that Justinian had left the palace and enjoyed being proclaimed emperor. Procopius writes that the factions carried Hypatius away from his home and called him emperor against his and his wife&#x27;s wishes.

Justinian considered fleeing, but his wife Theodora is said to have dissuaded him, saying, &quot;Those who have worn the crown should never survive its loss. Never will I see the day when I am not saluted as empress.&quot; She is also credited, by Procopius, with adding, &quot;[W]ho is born into the light of day must sooner or later die; and how could an Emperor ever allow himself to be a fugitive.&quot; Although an escape route across the sea lay open for the emperor, Theodora insisted that she would stay in the city, quoting an ancient saying, &quot;Royalty is a fine burial shroud,&quot; or perhaps, &quot;[the royal colour] Purple makes a fine winding sheet.&quot;. However, Theodora&#x27;s speech as quoted by Procopius can be viewed as representative of the discussions which took place in the palace rather than literal.

Justinian created a plan that involved the eunuch Narses and the generals Belisarius and Mundus. Carrying a bag of gold given to him by Justinian, the slightly built eunuch entered the Hippodrome alone and unarmed. Narses went directly to the Blues&#x27; section, where he approached the important Blues and reminded them that Justinian supported them over the Greens. He distributed the gold and the Blue leaders spoke quietly with each other and then addressed their followers. In the middle of Hypatius&#x27; coronation, the pro-Justinianic Blues separated off, leading the Greens to hurl stones against them. Then, the troops led by Belisarius, Mundus and Constantiolus stormed into the Hippodrome, with Belisarius capturing Hypatius and Pompeius while Mundus killed any remaining people indiscriminately, whether they were Blues or Greens.

== Aftermath ==
According to the account of Procopius, around 30,000 people were killed, although many likely died as result of trampling in the chaos of the riot rather than at the hands of the soldiers. According to Procopius, Hypatius and Pompeius maintained their innocence and argued that their detainment was an injustice. Despite this Justinian had Hypatius and Pompeius executed and exiled the senators who had supported the riot. He also confiscated the properties of senators that stood against him. Although, he later granted titles and land to Hypatius&#x27; and Pompeius&#x27; children, and some of the officials Justinian dismissed in response to the demands of the rioters, like John the Cappadocian were reinstated to their prior positions.

He then rebuilt Constantinople and the Hagia Sophia. However, the crushing of the Nika riots did not end the factions&#x27; violence. Indeed, in 565, in the last year of Justinian&#x27;s reign, fighting became so bad again that the city prefect Julian had to purge the factions to restore peace.

==Interpretations==

The causes and the accounts of the riots are debated. Geoffrey Greatrex offers the most common view that Justinian&#x27;s miscommunication, indecisiveness and inconsistency with the circus factions caused and escalated the riots. But it has been posited that had his predecessors shown the same lack of consistency, they too could have been subjected to a &quot;Nika&quot; riot. It is the view of Mischa Meier that Justinian may have intentionally provoked the riots so that his political rivals within the senate, like Hypatius may reveal themselves to him. However, Rene Pfeilschifter rejects this argument, considering it radical. Clemens Koehn argues that Justinian may have actually left Constantinople for a period of time. The motive for departure, whether it happened or not, is contested; Theophanes believes it was due to panic, whereas Westbrook suggests Justinian hoped to get fresh troops garrisoned in Thrace.

Most scholars believe that the timeline provided is derived from two diverging traditions, including one by John Malalas and one by Procopius. Procopius provides an insider perspective from the palace while Malalas recounts the Nika riots as an outsider of the events in the city. Procopius, as a legal advisor to Belisarius, may have enhanced Belisarius&#x27; role.

Some believe that a number of the senators saw this as an opportunity to overthrow Justinian, as they were opposed to his new taxes and his lack of support for the nobility.

<text>Else Alfelt (16 September 1910 – 9 August 1974) was a Danish artist who specialized in abstract paintings, and a member of the avant-garde COBRA movement - one of its only two female members. Alfelt was involved with the major avant-garde art movements in Denmark from the 1930s through the 1950s, working in an abstract idiom of colorful prismatic compositions. She was married to Carl-Henning Pedersen, another prominent CoBrA member.

==Early life and education==
Alfelt was born in Copenhagen to the parents Carl Valdemar Ahlefeldt (1882–1954) and Edith Alexandra Regine Julie Thomsen (1893–1938). She began to paint in an early age and remained self-taught as an artist. When her parents divorced while Else was very young, she was sent away to an orphanage by her father’s new wife. Alfelt learned to paint around age 12 by trying to capture staff and other children at the orphanage.

At age 15, Alfelt attended the Technical School in Copenhagen for two years. Her training worked to prepare her to apply to the Art Academy in Copenhagen where she was ultimately turned down. According to her museum website, “the rejection was made on the grounds that she already possessed the necessary painting skills.”
In 1933, when Alfelt was 23 years old, she attended the International Folk High School in Elsinore. There, she met her future husband Carl-Henning Pederson. They married very quickly, and their daughter Vibeke Alfelt was born in 1934. From about 1934 to 1937, the couple struggled financially but felt inspired still, so they would paint over used canvases in order to continue their craft. This was how Pederson allegedly began painting, by being given a used canvas from his wife and instructed to make it his own.

==Career==

Ahlefeldt submitted her work to the annual Autumn Salon of Danish artists (Kunstnernes Efterårsudstilling) from 1929, but her work was not accepted until 1936, when she exhibited two naturalistic portraits. Soon after this, Alfelt&#x27;s painting style shifted to a completely abstract idiom of meditative and colorful prismatic compositions.

Alfelt was involved with the major avant-garde art movements in Denmark from the 1930s through the 1950s. She took part in Linien (The Line, 1934-1939), the artists&#x27; collective and art journal that was the first conduit of French Surrealism to Denmark. Under the German occupation of Denmark during World War Two, Alfelt was an integral component of Helhesten (The Hell-Horse, 1941-1944), the artists&#x27; group and art journal, &quot;Helhesten&quot;, co-founded by Asger Jorn as a harbinger of experimental art and implicit cultural-political resistance. She was also an important member of CoBrA (1948-1951) after the war.

Alfelt&#x27;s work explored motifs such as spirals, mountains, and spheres, which she linked to expressions of &quot;inner space&quot;. Alfelt was directly inspired by nature, specifically mountains, which she sought out on her many travels, such as her trip to Lapland 1945 and Japan in 1967. In addition to paintings she also produced several mosaics.

She was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat in 1961.

==Notable artworks==

== Posthumous exhibitions ==
*“Else Alfelt- The Flower of the Universe” – Carl Henning Pederson og Else Alfelts Museum; 2018.

Alfelt was inspired by travels to Japan to incorporate Zen Buddhism into her artistic style, resulting in 100 meditative paintings all named “Flower of the Universe.” These paintings were all made from Since she created them while traveling to Japan, each piece was composed on paper since it was lightweight and easy to transport.

*“Abstract Women- Else Alfelt and Marianne Grønnow” – Carl Henning Pederson og Else Alfelts museum; March 2015-August 2015.
Abstract women documents two Danish abstract female painters who have gone overlooked by history, and overshadowed by their husbands’ works. While the two artists vary greatly in style and technique, the CHPEA museum brings them together for this exhibition to bring attention to the ways their art challenges established societal norms.

==Legacy==
&#x27;Carl Henning Pedersen og Else Alfelts Museum&#x27; outside Herning. Else Alfelts Vej in the Ørestad district of Copenhagen is named after her. In September 2010, the museum displayed a large-scale exhibition called “Else Alfelt – The Aesthetics of Emptiness.” The exhibition was shown for five months to celebrate what would have been Alfelt’s 100th birthday. The museum page description of the event calls her “one of the most significant women artists in Danish modernism.”

<doc id="251786" wikidata="Q5231780" url="?curid=251786" title="David Bromige">
<text>David Mansfield Bromige (October 22, 1933 – June 3, 2009) was a Canadian-American poet who resided in northern California from 1962 onward. Bromige published thirty books, many so different from one another as to appear to be the work of a different author. Associated in his youth with the New American Poetry and especially with Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley, Bromige is sometimes associated with the language poets, but this connection is based more on his close friendships with some of those poets, and their admiration for his work. It is difficult to fit Bromige into a slot. He departs from language poetry in the thematic unity of many of his poems, in the uses to which he puts found materials, with the romantic aspect of his lyricism, and with the sheer variety of his approaches to the poem.

==Early life==
Bromige was born in London, England. At an early age, he showed signs of being tubercular and was sent to an isolation hospital, but after four months, his condition improved, and he was discharged. That hospital was the first of four crucial interludes, which molded his adult life. The second of these interludes came during the London Blitz. A stick of bombs falling in their customary sequence appeared likely to destroy the Bromiges’ house, with them inside. The next interlude involves his schooling and work experience. When the war ended, Bromige won a scholarship to Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hampstead School and a chance to study at a socially superior school. After completing his School Certificate, Bromige accepted an offer to be a dairyman on a farm in southern Sweden. Each of these interludes changed him. The first made him suspicious of his family; the bombing made him vow to be someone else; work and study gave him the worldly experience to be a poet.

==Becoming a poet==
He met other poets at the University of British Columbia such as George Bowering, Fred Wah, Frank Davey, David Dawson, and Jamie Reid, and they encouraged him to write and publish his work. At the 1963 Vancouver Poetry Festival Bromige met Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, Denise Levertov, Allen Ginsberg, and Robert Duncan.

The result of this endeavor led to the publication of many poems. Robert Hass, the chairman of the Western States Book Award Committee, wrote glowingly of his work and chose his 1988 book, &quot;Desire: Selected Poems, 1963-1987&quot; to win the first prize for poetry. He has twice been honored by the Poetry Foundation, once with a $3,000 and again with a $10,000 prize. And he has twice been honored by the National Endowment for the Arts. He won the college prize for the first poem he ever published.

Three years later, Bromige won a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship. The rules stated that he had to do his graduate work at a different university. In 1962, he chose the University of California at Berkeley after graduating from the University of British Columbia. At UC-Berkeley, Bromige studied with Frederick Crews, Stephen Booth, and Thomas Parkinson. Living in the Bay Area also brought him into contact with a younger generation of American poets, including Ron Loewinsohn, Michael Palmer, Ron Silliman, David Melnick, Kathleen Fraser, Kenneth Irby, Rae Armantrout, Bob Perelman, Harvey Bialy, Robert Grenier, Stephen Ratcliffe, Pat Nolan, Alistair Johnson and more.

In 1968, his third book, &quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot;, was published by Black Sparrow Press. It was the beginning of a twenty-three-year partnership that produced eleven of his books. The poems in this book have a ghostly tone. It is as though Cocteau was doing a very detailed description of Bromige&#x27;s life. The change apparent in his fifth book, &quot;Threads&quot;, is startling. It reads as though the ghostly presences from &quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot; had fleshed out and learned to speak a language from the various lives whose talk fills the book.

==Academic career==
Leaving UC-Berkeley A.B.D., (All but dissertation), Bromige took a teaching position in the English Department at Sonoma State University in 1970. Then came seven books in two years. This is Bromige at an early peak. &quot;Ten Years in the Making&quot; began it. This book consisted of some of his early work, going back to 1960, work engagingly open to the merest reader. Then come selections from &quot;The Gathering&quot;, followed by poems from &quot;Threads&quot;. Next came &quot;Birds of the West&quot;, from Victor Coleman of Coachhouse Press in Toronto. This book consists of three sections: a journal of gardening and visitors; a section of more finished poems, filled with a landscape of Western Sonoma County; and a single, long poem written in sparse triplets to reflect a white-tail kite&#x27;s hovering flight.

Soon afterwards, &quot;Tight Corners and What’s Around Them&quot; was issued by Black Sparrow. Bromige has stated it was the most interesting to him of this clutch of books. &quot;I was using a fairly familiar sort of sentence, in prose, with a last line that either boosted sales or fell flat as a flapjack. I didn’t care. Banal or brilliant, it made no difference in the world I was living in. Besides, sometimes the banal turned brilliant as I listened.&quot;

He also did three pint-sized books about this time for the &quot;Sparrow&quot; series. In 1974, he also published a book of occasional poems, &quot;Spells and Blessings&quot;.

Bromige continued to publish prodigiously in magazines and, in 1980, published a book called &quot;My Poetry&quot;.

The 1980s started with a Pushcart Prize for &quot;My Poetry&quot; and ended with the Western States Poetry Award for his selected poems, &quot;Desire&quot;. In between, Bromige devoted himself to his wife and young daughter while carrying a full-time professor&#x27;s responsibilities in the English Department at Sonoma State University. He coordinated poetry conferences at SSU, published a collaboration with Opal Nations, wrote an analysis of Allen Fisher&#x27;s four-day residency at Langton Street in San Francisco, and was himself the subject of an issue of Tom Beckett&#x27;s &quot;The Difficulties&quot;. In 1990, John Martin, who had moved Black Sparrow Press to Santa Rosa, published &quot;Men, Women &amp; Vehicles&quot;, a book of selected prose.

Bromige retired early from Sonoma State University in 1993, and he continued to publish and give readings. &quot;Tiny Courts in a World Without Scales&quot;, Brick Books, is a book of fifty short poems, showing Bromige at his droll and sarcastic best. He had fun with &quot;They Ate&quot;, a cut up from a turn-of-the-century detective novel, before producing &quot;A Cast of Tens&quot; (Avec Press). Each stanza has 10 lines but in each poem is distributed variously. &quot;The Harbormaster of Hong Kong&quot; (Sun and Moon) came next with many kinds of writing in it including a perfect sonnet. Bromige&#x27;s final book from the 90&#x27;s was &quot;Vulnerable Bundles&quot;, a limited edition of thirty, from Potes and Poets Press.

Missing teaching, Bromige returned to it part-time at the University of San Francisco, and he also began writing what would later be &quot;As in T as in Tether&quot;, which was awarded A Best Book of the Year (2003) recognition from Small Press Traffic. Bromige published &quot;Indictable Suborners&quot; and &quot;Behave or Be Bounced&quot; with dPress, Sebastopol, in 2003. For the past few years, Bromige had been collaborating with poet and dPress editor Richard Denner on 100 Cantos. &quot;Spade: Cantos 1-33&quot; was published in 2006.

Bromige lived in Sebastopol, California. He died on June 3, 2009, of complications from diabetes.

<text>The governor of North Dakota is the head of government of the U.S. state of North Dakota. The governor is the head of the executive branch of North Dakota&#x27;s state government and is charged with enforcing state laws.
There have been 32 governors since North Dakota became a state, serving 33 distinct terms, with William Langer having been elected to multiple terms. The current officeholder is Republican Kelly Armstrong.

==Governors==

Dakota Territory was organized on March 2, 1861; on November 2, 1889, it was split into the states of North Dakota and South Dakota.

The Constitution of North Dakota originally provided for the election of a governor and lieutenant governor every two years, which was changed to four years in 1964. A limit of two terms was added in 2023. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected together on a ticket, and should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. The term of office begins on the December 15 following the election.

<doc id="251791" wikidata="Q7283563" url="?curid=251791" title="Rahsaan Patterson">
<text>Rahsaan Patterson (born January 11, 1974) is an American singer and actor, best known for portraying &quot;The Kid&quot; on the 1980s television show &quot;Kids Incorporated.&quot;

==Career==
===1984: &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;===
After appearing in a school talent show in 1984, Patterson auditioned for the television show &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;. He was cast as &quot;The Kid&quot;, and remained on the show for the next few years, appearing alongside such future stars as Fergie, Renee Sands, Martika, Mario Lopez and Shanice.

===Music career===
After &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, Patterson gained experience as a backup vocalist for several artists (including &quot;Kids&quot; co-star Martika). Following his vocal contributions on Colour Club&#x27;s self-titled album, as well as writing for other artists (his credits include Brandy&#x27;s platinum Top 5 smash &quot;Baby&quot;, and Tevin Campbell&#x27;s hit &quot;Back to the World&quot;).

===1997–98: &quot;Rahsaan Patterson&quot;===
Patterson signed with MCA Records in 1995. Collaborating with Keith Crouch and Jamey Jaz, Ira Schickman, among others, released his self-titled debut album on January 28, 1997. The album peaked at No. 48 on Billboard&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart.

There were two singles released, &quot;Stop By&quot; and &quot;Where You Are&quot; peaked at No. 53 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

Receiving positive reviews from critics, the album failed to find a large audience (the single &quot;Where You Are&quot; did receive attention on R&amp;B radio, and it appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 &quot;Bulletproof&quot;). Patterson did, however, develop a loyal following both in the U.S. and abroad.

===1999–2002: &quot;Love in Stereo, SoundTracks&quot;===
Patterson went to work on his followup, &quot;Love in Stereo&quot;, with Jamey Jaz and new collaborators such as Van Hunt. When &quot;Love in Stereo&quot; was released in late 1999 it received better reviews than its predecessor, although the mainstream overlooked it. The album peaked at No. 51 on &quot;Billboard&quot;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart and two singles, &quot;The Moment&quot; and &quot;Treat You Like A Queen&quot; which peaked at no. 61 on &quot;Billboard&quot;s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. Rahsaan toured in support of &quot;Stereo&quot; playing dates throughout the U.S. and Europe.

Although Patterson and MCA parted ways, he remained busy, continuing to perform live, working as a session singer, and contributing to both soundtracks (&quot;Brown Sugar&quot;) and compilation albums (Steve Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Sign of Things to Come&quot;), while working on the next album.

===2004–08 &quot;After Hours, Wines and Spirits&quot;===
Patterson&#x27;s third album, &quot;After Hours&quot; was released internationally in April 2004, garnering positive reviews. With the forming of his own label, &quot;After Hours&quot; was released in the U.S. in late October. The album debuted at No. 65 on Billboard&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The singles, &quot;So Hot&quot;, &quot;April&#x27;s Kiss&quot; and &quot;Forever Yours&quot; were issued but failed to chart on Billboard. Further collaborative efforts followed.

Patterson&#x27;s album, &quot;Wines &amp; Spirits&quot; (again featuring collaborations with Crouch and Jaz) was released September 24, 2007, and debuted at No. 42 on &quot;Billboard&quot;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, his highest charted to date and No. 45 on Independent Albums Chart. The singles released, &quot;Stop Breaking My Heart&quot; and &quot;Feels Good&quot; charted on Billboard&#x27;s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs both at no. 59 and the later no. 76. A close friend, R&amp;B singer Ledisi, in which he&#x27;s also featured on her album &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot;, explains the genius of Patterson as, &quot;Rahsaan&#x27;s greatest artistic strength is his ability to be overly honest in his recordings and in his live performances. If I had to sum him up in one word, I would call him &#x27;uninhibited&#x27;.&quot;

In August 2008, Patterson released a Christmas album, &quot;The Ultimate Gift&quot;, by November Patterson won a BET J award for Underground Artist of the year.

In 2008, Patterson joined with Australian-born producer/multi-instrumentalist/songwriter Jarrad &#x27;Jaz&#x27; Rogers and Copenhagen-based electro-soul singer Ida Corr to form the London-based alternative soul/pop/funk trio SugaRush Beat Company, who released their self-titled album through RCA (UK) in the summer of 2008.

===2009–present: &quot;Bleuphoria, Touring, New Album&quot;===
After the release of &quot;Wines and Spirits&quot;, Rahsaan resumed touring throughout the U.S. and overseas, and working with several recording artists. On December 14, 2010, a new song was available on iTunes, &quot;Easier Said Than Done&quot;, a slow funk groove aimed as the lead single from his new album. On February 12, 2011, he performed at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club to a sold out crowd, the show received rave reviews. In March 2011, after a concert in Ram&#x27;s Head Tavern in Annapolis, MD, Patterson spoke about his album, &quot;Bleuphoria&quot; during a brief interview for thesoulcialista.

In 2019, Rahsaan released the new single &quot;Sent from Heaven&quot; and announced his new album &quot;Heroes &amp; Gods&quot; will release on May 17 that year.

==Personal life==
Patterson is openly gay. In a 2008 discussion about being a gay artist with LGBT-centric network Logo, for example, he said &quot;For me, it&#x27;s not about being &#x27;the gay artist&#x27;; I&#x27;m an &quot;artist&quot;.&quot; In an interview with BET&#x27;s Daily Voice, Patterson further clarified that &quot;I&#x27;ve never been in the closet or hiding anything.&quot;

<text>The evil eye is a supernatural belief in a curse brought about by a malevolent glare, usually inspired by envy. Amulets to protect against it have been found dating to around 5,000 years ago.


It is found in many cultures in the Mediterranean region, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America, with such cultures often believing that receiving the evil eye will cause misfortune or injury, while others believe it to be a kind of supernatural force that casts or reflects a malevolent gaze back upon those who wish harm upon others (especially innocents). The idea also appears multiple times in Jewish rabbinic literature.

Different cultures have pursued measures to protect against the evil eye. Some of the most famous talismans against the evil eye include the nazar amulet, itself a representation of an eye, and the hamsa, a hand-shaped amulet. Older iterations of the symbol were often made of ceramic or clay; however, following the production of glass beads in the Mediterranean region in approximately 1500 BC, evil eye beads were popularised with the Indians, Phoenicians, Persians, Arabs, Greeks, Romans and Ottomans. Illyrians used objects with the shape of phallus, hand, leg, and animal teeth against the evil eye. Ancient Romans used representations of phallus, such as the fascinus, to protect against the evil eye, while in modern-day Southern Italy a variety of amulets and gestures are used for protection, including the cornicello, the cimaruta, and the sign of the horns.

In different cultures, the evil eye can be fought against with yet other methods – in Arab culture, saying the phrase &quot;Masha&#x27;Allah&quot; () (&quot;God has willed it&quot;) alongside a compliment prevents the compliment from attracting the evil eye, whereas in some countries, such as Iran, certain specific plants – such as rue – are considered prone to protecting against the evil eye.

==History==

The evil eye originated in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). The earliest evidence excavated from various ancient cities include:

Written documents: A Sumerian cuneiform mentions an &quot;eye ad-gir&quot; that afflicts people with evil

Archaeological data: Alabaster idols with incised eyes were found in Tell Brak, one of Mesopotamia&#x27;s oldest cities

Amulets: Eye-shaped amulets were found in Mesopotamia

Most experts believe that the concept of the evil eye belief emerged from ancient Mesopotamia and spread to surrounding areas. Written documents and archaeological data reveal that the people of Sumer, who are believed to be the first inhabitants of the region, initiated, continued, and extended this belief.

Texts from ancient Ugarit, a port city in what is now Syria, attests to the concept of &#x27;evil eye&#x27; – the city existed until about 1180 BC, during the late Bronze Age collapse. In Greek Classical antiquity, the &#x27;evil eye&#x27; (&quot;mati&quot;) is referenced by Hesiod, Callimachus, Plato, Diodorus Siculus, Theocritus, Plutarch, Heliodorus, Pliny the Elder, and Aulus Gellius. Peter Walcot&#x27;s &quot;Envy and the Greeks&quot; (1978) listed more than one hundred works by these and other authors mentioning the evil eye. Ancient Greek authors frequently mentioned the (; evil eye).

As widely documented in archaeologic findings and in ancient literature, the Illyrians believed in the force of spells and the evil eye, in the magic power of protective and beneficial amulets which could avert the evil eye or the bad intentions of enemies. Such amulets included objects with the shape of phallus, hand, leg, and animal teeth.

Classical authors attempted both to describe and to explain the function of the evil eye. Plutarch in his work entitled &quot;Symposium&quot; has a separate chapter describing such beliefs. In his scientific explanation, he stated that the eyes were the chief, if not sole, source of the deadly rays that were supposed to spring up like poisoned darts from the inner recesses of a person possessing the evil eye. Plutarch treated the phenomenon of the evil eye as something seemingly inexplicable that is a source of wonder and cause of incredulity. Pliny the Elder described the ability of certain African enchanters to have the &quot;power of fascination with the eyes and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze&quot;.

The idea of the evil eye appears in the poetry of Virgil in a conversation between the shepherds Menalcas and Damoetas. In the passage, Menalcas is lamenting the poor health of his stock: &quot;What eye is it that has fascinated my tender lambs?&quot;. The Christian Gospels record the fact that Jesus warned against the evil eye in a list of evils (Mark 7:22).

Ancient Greeks and Romans believed that the evil eye could affect both humans and animals, for example cattle.

===Protection from the eye===
Belief in the evil eye during antiquity varied across different regions and periods. The evil eye was not feared with equal intensity in every corner of the Roman Empire. There were places in which people felt more conscious of the danger of the evil eye. In Roman times, not only were individuals considered to possess the power of the evil eye but whole tribes, especially those of Pontus and Scythia, were believed to be transmitters of the evil eye.

Many different objects and charms were used for protection from fascination. The protective items referred to by the Greeks with a variety of names such as apotropaia, probaskania, periammata, periapta and profylaktika. Greeks placed talismans in their houses and wore amulets to protect them from the evil eye. Peisistratus hung the figure of a kind of grasshopper before the Acropolis of Athens for protection.
The &quot;fascinus&quot; or &quot;fascinum&quot;, from the Latin verb &quot;fascinare&quot; &quot;to cast a spell&quot; (the origin of the English word &quot;&quot;), is one example of an apotropaic object used against the evil eye. They have been found throughout Europe and into the Middle East from contexts dating from the first century BC to the fourth century AD. The phallic charms were often objects of personal adornment (such as pendants and finger rings), but also appeared as stone carvings on buildings, mosaics, and wind-chimes (&quot;tintinnabula&quot;). Examples of stone phallic carvings, such as from Leptis Magna, depict a disembodied phallus attacking an evil eye by ejaculating towards it.
In describing their ability to deflect the evil eye, Ralph Merrifield described the Roman phallic charm as a &quot;kind of lightning conductor for good luck&quot;.

Another way for protection from fascination used by the ancient Greeks and Romans was by spitting into the folds of the clothes.

Ancient Greeks also had an old custom of dressing boys as girls in order to avert the evil eye.

==Around the world==

Belief in the evil eye is strongest in West Asia, Latin America, East and West Africa, Central America, South Asia, Central Asia, the Caribbean, and Europe, especially the Mediterranean region; it has also spread to areas, including northern Europe, particularly in the Celtic regions, and the Americas, where it was brought by European colonists and West Asian immigrants.

Belief in the evil eye is found in the Islamic doctrine, based upon the statement of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, &quot;The influence of an evil eye is a fact...&quot; [Sahih Muslim, Book 26, Number 5427]. Authentic practices of warding off the evil eye are also commonly practiced by Muslims: rather than directly expressing appreciation of, for example, a child&#x27;s beauty, it is customary to say &quot;Masha&#x27;Allah&quot;, that is, &quot;God has willed it&quot;, or invoking God&#x27;s blessings upon the object or person that is being admired.

A number of beliefs about the evil eye are also found in folk religion, typically revolving around the use of amulets or talismans as a means of protection.

In the Aegean Region and other areas where light-colored eyes are relatively rare, people with green eyes, and especially blue eyes, are thought to bestow the curse, intentionally or unintentionally. Thus, in Greece and Turkey amulets against the evil eye take the form of eyes looking back at someone. These amulets are known as Greek eyes or Turkish eyes, depending on the region.

In the painting by John Phillip, we witness the culture-clash experienced by a woman who suspects that the artist&#x27;s gaze implies that he is looking at her with the evil eye.

Among those who do not take the evil eye literally, either by reason of the culture in which they were raised or because they simply do not believe it, the phrase, &quot;to give someone the evil eye&quot; usually means simply to glare at the person in anger or disgust. The term has entered into common usage within the English language. Within the broadcasting industry, it refers to when a presenter signals to the interviewee or co-presenter to stop talking due to a shortage of time.

==Protective talismans and cures==
Attempts to ward off the curse of the evil eye have resulted in a number of talismans in many cultures. As a class, they are called &quot;apotropaic&quot; (Greek for &quot;prophylactic&quot;, &quot;apotraiptic&quot; / προφυλακτικός, αποτρεπτικός or &quot;protective&quot; or &quot;determent&quot;, literally: &quot;turns away&quot;) talismans, meaning that they turn away or turn back harm.

Disks or balls, consisting of concentric blue and white circles (usually, from inside to outside, dark blue, light blue, white, and dark blue) representing an evil eye are common apotropaic talismans in West Asia and the Balkans, found on the prows of boats and elsewhere; in some forms of the folklore, the staring eyes are supposed to bend the malicious gaze back to the sorcerer.

Known as &quot;nazar&quot; ( or ), this talisman is most frequently seen in Turkey, found in or on houses and vehicles or worn as beads.

The word hamsa, also spelled khamsa, means &quot;five&quot; referring to the fingers of the hand. In the Levantine Christian culture is called the Hand of Mary, in some Muslim and Balkan cultures, the Hand of Fatima. It is condemned as superstition by doctrinaire Muslims. To many individuals, though, the hamsa or nazar are simply used as decoration.

A variety of motifs to ward off the evil eye are commonly woven into tribal kilim rugs. Such motifs include a cross (Turkish: Haç) to divide the evil eye into four, a hook (Turkish: Çengel) to destroy the evil eye, or a human eye (Turkish: Göz) to avert the evil gaze. The shape of a lucky amulet (Turkish: Muska; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse) is often woven into kilims for the same reason.

While the Egyptian Eye of Horus is a similar symbol of protection and good health and luck, the Greek evil eye talisman specifically protects against malevolent gazes. Similarly, the Eye-Idols () excavated at the Tell Brak Eye Temple are believed to have been figurines offered to the gods, and according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, are unrelated to a belief in the evil eye.

===By religion===

====In Judaism====

The evil eye is mentioned several times in the classic &quot;Pirkei Avot (Ethics of Our Fathers)&quot;. In Chapter II, five disciples of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai give advice on how to follow the good path in life and avoid the bad. Rabbi Eliezer says an evil eye is worse than a bad friend, a bad neighbor, or an evil heart.

Talmudic exegete, Rashi, says in the wake of the words of Israel&#x27;s Sages that when the ten sons of Jacob went down into Egypt to buy provisions, they made themselves inconspicuous by each entering into a separate gate, so that they would not be gazed upon by the local Egyptians and, thereby, trigger a malevolent response (the Evil eye) by their onlookers, seeing that they were all handsome and of brave and manly dispositions.

Some Jews believe that a &quot;good eye&quot; designates an attitude of goodwill and kindness towards others. Someone who has this attitude in life will rejoice when his fellow man prospers; he will wish everyone well. An &quot;evil eye&quot; denotes the opposite attitude. A man with &quot;an evil eye&quot; will not only feel no joy but experience actual distress when others prosper and will rejoice when others suffer. A person of this character represents a great danger to moral purity, according to some Jews.

Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook explained that the evil eye is &quot;an example of how one soul may affect another through unseen connections between them. We are all influenced by our environment [...] The evil eye is the venomous impact from malignant feelings of jealousy and envy of those around us.&quot;

In Jewish religious law, it is forbidden for a person to stand and gaze at another&#x27;s field of ripening grain, for fear that his stares will do harm to that field and its produce. Likewise, the rabbis caution a person not to buy a field that borders a city, unless he were to first build a fence around the field, in order to prevent the bad affects of the evil eye of passers-by.

Many observant Jews avoid talking about valuable items they own, good luck that has come to them and, in particular, their children. If any of these are mentioned, the speaker and/or listener will say (), meaning &quot;without an evil eye&quot;, or (; often shortened to , ), &quot;no evil eye&quot;. Another way to ward off the evil eye is to spit three times (or pretend to). Romans call this custom &quot;despuere malum,&quot; to spit at evil.

Rituals surrounding birth and young children are often centred around protection from the evil eye. An example of this is the textile neckbands worn by boys for their brit milah, especially in the regions of Alsace, Southern Germany and Switzerland. The neckbands often had a central coin or colourful coral, designed to draw the evil eye away from the boy and thus protect him during circumcision.

====In Islam====
In Islam, the evil eye, or &quot;&quot; (, also ), is a common belief that individuals have the power to cause harm to people, animals or objects, by looking at them in a way that indicates jealousy. Although envy activates the evil eye, this happens (or usually happens) unconsciously, and the person who casts it is not responsible (or usually not responsible) for it. In addition to being looked at, astrology may play a part. Someone may become a victim of the evil eye by virtue of an &quot;unfavorable celestial configuration&quot; at the time of victim&#x27;s birth, &quot;according to some scholars&quot;.

The evil eye causes its victim to become unwell the next day, unless a protective phrase such as &quot;with the will of God&quot; (&quot;mashallah&quot; in Arabic) or “May Allah Bless You” (Alhumma Barik) is recited.

Among the rituals to ward off the evil eye are to say &quot;TabarakAllah&quot; () (&quot;Blessings of God&quot;) or &quot;Masha&#x27;Allah&quot; () (&quot;God has willed it&quot;) if a compliment is to be made.

====In Hinduism====

Although Śrauta traditions do not have a concept of evil, it has been incorporated as a mainstream practice within modern Hinduism. For example, when a mother observes that her child is being excessively complimented, it is common for the mother to attempt to neutralize the effects of the evil eye (&quot;nazar utarna&quot;, &quot;drshti teeta&quot; or &quot;drushti tegeyodu&quot;). A common example of a neutralizing ritual involves holding red chilies in one hand and circling the child&#x27;s head a few times, then burning the chilies.

===By geographic region===
====Albania====
The evil eye () is a folk belief widespread among all Albanians. Objects that are traditionally used by Albanians for prevention, protection, and healing from the evil eye are: fire (zjarri), smoke, ashes and embers, and fire related metallic objects; serpent/snake (symbolism, as well as amulets with snakeskin and snake head); garlic; house carvings and house dolls (&quot;dordolec&quot; in human shape or &quot;kukull&quot; in animal shape); amulets or pendants made with thunderstones (&quot;kokrra e rrufesë&quot; or &quot;guri i rejës&quot;), wolf teeth, seashells; etc.

In order to contrast or avert the evil eye, several rituals with fire, smoke, ashes and embers are practiced. A typical ritual performed by the oldest woman of the family consists in taking a bunch of dry grass and burning it somewhere near the cloth that is being woven, so that the smoke goes towards it. If the grass crackled during the burning, even the evil eye would explode and not be able to do any harm, granting the good luck of the cloth. Ashes and embers are believed to have protective and healing properties, especially for children. In order to get protection against the evil eye, the face of a child is covered with ashes. When children have been taken by the evil eye, they are washed on the ashes. Other Albanian rituals to avert evil, illness and harm in general are performed with fire (zjarri), seeking assistance from its supernatural power.

Albanians traditionally believed in the supreme powers of thunder-stones, which were believed to be formed during lightning strikes and to be fallen from the sky (qielli). Thunder-stones were preserved in family life as important cult objects. It was believed that bringing them inside the house could bring good fortune, prosperity and progress in people, in livestock and in agriculture, or that rifle bullets would not hit the owners of the thunder-stones. A common practice was to hung a thunder-stone pendant on the body of the cattle or on the pregnant woman for good luck and to contrast the evil eye.

====Caribbean/West Indies====
In Trinidad and Tobago, the evil eye is called &quot;bad eye&quot;, &quot;maljo&quot; (from French Creole , literally meaning &#x27;bad eye&#x27;) and &quot;najar&quot; by the Indo-Trinidadians. The term is used in the infinitive (to maljo) and as a noun (to have/get maljo) referring to persons who have been afflicted. Maljo may be passed on inadvertently, but is believed to be more severe when coming from an envious person or one with bad intentions. It is thought to happen more readily when a person is stared at–especially while eating food. A person who has been taken by the ‘bad eye’ may experience unexplained illness or misfortune. In traditional rural legends, &quot;[t]he general belief is that doctors cannot cure maljo—only people who know prayers can &#x27;cut&#x27; the maljo and thus cure the victim&quot;.

There are several secular approaches to combatting maljo, but more extreme cases are usually referred to as spiritual rituals, with a particularly strong influence from the Hindu religion.

In non-religious respects, there is a strong cultural association between the evil eye and the color blue. It is believed to ward off maljo when worn as clothing or accessories, so much so that some striking shades are referred to as &quot;maljo blue&quot;. Blue ornaments may be used to protect a household, and blue bottles from Milk of Magnesia have been hung on trees or placed in the yard surrounding a property.

Blue soap and Albion Blue (an indigo dye referred to Trinbagonians simply as &quot;blue&quot;) are traditionally used for domestic washing, but are also considered to prevent maljo if used in bath water or to anoint the soles of the feet.

Jumbie beads are the poisonous seeds of the Rosary Pea tree which are used to make jewelry that also wards off maljo and evil spirits.

One superstition is that a pinch can reverse maljo following interpersonal interactions, especially if one is stared at or given a compliment. Some also believe that rubbing one&#x27;s own saliva in their hair will counteract maljo in general, but particularly from envy of the hair texture and length. A bath in the sea is also thought to relieve an afflicted person.

Maljo believers are particularly concerned with safeguarding babies and children, who are considered to be most vulnerable to its effects. It may be ‘caused by someone born with a &quot;blight&quot; in the eye when such a person looks admiringly at a child. It can also occur with a pat on the head, or with just a glance. Whether it is intended or not, compliments (...) can cause maljo. It can be caused by a stranger, a member of the child&#x27;s immediate family, or by another relative.’ It may even be passed on by a parent who is obsessed with their own child. A baby with maljo ‘refuses to eat or drink, cries continually, and &quot;pines away.&quot;. It may have an &quot;attack of fever&quot;.’

Bracelets made of jet beads are traditionally given to newborns to wear as a preventative measure, while elders also recommend securing a bag of blue dye to the baby&#x27;s clothes. This is because a newborn is viewed as most vulnerable.

Following Hindu influence, a tikka of a black dot (made from kajar) is placed on a baby&#x27;s forehead and black eyeliner is applied and is thought to distract the attention of the evil eye and protect the child as such.

The most common najar remedy comes in the form of a Hindu ritual called a jharay. It may be practiced at home (usually by parents or elders) or by a Pandit or spiritual practitioner. There are many variations to the ritual, and non-Hindu persons readily participate if they are considered to have been affected by najar.

The main implement in a jharay is either a peacock feather or a cocoyea broom- a traditional broom made using the midrib of the coconut palm leaf. Some also report a knife or machete being used. In some instances, the cocoyea broom is measured against a particular part of the body at the beginning of the ceremony, and it is believed to be confirmation of najar if the recorded length has changed by the end of the session. The officiant will say a prayer while using the tool of choice to brush the person from head to toe. The prayer is conventionally said in Sanskrit, but may also be said in Hindustani or English.

A jharay may focus on a specific point of affliction or pain (head, hair, back, feet and so on).

It is not unusual for a jharay ceremony to be carried out on children and babies. People believe that najar can cause death. Two types were reported: the &quot;dragging&quot; kind, where the baby gets smaller and smaller and goes through all of the symptoms mentioned above, before withering and dying; the &quot;twenty-four hour&quot; maljo, said to kill in just twenty-four hours if effective help is not obtained.’

Another Hindu ritual called the &quot;oucchay&quot; is also employed to heal najar, though this might also be incorrectly interchangeably called a jharay. Ingredients such as onion skin, salt, cobweb, hot pepper or mustard seeds, piece of a cocoyea broom, a lock of the victim&#x27;s hair (in the case of children, it is a lock of the mother&#x27;s hair) are wrapped in a tissue or newspaper. The officiant will circle the wrapped objects around the victim&#x27;s body before burning them all. It is believed that if the items create a large, crackling flame and a foul stench, it is an indication that the victim had a severe case of najar. At the end of the ritual, the victim may be asked to walk away without looking back while the objects burn.

In the Afro-Caribbean Spiritual Baptist and Orisha-Shango traditions, a special piece of jewelry called a &#x27;guard&#x27; will be blessed by an elder, who invokes its protection on the wearer. It may be a waist bead, anklet, bracelet, or necklace. For babies, a large safety pin might be used as a guard.

====Greece====
In modern Greece, the evil eye is known as () or simply as (), &quot;eye&quot;.
It is cast away through the process of (), whereby the healer silently recites a secret prayer passed over from an older relative of the opposite sex, usually a grandparent. Such prayers are revealed only under specific circumstances, as according to their customs those who reveal them indiscriminately lose their ability to cast off the evil eye. There are several regional versions of the prayer in question, a common one being: &quot;Holy Virgin, Our Lady, if [insert name of the victim] is suffering of the evil eye, release him/her of it.&quot; Evil repeated three times. According to custom, if one is indeed afflicted with the evil eye, both victim and healer then start yawning profusely. The healer then performs the sign of the cross three times, and emits spitting-like sounds in the air three times.

Another &quot;test&quot; used to check if the evil eye was cast is that of the oil: under normal conditions, olive oil floats in water, as it is less dense than water. The test of the oil is performed by placing one drop of olive oil in a glass of water, typically holy water. If the drop floats, the test concludes there is no evil eye involved. If the drop sinks, then it is asserted that the evil eye is cast indeed. Another form of the test is to place two drops of olive oil into a glass of water. If the drops remain separated, the test concludes there is no evil eye, but if they merge, there is. There is also a third form where in a plate full of water the &quot;healer&quot; places three or nine drops of oil. If the oil drops become larger and eventually dissolve in the water there is an evil eye. If the drops remain separated from water in a form of a small circle there is not. The first drops are the most important and the number of drops that dissolve in water indicates the strength of the evil eye. Note that a secret chant is spoken when these tests are conducted. The words of the chant are closed practiced and can only be passed from man to woman, or woman to man.

There is another form of the &quot;test&quot; where the healer prepares a few cloves by piercing each one with a pin. Then she lights a candle and grabs a pinned clove with a pair of scissors. She then uses it to do the sign of the cross over the afflicted whilst the afflicted is asked to think of a person who may have given him the evil eye. Then the healer holds the clove over the flame. If the clove burns silently, there is no evil eye present; however, if the clove explodes or burns noisily, that means the person in the thoughts of the afflicted is the one who has cast the evil eye. As the clove explodes, the evil eye is released from the afflicted. Cloves that burn with some noise are considered to be &quot;words&quot; () someone foul-mouthing you that you ought to be wary of. The burned cloves are extinguished into a glass of water and are later buried in the garden along with the pins as they are considered to be contaminated. Greek people will also ward off the evil eye by saying &quot;I spit so that I won&#x27;t give you the evil eye&quot; (). Contrary to popular belief, the evil eye is not necessarily given by someone wishing you ill, but it stems from admiration - if one considers admiration to be a compelled emotion of astonishment at a rival&#x27;s success over one&#x27;s evil plan. Since it is technically possible to give yourself the evil eye, it is advised to be humble.

The Greek Fathers accepted the traditional belief in the evil eye, but attributed it to the Devil and envy. In Greek theology, the evil eye or &quot;vaskania&quot; () is considered harmful for the one whose envy inflicts it on others as well as for the sufferer. The Greek Church has an ancient prayer against vaskania from the &quot;Megan Hieron Synekdemon&quot; () book of prayers.

====Assyrians====
The belief of the evil eye is strong in Assyrians. A blue/turquoise bead with two, seven or nine small holes resembling eyes around a necklace is often worn and is said to be protection from the evil eye. Some may also spit three times without saliva. It is said that people with green or blue eyes are more prone to the evil eye effect.

====Turkey====

A typical nazar is made of handmade glass featuring concentric circles or teardrop shapes in dark blue, white, light blue, and black, occasionally with a yellow/gold edge. Each color of the nazar has a specific meaning, symbolizing various aspects of protection and luck.

Cultures that have nazars or some variation include Turkey, Romania, Albania, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Armenia, Iran, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Türkmenistan, Iraq and Azerbaijan, where the nazar is often hung in homes, offices, cars, children&#x27;s clothing, or incorporated in jewellery and ornaments.

They are a popular choice of souvenir with tourists.

====Ethiopia====
Belief in the evil eye, also known as &quot;buda&quot; or &quot;bouda&quot;, is widespread in Ethiopia. Buda is generally believed to be a power held and wielded by those in a different social group, for example among the metalworkers. Some Ethiopian Christians carry an amulet or talisman, known as a &quot;kitab&quot;, or will invoke God&#x27;s name, to ward off the ill effects of buda. A debtera, who is either an unordained priest or educated layperson, will create these protective amulets or talismans.

==== Senegal ====
The equivalent of the evil eye in Wolof would be the &quot;thiat&quot;. It is believed that beautiful objects may break if enviously stared at by others. To repel the effect of the evil eye, Senegalese people may wear cowrie shell bracelets. The sea shells are said to absorb the negative energy of the thiat, and gradually darken until the bracelet breaks. It is also common for superstitious people to wear &quot;gris-gris&quot; made by a marabouts to avoid misfortune.

==== Indian subcontinent ====

===== India =====
In the northern states of India, such as the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, the evil eye is called &quot;nazar&quot; (meaning gaze or vision) or more commonly &quot;Buri Nazar&quot;. A charm bracelet, tattoo or other object (Nazar battu), or a slogan (Chashme Baddoor (slogan)), may be used to ward off the evil eye. Some truck owners write the slogan to ward off the evil eye: &quot;buri nazar wale tera muh kala&quot; (&quot;O evil-eyed one, may your face turn black&quot;).

In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, people call it as &quot;disti&quot; or &quot;drusti&quot;, while people of Tamil Nadu call it &quot;drishti&quot; or &quot;kannu&quot; (formally &quot;kan&quot;, meaning &quot;the eye&quot;). The people of Kerala also call it &quot;drishti&quot; or &quot;kannu&quot;, the latter of which is Malayalam for &quot;eye&quot;. The people of Karnataka call it &quot;drushti&quot;, similar to other southern Indian languages. To remove &quot;drishti&quot;, people follow several methods based on their culture/area. Items often used are either rock salt, red chilies, white pumpkins, oiled cloth, or lemons coated with kumkuma. People remove &quot;drishti&quot; by rotating any one of these items around the affected person. The person who removes it will then burn the item, or discard it in a place where others are not likely to stamp on these items. People hang pictures of fierce and scary ogres called drishti bommai in their homes or vehicles, to ward off the evil eye.

In India, babies and newborn infants will usually have their eye adorned with kajal, or eyeliner. This would be black, as it is believed in India that black wards off the evil eye or any evil auras. The umbilical cord of babies is often preserved and cast into a metal pendant, and tied to a black string — babies can wear this as a chain, bracelet or belt—the belief, once more, is that this protects the infant from &quot;drishti&quot;. This is a practice that has been followed right from historical times. People usually remove &quot;drishti&quot; on full-moon or new-moon days, since these days are considered to be auspicious in India.

Indians often leave small patches of rock salt outside their homes, and hang arrangements of green chilies, neem leaves, and lemons on their stoop. The belief is that this will ward away the evil eye cast on families by detractors.

=====Pakistan=====

In Pakistan, the evil eye is called &quot;Nazar&quot; (). People usually may resort to reading the last three chapters of the Quran, namely Sura Ikhlas, Sura Al-Falaq and Sura Al-Nas. The phrase &quot;masha&#x27;Allah&quot; (, meaning &quot;God has willed it&quot;) is commonly said to ward off the evil eye. Understanding of the evil eye varies by the level of education. Some perceive the use of black color to be useful in protecting from the evil eye. Others use ta&#x27;awiz to ward off the evil eye. Truck owners and other public transport vehicles may commonly be seen using a small black cloth on the bumpers to prevent the evil eye.

====Italy====
The (&quot;little horn&quot;), also called the (&quot;little horn&quot;, plural ), is a long, gently twisted horn-shaped amulet. Cornicelli are usually carved out of red coral or made from gold or silver. The type of horn they are intended to copy is not a curled-over sheep horn or goat horn but rather like the twisted horn of an African eland or a chili pepper. A tooth or tuft of fur of the Italian wolf was worn as a talisman against the evil eye.

One idea that the ribald suggestions made by sexual symbols distract the witch from the mental effort needed to successfully bestow the curse. Another is that since the effect of the eye was to dry up liquids, the drying of the phallus (resulting in male impotence) would be averted by seeking refuge in the moist female genitals. Among the ancient Romans and their cultural descendants in the Mediterranean nations, those who were not fortified with phallic charms had to make use of sexual gestures to avoid the eye. Such gestures include scratching one&#x27;s testicles (for men), as well as the gesture and the fig sign; a fist with the thumb pressed between the index and middle fingers, representing the phallus within the vagina. In addition to the phallic talismans, statues of hands in these gestures, or covered with magical symbols, were carried by the Romans as talismans.

The wielder of the evil eye, called the , is described as having a striking facial appearance, high arching brows with a stark stare that leaps from his eyes. He often has a reputation for clandestine involvement with dark powers and is the object of gossip about dealings in magic and other forbidden practices. Successful men having tremendous personal magnetism quickly gain notoriety as jettatori. Pope Pius IX was dreaded for his evil eye, and a whole cycle of stories about the disasters that happened in his wake were current in Rome during the latter decades of the 19th century. Public figures of every type, from poets to gangsters, have had their specialized abilities attributed to the power of their eyes.

====Malta====
The symbol of the eye, known as , is common on traditional fishing boats which are known as . They are said to protect fishermen from storms and malicious intentions.

====Brazil====
Brazilian people generally associate (&quot;act of giving a bad look&quot;) or &quot;&quot; (, i.e. &quot;gluttonous eye&quot;) with envy or jealousy on domestic and garden plants (that, after months or years of health and beauty, will suddenly weaken, wither and die, with no apparent signs of pest, after the visitation of a certain friend or relative), attractive hair and less often economic or romantic success and family harmony.

Unlike in most cultures is not seen to be something that risks young babies. &quot;Pagans&quot; or non-baptized children are instead assumed to be at risk from (witches), that have malignant intention themselves rather than just . It probably reflects the Galician folktales about the (witches), as Colonial Brazil was primarily settled by Portuguese people, in numbers greater than all Europeans to settle pre-independence United States. These witches are interpreted to have taken the form of moths, often very dark, that disturb children at night and take away their energy. For that reason, Christian Brazilians often have amulets in the form of crucifixes around, beside or inside beds where children sleep.

Nevertheless, older children, especially boys, who rather fulfill the cultural ideals of good behavior quite well (for example, having no problems whatsoever in eating well a great variety of foods, being obedient and respectful toward adults, kind, polite, studious, and demonstrating no bad blood with other children or their siblings) but yet unexpectedly turn into problematic adolescents or adults (for example lacking good health habits, extreme laziness or lacking motivation towards their life goals, having eating disorders, or being prone to delinquency), are said to have been victims of coming from parents of children whose behavior was not as admirable.

Amulets that protect against tend to be generally resistant, mildly to strongly toxic and dark plants in specific and strategic places of a garden or the entry to a house. Those include: the common rue, chili peppers, &quot;Dieffenbachia seguine&quot;, &quot;Sansevieria trifasciata&quot;, and &quot;Petiveria alliacea&quot;. For those lacking in space or wanting to &quot;sanitize&quot; specific places, they may all be planted together in a single (&quot;seven [lucky] herbs&quot;) pot, that will also include basil and rosemary. It is, however, said that, when used in a home or any other place for protecting against the evil eye, these plants should not also be used for their culinary purposes.

Other popular amulets used in Brazilian folk traditions against evil eye include: the use of mirrors, on the outside of your home&#x27;s front door, or also inside your home facing your front door; an elephant figurine with its back to the front door; and coarse salt, placed in specific places at home.

====Spain and Latin America====
The evil eye () has been deeply embedded in Spanish popular culture throughout its history and Spain is the origin of this superstition in Latin America.

In Mexico and Central America, infants are considered at special risk for the evil eye and are often given an amulet bracelet as protection, typically with an eye-like spot painted on the amulet. Another preventive measure is allowing admirers to touch the infant or child; in a similar manner, a person wearing an item of clothing that might induce envy may suggest to others that they touch it or some other way dispel envy.

One traditional cure in Latin America involves a (folk healer) sweeping a raw chicken egg over the body of a victim to absorb the power of the person with the evil eye. The egg is later broken into a glass with water and placed under the bed of the patient near the head. Sometimes it is checked immediately because the egg appears as if it has been cooked. When this happens it means that the patient did have an evil eye. Somehow the evil eye has transferred to the egg and the patient immediately gets well. Fever, pain and diarrhea, nausea/vomiting goes away instantly. In the traditional Hispanic culture of the Southwestern United States and some parts of Latin America, the egg may be passed over the patient in a cross-shaped pattern all over the body, while reciting &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. The egg is also placed in a glass with water, under the bed and near the head, sometimes it is examined right away or in the morning and if the egg looks like it has been cooked then it means that they did have an evil eye and the patient will start feeling better. Sometimes if the patient starts getting ill and someone knows that they had stared at the patient, usually a child, if the person who stared goes to the child and touches them, the child&#x27;s illness goes away immediately so the evil eye energy is released.

In some parts of South America the act of (&#x27;to give someone the evil eye&#x27;) is an involuntary act. Someone may babies, animals and inanimate objects just by staring and admiring them. This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It is a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the &quot;heavy look&quot;, the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, in order to attract the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.

=====Mexico=====

Differently from other cultures, in Mexico it is believed that the (&quot;evil eye&quot;; literally, &quot;evil of the eye&quot; or &quot;illness of the eye&quot;) can be caused by someone&#x27;s glance even without any jealousy, envy or evil intention on said person&#x27;s part. The idea of is therefore connected to other traditional beliefs in the country regarding a supposed underlying sense of insecurity and relative vulnerability to powerful, hostile forces in the environment.

In a study of medical attitudes in the Santa Clara Valley of California, which has many Mexican-descent inhabitants, Margaret Clark arrives at essentially the same conclusion: &quot;Among the Spanish-speaking folk of Sal si Puedes, the patient is regarded as a passive and innocent victim of malevolent forces in his environment. These forces may be witches, evil spirits, the consequences of poverty, or virulent bacteria that invade his body. The scapegoat may be a visiting social worker who unwittingly &#x27;cast the evil eye&#x27; ... Mexican folk concepts of disease are based in part on the notion that people can be victimized by the careless or malicious behavior of others&quot;.

Another aspect of the syndrome in Ixtepeji is a disturbance of the hot-cold equilibrium in the victim. According to folk belief, the bad effects of an attack result from the &quot;hot&quot; force of the aggressor entering the child&#x27;s body and throwing it out of balance. Currier has shown how the Mexican hot-cold system is an unconscious folk model of social relations upon which social anxieties are projected. According to Currier, &quot;the nature of Mexican peasant society is such that each individual must continuously attempt to achieve a balance between two opposing social forces: the tendency toward intimacy and that toward withdrawal. [It is therefore proposed] that the individual&#x27;s continuous preoccupation with achieving a balance between &#x27;heat&#x27; and &#x27;cold&#x27; is a way of reenacting, in symbolic terms, a fundamental activity in social relations.&quot;

=====Puerto Rico=====

In Puerto Rico, is believed to be caused when someone gives a wicked glare of jealousy to someone, usually when the person receiving the glare is unaware. The jealousy can be disguised into a positive aspect such as compliments or admiration. is considered a curse and illness. It is believed that without proper protection, bad luck, injury, and illness are expected to follow. impact is believed to affect speech, relationships, work, family and most notably, health. Since centers around envy and compliments, it creates fear of interacting with people that are outside of their culture. Indirect harm could be brought to them or their family. When it comes to children, they are considered to be more susceptible to and it is believed that it can weaken them, leading to illness. As a child grows every effort is taken to protect them. When diagnosing , it is important to notice the symptoms. Physical symptoms can include: loss of appetite, body weakness, stomach ache, insomnia, fever, nausea, eye infections, lack of energy, and temperament.

Environmental symptoms can include financial, family, and personal problems as simple as a car breaking down. It is important for those who believe to be aware of anything that has gone wrong because it may be linked to . Puerto Ricans are protected through the use of Azabache bracelets. can also be avoided by touching an infant when giving admiration. The most common practice of protection in Puerto Rico is the use of Azabache bracelets. These bracelets traditionally have a black or red coral amulet attached. The amulet is in the shape of a fist with a protruding index finger knuckle.

Eggs are the most common method to cure . The red string and oils also used are more common in other cultures but still used in Puerto Rico depending on the Healer, or the person who is believed to have the ability to cure those who have been targeted. Ultimately, the act of giving someone the &quot;Evil Eye&quot; is a rather simple process and is practiced throughout the world.

====United States====
In 1946, the American occultist Henri Gamache published a text called &quot;Terrors of the Evil Eye Exposed!&quot; (later reprinted as &quot;Protection against Evil&quot;), which offers directions to defend oneself against the evil eye.

== Use in contemporary Western culture ==
The evil eye as a symbol has been recently used extensively in fashion and popular culture as a simplified symbol of general protection. Some consider its use in fashion as a form of feminine empowerment despite the traditional thought that women are more likely to receive the curse. However, others view the use of symbol in modern western culture as cultural appropriation. The symbol was used in the fall 2016 collections of fashion designers and companies, Alexander McQueen, Givenchy, and Chanel. American fashion model Gigi Hadid, released a shoe collection collaboration with luxury fashion designer, Stuart Weitzman featuring the evil eye symbol in 2017. The symbol has been used many more times in fashion since the 2010s such as its use in Chanel&#x27;s AW16 eyewear campaign, on dresses in the spring 2017 couture collection, and Coach 1941&#x27;s 2019 Cruise collection to name a few examples.

<text>During the Spanish–American War, the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and United States Navy fought 30 significant battles against the Spanish Army and Spanish Navy. Of these, 27 occurred in the Caribbean theater and three in the Pacific theater. The Caribbean theater consisted of two campaigns — the Puerto Rico campaign, which had ten battles, and the Cuba campaign, with 17 battles — while the Pacific theater had one campaign — the Philippine campaign, with two battles — and the capture of Guam.

==Overview==

The United States Navy battleship was mysteriously sunk in Havana harbor on 15 February 1898; political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed the administration of Republican President William McKinley into a war that he had wished to avoid. Spain promised multiple times that it would reform the government of Cuba, but never delivered. The United States sent an ultimatum to Spain demanding that it surrender control of Cuba on 20 April. After the ultimatum was sent, Madrid declared war on 23 April and Washington responded with its own declaration two days later.

The main issue was Cuban independence; the ten-week war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. After the declaration of war, the U.S. Navy blockaded ports such as Havana and Cardenas. The Spanish attempted to lift the blockades on Cardenas and Matanzas, finally succeeding after failing once at Cardenas. Commodore Dewey successfully destroyed the Spanish Pacific Fleet in Manila Bay on May 1, but failed to land troops. The Navy also blockaded Puerto Rico and bombarded San Juan, but the Spanish attempted to lift this blockade, succeeding on the second attempt in June. The U.S. Marines also cut telegraph lines under the bay of Cienfuegos, but suffered heavy losses from Spanish fire. The U.S. also captured the port of Guantánamo Bay after a four-day battle, which ended on June 10.

U.S. expeditionary forces landed in Cuba on 22 June and skirmished successfully at Las Guasimas two days later. Meanwhile, the island of Guam was &quot;captured&quot; by the Americans, which consisted of raising of the American flag. The U.S. also attempted to land forces near Trinidad, but were repulsed by Spanish forces. The U.S. forces captured San Juan Heights, which overlooked Santiago de Cuba, after two battles at San Juan Hill and Kettle Hill, which was preceded by a smaller battle on the San Juan Hill&#x27;s right flank at El Caney. The Spanish also attempted to lift the blockade on the port of Manzanillo twice, but failed both times. The Spanish fleet also attempted to escape Santiago harbor, but was destroyed by U.S. gunboats and armored cruisers. After this victory, U.S. forces laid siege to Santiago de Cuba for 14 days, until the Spanish forces surrendered, but there were several skirmishes afterwards. The Spanish managed to cut the United States blockade at Manzanillo, but the Americans sunk two Spanish ships at Nipe Bay. The Americans also tried to land at Mani-Mani, which was west of Havana, but were repulsed by the Spanish.

On 23 July, Americans landed close to the port of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Two days later, there was a small skirmish at Yauco, which was won by the Americans. The Spanish retreated and attempted to destroy rail lines to Ponce, but failed to. On 5 August, American forces marched into the town of Guayama, but the Spanish deserted the town several hours earlier. From 8 to 9 August, an American battalion captured the mountain at Coamo, Puerto Rico, on the road to the port of Ponce. At the same time, there was an inconclusive battle at Fajardo, which led to the capture and desertion of a lighthouse. One day later, the Americans captured Silva Heights. The Americans also landed near Mayaguez, and captured the town with no resistance. At the Battle of Asomante, the US forces took Asomante and captured many Spanish prisoners. At the same time, American forces also captured Manila. These two battles led to an armistice agreement, which quickly led to the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish–American War.

The 1898 Treaty of Paris, which was the result of the American victory in the war, was negotiated on terms favorable to the U.S. which allowed it temporary direct control of Cuba and ceded ownership of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippine islands. The cession of the Philippines involved payment of $20 million ($ today) to Spain in order to cover the Spanish infrastructure. The U.S. installed a military government in Cuba immediately after the Treaty of Paris, and eventually let it become an independent republic in 1902. The Philippines also rebelled against U.S. control, which led to the Philippine–American War lasting from 1899 to 1902. The Spanish also sold the rest of their Pacific islands to Germany under the German–Spanish Treaty.

<text>Machine embroidery is an embroidery process whereby a sewing machine or embroidery machine is used to create patterns on textiles. It is used commercially in product branding, corporate advertising, and uniform adornment. It is also used in the fashion industry to decorate garments and apparel. Machine embroidery is used by hobbyists and crafters to decorate gifts, clothing, and home decor. Examples include designs on quilts, pillows, and wall hangings.

There are multiple types of machine embroidery. Free-motion sewing machine embroidery uses a basic zigzag sewing machine. Designs are done manually. Most commercial embroidery is done with link stitch embroidery. In link stitch embroidery, patterns may be manually or automatically controlled. Link Stitch embroidery is also known as chenille embroidery, and was patented by Pulse Microsystems in 1994. More modern computerized machine embroidery uses an embroidery machine or sewing/embroidery machine that is controlled with a computer that embroiders stored patterns. These machines may have multiple heads and threads.

== History ==

Before computers were affordable, most machine embroidery was completed by punching designs on paper tape that then ran through an embroidery machine. One error could ruin an entire design, forcing the creator to start over. 

Machine embroidery dates back to 1964 when Tajima started to manufacture and sell TAJIMA Multi-head Automatic Embroidery machines. In 1973, Tajima introduced the TMB Series 6-needle (6 colors) full-automatic color-change embroidery machine. In 1978, Tajima started manufacturing the TMBE Series Bridge Type Automatic Embroidery machines. These machines introduced electronic 6-needle automatic color change technology.

In 1980 the first computerized embroidery machines were introduced to the home market. Wilcom introduced the first computer graphics embroidery design system to run on a minicomputer. Melco, an international distribution network formed by Randal Melton and Bill Childs, created the first embroidery sample head for use with large Schiffli looms. These looms spanned several feet across and produced lace patches and large embroidery patterns. The sample head allowed embroiderers to avoid manually sewing the design sample and saved production time. Subsequently, it became the first computerized embroidery machine marketed to home sewers.

The economic policy of the Reagan presidency helped propel Melco to the top of the market. At the Show of the Americas in 1980, Melco unveiled the Digitrac, a digitizing system for embroidery machines. The digitized design was composed at six times the size of the embroidered final product. The Digitrac consisted of a small computer, mounted on an X and Y axis on a large whiteboard. It sold for $30,000. The original single-needle sample head sold for $10,000 and included a 1&quot; paper-tape reader and 2 fonts. The digitizer marked common points in the design to create elaborate fill and satin stitch combinations.

In 1982, Tajima introduced the world&#x27;s first electronic chenille embroidery machine, called the TMCE Series Multi-head Electronic Chenille Embroidery Machine. In the same year, they developed the automatic frame changer, a dedicated apparatus for rolled textile embroidery. Also in 1982, Pulse Microsystems introduced Stitchworks, the first PC based embroidery software, and the first software based on outlines rather than stitches. This was monumental to decorators, in that it allowed them to scale and change the properties and parts of their designs easily, on the computer. Designs were output to paper tape, which was read by the embroidery machine. Stitchworks was sold worldwide by Macpherson.

Melco patented the ability to sew circles with a satin stitch, as well as arched lettering generated from a keyboard. An operator digitized the design using similar techniques to punching, transferring the results to a 1&quot; paper tape or later to a floppy disk. This design would then be run on the embroidery machine, which stitched out the pattern. Wilcom enhanced this technology in 1982 with the introduction of the first multi-user system, which allowed more than one person to work on the embroidery process, streamlining production times.

In 1983, Tajima created the TMLE Series Multi-Head Electronic Lock Stitch Chenille Embroidery machine, followed by the TMEF Series 9-needle Type Electronic Embroidery Machine in 1984. In 1986, Tajima introduced the world&#x27;s first sequin embroidery machine, enabling designers to combine sequin embroidery with plain embroidery.

In 1987, Pulse Microsystems introduced a digital asset management application called DDS, which was a design librarian for embroidery machines. This made it more efficient for machine operators to access their designs. In 1988 Tajima designed the TMLE-D5 series embroidery machines, with a pair arrangement of lock-stitch-handle embroidery heads, which were capable of sewing multiple threads.

Brother Industries entered the embroidery industry after several computerized embroidery companies contracted it to provide sewing heads. Pulse Microsystems developed software for them called PG1. PG1 had tight integration with the embroidery machine using high-level protocol, enabling the machine to pull designs from software, rather than having the software push designs to the machine. This approach is still used today. Melco was acquired by Saurer in 1989.

The early 1990s were quiet for machine embroidery, but Tajima introduced a 12 needle machine into their series along with a noise reduction mechanism.

In 1995, Tajima added a multi-color (6-color) type to chenille embroidery machines and announced the ability to mix embroidery machines with plain chenille embroidery. They also began sales of the TLFD Series Laser-cut Embroidery Machines. In 1996, Pulse Microsystems introduced the computational geometry-based simulation of hand-created chenille using a spiral effect. Following this in 1997, Tajima introduced 15-needle machines, in response to the &quot;multi-color-age&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Pulse Microsystems introduced networking to embroidery machines. It added a box, which allowed them to network and then pulls designs from a central server. It also provided machine feedback and allowed machines to be optically isolated to protect machines in an industrial environment. Since then, computerized machine embroidery has grown in popularity as costs have fallen for computers, software, and embroidery machines.

In the year 2000, Pulse Microsystems introduced Stitchport, which is a server-based embroidery engine for embroidery in a browser. This allowed for the factory automation of letter creation. Although they were not yet ready for it, this transformed the apparel industry by allowing manufacturers, stores, and end-users access to customized versions of the mass-produced garments and goods they had been buying throughout their lives, with no margin of error.

In 2001, Tajima created heater-wire sewing machines, which were innovative, combination machines.

In an environment that was finally ready for the individuality that mass customization allowed, the principles developed for Stitchport were adapted in 2008 for the creation of PulseID. PulseID allows for the automation of personalization, even on the largest industrial scale.

In 2013, Tajima released the TMAR-KC Series Multi-Head Embroidery Machine, equipped with a digitally controlled presser foot.

The major embroidery machine companies and software developers are continuing to adapt their commercial systems to market them for home use, including Janome, RNK, Floriani, Tacony Corporation and many more. As costs have fallen for computers, software and home market embroidery machines, the popularity of machine embroidery as a hobby has risen, and as such, many machine manufacturers sell their own lines of embroidery patterns. In addition, many individuals and independent companies also sell embroidery designs, and there are free designs available on the internet.

== Types of machine embroidery ==
=== Free-motion machine embroidery ===
In free-motion machine embroidery, embroidered designs are created by using a basic zigzag sewing machine. As this type of machine is used primarily for tailoring, it lacks the automated features of a specialized machine. The first zigzag sewing machine was patented by Helen Blanchard. To create free-motion machine embroidery, the embroiderer runs the machine and skillfully moves tightly hooped fabric under the needle to create a design. The &quot;feed dogs&quot; or machine teeth are lowered or covered, and the embroiderer moves the fabric manually. The embroiderer develops the embroidery manually, using the machine&#x27;s settings for running stitch and fancier built-in stitches. A machine&#x27;s zigzag stitch can create thicker lines within a design or be used to create a border. As this is a manual process rather than a digital reproduction, any pattern created using free-motion machine embroidery is unique and cannot be exactly reproduced, unlike with computerized embroidery.

=== Cornely hand-guided embroidery ===
This embroidery inherited the name of the Cornely machine. Created in the 19th century to imitate the Beauvais stitch (chain stitch), it is still used today, especially in the fashion industry. Cornely embroidery is a so-called hand-guided embroidery. The operator directs their machine according to the pattern. The fabric is moved by a crank located under the machine. The Cornely also has a universal drive system controlled by a handle. Some models can embroider sequins, cords, braids, etc. There are also Cornely machines performing a classic straight stitch.

=== Computerized machine embroidery ===
Most modern embroidery machines are computer controlled and specifically engineered for embroidery. Industrial and commercial embroidery machines and combination sewing-embroidery machines have a hooping or framing system that holds the framed area of fabric taut under the sewing needle and moves it automatically to create a design from a pre-programmed digital embroidery pattern.

Depending on its capabilities, the machine will require varying degrees of user input to read and sew embroidery designs. Sewing-embroidery machines generally have only one needle and require the user to change thread colors during the embroidery process. Multi-needle industrial machines are generally threaded prior to running the design and do not require re-threading. These machines require the user to input the correct color change sequence before beginning to embroider. Some can trim and change colors automatically.

== The computerized machine embroidery process ==

Machine embroidery is a multi-step process with many variables that impact the quality of the final product, including the type of fabric to be embellished, design size, stabilizer choice and type of thread utilized. The basic steps for creating embroidery with a computerized embroidery machine are as follows:
* Create an embroidery &quot;design&quot; file or purchase a stitchable machine embroidery file. Creation may take hours depending on the complexity of the design, and the software can be costly.
* Edit the design and/or combine with other designs.
* Export the design file to a (proprietary machine) embroidery file that mostly just contains commands for the embroidery machine. If you bought such a file, you may have to convert the file.
* Load the embroidery file into the embroidery machine, making sure it is the correct format for the machine and that the stitched design will fit in the appropriate hoop.
* Determine and mark the location of embroidery placement on the fabric to be embellished.
* Secure the fabric in a hoop with the appropriate stabilizer, and place it on the machine.
* Center the needle over the start point of the design.
* Start and monitor the embroidery machine, watching for errors and issues. Troubleshoot any problems as they arise. The operator should have plenty of needles, bobbins, a can of air (or small air compressor), a small brush, and scissors.
* Remove the completed design from machine. Separate the fabric from the hoop and trim the stabilizer, loose threads, etc.

<text>Bernard H. Haggin (December 29, 1900 – May 28, 1987) was an American journalist and music critic.

==Early life==
Haggin was born in New York City, on December 29, 1900, the son of Samuel Hurwitz and Tonie Herschman Hurwitz. He went to school in Manhattan and, too young for conscription in World War I, completed his high school education in 1918. He went on to the City College of New York, where he graduated in 1922. The following year he published his first music review.

==Career==
Haggin wrote as a freelance, reviewing music and dance, until October 1934, when he was appointed music critic of the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, retaining the post until 1937. From 1936 to 1957 he was music critic of the weekly magazine &quot;The Nation&quot;. &quot;The American National Biography&quot; says of his work there: &quot;Not given to self-doubt, Haggin attributed the reputation he earned in the &quot;Nation&quot; to &#x27;a musician&#x27;s ear, and an ability to assemble words in orderly, clear statements&#x27;&quot;. &lt;br&gt;

From 1946 to 1949, at the invitation of Virgil Thomson, its chief music critic, Haggin contributed a column about music on the radio for &quot;The New York Herald Tribune.&quot; After his tenure at The Nation ended, he reviewed music and ballet for &quot;The Hudson Review&quot; from 1958 to 1972, records for &quot;The New Republic&quot; from 1958 to 1966 and music from 1975 to 1978, and records for &quot;The Yale Review&quot; until 1985, among other publications. &lt;br&gt;

He wrote twelve books on music and two on ballet. He was the author of the first general guide to recorded classical music, &quot;Music on Records&quot; (1938), later expanded as &quot;The Listener&#x27;s Musical Companion&quot; (1956, 1967 and 1971). 

Haggin died in Manhattan on 28 May 1987 after a short illness, age 86 years. He never married.

==Critical assessment==
Haggin&#x27;s ability to write short, clear reviews was an advantage at a time when the discursive columns of an earlier generation of critics such as William J. Henderson, James Huneker and Deems Taylor were less sought after by editors. Haggin said in an interview in 1980, &quot;The equipment I began with was a musician&#x27;s ear, and an ability to assemble words in orderly, clear statements, and this remained the equipment with which, as I continued, I heard more and wrote better&quot;. In the view of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, despite Haggin&#x27;s claim, his later writing was inferior to his early work.

Haggin&#x27;s prose was admired and sometimes praised by many of his contemporaries, but his rigid views were less well received by his fellow critics. His obituarist in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:

<doc id="251815" wikidata="Q1501524" url="?curid=251815" title="Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; is the seventh episode of the sixth season of the supernatural drama television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003), and the only one in the series that is a musical. It was written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon and originally aired on UPN in the United States on November 6, 2001.

&quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; explores changes in the relationships of the main characters, using the plot device that a demon—credited as &quot;Sweet&quot; but unnamed in the episode—compels the people of Sunnydale to break into song at random moments to express hidden truths. The musical format allowed characters to stay true to their natures while they struggled to overcome deceit and miscommunication, fitting with the sixth season&#x27;s themes of growing up and facing difficulties in adulthood.

All of the regular cast performed their own vocals, although two actors were given minimal singing at their request. &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; is the most technically complex episode in the series, as extra voice and dance training for the cast was interspersed with the production of four other &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes. It was Whedon&#x27;s first attempt at writing music, and different styles—from 1950s sitcom theme music to rock opera—express the characters&#x27; secrets in specific ways. The episode received critical acclaim, particularly for the organic integration of the musical format and its humor and wit. It is considered one of the most effective and popular episodes of the series, and one of the best episodes of television. Prior to a financial dispute in 2007, it was shown in theaters with the audience invited to sing along.

==Background==
Throughout the series Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), in her role as the Vampire Slayer, is assisted by her close friends, who refer to themselves as the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot;. These include Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), a young man without particular strengths or talents, but devoted to Buffy and her calling, and Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), a young woman who has grown from a shy but gifted student into a strong woman and powerful user of magic. They are mentored by Buffy&#x27;s &quot;Watcher&quot;, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), a paternal figure since the first season, when Buffy moved to Sunnydale after her parents&#x27; divorce. Xander is engaged to Anya Jenkins (Emma Caulfield), a former vengeance demon who has become human. They have struggled with disclosing their engagement to the rest of the group and individually doubt their impending marriage.

Buffy died at the end of the fifth season (&quot;The Gift&quot;), sacrificing herself in place of her younger sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) in order to save the world. In the first episode of the sixth season, Willow, believing Buffy to be in Hell, used magic to bring her back from the grave. Buffy was in fact at peace, in what she thinks was heaven, but she has kept this a secret from her friends. Since her resurrection, Buffy has been lost and without inspiration to perform her duties as a Slayer. Willow is romantically involved with Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), a powerful but ethical witch. Tara has previously expressed concern at Willow&#x27;s use of her emergent magical powers for trivial or personal matters. In the preceding episode (&quot;All the Way&quot;), Willow cast a spell to make Tara forget an argument about her abuse of magic. In the same episode, Dawn, who has been stealing from stores, including Anya&#x27;s magic shop, lies to Buffy and goes on a clandestine and almost deadly date. Left to take care of Dawn after the death of their mother Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) in the fifth season (&quot;The Body&quot;), Buffy has come to depend more heavily on Giles. Following Dawn&#x27;s date, Buffy asks Giles to shoulder responsibility for disciplining her, much to his discomfort.

Buffy&#x27;s former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In the fourth season The Initiative, a secret military organization whose mission is to evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy&#x27;s side, after at first fighting just for the pleasure of brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he had fallen in love with Buffy. She initially rejected him, but just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.

Throughout &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, music serves as a narrative tool, integral to character development and action. The mood is set by music, characters discuss it, and writers use it to emphasize differences between generations. In an essay on the use of music in the series, Jacqueline Bach writes that in conjunction with the sixth season themes of growing up, &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; gives music a central role instead of keeping it in the background.

==Plot==
When Buffy is on patrol, she laments in song about how uninspired her life has become (&quot;Going Through the Motions&quot;). The next morning at the Magic Box, the gang reveal that they also sang that evening. Led by Giles, the gang theorizes about the cause of the singing; they sense no immediate danger but agree that by working together they can overcome anything (&quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Theory&quot;/&quot;Bunnies&quot;/&quot;If We&#x27;re Together&quot;). Buffy learns that the whole town is affected when she looks outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer David Fury) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service got their stains out (&quot;The Mustard&quot;).

Tara and Willow leave to &quot;research&quot; at home, but dally along the way while Tara muses about how much Willow has improved her life (&quot;Under Your Spell&quot;). The next morning, Xander and Anya perform a duet about their secret annoyances with each other and their respective doubts about their impending marriage (&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Tell&quot;). They realize that the songs are bringing out hidden secrets, and later insist to Giles that something evil is to blame. As they argue, they walk past a woman (series writer and producer Marti Noxon) protesting a parking ticket (&quot;The Parking Ticket&quot;). That evening, Buffy visits Spike, who angrily tells Buffy to leave him alone if she will not love him (&quot;Rest in Peace&quot;).

Dawn tells Tara she is glad that Tara and Willow have made up after their argument. Since Tara has no recollection of an argument, she suspects that Willow has used magic to alter her memory. She goes to the Magic Box to consult a book, leaving Dawn alone. Dawn, contemplating a collection of objects that she has stolen, including the charm that summoned Sweet, starts to bemoan that no one seems to notice her (&quot;Dawn&#x27;s Lament&quot;), but is soon seized by a group of minions. They take Dawn to The Bronze, where her attempt to escape transforms into an interpretive dance with them (&quot;Dawn&#x27;s Ballet&quot;) before she meets Sweet (Hinton Battle), a zoot suit-wearing, tap-dancing, singing demon. He tells Dawn that he has come to Sunnydale in response to her &quot;invocation&quot;, and he will take her to his dimension to make her his bride when his visit is complete but when Dawn reveals that her sister is the Slayer, he sends his minions to challenge her to rescue Dawn (&quot;What You Feel&quot;).

At the Magic Box, Giles recognizes that he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her responsibilities in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him (&quot;Standing&quot;) and Tara finds a picture of the Lethe’s bramble flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow&#x27;s magical manipulation of their relationship (&quot;Under Your Spell&quot;/&quot;Standing&quot; (reprise)). When one of Sweet&#x27;s minions tells Buffy about Sweet holding Dawn at The Bronze, Giles forbids the gang to assist her, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger (&quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;).

Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy offers a deal to Sweet: she will take her sister&#x27;s place if she cannot kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning (&quot;Something to Sing About&quot;). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at realizing what she has done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet&#x27;s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her that the only way to go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, invoked Sweet, hoping for a musical &quot;happy ending&quot; for his marriage plans and unaware of the demon&#x27;s deadly nature. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet&#x27;s &quot;bride&quot;, tells the group how much fun they have been (&quot;What You Feel&quot; (reprise)) and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs (&quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot;). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss (&quot;Coda&quot;).

==Production and writing==
Joss Whedon had wanted to make a musical episode since the start of the series. This desire was heightened during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon knew he would have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. During the first three seasons of &quot;Buffy&quot;, he was unable to take more than two weeks off at a time, and the constraints of writing and directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show&#x27;s producer, Gareth Davies, about his idea; they agreed that a musical episode would be written.

Whedon spent six months writing the music for &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;. When he returned after the end of the fifth season, he presented Davies with a script and CD, complete with notated and orchestrated music, which Davies found &quot;mind-boggling&quot;. The actors were initially bewildered; in 2012, James Marsters commented that &quot;it&#x27;s obvious now that they were good songs but the thing was Joss and his wife Kai, they don&#x27;t sing very well. And they don&#x27;t play piano very well. The songs sounded really cheesy and horrible... We were saying, &#x27;Joss, you&#x27;re ruining our careers.&#x27;&quot;

Preparing for the episode was physically difficult for some of the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that &quot;It took something like 19 hours of singing and 17 hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes&quot; and she was so anxious about singing that she &quot;hated every moment of it&quot;. When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, &quot;I basically started to cry and said, &#x27;You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?&#x27; In the end, it was an incredible experience and I&#x27;m glad I did it. And I never want to do it again.&quot; Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle&#x27;s performance on Broadway in &quot;The Wiz&quot; that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up for the first time to give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as &quot;slick&quot;, smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Buffy&#x27;s dance.

Running eight minutes longer than any in the series, the episode was also the most technical and complex. Whedon, who has stated this is one of his favorite &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes, used a widescreen letterboxed format for filming (the only episode in the series to get this treatment), different lighting to bring out the sets more vibrantly, and long takes for shooting—including a complicated shot with a full conversation, a song, and two choreographed dances that took 21 attempts to get right. These were designed to give viewers all the clues they needed to establish all the nuances of the relationships between characters. Davies commented that the intricacies of filming this episode were &quot;infinitely more complicated than a regular &quot;Buffy&quot;&quot; episode, and Whedon stated in the DVD commentary that he was ambitious to prove what television is capable of, saying &quot;it just depends how much you care&quot;. UPN, the television network that aired &quot;Buffy&quot;″s last two seasons, promoted the episode by displaying Gellar&#x27;s face on billboards with music notes over her eyes, and held a special premiere event. Network president Dean Valentine remarked he thought it was &quot;one of the best episodes of television I ever saw in my life&quot;.

Critics hailed the episode as successful in telling a complex story about all the characters in a unique way, while retaining the series&#x27; effective elements of writing and character development. Throughout the show—as in the rest of the series—the characters self-consciously address their own dialogue and actions. Anya describes her own duet &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Tell&quot; as &quot;a retro pastiche that&#x27;s never gonna be a breakaway pop hit&quot;. With a characteristic dry demeanor, Giles explains that he overheard the information about Sunnydale residents spontaneously combusting as he was eavesdropping upon the police taking &quot;witness arias&quot;. In her opening number, &quot;Going Through the Motions&quot;, Buffy sings that she feels as though she is playing a part: &quot;nothing here is real, nothing here is right&quot;. The song introduces the character&#x27;s emotional state but also removes the barrier between the actor and the audience, as Gellar the actor portrays Buffy, who feels she is merely playing the part of the Slayer. This hints to the audience that the episode&#x27;s musical format is strange to the actors and characters. According to &quot;Buffy&quot; essayist Richard Albright, the lack of polish among cast members&#x27; singing voices added to the authenticity of their breaking out into song for the first time in the series. Whedon included self-conscious dialogue and references about the characters being in a musical and showed their reluctance toward song and dance, so that the audience would feel more comfortable with the improbability of such a thing happening on the show.

==Themes==
The dynamic nature of the characters was a unique element of writing in the series at the time. Once they were established in the twelve episodes of the first season, characters began to change and relationships were developed in the second. This continued through the series to the point of unpredictability that sometimes became unsettling to fans. &quot;Buffy&quot; essayist Marguerite Krause asserts that the monsters and demons faced by the Scoobies are thin symbolism for the show&#x27;s true focus: relationships and how to maintain or ruin them. Common among most of these relationships—romantic, platonic, and familial—is, according to Krause, a &quot;failure to communicate, lack of trust, [and the] inability to envision or create a viable future&quot;. Miscommunication is worsened or sustained through multiple episodes and seasons, leading to overwhelming misunderstanding and critical turning points for the characters, some of whom do not recover.

&quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; propelled the story arc for season six by allowing characters to confess previously taboo issues to themselves and each other. Whedon commented that he was &quot;obsessive about progressing a plot in a song, about saying things we haven&#x27;t said&quot;, comparing the musical theater format to the fourth-season episode &quot;Hush&quot;, in which characters begin communicating when they stop talking. According to &quot;Buffy&quot; essayist Zoe-Jane Playdon, earlier episodes&#x27; &quot;false saccharine behaviour&quot; impedes the characters so crucially that it summons a demon to force them to be honest. The consequences in the episode of concealing truth, spontaneous combustion, is an allusion to &quot;Bleak House&quot; by Charles Dickens—of whom Whedon is a fan—where characters also face immolation for being deceitful. For Buffy, however, truth is slow in coming, as she continues to lie to the Scoobies, claiming to forget what she sang about in the graveyard during &quot;Going Through the Motions&quot;. Buffy continues her charade in the chorus number &quot;If We&#x27;re Together&quot;, beginning the song by persuading others to join in one by one, as if each is convinced that she is still invested and in charge, and their strength as a group is infallible. Although she asks in verse &quot;Apocalypse / We&#x27;ve all been there / The same old trips / Why should we care?&quot;, all the Scoobies join her, including Giles despite his suspicions that Buffy is no longer interested in her life.

Secrets reveal themselves steadily throughout the episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn him into an argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Tell&quot;, singing &quot;&#x27;coz there&#x27;s nothing to tell&quot;, after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya&#x27;s accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about what being married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang &quot;a breakaway pop hit, or a book number&quot;, and asking Dawn if the pterodactyl she facetiously says she gave birth to also broke into song. Anya and Xander&#x27;s duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander talk over each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying &quot;It was like we were being watched ... Like there was a wall missing ... in our apartment ... Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall.&quot; Albright asserts that Anya&#x27;s constant preoccupation with her and others&#x27; performances indicates that she has serious doubts about her future supporting role as Xander&#x27;s wife.

Giles&#x27; truth, according to Whedon, is that he realizes he must not &quot;fight my kid&#x27;s battles or my kid will never grow up&quot;, which he sings in &quot;Standing&quot; while he throws knives at Buffy as part of her training. Whedon remarked that this touch &quot;is the kind of complete turnaround that is a staple of the &quot;Buffy&quot; universe&quot;. Tara&#x27;s heartfelt love song also has an ironic subtext; although she appears to mean that she is fulfilled by her relationship with Willow, the lyrics include multiple allusions to Willow working her manipulative will over Tara, overlaid with Tara&#x27;s euphoric singing about her pleasure in their union. In &quot;Sex and the Slayer&quot;, Lorna Jowett calls the song between Willow and Tara the transformational event in their relationship, from Tara&#x27;s subservient bearing towards Willow, into a relationship of equals. Two &quot;Buffy&quot; essayists note that Willow and Giles sing together at the start of the episode, but later Tara and Giles share a duet to express the diminished part each plays in their respective relationships.

Although &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; allows all the characters to confess truthfully, with the exception of Willow, it does not resolve the behavior that demanded confession in the first place. At the end of the episode, Buffy kisses Spike, initiating a romance that she hides from her friends. Their relationship lasts until the end of the series, marked for a time by Buffy&#x27;s loathing of him because he has no soul. Her relationship with Spike, however, allows her to feel lust and attraction, which she yearns for after being pulled back from a heavenly dimension. In &quot;The Psychology of Joss Whedon&quot;, Mikhail Lubyansky writes that, although Buffy&#x27;s first step toward re-engaging with her life is telling the Scoobies the truth in the song &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;, she does not find meaning again until the end of the season. In his essay &quot;A Kantian Analysis of Moral Judgment in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;&quot;, Scott Stroud explains that Buffy, as the central character throughout the series, is torn between her desires and her duty, in a Kantian illustration of free will vs. predeterminism, symbolized by her responsibility as a Slayer and her adolescent impulses. In earlier seasons, this takes the form of simpler pleasures such as dating and socializing, interspersed with defeating evil forces. It reaches a climax in the ultimate sacrifice when Buffy offers to die to save the world. However, &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, according to Stroud, is the turning point at which she begins to face her responsibility to the community, her friends and her family. Not only does she continue her Slaying despite a lack of inspiration, but for the rest of the season she works at a humiliating job to provide for her sister and friends.

==Music and style==
&quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; was Joss Whedon&#x27;s first attempt at writing music, which he had always wanted to do. He learned how to play guitar to write several songs. Christophe Beck, a regular composer for the series, filled in the overture and coda and composed &quot;Dawn&#x27;s Ballet&quot;. Whedon is a fan of Stephen Sondheim, and used him as the inspiration for much of the music, particularly with the episode&#x27;s ambiguous ending. Cast member James Marsters (Spike) said, &quot;Some of Joss&#x27; music is surprisingly complicated. Maybe it&#x27;s a Beatles thing. He doesn&#x27;t know enough to know what he can&#x27;t do and he&#x27;s smashing rules.&quot;

The episode&#x27;s musical style varies significantly. Buffy&#x27;s opening number, &quot;Going Through the Motions&quot;, was influenced heavily by the Disney song &quot;Part of Your World&quot; sung by Ariel in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Whedon wanted to use a similar opening in which the heroine explains her yearning. While singing her song, Buffy fights three vampires and a demon who themselves break into a choreographed dance; Whedon wanted this to be fun but not distracting. The song ends with chord influences from Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Pippin&quot; and a visual tribute to Disney: as Buffy stakes a vampire, it turns to dust that swirls around her face.

Whedon chose the most complicated scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song (&quot;The Mustard&quot;) &quot;to get it out of the way&quot; for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this &quot;brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre&#x27;s conventions&quot;. The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya&#x27;s hard-rock version of &quot;Bunnies&quot;. Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang in such a way to him on the set. Spike&#x27;s &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode&#x27;s first song, Tara&#x27;s &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;, a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya&#x27;s duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles&#x27; &quot;Standing&quot; is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles&#x27; distance from her. Buffy&#x27;s not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, &quot;You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never know how you feel or how much you love them, even if they&#x27;re standing right in front of you&quot;.

&quot;Under Your Spell&quot; received attention from Buffy studies writers because it presents a frank and unflinching expression of lesbian romance. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was the first show in U.S. television history to portray a long-term lesbian relationship among the core cast of characters. Previous televised depictions of lesbian relations were primarily limited to single &quot;coming out&quot; or &quot;lesbian kiss&quot; episodes, showing lesbian-identified characters as affectionate but not erotic. Tara and Willow demonstrate throughout the series, and specifically in &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, that they are &quot;intensely sexual&quot;, according to &quot;Buffy&quot; essayist Justine Larbalestier. Near the end of Tara&#x27;s song, she sings, &quot;Lost in ecstasy / Spread beneath my Willow tree / You make me / Com — plete&quot;, as Tara levitates off the bed while Willow tacitly performs cunnilingus on her. Lorna Jowett called the song &quot;the most erotic scene&quot; of the series. Whedon admitted on the DVD commentary for the episode that the song is &quot;pornography&quot; and &quot;probably the dirtiest lyric I&#x27;ve ever written, but also very, very beautiful&quot;.

&quot;Buffy&quot; essayist Ian Shuttleworth writes that Amber Benson (Tara) has &quot;the sweetest singing voice of all the lead players&quot;, referring to &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; as &quot;heavenly and salacious&quot;; author Nikki Stafford concurs, writing that Benson &quot;has the most stunning voice, showing a surprising range&quot;. Whedon acknowledged that the &quot;lyrical, heavenly quality&quot; of Benson&#x27;s voice led him to assign her the episode&#x27;s love song. Alyson Hannigan (Willow) was unwilling to sing much and her performance is &quot;apprehensive&quot;, according to Shuttleworth. He considers this an example of Tara&#x27;s quieter strength coming out in front of Willow&#x27;s showy demonstrations of powerful magic. Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox interprets Willow&#x27;s diminished role representing the show&#x27;s silence about Willow&#x27;s descent into addiction and darkness through the rest of the season. Benson remarked that Tara&#x27;s story arc is significant within the episode, starting out with ecstasy but soon recognizing the illusory circumstances surrounding her bliss and that &quot;life can&#x27;t be perfect all the time&quot;.

The most complicated song, &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;, leads all the characters to the climax from different locations for different reasons, reminiscent of the &quot;Tonight Quintet&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot;. When they all sing the chorus at once to the line &quot;We will walk through the fire / And let it — burn&quot;, two fire trucks race behind the Scoobies as they proceed to the Bronze. Whedon called the shot the &quot;single greatest thing we ever did&quot;. Each of the singers in this song, which &quot;marries soft rock to the function of a dirge&quot;, connects musically to earlier songs while foreshadowing Buffy&#x27;s next number and the final chorus, providing an ominous anxiety.

Buffy&#x27;s numbers are the most complex, changing key and tempo when she begins to reveal the secrets she swore she never would. This appears specifically in &quot;Something to Sing About&quot;, which starts with uptempo platitudes: &quot;We&#x27;ll sing a happy song / And you can sing along: / Where there&#x27;s life, there&#x27;s hope / Every day&#x27;s a gift / Wishes can come true / Whistle while you work ...&quot; While singing, she kills Sweet&#x27;s minions with a pool cue. Whedon attempted to make the song tuneful yet chaotic to express the main point of the episode. It transitions suddenly into her desire to be like normal girls, then changes again, slowing the tempo as she challenges Sweet not to give her a song, but &quot;something to sing about&quot;. Musicologist Amy Bauer categorizes the tempo shifts as &quot;rock ballad to punk polka to hymn&quot; that indicates Buffy&#x27;s turmoil. The key and tempo slow again, as Buffy finally reveals &quot;I live in hell / &#x27;Cause I&#x27;ve been expelled from heaven / I think I was in heaven&quot; with the chord changing from B minor to B diminished, each time she repeats &quot;heaven&quot;. When replying to her, Spike has the same shift from minor to diminished each time he repeats the word &quot;living.&quot;

The episode nears the end with &quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot;, as the Scoobies stand dazed and disoriented, facing different directions. As they sing &quot;Understand we&#x27;ll go hand in hand / But we&#x27;ll walk alone in fear&quot;, they line up, hold hands, then fling each other&#x27;s hands away in a piece of what Whedon calls &quot;literal choreography&quot;. Each of the eight characters in this line wears a color in the visible spectrum, a conscious decision by the costume designer. The couples in the group wear opposite colors (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox interprets the color-coding and choreography to represent the &quot;tension between the individual and the group&quot;. The characters as a chorus sing &quot;The curtains close on a kiss, God knows / We can tell the end is near&quot;, moments before Buffy runs out to kiss Spike and the show closes with actual curtains. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music accompanies them, similar to the ending of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Lyrics sung moments before, however, forecast the uncertainty of the relationship between Spike and Buffy, as well as their contrasting reasons for initiating any romance; Spike wants to feel love from Buffy, while she simply wants to feel.

==Reception==
When the episode was originally broadcast in the United States on UPN on November 6, 2001, it received a Nielsen rating of 3.4 and a share of 5. This placed the episode in sixth place in its timeslot, and 88th among broadcast television for the week of November 5–11, 2001. It was the most watched program on UPN that night, and the third most watched program that week, trailing episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; and &quot;WWF SmackDown&quot;. This was a decrease from the 3.7 rating received by the previous episode a week prior.

&quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; received widespread critical acclaim from media and critics when it aired, during overseas syndication, and in reminiscences of the best episodes of &quot;Buffy&quot; after the series ended. Although Salon.com writer Stephanie Zacharek states &quot;(t)he songs were only half-memorable at best, and the singing ability of the show&#x27;s regular cast ranged only from the fairly good to the not so great&quot;, she also asserts that it works &quot;beautifully&quot;, paces itself gracefully, and is &quot;clever and affecting&quot;. Zacharek&#x27;s unenthusiastic assessments of the music and cast&#x27;s singing abilities were not shared by other writers. Debi Enker in Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; writes, &quot;Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Tara (Amber Benson) are terrific, Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) struggle valiantly, and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) barely sings a note&quot;. Tony Johnston in &quot;The Sunday Herald Sun&quot; writes that Gellar &quot;struggles on some of her higher notes, but her dance routines are superb, Michelle Trachtenberg&#x27;s Dawn reveals sensual dance moves way beyond her tender years, and James Marsters&#x27; Spike evokes a sort of Billy Idol yell to disguise his lack of vocal proficiency [...] The rest of the cast mix and match like ready-made Broadway troupers.&quot; Johnston counts &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Tell&quot; as one of the episode&#x27;s &quot;standout moments&quot;. Connie Ogle in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; calls the songs &quot;better and far more clever than most of the ones you&#x27;ll hear on Broadway these days&quot;.

Writers agree that the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; writes &quot;What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level [...] It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he&#x27;s demonstrated for the past six seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the &#x27;Hey, wouldn&#x27;t it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?&#x27; approach practised by &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, the &quot;Buffy&quot; musical was entirely organic to the series&#x27; labyrinthine progression.&quot; Johnston in the &quot;Sunday Herald Sun&quot; says, &quot;There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off&quot;, while Debi Enker in &quot;The Age&quot; comments, &quot;Whedon demonstrates yet again what &quot;Buffy&quot; aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack.&quot; Steve Murray in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; characterizes the episode as &quot;scary in a brand-new way&quot;, saying &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; is &quot;as impressive as Whedon&#x27;s milestone episodes &#x27;Hush&#x27; and &#x27;The Body; the episode is &quot;often hilarious&quot;, according to Murray, and acts as &quot;(b)oth spoof and homage, [parodying] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires&quot;.

Scott Feschuk from &quot;National Post&quot; states that the episode &quot;conveyed the same sense of rampant, runaway genius—the rare fusion of artful storytelling and ardent entertainment, a production capable of moving viewers to tears or to an awestruck rapture&quot;. Writing in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Vinay Menon calls &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; &quot;dazzling&quot; and writes of &quot;Joss Whedon&#x27;s inimitable genius&quot;; he goes on to say &quot;(f)or a show that already violates conventions and morphs between genres, its allegorical narrative zigging and zagging seamlessly across chatty comedy, drama and over-the-top horror, &#x27;Once More, with Feeling&#x27; is a towering achievement [...] The show may be anchored by existential weightiness, it may be painted with broad, supernatural brushstrokes, but in the end, this coming-of-age story, filled with angst and alienation, is more real than any other so-called teen drama [...] So let&#x27;s add another line of gushing praise: &#x27;Once More, with Feeling&#x27; is rhapsodic, original, deeply affecting, and ultimately, transcendental. Quite simply, television at its best.&quot;

The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Musical Direction, but the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) neglected to include the title on the ballots for Emmy nominations in 2002. NATAS attempted to remedy this by mailing a postcard informing its voters that it should be included, but the episode did not win. NATAS&#x27; oversight, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, was &quot;another example of the lack of industry respect afforded one of television&#x27;s most consistently clever shows&quot;. Ogle in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; vigorously protests this omission, writing, &quot;[T]he most astonishing, entertaining hour (hour plus, actually) of TV in the past year slips by virtually unnoticed. Nothing here is real; nothing here is right. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;&#x27;s musical episode, &#x27;Once More, with Feeling&#x27;, registers a paltry outstanding music direction nomination. Nice for the musical directors. A stake through the aspirations of writer/director Joss Whedon, the beating creative heart of &quot;Buffy&quot;, the only TV writer brave and clever enough to use horror as one great big wonderful metaphor for growing up [...] &#x27;Once More, with Feeling&#x27; is TV of a different sort, something that comes along once in a lifetime and should not be buried but celebrated and rewarded.&quot; The episode was also nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation Hugo Award and a Best Script Nebula Award, both given for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. &quot;Vox&quot; ranked the episode as the best episode of the series. It was voted the best episode of the series in a poll conducted by &quot;Radio Times&quot; to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the finale episode &quot;Chosen&quot;. In 2009, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #14 on its list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 100 Episodes of All Time&quot;. For its 65th anniversary, &quot;TV Guide&quot; picked it as the fifth best episode of the 21st century. In 2021, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it the best musical episode ever made.

===Soundtrack===

An album including all 14 songs in the episode, with Christophe Beck&#x27;s scores for three other &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes, was released by Rounder Records in September 2002 as season seven premiered. John Virant, president and chief executive of Rounder Records, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;I remember watching the episode when it aired last October, and after it was over, I said to my wife, &#x27;That&#x27;s the best hour of TV I&#x27;ve ever seen. Someone should put that [soundtrack] out.&#x27; I inquired at Fox, just following up, and they said, &#x27;Well, we tried, it didn&#x27;t happen. If you want to take a run at it, feel free. The soundtrack received &quot;stellar reviews&quot;. AllMusic gives the album five out of five stars, stating that the music is &quot;every bit as fun as the episode itself&quot;, praising the voices of Benson, Marsters and Head. Reviewer Melinda Hill states it is &quot;a must-have for &quot;Buffy&quot; fans, but it wouldn&#x27;t be out of place in anyone&#x27;s collection&quot;.

===DVD releases===
In addition to featuring on the sixth season box set, &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; was individually released on DVD in Region 2 format on April 14, 2003, the only episode to be individually released. In Region 1, the episode was released on the sixth season box set on May 25, 2004, over a year later than the Region 2 release.

===Influence===
Since the musical episode of &quot;Buffy&quot; aired, several other series have worked musical format into episodes, including &quot;Scrubs&quot;, (&quot;My Musical&quot;) in 2007, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (&quot;Song Beneath the Song&quot;) in 2011, &quot;&quot;, (&quot;Mayhem of the Music Meister!&quot;) in 2009, and &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (&quot;Subspace Rhapsody&quot;) in 2023. The musical television episode was declared a genre, a gimmick, according to Mary Williams at Salon.com, for series that had run out of interesting story lines and characters. Both Williams and Margaret Lyons at &quot;New York&quot; magazine, however, declared &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; the &quot;gold standard&quot; for musical episodes. Despite this, Whedon recognized the influence &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; has had on other shows, but denied that it was primarily responsible for the rise in musical television episodes or series such as &quot;Glee&quot;, citing the popularity of &quot;High School Musical&quot; instead. Director John McPhail cited &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; as an influence on his musical film &quot;Anna and the Apocalypse&quot; (2018).

==Public showings==
&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; developed an enthusiastic fan following while it aired. Following its series finale, fans continued their appreciation in theater showings of &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; where attendees are encouraged to dress like the show&#x27;s characters, sing along to the musical numbers, and otherwise interact in the style of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. Clinton McClung, a New York-based film programmer, got the idea for a sing-along from audience-participation showings of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; in 2003. The next year, he began putting on sing-alongs to &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; in Boston&#x27;s Coolidge Corner Theater, which became so popular that it went on the road. Audience members received props to use during key scenes, as well as directions (for example, to yell &quot;Shut up, Dawn!&quot; at Buffy&#x27;s younger sister), and a live cast performed the episode alongside the screen.

&quot;Buffy&quot; sing-alongs received growing media attention as they spread. At the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival, a special screening and sing-along was held that featured both Marti Noxon and Joss Whedon giving brief speeches to the audience. In October 2007, after a dispute with the Screen Actors Guild over unpaid residuals, 20th Century Fox pulled the licensing for public screenings of &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, effectively ending official &quot;Buffy&quot; sing-alongs. Whedon called the cancellation &quot;hugely depressing&quot; and attempted to influence the studio to allow future showings.

<text>Walter Grimshaw (12 March 1832 – 27 December 1890) was a 19th-century British composer of chess problems. In 1854 he won the first ever chess problem composition tourney in London. He is perhaps best known for giving his name to the Grimshaw, a popular problem theme.

==Sample compositions==
This is one of his problems, a mate in five (white moves first, and must checkmate black within five moves against any defence) first published in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; in 1850. The key is 1.Bc8 which threatens 2.Qc5# or Qd2#. To defend, black plays 1...Bxc8 white plays 2.Qf6 (threatening 3.c4#) and now a Grimshaw interference comes into play: black can defend by cutting off the white queen from the defence of d6 with 2...Ne6 or 2...Be6, but this interferes with the rook&#x27;s guard of e5, and so allows 3.Qe5#. If instead black plays 2...Re6, this interferes with the bishop&#x27;s guard of f5 which is significant after 3.Qd4+ Kxd4 4.Nf5+, because the knight cannot be captured. Instead, there follows 4...Kd5 5.c4#.

The second example is one of Grimshaw&#x27;s better-known problems, a mate in three composed for a competition organised by the &quot;Chess Players Chronicle&quot;, 1852-54. The key is the paradoxical 1.Rf1, sacrificing a strong white piece. This carries the threats 2.Nf3 (leading to various mates delivered by the d5 rook) and 2.f3+ (leading to knight mates on f5 or g2). Black&#x27;s obvious defence, 1...exf1Q is answered by 2.Nf3 Kxf3 3.Rd2#. After 1...f3 (giving black a flight at f4), white plays his rook back to where it came from (a &quot;switchback&quot;) to take advantage of the newly opened fourth rank: 2.Rg1 any 3.Rg4#.

==Match Chess== 
A game by Grimshaw was already documented in 1853 in the &quot;British Chess Review&quot;. Grimshaw founded a chess club in Whitby, presumably around the year 1859, and remained its president until his death. He participated in several chess tournaments, mostly in Yorkshire, and seems to have been quite a good match player. It was even reported that around 1875, he won a private game in London against the later world champion Wilhelm Steinitz.

<doc id="251821" wikidata="Q1137022" url="?curid=251821" title="Götaland theory">
<text>The Götaland theory (or &quot;Westrogothian School&quot;, Swedish Västgötaskolan) is a view which challenges established history and archaeology, and claims that the foundation of Sweden occurred not (as traditionally assumed) in Eastern Sweden, but in the province of Westrogothia (Västergötland). The adherents of this idea use wide-ranging methods, from controversial ones, such as dowsing and asking mediums to contact the dead, to more conventional methods such as etymology, but also claim that the established academic material consists of lies and forgeries. Although well known in Sweden and fervently preached by its adherents, it has never been accepted by scholars.

== History ==
The Götaland theory originated in the early 20th century with claims that the ancient city Ubsola (&quot;Uppsala&quot;) was situated in the province of Västergötland, specifically in the old lands called &quot;Uplanden&quot;. Additionally, the theory&#x27;s supporters also held the view that Västergötland and the region of Lake Vänern was in fact the land of &quot;Sithun&quot;, translated into modern day language as &quot;Sigtuna&quot;, where Odin and his Aesir companions supposedly settled when they came to Scandinavia.

An early predecessor of the theory was Pehr Tham (1737–1820), who during the 19th century unsuccessfully tried to promote ideas such as the village Sätuna being the location of Old Sigtuna, and the ancient town of Birka being situated somewhere around Lake Hornborga. He is regarded as a successor of Olof Rudbeckius, a seventeenth-century scholar who claimed that Sweden was the true location of the sunken Atlantis.

The early proponents of the Götaland theory proposed ideas about Västergötland, and the Vänern lake region, in particular, being the origin not only of the Geats, but also of the Suiones, the Danes; and furthermore the location of various phenomena in Norse mythology, such as Odin&#x27;s Sithun (&quot;Sigtuna&quot;), Valhall, and the ash tree Yggdrasil. These ideas, created in the spirit of Romanticism, were also a reaction to the archaeological research at the time, which arguably neglected some areas of Sweden that were nevertheless rich in archaeological remains. The speculations of the adherents of the Götaland theory movement are largely irrelevant to modern academic discussion, which does not pay much attention to Swedish-Geatish wars or the Yngling kings.

Especially, the story of Odin and the Aesir&#x27;s emigration according to the Ynglinga saga is generally considered as false by the official views and scholars. Other parts of the extensive work of Snorri Sturluson (and other saga writers) may however be considered valid references for finding elements of the ancient history of Scandinavian people and their religious customs and beliefs.

==Birka speculations ==
The town Birka is also known from the &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot;, in which Ansgar founds a mission in the town. It is commonly referred to being on Björkö island in the lake Mälaren. This location is a World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction.

According to the Västgöta theory, &quot;Birka&quot; as a name meant &quot;merchant town,&quot; and could refer to any such town in ancient Sweden.

==&quot;Ubsola&quot; speculations ==
&quot;Upsalir&quot;, or &quot;Ubsola&quot;, was the main cult center of pagan (heathen) Ása-faith in ancient Scandinavia and Sweden. The ancient Upsalir was described by Adam of Bremen in the 11th century, and by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. It is generally considered to correspond to modern-day Uppsala, with its location on Uppsala&#x27;s old location – Old Uppsala, in east Sweden, the habitat of the ancient tribe called Suiones (Swedes). The Västgöta school however claims that the original site for the temple was located in West Sweden, in the habitat of the ancient Geats (&quot;Götar&quot;), the tribe which came to name &quot;Västergötland&quot;.

There are however no archeological findings that support the view of Västergötland being the original site of Ubsola, and therefore the views of the Västgöta theory have little or no actual credibility.

==The theory&#x27;s Nazi origin==
The Götaland theory was the only notable result of the Nazi infiltration of Swedish archaeology during 1933–1945. Carl-Otto Fast, founder of the Westrogothian School (&quot;Västgötaskolan&quot;), was a known Nazi who some claim collaborated with SS Ahnenerbe, Richard Walther Darré and eugenicists from Hadamar in Germany. Archaeologist Magnus Alkarp, who has studied classified and semi-classified documents from the post-war era, has showed that the Westrogothian School was, among some regional, right-wing separatists movements in Scandinavia, an important part of the Operation Gladio.

==Testing the theory==
Amateurs have unsuccessfully tried to prove what they consider important aspects of the Götaland theory several times. The barrow at Skalunda was claimed to be the burial site of the hero Beowulf known from the &quot;Beowulf&quot; epic; after applying the dowsing technique with a pendulum, they claimed that the barrow was indeed the burial site of this Geatish hero. Later, professional archaeologists drilled into the barrow to extract a sample for C14 dating. The barrow was from around 700 C.E., about 150 years too late for being a candidate for Beowulf&#x27;s burial site.

The locality Sätuna at the Lake Hornborga in Västergötland was, according to believers in the theory, the true Sigtuna, where king Olof Skötkonung had his coins made. A protrusion in the ground was pointed out by adherents of the Götaland theory as the king&#x27;s mint. However, when archaeologists examined it, the protrusion turned out to be the remains of an uncompleted barn from the 1890s.

<doc id="251826" wikidata="Q3151381" url="?curid=251826" title="Innis College, Toronto">
<text>Innis College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Toronto. It is one of the University of Toronto&#x27;s smallest colleges in terms of size and the second smallest college in terms of population with approximately 2000 registered students. It is located in the campus&#x27; historic west end, directly north of Robarts Library, and is named after prominent University of Toronto political economist Harold Innis.

The College includes a fully equipped cinema known as the Innis Town Hall, which hosts numerous film festivals, free film screenings, and a variety of other cultural events. It also serves as a venue for Hot Docs, which is North America&#x27;s largest documentary film festival.

==History==

Originally designed to be a wing (now Wetmore Hall) onto New College, Innis College was founded separately in 1964 as the second non-federated college to be formed under the University&#x27;s administration. Although initially located at the Macdonald-Mowatt house on St. George Street, the College has since relocated to a building on Sussex Avenue that incorporates a substantial Victorian home into a functional modern structure designed by Jack Diamond and Barton Myers. Innis was also the first University of Toronto college to host an open pub (1975) and the first one to sport an equity split between faculty and students on its governing council.

The current Principal of Innis College is Charlie Keil. The current Innis Registrar is Donald Boere.

==Students==
All Innis College students are members of the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto. Governing student bodies include the Innis College Council, the Innis College Student Society (ICSS), and the Innis Residence Council. 

Each September, Innis College participates in a campus-wide orientation event for first-year students. During the days leading up to the start of fall classes, students have the opportunity to take part in campus-wide activities, workshops, and team-building opportunities.

The Office of Student Life (OSL) at Innis College oversees various student support services. They offer health and wellness supports, assist students in finding community through clubs and activities, and direct the Innis Insider Mentorship Program. Innis College also offers an Alumni Mentorship Program that connects students with graduated and working Innis students. 

The Innis Registrar&#x27;s Office, located on the first floor of the college, serves as a reliable first-stop for students with questions pertaining to academics, finances, mental health, and beyond. Other student supports include the Innis Writing Centre, Learning Strategists, and Academic Advisors. 

Since 1965, &quot;The Innis Herald&quot; newspaper has served the Innis community with four published editions per academic year.
==Governance and services==

Innis College was the first college at the University of Toronto to have parity between students and faculty on its governing council. The main governing body of Innis College is the Innis College Council and operates under the Governing Council of the University of Toronto. The College Council is made up of students, administration, and other interest groups including the members of the later life learning program, and the alumni association to name a few. The council has many boards including boards on academic affairs, college affairs, student affairs, and community affairs. It is the job of the council to exercise the college&#x27;s autonomous rights granted to them by the University and therefore oversees admissions, awards, and academic programs offered by the college.

The students of Innis College as well as the engineers living in the Innis Residence are members of the Innis College Student Society (ICSS). The ICSS is represented by a governing body that offers student services, as well as social events held by the college. The governing body of the ICSS is made up of an executive body, student representatives, and operations directors, all of whom are students.

Innis College is home to the Cinema Studies Student Union (CINSSU) and the Urban Studies Student Union (URSSU); the representative unions of students enrolled in Cinema Studies and Urban Studies programs.

Innis College is watched over by an administrative staff consisting of the Principal&#x27;s Office and Registrar&#x27;s Office, as well as the Innis Town Hall and Innis College Library staff.

Innis College houses a student-run newspaper called &quot;The Innis Herald&quot; which publishes quarterly issues to the University of Toronto community. Their website has more current issues and there is a digital archive of &quot;The Innis Herald&#x27;s&quot; past issues (starting in 1965/1966).

==Academic programs==

All students of the College are enrolled in the Faculty of Arts and Science. Innis College also hosts several programs in the faculty, which are:
* Cinema Studies (Innis is home to the Cinema Studies Institute, which not only offers the undergraduate program, but also graduate programs: a one-year MA program and PhD program)
* Urban Studies
* Writing and Rhetoric (Minor)
* First Year Foundations (FYF) courses: Innis One Program and FYF@Innis Seminars

Innis College students are welcome to enrol in any program within the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, and any student in the Faculty may enrol in one (or more) of Innis&#x27; programs.

The College formerly hosted the Environmental Studies program before it was relocated to the University&#x27;s Centre for Environment.
==Innis Residence==

Vladimir House, the first Innis residence located at 651 Spadina Avenue, was replaced by a larger, modern residence in 1994. The Innis Residence was built in 1994 and is a modern apartment-style building with seven stories, located across the street from the College at 111 St. George Street. The building consists of four floors that form a U-shape around a courtyard, and two 3-story towers above them, on the north and south sides of the building. The building is suite-style - each suite contains a common kitchen, common living room, two shared bathrooms and 4-5 bedrooms. There are 327 spaces available for students in the building, which roughly consist of 60% first-year students and 40% upper-years. A number of spaces are also reserved for students from the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering.

The residence consists of six social communities known as houses. The houses are First House (named because it is located on the first floor of the building), Devonshire West House (named after the street that backs the residence to the east), Taddle Creek House (named after a buried stream that formerly flowed through Downtown Toronto), Vladimir House (named after the original Innis residence building), North House (named because it is located in the building&#x27;s north tower), and Ajax House (named after a University of Toronto&#x27;s former satellite campus in Ajax). These social communities hold inter-residence competitions to build unity and add to the student experience. Each house is overseen by Residence Dons. The residence also hires an Assistant Dean of Residence Life and a front desk staff that offers 24-hour security to the building. The residence is also home to a student-run Innis Residence Council (IRC).

The Innis Residence was the first university residence in North America to be wired for Internet access.

<text>The John P. Robarts Research Library, commonly referred to as Robarts Library, is the main humanities and social sciences library of the University of Toronto Libraries and the largest individual library in the university. Opened in 1973 and named for John Robarts, the 17th Premier of Ontario, the library contains more than 4.5 million bookform items, 4.1 million microform items and 740,000 other items.

The library building is an example of brutalist architecture. Its towering main structure rests on an equilateral triangular footprint and features extensive use of triangular geometric patterns throughout. It forms the main component of a three-tower complex that also includes the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library and the Claude T. Bissell Building, which houses the Faculty of Information. The library&#x27;s imposing appearance has earned it the nicknames Fort Book and The Peacock/Turkey.

==Architecture==

The design of the Robarts Library complex was headed by Mathers &amp; Haldenby Architects with consultation from Warner, Burns, Toan &amp; Lunde, the New York architectural firm whose earlier works included the libraries at Cornell and Brown universities and who specialized in precast concrete buildings. Coinciding with the Canadian Centennial celebrations, the initial plan was expanded to add three more storeys to the original design. Construction of the library began in 1968 and completed in 1973, at a cost of over $40 million.

Robarts Library occupies a site on a field of open space and mature tree cover. The building rests on an equilateral triangle footprint with each side measuring , the same length as a Canadian football field from goal post to goal post. The building is oriented such that one side of the equilateral triangle faces west while the other two sides face northeast and southeast. From the southeast corner, the building appears as a peacock.

The elevation is mostly concrete, albeit differing in textures and directionality: smooth concrete lines the façade in a horizontal manner, the rough concrete lining vertically. The steel-framed windows are situated onto the bays protruding from the façade, and are reminiscent of overhanging towers in medieval castle architecture. The bay windows seem to elevate upwards, opening up the two lowermost levels into voids enclosed with steel-framed glazing, making these elements seem lighter than they really are. To stretch further one&#x27;s imagination, it is as if these elements are elevators that transport the &quot;scholar[s] anxious to escape the noise and turmoil of the vulgar press [into]… a dream palace enshrining in its holy mysteries the power of the word.&quot;

Comprising fourteen storeys, plus two underground floors, the brutalist and futurist structure features raised podia and a suspended fourth floor. A mezzanine level physically connects Robarts Library to the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library building at its southeastern side, and to the Claude T. Bissell Building, housing the Faculty of Information, at its northeastern side. The concrete waffle slab floor plates are adorned with triangular-patterned tessellation. A hexagonal central circulation atrium is enclosed at the core of the building and through the middle of the mezzanine level. The gross area of the building is over .
In 2008, the university announced that Robarts Library would be receiving a significant upgrade, the first phase of which was completed in the spring of 2011. During these years a major transformation gradually took place at Robarts, beginning with the renovation of the apexes on each stack floor in 2008 (finished in 2010), the Map &amp; Data Library on the 5th floor in 2009, the Media Commons on the 3rd floor in 2010, and the second floor porticos in 2011. The renovations were intended to create a welcoming environment that would both provide informal study space and function to let people know about the services and resources available throughout the building. Signage throughout the building was redesigned and refreshed to improve navigation and usability of the library and its resources, and new touch screens are already improving communication with students, providing information such as the number of available workstations on each floor at any given time. Robarts outdoor signage can be scanned with the smartphone app Layar for augmented reality links.

=== Robarts Common ===

The next phase of the renewal was the addition of a five-storey pavilion which would become a new face of Robarts, opening up the west side of the building to the street, bringing a flood of natural light to the lower floors and making the overall environment more inviting, accessible and productive for students. The new pavilion opened as Robarts Common in September 2022, adding 1,200 new work and study spaces to Robarts, and bringing the library&#x27;s total number of study spaces to over 6,000. The renovations were designed by Diamond and Schmitt Architects Incorporated.

==Features and collections==

A 1974 article in the &quot;Canadian Architect&quot; magazine outlines the library&#x27;s significance to serving a campus community the size of a town, as well as by being a central storage for humankind&#x27;s recorded thoughts and inspiration. The library was initially intended for use by graduate students only, but following a student protest that included an illegal occupation of the building, undergraduate students were also granted access. The library&#x27;s initial design was for a mechanical book conveyor belt system to allow for faster collection by library staff, who would then send books downstairs for pickup. After Robarts was opened to all students, the conveyor system was discarded, although the tracks used by the conveyor system are still visible above the shelves. The library is open only to current students, faculty, and staff, external researchers, associate members, and alumni with paid privileges, as well as members of the University of Toronto School community. It is closed to members of the public.

The building houses a number of special collections, including the Mu Collection (Chinese: 慕氏藏書) which is a set of rare books from China in the Cheng Yu Tung East Asian Library, the largest research collection for Hong Kong and Canada-Hong Kong studies outside of Hong Kong at the Richard Charles Lee Canada-Hong Kong Library, and a sizable collection in Russian, Polish, Czech and Slovak, Ukrainian, and other East European languages at the Petro Jacyk Central &amp; East European Resource Centre.

In addition to an extensive collection of texts, the library provides limited after-hours study space to students during the academic year with the exception of weekends. The book stacks are off-limits after hours. In August 2010, the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre moved from the first floor of Robarts Library to OCAD University, which is shared with students with disabilities from that college, as well as from nearby Toronto Metropolitan University and Seneca College. 

==In popular culture==
Robarts Library may have served as a model for the secret library in Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. Eco spent much of the time writing the novel at the University of Toronto, and the stairwell of the secret library bears a particularly strong resemblance to that in Robarts Library.

Robarts was used for exterior shots of the prison setting in &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot;. The entire building is visible numerous times, having been digitally edited and transplanted from its downtown Toronto location to Los Angeles. In the film, it has been surrounded by a prison wall and hundreds of thousands of zombies. While the exterior retains its triangular shape, the interior is rectangular.

<text>The governor of Oregon is the head of government of the U.S. state of Oregon.

==List of governors==
The Oregon Country was obtained by the United States on January 30, 1819, as a shared region with the United Kingdom. The Oregon Treaty ended the sharing and formally established the borders on June 15, 1846.

The Champoeg Meetings, including a constitutional committee, held from February 1841 until May 1843, served as a &quot;de facto&quot; government before the government was officially established. While early attempts at establishing a government had been unsuccessful because of discontent between English American and French Canadian settlers over the question of whom they should choose as governor, several other officers were elected at these meetings, including Ira Babcock as Supreme Judge. For lack of a government, the Supreme Judge also received executive and legislative duties.

The meetings at Champoeg led up to the first constitution of the Oregon Country and several petitions for U.S. territorial status. The resulting acts created a provisional government on July 5, 1843. The first leaders of this government were an elected three-person Executive Committee. Later, George Abernethy was elected governor, and served from June 3, 1845, to March 3, 1849, though this government was never recognized by the federal government.

===Oregon Territory===

The region was organized as Oregon Territory on August 14, 1848. During its history it had five governors appointed by the president of the United States.

===State of Oregon===
The state of Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14, 1859.

The 1857 Constitution of Oregon provided for the election of a governor every four years, to serve no more than eight out of any twelve years. This length and limit have never been changed. It is one of the few states without a lieutenant governor. The office would devolve upon the secretary of state upon vacancy until a 1920 amendment put the president of the Senate first in the line of succession, and a 1972 amendment returned the secretary of state to the front.

<doc id="251833" wikidata="Q3551675" url="?curid=251833" title="University of St. Michael's College">
<text>The University of St. Michael&#x27;s College (officially called St. Michael&#x27;s College by the University of Toronto) is a federated college of the University of Toronto. It was founded in 1852 by the Congregation of St. Basil and retains its Catholic affiliation through its postgraduate theology faculty. However, it is primarily an undergraduate college for liberal arts and sciences.

St. Michael&#x27;s is most closely associated with teaching and research in the humanities and in theology. It is also known for being home to Marshall McLuhan throughout his influential career as a philosopher and communication theorist, from 1946 until his death in 1980. Both the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies and Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Institute of Eastern Christian Studies reside within the college. St. Michael&#x27;s College School is an affiliated boys school which was once the high school section of the college.

==History==
St. Michael&#x27;s College was founded in 1852 as a Basilian college by Fr. Jean-Mathieu Soulerin and other members of the Congregation of St. Basil originally of Annonay, France. The following year, it merged with St. Mary&#x27;s Lesser Seminary under the unified control of the Basilian Fathers, whose establishment in Canada began with Bishop Armand-François-Marie de Charbonnel. St. Michael&#x27;s College educated pupils at three levels, operating as a preparatory school, as a liberal arts college, and as a minor seminary. The Basilians received a large estate in 1853 from John Elmsley, son of the Chief Justice of Upper Canada and a prominent philanthropist. St. Michael&#x27;s College relocated to the new site east of the University of Toronto, and established the college parish, St. Basil&#x27;s Church. The incorporation of the college was granted Royal Assent in 1855.
In the late 19th century when universities were closed to new Irish immigrants and many Canadians of Irish descent, St Michael&#x27;s was seen as the only viable option and thus the school became a traditionally Irish filled college. Ever since this time St Michael&#x27;s has been a bastion for higher education and a beacon for the Irish-Canadian community in Toronto and southern Ontario, with others coming from all over the rest of Canada to attend the dominantly Irish school.

By withdrawing its financial support in 1868, the provincial government encouraged denominational colleges to seek closer relations with secular institutions. St. Michael&#x27;s affiliated with the University of Toronto in 1883, having secured a guarantee that it would conduct its own teaching in philosophy and history. The university senate authorized St. Michael&#x27;s to administer its own examinations in philosophy. On December 8, 1910, St. Michael&#x27;s College became a federated college of the University of Toronto. The college maintained autonomy in faculty hiring and teaching in liberal arts subjects, while the University of Toronto governed examinations and the granting of degrees in all subjects except theology. In 1912, Sir Robert Falconer, president of the University of Toronto, recognized the wish of St. Joseph&#x27;s College and Loretto College to affiliate with the university. St. Joseph&#x27;s and Loretto both became colleges of St. Michael&#x27;s College, thereby allowing their female students to receive University of Toronto degrees.
As the 20th century began, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. With the opening of the Institute of Mediaeval Studies in 1929, St Michael&#x27;s expanded further into graduate teaching and research. Ten years later, Pope Pius XII signed a papal charter creating the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies.

The preparatory school division of the college was reorganized in 1950 as St. Michael&#x27;s College School, an independent private school, ending the college&#x27;s direct governance while maintaining its affiliation. In 1952, the last lectures for women were held at Loretto and St. Joseph&#x27;s Colleges, which became residential units of the college. Thereafter, all teaching was conducted coeducationally in the classrooms of St. Michael&#x27;s College.
Throughout much of its history, St. Michael&#x27;s benefited from a common practice whereby staff and faculty who were members of religious orders would donate their salaries back to the college. This source of income gradually disappeared as new faculty members were hired with mainly secular backgrounds, compelling the college to seek new revenue. The college&#x27;s first modern fundraising attempt was launched in 1927, but was only partly successful due to the onset of the Great Depression. The Basilian Fathers of St. Michael&#x27;s College was registered as a charitable organization in 1972. Subsequent campaigns and land sales allowed the college to gradually increase its endowment, expand its academic programs and construct new residence buildings. The Canadian Catholic Bioethics Institute became affiliated with St. Michael&#x27;s College in 2001. In 2002, the college marked the sesquicentennial of its founding with an anniversary mass held in St. Basil&#x27;s Church.

==Campus and buildings==

The oldest buildings of St. Michael&#x27;s College were constructed on the original Clover Hill estate donated by John Elmsley, and were designed by noted Scottish architect William Hay. With subsequent land acquisitions in 1890, 1920, 1926 and 1928, the college expanded from Clover Hill westward to reach Queen&#x27;s Park. The present grounds of St. Michael&#x27;s College form the eastern end of the University of Toronto campus, with Victoria College to the north and Regis College to the south. The main quadrangle of St. Michael&#x27;s College is in the northwestern section of the college grounds, with its northern side leading into Victoria College.

 The cornerstone was laid at Clover Hill on September 16, 1855, for the college building and the college parish of St. Basil&#x27;s Church, which was consecrated November 16, 1856 with a Pontifical High Mass. This building is the oldest building at the University of Toronto in continuous academic use. A further addition, designed by William Irving, was constructed between 1872 and 1873 to house an auditorium, classrooms and student residence. In 1996, the original building was completely renovated by Carlos Ott Partnership Architects and renamed Odette Hall, and a modern religious art gallery donated by Fr. Daniel Donovan was installed on the two lower floors.
The master plan and Collegiate Gothic complex of buildings at the western side of the college nearest to Queen&#x27;s Park were built in 1935 and designed by architect Arthur William Holmes in Gothic revival style: the Pontifical Institute, More House, Fisher House, Brennan Hall (1938) and Teefy Hall (1935–1936) and extension of the East Wing, (1902–1903). Brennan Hall in the north-central section of campus contains a dining hall, faculty dining room, common rooms, and guestrooms. The small park between Brennan Hall and St. Basil&#x27;s Church is known as Scollard Park, named for St Michael&#x27;s alumnus Fr. Robert Scollard.

Fisher House and More House both began as residences for men, while classrooms and faculty offices were located in Teefy Hall to the south. The Queen&#x27;s Park Building to the north was built for the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. A student-faculty centre was built in 1968 as an extension of Brennan Hall.

The Soldier&#x27;s Memorial Slype connects the college quadrangle with Queen&#x27;s Park, its sandstone walls etched with the names of St. Michael&#x27;s College alumni who died in the World Wars and the Korean War.

Examples of early post-war architecture at the college include Carr Hall, designed by Ernest Cormier and built in 1954, housing faculty and administrative offices, classrooms and an auditorium. At the northern edge of campus, Elmsley Hall was built in 1955 as a men&#x27;s residence and a new residence for the Loretto College was built in 1958. The brutalist concrete building of the John M. Kelly Library was opened in 1969, at the southern portion of the college on St. Joseph Street. The former Ontario Research Council building next to the library has been redesigned with classrooms and offices as the Muzzo Family Alumni Hall.
A private tree-lined street, named Elmsley Place, runs up the center of the college&#x27;s campus, connecting St Joseph Street to Brennan Hall. This street, laid out around the turn of the 20th century, is flanked by a group of five beautiful brick Victorian mansions that constituted Toronto&#x27;s first subdivision. On the west side of Elmsley Place, heading south to north, stands McCorkell and Sullivan House (also known as Houses 2 and 96), and Gilson and Maritain House (also known as Houses 6 and 8). Both are student residences. On the east side of Elmsley Place, heading south to north, are Founders House, Phelan House, and Windle House. Founders House, at one point a student residence known as Bellisle House, is currently home to the office of the college&#x27;s president, as well as other administrative offices. Phalen House serves as the rectory for the Basilian priests who oversee neighboring St. Basil&#x27;s parish. Windle House, at the northeast corner of the street, is home to the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Institute of Eastern Christian Studies.

In addition to St. Basil&#x27;s, the college is home to several other sacred spaces. A small Roman Catholic chapel is located on the first floor of Elmsley Hall and is open to residents. The Ukrainian Catholic Chapel of St. Sophia, which is operated as part of the Sheptytsky Institute, is located on the lower floor of Elmsley Hall and offers daily services in the Byzantine Rite. A chapel dedicated to the Coptic tradition is located on the upper floor of Windle House. The Dante Garden sculpture park is also located on the southwest corner of the campus.

==Academics==
The University of St. Michael&#x27;s College comprises the Regis St. Michael&#x27;s Faculty of Theology, a Division of Continuing Education, and its namesake undergraduate division, St Michael&#x27;s College. Within the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science, St. Michael&#x27;s College sponsors the academic programs of book and media studies, Celtic studies, Christianity and Culture, Mediaeval studies and the Concurrent Teacher Religious Education Program. In 1996, the French and German departments of the University of Toronto took up residence on the St Michael&#x27;s campus, followed in 2000 by the departments of Italian and Slavic studies.

After a reorganization in 1954, degrees in theology have been through the Faculty of Theology of St. Michael&#x27;s College. In 1969, the Faculty of Theology became one of the founding colleges of the Toronto School of Theology, an ecumenical federation of the theological colleges at the University of Toronto. The undergraduate division of St. Michael&#x27;s College joined the undergraduate divisions of six other University of Toronto colleges in 1974 to reorganize its academic departments into the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Science. In 2005, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies ceased to be a division of the University of St. Michael&#x27;s College and was reconstituted as an affiliated institution of U.S.M.C. instead.


Marshall McLuhan was hired as a member of faculty at St. Michael&#x27;s College in 1946, and taught English literature at the college until his death in 1980. During this time he became famous and influential for his books &quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; (1951), &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; (1962), and &quot;Understanding Media&quot; (1964), in addition to his oft-quoted aphorisms on communications and media such as &quot;the medium is the message&quot;.

The John M. Kelly Library is the main library at St. Michael&#x27;s College, and is part of the University of Toronto&#x27;s mass digitization partnership with the Internet Archive. Although the library building was opened in 1969, the library collection dates back to the earliest days of the college. The collection has since been developed in support of undergraduate programmes in the Faculty of Arts and Science, graduate programmes in the Faculty of Theology, and programmes of the college&#x27;s continuing education division. In addition to more than 300,000 bookform volumes, the library maintains subscriptions to almost 500 journals and magazines and has the largest suite of public computers on the east side of the University of Toronto campus.

The Kelly Library&#x27;s collection has representation mainly in the areas of humanities and social sciences, particularly in book history, media studies, philosophy, Celtic history, languages and literature, Canadian history, English literature, and Medieval history. The theological collection emphasizes patristics, early and medieval church history, Thomism, the Bible (especially Canon, Johannine literature, and the history of criticism), liturgical renewal, religious education, and Catholic missions. There are also extensive archival special collections including substantial holdings of G. K. Chesterton, John Henry Newman, early printed books, and the papers of Henri Nouwen and Sheila Watson.

==College governance==

Since St Michael&#x27;s College&#x27;s founding in 1852, the school has retained a strong connection to its Roman Catholic roots, in particular, with the Congregation of St. Basil. The college is primarily governed by three offices- the Chancellor, the President, and the Principal. The Chancellor serves as the ceremonial head of the college, and since the days of the college&#x27;s founding, the office has been occupied by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Toronto. Prior to 1954, the office of the President was referred to as the Superior, and was always occupied by one of the Basilian priests from the adjacent St Basil&#x27;s parish. The position morphed into the current Presidential role once St Michael&#x27;s federated into the University of Toronto and re-organized in the 1950s, although several Basilians still held the office following. Today the President heads the administration of the college, and represents its interests in relation to the rest of the university and beyond. Founded in 1976, the office of the Principal heads the college&#x27;s academics, and retains relations with all the various faculties and departments associated with and located at the college.

==Residences and student life==


Within the secular environment of the University of Toronto, the Catholic traditions of St. Michael&#x27;s are still evident in its college programs, fellows&#x27; interests, and student activities. Thus far, the college has largely avoided stirring controversy in its move toward coeducational residences.
Unlike the university&#x27;s other colleges, where most residences are co-ed, the majority of St Michael&#x27;s residents reside on single sex floors. However, there are two co-ed residences currently at the college (Historic House 2&amp;96 and Upper Brennan). Female students also have the option to live at the single-sex Loretto College residence; although males are permitted to visit during designated guest hours.

The dons at St. Michael&#x27;s College are graduate, senior undergraduate and professional faculty students. The college&#x27;s dining hall, the Canada Room, has recently been expanded and renovated and its hours have been extended.

<text>Robert Keith Rae (born August 2, 1948) is a Canadian diplomat and former politician who is the current Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations since 2020. He previously served as the 21st premier of Ontario from 1990 to 1995, leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party from 1982 to 1996, and interim leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2011 to 2013. Between 1978 and 2013, he was elected 11 times to federal (Broadview, Broadview-Greenwood, Toronto Centre) and provincial (York South) parliaments.

Rae was a New Democratic Party (NDP) Member of Parliament from 1978 to 1982. He then moved to provincial politics, serving as leader of the Ontario NDP from February 7, 1982, to June 22, 1996. After leading his party to victory in the 1990 provincial election he served as the 21st Premier of Ontario from October 1, 1990, to June 26, 1995, and was the first person to have led a provincial NDP government east of Manitoba. While in office, he brought forward a number of initiatives that were unpopular with many traditional NDP supporters, such as the Social Contract. Rae&#x27;s subsequent disagreement with the leftward direction of the NDP led him to resign his membership. In 2006, he joined the Liberals; he had previously been a Liberal in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 2006, Rae was a candidate for the leadership of the Liberals, finishing in third place on the third ballot. He returned to the House of Commons of Canada on March 31, 2008, as a Liberal MP after winning a March 17, 2008 by-election, holding the riding that had previously been held by Liberal Bill Graham. He was re-elected in the 2008 general election. Rae ran again as a candidate for the party leadership but withdrew on December 12, 2008. He was re-elected in the Toronto Centre riding in the 2011 general election and was named interim leader of the Liberal Party weeks later, replacing Michael Ignatieff; he served in that position until Justin Trudeau&#x27;s election as party leader in early 2013.

On June 19, 2013, Rae announced that he would resign from parliament in order to become chief negotiator for James Bay area First Nations in their negotiations with the provincial government. His resignation from parliament became effective July 31, 2013. Rae joined Olthuis Kleer Townshend LLP, a law firm specializing in representing Aboriginal clients, as a partner in February 2014. Rae sits as an advisor to Canada&#x27;s Ecofiscal Commission. Rae was appointed Canada&#x27;s special envoy to Myanmar in October 2017 and advised Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the Rohingya crisis. He is also a Senior Fellow to the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and a Distinguished Fellow at the Munk School at the University of Toronto. On July 6, 2020, his appointment as Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

== Family ==
Rae was born in Ottawa, Ontario. His parents were Lois Esther (George) and Saul Rae, an eminent Canadian career diplomat who had postings in Washington, Geneva, New York, Mexico, and The Hague. Rae&#x27;s paternal grandparents immigrated from Scotland, and his mother had English ancestry. Rae was raised as an Anglican. As an adult, he found out that his paternal grandfather was Jewish and was from a family of Lithuanian immigrants to Scotland.

Rae&#x27;s elder brother John A. Rae (born 1945) was an executive vice-president and director of Power Corporation and a prominent member of the Liberal Party. He was also an adviser to Jean Chrétien when he was Indian Affairs Minister in 1968, and then again from 1993 until 2003 while Chrétien was prime minister. Rae&#x27;s younger brother, David, was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in 1987. Despite a bone marrow transplant from his brother, he died of leukemia in 1989 at age 32.

Rae learned of his family&#x27;s Jewish origins in 1968. The revelation had a strong impact on him: he sought to explore his Jewish culture, dated Jewish girls exclusively and ultimately married a Jewish woman. Upon his marriage to Arlene Perly Rae, Rae agreed to raise their three daughters in his wife&#x27;s Jewish faith. Rae is a member of Holy Blossom Temple, a Reform Jewish congregation in Toronto.

His uncle, the late Jackie Rae, was an entertainer and former host of &quot;The Jackie Rae Show&quot; on CBC and also performed on British television.

== Early career ==
Rae attended Crichton Street Public School in Ottawa, Horace Mann Public School and Gordon Junior High School in Washington, D.C. (1956–1961), and the International School of Geneva, Switzerland. His first job was a paper route delivering the Washington&#x27;s &quot;Evening Star&quot; newspaper, which he later described as &quot;one of the worst newspapers in the history of modern journalism&quot;. His customers included Richard Nixon and Estes Kefauver. Rae later joked that Kefauver gave him a $20 tip one Christmas, whereas Pat Nixon only gave him a quarter and made him more sympathetic to Democrats from that moment.

Rae graduated with honours from University College, University of Toronto, where he also later received his law degree. Michael Ignatieff, who later became Rae&#x27;s rival for the Liberal Party leadership, was his roommate for a time. He first became involved in politics by volunteering on Trudeau&#x27;s 1968 Liberal leadership campaign, and later worked on Liberal Charles Caccia&#x27;s campaign in the 1968 federal election. Rae and Caccia have remained personal friends through their political careers. During his final year as an undergraduate, Rae was a student representative on the Bissell Commission on University Government.

As a result of his strong student record, Rae was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he studied at Balliol College, Oxford under Isaiah Berlin. His Bachelor of Philosophy thesis criticized the cultural imperialism of early Fabian socialists in the United Kingdom, such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb. During his period in Britain he became involved with social work, helping squatters find rental accommodation in London. He attributes the experience with helping him develop a deepened commitment to social justice and, on his return to Canada in 1974 Rae joined the social democratic NDP. He worked in labour law during the mid-1970s.

== Federal New Democrat MP ==

Rae was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1978 by-election, defeating Progressive Conservative Tom Clifford by 420 votes in the Toronto riding of Broadview. Rae won the NDP nomination over former MP John Paul Harney and activist Kay Macpherson.

He won a full term in the 1979 federal election from the renamed riding of Broadview—Greenwood, and gained national prominence as the NDP&#x27;s finance critic. In December 1979 he proposed a subamendment to the budget motion, stating that the House of Commons did not approve of Clark&#x27;s budget. It was this motion&#x27;s passage that toppled Clark&#x27;s government after only eight months.

Rae was elected to parliament for a third time in the 1980 federal election, and married Arlene Perly days later. In caucus, he sided with party leader Ed Broadbent in supporting patriation of the Canadian Constitution with a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He also articulated his party&#x27;s policy on the Canadian Bank Act, and criticized the Bank of Canada&#x27;s high interest rate policy.

== Ontario NDP leader ==
During the same period Rae was in Ottawa, the Ontario New Democratic Party was suffering from internal disunity under the leadership of Michael Cassidy. Cassidy resigned as leader after a poor performance in the 1981 provincial election, and a movement began to draft Rae as his replacement. Rae initially declined a request from a provincial delegation led by Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Dave Cooke, but reconsidered after further entreaties from former Ontario NDP leader Stephen Lewis and many others.

Eleven of the party&#x27;s 21 MPPs endorsed his candidacy, as did much of the labour movement. Rae&#x27;s supporters in caucus were Marion Bryden, Brian Charlton, Dave Cooke, Odoardo Di Santo, Tony Grande, Donald C. MacDonald, Robert Mackenzie, Elie Martel, Ed Philip, George Samis and Mel Swart. He was the most centrist candidate in the contest, and easily defeated Richard Johnston and Jim Foulds at a leadership convention in early 1982.

When Rae won the NDP leadership, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party had governed Ontario since 1943 and was widely regarded as unbeatable. Rae was strongly critical of the Bill Davis government&#x27;s approach to social issues, and used his acceptance speech to describe the PC Party&#x27;s Ontario as &quot;Toryland&quot;, &quot;essentially a country club in which women and people of colour were not welcome&quot;. His comments were criticized by some in the media, though Rae himself would later write that his words seemed &quot;particularly apt&quot; in retrospect and &quot;certainly aroused an angry response which often means a target has been hit&quot;.

=== First session ===

After Rae won the party leadership, there was a delay of several months before he was able to contest a by-election to enter the Ontario legislature. Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) Jim Renwick, Marion Bryden and Tony Grande all declined to relinquish their seats, before former party leader Donald C. MacDonald agreed to stand down in the York South constituency. Rae defeated Liberal candidate John Nunziata, a York councillor in a by-election on November 4, 1982. Counting the leadership contest, this was his fifth election in just over four years.

The opposition Liberals were led by the inexperienced David Peterson. Many senior NDP strategists believed their party could surpass the Liberals for second place, and Rae and Peterson became frequent rivals for media attention and public support between 1982 and 1985. The NDP took two seats from the Liberals in late 1984 by-elections, and polling by Decima Research from this period put them slightly ahead of the Liberals, although still well behind the PCs.

=== 1985 election and the Liberal–NDP accord ===

The NDP did not make the anticipated gains in the 1985 provincial election held on May 2, 1985. They won 25 seats out of 125, only a modest improvement from their 1981 showing. The Progressive Conservatives lost support after Davis retired and right-wing candidate Frank Miller was chosen as their new leader. However, it was the Liberals rather than the NDP who were able to reposition themselves in the political centre and reap the benefits of this change.

Rae nonetheless played a pivotal role in bringing the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s 42-year dynasty to an end. The 1985 election resulted in a minority parliament, in which the Tories held four more seats than David Peterson&#x27;s Liberals, but were eleven seats short of a majority. Rae entered into negotiations with both Premier Miller and Peterson, the latter begun by a phone call from Rae to Peterson shortly after election day. Rae and Peterson signed a &quot;Liberal-NDP Accord&quot; in which the NDP agreed to support a Liberal government in office for two years. The Liberals, in turn, agreed to implement some policies favoured by the NDP. Rae had personally supported a full coalition, but did not strongly argue this case with other members of his party. Peterson later indicated that he would not have accepted a coalition in any event.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in a no-confidence motion on June 18, 1985, and Lieutenant-Governor John Black Aird asked Peterson to form a new government. Rae himself moved the motion of non-confidence, as he had done in the defeat of Joe Clark&#x27;s government six years earlier. With support from Rae, Peterson&#x27;s minority government implemented socially progressive legislation on matters such as pay equity, brought an end to extra-billing by doctors, and established campaign spending limits. Rae often criticized Peterson&#x27;s approach to specific issues, but never moved to bring down the government.

Rae advocated pension reform in early 1986, following revelations that some corporate leaders in Ontario had been given permission to withdraw money from their employees&#x27; pension funds. He was especially critical of Conrad Black, who then held a controlling interest in Dominion Stores Ltd., for withdrawing $62 million at a time when many laid off company workers were unable to receive severance pay. During a legislative debate, Rae described Black as &quot;that most symbolic representative of bloated capitalism at its worst&quot;. The Liberal government declined to act on the matter. Later in the same year, Rae argued that the Peterson government should reform the Ontario Human Rights Code to include provisions for group defamation and systematic discrimination.

Some members of the NDP disapproved of the party&#x27;s accord with the Liberals. Party activist Ian Orenstein challenged Rae for the provincial leadership in 1986 in a symbolic protest against the party&#x27;s centrist tilt. Rae won without difficulty.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===

Peterson&#x27;s minority government was very popular during its two years in office, and the Liberal Party won a landslide majority government in the 1987 provincial election, called after the conclusion of the Liberal-NDP accord. The NDP was reduced to nineteen seats and Rae was nearly defeated in his own riding, defeating high-profile Liberal challenger Alan Tonks by only 333 votes. The Progressive Conservatives under Larry Grossman suffered an even more serious defeat, falling to only sixteen seats. As a result, Rae became Leader of the Opposition once the legislature resumed.

In September 1989, Rae took part in a highly publicized protest in support of native land claims in the middle of the Temagami Forest in Northern Ontario. Following discussions with Chief Gary Potts, Rae agreed to participate in a road sit-in to protect a strand of old pine, a key aspect of the native claim. After the protest, Rae was escorted to a police wagon by members of the Ontario Provincial Police and driven to the nearby town of Elk Lake. He was not charged with an offense.

There was considerable speculation that Rae would seek the federal NDP leadership in 1989, after the resignation of Ed Broadbent. High-profile party members such as former Ontario NDP leader Stephen Lewis, Allan Blakeney and Roy Romanow of Saskatchewan, Gary Doer of Manitoba and Alexa McDonough of Nova Scotia all encouraged him to run, as did several representatives of organized labour. Expecting Rae to resign, Bud Wildman, Ruth Grier and Richard Johnston began preparing campaigns to succeed him as leader of the Ontario NDP. On October 5, 1989, however, Rae announced that he would not return to federal politics and would remain as provincial leader. Several of Rae&#x27;s associates, including Arlene Perly Rae, declared their support for Howard McCurdy, and later moved to Audrey McLaughlin after McCurdy was dropped from the ballot at the leadership convention. Rae declined to endorse a candidate.

Rae was an international observer for Lithuania&#x27;s first multi-party elections in early 1990. A lifelong opponent of communism, he later wrote that he was impressed by the spirit of the opposition Sąjūdis party, which won the election. He was also very critical of the Kremlin&#x27;s harsh response to the opposition&#x27;s victory.

=== Election victory ===

Peterson called a snap election for 1990. The NDP entered the campaign with low expectations, as the Liberals still held a significant lead in opinion polls and all signs indicated that they would win another majority government. Rae later acknowledged that he did not expect to win the election, and planned to leave electoral politics at some point in the next sitting of the legislature. A number of prominent MPPs, including Richard Johnston, Marion Bryden and David Reville, chose not to seek re-election. Floyd Laughren was also planning to retire, but had not finalized his plans when Peterson dropped the writ.

Contrary to expectations, the Liberal Party&#x27;s support base declined significantly in mid-campaign. The snap election was unpopular, and the Liberals suffered lingering effects from an earlier scandal involving Liberal fundraiser Patti Starr undermined public confidence in the government. Peterson&#x27;s prominent role in drafting and supporting the troubled Meech Lake Accord for constitutional reform proved a particular liability. There were also signs of an economic downturn by this time and some believed that Peterson had called the snap election to avoid its full impact. The Progressive Conservatives were led by the inexperienced Mike Harris, who ran a narrow campaign focused on tax issues and was unable to capitalize on the Liberal slide. As such, Rae&#x27;s NDP was the primary beneficiary. Rae himself was more confident than in the 1985 and 1987 campaigns, and took a more aggressive stance against the Peterson government. A poll taken late in the campaign showed the NDP holding a slight lead over the Liberals.

The election results were nonetheless a surprise to political observers across the province, even to longtime NDP supporters. The NDP was elected to a strong majority government with 74 seats. The popular vote was very close, with the NDP outpolling the Liberals 37% to 34%. Several ridings were won by narrow margins. However, the NDP managed to take many seats from the Liberals in the Greater Toronto Area, and also did better than ever before (or in some cases, since) in many other cities and rural areas. Due to the nature of the first-past-the-post electoral system, which ignores the popular vote and only awards power based on the number of ridings won, this decimated the Liberal caucus. The Liberals lost 59 seats, the worst defeat in their history and the second-worst defeat for a governing party in Ontario. The NDP even managed to unseat Peterson in his own riding.

== Premier ==
On October 1, 1990, Rae was sworn in as the first, and to date the only, NDP Premier of Ontario. He also took the Intergovernmental Affairs portfolio, giving himself a direct voice in future constitutional negotiations.

Bob Rae was in power for 1650 days, the longest term for an Ontario premier since the Second World War. He became one of the few Ontario premiers who could speak French.

He was very popular for his first six months as Premier, with a poll from March 1991 showing the NDP at 52% support. The federal NDP also received 56% support in Ontario in a January 1991 poll.

The government was unable to sustain its popularity, however, and by late 1992 had fallen to third place in public opinion polls. The party&#x27;s popularity continued to ebb throughout 1993, followed by only a modest recovery in the next two years. This, among other factors, partially contributed to a significant decline in support for the federal NDP.

There are many reasons for the Rae government&#x27;s loss of popularity between 1991 and 1993. The NDP had never governed Ontario before, and Ontario was experiencing its worst recession since the Great Depression. The government backtracked on several campaign promises, most notably the introduction of public auto insurance, which caused disagreements among the party and supporters, especially from members of the progressive wing of the party such as cabinet ministers Howard Hampton and Shelley Martel. A number of scandals in cabinet and caucus due to the large number of rookie MPPs also cut into the government&#x27;s popularity.

In the 1993 federal election, the federal NDP fell to a historic low of 6% support in Ontario. All 10 New Democrat MPs from Ontario lost their seats to Liberal challengers as the Liberals won all but one seat in the province. Besides many NDP supporters nationwide voting Liberal to ensure that the Conservatives would be defeated (to avoid the vote-splitting of the 1988 election), the Rae government&#x27;s unpopularity was a major factor in the federal NDP&#x27;s losses. On the day after the election, defeated MP Steven Langdon called on Rae to resign. Langdon had openly campaigned against Rae&#x27;s austerity measures. Although he lost by 13,000 votes to the Liberal candidate, he received a higher percentage of votes than any other NDP candidate in the province.

Notwithstanding its setbacks, the Rae government achieved some positive accomplishments during its time in office. It saved many jobs in northern Ontario through its bailout of Algoma Steel, and negotiated a similar contract for paper mill workers in Kapuskasing. Other popular initiatives included the TTC Eglinton West subway line in Toronto (even though the official transit plan only recommended a busway for current needs), support for public housing, and the Jobs Ontario job creation program. Rae&#x27;s decision to approve casino gambling for the province was also opposed by many in the party but it provided a steady source of revenue.

=== Rae&#x27;s Government policies ===

==== Economic policy ====

Ontario&#x27;s economic forecast was bleak when Rae took office in October 1990. The Liberal government had forecast a small surplus earlier in the year, but a worsening North American economy led to a $700 million deficit before Rae took office. In October, the NDP projected a $2.5 billion deficit for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 1991. Some economists projected soaring deficits for the upcoming years, even if the Rae government implemented austerity measures. Rae himself was critical of the Bank of Canada&#x27;s high interest rate policy, arguing that it would lead to increased unemployment throughout the country. He also criticized the 1991 federal budget, arguing the Finance Minister Michael Wilson was shifting the federal debt to the provinces.

The Rae government&#x27;s first budget, introduced in 1991, increased social spending to mitigate the economic slowdown and projected a record deficit of $9.1 billion. Finance Minister Floyd Laughren argued that Ontario made a decision to target the effects of the recession rather than the deficit, and said that the budget would create or protect 70,000 jobs. It targeted more money to social assistance, social housing and child benefits, and raised taxes for high-income earners while lowering rates for 700,000 low-income Ontarians.

==== Labour policy ====

In April 1991, the government introduced a one-year program to protect the pay of workers whose firms had shut down due to the recession. Labour Minister Bob Mackenzie estimated that the plan would help 56,000 workers.

Rae claims he faced a true emergency in the spring of 1993 a crisis of government on which he had to act. Upon returning from Davos, Rae gave a speech on 9 February describing international business leaders&#x27; despair over government deficits and inefficiencies in Europe, where they stressed &quot;the worldwide trend to redesign organizations, downsizing wherever possible and trying to make their organizations more responsive&quot;. Rae left Davos convinced that major changes in Ontario public services were needed, where these changes were of the kind long-proposed by the more conservative and business leaders of Ontario.

As a result, his government brought in the &quot;Social Contract&quot;, austerity legislation which reopened collective bargaining agreements with the province&#x27;s public sector unions. This legislation imposed a wage freeze and introduced what became known as &quot;Rae days&quot;, requiring civil servants to take up to twelve days off without pay per year. These measures generated nearly 2 billion dollars in savings for Ontario, without laying off any public sector workers. These cutbacks led to a falling-out with both the public sector unions, most notably Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU), and the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) and its leader Buzz Hargrove. Sid Ryan, Ontario President of the Canadian Union of Public Employees stated that Rae&#x27;s passing of the &quot;Social Contract&quot; was unforgivable.

&quot;Macleans&quot; reported that Rae had been delivered &quot;a secret ultimatum&quot; &quot;by Canadian and international bond dealers&quot;. If he didn&#x27;t get the deficit under $10 billion, they would demand junk-bond interest rates in order to finance Ontario&#x27;s debt. Richard Walkom suggested it was a sudden panic of an NDP party aware of the stereotype it could not manage a budget, using the crisis as an opportunity to demonstrate it would use extreme measures in the appropriate circumstances. Regardless of whether Davos visit provided an epiphany, pressure or panic, this event is agreed as the beginning of the Ontario government&#x27;s concessions to international corporations.

Indeed, no less than a year later at Davos, Rae arrived as a pro-business head of government. He approached the World Economic Forum as a unabashed champion of the international corporation working against the expansion of workers&#x27; wages and government services. He proposed giving a large majority of Ontario&#x27;s investment planning to international banking and securities firms, meeting with Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Nomura Securities, all of whom sold Ontario bonds on the global market. Instead of selling more bonds, he was now asking them to &quot;sell Ontario through their global networks&quot;, looking to &quot;plug into&quot; them instead of spending government money to control publicly-controlled avenues to investment.

This breach between the NDP and the labour movement struck at the party&#x27;s foundations. The NDP was founded as an alliance between the old Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the labour movement, and Rae&#x27;s policy decisions alienated many traditional NDP voters. Thousands of members resigned from the party, and several unions turned against the NDP and vowed to defeat the government in the next election. The Rae government later attempted to regain labour support by passing Bill 40, a measure which (among other things) introduced anti-scab provisions to the province. This was not enough to bridge the gap with organized labour, however, and the party was unable to regain significant union support.

==== Health policy ====
As Premier, Rae placed a cap on enrollment into medical schools. The Rae government also delisted home care from OHIP coverage but introduced a new comprehensive program to deliver the service mostly on a non-profit basis by publicly run, regional multi-service agencies and passed the Home Care and Community Services Act, 1994 to facilitate this. The Harris government subsequently rejected this model for a brokerage model in which Community Care Access Centres would hire a home care provider to service a region rather than provide the service directly and lifted the 10% limit on the use of for-profit service delivery that the Rae government had imposed.

==== Auto insurance ====

The New Democratic Party campaigned on a promise to introduce public auto insurance in the 1987 and 1990 campaigns. After assuming office, Rae appointed Peter Kormos, one of the most vocal proponents of public insurance, as the minister responsible for bringing forward the policy. With the onset of the recession, however, both business and labour groups expressed concern about layoffs and lost revenues. The government backtracked from the policy in 1991. Kormos, who had already been dropped from cabinet, became Rae&#x27;s most vocal critic in the NDP caucus.

==== Social policy ====

Rae&#x27;s government attempted to introduce a variety of socially progressive measures during its time in office, though its success in this field was mixed. In 1994, the government introduced legislation, Bill 167, which would have provided for same-sex partnership benefits in the province. At the time, this legislation was seen as a revolutionary step forward for same-sex recognition. It was defeated, however, when twelve NDP MPPs (including two junior ministers) voted against it, while the opposition Liberals led by Lyn McLeod also withdrew their support.

The Rae government established an employment equity commission in 1991, and two years later introduced affirmative action to improve the numbers of women, non-whites, aboriginals and disabled persons working across the private and public sectors. This policy was controversial, and it cost the NDP support among its unionized working-class base of support.

In November 1990, the Rae government announced that it would restrict most rent increases to 4.6% for the present year and 5.4% for 1991. The provisions for 1990 were made retroactive. Tenants&#x27; groups supported these changes, while landlord representatives were generally opposed. Dave Cooke, the minister responsible for implementing the policy, later announced that he would work to factor in the costs of legitimate building renovations.

When campaigning in 1990, Rae promised that he would eliminate food banks through anti-poverty initiatives. After taking office, however, his government committed a significant sum of money to support Ontario&#x27;s existing food banks. Gerard Kennedy, leader of the Daily Bread Food Bank in Toronto, criticized Rae for not targeting the money toward affordable housing and welfare reforms. In April 1991, Community and Social Services minister Zanana Akande announced that food banks would have to remain open in light of changed economic circumstances.

Rae increased the basic social assistance allowance by 7% in 1991, and increased the maximum payment for shelter allowances by 10%.

Rae supports abortion rights, saying &quot;The rights of women to choose, to have control over their own bodies, is not a right which is going to be taken away by the Parliament of Canada, and it is not a right which should be subject to some private member&#x27;s bill which is going to affect the rights of women to have choice, to have genuine equality and to have full and complete access to the medicare and the health care that they need.&quot;

==== Aboriginal issues ====

Soon after assuming office in 1990, Rae announced his support for native Canadians&#x27; &quot;inherent right to self-government&quot;. He later worked to help six aboriginal bands in Northern Ontario gain reserve status, and called for self-government on the Akwesasne Indian Reserve, in part to help the reserve leaders combat smuggling. Rae also pushed for native rights to be included in future constitutional reforms.

==== Energy policy ====

In November 1990, the Rae government announced an indefinite moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants in Ontario. He consistently opposed plans to privatize Ontario Hydro.

==== Intergovernmental affairs and Quebec status ====

In March 1991, Rae announced that he would support a new round of constitutional negotiations between the federal government and the provinces, which ultimately proved to be unsuccessful. He indicated that Ontario was willing to recognize Quebec as a distinct society, and called for aboriginal and women&#x27;s rights to be entrenched in the Canadian Constitution. Rae also supported the creation of a &quot;social charter&quot;, to establish national standards for social programs such as medicare.

Early in his term, Rae indicated that his government would continue a long-standing development freeze in Toronto&#x27;s Harbourfront area, to ensure the survival of cultural programs in the area.

Rae was initially one of the most prominent opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement in Canada. During a meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1991, he argued that any proposed North American free trade zone would have to incorporate common environmental and labour standards.

==== Law enforcement ====

Rae endorsed Susan Eng&#x27;s successful bid to chair the Metro Toronto Police Services Board in early 1991, over the opposition of several police officers. Rae later introduced policies requiring Ontario police services to hire more women, disabled people, native Canadians and members of visible minority groups.

==== Sunday shopping ====

When Rae assumed office, the Retail Business Holidays Act of Ontario had recently been found unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court of Ontario, meaning that many stores were allowed to open legally on Sundays for the first time. Rae announced that his government planned to introduce legislation for a &quot;common pause day&quot; across Ontario, &quot;to help strengthen family and community life while protecting small business and the rights of workers&quot;. In practice, this initiative would have required many retail establishments to close on Sundays, with exemptions for religious minority communities. The province also appealed the court ruling to a higher court, the Ontario Court of Appeal, which restored the previous status quo.

However, many retail owners as well as members of the general public preferred Sunday shopping to be legal,
and in 1992 the Rae government yielded to the pressure and reversed its position, amending the Retail Business Holidays Act so that only statutory holidays, and not Sundays, would be common pause days.

==== Education – A Royal Commission ====
The Rae government created a Royal Commission on Learning – co-chaired by Gerald Caplan and Monique Bégin – which delivered its report and recommendations: &quot;For the Love of Learning&quot; in January 1995. Among the reports&#x27; more prominent recommendations were:
* the creation of a common curriculum for Ontario schools
* the equalization of funding per pupil
* the elimination of grade 13
* the appointment of pupil representatives on Ontario school boards
* the creation of a College of Teachers (recommendation #58)
* the implementation of uniform testing of students at various grade levels.

=== 1995 election ===

Rae&#x27;s popularity had recovered somewhat by 1995, but by the time the writs were dropped for that year&#x27;s provincial election it was obvious that the NDP would not be re-elected.

The official opposition Liberals were expected to be the primary benefactors of the NDP&#x27;s unpopularity, having recovered from their severe defeat of five years earlier, and leading in opinion polls since 1992. However, several unpopular policy reversals and mistakes by Liberal leader Lyn McLeod allowed Mike Harris and the Tories to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP. During the leaders&#x27; debates, while Rae and McLeod traded barbs, Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera about the PC&#x27;s platform. Several working-class ridings which had long voted NDP became disgruntled with the party due to the Social Contract and affirmative action, so they were attracted by Harris&#x27; populism and shifted to the Tories. While the NDP polled considerably better in northern Ontario than it did in 1990, it lost much of its support in rest of the province, especially the 905 region where they had won many seats five years earlier. In the end the Tories shot from third place to a landslide majority government, sweeping the NDP from power. The Liberals lost six seats, but retained their status as the official opposition, while the NDP fell to only seventeen seats and third place in the Legislative Assembly.

Rae himself was reelected in his own riding by over 3,000 votes. However, on February 29, 1996; he resigned as NDP leader and MPP for York South and moved to positions in law, academia and the private sector. He joined the law firm of Goodmans LLP. He was eventually succeeded as party leader by Howard Hampton, who was formerly Natural Resources Minister in Rae&#x27;s cabinet and a longtime left-wing rival. Liberal Gerard Kennedy succeeded Rae as MPP for York South.

== After NDP ==

Rae resigned from the New Democratic Party in 1998 due to his appointment to the Security Intelligence Review Committee. There was some speculation that Prime Minister Jean Chrétien would have him appointed Governor General in 1999, but he was passed over in favour of Adrienne Clarkson. There was further speculation that Rae would return to the federal Liberals and run under their banner in the 2000 election, though nothing came of this at the time.

Rae was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2000, and in 2004 he was appointed to the Order of Ontario. He was appointed the sixth chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University on July 2, 2003, and was installed at that school&#x27;s fall convocation in October. Rae also became a partner at Goodmans LLP, a Toronto-based corporate law firm, an adjunct professor at the University of Toronto, and a Senior Fellow of Massey College. He has written a number of books: &quot;From Protest to Power: Personal Reflections on a Life in Politics&quot; (1996), &quot;Three Questions: Prosperity and the Public Good&quot; (1998), &quot;Canada in the Balance&quot; (2006), &quot;Exporting Democracy: The Risks and Rewards of Pursuing a Good Idea&quot; (2010), and &quot;What&#x27;s Happened to Politics?&quot; (2016). He was the national spokesperson for the Leukemia Research Foundation.

Rae helped the Toronto Symphony Orchestra restructure following an extended strike by its musicians at the beginning of the 1999–2000 season.

Rae returned to active politics on April 16, 2002, two days after Mike Harris announced his resignation as premier, with an opinion piece in the &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper. In an article entitled, &quot;Parting Company with the NDP&quot;, Rae strongly criticized what he perceived as a bias against Israel in the federal party, and also criticized the NDP for rejecting Tony Blair&#x27;s Third Way concept and for refusing to accept globalization and open markets. He suggested that the party&#x27;s economic policies were insufficient for the 21st century, and that the party as a whole was no longer &quot;worthy of support&quot;.

The Ontario NDP distanced itself from Rae&#x27;s policies under Hampton. During the 2003 provincial election, Hampton argued that Rae was wrong to reverse the NDP&#x27;s commitment to public auto insurance. The party&#x27;s relations with the labour movement have not completely healed, although the situation has improved since 1993. Relations with the CAW remain especially fraught, and memories of the social contract have hurt the NDP&#x27;s credibility with a new generation of public sector workers, despite the party&#x27;s efforts to distance itself from the measure. Nonetheless, the Ontario NDP remained in third place in the Legislative Assembly, and would not win more than 20 seats in the legislature until 2014 under Hampton&#x27;s successor, Andrea Horwath. It would not come out of the political wilderness until 2018, when it won 40 seats–its most since 1990–and opposition status.

Rae worked on the Red Cross tainted blood issue and also worked towards a resolution of the fishing conflict in Burnt Church, New Brunswick.

In 2005, Rae wrote a report for the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty on post-secondary education, commonly referred to as the Rae Report. His report called for increased government funding to colleges and universities, and enhanced student aid especially for low-income students. The report also suggested that individual institutions ought to be able to determine what rate of tuition fees to charge, free from government controls, which generated controversy. Student groups including the Canadian Federation of Students have objected, noting the significant recent increases in tuition fees in Ontario under the government of Mike Harris, and the 57 per cent increase in tuition fees during Rae&#x27;s own tenure as premier. Ontario NDP leader Howard Hampton also criticized the report. Rae defended his report, arguing that low income non-university individuals would not benefit from a tuition freeze/lowering, as well as being forced to bear the tax burden needed to enact it.

Rae has also become involved with international issues; in 2002 and 2003, as chair of the Forum of Federations he helped oversee constitutional discussions between the government of Sri Lanka and Tamil Tiger rebels. On April 26, 2005, he was appointed to advise Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan on whether or not there should be a government inquiry into the 1985 Air India disaster. On November 23, 2005, Rae recommended further inquiry into the investigation and prosecution.

In July 2005, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot; both reported that Rae was again being considered for appointment to the position of Governor General. However, Rae was passed over again, this time in favour of Michaëlle Jean.

== Return to politics as a Liberal ==
In a July 2005 interview with Michael Valpy, Rae indicated that he was still committed to public life and public service. Valpy&#x27;s feature on Rae included a comment by Arlene Perly Rae that he could return to politics if there was a national unity crisis.

On November 23, 2005, Rae presented his recommendations that there should be a formal but focused inquiry into the &quot;Air India&quot; disaster. Two days later, Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan announced Rae&#x27;s appointment to conduct a limited inquiry into &quot;Air India&quot; under a government order-in-council. Rae produced a comprehensive report outlining the key issues that could be addressed, leaving Air India Victims&#x27; families spokeswoman Lata Pada &quot;encouraged that demands for answers will be addressed&quot;.

On August 24, 2005, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Rae was under &quot;mounting pressure&quot; to run for the federal Liberals in the 2006 general election. Though it was unclear how long the Air India inquiry was to last, Rae&#x27;s appointment precluded any possibility of his running as a candidate in the January 23 election. A poll by SES Research suggested that Rae was tied for second place behind Frank McKenna as a prospective candidate to lead the federal Liberals. McKenna decided afterwards not to contest the leadership.

The new government of Stephen Harper appointed a judge to handle the Air India inquiry in March 2006 thus releasing Rae from his previous commitment and freeing him for a possible run for the Liberal Party leadership.

In a speech to the Canadian Club of Winnipeg on March 13, 2006, Rae expressed his interest in uniting the &quot;progressive&quot; forces of Canada to regain a majority government in the House of Commons of Canada. &quot;There&#x27;s a progressive record that&#x27;s shared by a majority of Canadians, but so far, we have not succeeded in becoming a majority in the House of Commons, so we must think a bit about how that can happen.&quot;

=== 2006 leadership election ===
On April 5, 2006, Rae applied for membership in the Liberal Party of Canada. His candidacy for the federal party leadership was supported by Greg Sorbara and George Smitherman, former Chrétien aides Eddie Goldenberg and Rae&#x27;s brother John, as well as former top Martin advisor John Webster and others associated with the Martin camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC News Rae joins Liberal 2006/04/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his candidacy on April 24, 2006. At his campaign launch he responded to his critics by saying, &quot;I made mistakes before I was in politics, I made mistakes when I was in politics, I made mistakes as premier ... I can only tell you I have learned from those mistakes and I am the wiser for them.&quot; Rae&#x27;s predecessor as premier, David Peterson, who was supporting Michael Ignatieff, criticized Rae&#x27;s entry into the race due to his record as NDP provincial premier, though insisting that he did not hold a personal grudge against Rae.

On May 12, 2006, Trudeau-era Deputy Prime Minister Allan MacEachen backed Rae&#x27;s leadership bid becoming honorary campaign chair. On June 16, former Ontario Liberal Party leader and provincial treasurer Robert Nixon, who sat as leader of the opposition to Rae&#x27;s Ontario government for a time, endorsed Rae. He was also endorsed by MPs Irwin Cotler, Ujjal Dosanjh, Lawrence MacAulay, Diane Marleau and Brian Murphy, as well as several Senators. Rival candidate Maurizio Bevilacqua withdrew from the contest on August 14 to endorse Rae, and Carolyn Bennett did the same on September 15, followed by Hedy Fry on September 25 and John Godfrey on October 20.
On the night of December 1 at the Convention, Rae spoke freely without notes rather than make a formal speech. Rival candidate Joe Volpe announced his support for Rae after the speeches were concluded. On the morning of December 2, after finishing second on the first ballot, rival candidate Scott Brison, moved to Rae and yet another rival candidate, Ken Dryden, moved to him after the second ballot. However, Rae lost his bid for the leadership in the third round of Convention balloting, placing third behind both Michael Ignatieff and Stéphane Dion, who had leapfrogged into first after receiving the support of Gerard Kennedy. Rae then freed his delegates and did not indicate whom he supported on the final ballot; Dion won the leadership.

Despite the loss of the Liberal leadership, Rae had indicated that he would like to run for a federal seat in the House of Commons in the next federal election. On March 7, 2007, Rae announced that he would seek the Liberal nomination in Toronto Centre. On March 26, 2007, he won the party&#x27;s nomination, defeating Toronto lawyer and human rights advocate Meredith Cartwright with 532 votes to her 267.

Several days following his defeat at the leadership convention it was reported that Rae&#x27;s wife, Arlene Perly Rae was approached by a delegate who did not know who she was, and who told her that she should not vote for Rae because his wife is Jewish. A flyer was also sent electronically to convention delegates, stating that Rae&#x27;s wife was a vice-president of the Canadian Jewish Congress and that he was a supporter of Israeli apartheid. The Canadian Press reported that the flyer was produced by Ron Saba, the editor of a small Montreal journal. Newly elected Liberal leader Stéphane Dion issued a press release condemning the &quot;hateful comments&quot; made against Rae and his wife, saying that they are &quot;reprehensible and will not be tolerated within the Liberal Party of Canada&quot;, adding that &quot;there is no room for abhorrent comments such as these within our Party&quot;.

Rae was named co-chair of the Liberals&#x27; platform development committee, with Scott Brison.

=== Federal Liberal MP ===

In the by-election held on March 17, 2008, Rae won handily. Toronto Centre had historically been one of the few ridings in the former Metro Toronto where the old Progressive Conservatives had a realistic chance of winning. However, since 1993, the Liberals have dominated the riding (as has been the case with most Toronto ridings), carrying it by 10,000 votes or more. Rae kept this tradition going; he finished almost 11,000 votes ahead of his closest opponent and with more than 4,400 votes than his five opponents combined (14,187 to 9,764). Rae&#x27;s candidacy was endorsed by the former Conservative candidate Mark Warner, who was dropped due to disagreements with the party on social and urban issues. Rae had denounced the Tories&#x27; decision to drop Warner, calling it a &quot;national disgrace.&quot;

Rae returned to Parliament on March 31, 2008, after a 25-year absence. He was immediately promoted to the Liberal shadow cabinet as Foreign Affairs critic (shadow foreign minister). In that role he publicly supported Iraq War resisters seeking asylum in Canada before and during the 2008 election campaign. He was re-elected to his Commons&#x27; seat in the fall 2008 federal election. When Dion announced that he would resign the leadership in May 2009 after the party&#x27;s poor results, Rae became a candidate in the ensuing Liberal leadership election.

Rae took part in negotiations for the Liberals to form a coalition with the NDP, with support from the Bloc Québécois. They planned to pass a motion of non-confidence in the Conservative government, not unlike what Rae had done in 1979 and 1985. After Prime Minister Harper convinced the Governor General to prorogue parliament on December 4, 2008, and with Dion pressured to resign immediately as party leader, Rae took on the role of coalition spokesman.

Rae found it more difficult to garner support than he had in the last leadership contest, with his 2006 campaign co-chair now supporting Ignatieff. As it was obvious that Ignatieff had lined up enough support to become the party&#x27;s leader, Rae withdrew on December 9, 2008. He has since criticized Ignatieff&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the coalition with the NDP.

He served as Foreign Affairs critic in the shadow cabinets of both Dion and Ignatieff. On June 9, 2009, Rae was denied entry by Sri Lankan Immigration officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Colombo, Sri Lanka on grounds that he was &quot;a threat to national security and sympathetic to the Tamil Tigers rebel group&quot;. Rae responded, &quot;Sri Lanka is afraid of dialogue, afraid of discussion, afraid of engagement ... If this is how they treat me, imagine how they treat people who can&#x27;t speak out.&quot; Rae has described Sri Lanka as &#x27;a very dangerous place to be a journalist. &quot;It&#x27;s a very dangerous place to be any kind of Tamil right now and this is nuts.&quot;

In November 2009, Rae sponsored a motion for Canada to recognize Black Ribbon Day to commemorate the victims of Nazi and Communist regimes.

==== Interim Liberal leader ====
In the aftermath of the 2011 federal election in which the Liberals were reduced to third place behind the NDP, Rae speculated on national television about the possibility of future co-operation between the two parties. Following Ignatieff&#x27;s announcement that he would be resigning as leader, Rae was touted as a possible successor. However, his advocacy of a possible Liberal-NDP merger caused consternation among some Liberals. Former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien reportedly called senior Liberals urging Rae&#x27;s selection as interim leader. However, the Liberal National Board announced that the interim leader position could only be held by an individual who agreed not to seek the permanent leadership and not to seek to change the party or merge it with another party during his tenure.

On May 19, 2011, Rae declared that he would not be running for leadership for the Liberal Party, but would instead seek the interim leadership position. He was chosen over Quebec MP Marc Garneau for the interim leadership on May 25, 2011. While Rae had been widely expected to resign the post of interim leader and make a bid for the permanent leadership he announced on June 13, 2012, that he would not be a candidate in the Liberal leadership election.

Earlier in 2011, Rae was voted &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; Parliamentarian of the Year by members of the 41st Parliament. Journalist Carol Goar viewed Rae as the de facto leader of the Opposition in the six months between the death of NDP leader Jack Layton in August 2011 and the election of Thomas Mulcair in March 2012. When Justin Trudeau was elected the new permanent leader in April 2013, Rae had become the longest serving interim leader, having served almost two years in this capacity. As new leader, Trudeau named Rae the Liberal party&#x27;s foreign affairs critic.

When Justin Trudeau won the 2015 elections and became Prime Minister, Rae was given considerable credit for laying the foundations for the turnaround in the fortunes of the Liberal Party.

== Post-political career ==
On June 19, 2013, Rae announced that he would be leaving parliament in order to serve as chief negotiator and counsel for the Matawa First Nations in Northern Ontario&#x27;s Ring of Fire; his resignation took effect on July 31. Rae also joined the University of Toronto School of Public Policy and Governance as a distinguished senior fellow, effective July 1, 2013. On July 13, Rae joined the National Advisory Board for Fair Vote Canada, an organization promoting electoral reform for Canadian elections. Later in July, Rae became the chairman of the board for the FN (PTP) Group Limited Partnership (FNLP), which represents the 15 British Columbian First Nations that signed a $200 million commercial deal with the Pacific Trail Pipelines Limited Partnership, a part of the Kitimat LNG Project that plans to use a pipeline to move liquified natural gas to a terminal on the coast of British Columbia. In February 2014, Rae became a partner in the law firm Olthuis Kleer Townshend LLP, a law firm which specializes in representing Aboriginal communities across the country.

After stepping down, Rae has also become a public speaker focusing on Canada&#x27;s role in the world, Aboriginal issues, human rights, healthcare, and education.

In August 2018, Saudi Arabia expelled Canada&#x27;s ambassador, and froze trade with Canada. Rae wrote on Twitter: &quot;The Brits and the Trumpians run for cover and say &#x27;we&#x27;re friends with both the Saudis and the Canadians. Thanks for the support for human rights, guys, and we&#x27;ll remember this one for sure.&quot;

===Diplomatic career===
In late 2017, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed Rae Canada&#x27;s special envoy to Myanmar in response to the Rohingya human rights crisis and the suspected ethnic cleansing of the minority population by the Myanmar government. Rae advised the prime minister on the issue and was expected to attempt to obtain permission from Myanmar to visit Rakhine province. He also has a mandate &quot;to promote accountability for alleged crimes perpetrated against vulnerable populations, including the Rohingya Muslim community, other religious and ethnic minorities, and women and girls&quot;.

On March 10, 2020, Prime Minister Trudeau expanded Rae&#x27;s role naming him as Canada’s Special Envoy on Humanitarian and Refugee Issues.
On July 6, 2020, Trudeau named him Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations.

In November 2020, Rae called on the UN to investigate evidence of genocide against the Uighur minority in China. After the killing of Russia military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in April 2023, Rae made a statement on Twitter describing him as a &quot;vitriolic propagandist&quot; for his support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia lodged a formal diplomatic protest to Canada. He was appointed co-facilitator of the 8th Review of the UN&#x27;s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, a process he led to a consensus adoption by the UN General Assembly in June 2023. 

On 25 July 2024, Rae was elected the eightieth President of the Economic and Social Council for the 2025 Session.

<text>Camden Town is a London Underground station in Camden Town. It is a major junction for the Northern line, as it is where the Edgware and High Barnet branches merge from the north, and is also where they split to the south into the Bank and Charing Cross branches for the journey through Central London. It is particularly busy with visitors to the Camden markets at weekends, and, until 2019, was exit-only on Sundays to prevent overcrowding.

Northbound, the next stations are on the Edgware branch and on the High Barnet branch. Southbound, the next stations are on the Bank branch and on the Charing Cross branch. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==

===Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway===

The station was first proposed as part of the original route of the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR) (now part of the Northern line). Proposals for the line had existed since 1893, but construction did not begin until the American entrepreneur Charles Tyson Yerkes invested in the line in October 1900. Work started in July 1902, and the station was opened on 22 June 1907 by David Lloyd George, then President of the Board of Trade. The line here branched into two routes, to Hampstead and to Highgate. The line to Hampstead (now the Edgware branch) is under Chalk Farm Road; the line to Highgate (now the High Barnet branch) is under Kentish Town Road. With the narrowness of the roads above, and the necessity to keep directly beneath them to avoid having to pay compensation to landowners during construction, on both branches the northbound platform is directly above the southbound one. The two roads meet at an angle of 35° forcing the station into an unusual V shape. The surface building was designed by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London&#x27;s (UERL&#x27;s) architect Leslie Green.

At the apex of the V was a junction allowing northbound trains to take either of the branches north, and likewise allow the trains south from the branches to join the single southbound track under Camden High Street. This resulted in four connecting tunnels. When the CCE&amp;HR and City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) lines were joined together after the C&amp;SLR became part of the Underground Group on 1 January 1913, a short extension was planned from the Euston terminus of the City &amp; South London Railway to connect with the CCE&amp;HR south of Camden Town station allowing services to run from both City and West End branches to and from the Hampstead and Highgate branches. City branch services were extended to this station on 20 April 1924. The work required to join the two lines together at Camden Town was one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the Underground, and was undertaken without disrupting any existing services. It added another four tunnels that allows trains to proceed to or from either the Edgware or High Barnet branch on to or off both the City or Charing Cross branch without following conflicting paths. The multiple junction tunnels are effectively located beneath Camden High Street.

The original lifts and emergency stairs to the platforms were inside the vertex of the V, leading to four passageways, one to each of the platforms, with return passageways back to the lifts. With growing patronage and increasing congestion the lifts were later replaced by escalators that came into service on 7 October 1929 with an escalator heading from the station building to a circulating area at the northern end of the platforms. This has only two pairs of parallel passageways, one for each branch (northbound), with a small side passage on each leading to the lower southbound platforms. One set of the original lift passageways became part of the ventilation system, but the remaining one adds to the confusion of the station.

===Northern line===
The line, known post-merger for many years as the &#x27;Edgware - Morden&#x27; line, was formally referred to as the Northern line from 28 August 1937.

The station was damaged by a bomb on 14 October 1940 during the Blitz. One person was killed. Shortly afterwards, Camden Town was chosen as one of eight stations on the Northern line where dedicated air-raid shelters would be constructed alongside the line, capable of accommodating 640,000 people.

===2003 derailment===
On 19 October 2003, the last carriage of a 1995 stock train derailed on the approach to the station while traversing points in the connecting tunnels that connect the various Northern line branches. Seven passengers were injured, six of them with minor injuries. Two carriages were seriously damaged by the impact. After the accident, trains were restricted to travelling either from the Edgware branch to the Bank branch or from the High Barnet branch to the Charing Cross branch. Full use of the junction was restored in March 2004.

Following the derailment, a joint report by London Underground and its maintenance contractor Tube Lines concluded that poor track geometry was the main cause of the derailment. Extra friction arising out of striations (scratches) on a newly installed set of points had allowed the leading wheel of the last carriage to climb the rail and therefore derail. The track at the derailment site is on a very tight bend in a tight tunnel bore, which prevents canting the track by dipping the height of one rail relative to the other, the normal solution in this sort of situation.

===Future expansion and upgrade===

The station is too small for current passenger demand, with just two escalators and too few passageways between Northern line platforms. The station is particularly busy at weekends with tourists visiting Camden Market and Camden High Street, with entry to the station prohibited on Sunday afternoons to prevent overcrowding on the station&#x27;s narrow platforms. A 2017 consultation suggested that by 2021, weekday passenger demand at the station was expected to grow by 40 per cent.

London Underground originally submitted redevelopment plans in the early 2000s, a £130m project that would have eased congestion and provided step free access – with residential and office development above the new station. However, the project involved demolition of all buildings between Buck Street, Camden High Street and Kentish Town Road – including Buck Street Market, Electric Ballroom and the ox-blood tiled Leslie Green station building itself. London Underground&#x27;s reasoning was that land was required for a temporary entrance for the station while the new station was built. Complaints regarding the loss of these buildings and the market – as well as complaints regarding out-of-place and out-of-scale development when compared to the remainder of Camden Town – led to a public inquiry, which was held in 2004. In 2005, Transport for London had their Transport and Works Act order refused by the office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the scheme was subsequently cancelled.
In 2013, TfL announced new redevelopment plans given the continuing congestion and high passenger demand at the station. Instead of the previously aborted scheme, TfL proposed a new station building built on the north side of Buck Street, on the site of the vacated Hawley School, avoiding the need to demolish both the original station and the other previously-threatened buildings. As well as this new station entrance, expansion work would take place throughout the station with new escalators and passageways and step-free access - tripling the size of the station. In the 2017 consultation, construction work was estimated to take four years to complete. In 2018, following the delays to Crossrail and the knock on effects on TfL&#x27;s business plan, the station upgrade was placed on hold indefinitely.

==Station layout==

As one of only three stations where transfers between the Bank and Charing Cross branches are possible and the northern of the two junctions between them, Camden Town features a complex platform arrangement. Like its sister station of Kennington, the station has four platforms with cross-platform interchanges available between branches.

However, unlike at Kennington, since trains do not terminate at Camden Town there are no terminus platforms or loop to allow terminating trains to turn around. Instead, all northbound trains heading towards Edgware use platform 1 and those heading towards High Barnet or Mill Hill East use platform 3. Trains heading southbound to either central branch use platforms 2 if coming from Edgware and 4 if coming from High Barnet or Mill Hill East respectively.

==Connections==

===Out-of-station interchange===

Camden Road station is located 450 metres north-east of the station for London Overground services to Stratford, Hackney, and Richmond.

===Buses===

London Buses routes 1, 24, 27, 29, 31, 88, 134, 214, 253, 274 and night routes N5, N20, N27, N28, N29, N31, N253 and N279 serve the station. Route 46 passes nearby.

==Air raid shelter==
Camden Town is one of eight London Underground stations with a deep-level air-raid shelter underneath it. The entrances are on Buck Street (near the market) and Underhill Street with the shelter tunnels reaching from just north of Hawley Crescent to south of Greenland Street.

<text>Púxiān Wànnú () was a Jurchen warlord who established the short-lived Eastern Xia dynasty in 13th-century China.

Púxiān Wànnú is also mentioned under the name fūjīū tāīīshī () in Persian historical sources such as the &quot;Jami&#x27; al-tawarikh&quot;.

He originally served the waning Jin dynasty under pressure from the Mongol Empire. While the Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Jin, a Khitan chief Yelü Liuge (耶律留哥) revolted against the dynasty in Liaodong in 1211 and made contact with the Mongol Empire in the next year. In 1214 Jin dispatched Puxian Wannu to Liaodong, but he was defeated around Kaiyuan. While Mukhali of the Mongol Empire invaded Northern China, Puxian Wannu rebelled against Jin and founded the Dazhen (大眞) kingdom in Dongjing (Liaoyang) in 1215. He adopted the title of Tianwang (天王 lit. &quot;Heavenly King&quot;) and named his era Tiantai (天泰).

As a result of an internal strife in the Eastern Liao, Yelü Liuge was expelled and sought support from Genghis. The Khitans got a counterattack from Jin and fled to Goryeo without permission. Puxian Wannu capitulated to Mukhali&#x27;s army and sent his son (铁哥/鐵哥 &quot;Tiěgē&quot;) as a hostage in 1216. However, he revolted soon after that and fled to an island while the Mongol army invaded Liaoxi and Liaodong.

In 1217 he moved from Dongjing to the Tumen River basin possibly to avoid both Mongol and Jin oppressions. He again named his kingdom Eastern Xia or Dongxia (东夏/東夏), established the capital around Yanji and called it Nanjing (南京 literally: &quot;Southern Capital&quot;). His domain extended north to Laoyeling Mountains, south to Hamgyŏngnamdo in modern-day North Korea, east to the Sea of Japan and west to the Zhangguangcailing Mountains, corresponding to the borderlands of modern-day China, Russia and North Korea.

He seems to have submitted to the Mongol Empire again. In 1218 the Mongol and Eastern Xia armies jointly intruded into Goryeo to subdue the Khitan remnants. Goryeo also joined the campaign and the Khitans were exterminated. The Mongol army retreated after establishing a &quot;sibling&quot; relationship with Goryeo. Mongol officers with Eastern Xia delegates came to Goryeo to exact tribute.

In 1222 Puxian Wannu revolted against the Mongol Empire yet again while Genghis Khan made an expedition toward the west. Since Goryeo rejected his demand for the opening of trading posts on the border, he invaded Goryeo many times. In 1233 Ögedei&#x27;s son Güyük attacked Eastern Xia with a large force and captured Puxian Wannu. Wannu was executed by beheading after his capture, and the Eastern Xia collapsed nearly immediately afterwards. With the demise of Puxian Wannu, Jurchen remnants in Manchuria surrendered resulting in almost two hundred years of Mongol rule in Manchuria thereafter. The Jin dynasty was overthrown in the next year.

<text>Gongsun Kang (; 200s to 210s) was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He became a vassal of the state of Cao Wei in the early Three Kingdoms period.

==Life==
Gongsun Kang was a son of Gongsun Du, the Administrator of Liaodong appointed by the Han central government. In 204, he inherited his father&#x27;s appointment and controlled the territories of Liaodong, Xuantu and Lelang commanderies. He was nominally subject to the Han chancellor Cao Cao, while keeping his domain semi-independent of the central government. In , when Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi fled to Liaodong after being defeated by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces, Gongsun Kang killed the Yuans and sent their heads to Cao Cao.

In 204, Gongsun Kang helped invade Goguryeo after the older brother of King Sansang of Goguryeo, Balgi, went to Gongsun Kang and requested 30,000 soldiers to invade Goguryeo so that Balgi could become king. Around this time, Kang established the Daifang Commandery by separating the southern half from the Lelang commandery. Although Goguryeo defeated the first invasion and killed Balgi, Kang invaded Goguryeo again in 209 and seized some of its territory and weakened Goguryeo. Pressure from Liaodong forced Goguryeo to move their capital in the Hun River valley to the Yalu River valley near Hwando.

When Gongsun Kang died, his younger brother Gongsun Gong succeeded him because his sons were still young at the time. Gongsun Kang&#x27;s son Gongsun Yuan took back control of Liaodong in 228.

<text>The Curtiss JN &quot;Jenny&quot; is a series of biplanes built by the Glenn Curtiss Aeroplane Company of Hammondsport, New York, later the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. Although the Curtiss JN series was originally produced as a training aircraft for the US Army, the &quot;Jenny&quot; (the common nickname derived from &quot;JN&quot;) continued after World War I as a civilian aircraft, becoming the &quot;backbone of American postwar [civil] aviation&quot;.

Thousands of surplus Jennys were sold at bargain prices to private owners in the years after the war, and became central to the barnstorming era that helped awaken the US to civil aviation through much of the 1920s.

==Design and development==
Curtiss combined the best features of the model J and model N trainers, built for the US Army and US Navy, and began producing the JN or &quot;Jenny&quot; series of aircraft in 1915. Curtiss built only a limited number of the JN-1 and JN-2 biplanes. The design was commissioned by Glenn Curtiss from Englishman Benjamin Douglas Thomas, formerly of the Sopwith Aviation Company.

The JN-2 was an equal-span biplane with ailerons controlled by a shoulder yoke in the aft cockpit. It was deficient in performance, particularly climbing, because of excessive weight. The improved JN-3 incorporated unequal spans with ailerons only on the upper wings, controlled by a wheel. In addition, a foot bar was added to control the rudder.

The 1st Aero Squadron of the Aviation Section, US Signal Corps received eight JN-2s at San Diego in July 1915. The squadron was transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in August to work with the Field Artillery School, during which one JN-2 crashed, resulting in a fatality. The pilots of the squadron met with its commander, Capt. Benjamin Foulois, to advise that the JN-2 was unsafe because of low power, shoddy construction, lack of stability, and overly sensitive rudder. Foulois and his executive officer Capt. Thomas D. Milling disagreed, and flights continued until a second JN-2 crashed in early September, resulting in the grounding of the six remaining JN-2s until mid-October. When two new JN-3s were delivered, the grounded aircraft were then upgraded in accordance with the new design. In March 1916, these eight JN-3s were deployed to Mexico for aerial observation during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916–1917.

After the successful deployment of the JN-3, Curtiss produced a development, known as the JN-4, with orders from both the US Army and an order in December 1916 from the Royal Flying Corps for a training aircraft to be based in Canada. The Canadian version, the JN-4 (Canadian), also known as the &quot;Canuck&quot;, had some differences from the American version, including a lighter airframe, ailerons on both wings, a bigger and more rounded rudder, and differently shaped wings, stabilizer, and elevators.

As many as 12 JN-4 aircraft were fitted with an aftermarket Sikorsky wing by the then-fledgling company in the late 1920s.

==Operational history==

The Curtiss JN-4 is possibly North America&#x27;s most famous World War I aircraft. It was widely used during World War I to train beginning pilots, with an estimated 95% of all trainees having flown a JN-4. The US version was called &quot;Jenny&quot;, a derivation from its official designation. It was a twin-seat (student in front of instructor), dual-control biplane. Its tractor propeller and maneuverability made it ideal for initial pilot training with a Curtiss OX-5 V8 engine giving a top speed of and a service ceiling of . The British used the JN-4 (Canadian), along with the Avro 504, for their primary World War I trainer using the Canadian Aeroplanes Ltd. indigenous variant. Many Royal Flying Corps pilots earned their wings on the JN-4, both in Ontario and later in winter facilities at Camp Taliaferro, Texas.

Although ostensibly a training aircraft, the Jenny was extensively modified while in service to undertake additional roles. Due to its robust but easily adapted structure able to be modified with ski undercarriage, the Canadian Jenny was flown year-round, even in inclement weather. The removable turtle deck behind the cockpits allowed for conversion to stretcher or additional supplies and equipment storage, with the modified JN-4s becoming the first aerial ambulances, carrying out this role both during wartime and in later years. Most of the 6,813 Jennys built were unarmed, although some had machine guns and bomb racks for advanced training. With deployment limited to North American bases, none saw combat service in World War I.

The Curtiss factory in Buffalo, New York, was the largest such facility in the world, but due to production demands, from November 1917 to January 1919, six different manufacturers were involved in production of the definitive JN-4D. Production from spare or reconditioned parts continued sporadically until 1927, although most of the final orders were destined for the civilian market in Canada and the United States.

Like the re-engined JN-4H version of the most-produced JN-4 subtype, the final production version of the aircraft was the JN-6, powered by a Wright Aeronautical license-built, 150 hp (112 kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 V-8, first ordered in 1918 for the US Navy. A floatplane version was built for the navy, which was so modified, it was essentially a different airframe. This was designated the N-9. In US Army Air Service usage, the JN-4s and JN-6s were configured to the JNS (&quot;S&quot; for &quot;standardized&quot;) model. The Jenny remained in service with the US Army until 1927.

After World War I, thousands were sold on the civilian market, including one to Charles Lindbergh in May 1923, in which he then soloed. Surplus US Army aircraft were sold (some still in their unopened packing crates) for as little as $50, flooding the market. With private and commercial flying in North America unhampered by regulations concerning their use, pilots found the Jenny&#x27;s stability and slow speed made it ideal for stunt flying and aerobatic displays in the barnstorming era between the world wars, with the nearly identical Standard J-1 aircraft often used alongside it. Some were still flying into the 1930s.

JN-4 airframes were used to produce early Weaver Aircraft Company/Advance Aircraft Company/Waco aircraft, such as the Waco 6.

===Notable firsts===
Between 1917 and 1919, the JN-4 type accounted for several significant aviation firsts while in service with the US Army Signal Corps Aviation Section and the United States Marine Corps (USMC), including flying the first US Air Mail in May 1918.

In a series of tests conducted at the US Army&#x27;s Langley Field in Hampton, Virginia, in July and August 1917, the world&#x27;s first &quot;plane-to-plane&quot; and &quot;ground-to-plane, and vice versa&quot; communications by radiotelephony (as opposed to radiotelegraphy which had been developed earlier) were made to and from modified US Army JN-4s by Western Electric Company (Bell Labs) design engineers Lewis M. Clement and Raymond Heising, the developers of the experimental wind generator-powered airborne wireless voice transmitter and receiver equipment.

In early 1919, a USMC JN-4 was also credited with what is believed to be the first successful dive-bombing attack during the United States occupation of Haiti. USMC pilot Lt Lawson H. Sanderson mounted a carbine barrel in front of the windshield of his JN-4 (previously, an unarmed trainer that had a machine gun mounted in the rear cockpit) as an improvised bomb sight that was lined up with the long axis of his aircraft, loaded a bomb in a canvas mail bag that was attached to the JN-4&#x27;s belly, and launched a single-handed raid at treetop level, in support of a USMC unit that had been trapped by Haitian Cacos rebels. Although the JN-4 almost disintegrated in the pullout, the attack was effective and led to Sanderson in 1920 developing further dive-bombing techniques to provide Marine pilots with close aerial support to infantry comrades.

== Variants ==
Although the first series of JN-4s was virtually identical to the JN-3, the JN-4 series was based on production orders from 1915 to 1919.
*JN-1 — possibly unofficial designation of the second Model J, which served as the prototype for the Model JN.
**JN-1W — Two aircraft that appear in US Navy records, which may have been confused with the Models S-4 and S-5.
*JN-2 — first production version, 8 built
*JN-3 — variant with new unequal-span wings and improved flight controls, 97 built for the RNAS (some sources indicate 91, but serial numbers total 97; 12 built in Canada) plus 2 for the US Army. The six surviving JN-2s were modified to this standard.
*JN-4A — production version of the JN-4, 781 built
*JN-4B — This version was powered by an OX-2 piston engine; 76 were built for the US Army, and nine for the US Navy.
*JN-4C — experimental version, only two were built
*JN-4 (Canadian) Canuck — Canadian-built version, 1,260 built by Canadian Aeroplanes Ltd. for the RFC in Canada/RAF in Canada and USAAC: Independently derived from the JN-3, it had a lighter airframe, ailerons on both wings, a bigger and more rounded rudder, and differently shaped wings, stabilizer, and elevators. Its use by the USAAC was curtailed as the lighter structure was claimed to cause more accidents than the US-built aircraft, although no air fatalities were attributed to the structural integrity of the type.
*JN-4D — improved version, adopting the control stick from the JN-4 (Canadian) 2,812 built
**JN-4D-2 — One prototype only, the engine mount was revised to eliminate the down thrust position.
*JN-4H — two-seat advanced trainer biplane with ailerons on both wings, 929 built for the US Army, notable for introducing the use of the Wright Aeronautical license-built Hispano-Suiza 8 V-8 engine for greater power and reliability
**JN-4HT — two-seat, dual-control trainer version
**JN-4HB — bombing trainer version
**JN-4HG — gunnery trainer version
**JN-4HM — communications conversion of JN-4HT, powered by Wright-Hisso E 150-hp (112-kW), six converted, used to fly the first US Air Mail (May–August, 1918)
*JN-5H — advanced trainer biplane, only one built
*JN-6 — improved version of JN-5 trainer biplane series, notably used four ailerons, 1,035 built for the US Army and five for the US Navy
*JN-6H — improved version of the JN-6
**JN-6BH — bomber trainer version
**JN-6HG-1 — two-seat, dual-control trainer version, 560 built from JN-6 production, 34 for US Navy
**JN-6HG-2 — single-control gunnery trainer. 90 delivered
**JN-6HO — single-control observer trainer version, 106 delivered
**JN-6HP — single-control pursuit fighter trainer version
*JNS (&quot;standardized&quot;)  — During the postwar years of the early 1920s, between 200 and 300 US Army aircraft were upgraded to a common standard of equipment and modernized.

===&quot;Specials&quot;===

*Allison Monoplane — conversion of JN-4 (Can) G-CAJL by the Allison Company, Kansas, that mounted a parasol wing in place of the biplane configuration, only one conversion made
*Curtiss Stinson Special (1918) — a custom-built, single-seat aircraft for Katherine Stinson, constructed from the fuselage of a Curtiss Model S plus new biplane wings and JN-4 tail surfaces, powered by a 100-hp (74.5-kW) OXX-6 
*Ericson Special Three — Some reconditioned aircraft built by Canadian Aeroplanes Ltd. were fitted with a third cockpit.
*Hennessey Monoplane — a 1926 monoplane conversion by James R. Hennessey, three-place transport, 90-hp Curtiss OX-5, span: 36 ft (11 m) length: 25 ft (7.6 m)
*Severski 1926 biplane  — a JN-4 modified with a roller/ski undercarriage, one experimental aircraft converted by the Seversky company
*Sperry Monoplane — conversion offered by the Sperry Company that mounted a parasol wing in place of the biplane configuration
*Twin JN — An enlarged twin-engined version of the JN-4, they were powered by two OXX-2 V-8 engines, built in 1916 as the JN-5 for an observation role; among the many other modifications was an enlarged wingspan and new rudder adapted from the Curtiss Model R-4. Two of the series saw action with the US Army on the Mexican border in 1916–1917. A total of eight Twin JNs were built, with two in US Navy service.

==Specifications (JN-4D)==

==Commemorations==
An image of the Curtis Jenny appeared on the first airmail stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1918
===The &quot;Inverted Jenny&quot; stamp===
The &quot;Inverted Jenny&quot; (C-3a) is a 24-cent 1918 US Air Mail postage stamp printing error in which the blue central vignette of US Army Curtiss JN-4HM #38262, the nation&#x27;s first mailplane, appeared as &quot;inverted&quot; on a single sheet of 100 stamps.
===Notable appearances in media===
In 1921, Lee De Forest made a short film &quot;Flying Jenny Airplane&quot; in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process. The film depicted a JN-4 flying, and recorded the sound of the Jenny, as well. The short documentary was the first production of the De Forest Phonofilm company.

Among many later films depicting the barnstorming era when the Jennys &quot;ruled supreme&quot; and played a feature role, was &quot;The 
Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1974). In &quot;The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell&quot; (1955), authentic OX-5 Jennys were showcased as United States Army Air Service training aircraft. Broadcast on April 15, 1987, by PBS, the &quot;National Geographic&quot; special entitled &quot;Treasures from the Past&quot; featured the restoration and first flight by Ken Hyde of a JN-4D that would go on to win the &quot;Lindy Award&quot; at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh &#x27;87.

The stamp also made an appearance in the 1985 film starring Richard Pryor, &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;, in which the titular character mails an &quot;Inverted Jenny&quot; stamp as part of a ploy to very quickly and frivolously spend as much money as possible.

<text>Electric Word was a bimonthly, English-language magazine published in Amsterdam between 1987 and 1990 that offered eclectic reporting on the translation industry, linguistic technology, and computer culture. 
Its editor was Louis Rossetto and it featured avant-garde graphics by the Dutch graphic designer Max Kisman.

==History and profile==
In 1986, Amsterdam-based INK Taalservice, a high-tech translation company serving the new PC industry, launched an English-language magazine &quot;Language Technology&quot;, which covered the burgeoning the technologies used to process language — from PCs to machine translation to networks. Louis Rossetto was the editor of Language Technology. Jane Metcalfe was the magazine&#x27;s ad sales director. The first issue of &quot;Language Technology&quot; was designed by leading edge Dutch graphic designer Max Kisman. It was the first issue of any magazine to be created with desktop publishing software, in this case ReadySetGo, which Rossetto had carried back from its introduction at that year&#x27;s San Francisco MacWorld exhibition.

INK later sold the magazine to a small Dutch media company Media Nederland, who renamed it &quot;Electric Word&quot;.

&quot;Electric Word&quot;&#x27;s circulation grew to include leading research labs at universities, governments, and high tech companies around the world. Cover subjects were as diverse as computer visionary Alan Kay, AI pioneer Marvin Minsky, Timothy Leary, and MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte. &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;’s editor Kevin Kelley proclaimed &quot;Electric Word&quot; &quot;the least boring computer magazine in the world,&quot; which became its tagline.

&quot;Electric Word&quot; was terminated in 1990 due to Media Nederland&#x27;s change of focus. Rossetto and Metcalfe went on to found &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. The last issue of &quot;Electric Word&quot; featured the world&#x27;s first photoshopped magazine cover — of TED founder Richard Saul Wurman

<text>St. Michael&#x27;s College School (also known as St. Michael&#x27;s, St. Mike&#x27;s, and SMCS), is an independent, Catholic school for young men in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Administered by the Basilian Fathers, it is the largest school of its kind in Canada, with an enrolment of approximately 750 students from grades 7 to 12. It is known for its high standard of academics and athletics, notably its ice hockey, football and basketball programs. The hockey program has graduated numerous future National Hockey League ice hockey players. The basketball and football programs have graduated multiple NBA, NFL, and CFL players. St. Michael&#x27;s College School is the affiliate school of Holy Name of Mary College School, an independent, Catholic all-girls school in Mississauga. St. Michael&#x27;s was part of the Metropolitan Separate School Board from 1967 to 1985, but has subsequently operated within the Conference of Independent Schools of Ontario Athletic Association.

==History==
The Congregation of St. Basil (Basilian Fathers) was established as a religious congregation in France in 1822. As a result of the closing of seminaries in France during the French Revolution, two diocesan priests opened a secret school in the mountains of central France.

After several years of operation and a change in the French laws, ten priests serving there openly bound themselves into a religious community. They reasoned that the school, by then located in the nearby city of Annonay, would have a better chance of continuing if it were conducted by a religious congregation that could accept and train new members to continue its operation after the founding fathers’ retirement.

The original members chose St. Basil the Great, a fourth-century teacher, bishop, and doctor of the Church, to be the namesake of the new community.

In the middle of the nineteenth century, the French Basilians came to Canada on an invitation from Bishop de Charbonnel of Toronto. The Bishop saw the need for Catholic schools for the young people of his parishes, especially at the high school level. In his plans to bring Catholic education to more of his people, the Bishop immediately thought of his own education in France. He had been educated at the College of Annonay near Lyon, a school established by the Basilian Fathers.

In September 1852, St. Michael&#x27;s College School opened. It quickly outgrew its original facilities in the basement of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace on Church Street. In 1856, it moved to Clover Hill, a property donated to the Basilian Fathers by John Elmsley. Clover Hill was outside the city at that time, in an area now bounded by Bay, St. Joseph, and St. Mary&#x27;s streets. In 1881, St. Michael&#x27;s was affiliated with St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto for post secondary education.

The school specifically targeted Irish immigrants. The high school section expanded much more rapidly than the college section. In 1902, a new wing was added to the original building and the high school remained here until 1950.

In the years after World War II, it became apparent that the Bay Street buildings were not equal to the challenge of serving a growing student body. At this point the high school section was separated from the University College. In September 1950, St. Michael&#x27;s College School opened its doors at Bathurst Street and St. Clair Avenue, where it is situated today.

In 1967, St. Michael&#x27;s College School entered into partnership with the Metropolitan Separate School Board (known today as the Toronto Catholic District School Board) educating the Board&#x27;s students in Grades 9 and 10. This decision made St. Michael&#x27;s College School both a public and private school, which lasted for approximately 20 years. In September 1985, the Basilian Fathers decided to refuse provincial aid beyond and return St. Michael&#x27;s to its roots as an independent, Catholic high school.

In 1995, a major capital expansion program upgraded the school to include an east wing complete with science classrooms, a library (Odette Library), music and visual arts facilities, a design and technology facility, a 250-seat lecture hall, and an expanded gymnasium. In September 1998, St. Michael&#x27;s College School expanded its academic program to include a Grade 7 and 8 program. The Preparatory school was previously active during the early 1900s.

The school&#x27;s athletic stadium was retrofitted in September 2004 to include a state-of-the-art athletic field complete with artificial turf, an electronic scoreboard, stadium lighting, and an air supported dome that covers a third of the field for use during the winter months. The St. Michael&#x27;s College School Centre for the Arts was the fourth and final phase of this revitalization project. The St. Michael&#x27;s College School Centre for the Arts opened in April 2010, and hosts annual school stage productions of musicals and dramas in addition to concerts and other events.

== Campus ==

The school&#x27;s campus is located at Bathurst Street and St. Clair Avenue at the edge of Toronto&#x27;s Forest Hill neighbourhood. The main school building was designed by Canadian architect Ernest Cormier and completed in 1950. Its most recognizable features are the distinctive chapel tower and yellow brickwork, similar to Cormier&#x27;s earlier work at the Université de Montréal.

In the late 1990s, a major expansion programme was undertaken, with two major academic wings and a gymnasium extension added to the original building. The additions contain classrooms tailored to the science, art and music programmes, a substantial lecture hall, several computer laboratories, and a large library. An outdoor courtyard adjacent to the cafeteria overlooked by classrooms is popular for major school events. The school&#x27;s residence wing, originally built to accommodate boarding students, functioned as a Basilian house until 2008 when it was removed to make room for the school&#x27;s &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; Centre for the Arts. The $10 million facility was completed in the April 2010.

There are a number of sports facilities located on campus, including the St. Michael&#x27;s College School Arena. The school&#x27;s basketball court is named after former vice-principal, teacher, coach, and alumnus Paul Dignan. In 2005, a major overhaul of the stadium was undertaken. Renamed in honour of its benefactor, billionaire alumnus Eugene Melnyk, it features an artificial turf field, a rubberized running track, and lighting for evening events. During the winter, an air supported dome covers part of the field to allow for use year-round.

== Athletics ==

Over 90 St. Michael&#x27;s Majors alumni have played in the National Hockey League. From the Majors, there are twelve Hockey Hall of Fame inductees: Bobby Bauer, Turk Broda, Gerry Cheevers, Dick Duff, Tim Horton, Red Kelly, Dave Keon, Ted Lindsay, Frank Mahovlich, Joe Primeau, Murray Costello, and Jim Gregory. Additionally, Hall of Famer Reg Noble played for St. Michael&#x27;s before the team adopted the Majors name.

The school&#x27;s flagship hockey team, the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors, won the Memorial Cup four times before ceasing operation in 1961. The Majors name was revived as an expansion franchise in the Ontario Hockey League from 1996 to 2012, then sold off to become the Mississauga Steelheads. The school also operates the St. Michael&#x27;s Buzzers, at the Tier II Junior &quot;A&quot; level. The school was featured on CBC&#x27;s annual Hockey Day in Canada on January 13, 2007, as the College School was celebrating 100 years of hockey.
The junior and senior football teams are called the Kerry Blues. The Jr. Kerry Blues won their third Ontario Regional Invitational in 2008 (having previously won in 2002 and 2004) In 2008, the Senior Kerry Blues won their seventh Metro Bowl, making the St. Michael&#x27;s Kerry Blues the most bowl-winning team in Ontario. They have won the Metro Bowl three years in a row. There have been many Kerry Blues Football alumni that have gone on to win the CIAU National Football Championship with their respective universities. The 1993 Vanier Cup Champion University of Toronto Varsity Blues had several SMCS Alumni: Christopher Tyndorf, Lou Tiro and Peter Woo. National Football League players Glen Young, O.J. Santiago and Mike Labinjo, each of whom have competed in the Super Bowl, played football while attending St. Michael&#x27;s.

The school competes in the Basil Bowl against other Basilian high schools.

== Bullying and sex crimes ==
In November 2018, police began an investigation after learning of two separate sexual assaults at the school, The school suspended and expelled a number of students. arresting 6 students and with principal Greg Reeves and school president Father Jefferson Thompson resigning the same month. An August 2019 review found that bullying was a “systemic issue” at the school, albeit similar to other comparable schools across Canada. On October 3, 2019, three of the seven students charged pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault with a weapon and assault with a weapon; one of the three also pleading guilty to making child pornography for filming one of the sexual assaults. In December 2019, Ontario Court Justice Brian Weagant sentenced the three students to 2 years&#x27; probation, saying that &quot;the teens had been affected by a normalized bullying culture at the school&quot; and that the school culture normalized bullying and sexual bullying, which Weagant described as being supported by the sweeping culture review conducted by the school in the wake of the criminal charges. One of the two victims of the October 2018 incidents went on to file a C$1.65 million lawsuit against the school, its board, 3 former students, the Basilian Fathers, some coaches and some administrators. One student charged in relation to the attacks filed a C$1m case against Toronto Police stating that he had been a victim and was wrongfully charged.

In 2020, it was revealed that former principal Father Leo Campbell had been known to have &quot;psycho-sexual tendencies&quot; by the Basilian Fathers before his time at St. Michael&#x27;s. Campbell was diagnosed with ephebophilia at Southdown Treatment Centre, an Ontario centre for Catholic clergy, including those accused of sexual abuse, and it was concluded that he should have no unsupervised contact with early teenage boys.

<text>Barron Field (Camp Taliaferro Field #2) is a former World War I military airfield, located West-southwest of Everman, Texas. It operated as a training field for the Air Service, United States Army between 1917 until 1921. It was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into World War I in April 1917.

After the United States&#x27; entry into World War I in April 1917, General John J. &quot;Blackjack&quot; Pershing invited the British Royal Flying Corps to establish training fields in Texas for the training of American and Canadians volunteers because of its mild weather. After looking at sites in Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Austin, Wichita Falls and Midland, three sites were established in 1917 in the Fort Worth vicinity (known as the &quot;Flying Triangle.&quot;), those being Hicks Field (#1), Barron Field (#2), and Benbrook Field (#3).

Canadians named the training complex [[Camp Taliaferro]] after Walter Taliaferro, a US aviator who had been killed in an accident. Camp Taliaferro was headquartered under the direction of the Air Service, United States Army, which had an administration center near what is now the Will Rodgers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas.

==History==
Taliafero Field No. 2 was used by the Royal Flying Corps from October 1917 to April 1918 as a training field for American and Canadian pilots. It was then turned over to the Air Service, United States Army. The Americans renamed the field Barron Field after Cadet R. J. Barron, who was drowned at Chandler Field, Pennsylvania on 22 August 1917 when the airplane he was flying fell into the water.

===World War I===
Construction on Taliaferro Field #2 began in September 1917, with the first trainees arriving in November to a very crude facility. Most structures were unfinished and personnel lived and worked in canvas tents. It was taken over by the United States Army in February 1918 and renamed Barron Field on 1 May for Cadet Robert J. Barron, on 1 May 1918 who was killed at another flying school.

The Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; became the primary aircraft used for flight training after the Army takeover. Eventually, the base expanded to 600 acres, housing as many as 150 officers and 900 enlisted men. Barron Field saw flight training and daredevil stunting by the likes of Ormer Locklear, and other pioneer barnstorming pilots, sending six squadrons of pilots to France before the war ended in November 1918.

Squadrons assigned to Barron Field:
* Post Headquarters, Taliaferro Field #2, 1 February 1918
: Re-designated Post Headquarters, Barron Field, 1 May 1918-April 1919
* 77th Aero Squadron (II), May 1918
: Re-designated Squadron &quot;A&quot;, July–November 1918
* 106th Aero Squadron (II), March 1918
: Re-designated Squadron &quot;B&quot;, July–November 1918
* 207th Aero Squadron (II), April 1918
: Re-designated: Squadron &quot;C&quot;, July 1918; Transferred September 1918 to Call Field, Texas
* 273d Aero Squadron, February 1918
: Re-designated Squadron &quot;D&quot;, July–November 1918
* Flying School Detachment, November 1918-March 1919 
: Formed from elements of Squadrons A,B,C,D

Service Squadrons trained at Barron Field:
* 351st Aero Squadron (Service), March–July 1918; Deployed to American Expeditionary Forces. France
* 353d Aero Squadron (Service), May–July 1918; Deployed to American Expeditionary Forces. France

After the war ended, the base was closed in April 1919 and was used as an Army storage depot. Military use ended in 1921, and the facility was eventually dismantled and returned to farmland. Over the years, the southern suburbs of Fort Worth have expanded over the area, the airfield now is indistinguishable from the urbanized area. Barron Field was located south of Everman Parkway and west of Oak Grove Road. One small building, used for munitions, has survived, and today a Texas historical marker is located at the site on the west side of Oak Grove Road.

<text>Ormer Leslie &quot;Lock&quot; Locklear (October 28, 1891 – August 2, 1920) was an American daredevil stunt pilot and film actor.

His popular flying circus caught the attention of Hollywood, and he starred in &quot;The Great Air Robbery&quot; (1919), a screenplay about the mid-air piracy of a US airmail plane. In his next film, &quot;The Skywayman&quot;, the plane crashed during a climactic dive, when the lighting team supposedly failed to douse the lights on cue, so Locklear was dazzled and flew blindly into the ground, dying instantly with his co-pilot Milton &quot;Skeets&quot; Elliott. The scene remained on the film.

==Early life==
Born in Greenville, Texas, Locklear was raised in Fort Worth. In 1911, Locklear met Calbraith Perry Rodgers, who landed his plane in Fort Worth to unclog a fuel line. After meeting Rodgers, Locklear became fascinated with aviation and airplanes. Shortly thereafter, Locklear and his brother constructed their own glider.

Upon completing his education, Locklear went to work as a carpenter.

==Flying career==
In October 1917, Locklear joined the U.S. Army Air Service. He trained in Austin, at Camp Dick and Barron Field, becoming a flying instructor. Locklear was an exponent of wing walking to make aircraft repairs in flight.

A second lieutenant at the end of the World War I, Locklear had been assigned to military recruitment when he saw a barnstorming show and realized his own usual flying exploits were far more impressive. After briefly reenlisting, Locklear left the Army in 1919, along with two military colleagues, Milton &quot;Skeets&quot; Elliott and Shirley Short. With manager and promoter William Pickens, they soon obtained aircraft and formed the &quot;Locklear Flying Circus&quot;.

Pickens had a great deal of experience promoting barnstormers, with Locklear being his greatest success. Both men became wealthy and lived in high style. His trademark stunt of jumping from one aircraft to another led Locklear to perfect a transfer from a car, and then the &quot;Dance of Death,&quot; in which two pilots in two aircraft, would switch places in midair.

On April 7, 1920, Locklear was flying in the city of Los Angeles, California, where he was issued the first aviation law violation for reckless aerial driving. He was fined $25.00 ($ in 2025).

==Film career==

The Locklear Flying Circus performed throughout the United States. When they came to the attention of Hollywood, Pickens arranged for Locklear to appear as a stunt man in film work. This opened the way to a movie career in California for Locklear, now considered the foremost &quot;aviation stunt man in the world&quot;. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Pictures, agreed to purchase all of Locklear&#x27;s future air show dates in July 1919 in order to have him on contract for a proposed two-film series. Locklear was signed to star in &quot;The Great Air Robbery&quot;, a film depicting pilots flying air mail.

Principal photography for &quot;The Great Air Robbery&quot; began in July 1919 at DeMille Field 1, Los Angeles, California, owned by producer Cecil B. DeMille. Besides being used as a base for flying, Locklear&#x27;s Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; aircraft was also mounted on a raised wooden platform at the airfield in order to film closeups. &quot;The Great Air Robbery&quot; was primarily an opportunity to showcase the aerial stunts that had made Locklear famous. The studio promotion was extensive, with Laemmle declaring the film was &quot;... the most amazing and unbelievable photodrama of all time.&quot; The promotional campaign included a premiere at the Superba Theatre in Los Angeles, and a two-month personal appearance tour with Locklear.

Reviews were generally favourable, as &quot;The Great Air Robbery&quot; was the first of a cycle of postwar films dealing with the exploits of stunt pilots. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review focused on the exciting elements of the film. &quot;Lieutenant Locklear swings from one airplane to another and crawls out on the tail of a flying machine several thousand feet, presumably, above the earth. The melodrama&#x27;s use of airplanes for midnight mail deliveries, highway, or rather highair, robberies, and battles between the forces of law and lawlessness adds excitement.&quot;

Although &quot;The Great Air Robbery&quot; was a commercial success, Laemmle did not take up the option for a second film starring Locklear, prompting his $25,000 lawsuit against Universal. Unwilling to go back to the air show circuit, Locklear wanted to continue his Hollywood career, and in April 1920, he was signed to star in &quot;The Skywayman&quot; (1920).

Principal photography on &quot;The Skywayman&quot; began on June 11, 1920, with DeMille Field 2 as the main base of operations. Despite Locklear&#x27;s public claim that new stunts &quot;more daring ever filmed&quot; would be involved, the production would rely heavily on models and less on actual stunt flying. Two stunts, a church steeple being toppled by Locklear&#x27;s aircraft and an aircraft-to-train transfer were both problematic and nearly ended in disaster.

==Personal life==

Locklear married Ruby Graves in 1915. The marriage was largely unhappy as Graves and Locklear had vastly different personalities. They separated in 1919 after Locklear moved to Los Angeles to pursue a film career. Despite the marriage being an unhappy one, Graves refused to grant Locklear a divorce. They remained legally married until Locklear&#x27;s death.

While separated from Graves, Locklear met widowed silent film actress
Viola Dana. They began a relationship and were engaged at the time of Locklear&#x27;s death. Dana witnessed the plane crash that killed Locklear. She was so traumatized by the event that she refused to fly for the next 25 years. In 1980, Dana recalled her relationship with Locklear and also spoke about his fatal crash in the documentary &quot;Hollywood&quot;.

==Death==
The last stunt scheduled for filming for &quot;The Skywayman&quot; was a nighttime spin, initially to take place in daylight with cameras fitted with red filters to simulate darkness. Locklear, under a lot of pressure, with not only his family life being in upheaval but also learning that studio head William Fox was not going to extend his contract beyond one film, demanded that he be allowed to fly at night. The studio relented, and on August 2, 1920, publicity surrounding the stunt led to a large crowd gathering to witness the filming of the unusual stunt. Large studio arc lights were set up on DeMille Field 2 to illuminate the Curtiss &quot;Jenny&quot;, to be doused as the aircraft entered its final spin. The dive towards some oil derricks was to make it appear that the airplane crashed beside the oil well. As arranged, Locklear had forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks so that he could see to pull out of the dive, saying that &quot;When you take the lights off, I&#x27;ll know where I am and I can come out of it.&quot; After completing a series of aerial maneuvers, Locklear signaled that he would descend.

In front of spectators and film crew, Locklear and his long-time flying partner &quot;Skeets&quot; Elliot crashed heavily into the sludge pool of an oil well, never pulling out of the incipient spin. The crash resulted in a massive explosion and fire, with Locklear and Elliot dying instantly. After the accident, speculation revolved around the five arc lights that had remained fully on, possibly blinding the flight crew.

With the entire film already completed except for the night scene, Fox made the decision to capitalize on the fatal crash by rushing &quot;The Skywayman&quot; into post-production and release. With notices proclaiming &quot;Every Inch Of Film Showing Locklear&#x27;s Spectacular (And Fatal) Last Flight. His Death-Defying Feats And A Close Up Of His Spectacular Crash To Earth,&quot; the film premiered in Los Angeles on September 5, 1920. The advertising campaign that accompanied the film was very similar to that of Locklear&#x27;s first feature film, focusing on his earlier exploits and combining model displays and exhibition flights across North America to coincide with the film&#x27;s release. Upon the film&#x27;s release, Fox Film Corporation publicly announced that 10% of the profits would go to the families of Locklear and Elliot.

Locklear is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Fort Worth, Texas.

Locklear was reputed to be the prototype for the character of Waldo Pepper, played by Robert Redford in &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975). Viola Dana was an honored guest at the premiere of the film.
