<text>Dalian ( ) is a major sub-provincial port city in Liaoning province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, and is Liaoning&#x27;s second largest city (after the provincial capital Shenyang) and the third-most populous city of Northeast China (after Shenyang and Harbin). Located on the southern tip of the Liaodong peninsula, it is the southernmost city in both Liaoning and the entire Northeast. Dalian borders the prefectural cities of Yingkou and Anshan to the north and Dandong to the northeast, and also shares maritime boundaries with Qinhuangdao and Huludao across the Liaodong Bay to west and northwest, Yantai and Weihai on the Shandong peninsula across the Bohai Strait to the south, and North Korea across the Korea Bay to the east.

As of the 2020 census, its total population was 7,450,785 inhabitants whom 5,106,719 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of 6 out of 7 urban districts, Pulandian District not being conurbated yet.

Today, Dalian is a financial, shipping, and logistics center for East Asia. The city has a significant history of use by foreign powers for its ports. Dalian was previously known as &quot;Dalniy&quot; (; ), &quot;Dairen&quot; (), and &quot;Lüda&quot; or &quot;Luta&quot; (). The city used to be better known as &quot;Port Arthur&quot; and &quot;Ryojun&quot; () from the original Port Arthur, now the city&#x27;s Lüshunkou district.

In 2016, Dalian ranked 48th in the Global Financial Centres Index. In 2012, Dalian ranked 82nd in the Global City Competitiveness Index. In 2006, Dalian was named China&#x27;s most livable city by &quot;China Daily&quot;. It is now a &quot;Beta - Global City&quot; according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The large amount of port traffic makes Dalian a Large-Port Metropolis.

Dalian is one of the top 40 science cities in the world by scientific research as tracked by the Nature Index, ranking 37th globally in 2023. The city is home to several major universities, notably Dalian University of Technology and Dalian Maritime University, members of China&#x27;s prestigious universities in the Project 211, and the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

== Etymology ==
Modern Dalian originated from Qingniwa () or Qingniwaqiao (), a small Chinese fishing village. The Russian Empire built a commercial town after coercing a lease of the area from the Qing dynasty in 1898 and called it Dalny ( — &quot;a remote one&quot; or &quot;far-away&quot;, in reference to the town&#x27;s location,
rendered in Chinese as ) from 1898 to 1905. After the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Japan occupied the area as the Kwantung Leased Territory and renamed the city after the Chinese name for Dalian Bay () — a name in use since at least 1879. English-language sources called the city Dairen in this period (1905–1945), from Japanese.

In 1950, Dalian, back in Chinese control, merged with the nearby town called Lüshun (; formerly Ryojun and before that, Port Arthur) to form the city of Lüda (), a name (formed from the first syllable of each constituent&#x27;s name) which was usually rendered as Luta in English during that era. In 1981, the Chinese State Council again renamed the city from Lüda back to Dalian (), effective 5 March 1981.

==History==
===Ancient===
In the Qin and Han periods (221 BC – AD 220), the Chinese state expanded its territories into northern Korea through the Dalian region, then under the jurisdiction of Liaodong county. During the Sixteen Kingdoms era (3rd through 5th centuries), the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo controlled this region. In the early Tang dynasty (618–907), the Dalian region formed part of Andong Prefecture in Jili state; during the Liao dynasty (916–1125), it was a part of Dong Jing Tong Liaoyang county. Dalian was named Sanshan in the period of Wei Jin (220–420), San Shanpu in the Tang dynasty (618–907), Sanshan Seaport in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), and Qingniwakou during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).

===Qing dynasty===
In the 1880s, Jinzhou, the north of downtown Dalian, now Jinzhou District, was a walled town and a center for political intrigue and economic activity. The Qing government built bridges and heavily fortified the peninsula. Mining camps on the northern coast of Dalian Bay became the small town of Qingniwa () or Qingniwaqiao (), near what became the downtown core of modern-day Dalian.

===British, Russian, and Japanese occupations===


The British briefly occupied Qingniwa during the Second Opium War in 1858, but returned it to Chinese (Qing) control in 1860. Port Arthur at the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula took its English name from Royal Navy Lieutenant William Arthur, though the area&#x27;s Chinese name had always been Lüshun. Although China heavily fortified the area, in which it allowed trade with foreigners, in the First Sino-Japanese War Japan swiftly overcame those defenses on 21 November 1894 in the Battle of Lüshunkou, committing the Port Arthur massacre afterwards. In April 1895 China conceded defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, ceding Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan and Penghu, and making many other concessions in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (17 April 1895).

In the Triple Intervention of 23 April 1895, Russia, France and Germany forced Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula to China, despite the treaty&#x27;s terms; instead the Russian Empire coerced a lease of the peninsula from the Qing dynasty in 1898. Russia had a particular interest in the region of the peninsula as one of the few areas in the region that had the potential to develop ice-free ports. The Russians built a modern commercial port city, which they wanted to become the Paris of the Far East, and called it Dal&#x27;niy (). Linked by 1902 with the Trans-Siberian Railway via the branch line Chinese Eastern Railway through Harbin, Dal&#x27;niy became Russia&#x27;s primary port-city in Asia while also serving Western traders. Russia signed the Pavlov Agreement (1898) with China, which granted Russia a 25-year lease on Dalian and Lüshun and exclusive right to build a branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway—what would become from 1905 the Japanese-operated South Manchurian Railway. Russia spent more than 10 million golden rubles (equivalent to 11.5 billion of today&#x27;s rubles) building the new ice-free port city.

Russia heavily fortified both Dalniy (Qingniwaqiao of Zhongshan District) and the Port Arthur naval base (Lüshunkou) before and after the Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901. During the insurrection, missionaries and converts were killed by rebels in the peninsula, although the massive massacres of ethnic Chinese Christians including Metrophanes, Chi Sung occurred at Harbin. Western expeditionary forces suppressed the Boxers across the Yellow Sea in Shandong.

During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the Liaodong Peninsula became a major battleground. Major-General Baron Anatoly Stoessel defended a besieged Port Arthur, for five months (August 1904 to January 1905), but the Japanese army, using long-distance fire, sank several Russian ships at the Port Arthur naval base in early December 1904. Admiral Eugene Alexeyeff was blamed for splitting precious resources shipped across the single tracked Trans-Siberian Railway and Manchurian Railway between Dalniy and Port Arthur. After the Imperial Japanese Navy crippled the remaining Russian battleship &quot;Sevastopol&quot; in three weeks of constant attacks, and explosives detonated in tunnels destroyed Port Arthur&#x27;s remaining defenses in the final days of 1904, Russia negotiated a ceasefire and surrendered Port Arthur in January 1905.

The Treaty of Portsmouth (signed 5 September 1905) ceded Port Arthur to Japan, which set up the Kwantung Leased Territory or (), on roughly the southern half (Jinzhou District and south) of present-day Dalian. Japanese invested heavily in the region, which became the main trading port between Manchuria and Japan. Japan leased the area from Manchukuo after establishing that puppet state in 1932. In 1937, as the Second Sino-Japanese War began, Japan enlarged and modernized the trade zone as two cities: the northern Dairen (Dalian) and the southern Ryojun (Lüshun or Port Arthur).

===Post-World War II===

With the unconditional surrender of Japan in August–September 1945, Dairen passed to the Soviets, whose Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation had liberated the city on 22 August 1945. The Soviets and Chinese Communists cooperated to develop the city, relatively undamaged during the war, especially its industrial infrastructure and the port. The Soviet government rented the port and in 1945 the first Chinese Communist mayor of the new Lüda Administrative Office () was appointed.

In 1950 the USSR presented the city to the Chinese Communist government without any compensation. Dalian and Lüshun (former Port Arthur) merged as Lüda on 1 December 1950. From 12 March 1953 to 1 August 1954 it was a direct-controlled municipality and not part of Liaoning. Soviet troops left the city in 1955. After the Soviets left, the PRC made Lüda a major shipbuilding center.

In 1981 the city was renamed Dalian, with Lüshunkou becoming a constituent district. In 1984 the Chinese Government designated the city a Special Economic Zone. At the time, Dalian was China&#x27;s largest foreign-trade port.

=== 1990 to present ===
The city was upgraded from a prefecture-level city to a sub-provincial city in May 1994, with no change in its administrative subdivisions. In the 1990s the city benefited from the attention of Bo Xilai (later Party secretary of Chongqing). Bo served both as the mayor of the city and as one of the major leaders in the province; among other things, he banned motorcycles and planted large, lush parks in the city&#x27;s many traffic circles. He also preserved much of Dalian&#x27;s Japanese and Russian architectural heritage. He also worked as the former Minister of Commerce of China.

Since 2007 Dalian has hosted the Annual Meeting of the New Champions (&quot;Summer Davos&quot;), organized by the World Economic Forum, in alternating years with Tianjin. The venue for the forum is the Dalian International Conference Center in Donggang CBD. In 2008 about 1,000 people protested and blocked traffic as a response to the 2008 Tibetan anti-Chinese protests, and forced the temporary closure of the local Carrefour store.

In 2010 one of the worst recorded oil-spills in China&#x27;s history occurred in Dalian. The Dalian PX protest occurred on 14 August 2011. In June 2014, China&#x27;s tenth state-level new area, the Dalian Jinpu New Area was officially established. On 5 August 2016, the Dalian huabiao incident occurred. A huabiao in the center of Xinghai Square was demolished, which was believed to be out of political reasons related to the downfall of Chinese politician Bo Xilai, who oversaw the construction of Xinghai Square and the central huabiao during his tenure as the mayor of Dalian. The site of the huabiao was later replaced with a musical fountain, the largest one in Northeast China.

==Geography==
One of the most heavily developed industrial areas of China, Dalian municipal area today consists of Dalian proper and the smaller Lüshunkou (formerly Lüshun city, known in Western and Russian historic references as Port Arthur), farther along the Liaodong Peninsula. Historical references note that the Russian designed city of Dalniy (Alt. Dalney), on the south side of Dalian Bay was from Port Arthur/Lüshun (known today as Lüshunkou or literally, Lüshun Port).

Dalian is located on Korea Bay north of the Yellow Sea and roughly in the middle of the Liaodong peninsula at its narrowest neck or isthmus. With a coastline of , it governs the majority of the Liaodong Peninsula and about 260 surrounding islands and reefs. It is seated at south-south-west of the Yalu River, and its harbor entrance forms a sub-bay known as Dalian Bay.

===Climate===
Dalian has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;), characterized by warm wet summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Except for winter, the city experiences a one-month seasonal lag due to its position on the Liaodong Peninsula. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in August. Annual precipitation averages but is heavily concentrated in the summer months and can vary greatly from year to year. Due to the coastal location, the mean diurnal temperature variation annually is small, at . The monthly percent of possible sunshine ranges from 45% in July to 66% in March, with 2,625 hours of bright sunshine annually. The annual mean temperature is . Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 4 January 1970 to on 2 August 2018.

===Agriculture and aquaculture===
Dalian was originally an agriculture and aquaculture-based area, which, after the opening of the ferry between Yantai and Lüshun during the early 20th century, began to be populated by the farmers and fishers of Shandong, across the Yellow Sea during the Chuang Guandong era.

===Heavy, light and distribution industries===

Even before and during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the shipbuilding and locomotives industries were located in the city such as the companies which later became Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company and Dalian Locomotive &amp; Rolling Stock Works (DLoco). After the WWII, Dalian became an important center of the heavy and light industries, including companies such as Dalian Heavy Industry Co., Dalian Chemical Group, and Wafangdian Bearing Co.; and of the distribution industry, such as the Dashang Group.

Dalian Port is an important port for international trade. It has established trading and shipping links with more than 300 ports in 160 countries and regions of the world. There are over 100 international and domestic container shipping routes. A harbor for oil tankers (the largest by tonnage in China), at the terminus of an oil pipeline from the Daqing oilfields, was completed in 1976. Dalian is the 6th largest port in China; and according to AAPA world port ranking data, Dalian is the 8th busiest port in the world by cargo tonnage in 2012, and the 12th busiest container port in the world by total number of TEUs handled in 2013.

===Industrial zones===

Dalian has been given many benefits by the Chinese government, including the title of &quot;open-city&quot; (1984), which allows it to receive considerable foreign investment (see Special Economic Zone). The Development Zone was established in Jinzhou District, to which many Japanese companies, such as Canon, Mitsubishi Electric, Nidec, Sanyo Electric and Toshiba, followed by South Korean, American and European companies (such as Pfizer). In 2007, Intel announced plans to build a semiconductor fabrication facility (commonly known as a fab) in the Development Zone, Dalian. It is Intel&#x27;s first fab to be built at an entirely new site since 1992. The facility began operation in October 2010. Dalian also houses auto-manufacturing plants for Chery, Dongfeng Nissan Passenger Vehicle Company, and BYD Automobile (a production base for BYD K9 electric buses).

== Environment ==
=== Ecological conservation ===
Despite being in a period of economic and industrial growth, Dalian has placed an emphasis on environmental protection. Dalian&#x27;s ecological restoration and protection efforts are ongoing and expanding. In 2021, Dalian set a five-year-plan for the marine environment that included targets for conserving populations of the endangered black-faced spoonbill. In 2019, 49 nests were built for the black-faced spoonbill on nearby uninhabited islands. There has also been conservation and rescue efforts targeting spotted seal populations. Dalian also maintains the National Spotted Seal Nature Reserve within Lioadong Bay. This reserve is home to a spotted seal population and is a breeding ground for multiple marine species.

===Environmental issues===

In 2001, the United Nations Environment Programme awarded the Dalian Municipal Government for its outstanding contribution to the protection of the environment.

The average content of the four pollutants in the air reached Class II of National Ambient Air Quality Standards and there were 353 days with Air Pollution Index (API) over Class II (Good), including 108 excellent days with Class I (Superior). Dalian frequently ranks Grade 2 for air pollution according to State Environmental Protection Administration. However, the environmental effects of economic growth are of concern, according to Dalian Environmental Protection Agency, during the first half of 2011, respirable particles in the air increased significantly, with an average 40% higher than 2010.

The water quality of offshore marine space remained stable overall. The annual average content of monitoring indicators for water quality met Class-II of the National Seawater Quality Standard, with the exception of Inorganic Nitrogen in Dalian Bay and the city&#x27;s southern coast. The water quality of drinking water sources is considered good and complies with Class-III of Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water.Recent events have had a major environmental impact on the city. In July 2010, the explosion of two petroleum pipelines released 11,000 barrels of oil into the Yellow Sea, according to official statements. Rick Steiner, an American marine conservationist working with Greenpeace, says that the figure could be upwards of 400,000. It was reported as the largest oil spill to occur in China, and involved 2,000 firefighters. The oil spill stretched for at least . 800 fishing boats were mobilized for the cleanup. The incident caused President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao to intervene, and Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang moved in to help direct the rescue work. A researcher with the China Environmental Science Research Institute, said that &quot;the impact on marine life and on humans – as the pollution enters the food chain – could last 10 years.&quot; This has compounded aquatic pollution, affecting the city&#x27;s fishing industry.

In August 2011, a dike protecting the petrochemical Fujia Factory in Jinzhou District was breached due to a typhoon. Authorities have ordered the plant to be shut down. Around 12,000 residents protested as the factory, which originally was intended to be based in Xiamen, did not receive official approval to operate in Dalian. Municipal authorities ruled that the facility must move, leaving taxpayers to pay the expensive cost of relocation.

Concerns have been raised over mounting traffic due to &quot;bad urban design&quot; and that the growing rate of car ownership is affecting air quality. The United States National Academy of Engineering have raised concern about rising traffic in Dalian stating that &quot;rapid growth of traffic in Dalian and in similar Chinese cities will repeat the air quality and energy consumption mistakes of Los Angeles and other U.S. cities, if not better managed.&quot;

==Transportation==

===Local transportation===
Cycling is not as popular in Dalian as in other Chinese cities because of the hilly roads. Dalian is also one of the many cities in China where there are few motorcycles in the downtown core, where motorcycle riding is prohibited by the local law.

The city has a comprehensive bus system and an efficient metro system. As of March 2023, the Dalian Metro consists of the underground Line 1, Line 2, Line 5 and the overground Line 3, Line 12 and Line 13. New lines and expansion of the metro system are under way including Line 4 and Line 7. The new rail traffic system is designed to connect the entire city in the coming future. The Dalian Tram system is the second oldest in China. Most of the public transportation in the city can be accessed using the Mingzhu IC Card ().

===Domestic and international===

In 2005, Dalian expanded the international airport, Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport, with direct flights to the most major cities in China, and to cities in South Korea and Japan as well as countries in Southeast Asia. In 2014, the airport was the 20th busiest airport in China with 13,551,223 passengers. The airport is the hub of Dalian Airlines.

The new airport Dalian Jinzhouwan International Airport (IATA: DLC, ICAO: ZYTL) is also under way. Once open, it will replace the existing Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport as the city&#x27;s main airport. It is being built on 21 square kilometres (8.1 sq mi) of reclaimed land off the coast of Dalian. Expected to open in 2026, it is set to become the world&#x27;s largest offshore airport.

The city&#x27;s location means that train trips to most Chinese cities outside China&#x27;s northeastern region require changing trains in Beijing or Shanghai. With the high-speed rail system, trips from Dalian to Shenyang can be completed in 1.5 hours, to Changchun 2.5 hours and to Harbin 3.5 hours. The city has two major railway stations, namely Dalian railway station and Dalian North railway station, the latter being part of the Harbin–Dalian high-speed railway.

In addition to local and express bus services to Beijing and other areas in the northeast, Dalian is connected by passenger ship service to neighboring coastal cities, including Tianjin, Yantai, Weihai, Penglai and Dongying, as well as Incheon, South Korea.

==Culture==

In 2006, Dalian was selected as the most liveable city in China according to &quot;China Daily&quot;.

===Dalian dialect===

Dalian dialect belongs to the Jiaoliao Mandarin subgroup spoken in parts of Shandong and Liaoning provinces, which is a separate branch from Northeastern Mandarin. Most of the residents of Dalian were farmers and fishermen who had come from Shandong Province in a large population move, the &quot;Chuang Guandong&quot;, during which era Dalian was occupied by the Japanese as the Kwantung Leased Territory. Dalian dialect incorporates a few loanwords from Japanese and Russian (very rare in Chinese), reflecting the history of foreign occupation. Dalian dialect is mostly distinguishable from Standard Mandarin based on a low-falling Yinping (31) and rich tone sandhi, and it is often referred to as being &quot;oyster flavored&quot; () by the locals.

===Cuisine===
Dalian cuisine is a branch of Shandong cuisine, with influence from Northeastern Chinese cuisine, and is widely known for its unique style of seafood dishes. The variety of seafood in Dalian includes fish, prawns, clams, crabs, scallops, sea urchins, oysters, sea cucumbers, mussels, lobsters, conches, abalone, algae, razor clams, urechis unicinctus, mantis shrimps, jellyfish and so on. During the winter, many seafoods such as clams, mussels and abalone gain the most fat.

Colorful Snowflake Scallops () is a local seafood dish, where egg white is made into snowflake-shape to embrace the scallops, with seasonal greens, carrot and hot pepper cut into small pieces as decorations on top.

Another popular local dish is Salted Fish with Corn Cake (), where steamed or fried corn cake is served with fried salted fish. Legend goes that, in the old days fishermen going out fishing in the morning couldn&#x27;t return home to have lunch, so they baked fresh fish to eat with corn cakes, and the habit passed down from generation to generation and eventually became a famous food among local people.

Dalian-style Grilled Squid () is also a local delicacy. It originated in Dalian, where the squid is produced. It is made by frying the squid on an iron plate, then cutting the squid into sections with a spatula, and sprinkling it with special sauce.

Menzi () is a traditional local snack. A protein-rich starch paste coagulated from an extract of potatoes is cut into pieces and fried on a pan to create a crisp cover. A mixed seasoning of smashed garlic, sesame, and sauces is added on eating.

Other popular local specialties include seafood noodles, roast full prawns, salt baked conches, lantern-shaped steamed abalone, and so on.

===Theaters===

===Sports===

Dalian&#x27;s former football club, Dalian Shide (formerly known as Dalian Wanda as the club was originally sponsored by the Dalian Wanda Group), achieved a total of eight titles from China&#x27;s top-tier football league, the Chinese Jia-A League and the later rebranded Chinese Super League, and was widely considered one of the most successful clubs in Chinese football history. In the Asian Football Confederation, the club reached the 1997–98 Asian Club Championship and 2000–01 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals. Several of China&#x27;s greatest players, including Sun Jihai, Hao Haidong and Li Ming, made their names with Dalian Shide. Dalian also produced many top Chinese football players thanks to its youth training system and grassroots football culture. As of the 2014 season of the Chinese Super League, out of the 448 registered Chinese players, a total of 71 players are from Dalian. Therefore, Dalian earned its nickname of China&#x27;s &quot;Football City&quot; (), and a giant football statue was placed in the Labor Park near downtown Dalian in its honor. Current football clubs in the city are Dalian Pro playing in the Chinese Super League and Dalian Pro W.F.C. playing in the Chinese Women&#x27;s Football League. Both of their home stadiums are the Dalian Sports Centre Stadium.

In February 2018, Dalian Wanda Group decided to take over Dalian Pro (then Dalian Yifang), after a lapse of 20 years before Wanda Group decided to reinvest in a Dalianese football club.

<doc id="250118" wikidata="Q964210" url="?curid=250118" title="François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé">
<text>François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé (19 November 1739 – 14 November 1800) was a French general and colonial administrator. After distinguishing himself in the Seven Years&#x27; War, he was appointed governor of Guadeloupe in 1768. A well-loved administrator, he authored the popular song &quot;Les adieux d&#x27;une créole&quot;.His most well-known military exploits took place in the West Indies during the American War of Independence, where he was involved in the French capture of a number of British possessions. Following that war he returned to France, where he held military commands in the country&#x27;s northeast at the time of the French Revolution. A committed Royalist, he was a leading conspirator involved in the royal family&#x27;s failed flight in 1791, whose failure forced Bouillé into exile. He continued to be active in consultative roles to members of the First Coalition, which opposed the forces of Revolutionary France in the early years of the French Revolutionary War. He died in exile in London, and is mentioned as a hated Royalist in the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;.

==Early life==
François Claude Amour, the marquis de Bouillé was born at Chateau Cluzel in Saint-Èble (present-day Mazeyrat-d&#x27;Allier, Haute-Loire) on 19 November 1739. His mother died shortly after his birth, and his father died a few years later. He was raised by a paternal uncle who was also First Almoner to King Louis XV. He was educated in a Jesuit school, and at age 16 his uncle purchased for him a commission in a company of dragoons of the French Army.

Bouillé first saw military action in the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1758, when his regiment joined French forces in present-day Germany. He distinguished himself throughout the campaign, playing an important role in the Battle of Grünberg in February 1761 that resulted in the surrender of thousands of German troops and the capture of many military standards, and prompted Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick to lift that year&#x27;s Siege of Cassel. Bouillé was given the honour of taking the captured standards to Paris to present them to the King. He was recognized with a brevet promotion to colonel, and was given command of the next regiment that became available.

==West Indies and the American War of Independence==
In 1768 Bouillé was appointed governor of the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, where he again distinguished himself. The Comte d&#x27;Emery, governor general of the French West Indies, was so impressed with Bouillé that he recommended to the King that Bouillé succeed him at the post. When d&#x27;Emery died in 1777, Bouillé was awarded with the governorships of Martinique and St. Lucia, with authority to take full command of the French West Indies in the event France joined the American War of Independence.

France&#x27;s entry into that war occurred in early 1778, and Bouillé was heavily involved in the planning, execution, and leadership of operations in the West Indies. He organized and led the capture of Dominica before the British there were even aware of the war declaration, and was involved in organizing, provisioning, and leading troops in a number of other actions. In 1782 he recaptured Dutch Sint Eustatius, which the British had captured just the year before, and was involved in that year planning with Bernardo de Gálvez a Franco-Spanish expedition against Jamaica. The expedition was called off after the disastrous French defeat at the naval Battle of the Saintes in April 1782.

Bouillé returned to France in 1783 after the peace. King Louis rewarded him for his conduct in the war with the Order of the Holy Spirit. He traveled the following year to England, where he was well received. He was well respected by the British for his treatment of prisoners of war and other captives during the war. In one notable instance, he returned the crew of a shipwrecked British frigate to a nearby British possession, refusing to take advantage of their plight to make them prisoners of war. He was equally gracious at home, even refusing an offer of payment (amounting to the munificent sum equivalent to £20,000 of the day) from the King for war expenses that he had personally covered.

==French Revolution==
In 1787 Bouillé was named governor of the Three Bishoprics. He served in 1787 and 1788 in the Assemblies of Notables called by King Louis in an attempt to deal with France&#x27;s perilous financial state.

After the French Revolution began in 1789, Bouillé retained control of the Three Bishoprics, and was also given military command of Alsace and Franche-Comté in 1790. A committed Royalist, he was instrumental in putting down rebellion in Metz, and led forces that controversially crushed a military mutiny in the &quot;Nancy affair&quot; in August 1790, in which both soldiers and civilians were killed. Although the National Assembly approved his actions, radicals were critical of the severity of his response.

===Louis&#x27; failed flight===

Bouillé had managed to keep a fairly strong Royalist command in his army, and he became deeply involved in an attempt by King Louis and Marie Antoinette to escape their virtual house arrest in Paris. In conjunction with Comte Axel von Fersen and Baron de Breteuil, he planned the means and route by which the Royal Family would travel from Paris to the fortress of Montmédy, within Bouillé&#x27;s area of control. Approximately 10,000 regulars of the old royal army were encamped at or near Montmedy. The regiments, which included Swiss and German mercenary units, made up a force that had largely retained its discipline and was considered by the court party as still loyal to the monarchy. Historians continue to debate how the flight led to the royals&#x27; arrest at Varennes.

Bouillé&#x27;s son Louis was sent to Paris to inform the royal family of the plans and possible safe points. Bouillé also made specific suggestions about the route and the travel arrangements. He recommended a different route from the one which Louis ultimately chose, and he suggested that they not travel in a single coach, instead splitting up so that they would draw less attention en route. That advice also was not taken. Bouillé was to provide troops to protect the royal party on the final stages of the journey through the area that he controlled. Some of the units considered more reliable by the royalist high command had, however, recently been reassigned to other commands, and in a time of wide social unrest, he could not fully trust all of the troops that remained. Cavalry detachments were placed in towns along the route, citing as a pretext the expected delivery of treasury funds going to Paris. The sudden arrival of the dragoons and hussars, however, drew immediate attention and suspicion. This heightened tension in the local population may have played a role in the ultimate capture and arrest at Varennes. Delays in the arrival of the coach carrying the royal family had led to several of Bouillé&#x27;s detachments being stood down, and none was immediately available to intervene.

===Aftermath===
As an immediate result of the forced return of the royal family to Paris, Bouillé and senior members of his staff fled France to join the Austro-Prussian forces assembled beyond the border. He subsequently issued a proclamation threatening reprisals if any harm was done to the king. This only served to further discredit the weakened monarchy.

The failure of the attempted flight set off a wave of recriminations among the Royalist conspirators. The duc de Choiseul and Bouillé both wrote memoirs (Bouillé in 1800, the year of his death), seeking to defend their actions during the flight, and to assign blame to others.

===Exile===
Bouillé went into exile, first travelling to Pillnitz, where the spread of anti-Royalist sentiments was discussed by other European monarchs. Courted by royalty for positions in their armies, he sought to remain loyal to Louis, eventually serving as a military consultant to Prussian King Frederick William II in the early stages of the First Coalition. He joined military campaigns in 1793, and was urged to take command of Royalist forces in the Vendée, but refused, believing the forces would ultimately fail in their aims. Shortly after that, he sailed for England, where he continued to assist the British in military activities against Revolutionary France.

In 1797 Bouillé published his memoirs, which were a great success. He died in London on 14 November 1800 and was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church. In 1866, his remains were reinterred at the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris.

==Legacy==
During Bouillé&#x27;s years of exile, the German author Franz Alexander von Kleist left a character sketch of Bouillé in his &quot;Fantasien auf einer Reise nach Prag&quot; (1792) after seeing him with his son at a performance of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Estates Theatre in Prague on 2 September 1791. Kleist described Bouillé as a broken man wracked with worry and remorse over the actions that sent him into exile and made him vilified in France.

The first version (1769) of the words of the Caribbean song &quot;&quot; are attributed to him.

Bouillé&#x27;s role in the French Revolution is alluded to in the fifth stanza of the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, as a detestable counter-revolutionary figure:

==Marriage and issue==

On 6 July 1768, Bouillé was married to Marie Louise Guillemette de Bègue (1746–1803), a daughter of Marie Anne Neau Dubreuil and Pierre Joseph de Bègue, a former Major of Martinique. Together, they were the parents of:

* Louis Joseph Amour de Bouillé (1769–1850), who married Marie Robertine Anne Hélène Joséphine Walsh de Serrant.
* François Guillaume Antoine de Bouillé (1770–1837), who married Antoinette de Jorna.
* Cécile Emilie Céleste Eléonore de Bouillé (1774–1801), who married François-Jules de Contades, Vicomte de Contades.

<doc id="250122" wikidata="Q350202" url="?curid=250122" title="Erik Eriksson">
<text>Erik Eriksson (; 1216 – 2 February 1250), sometimes known as Erik XI or with the epithet the Lisp and Lame (), was King of Sweden from 1222 to 1229 and again from 1234 to 1250. Being the last ruler of the House of Erik, he stood in the shadow of a succession of powerful jarls, especially his brother-in-law Birger Jarl, whose descendants ruled as kings after his death.

==Background==
Erik was the son of King Erik Knutsson and Rikissa of Denmark. According to &quot;Erik&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; (), written in the early 1320s, Erik is said to have been partly lame; &quot;King Erik lisped somewhat when talking / and displayed a limp when walking&quot;. For this reason, later historians referred to him as &quot;Erik the Lisp and Lame&quot; which was apparently not used in his own time. Erik was born after his father had already died (1216). The fifteen-year-old Johan Sverkersson from the rival House of Sverker was hailed king by the Swedish aristocracy, while Queen Rikissa returned to her Danish homeland where her brother Valdemar Sejr ruled.

Erik spent his early youth in Denmark, while Valdemar championed his rights to the Swedish throne and tried to prevent the coronation of Johan. Pope Honorius III ordered three North German bishops to investigate the issue in 1219, however to no avail. Johan nevertheless died in 1222, whereby the House of Sverker became extinct in the male line.

==First reign==

With no dynastic rivals at hand, the six-year-old Erik was hailed as king, sometime between August 1222 and July 1223. Archbishop supported his cause and appears to have crowned him in Strängnäs Cathedral on 31 July 1223. During the minority of the king, a council was formed, consisting of Bishop Bengt of Skara, the king&#x27;s foster father Erengisle Vig, Stenar, Knut Kristinesson, and Knut Långe (Knut Holmgersson). The two last-mentioned were second cousins of King Erik. In 1225, Erik and his realm were taken under the protection of the Pope. In the same year a brief conflict with Norway flared up, as King Håkon Håkonson made an incursion into Värmland in retaliation for support given to Håkon&#x27;s Norwegian enemies. The members of the royal council were termed (), a term that now occurs for the first time in a Swedish context. However, the internal cohesion of the council was weak, and its members were considered notoriously unreliable. Knut Kristinesson went to Norway in 1226 in order to claim the crown of this country, and Bishop Bengt died in 1228.

In 1229, a feud broke out, as Knut the Tall and a party of nobles, the Folkung Party, rose against the young ruler. The causes are not known, but a wish by some nobles to restrain the power of the Church might have had a role. Erik was overthrown after the Battle of Olustra in 1230. The battle is believed to have taken place in Olustra (Ostra) in Södermanland, although Alvastra in Östergötland has been mentioned as a possible site. After his loss, the young king fled to Denmark where his uncle Valdemar Sejr was still ruling. Knut Långe was crowned King of Sweden in 1231, but his time was short and he died in 1234, which prompted Erik to return to the throne.

==Second reign==
According to a Danish source, Erik returned to Sweden already in 1232, when Knut was still king. The Swedish on the contrary asserts that he came back after King Knut&#x27;s death, after a new round of fighting; however, this is not recorded in any other source. At any rate Erik was once again accepted as king and ruled until his own death in 1250. At first, he reconciled with the Folkung Party. The Folkung Ulf Fase, who had been Jarl of the realm under Knut Långe, continued to serve in that function under Erik. Ulf Fase was an able politician who managed to prevent feuding between the noble factions for many years. As a king, Erik is depicted in as good-natured but physically passive:

In fact, he was relatively insignificant and heavily dependent on stronger men in his entourage; first Ulf Fase and, after his death (1248), the latter&#x27;s kinsman Birger Magnusson (better known as Birger Jarl; ). They were both scions of the large and influential Bjälbo family from Östergötland, but entertained different political agendas. While Ulf pursued a policy of alliance with the Norwegian king, Birger strove to strengthen royal authority by allying closely with the Catholic Church. In about the late 1230s, King Erik&#x27;s elder sister Ingeborg was married to Birger, in the latter&#x27;s first marriage. Birger was purportedly the son of a female heiress of the Sverker dynasty, thus having royal blood. It is possible that multiple jarls co-existed during his reign, as Birger Jarl is referred to as &quot;dux&quot; in 1247; however, whether this is a mistake, or if Ulf governed Svealand while Birger governed Östergötland, is not known.

==Eastward expansion==

Sweden had a certain presence in southwest Finland by the early 13th century, although it is unclear to what extent this translated into political power. A bishopric existed in Nousiainen and later Turku (), which stood under the papal legate of the Baltic region. The contains a graphic description of a military expedition to Tavastia () further to the east that King Erik dispatched in an unspecified year, possibly in 1238–39 or 1249–50. The professed aim was to Christianize the pagan lands. A sizable fleet was assembled under the leadership of Birger and sailed over to Tavastia (a problematic statement since Tavastia is an inland region). According to the highly propagandist chronicle, the expedition was an unqualified success:

The expedition led to the establishment of a permanent fortress, Tavasteborg, and the formal Christianization of the region. As the chronicle has it, &quot;I think the Russian king feels its loss&quot;. The enterprise is not mentioned in other sources, and its circumstances are hotly debated among modern historians. It is possibly connected to a Swedish foray in the Novgorod Republic in 1240. A fleet of ships commanded by a certain Spiridon and accompanied by a few bishops went up the Neva River, but were attacked and routed by the Novgorodian prince Alexander Nevsky. Details of the battle are partly legendary, and its significance might have been exaggerated in Russian historiography. According to a 14th-century source, the Swedish leader was a Belgerd, corresponding to Birger, though this may be a later construction.

==Renewed domestic feuding==
Internal fighting once again broke out in 1247, shortly before (or possibly after) Ulf Fase&#x27;s death. The Folkung Party warred with King Erik and Birger, but their peasant allies in Uppland lost the Battle of Sparrsätra and were punished by tightening royal taxation. The Folkung leader Holmger Knutsson, a son of Knut Långe, fled to Gästrikland but was captured by Erik&#x27;s men and beheaded.

Shortly after the defeat of the uprising, Birger was appointed Jarl of the realm. As such he oversaw a clerical meeting in Skänninge in February 1248, summoned by the papal legate William of Sabina. On behalf of Pope Innocent IV, he urged the Swedes to stick to canonic-juridical praxis as laid down by Rome. The authority of the bishops was strengthened and Sweden was increasingly incorporated in the Catholic Church.

==Family and heirs==

Erik married Queen Catherine in 1243 or 1244. She was the daughter of Jarl Sune Folkesson of Bjälbo and an heiress of the House of Sverker. In that way the two long-competing royal houses were eventually united. Commonly, sources say that Erik was childless, but some sources claim that he had a couple of baby daughters who died.

Erik Eriksson died on 2 February 1250, and was buried in the monastery of Varnhem Abbey in Västergötland. With him the House of Erik became extinct in the male line, with the possible exception of Knut Långe&#x27;s son Filip (). Under these circumstances the throne went to the offspring of Birger Jarl and Ingeborg, the more since Birger was now in full control over the realm. Their eldest but still under-age son Valdemar was elected king in 1250 to succeed Erik, possibly by-passing the sons, to the extent there were such, of Ingeborg&#x27;s elder sisters. Birger Jarl became the Regent, holding the true power in Sweden until his own death in 1266. &quot;Skáldatal&quot; reports that Óláfr Þórðarson was one of Erik&#x27;s court skalds.

<text>The Antilles is an archipelago bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the south and west, the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and the Atlantic Ocean to the north and east.

The Antillean islands are divided into two smaller groupings: the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. The Greater Antilles includes the Cayman Islands and larger islands of Cuba, Hispaniola (subdivided into the nations of the Dominican Republic and Haiti) and Navassa Island, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The Lesser Antilles contains the northerly Leeward Islands and the southeasterly Windward Islands as well as the Leeward Antilles just north of Venezuela. The Lucayan Archipelago (consisting of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands), though a part of the West Indies, is generally not included among the Antillean islands.

Geographically, the Antillean islands are generally considered a subregion of North America. Culturally speaking, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico – and sometimes the whole of the Antilles – are included in Latin America, although some sources use the phrase &quot;Latin America and the Caribbean&quot; instead (see Latin America, &quot;In Contemporary Usage&quot;).

In terms of geology, the Greater Antilles are mostly made up of continental rock accreted on the North American Plate from relative movement of the Caribbean Plate. The Lesser Antilles are mostly young volcanic islands created by the Lesser Antilles subduction zone.

== Background ==
The word &quot;Antilles&quot; originated in the period before the European colonization of the Americas, &quot;Antilia&quot; being one of those mysterious lands which figured on the medieval charts, sometimes as an archipelago, sometimes as continuous land of greater or lesser extent, its location fluctuating in mid-ocean between the Canary Islands and India.

After the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s expedition in what was later called the West Indies, the European powers realized that the dispersed lands constituted an extensive archipelago in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The Antilles were called multiple names before their current name became the norm. Early Spanish visitors called them the &quot;Windward Islands&quot; (today having a narrower definition). They were also called the &quot;Forward Islands&quot; by 18th-century British. Thereafter, the term &quot;Antilles&quot; was commonly assigned to the formation, and &quot;Sea of the Antilles&quot; became a common alternative name for the Caribbean Sea in various European languages.

Lying in the center of the Songliao Plain, Changchun is administered as a , comprising 7 districts, 1 county and 3 county-level cities. According to the 2020 census of China, Changchun had a total population of 9,066,906 under its jurisdiction. The city&#x27;s metro area, comprising 5 districts and 1 development area, had a population of 5,019,477 in 2020, as the Shuangyang and Jiutai districts are not urbanized yet. It is one of the biggest cities in Northeast China, along with Shenyang, Dalian and Harbin.

The name of the city means &quot;long spring&quot; in Chinese. Between 1932 and 1945, Changchun was renamed Xinjing () or Hsinking by the Kwantung Army as it became the capital of the Imperial Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, occupying modern Northeast China. After the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Changchun was established as the provincial capital of Jilin in 1954.

Known locally as China&#x27;s &quot;City of Automobiles&quot;, Changchun is an important industrial base with a particular focus on the automotive sector. Because of its key role in the domestic automobile industry, Changchun was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Detroit of China.&quot; Apart from this industrial aspect, Changchun is also one of four &quot;National Garden Cities&quot; awarded by the Ministry of Construction of P.R. China in 2001 due to its high urban greening rate.

Changchun is also one of the top 30 cities in the world by scientific research as tracked by the Nature Index according to the Nature Index 2024 Science Cities. The city is home to several major universities, notably Jilin University and Northeast Normal University, members of China&#x27;s prestigious universities in the Double First-Class Construction.

==History==

===Early history===
Changchun was initially established on imperial decree as a small trading post and frontier village during the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor in the Qing dynasty. Trading activities mainly involved furs and other natural products during this period. In 1800, the Jiaqing Emperor selected a small village on the east bank of the Yitong River and named it &quot;Changchun Ting&quot;.

At the end of the 18th century peasants from overpopulated provinces such as Shandong and Hebei began to settle in the region. In 1889, the village was promoted into a city known as &quot;Changchun Fu&quot;.

===Railway era===
In May 1898, Changchun got its first railway station, located in Kuancheng, part of the railway from Harbin to Lüshun (the southern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway), constructed by the Russian Empire.
After Russia&#x27;s loss of the southernmost section of this branch as a result of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the Kuancheng station (Kuanchengtze, in contemporary spelling) became the last Russian station on this branch. The next station just a short distance to the south—the new &quot;Japanese&quot; Changchun station—became the first station of the South Manchuria Railway, which now owned all the tracks running farther south, to Lüshun, which they re-gauged to the standard gauge (after a short period of using the narrow Japanese gauge during the war).

A special Russo-Japanese agreement of 1907 provided that Russian gauge tracks would continue from the &quot;Russian&quot; Kuancheng Station to the &quot;Japanese&quot; Changchun Station, and vice versa, tracks on the &quot;gauge adapted by the South Manchuria Railway&quot; (i.e. the standard gauge) would continue from Changchun Station to Kuancheng Station.

An epidemic of pneumonic plague occurred in surrounding Manchuria from 1910 to 1911, known as the Manchurian plague. It was the worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague which was spread through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. This turned out to be the beginning of the large pneumonic plague pandemic of Manchuria and Mongolia which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims.

===City planning and development from 1906 to 1931===
The Treaty of Portsmouth formally ended the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and saw the transfer and assignment to the Empire of Japan in 1906 the railway between Changchun and Port Arthur, and all its branches.

Having realized the strategic importance of Changchun&#x27;s location with respect to Japan, China and Russia, the Japanese Government sent a group of planners and engineers to Changchun to determine the best site for a new railway station.

Without the consent of the Chinese Government, Japan purchased or seized from local farmers the land on which the Changchun Railway Station was to be constructed as the centre of the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Areas (SMRAA). In order to turn Changchun into the centre for extracting the agricultural and mineral resources of Manchuria, Japan developed a blueprint for Changchun and invested heavily in the construction of the city.

At the beginning of 1907, as the prelude to, and preparation for, the invasion and occupation of China, Japan initiated the planning programme of the SMRAA, which embodied distinctive colonial characteristics. The guiding ideology of the overall design was to build a high standard colonial city with sophisticated facilities, multiple functions and a large scale.

Accordingly, nearly ¥7 million on average was allocated on a year-by-year basis for urban planning and construction during the period 1907 to 1931.

The comprehensive plan was to ensure the comfort required by Japanese employees on Manchurian Railways, build up Changchun into a base for Japanese control of the whole Manchuria in order to provide an effective counterweight to Russia in this area of China.

The city&#x27;s role as a rail hub was underlined in its planning and construction, the main design concepts of which read as follows: under conventional grid pattern terms, two geoplagiotropic boulevards were newly carved eastward and westward from the grand square of the new railway station. The two helped form two intersections with the gridded prototypes, which led to two circles of South and West. The two sub-civic centres served as axes on which eight radial roads were blazed that took the shape of a sectoral structure.

At that time, the radial circles and the design concept of urban roads were quite advanced and scientific. It activated to great extent the serious urban landscapes as well as clearly identifying the traditional gridded pattern.

With the new Changchun railway station as its centre, the urban plan divided the SMRAA into various specified areas: residential quarters 15%, commerce 33%, grain depot 19%, factories 12%, public entertainment 9%, and administrative organs (including a Japanese garrison) 12%. Each block provided the railway station with supporting and systematic services dependent on its own functions.

In the meantime, a comprehensive system of judiciary and military police was established which was totally independent of China. That accounted for the widespread nature of military facilities within the urban construction area of , such as the railway garrison, the gendarmerie and the police department, with its 18 local police stations.

Perceiving Changchun as a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; upon which to construct new and sweeping conceptions of the built environment, the Japanese used the city as a practical laboratory to create two distinct and idealized urban milieus, each appropriate to a particular era. From 1906 to 1931, Changchun served as a key railway town through which the Japanese orchestrated an informal empire. Between 1932 and 1945, the city became home to a grandiose new Asian capital. Yet, while the façades in the city and later the capital contrasted markedly, along with the attitudes of the state they upheld, the shifting styles of planning and architecture consistently attempted to represent Japanese rule as progressive, beneficent, and modern.

The development of Changchun, in addition to being driven by the railway system, suggested an important period of the Northeast modern architectural culture, reflecting Japanese urban design endeavours and revealing that county&#x27;s ambition to invade and occupy China. Japanese architecture and culture had been widely applied to Manchukuo to highlight the special status of the Japanese puppet. Urban planning clearly stems from a culture, be it aggressive or creative. Changchun&#x27;s planning and construction process serves as a good example.

Changchun expanded rapidly as the junction between of the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railway and the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway, remaining the break of gauge point between the Russian and standard gauges into the 1930s,

===Manchukuo and World War II===
On 10 March 1932 the capital of Manchukuo, a Japan-controlled puppet state in Manchuria, was established in Changchun. The city was then renamed Hsinking (; Japanese:; literally &quot;New Capital&quot;) on 13 March. The Emperor Puyi resided in the Imperial Palace () which is now the Museum of the Manchu State Imperial Palace. During the Manchukuo period, the region experienced harsh suppression, brutal warfare on the civilian population, forced conscription and labor and other Japanese sponsored government brutalities; at the same time a rapid industrialisation and militarisation took place. Hsinking was a well-planned city with broad avenues and modern public works. The city underwent rapid expansion in both its economy and infrastructure. Many of buildings built during the Japanese colonial era still stand today, including those of the Eight Major Bureaus of Manchukuo () as well as the Headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army.
====Construction of Hsinking====
Hsinking was the only Direct-controlled municipality () in Manchukuo after Harbin was incorporated into the jurisdiction of Binjiang Province. In March 1932, the Inspection Division of South Manchuria Railway started to draw up the Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking (). The Bureau of capital construction () which was directly under the control of State Council of Manchukuo was established to take complete responsibility of the formulation and the implementation of the plan. Kuniaki Koiso, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and Yasuji Okamura, the Vice Chief-of-Staff, finalized the plan of a construction area. The Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking was influenced by the renovation plan of Paris in the 19th century, the garden city movement, and theories of American cities&#x27; planning and design in the 1920s. The city development plan included extensive tree planting. By 1934 Hsinking was known as &quot;the Forest Capital&quot; with Jingyuetan Park built, which is now China&#x27;s largest Plantation and a AAAA-rated recreational area.

In accordance with the Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking, the area of publicly shared land (including the Imperial Palace, government offices, roads, parks and athletic grounds) in Hsinking was , whilst the area of residential, commercial and industrial developments was planned to be . However, Hsinking&#x27;s population exceeded the prediction of 500,000 by 1940. In 1941, the Capital Construction Bureau modified the original plan, which expanded the urban area to . The new plan also focused on the construction of satellite towns around the city with a planning of land per capita. Because the effects of war, the Metropolitan Plan of Great Hsinking remained unfinished. By 1944, the built up urban area of Hsinking reached , while the area used for greening reached . As Hsinking&#x27;s city orientation was the administrative center and military commanding center, land for military use exceeded the originally planned figure of 9 percent, while only light manufacturing including packing industry, cigarette industry and paper-making had been developed during this period. Japanese force also controlled Hsinking&#x27;s police system, instead of Manchukuo government. Major officers of Hsinking police were all ethnic Japanese.

The population of Hsinking also experienced rapid growth after being established as the capital of Manchukuo. According to the census in 1934 taken by the police agency, the city&#x27;s municipal area had 141,712 inhabitants. By 1944 the city&#x27;s population had risen to 863,607, with 153,614 Japanese settlers. This population made Hsinking the third largest metropolitan city in Manchukuo after Mukden and Harbin, as the metropolitan mainly focused on military and political function.

====Japanese chemical warfare agents====
In 1936, the Imperial Japanese Army established Unit 100 to develop plague biological weapons, although the declared purpose of Unit 100 was to conduct research about diseases originating from animals. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and World War II the headquarters of Unit 100 (&quot;Wakamatsu Unit&quot;) was located in downtown Hsinking, under command of veterinarian Yujiro Wakamatsu. This facility was involved in research of animal vaccines to protect Japanese resources, and, especially, biological-warfare. Diseases were tested for use against Soviet and Chinese horses and other livestock. In addition to these tests, Unit 100 ran a bacteria factory to produce the pathogens needed by other units. Biological sabotage testing was also handled at this facility: everything from poisons to chemical crop destruction.

===Siege of Changchun===

On 20 August 1945 the city was captured by the Soviet Red Army and renamed Changchun. The Russians maintained a presence in the city during the Soviet occupation of Manchuria until 1946.

National Revolutionary Army forces under Zheng Dongguo occupied the city in 1946, but were unable to hold the countryside against Lin Biao&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army forces during the Chinese Civil War. The city fell to the Chinese Communist Party in 1948 after the five-month Siege of Changchun, and the communist victory was a turning point which allowed an offensive to capture the remainder of Mainland China. Between 10 and 30 percent of the civilian population starved to death under the siege; estimates range from 150,000 to 330,000. the PRC government avoids all mention of the siege.

===People&#x27;s Republic===
Renamed Changchun by the People&#x27;s Republic of China government, it became the capital of Jilin in 1954. The Changchun Film Studio is also one of the remaining film studios of the era. Changchun Film Festival has become a unique gala for film industries since 1992.

From the 1950s, Changchun was designated to become a center for China&#x27;s automotive industry. Construction of the First Automobile Works (FAW) began in 1953 and production of the Jiefang CA-10 truck, based on the Soviet ZIS-150 started in 1956. The Soviet Union lent assistance during these early years, providing technical support, tooling, and production machinery. In 1958, FAW introduced the famous Hongqi (Red Flag) limousines This series of cars are billed as &quot;the official car for minister-level officials&quot;.

<doc id="250127" wikidata="Q437335" url="?curid=250127" title="George Adamski">
<text>George Adamski (17 April 1891 – 23 April 1965) was a Polish-American author who became widely known in ufology circles, and to some degree in popular culture, after he displayed numerous photographs in the 1940s and 1950s that he said were of alien spacecraft, claimed to have met with friendly Nordic alien Space Brothers, and claimed to have taken flights with them to the Moon and other planets.

Adamski was the first, and most famous, of several so-called UFO contactees who came to prominence during the 1950s. Adamski called himself a &quot;philosopher, teacher, student and saucer researcher&quot;, although most UFO researchers and investigators regarded him as a charlatan and a con artist and concluded that his many claims were an elaborate hoax.

Adamski authored three books describing his meetings with Nordic aliens and his travels with them aboard their spaceships: &quot;Flying Saucers Have Landed&quot; (co-written with Desmond Leslie) in 1953, &quot;Inside the Space Ships&quot; in 1955, and &quot;Flying Saucers Farewell&quot; in 1961. The first two books were both bestsellers; by 1960 they had sold a combined 200,000 copies. In addition to his contributions to ufology in the United States, Adamski&#x27;s work became popular in other countries, especially Japan and helped inspire many depictions of aliens and UFOs in postwar Japanese culture and media.

==Early years==
Adamski was born in Bromberg in the Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire. He was one of five siblings born to ethnic Polish parents, Józef Adamski (1867–1937) and Franciszka Adamska (1862–1946).

When Adamski was two years old his family emigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. From 1913 to 1916, beginning at the age of 22, he was a soldier in the 13th U.S. Cavalry Regiment (K Troop) fighting at the Mexican border during the Pancho Villa Expedition.

In 1917, Adamski married Mary Shimbersky. She died in 1954, they had no children. Following his marriage Adamski moved west, doing maintenance work in Yellowstone National Park and working in an Oregon flour mill and a California concrete factory. In the 1920s, Adamski became interested in the esoteric occultist religion Theosophy, and a variant called Neo-Theosophy. By 1930, &quot;Adamski was a minor figure on the California occult scene&quot;, teaching his personal mixture of Christianity and Eastern religions, which he called &quot;Universal Progressive Christianity&quot; and &quot;Universal Law.&quot;

In the early 1930s, while living in Southern California, Adamski founded the &quot;Royal Order of Tibet&quot; in Laguna Beach, which held its meetings in the &quot;Temple of Scientific Philosophy&quot;. Adamski served as a &quot;philosopher&quot; and teacher at the temple. The &quot;Royal Order of Tibet&quot; was given a government license to make wine for &quot;religious purposes&quot; during Prohibition; Adamski was quoted as saying &quot;I made enough wine for all of Southern California ... I was making a fortune!&quot; However, the end of Prohibition in December 1933 also marked the decline of his profitable wine-making business, and Adamski later told two friends that&#x27;s when he &quot;had to get into this [flying] saucer crap.&quot;

In 1940, Adamski, his wife, and some close friends moved to a ranch near California&#x27;s Palomar Mountain, where they dedicated their time to studying religion, philosophy, and farming. In 1944, with funding from Alice K. Wells, a student of Adamski, they purchased of land at the base of Palomar Mountain, along highway S6, where they built a new home, a campground called Palomar Gardens, and a small diner called Palomar Gardens Cafe.

At the campground and diner, Adamski &quot;often gave lectures on Eastern philosophy and religion, sometimes late into the night&quot; to students, admirers, and tourists. He also built a wooden observatory at the campground to house his six-inch telescope, and visitors and tourists to Palomar Mountain often received the false impression that Adamski was an astronomer connected to the famed Palomar Observatory at the top of the mountain. Adamski usually did nothing to correct this inaccurate impression; he would tell visitors the truth &quot;only when pressed to do so.&quot; Though he was usually referred to as &quot;Professor&quot; Adamski by his admirers and followers and he often implied or claimed to possess various academic degrees, Adamski held no graduate or undergraduate degree from any accredited college or university and in fact had only a third grade education.

==Ufology==
On 9 October 1946, during a meteor shower, Adamski and some friends claimed that while they were at the Palomar Gardens campground, they witnessed a large cigar-shaped &quot;mother ship.&quot; In early 1947, Adamski took a photograph of what he claimed was the 1946 cigar-shaped &quot;mother ship&quot; crossing in front of the Moon over Palomar Gardens. In the summer of 1947, following the first widely publicized UFO sightings in the US, Adamski claimed he had seen 184 UFOs pass over Palomar Gardens one evening.

In 1949, Adamski began giving his first UFO lectures to civic groups and other organizations in Southern California; he requested, and received, fees for the lectures. In these lectures he made &quot;fantastic&quot; claims, such as &quot;that government and science had established the existence of UFOs two years earlier, via radar tracking of 700-foot-long spacecraft on the other side of the Moon.&quot; In his lectures, Adamski further claimed that &quot;science now knows that all planets [in Earth&#x27;s solar system] are inhabited&quot; and &quot;photos of Mars taken from the Mount Palomar observatory have proven the canals on Mars are man-made, built by an intelligence far greater than any man&#x27;s on earth.&quot;

However, as one UFO historian has noted, &quot;even in the early 1950s [Adamski&#x27;s] assertions about surface conditions on, and the habitability of, Venus, Mars, and the other planets of the solar system flew in the face of massive scientific evidence ...&#x27;mainstream&#x27; ufologists were almost uniformly hostile to Adamski, holding not only that his and similar contact stories were fraudulent, but that the contactees were making serious UFO investigators look ridiculous.&quot;

On 29 May 1950, Adamski took a photograph of what he alleged to be six unidentified objects in the sky, which appeared to be flying in formation. This same UFO photograph was depicted in an August 1978 commemorative stamp issued by the island nation of Grenada in order to mark the &quot;Year of UFOs.&quot;

===Orthon and the Contactees===
On 20 November 1952, Adamski and several friends were in the California Desert near the town of Desert Center, California, when they purportedly saw a large submarine-shaped object hovering in the sky. Believing that the ship was looking for him, Adamski is said to have left his friends and to have headed away from the main road. Shortly afterwards, according to Adamski&#x27;s accounts, a scout ship made of a type of translucent metal landed close to him, and its pilot, a Venusian called Orthon, disembarked and sought him out. Adamski claimed the people with him also saw the Venusian ship, and several of them later stated they could see Adamski meeting someone in the desert, although from a considerable distance.
Adamski described Orthon as being a medium-height humanoid with long blond hair and tanned skin wearing reddish-brown shoes, though, as Adamski added, &quot;his trousers were not like mine.&quot; Adamski said Orthon communicated with him via telepathy and through hand signals.

During the conversation, Orthon purportedly warned of the dangers of nuclear war, and Adamski later wrote that &quot;the presence of this inhabitant of Venus was like the warm embrace of great love and understanding wisdom.&quot; Adamski claimed Orthon had refused to allow himself to be photographed, and instead, had asked Adamski to provide him with a blank photographic plate, which Adamski claimed he had given Orthon. George Hunt Williamson (a contactee and Adamski associate) also claimed that after Orthon left, he was able to take plaster casts of Orthon&#x27;s shoe imprints. The imprints contained mysterious symbols, which Adamski said was a message from Orthon.

Orthon is said to have returned the photographic plate to Adamski on 13 December 1952; when developed it was found to contain strange new symbols. It was during this meeting that Adamski is said to have taken a now famous photograph of Orthon&#x27;s Venusian scout ship using his telescope. At the time, skeptics said it looked suspiciously like the top of a &quot;chicken brooder&quot;, for warming newly hatched poultry.

Anglo-Irish eccentric Desmond Leslie struck up a correspondence with Adamski. In the mid-1950s Leslie had created a low-budget UFO film entitled &quot;Them In The Thing&quot; at his home, Castle Leslie. The flying saucer in the film had been created by shining mirrors on to a Spanish Renaissance shield suspended from a fishing line. The film was rediscovered in 2010.

In need of money and keen to create a bestseller, Leslie had written a manuscript about the visitation of Earth by aliens. Its genesis had been Leslie chancing upon a copy of the 1896 book &quot;The Story of Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria&quot; by William Scott-Elliot in a friend&#x27;s library.

Adamski sent Leslie a written account of his supposed contact with Orthon, and photos. Leslie combined the two works into the 1953 co-authored book &quot;Flying Saucers Have Landed&quot;. The book became a bestseller, brought both Adamski and Leslie news media attention, and eventually became &quot;a key text of the New Age movement.&quot;

The following year, Leslie visited Adamski in California and claimed to witness several UFOs with him. Leslie described one of them in a letter he sent to his wife while he was in San Diego:

&quot;Flying Saucers Have Landed&quot; claimed Nordic aliens from Venus and other planets in Earth&#x27;s solar system routinely visited the Earth. According to the book, Orthon and other aliens were worried that nuclear bomb tests in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere would kill all life on Earth, spread radiation into space, and contaminate other planets. Adamski claimed that Nordic aliens worshiped a &quot;Creator of All&quot;, but that &quot;we on Earth know very little about this Creator ... our understanding is shallow.&quot;

In his 1955 book &quot;Inside the Space Ships&quot;, Adamski claimed that Orthon arranged for him to be taken on a trip to see the Solar System, including the planet Venus, the location where Orthon said the late Mrs. Adamski had been reincarnated. He claimed that in another voyage he met the 1,000-year-old &quot;elder philosopher of the space people&quot;, who was called &quot;the Master&quot;. Adamski said he and the Master discussed philosophy, religion, and the &quot;Earth&#x27;s place in the universe&quot;. Adamski said he learned that he had been selected by Nordic aliens to bring their message of peace to Earth people, and that other humans throughout history had also served as their messengers, including Jesus Christ. Adamski further claimed that aliens were peacefully living on Earth, and that he had met with them in bars and restaurants in Southern California.

Adamski&#x27;s stories led other people to come forward with their own claims of contact and interplanetary travels with friendly &quot;Space Brothers&quot;, including such figures as Howard Menger, Daniel Fry, George Van Tassel, and Truman Bethurum. The message of Adamski and his fellow contactees was one in which the other planets of Earth&#x27;s solar system were all &quot;inhabited by physically handsome, spiritually evolved beings who have moved beyond the problems of Earth people ... the reader of &quot;Inside the Space Ships&quot; enters a perfect world, the kind we can create here on Earth if we behave ourselves.&quot; Through books, lectures, and conventions, particularly the annual Giant Rock UFO convention near Landers, California, the contactee movement would grow throughout the 1950s. However, Adamski would remain the most prominent, and most influential, of the contactees.

Adamski&#x27;s claims of traveling aboard a UFO inspired an elaborate hoax perpetrated by British astronomer Patrick Moore and his friend Peter Davies using the false identity Cedric Allingham.

===Straith Letter Hoax===
In 1957, Adamski received a letter signed &quot;R.E. Straith,&quot; alleged representative of the &quot;Cultural Exchange Committee&quot; of the U.S. State Department. The letter said the U.S. Government knew that Adamski had spoken to extraterrestrials in a California desert in 1952, and that a group of highly placed government officials planned on public corroboration of Adamski&#x27;s story. Adamski was proud of this endorsement and exhibited it to support his claims.

However, in 1985 ufologist James W. Moseley revealed that the letter was a hoax. Moseley said he and his friend Gray Barker had obtained some official State Department letterheads, created the R.E. Straith persona, and then written the letter to Adamski as a prank. According to Moseley, the FBI investigated the case and discovered that the letter was a hoax, but charges were not filed against Moseley or Barker.

Moseley also wrote that the FBI informed Adamski that the Straith letter was a hoax and asked him to stop using it as evidence in support of his claims, but that Adamski refused and continued to display the letter in his lectures and talks. This was not the first time Adamski had claimed government support for his UFO stories. In 1953 he told a meeting of the Corona, California Lions Club that his &quot;material has all been cleared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Air Force Intelligence.&quot;

When the FBI learned of Adamski&#x27;s claims, three agents were sent to talk to Adamski. He denied having stated that the FBI or USAF intelligence supported his claims (even though his remarks were reported in a local newspaper, the &quot;Riverside Enterprise&quot;), and he agreed to sign a letter stating that &quot;he understood the implications of making false claims&quot; and that the FBI &quot;did not endorse [the claims] of individuals.&quot; The three FBI agents also signed the letter, and a copy was given to Adamski.

However, a few months later, Adamski told an interviewer that he had been &quot;cleared&quot; by the FBI, and displayed the letter as proof. When the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau complained, more FBI agents were sent to retrieve Adamski&#x27;s copy of the letter, &quot;read the riot act to him, and warn him that legal action would be taken if he continued&quot; to claim FBI or government support for his stories. Adamski later said the FBI had &quot;warned [him] to keep quiet.&quot;

===Meeting with Queen Juliana of the Netherlands===
In May 1959, the head of the Dutch Unidentified Flying Objects Society told Adamski she had been contacted by officials at the palace of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands who advised &quot;that the Queen would like to receive you.&quot;

Adamski informed a London newspaper about the invitation, which prompted the court and cabinet to request that the queen cancel her private audience with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the audience, saying, &quot;A hostess cannot slam the door in the face of her guests.&quot; After the audience, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said &quot;The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject.&quot;

The Royal Netherlands Air Force Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Haye Schaper said &quot;The man&#x27;s a pathological case.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the Amsterdam newspaper &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; said: &quot;Once again, Queen Juliana&#x27;s weakness for the preternatural had landed her back in the headlines: she had invited to the palace a crackpot from California who numbered among his friends men from Mars, Venus and other solar-system suburbs.&quot;

Wire services such as United Press International and Reuters circulated reports of the meeting to newspapers around the world.

==Later life==

In 1962, Adamski announced that he would be attending an interplanetary conference held on the planet Saturn. In 1963, Adamski claimed that he had been granted a secret audience with Pope John XXIII and that he had received a &quot;Golden Medal of Honor&quot; from the pope. However, skeptics noted that the medal was actually a common tourist souvenir made by a company in Milan, Italy, and that Adamski displayed it to his friends in a cheap plastic box - which is how it was sold in tourist shops in Rome. Adamski said he met with the Pope at the request of the extraterrestrials he was allegedly in contact with, in order to request a &quot;final agreement&quot; from the Pope because of his decision not to communicate directly with any extraterrestrials, and also to offer him a liquid substance in order to save him from the gastric enteritis that he suffered from, which would later become acute peritonitis.

==Death==
On 23 April 1965, aged 74, Adamski died of a heart attack at a friend&#x27;s home in Silver Spring, Maryland, shortly after giving a UFO lecture in Washington, DC. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Investigations and criticism==
Over the decades, numerous critics and skeptics have investigated Adamski&#x27;s claims. The aliens Adamski claimed to have met in the 1950s were described by him as &quot;human beings from another world&quot;, usually light-skinned, light-haired humanoids that would later be called Nordic aliens. Adamski claimed in his books that these &quot;alien humans&quot; came from Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth&#x27;s solar system. However, none of the planets he mentioned are capable of supporting human life, due to their adverse environmental conditions. The first alien Adamski claimed to have met was from Venus, yet the atmospheric pressure on that planet&#x27;s surface is 92 times greater than that of Earth, and it has clouds which rain a toxic substance thought to be sulfuric acid; the atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide, with very little oxygen, and the average surface temperature of Venus is 464 °C. In one of his books, Adamski described a trip he took to the far side of the Moon in a flying saucer, where he claimed to have seen cities, trees, and snow-capped mountains; he also claimed that the first photographs of the Moon&#x27;s far side that were taken by the Soviet lunar probe Luna 3 in 1959, were altered to depict a barren, lifeless surface to hide what he saw. However, all scientific evidence, as well as later lunar trips by American astronauts, clearly showed that the entire surface of the Moon is barren of life and has no atmosphere.

In his writings, Adamski claimed he travelled to Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth&#x27;s solar system, and clearly stated that they were all capable of supporting humanoid life. As UFO historian Jerome Clark noted, &quot;some Adamski partisans insisted that Venus, Mars, Saturn, and the rest were merely code words for planets in other solar systems; there is, however, nothing in Adamski&#x27;s public writings to support this interpretation and considerable testimony to the contrary.&quot;

Adamski&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;Inside the Space Ships&quot;, which describes his claimed travels through Earth&#x27;s solar system in a UFO, is considered by some critics to be a &quot;remake&quot; of his 1949 science fiction novel, ghostwritten for Adamski by Lucy McGinnis, and entitled &quot;Pioneers of Space&quot;. It described a fictional voyage through the solar system that, critics noted, sounded very similar to the space travels described by Adamski in &quot;Inside the Space Ships&quot;.

===Adamski photographs and Moseley investigation===
Adamski&#x27;s photographs of objects he claimed were UFOs have also come under scrutiny. His frequently published photograph from 1952, depicts an object which has been variously identified as the top of a chicken brooder or a streetlight. Adamski claimed that movie director Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s top trick photographer, J. Peverell Marley, had examined his UFO photos and found a &quot;spaceman&quot; in them, and Marley himself declared that if Adamski&#x27;s pictures were fakes, they were the best he had ever seen. In the United Kingdom, 14 experts from the J. Arthur Rank company concluded that the object photographed was either real or a full-scale model.

However, in his 1955 investigation into Adamski&#x27;s claims, James W. Moseley interviewed Marley, who stated that he had never enlarged the photos for analysis nor found a &quot;spaceman&quot; in them, and did not know of anyone who had. Moseley also interviewed German rocket scientist Walther Johannes Riedel, who told him that he had analyzed Adamski&#x27;s UFO photos and found them to be fakes. Riedel told Moseley that the UFO&#x27;s &quot;landing struts&quot; were actually 100-watt General Electric light bulbs, and that he had seen the round &quot;GE&quot; logo printed on them. In 2012, UFO researcher Joel Carpenter identified the reflector-shade of a widely available 1930s pressurised-gas lantern as an identical visual match to the main portion of Adamski&#x27;s saucer.

In his 1955 investigation, Moseley found other flaws in Adamski&#x27;s story. He interviewed several of the people that Adamski claimed had been with him in his initial 20 November 1952 meeting with Orthon, and found that these witnesses contradicted Adamski&#x27;s claims. One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard &quot;a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc.&quot; several days before Adamski&#x27;s claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski&#x27;s meeting with Orthon was a &quot;planned operation.&quot; Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: &quot;Now you know the [UFO] picture connected to your name is in the book (&quot;Flying Saucers Have Landed&quot;) too. And with people knowing that you are connected with flying saucers ... you could do yourself a lot of good. You could give lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! You could support yourself by the picture in the book with your name.&quot;

Moseley discovered that George Hunt Williamson, another prominent contactee and friend of Adamski, did not witness any UFO nor Adamski&#x27;s encounter with Orthon, despite his public statements claiming otherwise. When Irma Baker, Jerrold Baker&#x27;s wife, accused him of lying about the incident, Williamson told her cryptically that &quot;sometimes to gain admittance, one has to go around the back door.&quot; In his report on Adamski, Moseley wrote &quot;I do believe most definitely that Adamski&#x27;s narrative contains enough flaws to place in very serious doubt both his veracity and his sincerity. The reader will be moved to make for himself a careful re-evaluation of the worth of Adamski&#x27;s book.&quot;

===Air Force investigation===
During the early-to-mid 1950s, USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt was the head of Project Blue Book, the Air Force group assigned to investigate UFO reports. In 1953, Captain Ruppelt decided to investigate Adamski&#x27;s UFO claims. He traveled to California&#x27;s Palomar Mountain and, dressed in civilian attire to avoid attracting attention, attended one of Adamski&#x27;s lectures before a large crowd at his Palomar Gardens Cafe.

Ruppelt concluded that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories were designed to make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman P.T. Barnum. In describing Adamski&#x27;s speaking style, Ruppelt wrote &quot;to look at the man and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him ... he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I&#x27;ve ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that &#x27;most people think I&#x27;m crazy, but honestly, I&#x27;m really not.&#x27;&quot; According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, &quot;you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop&quot; in the cafe as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski&#x27;s UFO photos that were on sale in the cafe. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that &quot;people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski&#x27;s story.&quot;

Ruppelt believed &quot;the common undertone to many of these [contactee] stories ... is Utopia. On these other worlds there is no illness, they&#x27;ve learned how to cure all diseases. There are no wars, they&#x27;ve learned how to live peaceably. There is no poverty, everyone has everything he wants. There is no old age, they have learned the secret of eternal life ... Too many times this subtle pitch can be boiled down to, &quot;Step right up folks and put a donation in the pot. I&#x27;m just on the verge of learning the spaceman&#x27;s secrets and with a little money to carry out my work I&#x27;ll give &quot;you&quot; the secret.&quot;

According to Ruppelt, by 1960, Adamski&#x27;s UFO lectures and in particular his first two books, had brought him financial security: &quot;[His] hamburger stand is boarded up and he now lives in a big ranch house. He vacations in Mexico and has his own clerical staff. His two books &quot;Flying Saucers Have Landed&quot; and &quot;Inside the Space Ships&quot; have sold ... 200,000 copies and have been translated into every language except Russian.&quot; Ruppelt humorously noted that by 1960 two &quot;beautiful spacewomen&quot; who claimed to be Nordic aliens were dating Adamski, a blonde from Saturn called &quot;Kalna&quot; and another woman named &quot;Ilmuth&quot;.

<doc id="250129" wikidata="Q183584" url="?curid=250129" title="Lanzhou">
<text>Lanzhou is the capital and largest city of Gansu province in northwestern China. Located on the banks of the Yellow River, it is a key regional transportation hub, connecting areas further west by rail to the eastern half of the country. Historically, it has been a major link on the Northern Silk Road and it stands to become a major hub on the New Eurasian Land Bridge. The city is also a center for heavy industry and petrochemical industry.

Lanzhou is the third largest city in Northwest China after Xi&#x27;an and Urumqi. Lanzhou is also an important center for scientific research and education in Northwestern China after Xi&#x27;an. The city is one of the top 60 major cities in the world by scientific research output as tracked by the Nature Index. It hosts several research institutions, including, Lanzhou University, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou University of Technology, Gansu Agricultural University, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, and Lanzhou Jiaotong University. Notably, Lanzhou University is one of China&#x27;s prestige universities as a member of the Project 985.

==History==

Originally in the territory of the ancient Western Qiangs, Lanzhou became part of the territory of the State of Qin in the 6th century BC.

In 81 BC, under the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220), it was taken from the Huns&#x27; Huandi Chanyu and made the seat of Jincheng commandery (), and later of the Jincheng (Golden City) county (), later renamed &quot;Yunwu&quot;. From at least the first millennium BC it was a major link on the ancient Northern Silk Road, and also an important historic Yellow River crossing site. To protect the city, the Great Wall of China was extended as far as Yumen. Parts of the Great Wall still exist within the built-up area.

After the fall of the Han dynasty, Lanzhou became the capital of a succession of tribal states. In the 4th century it was briefly the capital of the independent state of Liang. The Northern Wei dynasty (386–534) reestablished Jincheng commandery, renaming the county Jincheng. Mixed with different cultural heritages, the area at present-day Gansu province, from the 5th to the 11th century, became a center for Buddhist study. Under the Sui dynasty (581–618) the city became the seat of Lanzhou prefecture for the first time, retaining this name under the Tang dynasty (618–907). In 763 the area was overrun by the Tibetan Empire and in 843 was conquered by the Tang. Later it fell into the hands of the Western Xia dynasty (which flourished in Qinghai from the 11th to 13th century) and was subsequently absorbed by the Song dynasty (960–1126) in 1081. The name Lanzhou was reestablished, and the county renamed Lanzhuan.

After 1127 it fell into the hands of the Jin dynasty, and after 1235 it came into the possession of the Mongol Empire.

Under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) the prefecture was demoted to a county and placed under the administration of Lintao superior prefecture, but in 1477 Lanzhou was reestablished as a political unit.

The city acquired its current name in 1656, during the Qing dynasty. When Gansu was made a separate province in 1666, Lanzhou became its capital.

In 1739 the seat of Lintao was transferred to Lanzhou, which was later made a superior prefecture called Lanzhou.

Lanzhou was badly damaged during the Dungan revolt in 1864–1875. In the 1920s and 1930s it became a center of Soviet influence in northwestern China.
===Second Sino-Japanese War-World War II===
During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) Lanzhou, linked with Xi&#x27;an by highway in 1935, became the terminus of the Chinese–Soviet highway, used as a route for Soviet supplies destined for the Xi&#x27;an area. This highway remained the primary traffic route of northwestern China until the completion of the railway from Lanzhou to Ürümqi, Xinjiang.

===The Battle of Lanzhou===
Lanzhou&#x27;s old &quot;Donggang&quot; Airport, located near the city centre, was the primary entry point for combat aircraft provided to China under the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and along with other targets around Lanzhou, including civilian centers, were heavily bombed by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force and Navy Air Force. Many air battles were fought between the Chinese Air Force and the Imperial Japanese air forces over Lanzhou and surrounding regions from 1937 to 1945, particularly from 1938 to 1941 when the influx of Soviet war materials formed the primary support in China&#x27;s War of Resistance against the Imperial Japanese invasion. Instances of major air-battles include an IJAAF raid consisting of 30 BR.20 and Ki-21 bombers against civilian targets in Lanzhou on 20 February 1939; 17th PS, 5th PG commander Capt. Cen Zeliu and his deputy commander Capt. Ma Guolian (Ma Kwok-Lim), a Canadian-Chinese volunteer for the Chinese Air Force, shot down the first two bombers in the battle, followed by two more downed as Capt. Cen led another attack on the third formation. They would be joined by pilots of the Soviet Volunteer Group led by Nikolay Garilov and the 15th PS led by Li Debiao, who would all shoot down five more of the Japanese bombers; the northern Chinese air-raid early-warning net headquarters in Xi&#x27;an observed 21 of the original 30 IJAAF bombers returning from Lanzhou.

As the Imperial Japanese forces were preparing for &quot;Operation Z&quot; against the United States and other allies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific by mid-1941, the IJANF were busy training new aircrews in live combat action across China for the upcoming war in the Pacific; on 22 May 1941, Lt. Gao Youxin of the 21st PS, 4th PG engaged an IJNAF raid on Lanzhou in an I-16 fighter aircraft, while avoiding confrontation against the &quot;Zero&quot; fighters, he shot down a Mitsubishi G3M bomber north of Lanzhou. On the ground, the KMT Muslim Generals Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang protected Lanzhou with their cavalry troops, putting up such resistance that the Japanese never captured Lanzhou.

==Geography==
At above sea level, Lanzhou lies in China&#x27;s northwest geographical center. The metropolitan area covers more than of urbanisation along the southern banks of the Yellow River, which flows through from west to east. The Qilian Ranges, Mt. Pingliang, and Mt. Kongtong are located on the south and north sides of the city.

Lanzhou is situated on the upper reaches of the Yellow River where it emerges from the mountains and has been a center since early times, being at the southern end of the route leading via the Hexi Corridor across Central Asia. It commands the approaches to the ancient capital area of Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) in Shaanxi province from both the west and the northwest, as well as the area of Qinghai Lake via the upper waters of the Yellow River and its tributaries.
===Climate ===

Lanzhou is situated in the temperate zone and has a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers and cold and very dry winters. In the urban core, based on 1971–2000 normals, the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July. The mean annual temperature is , while annual rainfall is , almost all of which falls from May to October. The winters are so dry that snowfall is sometimes restricted to fall and spring. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47 percent in September to 57 percent in April, sunshine is generous but not abundant, as the city receives 2,350 hours of bright sunshine annually.

===Environmental problems===

The city is located in a narrow and curved river valley with surrounding mountains causing it to be hemmed in blocking a free flow of air. According to the National Environmental Analysis released by Tsinghua University and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, Lanzhou was among the ten most air-polluted cities in the world. Air quality reportedly was so poor that at times one could not see Lanshan, the mountain rising up along the south side of the city. Lanzhou is also the home of many factories, including some involved in petroleum processing, and suffers from large dust storms kicked up from the Gobi Desert, especially in the winter and spring. In 2011, using Chinese statistics, the World Health Organization reported that Lanzhou had the worst air quality among eleven western Chinese cities. Its annual mean PM10 μg/m3 of 150 is 7 times the safe level established by the World Health Organization. It was worse than Beijing with its reading of 121.

Since then, authorities have taken measures to improve air quality, which have largely been successful. &quot;Thirteen polluting enterprises with excessive capacity have been closed, more than 200 highly polluting enterprises were suspended in winter, and 78 industrial enterprises have moved to an industrial park outside the city.&quot; In 2015 it was awarded China&#x27;s climate progress title. As a city once unable to be spotted from satellites, Lanzhou has taken various measures to combat air pollution in recent years, having reduced its Air Pollution Index at the fastest speed across China. According to the 2018 WHO database, of 2700 towns listed, Lanzhou has the 158th highest level of PM 2.5 pollution, with an average of 54 micrograms per cubic meter (twice that of Milan). The large particle PM10 remains high, at 132 micrograms per cubic meter, in part as a result of sand storms.

The reach of the Yellow River at Lanzhou carries a high load of silt, giving the river its characteristic muddy appearance; however water quality in this reach is better than the &quot;fetid outflow that barely passes for water two hours downstream&quot; (2008). In recent years, several specimens of the endangered Chinese giant salamander have been found in and near the Yellow River in Lanzhou.

On April 11, 2014, Lanzhou officials advised residents not to drink tap water, because benzene levels were 20 times the national limit of 10 micrograms per liter. The city water supply suspected industrial chemical production to be the culprit, similar to what happened in the 2005 Jilin chemical plant explosions.

A brucellosis outbreak infecting humans took place in Lanzhou in 2020 after the Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Plant involved in vaccine production accidentally pumped out the bacteria into the atmosphere in exhaust air, due to use of expired desinfectant, and affecting over 3,000 people.
===Earthquakes===
Lanzhou experiences earthquakes regularly, although usually at low intensities. In 1920 a large earthquake was experienced killing more than 100,000 people in Ningxia and Eastern Gansu province, although only 42 were killed in Lanzhou itself, the low number being attributed to the strong yet flexible nature of the wooden buildings in the city. Lanzhou was also affected by 2008 Sichuan earthquake in 2008.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2020 Chinese census, Lanzhou surpassed 4 million population for the first time, with a total population of 4,359,446 inhabitants and 3,042,863 in the built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area of 1,112.9 square kilometres (429.7 sq mi) made of the 4 central urban districts (Chengguan, Qilihe, Anning and Xigu District). Lanzhou New Area, near the airport and Honggu Districts are not yet conurbated. The growth increased significantly after a period of slower growth. The strong growth has been attributed to parents seeking better education opportunities for their children, retired migrant workers returning to Gansu, improved services in the city and government policies.

==Sport==
The 14,000-capacity Northwest Minzu University Stadium is one of the main sports venues in the city. It is mostly used for football games. A new sports center complex, including a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 spectators and a swimming hall, is under development.

Lanzhou previously had a professional soccer team named Gansu Tianma from 1999 to 2003.The team played in Chinese Football Association Yi League from 1999 to 2001 and bought a position in the Jia League from Tianjin Lifei. The team relocated to Ningbo, Zhejiang and changed their name to Ningbo Yaoma in 2003. The team later relegated to China League Two in 2004 and became Dongguan Dongcheng after moving to Dongguan, Guangdong.

Former England international Paul Gascoigne played four games in both a playing and coaching role for Gansu in 2003, scoring two goals, before returning to England after falling out with the club, as his mental state meant that he had to return to America for treatment against drink and depression.

==Administrative divisions==

<text>Rationing is the controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, services, or an artificial restriction of demand. Rationing controls the size of the ration, which is one&#x27;s allowed portion of the resources being distributed on a particular day or at a particular time. There are many forms of rationing, although rationing by price is most prevalent.

Rationing is often done to keep price below the market-clearing price determined by the process of supply and demand in an unfettered market. Thus, rationing can be complementary to price controls. An example of rationing in the face of rising prices took place in the various countries where there was rationing of gasoline during the 1973 energy crisis.

A reason for setting the price lower than would clear the market may be that there is a high input
, which would drive the market price very high. High prices, especially in the case of necessities, are undesirable with regard to those who cannot afford them. However, economists point out that high prices act to reduce waste of the scarce resource, while also providing incentive to produce more.

Rationing using ration stamps is only one kind of non-price rationing. For example, scarce products can be rationed using queues. This is seen, for example, at amusement parks, where one pays a price to get in and then need not pay any price to go on the rides. Similarly, in the absence of road pricing, access to roads is rationed in a first come, first served queueing process, leading to congestion.

Authorities which introduce rationing often have to deal with the rationed goods being sold illegally on the black market. Despite the fact that rationing systems are sometimes necessary as the only viable option for societies facing severe consumer goods shortages, they are usually extremely unpopular with the general public, as they enforce limits on individual consumption.

==Civilian rationing==
Rationing for civilians has most often been instituted during wartime. For example, each person may be given &quot;ration coupons&quot; which allow them to purchase a certain amount of a product each month. Rationing often includes food and other necessities for which there is a shortage, including materials needed for the war effort such as rubber tires, leather shoes, clothing, and fuel.
Rationing of food and water may also become necessary during an emergency, such as a natural disaster or terror attack.

In the U.S., the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established guidelines for rationing food and water when replacements are not available. According to FEMA standards, every person should have a minimum of per day of water, and more for children, nursing mothers, and the ill.

===Origins===
Military sieges have often resulted in shortages of food and other essentials. In such circumstances, the rations allocated to an individual have often been determined based on age, sex, race or social standing. During the Siege of Lucknow (part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857) women received three-quarters of a man&#x27;s food ration. Children received only half. During the Siege of Ladysmith in the early stages of the Boer War in 1900, white adults received the same food rations as soldiers while children received half that. Food rations for Indian people and black people were significantly smaller.

The first modern rationing systems were imposed during the First World War. In Germany, suffering from the effects of the British blockade, a rationing system was introduced in 1914 and was steadily expanded over the following years as the situation worsened. Although Britain did not suffer from food shortages, as the sea lanes were kept open for food imports, panic buying towards the end of the war prompted the rationing of first sugar and then meat. It is said to have benefited the overall health of the country, through the &quot;levelling of consumption of essential foodstuffs&quot;. To assist with rationing, ration books were introduced on 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar. During the war, average caloric intake decreased by only three percent, but protein intake by six percent.

Food rationing appeared in Poland after the First World War, and ration stamps were in use until the end of the Polish–Soviet War.

===Second World War===

Rationing became common during the Second World War. Ration stamps were often used. These were redeemable stamps or coupons, and every family was issued a set number of each kind of stamp based on the size of the family, ages of children, and income. The British Ministry of Food refined the rationing process in the early 1940s to ensure the population did not starve when food imports were severely restricted and local production limited due to the large number of men fighting the war.

Rationing on a scientific basis was pioneered by Elsie Widdowson and Robert McCance at the Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Cambridge. They worked on the chemical composition of the human body, and on the nutritional value of different flours used to make bread. Widdowson also studied the impact of infant diet on human growth. They studied the differing effects from deficiencies of salt and of water and produced the first tables to compare the nutritional contents of foods before and after cooking. They co-authored &quot;The Chemical Composition of Foods&quot;, first published in 1940 by the Medical Research Council. Their book, &quot;McCance and Widdowson&quot;, became known as the dietician&#x27;s bible and formed the basis for modern nutritional thinking.

In 1939, they tested whether the United Kingdom could survive with only domestic food production if U-boats ended all imports. Using 1938 food-production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers a limited diet, while simulating the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects&#x27; health and performance remained very good after three months. They also headed the first ever mandated addition of vitamins and minerals to food, beginning with adding calcium to bread. Their work became the basis of the wartime austerity diet promoted by the Minister of Food, Lord Woolton.

The British public&#x27;s wartime diet was never as severe as in the Cambridge study because German U-boats failed to halt trans-Atlantic supply, but rationing improved the health of British people: infant mortality declined and life expectancy rose. This was because everyone had access to a varied diet with enough nutrients.

The first commodity to be controlled was petrol. On 8 January 1940, bacon, butter and sugar were rationed. This was followed by successive rationing schemes for meat, tea, jam, biscuits, breakfast cereals, cheese, eggs, lard, milk, and canned and dried fruit. Fresh vegetables and fruit were not rationed, but supplies were limited. Many people grew their own vegetables, greatly encouraged by the highly successful &quot;Digging for Victory&quot; campaign. Most controversial was bread; it was not rationed until after the war ended, but the &quot;national loaf&quot; of wholemeal bread replaced the ordinary white variety, to the distaste of most housewives who found it mushy, grey, and easy to blame for digestive problems. Fish was not rationed, but fish prices increased considerably as the war progressed.
In May 1941, Woolton appealed to Americans to reduce consumption of certain foods (dairy, sugar canned salmon and meat) so more of those could go to the United Kingdom. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) warned Americans of potential gasoline, steel, aluminum and electricity shortages. It believed that with factories converting to military production and consuming many critical supplies, rationing would become necessary if the country entered the war. It established a rationing system after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board was set up to coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain.
American civilians first received ration books—War Ration Book Number One, or the &quot;Sugar Book&quot;—on 4 May 1942, through more than 100,000 school teachers, Parent-Teacher Associations, and other volunteers. Sugar was the first consumer commodity rationed. Bakeries, ice cream makers, and other commercial users received rations of about 70% of normal usage. Coffee was rationed on 27 November 1942 to every five weeks. By the end of 1942, ration coupons were used for nine other items. Typewriters, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, silk, nylon, fuel oil, stoves, meat, lard, shortening and cooking oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies, and fruit butters were rationed by November 1943.

The work of issuing ration books and exchanging used stamps for certificates was handled by some 5,500 local ration boards of mostly volunteers. As a result of the gasoline rationing, all forms of automobile racing, including the Indianapolis 500, were banned. All rationing in the United States ended in 1946.
In the Soviet Union food was rationed from 1941 to 1947. In particular, daily bread rations in besieged Leningrad were initially set at . By the end of 1941 the bread rations were reduced to for workers and for everyone else, which resulted in a surge of deaths caused by starvation. Starting in 1942 daily bread rations were increased to for workers and for everyone else. One of the documents of the period is the diary of Tanya Savicheva, who recorded the deaths of each member of her family during the siege.

Rationing was also introduced to a number of British dominions, and colonies, with rationing of clothing imposed in Australia, from 12 June 1942, and certain foodstuffs from 1943. Canada rationed tea, coffee, sugar, butter and mechanical spares, between 1942 and 1947. The Cochin, Travancore and Madras states, of British India elected to ration grain between the fall of 1943 and spring 1944. Egypt introduced a ration card-based subsidy of essential foodstuffs in 1945 that has persisted into the 21st century. New Zealand rationing in began in 1942 and was abolished on most foods in 1948, but continued on butter until 1950.

Similarly rationing was introduced across the Japanese empire, as commodities such as rice became scarce in territories, after the destruction of the transport infrastructure that once served colonies.

Many countries had gasoline rationing that determined how much gasoline could be filled in a fuel tank, depending on whether the driver was essential to the war effort.

===Peacetime rationing===

Civilian peacetime rationing of food has been employed after natural disasters, during contingencies, or after failed governmental economic policies regarding production or distribution, as well as due to extensive austerity programs implemented to cut or restrict public spending in countries where the rationed goods previously relied on government procurement or subsidies, as was the case in Israel.

In the United Kingdom, rationing remained for years after the end of the war. In some respects it was more strict after the war than during it—two major foodstuffs that were never rationed during the war, bread and potatoes, were rationed after it (bread from 1946 to 1948, and potatoes for a time from 1947). Tea was still rationed until 1952. In 1953 rationing of sugar and eggs ended and in 1954, all rationing was abolished when cheese and meats came off ration. Sugar was again rationed in 1974 after Caribbean producers began selling to the more lucrative United States market.

Some centralized planned economies introduced peacetime rationing systems due to food shortages in the postwar period. North Korea and China did so in the 1970s and 1980s, as did Socialist Republic of Romania during Ceausescu&#x27;s rule in the 1980s, the Soviet Union in 1990–1991, and from 1962–present in Cuba. 
From 1949 to 1959, Israel was under a regime of austerity, during which rationing was enforced. At first, only staple foods such as cooking oil, sugar, and margarine were rationed, but it was later expanded, and eventually included furniture and footwear. Every month, each citizen would get food coupons worth six Israeli pounds, and every family would be allotted food. The average Israeli diet was 2,800 calories a day, with additional calories for children, the elderly, and pregnant women.

Following the 1952 Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany, and the subsequent influx of foreign capital, Israel&#x27;s economy was bolstered, and in 1953, most restrictions were cancelled. In 1958, the list of rationed goods was narrowed to just eleven, and in 1959, it was narrowed to only jam, sugar, and coffee.
Petroleum products were rationed in many countries following the 1973 oil crisis. The United States introduced odd–even rationing for fuels during the crisis, which allowed only vehicles with even-numbered numberplates to fill up on gas one day and odd-numbered ones on another.

Poland enacted rationing in 1981 to cope with economic crisis. The rationing system initially encompassed most of the population&#x27;s daily necessities, but was gradually phased out over time, with the last ration being abolished in 1989.

Rationing in Cuba for basic goods was enacted in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had previously subsidised the island nation&#x27;s economy. Rationing started being phased out in the year 2000 at the end of the &quot;special period&quot;, as Cuba had shifted to a more diversified and self-sustaining economy. Rationing, however, was not fully abolished and instead turned into an alternative way to purchase goods, in addition to the markets. This makes a curious departure from classical rationing, as during the 2001–2019 period, the rationing system was used in addition to, instead of as a replacement for regular markets. Cubans would be able to buy a certain amount of items at &#x27;liberated&#x27; prices using ration coupons at a significantly reduced rate, while still being able to purchase more at regular market prices. This &#x27;liberated&#x27; system persisted even during Cuba&#x27;s period of economic growth and relative prosperity during the early and mid 2010s and enjoyed considerable popularity among the island&#x27;s citizens. Cuba later re-introduced a classical limiting rationing system in 2019, following the imposition of strict sanctions on the island by US President Donald Trump, as well as the collapse of petroleum shipments from Venezuela, which was facing its own economic troubles at that time. Cuba&#x27;s president pitched the new system as significantly more lenient than the 1991–2000 &quot;special period&quot;, though admitted that it would negatively affect consumption.
Short-term rationing for gas and other fuels was introduced in the U.S. states of New Jersey and New York following Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

In April 2019, Venezuela announced a 30-day electricity rationing regime in the face of power shortages.

For a few years during a series of droughts in California (from 2015 to 2019), the California State Water Resources Control Board had mandatory water-use restrictions.

In 2021, Sri Lanka, facing a major economic crisis, is considering introducing food rationing. According to &quot;The Hindu&quot;, &quot;President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has called in the army to manage the crisis by rationing the supply of various essential goods.&quot;

In 2023, Iran began the National Credit Network mechanism.

, peacetime rationing for basic foodstuffs and similar goods is in effect in Cuba and North Korea.

===Refugee aid rations===

Aid agencies, such as the World Food Programme, provide food rations and other essentials to refugees or internally displaced persons who are registered with the UNHCR and are either living in refugee camps or are supported in urban centres. Every registered refugee is given a ration card upon registration which is used for collecting the rations from food distribution centres. The 2,100 calories allocated per person per day is based on minimal standards and is frequently not achieved, as has been the case in Kenya.

According to Article 20 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees refugees shall be treated as national citizens in rationing schemes when there is a rationing system in place for the general population.

==Other types==

===Health-care rationing===
As the British Royal Commission on the National Health Service observed in 1979, &quot;whatever the expenditure on health care, demand is likely to rise to meet and exceed it&quot;. Rationing health care to control costs is regarded as an explosive issue in the US, but in reality health care is rationed everywhere. In places where a government provides healthcare, rationing is explicit. In other places people are denied treatment because of personal lack of funds, or because of decisions made by insurance companies. The American Supreme Court approved paying doctors to ration care, stating that there must be &quot;some incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing&quot;. Shortages of organs for donation forces the rationing of organs for transplant even when funding is available.

=== Cultural rationing ===
Censorship, libraries and museums can function to limit, moderate and share out approved cultural goods, experiences and exposures to the general public.

===Credit rationing===
Credit rationing describes a situation wherein a bank limits the supply of loans, even when it has enough funds to loan, and the provision of loans has not yet equaled the demand of prospective borrowers. Changing the price of the loans (interest rate) does not balance loan demand and supply.

===Carbon rationing===
Personal carbon trading refers to proposed emissions trading schemes under which emissions credits are allocated to adult individuals on a (broadly) equal per capita basis, within national carbon budgets. Individuals then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity. Individuals wanting or needing to emit at a level above that permitted by their initial allocation would be able to engage in emissions trading and purchase additional credits. Conversely, those individuals who emit at a level below that permitted by their initial allocation have the opportunity to sell their surplus credits. Thus, individual trading under Personal Carbon Trading is similar to the trading of companies under EU ETS.

Personal carbon trading is sometimes confused with carbon offsetting due to the similar notion of paying for emissions allowances, but is a quite different concept designed to be mandatory and to guarantee that nations achieve their domestic carbon emissions targets (rather than attempting to do so via international trading or offsetting).

==Rationing mechanisms==

The purpose of rationing is to guarantee a minimum of some resource or to impose a maximum limit on its use. (The latter is the case with carbon rationing, where the scarcity is artificial). Usually, the government determines a fair ration, for example, one proportional to the number of family members. If participants possess different rights to a portion (even when they have the same need) and there is not enough for everyone, then one of the many algorithms for solving the bankruptcy problem may apply.

Sweden from 1919 to 1955 and Finland from 1944 to 1970, also Estonia from 1 July 1920 to 31 December 1925 sought to limit the consumption of alcohol by rationing with Bratt System, where each household was given a booklet (&quot;motbok&quot; in Sweden, &quot;viinakortti&quot; in Finland, &quot;tšekisüsteem&quot; in Estonia), where after each purchase of alcoholic beverages, a stamp was added, based on the amount of alcohol bought. If the buyer had reached their monthly ration, they would have to wait until next month to buy more. The rations were based on gender, income, wealth and social status, with unemployed people and welfare recipients not being allowed to buy any alcohol at all. In addition, since the &quot;motboks&quot; were distributed per household, not per person, wives had to share their household allowance with their husbands, and in fact thus got nothing at all. People often sought to circumvent the rationing by making frequent use of friends or even strangers&#x27; booklets, for example by rewarding a young woman with a dinner out in return for the other party consuming most or all of the alcohol incurring the stamps. Alcohol rationing was eventually abolished in Sweden with the opening of state-owned Systembolaget liquor stores, where people could buy alcoholic beverages without limit.

At other times, the ration can only be estimated by the beneficiary, such as a factory for which energy is to be rationed. In such cases, a mechanism is needed to discourage misreporting the needs or wants (i.e., to meet strategy-proofness). Suppose every participant reports an ideal ration. For so-called uniform rationing, each ration is set to the minimum of the participant&#x27;s ideal ration and a cap, the cap being determined so that the sum of the rations equals the amount available. So, loosely speaking, the participant asking least will be served first. This mechanism is strategy-proof, avoids unnecessary waste (Pareto optimality) and equally treats equals (anonymity.) In fact, it is the only such mechanism. (Anonymity in this statement can be replaced by envyfreeness). For the redistribution of scarce goods to demanders by suppliers, see non-monetary microeconomies.

For smooth supply chain management the supplies may be rationed, which is sometimes referred to as the rationing game. The references mentioned here are a small sample of the literature about rationing inventories.

== Ration stamp ==


A ration stamp, ration coupon, or ration card is a stamp or card issued by a government to allow the holder to obtain food or other commodities that are in short supply during wartime or in other emergency situations when rationing is in force. Ration stamps were widely used during World War II by both sides after hostilities caused interruption to the normal supply of goods. They were also used after the end of the war while the economies of the belligerents gradually returned to normal. Ration stamps were also used to help maintain the amount of food one could hold at a time. This was so that one person would not have more food than another.

===India===

Rationing has been present in India since World War II. A ration card allows households to purchase highly subsidised food grain, sugar and kerosene from their local Public distribution system (PDS) shop.

There are two types of ration cards:
* Priority ration cards (replaced the erstwhile above poverty line and below poverty line ration cards after the enactment of the National Food Security Act in 2013)
* Antyodaya (AAY) ration cards, issued to the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot;

===United States===

Rationing was used in the United States during World War II.

Government funds provided to poverty stricken individuals by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are often referred to colloquially as &quot;food stamps&quot;. The parallels between these &quot;food stamps&quot; and ration stamps as used in war time rationing is limited, however, since food can be purchased in the United States on the regular market without the use of stamps.

===United Kingdom===

Rationing was widespread in the United Kingdom during World War II and continued long after the end of the war. It has been credited with greatly increasing public health. Fuel rationing did not end until 1950.

===Poland===
Ration cards were used in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic in two periods: April 1952 to January 1953 and August 1976 to July 1989.

If one were to buy more food than specified on the stamp, they had to pay 2.5 times the price.

<text>The Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) was a British research establishment, known by several different names during its history, that eventually came under the aegis of the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), before finally losing its identity in mergers with other institutions.

The British Army Balloon Factory was established on Farnborough Common in the early 1900s. By 1912 it had come under civilian control and was the Royal Aircraft Factory (RAF) In 1918 it was renamed Royal Aircraft Establishment to prevent confusion with the newly created Royal Air Force.

The first site was at Farnborough Airfield (&quot;RAE Farnborough&quot;) in Hampshire to which was added a second site RAE Bedford (Bedfordshire) in 1946.

On 1 May 1988 it was renamed the Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE) before merging with other research entities to become part of the new Defence Research Agency in 1991.

==History==
In 1904–1906 the Army Balloon Factory, which was part of the Army School of Ballooning, under the command of Colonel James Templer, relocated from Aldershot to the edge of Farnborough Common in order to have enough space to inflate the new &quot;dirigible balloon&quot; or airship which was then under construction. Templer&#x27;s place was taken by Colonel John Capper and Templer himself retired in 1908. Besides balloons and airships, the factory also experimented with Samuel Franklin Cody&#x27;s war kites and aeroplanes designed both by Cody and J. W. Dunne. In October 1908 Cody made the first aeroplane flight in the United Kingdom at Farnborough.

In 1909 Army work on aeroplanes ceased and the Factory was brought under civilian control. Capper was replaced as Superintendent by Mervyn O&#x27;Gorman. In 1912 the Balloon Factory was renamed the Royal Aircraft Factory (RAF). Its first new designer was Geoffrey de Havilland who later founded his own company. Later colleagues included John Kenworthy who became chief engineer and designer at the Austin Motor Company in 1918 and who went on to found the Redwing Aircraft Co in 1930 and Henry Folland – later chief designer at Gloster Aircraft Company, and founder of his own company Folland Aircraft. One of the designers in the engine department was Samuel Heron, who later went on to invent the sodium-filled poppet valve, instrumental in achieving greater power levels from piston engines. While at the RAF, Heron designed a radial engine that he was not able to build during his time there, however upon leaving the RAF he then went to Siddeley-Deasy where the design, the RAF.8, was developed as the Jaguar. Heron later moved to the United States where he worked on the design of the Wright Whirlwind.
Other engineers included Major F.M. Green, G.S. Wilkinson, James E. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Ellor, Prof. A.H. Gibson, and A.A. Griffith. Both Ellor and Griffith would later go on to work for Rolls-Royce Limited.

In 1918 the Royal Aircraft Factory was once more renamed, becoming the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) to avoid confusion with the Royal Air Force, which was formed on 1 April 1918, and because it had relinquished its manufacturing role to concentrate on research.

During WWII the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment, which had moved from Felixstowe to a safer location at Helensburgh in Scotland, was under the control of the RAE. In 1946 work began to convert RAF Thurleigh into RAE Bedford. Engineers at the Royal Aircraft Establishment invented high strength carbon fibre in 1963. In 1961, the world&#x27;s first grooved runway for reduced aquaplaning was constructed. In 1965, a US delegation visited to view the new surfacing practice and initiated a study by the FAA and NASA.

On 1 May 1988 the RAE was renamed the Royal Aerospace Establishment. On 1 April 1991 the RAE was merged into the Defence Research Agency (DRA), the MOD&#x27;s new research organisation. Then, on 1 April 1995 the DRA and other MOD organisations merged to form the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). The Bedford site was largely shut down in 1994. In 2001 DERA was part-privatised by the MOD, resulting in two separate organisations, the state-owned Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and the privatised company QinetiQ.

; Aircraft

The unit used various aircraft such as : Hawker Hunter, English Electric Canberra B.6 WK163 &amp; B.6 WH953, BAC One-Eleven Series 402 XX919, Hawker Siddeley HS.125 XW930, and Douglas Dakota ZA947. During February 1988 the last Westland Wessex left after 30 years of trials work.

==Royal Aircraft Factory==

===Aircraft Factory designs===
Between 1911 and 1918 the Royal Aircraft Factory produced a number of aircraft designs. Most of these were essentially research aircraft, but a few actually went into mass production, especially during the war period. Some orders were met by the factory itself, but the bulk of production was by private British companies, some of which had not previously built aircraft.

Up to about 1913 the designation letters referred to the general layout of the aircraft, derived from a French manufacturer or designer famous for that type:
* S.E. = Santos Experimental (Canard or tail-first layout)
* B.E. = Blériot Experimental (Tractor or propeller-first layout)
* F.E. = Farman Experimental (Pusher or propeller behind the pilot layout)

From 1913/4 onwards this was changed to a designation based on the role for which the aircraft was designed:
* A.E. = Armed or Armoured Experimental
* C.E. = Coastal Experimental (e.g. Royal Aircraft Factory C.E.1 – prototype only)
* F.E. = Fighting experimental (although they remained &quot;Farmans&quot; in the sense of being pushers)
* N.E. = Night Experimental (e.g. Royal Aircraft Factory N.E.1 – prototype only)
* R.E. = Reconnaissance experimental (two-seat machines)
* S.E. = Scout experimental fast single-seat aircraft.

The B.S.1 of 1913 was a one-off anomaly, combining both systems: Blériot (tractor) Scout (fighter).

R.T. &amp; T.E. were also used for strictly one-off prototypes.

===Designs produced===
Several aircraft were produced during the days as the Army Balloon Factory. These include the airships as well as the Cody and Dunne designs.

Subsequent Royal Aircraft Factory type designations are inconsistent and confusing. For instance the &quot;F.E.2&quot; designation refers to three quite distinct types, with only the same broad layout in common, the F.E.2 (1911), the F.E.2 (1913), and finally the famous wartime two-seat fighter and general-purpose design, the F.E.2 (1914). This last aircraft was the one that went into production and had three main variants, the F.E.2a, F.E.2b, and the F.E.2d. As if this wasn&#x27;t enough, there is the F.E.2c; this was a generic description rather than a subtype proper, and refers to several one-off conversions of F.E.2b&#x27;s that experimentally reversed the seating positions of the pilot and the observer.

The B.E.1 was basically the prototype for the early B.E.2 but the B.E.2c was almost a completely new aeroplane, with very little common with the earlier B.E.2 types apart from engine and fuselage. On the other hand, the B.E.3 to the B.E.7 were all effectively working prototypes for the B.E.8 and were all very similar in design, with progressive minor modifications of the kind that many aircraft undergo during a production run. The B.E.8a was at least as different from the B.E.8 as the B.E.7 was.

The S.E.4a had nothing in common at all with the S.E.4, while the S.E.5a was simply a late production S.E.5 with a more powerful engine.

Several early RAF designs were officially &quot;reconstructions&quot; of existing aircraft because the Factory did not initially have official authority to build aircraft to their own design. In most cases, the type in question used no parts whatever from the wreck, in some cases, not even the engine.

===Controversy===
At the time of the &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot; in 1915, there was a press campaign against the standardisation of Royal Aircraft Factory types in the Royal Flying Corps, allegedly in favour of superior designs available from the design departments of private British firms. This slowly gained currency, especially because of the undeniable fact that the B.E.2c and B.E.2e were kept in production and in service long after they were obsolete and that the B.E.12 and B.E.12a were indisputable failures. Some of this criticism was prejudiced and ill-informed.

Some aviation historians continue to perpetuate the resulting belittling of the important experimental work of the Factory during this period, and the exaggeration of the failings of Factory production types, several of which were described in sensationally derogatory terms.

A modern, rather more &quot;pro-factory&quot; point of view, can be found in several of the volumes of &quot;War Planes of the First World War&quot;, by J.M. Bruce—MacDonald, London, 1965.

==Superintendents==

The Superintendents of the School of Ballooning were James Templer (1878–1906) and John Capper (1906 – 1909). The following have served as Superintendents of the Royal Aircraft Factory / Establishment:

*Mervyn O&#x27;Gorman (1912–1916) - Also Superintendent of the Balloon Factory from 1909 to 1912
*Henry Fowler (1916–1918)
*Sidney Smith (1918-)

==Changes==

After the end of the First World War, the design and development of aircraft types ended – although work continued on general research and the development of missiles. Research included wind tunnel testing and other aeronautical research, areas which offered rare opportunities for women in STEM fields at this time with examples including Frances Bradfield who worked at the RAE for her entire career from 1919 to her retirement; Muriel Glauert (née Barker) joined in 1918 as a researcher working in aerodynamics and Beatrice Shilling who went on to invent Miss Shilling&#x27;s orifice, to improve the engine performance of RAF Hurricane and Spitfire fighters during the Battle of Britain as part of wider work at the RAE on aircraft engine problems during World War II. Johanna Weber, a German mathematician who joined the RAE after World War II as part of Operation Surgeon to employ German aeronautical researchers and technicians and bring them to the UK, to prevent their technical knowledge falling into the hands of the Soviet occupying forces in Germany.

In 1930 the RAE developed the Robot Air Pilot, an autopilot that used a gyro and flight controls that functioned by compressed air.

Aircraft that were developed or tested at the RAE included the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and Concorde.

===Aircraft===
* Brennan Helicopter
* RAE Conceptual low altitude tactical bomber
* RAE Hurricane
* RAE Scarab
* RAE Zephyr

===Missiles===
* RAE Target—Surface-to-surface missile project from the early 1920s.
* RAE Larynx—1927 unmanned pilotless aircraft, surface-to-surface anti-ship missile.
* Malkara missile

===Rockets===
In the late fifties and through the sixties work proceeded at the RAE on several rocket projects – all of which were eventually abandoned
* R.A.E. – Vickers Transonic Research Rocket
* Black Arrow
* Black Prince
* Black Knight
* Jaguar
* Skylark

===Space satellites===
* Orba X-2 – space satellite
* Prospero X-3 – space satellite

==Current use of the Farnborough site==
The former RAE Farnborough site is (as of 2011) occupied by:
* Farnborough Airport.
* QinetiQ.
* Housing, hotels, offices etc. The IQ Farnborough development includes several refurbished former-RAE buildings.
* The Farnborough Air Sciences Trust (FAST) museum, which has several former RAE aircraft and other exhibits.
* Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

The National Aerospace Library (NAL), located in the former Weapon Aerodynamics building (Q134 Building), has a collection of over 2,500 technical reports produced by the RAE.

===Historic structures===
The historic Farnborough factory site houses three major wind tunnels, the low-speed wind tunnel (Q121 Building), constructed during the early 1930s, the No. 2 low-speed wind tunnel (R136 Building) and the transonic wind tunnel within R133 Building, which was originally commissioned in the early 1940s as a high subsonic speed tunnel but converted during the mid-1950s. A smaller transonic tunnel is housed in R133 Building, while R52 Building contains the remaining low turbulence wind tunnel. R52 Building had previously housed two early 10 ft x 7 ft low-speed tunnels in separate bays, which were replaced by the No. 1 11.5&#x27; and 4ft x 3ft tunnels respectively. The former remains in operation at the University of Southampton. R52 building also previously contained a open jet low-speed tunnel, originally built as a sub-scale prototype for the larger 24-ft tunnel, but subsequently modified for use as a noise measurement facility. Both Q121 and R133 are now Grade I listed buildings.

To the west of the Farnborough site is the 5-metre pressurised low-speed wind tunnel, which was commissioned in the late 1970s. This facility remains in operation by QinetiQ, primarily for the development and testing of aircraft high lift systems.

==Fictional appearance==
The hero of Nevil Shute&#x27;s 1948 novel &quot;No Highway&quot; is an eccentric &quot;boffin&quot; at Farnborough who predicts metal fatigue in the United Kingdom&#x27;s new airliner, the fictional &quot;Rutland Reindeer&quot;. The Comets failed for just this reason in 1954, although in the case of the Comet I the problem was in the metal structure around the navigation windows, while the point of failure in the Reindeer aircraft was in the structure of the rear empennage/fuselage joints. A film version of the novel, &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;, appeared in 1951, starring James Stewart as the protagonist. Stewart prepared for the role by shadowing Fred Jones OBE, a co-founder of the RAE Accident Section. Jones later was head of Structures Section (formerly Airworthiness Section) from 1957 to 1980.

<text>Mladen Rudonja () (born 26 July 1971) is a Slovenian retired footballer. He most often played as a winger (usually on the left side) or striker.

==International career==
Rudonja made his debut for the Slovenia national team in a February 1994 friendly match against Georgia. Despite being an attacker, he did not score a goal for the team until his 53rd cap – in the second leg of the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying playoffs against Romania in Bucharest. The match ended with a score of 1–1, a result that was enough to secure Slovenia&#x27;s first-ever qualification for the main World Cup event. Rudonja played 65 matches for Slovenia.

==Personal life==
His son Roy is a former professional footballer.

<doc id="250145" wikidata="Q59223" url="?curid=250145" title="Zhongshan">
<text>Zhongshan ( ), alternately romanized via Cantonese as Chungshan, is a prefecture-level city in the south of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, China. As of the 2020 census, the whole city with 4,418,060 inhabitants is now part of the Guangzhou–Shenzhen conurbation with 65,565,622 inhabitants. The city-core subdistricts used to be called Shiqi or Shekki ().

Zhongshan is one of the few Chinese cities to be named after a person. It was originally named Xiangshan (, &quot;Fragrant Mountain&quot;; Cantonese: &quot;Heung-saan&quot;), but was renamed in 1925 in honor of Sun Yat-sen, who is known in China as &quot;Sun Zhongshan&quot;. Sun was the founding father of the Republic of China who is also regarded positively by the People&#x27;s Republic. He was born in Cuiheng village in Nanlang Township of what was then Xiangshan County. 
==Names==
Until 1925, Zhongshan was generally known as Xiangshan or Heung-san (Siangshan) (), in reference to the many flowers that grew in the mountains nearby. The city was renamed in honor of Sun Yat-sen, who had adopted the name Zhongshan. Sun is considered by both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China to be the &quot;Father of Modern China&quot;, and was from Cuiheng village – now part of Nanlang Town in Zhongshan.

==History==

Thousands of years ago, much of the Zhongshan area lay within the Pearl River estuary, with only scattered islands above the surface. Gradually from south to north, the area filled in with alluvial silt and became dry land. The northern parts of today&#x27;s Zhongshan did not fill in until the time of the Ming dynasty.

The Zhongshan area was part of an extended Dongguan County during the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), and was a significant sea salt producer. In 1082, during the Northern Song dynasty, a fortified settlement called Xiangshan was founded in the area, marking the first official use of the name by which it would be known throughout most of its modern history. The prosperous settlement was then upgraded to a county in 1152. After the collapse of the Southern Song dynasty, many descendants of Song court officials, including members of the imperial family, settled in Xiangshan. Significant land formation in the area of Zhongshan occurred since the Ming dynasty. Under the Qing dynasty, embankments were built to prevent flooding in the new alluvial lands, and the area of cultivation was extended.

Much of the First Opium War took place in and around Xiangshan. In 1839, the official Lin Zexu arrived in Xiangshan and ordered the expulsion of Sir Charles Elliot and other British traders from the area. Qing dynasty soldiers resisted British attacks on the area in 1840, but were ultimately overwhelmed.

After the Opium Wars opened the region to foreign influence, a number of Xiangshan residents, including Sun Zhongshan (Yatsen), left to study overseas and were among the creators of modern China. Xiangshan was one of the first counties in China liberated as part of the Xinhai Revolution. After Sun Zhongshan&#x27;s death in 1925, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Republic of China decided to memorialize Sun by renaming his county of birth from Xiangshan to Zhongshan.

Nationalist and Communist units launched guerrilla attacks on Japanese occupancy forces and their Collaborators beginning in 1942. On August 15, 1945, Japanese forces declared an unconditional surrender, and Zhongshan was liberated.

Zhongshan was the scene of fighting during the Chinese Civil War and was held for much of the war by Nationalists. On October 30, 1949, however, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army defeated Nationalist forces in Zhongshan, and the county came under the control of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In 1983, Zhongshan was elevated in administrative status from a county to a county-level city under the administration of Foshan. In 1988 Zhongshan became a prefecture-level city.

==Geography and climate==
Zhongshan is located along the west side of the mouth of the Pearl River, directly opposite Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It lies south of Guangzhou and Foshan and north of Zhuhai and Macau. The northern part of Zhongshan, including most of the urbanized area, lies on the alluvial plains of the Pearl River Delta, while the southern part of the city&#x27;s territory reaches into a range of coastal hills.

The most notable of these are the Wugui Hills (). The city&#x27;s current geography is typical of southern China: numerous steep mountains and hills with alluvial plains in between down to the coastline. The main summit of the Wugui Hills is the highest point in the city, at above sea level.

Like nearly all of southern China, Zhongshan&#x27;s climate is warm and humid most of the year, with an average temperature of and of rainfall each year. Southern China experiences fairly frequent typhoons and thunderstorms, and most rain falls between April and September.


==Cityscape==
Zhongshan is a city of numerous leafy parks, wide boulevards, and monuments. Notable sights include:

* Sunwen Road West (or Sunwen Xilu) in Zhongshan Old Town, a pedestrian mall lined with dozens of restored buildings from the colonial period in treaty port style. Several of these buildings were built in the 1920s.
* The seven-story Fufeng Pagoda, built in 1608 and visible from all over the city, is on a hill in Zhongshan Park, which abuts the western end of Sunwen Road West immediately to its north. A Sun Yat-sen memorial pavilion stands near the pagoda.
* Sunwen Memorial Park, at the southern end of Xingzhong Road, is the site of the largest bronze sculpture of Sun Yat-sen in the world.
Zhongshan, like many cities in China, has a rapidly changing cityscape with many new buildings under construction. Currently, the tallest completed buildings in the city are the two Zhongshan International Finance Center Towers. Tower 1 and Tower 2 both reach a height of and are 55 stories tall. These will be eclipsed by the Perfect Eagle Golden Square tower, which will reach , with an expected completion date in 2018. The International Trade Center in Guzhen Town, expected to be completed in 2019, will reach a height of with 65 floors.

==Administration==
Zhongshan is a prefecture-level city of the Guangdong province. An uncommon administrative feature is that it has no county-level division, but the municipal government does group the 24 township-level divisions into five district areas. The city government directly administers 8 Subdistricts and 15 towns:


* Cuiheng New Area ()

==Language==
Although the main ethnic group in Zhongshan is Han Chinese, there is no one dominant language or dialect spoken making Zhongshan one of the most diverse cities in China. Dialects spoken in the city ranging from the more common Yue, Hakka, and Min dialects to the more local Shiqi, Shatian, Longdu, Nanlang, Sanxiang, Guzhen, Sanjiao, and Zhangjiabian dialects as well as Wuiguishan, the only Hakka dialect in the city. The most common language, however, is Cantonese.

* Guzhen dialect – Guzhen Town
* Sanjiao dialect – Sanjiao Town

==Economy==
===Primary industries===
Primary productions are agricultural, such as rice, lychee, banana, and sugar cane. Added to this, horticulture in Xiaolan Town is famous throughout southern China for its blooming chrysanthemum and chickens.

===Manufacturing industries===
Zhongshan, Dongguan, Nanhai, and Shunde are dubbed the &#x27;Four Little Tigers&#x27; in Guangdong. The proximity of Zhongshan to Hong Kong and Macau is an advantage to its economic development, especially in manufacturing.

In the 1980s, Zhongshan had a relatively developed state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector that was used to stimulate Township and Village Enterprises (TVE) development in the countryside. Currently, the SOE sector is much weaker, and the economy is dominated by foreign investment and TVEs, and by specialized &#x27;manufacturing towns&#x27;. Each of these towns specializes in making a particular product. Most of the towns have earned a reputation as leading manufacturers in their pillar industries.

These specialized manufacturing towns include:
* Dachong Town for mahogany furniture
* Dongfeng Town for electric household appliances
* Guzhen Town for lighting fixtures
* Huangpu Town for food processing
* Shaxi Town for casual wear manufacturing
* Xiaolan Town for locks and hardware, as well as for electronic acoustics products

The government of Zhongshan encourages &quot;Research and Design&quot; in the region by setting up national level research centres and specialized industrial regions. For example, the Zhongshan National Torch High-Tech Industrial Development Zone () was established in 1990 in the east of the city by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the governments of Guangdong province and Zhongshan. Zhongshan Port, which ranks among the top 10 ports nationwide in container-handling capacity, is in the zone. Since 2001, it has included the Zhongshan Electronic Base of China () for its reputation in the electronic acoustics industry. Following possible development in Nansha, the city considers its eastern part, of which of land is available, a focus of future development.

Currently, the city is trying to re-organize its fragmented industrialization. Meanwhile, the light and labour-intensive industry characteristic of the local economy faces the problem of a shortage of land in Zhongshan.

==Tourism, recreation and leisure==
* Two natural hot spring resorts are located in Sanxiang Town, such as the national own firm Zhongshan Hot Springs Resort, which is ranked top 10 hot spring resorts in China because there is a rare hot spring reservoir in the Pearl River Delta.
The World Lamp King Museum, a lamp museum in the form of a giant lamp scheduled to open in 2015, will be a major tourist attraction.
* Former Residence of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Museum: The former residence of Sun Zhongshan is at the center of the Memorial Museum, located in the village of Cuiheng.
* Xiaolan: Many houses in the town of Xiaolan have garden pavilions dedicated to the cultivation of chrysanthemums. Roofs and balconies, streets and lanes feature countless varieties of chrysanthemum plantings.
Zhongshan is home to a number of forest parks which are designed to protect the natural features of the land and offer visitors a chance to get closer to nature. Zhongshan Tianxin Forest Park () was opened in 2015 as part of the city&#x27;s &quot;green lung&quot; initiative.

<doc id="250152" wikidata="Q1891628" url="?curid=250152" title="Manuel Lisa">
<text>Manuel Lisa, also known as Manuel de Lisa (September 8, 1772, in New Orleans Louisiana (New Spain) – August 12, 1820, in St. Louis, Missouri), was a Spanish citizen and later American citizen who, while living on the western frontier, became a landowner, merchant, fur trader, United States Indian agent, and explorer. Lisa was among the founders, in St. Louis, of the Missouri Fur Company, an early fur trading company. Manuel Lisa gained respect through his trading among Native American tribes of the upper Missouri River region, such as the Teton Sioux, Omaha and Ponca.

After being appointed, as US Indian agent, during the War of 1812, Lisa used his standing among the tribes to encourage their alliance with the United States and their warfare against tribes allied with the United Kingdom. While still married to a European-American woman in St. Louis, where he kept a residence, in 1814 Lisa married Mitane, a daughter of Big Elk, the principal chief of the Omaha people, as part of securing their alliance. They had two children together, whom Lisa provided for equally in his will with his children by his other marriage.

==Early life==
Little is known of the early life of Manuel Lisa, but he is believed to have been born in 1772 in New Orleans, then part of Spanish Louisiana. It was ceded to Spain by France after the British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, when the British gained Florida in exchange with Spain for French lands west of the Mississippi River. His father, Christoval de Lisa, was born in Murcia, Spain, while his mother, Maria Ignacia Rodriguez, was born to a colonial family in St. Augustine, Florida. It is likely that Christoval came to Spanish Louisiana in the service of the governor Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly, who started his tenure in 1769. Manuel had at least one elder brother, Joaquin Lisa, who worked with him in his early trade expeditions.

By 1789, Manuel Lisa and his brother Joaquin were trading on the Mississippi River in New Madrid, Missouri; the next recorded mention of Manuel Lisa was again in New Madrid, after he had returned from trading along the Wabash River.

==Marriage and family==
By 1796 Lisa had married Polly Charles Chew (d. 1817), a young widow from New Orleans. After he obtained a land grant in the Missouri area, they relocated to St. Louis, which was the center of the region&#x27;s thriving fur trade, established primarily by French colonists, some also from New Orleans. Polly Lisa lived in the city with their three children while her husband made his long expeditions to various Indian territories on the Upper Missouri River.

After founding Fort Lisa about 1813, a post in what is now part of Omaha, Nebraska, Lisa worked to gain alliances with local tribes, such as the Omaha. After being appointed US Indian agent in the area by the governor of the Missouri Territory, in 1814 Lisa married Mitane, a daughter of Big Elk, the principal chief of the Omaha until 1846. Both sides saw it as a strategic alliance. Lisa and Mitane had two children together, Rosalie and Christopher, born in subsequent years after Lisa&#x27;s expeditions and wintering over at Fort Lisa.

&quot;Kinship and ties of affinity proved more than merely useful to the traders. They were both a source of power and a necessity if one was to achieve success in the trade.&quot; Only traders were accepted for marriages to high-status women, such as the daughters of chiefs, as the chiefs saw such marriages as a way to increase their own power. As the Omaha had a patrilineal system, the children of Lisa and Mitane were considered &quot;white&quot; as their father was &quot;white&quot;. The tribe protected them, but unless such mixed-race children were officially adopted by a man of the tribe, they were not considered Omaha and had no real place in a gens (clan), the basic kinship unit.

Polly Chew Lisa died in 1817 in St. Louis while Manuel Lisa was away on an expedition. After his return the following year, on August 5, 1818, Lisa married the widow Mary Hempstead Keeny, a sister of his friend, the attorney Edward Hempstead. As a widow, she had migrated with her parents and siblings from Connecticut to join four brothers already in Missouri.

In 1819 Lisa took his new wife Mary with him for his next expedition and winter at Fort Lisa, Nebraska. He tried to gain custody of his children with Mitane, who let him take Rosalie back to St. Louis the next year for education at a Catholic school, but refused to let him have Christopher. Lisa included provisions for both Rosalie and Christopher in his will, along with his children by his first wife Polly Chew. Only Rosalie Lisa Ely ( – 1904) survived to adulthood, married and had children.

==Land and purchases of enslaved people in the Louisiana Territory==
In 1799, Manuel Lisa requested a land grant; according to his letter to the Spanish governor, Manuel wanted it &quot;upon one of the banks of the River Missouri, in a place where may be found some small creek emptying into the said river, in order to facilitate the raising of cattle, and, with time, to be able to make shipments of salted and dried meat to the capital. After being awarded the grant, Manuel Lisa and his wife relocated to St. Louis, where they purchased a home on Second Street near the Mississippi River. In the late 1790s and early 1800s, Lisa purchased numerous enslaved people. 

==Early trade expeditions==
Lisa likely moved to St. Louis to enter the fur trade, the major part of the regional economy. By 1802, he had obtained a trade monopoly from French officials (the territory had traded hands again) with the Osage Nation. (The monopoly had formerly been held by Auguste Chouteau, a French colonist and first settler of St. Louis). But, after the Louisiana Purchase and annexation of the territory by the United States, Lisa&#x27;s relationship with the new government officials was not as strong. He competed with Pierre Chouteau, a prominent member of the founding family, who had gained a position as a U.S. government Indian agent; Chouteau and his brother had gained their wealth and social positions through the fur trade and as merchants.

Lisa had difficult relations with James Wilkinson, then-governor of U.S. Louisiana Territory. Later found to have been a secret agent of the Spanish Crown, Wilkinson denied Lisa&#x27;s requests to establish trade routes to Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was still under Spanish colonial rule. In 1806, Wilkinson warned Zebulon Pike, undertaking Pike&#x27;s Expedition, to prevent Lisa&#x27;s efforts to make business connections to Santa Fe.

Having been stymied by the government and the Chouteau family, Lisa began organizing a trade expedition to the upper Missouri River region. On the first expedition, which departed in April 1807, Lisa and his company of 42 men (including John Colter, George Drouillard or Benito Vázquez) moved up the Missouri until they reached the mouth of the Yellowstone River. After ascending the Yellowstone some , Lisa established a trading post on November 21 at the mouth of the Bighorn River in present-day Montana. Named Fort Raymond for his son (also known as Fort Manuel), it was the first such outpost in the upper Missouri region.

Lisa assigned John Colter of his party to explore the region and trade with the nearby Blackfeet tribe. During his exploration, Colter became the first known European to visit what is now known as Yellowstone National Park; he reported on what was named the eponymous Colter&#x27;s Hell.

In July 1808, after a successful trading season, Lisa departed Fort Raymond, leaving behind a small party of men for the winter. While operations from the area were profitable for Lisa, the outpost suffered frequent attacks by the Blackfeet. During these years of Lisa&#x27;s expeditions to the upper Missouri, his wife Polly and children stayed in St. Louis.

==Creation of the Missouri Fur Company==
Upon his return to St. Louis in August 1808, Lisa established the Missouri Fur Company (sometimes referred to as the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company), a joint venture with Jean Pierre Chouteau, Pierre Chouteau, Jr., William Clark, Andrew Henry, Francois Marie Benoit, and other prominent St. Louis fur traders. Jean Pierre Chouteau had also come from New Orleans, so the two men had ties to its French and Spanish Creole community. The company was created as a temporary trust by its founders, designed to either expire or reorganize after three years.

In the spring of 1809, Lisa returned to Fort Raymond with a major expedition, made up of 350 men, about half of whom were Americans, the rest French Canadians and Creoles. They had 13 barges and keel-boats loaded with food, munitions, and articles suitable for the Indian trade, and the trip up the Missouri River was slow. Lisa transferred the fort&#x27;s contents to the new company, and abandoned the isolated post.

Directing the large force of men, Lisa built the first Fort Lisa (also called Fort Manuel) near what is now Bismarck, North Dakota. It was near a &quot;Gros Ventres&quot; village between the mouth of the Little Missouri and the Knife rivers. After the new fort was constructed, Lisa returned to St. Louis in October 1809. The next year, he ascended the river to Fort Lisa and conducted more trading operations. He returned to St. Louis in the autumn of 1810.

In April 1811, Lisa began a final expedition of the Missouri Fur Company&#x27;s first three years; he had two goals: to locate the then-lost fur trader Andrew Henry, and to transport the remaining property from Fort Lisa to St. Louis. The expedition became famous in its day as the company&#x27;s barges heading up the Missouri overtook the rival Astor Expedition, led by William Price Hunt for the American Fur Company, which had set out three weeks earlier. Lisa remained among the Mandan and Arikara tribes until Henry came downriver, and they returned to St. Louis together at the end of 1811. In 1811 Lisa was host to the first recorded tourist to present-day South Dakota: Pittsburgh lawyer Henry Marie Brackenridge.

When the Missouri Fur Company was reorganized during the winter of 1811-1812, Lisa became more prominent among its leadership. That year he built a brick home in St. Louis as a measure of his success. (Earlier he had built a stone warehouse for his fur company, which stood until the late 1930s, when it was demolished for other development.)

In May 1812, Lisa went upriver to Fort Lisa, trading there until his return to St. Louis on June 1, 1813. Lisa happened to be at Fort Lisa in North Dakota when &quot;Sacagawea&quot;, the historic interpreter and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, died at the fort on December 20, 1812. She was buried there.

On this journey he established a new fort further downriver, also called Fort Lisa, in what is now the North Omaha area of Omaha, Nebraska. Lisa at that time became the first known United States settler of Nebraska. His outpost became among the most important in the region, and the basis for the development of the major city of Nebraska.

==War of 1812==
In June 1812 the U.S. Congress voted to declare war on the United Kingdom. After Lisa&#x27;s return to St. Louis in 1813, he heard fears expressed that British agents would encourage the upper Missouri tribes to attack settlements throughout the northern and western territories. The war disrupted the fur trade with the northern tribes on both sides of the border; in 1813 the British and American Indian allies burned Fort Lisa of North Dakota. Like other traders, Lisa had to suspend his operations for the period of the war.

Early in 1814, William Clark, governor of the Missouri Territory, appointed Lisa as US Indian Agent to the tribes located above the mouth of the Kansas River, at an annual salary of $548. Lisa set out for Fort Lisa of Nebraska, where he secured alliances between the United States and Missouri-area tribes, such as the Omaha and Ponca. He was especially effective among the Teton Sioux further upriver in present-day Minnesota, whom he organized to send war parties against tribes allied with the British. While securing these alliances, in 1814 Lisa took &quot;Mitain&quot; as a consort; she was the daughter of Big Elk, the principal chief of the Omaha people. (Lisa was still legally married to Polly, his first wife, but European-American men often took &quot;country wives&quot; among their Native American allies to build their relationships.)

Later, the U.S. government recognized Lisa, calling his efforts as a &quot;great service in preventing British influence&quot; in the northern area. After the war&#x27;s conclusion in 1815, Lisa renewed his yearly trade expeditions to the area, staying each winter at Fort Lisa, Nebraska. He eventually had two children with &quot;Mitain&quot;: Rosalie and Christopher.

==Later life==
After the war, Lisa&#x27;s reputation in St. Louis improved as a result of his success in the fur trade and having aided the Americans. In 1815, he invited 43 Native American chiefs and headmen from various tribes living between the Mississippi and Missouri to the city to strengthen their alliance with the Americans, and entertained them for about three weeks. He conducted them to Portage des Sioux to meet with the commissioners William Clark, Edwards and Auguste Chouteau to sign treaties of friendship. About two years later, he hosted another 24 chiefs from the Pawnee, Missouri and Sioux before another treaty signing.

In St. Louis, Lisa was considered an ally of the landed elite. He became more affiliated with leading American members of St. Louis, including Edward Hempstead, a land claims attorney, and Thomas Hart Benton, editor of the &quot;St. Louis Enquirer&quot;. In the fall of 1817, while the trader was on an expedition up the Missouri, his first wife Polly Lisa died.

In 1818 Lisa was with most of the residents in St. Louis who turned out to welcome the newly assigned Bishop Louis William Du Bourg. He had decided to make St. Louis the seat of the diocese of Louisiana and the Floridas. Lisa and other Creole families pledged substantial funds to build a church (now called the Old Cathedral) near the river that was fit for the diocese. After his return from that year&#x27;s expedition, on August 5, 1818, Lisa married the widow Mary Hempstead Keeny (a sister of Edward Hempstead). As a measure of Lisa&#x27;s social standing, Pierre Chouteau was a witness at his second wedding.

After living a year in St. Louis, Lisa took Mary with him for the winter of 1819-1820 to Fort Lisa in Nebraska (Mary Lisa reportedly became the first woman of European descent to travel so far up the Missouri River). When he and Mary arrived, Lisa sent his second wife &quot;Mitain&quot; away from the fort.

By the time of his 1819 expedition, Lisa had developed strong relationships with the Omaha, Ponca, Yankton and Teton Sioux, Mandan and Arikara peoples. He was instrumental in extending the &quot;commercial outreach of St. Louis&quot; to the Yellowstone and Bighorn rivers and to tribes previously more under British influence. By 1829 the Missouri Fur Company had invested capital of about $10,000, highest among the local firms.

Although Lisa returned to St. Louis in good health in April 1820, he soon became ill. The unidentified illness caused his death at Sulphur Springs (now within the city of St. Louis) on August 12, 1820. He was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery at the Hempstead family plot. Although his will provided for $2000 for each of his children upon reaching adulthood (including those by &quot;Mitain&quot;), there is no evidence that they received any money. The historian Chittenden believed Lisa left few assets to his estate.

After his death, Joshua Pilcher led the Missouri Fur Company to do business under various names until about 1830. By 1830, John Jacob Astor had gained a monopoly with his American Fur Company. As the fur trade had been declining overall with changes in taste, Pilcher dissolved the Missouri Fur Company.

== Establishments ==
Manuel Lisa was responsible for constructing at least seven forts as trading posts in the American West. They included: 
* Fort Lisa in present-day Omaha, Nebraska (1812-1820)
* Fort Mandan in present-day North Dakota (1810-1812) 
* Fort Raymond in present-day Montana (1807-1810)
* Fort Henry at 3 Forks near present-day Three Forks, Montana (1810)
* Fort Henry on the Snake River tributary called Henry&#x27;s Fork in Montana (1810-1813)
* Cedar Island in the present-day Lake Francis Case in South Dakota (1810-?)
* Fort Manuel in the present-day Lake Oahe in South Dakota (1810-?)

<text>Geometry of numbers is the part of number theory which uses geometry for the study of algebraic numbers. Typically, a ring of algebraic integers is viewed as a lattice in formula_1 and the study of these lattices provides fundamental information on algebraic numbers. initiated this line of research at the age of 26 in his work &quot;The Geometry of Numbers&quot;.
The geometry of numbers has a close relationship with other fields of mathematics, especially functional analysis and Diophantine approximation, the problem of finding rational numbers that approximate an irrational quantity.

==Minkowski&#x27;s results==

Suppose that formula_2 is a lattice in formula_3-dimensional Euclidean space formula_4 and formula_5 is a convex centrally symmetric body.
Minkowski&#x27;s theorem, sometimes called Minkowski&#x27;s first theorem, states that if formula_6, then formula_5 contains a nonzero vector in formula_2.

The successive minimum formula_9 is defined to be the inf of the numbers formula_10 such that formula_11 contains formula_12 linearly independent vectors of formula_2.
Minkowski&#x27;s theorem on successive minima, sometimes called Minkowski&#x27;s second theorem, is a strengthening of his first theorem and states that
:formula_14

==Later research in the geometry of numbers==
In 1930–1960 research on the geometry of numbers was conducted by many number theorists (including Louis Mordell, Harold Davenport and Carl Ludwig Siegel). In recent years, Lenstra, Brion, and Barvinok have developed combinatorial theories that enumerate the lattice points in some convex bodies.

===Subspace theorem of W. M. Schmidt===
In the geometry of numbers, the subspace theorem was obtained by Wolfgang M. Schmidt in 1972. It states that if &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, and &quot;L&quot;1...,&quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot; are linearly independent linear forms in &quot;n&quot; variables with algebraic coefficients and if ε&gt;0 is any given real number, then the non-zero integer points &quot;x&quot; in &quot;n&quot; coordinates with
:formula_15
lie in a finite number of proper subspaces of Q&quot;n&quot;.

==Influence on functional analysis==
Minkowski&#x27;s geometry of numbers had a profound influence on functional analysis. Minkowski proved that symmetric convex bodies induce norms in finite-dimensional vector spaces. Minkowski&#x27;s theorem was generalized to topological vector spaces by Kolmogorov, whose theorem states that the symmetric convex sets that are closed and bounded generate the topology of a Banach space.

Researchers continue to study generalizations to star-shaped sets and other non-convex sets.

<text>The Future History is a series of stories created by Robert A. Heinlein. It describes a projected future of the human race from the middle of the 20th century through the early 23rd century. The term &quot;Future History&quot; was coined by John W. Campbell Jr. in the February 1941 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Campbell published an early draft of Heinlein&#x27;s chart of the series in the May 1941 issue.

Heinlein wrote most of the &quot;Future History&quot; stories early in his career, between 1939 and 1941 and between 1945 and 1950. Most of the &quot;Future History&quot; stories written prior to 1967 are collected in &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;, which also contains the final version of the chart. That collection does not include &quot;Universe&quot; and &quot;Common Sense&quot;; they were published separately as &quot;Orphans of the Sky&quot;.

Groff Conklin called the &quot;Future History&quot; &quot;the greatest of all histories of tomorrow&quot;. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966, along with the &quot;Barsoom&quot; series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the &quot;Lensman&quot; series by E. E. Smith, the &quot;Foundation&quot; series by Isaac Asimov, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series by J. R. R. Tolkien, but lost to Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series.

==Definition==
For the most part, &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot; defines a core group of stories that are clearly within the &quot;Future History&quot; series. However, Heinlein scholars generally agree that some stories not included in the anthology belong to the &quot;Future History&quot; series, and that some that are included are only weakly linked to it.

James Gifford adds &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, which was published after &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;, and also &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;, which was not included in &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;, possibly because the collection editor disliked it or because Heinlein himself considered it to be inferior. However, he considers &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; to be a borderline case. He considers &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;, and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot; to be too weakly linked to the &quot;Future History&quot; to be included.

Bill Patterson includes &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;, on the theory that the discrepancies between it and the rest of the &quot;Future History&quot; are explained by assigning it to the same &quot;bundle of related timelines&quot; in the &quot;World as Myth&quot; multiverse. However, he lists a number of stories that he believes were never really intended to be part of &quot;Future History&quot;, even though they were included in &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;: &quot;Life-Line&quot; (which was written before Heinlein published the Future History chart; however, Lazarus Long does reference the protagonist of &quot;Life-Line&quot; and his device in &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;), &quot;The Menace from Earth&quot;, &quot;—We Also Walk Dogs&quot;, and the stories originally published in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; (&quot;Space Jockey&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Great to Be Back!&quot;, &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;, and &quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot;). He agrees with Gifford that &quot;Let There Be Light&quot; should be included. The story &quot;—And He Built a Crooked House—&quot; was included only in the pre-war chart and never since.

The Heinlein juveniles do not hew closely to the &quot;Future History&quot; outline. Gifford states that &quot;Although the twelve juvenile novels are not completely inconsistent with the &quot;Future History&quot;, neither do they form a thorough match with that series for adult readers. It is not often recognized that they are a reasonably consistent &#x27;Future History&#x27; of their own... At least one major story specified in the &quot;Future History&quot; chart, the revolution on Venus, ended up being told in the framework of the juveniles as &quot;Between Planets&quot;.&quot; The novel &quot;Variable Star&quot;, written by Spider Robinson from Heinlein&#x27;s detailed outline, incorporates some elements of both the &quot;Future History&quot; (such as references to Nehemiah Scudder) and the universe of the Heinlein juveniles (for example, torch ships and faster-than-light telepathic communication between twins). The adult short story &quot;The Long Watch&quot;, included in &quot;Future History&quot; story collections, connects to &quot;Space Cadet&quot; through the character of (John) Ezra Dahlquist, the central character of the first, memorialized in the second.

Patterson cites &quot;World as Myth&quot; as a way of accounting for the deviation of real history from Heinlein&#x27;s imagined future as well as inconsistencies between stories, writing, &quot;Heinlein in the World as Myth books redefined the Future History as a timeline (or bundle of related timelines) ... which allows the &#x27;Future History&#x27; to be a hard-edged term and yet nevertheless contain inconsistencies (i.e., any inconsistency belongs to a closely-related timeline).&quot;

==List of stories==
*All stories are also collected in The Past Through Tomorrow (1967) unless marked †

==Stories never written==
The chart published in the collection &quot;Revolt in 2100&quot; includes several unwritten stories, which Heinlein describes in a postscript. &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, about a revolution in Antarctica, would have been set in the early 21st century. Three more unwritten stories fill in the history from just before &quot;Logic of Empire&quot; in the early 21st century through the beginning of &quot;If This Goes On—&quot;. &quot;The Sound of His Wings&quot; covers Nehemiah Scudder&#x27;s early life as a television evangelist through his rise to power as the First Prophet. &quot;Eclipse&quot; describes independence movements on Mars and Venus. &quot;The Stone Pillow&quot; details the rise of the resistance movement from the early days of the theocracy through the beginning of &quot;If This Goes On—&quot;.

These stories were key points in the &quot;Future History&quot;, so Heinlein gave a rough description of Nehemiah Scudder which made his reign easy to visualize—a combination of John Calvin, Girolamo Savonarola, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, and Huey Long. His rise to power began when one of his flock, the widow of a wealthy man who would have disapproved of Scudder, died and left him enough money to establish a television station. He then teamed up with an ex-Senator and hired a major advertising agency. He was soon famous even off-world—many bonded laborers on Venus saw him as a messianic figure. He had muscle as well—a re-creation of the Ku Klux Klan in everything but name. &quot;Blood at the polls and blood in the streets, but Scudder won the election. The next election was never held.&quot; Though this period was integral to the human diaspora that would follow several hundred years later, Heinlein stated that he was never able to write them because they featured Scudder prominently; he &quot;dislike(d) him too much&quot;.

Nehemiah Scudder already appears in Heinlein&#x27;s earliest novel &quot;For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot; (written 1938–1939, though first published in 2003). Scudder&#x27;s early career as depicted in that book is virtually identical with the above—but with the crucial difference that in the earlier version Scudder is stopped at the last moment by the counter-mobilization of Libertarians, and despite mass voter intimidation carries only Tennessee and Alabama. In fact, the Libertarian regime seen in full bloom in that book&#x27;s 2086 came into being in direct reaction to Scudder&#x27;s attempt to impose puritanical mores on the entire American society.

<text>Qingdao is a prefecture-level city in the eastern Shandong Province of China. Located on China&#x27;s Yellow Sea coast, Qingdao was founded in 1891 to support coastal defence fortifications. In 1897, the city was ceded to Germany. For the Germans Qingdao (Tsingtau) was a strategic trade center, port and base for its East Asia Squadron, allowing the German navy to project dominance in the Pacific. In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Japan occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao. In 1915, China agreed to recognize Japan&#x27;s special position in the territory through what became known as the Twenty-One Demands. In 1918, the Chinese government, under the control of the warlord Duan Qirui, secretly agreed to Japanese terms in exchange for a loan. Following the First World War, during the Paris Peace Conference, Japan secured agreements with the Allied powers to recognize its claim to the areas in Shandong, which included Qingdao, previously occupied by Germany. In 1922, Shandong reverted to Chinese control following the United States&#x27; mediation during the Washington Naval Conference. Today, Qingdao is a major nodal city of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that connects Continental and East Asia with Europe. It has the highest GDP of any city in the province.

Administered at the sub-provincial level, Qingdao has jurisdiction over seven districts and three county-level cities (Jiaozhou, Pingdu, Laixi). As of the 2020 census, Qingdao built-up (or metro) area made of the seven urban districts (Shinan, Shibei, Huangdao, Laoshan, Licang, Chengyang and Jimo) was home to 7,172,451 inhabitants, making it the 15th largest city in China by population. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula and looking out to the Yellow Sea, it borders the prefecture-level cities of Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southwest.

Qingdao is a major seaport and naval base, as well as a commercial and financial center. It is home to electronics multinationals such as Haier and Hisense. The Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, links the main urban area of Qingdao with Huangdao district, straddling the Jiaozhou Bay sea areas. Its historic German-style architecture and Tsingtao Brewery, the second largest brewery in China, are legacies of the German occupation (1898–1914). Qingdao is classified as a Large-Port Metropolis.

In 2007, Qingdao was named as one of China&#x27;s top ten cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report. In 2009, Qingdao was named China&#x27;s most livable city by the Chinese Institute of City Competitiveness. In 2018, Qingdao held the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. In the 2024 Global Financial Centers Index, Qingdao ranked 31th. In 2024, Qingdao was rated as a Beta- level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

Qingdao is also one of the world&#x27;s top 50 cities for global scientific research as tracked by the Nature Index. The city was also ranked 20th globally in the &quot;Global Top 100 Science &amp; Technology Cluster Cities&quot; as of 2024. It is home to several notable universities, including the Ocean University of China, China University of Petroleum, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, Qingdao University of Science and Technology Qingdao University of Technology, and Qingdao Agricultural University.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Human settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 BC), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second-largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao&#x27;ao () when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.

===German and Japanese occupations===


In 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Qingdao (then known as &quot;Jiao&#x27;ao&quot;) a defense base against naval attacks and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. In November of that year, the Juye Incident would take place, in which three German missionaries were attacked, and two were killed. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification.

The preindustrial, waning Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81).

With an area of , it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was alternatively romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau, or Kiao-Chau in English, and Kiautschou in German; Qingdao was its administrative center. &quot;The so-called &quot;Marktstrasse&quot; (Market Street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Qingdao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.&quot;

Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of Qingdao with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later.

The area had the highest school density and the highest &quot;per capita&quot; student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.

Identified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (&quot;Reichsmarineamt&quot;) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (&quot;Reichskolonialamt&quot;). The growing Imperial German Navy based their East Asia Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning in January 1898, the marines of &quot;III. Seebataillon&quot; were based at Qingdao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on 23 September 1899, and was completed in 1904.
Before the outbreak of World War I (1914–1918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).

After a minor British naval attack on the German concession in Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao (Qingdao) after Japan&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested against Japan&#x27;s violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (4 May 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.

The city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (ROC) established in 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.

Japan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after it expanded the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939–1945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China&#x27;s coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On 2 June 1949, during the Chinese Civil War and shortly before the founding of the communist People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 October 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.

===Qingdao city planning and development===

====1898–1914====
The development of the Qingdao urban space during the German occupation (1898–1914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of mass construction projects such as wharves, the Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury as well as Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.

In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequently first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtao area and stated in 1912, &quot;I am impressed. The city is a true model for China&#x27;s future&quot;.

====1914–1922====
The development of Tsingtao urban space continued during the first Japan-occupation period (1914–1922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by the Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a &quot;New City District&quot; was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, several schools, hospitals, and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the east bay area.

====1922–1938====
The development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922–1938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for entertainment and sports were completed. By the year 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.

====1938–1945====
The development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938–1945). Japanese armed forces returned to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the city planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to actualize either, respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences, and a small number of roads and streets (Lu 2001, p. 339).

===Postwar===
After World War II, the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945; however, its headquarters were transferred to the Philippines sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the CPC-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.

Since the 1984 inauguration of China&#x27;s open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, Qingdao has rapidly developed into an ultramodern port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy&#x27;s northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call to China in more than 37 years. , , and and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).

Northern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber, and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city&#x27;s southern district.
==Administrative divisions==

The sub-provincial city of Qingdao has seven districts (区; qū) and three county-level cities (市; shì):Qingdao City, located in Shandong Province, China, is a prefecture-level city with several aliases, including &quot;Island City&quot; and &quot;Jiaozhou Bay&quot;. Qingdao is a vice-provincial-level city, a separately listed city, and recognized as a major city.

According to the approval of the State Council, Qingdao is designated as an important coastal center city and a coastal resort tourism city in China, as well as an international port city. Qingdao City administers 7 districts and 3 county-level cities. These districts include Shinan District, Shibei District, Huangdao District, Laoshan District, Licang District, Chengyang District, and Jimo District, while the county-level cities consist of Jiaozhou City, Pingdu City, and Laixi City.
Geographically, there are three districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai&#x27;an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.
* Defunct - Jiaonan city () - merged into Huangdao District (December 2012)

==Geography==

Qingdao is located on the south-facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city occupies an area totaling , and stretches in latitude from 35° 35&#x27; to 37° 09&#x27; N and in longitude from 119° 30&#x27; to 121° 00&#x27; E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is located above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain, and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8%, and 21.7%, respectively. The city has a -long coastline. Five significant rivers exceeding in length can be found in the region.

===Climate===
Qingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) and humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) regimes. Due to the direct regulation of the marine environment, the city is influenced by the southeast monsoon and the currents and water masses from the ocean, so it also has significant maritime climate characteristics. Winters range from cool to cold and windy, but are generally dry, with a January average of . Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of . Due to its proximity to the coast and location on a peninsula, compared to most inland areas of China, its spring is delayed by one month, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only ; conversely, its fall is milder than inland areas in Shandong.

<doc id="250178" wikidata="Q477645" url="?curid=250178" title="Skewes's number">
<text>In number theory, Skewes&#x27;s number is the smallest natural number formula_1 for which the prime-counting function formula_2 exceeds the logarithmic integral function formula_3 It is named for the South African mathematician Stanley Skewes who first computed an upper bound on its value.

The exact value of Skewes&#x27;s number is still not known, but it is known that there is a crossing between formula_4 and formula_5 near formula_6 It is not known whether this is the smallest crossing.

The name is sometimes also applied to either of the large number bounds which Skewes found.

==Skewes&#x27;s bounds==
Although nobody has ever found a value of formula_1 for which formula_8 Skewes&#x27;s research supervisor J.E. Littlewood had proved in that there is such a number (and so, a first such number); and indeed found that the sign of the difference formula_9 changes infinitely many times. Littlewood&#x27;s proof did not, however, exhibit a concrete such number formula_1, nor did it even give any bounds on the value.

Skewes&#x27;s task was to make Littlewood&#x27;s existence proof effective: exhibit some concrete upper bound for the first sign change. According to Georg Kreisel, this was not considered obvious even in principle at the time.

 proved that, assuming that the Riemann hypothesis is true, there exists a number formula_1 violating formula_12 below
:formula_13

Without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, later proved that there exists a value of formula_1 below
:formula_15

==More recent bounds==
These upper bounds have since been reduced considerably by using large-scale computer calculations of zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The first estimate for the actual value of a crossover point was given by , who showed that somewhere between formula_16 and formula_17 there are more than formula_18 consecutive integers formula_1 with formula_5.
Without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, proved an upper bound of formula_21. A better estimate was formula_22 discovered by , who showed there are at least formula_23 consecutive integers somewhere near this value where formula_5. Bays and Hudson found a few much smaller values of formula_1 where formula_2 gets close to formula_27; the possibility that there are crossover points near these values does not seem to have been definitely ruled out yet, though computer calculations suggest they are unlikely to exist. gave a small improvement and correction to the result of Bays and Hudson. found a smaller interval for a crossing, which was slightly improved by . The same source shows that there exists a number formula_1 violating formula_12 below formula_30. This can be reduced to formula_31 assuming the Riemann hypothesis. gave formula_32.

Rigorously, proved that there are no crossover points below formula_33, improved by to formula_34, by to formula_35, by to formula_36, and by to formula_37.

There is no explicit value formula_1 known for certain to have the property formula_8 though computer calculations suggest some explicit numbers that are quite likely to satisfy this.

Even though the natural density of the positive integers for which formula_5 does not exist, showed that the logarithmic density of these positive integers does exist and is positive. showed that this proportion is about , which is surprisingly large given how far one has to go to find the first example.

==Riemann&#x27;s formula==
Riemann gave an explicit formula for formula_2, whose leading terms are (ignoring some subtle convergence questions)

:formula_42
where the sum is over all formula_43 in the set of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

The largest error term in the approximation formula_44 (if the Riemann hypothesis is true) is negative formula_45, showing that formula_27 is usually larger than formula_2. The other terms above are somewhat smaller, and moreover tend to have different, seemingly random complex arguments, so mostly cancel out. Occasionally however, several of the larger ones might happen to have roughly the same complex argument, in which case they will reinforce each other instead of cancelling and will overwhelm the term formula_45.

The reason why the Skewes number is so large is that these smaller terms are quite a &quot;lot&quot; smaller than the leading error term, mainly because the first complex zero of the zeta function has quite a large imaginary part, so a large number (several hundred) of them need to have roughly the same argument in order to overwhelm the dominant term. The chance of formula_49 random complex numbers having roughly the same argument is about 1 in formula_50.
This explains why formula_2 is sometimes larger than formula_52 and also why it is rare for this to happen.
It also shows why finding places where this happens depends on large scale calculations of millions of high precision zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

The argument above is not a proof, as it assumes the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are random, which is not true. Roughly speaking, Littlewood&#x27;s proof consists of Dirichlet&#x27;s approximation theorem to show that sometimes many terms have about the same argument.
In the event that the Riemann hypothesis is false, the argument is much simpler, essentially because the terms formula_53 for zeros violating the Riemann hypothesis (with real part greater than ) are eventually larger than formula_54.

The reason for the term formula_55 is that, roughly speaking, formula_56 actually counts powers of primes, rather than the primes themselves, with formula_57 weighted by formula_58. The term formula_55 is roughly analogous to a second-order correction accounting for squares of primes.

==Equivalent for prime &quot;k&quot;-tuples==
An equivalent definition of Skewes&#x27;s number exists for prime &quot;k&quot;-tuples (). Let formula_60 denote a prime (&quot;k&quot; + 1)-tuple, formula_61 the number of primes formula_62 below formula_1 such that formula_64 are all prime, let formula_65 and let formula_66 denote its Hardy–Littlewood constant (see First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture). Then the first prime formula_62 that violates the Hardy–Littlewood inequality for the (&quot;k&quot; + 1)-tuple formula_68, i.e., the first prime formula_62 such that
: formula_70
(if such a prime exists) is the &quot;Skewes number for formula_71&quot;

The table below shows the currently known Skewes numbers for prime &quot;k&quot;-tuples:

The Skewes number (if it exists) for sexy primes formula_72 is still unknown.

It is also unknown whether all admissible &quot;k&quot;-tuples have a corresponding Skewes number.

Ring-necked ducks are small to medium-sized diving ducks with the following length, weight, and wingspan measurements:

* Length: 15.3–18.1 in (39–46 cm)
* Weight: 17.3–32.1 oz (490–910 g)
* Wingspan: 24.4–24.8 in (62–63 cm)

The adult male is similar in color pattern to the Eurasian tufted duck, its relative. Males are a little bit bigger than the female. It has two white rings surrounding its gray bill, a shiny black angular head, black back, white line on the wings, a white breast and yellow eyes. The adult female has a grayish brown angular head and body with a dark brown back, a dark bill with a more subtle light band than the male, grayish-blue feet and brown eyes with white rings surrounding them. Females also make a noise like &quot;&quot;. The cinnamon neck ring is usually difficult to observe, which is why the bird is sometimes referred to as a &quot;ringbill&quot;.

==Breeding and migration==
Their breeding habitat is wooded lakes or ponds in the northern United States and Canada. The main breeding area is Northwest boreal forest territories. Their breeding habits also take place in the eastern boreal region of Canada but nowhere near the same amount in the northwestern region. In the winter months they are usually found in southern North America in lakes, ponds, rivers or bays. Ring-necked duck pairs start during spring migration. Unpaired ducks showing up on breeding grounds will most likely end up being non-breeders. The pairs stay together only for reproduction, after that, they separate. The nest is bowl-shaped, built on water in dense emergent vegetation with sedges and woody plants. The female lays one egg per day until 8 to 10 eggs are laid. They are incubated 25–29 days and the female may remain with the young until they are able to fly.

==Diet==
These birds are omnivores and feed mainly by diving or dabbling at the surface. Ducklings are dependent on animal matter such as insects, earthworms, leeches, midges and snails. As they mature they tend change their diet to submerged plants such as pondweed and coontail, and emergents such as annual wild rice and snails.

==Vagrancy==
This strong migrant is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe. In Britain, occasional small flocks occur, including five at Loch Leven, Scotland in September 2003 and four at Standlake in Oxfordshire in April 2015. In Ireland one or two individuals can be seen at any time of year. Vagrant individuals also occur each year in Central America as far south as Costa Rica between October/November and May/June. They have also been reported in small numbers in Suriname and French Guiana, in northern South America.

<text>Probainognathus meaning “progressive jaw” is an extinct genus of cynodonts that lived around 235 to 221.5 million years ago, during the Late Triassic in what is now Argentina. Together with the genus &quot;Bonacynodon&quot; from Brazil, &quot;Probainognathus&quot; forms the family Probainognathidae. &quot;Probainognathus&quot; was a relatively small, carnivorous or insectivorous cynodont. Like all cynodonts, it was a relative of mammals, and it possessed several mammal-like features. Like some other cynodonts, &quot;Probainognathus&quot; had a double jaw joint, which not only included the quadrate and articular bones like in more basal synapsids, but also the squamosal and surangular bones. A joint between the dentary and squamosal bones, as seen in modern mammals, was however absent in &quot;Probainognathus&quot;.

== Discovery and naming ==
The first specimens of &quot;Probainognathus jenseni&quot; were discovered in the Chañares Formation in La Rioja Province, Argentina, by a group headed by the Harvard collector James A. Jensen. The specimens were collected north of the terminus of the Rio Chañares at the Campo de Talampaya.

&quot;Probainognathus jenseni&quot; was first described and named by the Harvard paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1970. The generic name &quot;Probainognathus&quot; means “progressive jaw” in Greek, referencing its advanced jaw articulation. The specific epithet &quot;jenseni&quot; honours James A. Jensen.

A juvenile skull (PVSJ 410), from the Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina, was assigned to cf. &quot;Probainognathus&quot; in a 1994 paper by José Bonaparte and Alfred W. Crompton. Later studies have shown that the specimen likely belongs to a cynodont more derived than &quot;Probainognathus&quot;. The specimen was sent through a CT scan at the University of Texas at Austin, and the resulting 3D model was made available to the public.

In 1994, the holotype of &quot;Probainognathus jenseni&quot;, along with several other specimens, were stolen from the National University of La Rioja in Argentina.

== Description==
&quot;Probainognathus&quot; was a small cynodont, the apparent body size of which is inconsistent across sources, ranging from being about the size of a rat, to the size of a small dog.

=== Teeth and diet ===

The diet of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; is thought to have been carnivorous or insectivorous, which can be extrapolated from its teeth. The teeth included dully-tipped, partially developed canines, postcanines, four upper incisors that were positioned vertically, and three lower incisors that leaned slightly forward. The cheek teeth were slender from the sides, but were lengthened anteroposteriorly, with several cusps along the row.

=== Brain ===
Based on an endocranial cast of &quot;Probainognathus&quot;, several details have been extrapolated about its brain. &quot;Probainognathus&quot;’ cerebral hemispheres were elongated, it had established olfactory bulbs, and a significant cerebellum and flocculi. These were among other, less pronounced, structures such as anterior colliculi. Because of these features, it has been suggested that &quot;Probainognathus&quot;’ brain had well-developed visual, auditory, motor, and body sensory systems. And, as a whole, the brain of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; indicates that it was in the process of developing endothermy.

=== Skull ===
The snout of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; extended beyond the premaxillary processes, and was very thin. The apparent fragility of this structure has led to it being broken off several specimens, and has led to an increased difficulty in studying it. There are several features that have been identified, however. The suborbital arch and the zygomatic arch were both shaped relatively sharply, and there was an extension of the squamosal posteriorly on the zygomatic arch. &quot;Probainognathus&quot; had a long secondary palate as it stretched all the way to the posterior end of the tooth row. The secondary palate was formed largely by the palatine, and it was somewhat narrow. This narrowing of the palate allowed for the conservation of space to be able to fit the back, lower postcanine teeth. Moreover, the vomer stretched posteriorly to the secondary palate, and significant pterygoid flanges were present, as well.

The skull of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; was on average around in length, and lacked the pineal foramen. The skull was broad in proportion to its length, the face was short and narrow, but its zygomatic region was relatively large, seemingly for jaw muscle attachment. The skull also possessed a double occipital condyle, which is a typical mammalian feature. In comparison to close relatives, such as &quot;Chiniquodon&quot;, the braincase of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; was broader in the parietal region, and the occipital region of the skull was deeper. Likewise, the parietals had more depth, the occipital crest was higher, and the orbits were proportionately larger relative to the rest of its head. The sagittal crest was also lengthened posteriorly, and split into the occipital crests. This led to a straighter posterior margin, and a more concave occiput in &quot;Probainognathus&quot;.

=== Jaw ===
The jaw of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; is of particular phylogenetic importance. Morphologically, the dentary made up most of the lower jaw, and it curved and extended down posteriorly to the area of the articular and jaw articulation. Correspondingly, in the upper jaw, the squamosal bone became situated next to the quadrate. Like some other cynodonts, &quot;Probainognathus&quot; possessed a double jaw joint, as indicated by a socket (glenoid) in the squamosal bone. Romer (1970) interpreted this socket as articulating with the dentary bone of the lower jaw, as seen in modern mammals and early mammaliaforms like &quot;Morganucodon&quot;. Later studies have reinterpreted the socket as articulating with the surangular, one of the postdentary bones, instead of the dentary. Once the dentary-squamosal articulation became established, the former bones involved in jaw articulation, the articular and quadrate, could become integrated into the inner ear as the malleus and incus, respectively. This had not yet happened in the case of &quot;Probainognathus&quot;, but the reduced size of the quadrate, as well as its loose association with the squamosal and proximity to the stapes indicates the quadrate to incus process was underway.

The jaw of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; is suggested to have had mammal-like soft tissue features. The jaw muscles in &quot;Probainognathus&quot; are thought to have been positioned farther forward, with the masseter splitting into two separate muscles: the superficial masseter and the deep masseter.

== Classification ==
When Romer first described &quot;Probainognathus&quot; in 1970, he assigned it to the family Chiniquodontidae based on the animal&#x27;s overall similarities with that group. In a 1973 paper, he decided that &quot;Probainognathus&quot; was distinct enough from other chiniquodontids to deserve its own family, and thus Probainognathidae was erected. In 2016, a second probainognathid, &quot;Bonacynodon&quot;, was described from Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses have generally found probainognathids to be early-diverging members of the clade Probainognathia, being closer to mammals than to the traversodontids and other cynognathians.

The cladogram below is from a 2023 paper by Stefanello &quot;et al.&quot;, and shows the position of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; within Probainognathia.

== Paleoecology ==
&quot;Probainognathus&quot; was collected from the Chañares Formation in La Rioja Province, Argentina. This locale is known for its preservation of tetrapods, which are largely fossilized in volcanic concretions. When &quot;Probainognathus&quot; inhabited this area, it is thought to have been a lacustrine region within a rift basin that got a large influx of sedimentary debris and volcanic ash.

Various pieces of evidence suggest tetrapod mass mortality was the cause of death in the Chañares Formation. Fossils of both young and adult specimens were found at this locale, and these are not limited to &quot;Probainognathus&quot;, but rather represent many taxa that fell victim to the event. There is also an unusual concentration of herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores in this formation. Numerous fossils of each type were found in close proximity to one another, despite the fact that this intermingling would normally be uncommon. It has, subsequently, been suggested that this unusual distribution of specimens could be due to the death event leaving these animals stranded with no other place to go, perhaps along a waterfront of some kind. The evidence at hand, especially the nature of volcanic preservation, has led to the postulation that volcanism played a role in the death event in some capacity. Suggested events include a large outpouring of ash, lethal gas surges, or, more likely, volcanism-induced flooding. Volcanic activity may have caused damming or other water diversion, which led to major widespread flooding in the area, and the death of &quot;Probainognathus&quot; and other tetrapods. Unfortunately, however, it remains uncertain whether volcanism was the direct cause of this major death event, or if it just aided in preservation after the fact.

<text>Lepagia is an extinct genus of poorly known carnivorous cynodonts, which lived during the Upper Triassic in Europe. Partly due to the paucity of remains (it is only known from teeth) the precise affinities of this genus are unclear. It seems reasonably closely related to &quot;Probainognathus&quot;, a somewhat earlier inhabitant of South America. The genus &quot;Lepagia&quot; (&quot;for Lepage&quot;) was named by Hahn, Wild and Wouters in 1987 based on a single species.

Fossil remains of the species &quot;Lepagia gaumensis&quot; have been found in the Norian (late) - Rhaetian (early) (Upper Triassic)-age strata from Habay-la-Vielle, Hallau, Saint-Nicolas-de-Port in Belgium, Switzerland and France.

The holotype is at the Institut royal des Sciences naturelles de Belgique (Royal Institute of Natural Sciences of Belgium) in Brussels. These teeth are 2 – 3 mm in length. The postcanines have long and narrow crowns with three to five cusps, the central one of which is dominant and points straight upwards. The root is vaguely rectangular, with the lower portion tapering. There are no distinctive wear facets, but the separation of crown and root are clear. Sometimes the crown is larger and sometimes the root.

Godefroit and Battail cite similarities and differences with and to both Chiniquodontidae and Dromatheriidae and leave the systematical placement open.

<text>Sexual behaviors in children are common, and may range from normal and developmentally appropriate to abusive. These behaviors may include self-stimulation, interest in sex, curiosity about their own or other genders, exhibitionism (the display of one&#x27;s body to another child or an adult), voyeurism (attempts at seeing the body of another child or an adult), gender role behaviors, and engagement in interpersonal sexual acts.

More than 50% of children will engage in a form of sexual behavior before the age of 13 (around puberty), including sexual experiences with other children. These experiences can include fondling, interpersonal genital exploration and masturbation; while intrusive contact (digital penetration, oral or genito-genital contact, etc) is more rare.

== Sexual behaviors ==

===Curiosity===
Although there are variations between individual children, children are generally curious about their bodies and those of others and explore their bodies through explorative sex play. &quot;Playing doctor&quot; is one example of such childhood exploration; such games are generally considered to be normal in young children. Child sexuality is considered fundamentally different from adult sexual behavior, which is more goal-driven. Among children, genital penetration and oral-genital contact are very uncommon, and may be perceived as imitations of adult behaviors. Such behaviors are more common among children who have been sexually abused.

According to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report:
*Children less than four years old will sometimes touch their own private parts or look at the private parts of others.
*Between ages four and six, some children may become more actively curious, attempting to see others dressing or undressing or will perhaps &quot;play doctor&quot;.
*Between ages six and twelve, children may start to expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They may develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers. 
*From the ages of three to seven, children are typically curious about where babies come from. They may explore other children&#x27;s and adults&#x27; bodies out of curiosity and also begin to have a sense of learned modesty and of the differences between private and public behaviors. For some children, genital touching increases, especially when they are tired or upset.

=== Masturbation ===
Some children partake in genital stimulation at an early age. By the age of 8 or 9, some children become aware that sexual arousal is a specific type of erotic sensation and will seek these pleasurable experiences through various sights, self-touches, and fantasy.

=== Interpersonal sexual experiences ===
Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends. Sex play with others usually decreases as children go through their elementary school years, yet they still may possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, escalating in puberty (roughly the teenage years) when the main surge in sexual interest occurs.

Mutual masturbation or other sexual experimentation between adolescents of similar ages may also occur, though cultural or religious coercion may inhibit or encourage concealment of such activity if there is negative peer pressure or if authority figures are likely to disapprove.

A 1997 study based on limited variables found no correlation between early childhood (age 6 and under) peer sexual play and later adjustment. The study notes that its results do not demonstrate conclusively that no such correlation exists. The study also does not address the question of consequences of intense sexual experiences or aggressive or unwanted experiences.

A Finnish study found that 2.4% of its respondents had sexual experiences with someone at least five years older during childhood. The disclosure of such experiences to adults or peers was conditioned largely by whether violence was employed during the act and the quality of the experience (participants who did not label the experience as abuse, which represented 51% of the sample, were less likely to report it to adults, but not peers).

=== Discovery of sex differences ===

With the passage of time, children become more aware of sex differences, and tend to choose same-sex friends and playmates, sometimes disparaging the opposite sex. Children may drop their close attachment to their opposite-sex parent and become more attached to their same-sex parent.

During this time, children, especially girls, show increased awareness of social norms regarding sex, nudity, and privacy. Children may use sexual terms to test adult reaction. &quot;Bathroom humor&quot; (jokes and conversation relating to excretory functions), present in earlier stages, continues.

As this stage progresses, the choices of children picking same-sex friends becomes more marked and extends to disparagement of the opposite sex.

==Sexual development==

=== Childcare ===
In childcare settings outside the home there is difficulty in determining what behavior is normal and what may be indicative of child sexual abuse (CSA). In 2018 an extensive study of Danish childcare institutions (which had, in the prior century, been tolerant of child nudity and playing doctor) found that contemporary policy had become restrictive as the result of childcare workers being charged with CSA. However, while CSA does occur, the response may be due to &quot;moral panic&quot; that is out of proportion with its actual frequency and over-reaction may have unintended consequences. Strict policies are being implemented not to protect children from a rare threat, but to protect workers from the accusation of CSA. The policies have created a split between childcare workers who continue to believe that behaviors involving nudity are a normal part of child development and those that advocate that children be closely supervised to prohibit such behavior.

===Puberty===
== Research ==
Studies on children&#x27;s sexual behaviors are scarce. Empirical knowledge about child sexual behavior is not usually gathered by direct interviews of children, partly due to ethical consideration. Information about child sexual behavior is gathered by observing children being treated for problematic behavior, such as use of force in sex play, often using anatomically correct dolls; Recollections by adults and observation by caregivers.

Most published sexual research material emanates from the Western world.

===Early 20th century===
Until Sigmund Freud published his &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot; in 1905, children were often regarded as asexual, having no sexuality until later development. Freud was one of the first researchers to seriously study child sexuality, and his acknowledgment of its existence was a significant change. 

Aside from Freud, the modern shift from childhood sexuality being understood as a pathological concept to a normal part of child behavior was also influenced by Albert Moll, Carl Jung, William Stern and Charlotte Bühler. Although Freud is usually regarded as the central figure in the &quot;discovery of childhood sexuality&quot;, his work was influenced by an already existing discussion around this topic that started in the second half of the 19th century.

====Kinsey====
Alfred Kinsey in the Kinsey Reports (1948 and 1953) included research on the physical sexual response of children, including pre-pubescent children (though the main focus of the reports was adults). While there were initially concerns that some of the data in his reports could not have been obtained without observation of or participation in child sexual abuse, the data was revealed much later in the 1990s to have been gathered from the diary of a single pedophile who had been molesting children since 1917. This effectively rendered the data-set nearly worthless, not only because it relied entirely on a single source, but the data was hearsay reported by a highly unreliable observer. In 2000, Swedish researcher Ing-Beth Larsson noted, &quot;It is quite common for references still to cite Alfred Kinsey&quot;, due to the scarcity of subsequent large-scale studies of child sexual behavior.

==Contemporary issues==
In the latter part of the 20th century, sexual liberation probably arose in the context of a massive cultural explosion in the United States of America following the upheaval of the Second World War, and the vast quantity of audiovisual media distributed worldwide by the new electronic and information technology. Children are apt to gain access and be influenced by material, despite censorship and content-control software.

=== Sex education ===

The extent of sex education in public schools varies widely around the world, and within countries such as the United States where course content is determined by individual school districts.

A series of sex education videos from Norway, intended for 8–12 year olds, includes explicit information and images of reproduction, anatomy, and the changes that are normal with the approach of puberty. Rather than diagrams or photos, the videos are shot in a locker room with live nude people of all ages. The presenter, a physician, is relaxed about close examination and touching of relevant body parts, including genitals. While the videos note that the age of consent in Norway is 16, abstinence is not emphasized. As of 2015, however, 37 U.S. states required that sex education curricula include lessons on abstinence and 25 required that a &quot;just say no&quot; approach be stressed. Studies show that early and complete sex education does not increase the likelihood of becoming sexually active, but leads to better health outcomes overall.

=== Social media&#x27;s role on child sexuality ===

The impact of social media on adolescent sexuality is a multifaceted concern requiring ongoing research for a comprehensive understanding. Research suggests that exposure to sexual content on social media can influence adolescents&#x27; sexual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, given their vulnerable state during this developmental period when gender roles, sexual attitudes, and behaviors are actively being shaped. Studies have identified a positive association between high-frequency social media use and increased sexual risk behaviors among adolescents.

Exposure to sexual displays on social media sites has been linked to problematic beliefs and behaviors among both content creators and viewers, particularly affecting adolescents who are more susceptible to these effects and may encourage risky sexual behavior, associated with an increase in sexually transmitted infection rates and unintended pregnancies. Social media can have both positive and negative effects on the sexual orientation of children and adolescents. For instance, it may provide a safe space for sexual identity exploration and expression for LGBTQ+ youth, fostering connectivity, social support, and positive impacts on well-being. While early adopters of the LGBTQ+ identity within the youth use social media to understand their sexuality and connect with like-minded individuals, contributing to improved emotional support and development, it&#x27;s important to note that social media can also expose children to inaccurate and potentially harmful information about sexuality, perpetuate risky sexual behaviors, and provide anonymity to potential dangers, further covered in the proceeding sections.

=== Sexualization of children ===
Over recent decades, children have been subject to a premature sexualization, as indicated by a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behavior not previously normal for their age group. The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing; the lack of parental oversight and discipline; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school sex education programs.
For girls and young women in particular, studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their &quot;self-image and healthy development&quot;.

Social media has been associated with an increase in child sexual exploitation and abuse. Reports indicate that social media platforms have become a pipeline for the rapid spread of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), leading to an alarming increase in the dissemination of such content. Further, child predators use social media to identify and groom potential victims, and the closed or private social media groups enable them to connect with like-minded peers and trade tips on how to secretly record and share CSAM.

===Child sexual abuse===

Child sexual abuse is defined as an adult or older adolescent having a sexual relationship with a child. Effects of child sexual abuse include clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, propensity to further victimization in adulthood, and physical injury to the child, among other problems.

Child sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest, and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma, especially in the case of parental incest.

Children who have been the victim of child sexual abuse sometimes display overly sexualized behavior, which may be defined as expressed behavior that is non-normative for the culture. Typical symptomatic behaviors may include excessive or public masturbation and coercing, manipulating or tricking other children into non-consensual or unwanted sexual activities, also referred to as &quot;child-on-child sexual abuse&quot;. Sexualized behavior is thought to constitute the best indication that a child has been sexually abused.

Children who exhibit sexualized behavior may also have other behavioral problems. Other symptoms of child sexual abuse may include manifestations of post-traumatic stress in younger children; fear, aggression, and nightmares in young school-age children; and depression in older children.

====Among siblings====

In 1980, a survey of 796 undergraduates, 15 percent of females and 10 percent of males reported some form of sexual experience involving a sibling; most of these fell short of actual intercourse. Approximately one quarter of these experiences were described as abusive or exploitative. A 1989 paper reported the results of a questionnaire with responses from 526 undergraduate college students in which 17 percent of the respondents stated that they had preadolescent sexual experiences with a sibling.

<doc id="250196" wikidata="Q123273" url="?curid=250196" title="Alain de Botton">
<text>Alain de Botton (; born 20 December 1969) is a Swiss-born British author and public speaker. His books discuss various contemporary subjects and themes, emphasizing philosophy&#x27;s relevance to everyday life. He published &quot;Essays in Love&quot; (1993), which went on to sell two million copies. Other bestsellers include &quot;How Proust Can Change Your Life&quot; (1997), &quot;Status Anxiety&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Architecture of Happiness&quot; (2006).

He co-founded The School of Life in 2008 and Living Architecture in 2009. In 2015, he was awarded &quot;The Fellowship of Schopenhauer&quot;, an annual writers&#x27; award from the Melbourne Writers Festival, for that work.

==Early life and family==
De Botton was born in Zürich, the son of Jacqueline (née Burgauer) and Gilbert de Botton. Gilbert was born in Alexandria, Egypt, but after being expelled under Nasser, he went to live and work in Switzerland, where he co-founded an investment firm, Global Asset Management; his family was estimated to have been worth £234 million in 1999. 

Alain de Botton&#x27;s Swiss-born mother was Ashkenazi, and his father was from a Sephardic Jewish family from the town of Boton in Castile and León. De Botton&#x27;s ancestors include Abraham de Boton. De Botton&#x27;s paternal grandmother was Yolande Harmer, a Jewish-Egyptian journalist who spied for Israel and died in Jerusalem. 

He has one sister, Miel, and they received a secular upbringing. Alain spent the first twelve years of his life in Switzerland where he was brought up speaking French and German.

==Education==
De Botton attended the Dragon School where English became his primary language. He was later sent to board and study at Harrow School, a public school in England. He has often described his childhood as that of a shy child living in boarding schools.

De Botton read history at University of Cambridge, where he was a member of Gonville and Caius College, graduating with a double starred first. He then completed an MPhil in Philosophy at King’s College London (1991-92), before studying for a PhD in French philosophy at Harvard University. However, he gave up his research to write books for the general public.

==Writing==

===Fiction===
In his first novel, &quot;Essays in Love&quot; (titled &quot;On Love&quot; in the U.S.), published in 1993, de Botton deals with the process of falling in and out of love. In 2010, &quot;Essays in Love&quot; was adapted to film by director Julian Kemp for the romantic comedy &quot;My Last Five Girlfriends&quot;. De Botton wrote a sequel to &quot;Essays in Love&quot;, published in 2016, titled &quot;The Course of Love&quot;.

===Non-fiction===
In 1997 he published his first non-fiction book, &quot;How Proust Can Change Your Life&quot;, based on the life and works of Marcel Proust. It was a bestseller in both the US and UK.

This was followed by &quot;The Consolations of Philosophy&quot; in 2000. The title of the book is a reference to Boethius&#x27;s &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, in which philosophy appears as an allegorical figure to Boethius to console him in the period leading up to his impending execution. In &quot;The Consolations of Philosophy&quot;, de Botton attempts to demonstrate how the teachings of philosophers such as Epicurus, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Seneca, and Socrates can be applied to modern everyday woes. The book has been both praised and criticized for its therapeutic approach to philosophy.

In 2004, he published &quot;Status Anxiety&quot;.

In &quot;The Architecture of Happiness&quot; (2006), he discusses the nature of beauty in architecture and how it is related to the well-being and general contentment of the individual and society. He describes how architecture affects people every day, though people rarely pay particular attention to it. A good portion of the book discusses how human personality traits are reflected in architecture. He defends Modernist architecture, and chastises the pseudo-vernacular architecture of housing, especially in the UK. &quot;The best modern architecture,&quot; he argues, &quot;doesn&#x27;t hold a mirror up to nature, though it may borrow a pleasing shape or expressive line from nature&#x27;s copybook. It gives voice to aspirations and suggests possibilities. The question isn&#x27;t whether you&#x27;d actually like to live in a Le Corbusier home, but whether you&#x27;d like to be the kind of person who&#x27;d like to live in one.&quot; 

In &quot;The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work&quot; (2009), de Botton produced a survey of ten different jobs, including accountancy, rocket science and biscuit manufacture. The book, a piece of narrative non-fiction, includes two hundred original images and aims to unlock the beauty, interest and occasional horror of the modern world of work. After a negative review of the book by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Caleb Crain, de Botton posted a scathing &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack against Crain. He later apologized for his remarks.

In August 2009, de Botton applied to a competition advertised among British literary agents by the airport management company BAA for the post of &quot;writer-in-residence&quot; at Heathrow Airport. The post involved being seated at a desk in Terminal 5, and writing about the comings and goings of passengers over a week. De Botton was appointed to the position. The result was the book, &quot;A Week at the Airport&quot;, published by Profile Books in September 2009. The book features photographs by the documentary photographer Richard Baker, with whom de Botton also worked on &quot;The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work&quot;.

In January 2012, de Botton published &quot;Religion for Atheists&quot;, about the benefits of religions for those who do not believe in them. De Botton put it: &quot;It&#x27;s clear to me that religions are in the end too complex, interesting and on occasion wise to be abandoned simply to those who believe in them&quot;. In April 2012, he published &quot;How to Think More about Sex&quot;, one in a series of six books on topics of emotional life published by his enterprise, &quot;The School of Life&quot;. 

In October 2013, he published &quot;Art as Therapy&quot;, co-written with the Australian-Scottish art historian, John Armstrong. &quot;Art as Therapy&quot; argues that certain great works of art &quot;offer clues on managing the tensions and confusions of everyday life&quot;.

In February 2014, de Botton published his fourteenth book, a title called &quot;The News: A User&#x27;s Manual&quot;, a study of the effects of the news on modern mentality, viewed through the prism of 25 news stories, culled from a variety of sources, which de Botton analyses in detail. The book delved with more rigour into de Botton&#x27;s analyses of the modern media that appeared in &quot;Status Anxiety&quot;.

===Newspapers===
De Botton used to write articles for several English newspapers and from 1998 to 2000 wrote a regular column for &quot;The Independent on Sunday.&quot;

==Lecturing, television and radio==
De Botton travels extensively to lecture. He has given lectures at TED conferences. In July 2011, he spoke in Edinburgh about &quot;Atheism 2.0&quot;, an idea of atheism that also incorporates our human need for connection, ritual and transcendence. In July 2009, he spoke at Oxford University about the philosophy of failure and success, and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments.

In 2011 he presented a series of talks for the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;A Point of View&quot;.

He has his own production company, Seneca Productions, which makes television documentaries based upon his works.

== Reception of his writing ==

De Botton has written in a variety of formats to mixed response. Positive reviews of his books attest that he has made literature, philosophy and art more accessible to a wider audience.

Negative reviews allege that de Botton tends to state the obvious and have characterized some of his books as pompous and lacking focus.

In response to a question about whether he felt &quot;pulled&quot; to be a writer, de Botton responded:So I think where people tend to end up results from a combination of encouragement, accident, and lucky break, etc. etc. Like many others, my career happened like it did because certain doors opened and certain doors closed. You know, at a certain point I thought it would be great to make film documentaries. Well, in fact, I found that to be incredibly hard and very expensive to do and I didn&#x27;t really have the courage to keep battling away at that. In another age, I might have been an academic in a university, if the university system had been different. So it&#x27;s all about trying to find the best fit between your talents and what the world can offer at that point in time.

===The School of Life===

In 2008, Alain de Botton was one of a team of writers and educators who founded The School of Life. Based in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Seoul, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, São Paulo, Berlin and Melbourne, The School of Life offers an emotional education focusing in particular on the issues of Work and Relationships. In an interview with Metkere.com de Botton said:The idea is to challenge traditional universities and reorganise knowledge, directing it towards life, and away from knowledge for its own sake. In a modest way, it’s an institution that is trying to give people what universities should I think always give them: a sense of direction and wisdom for their lives with the help of culture.

===Living Architecture===

In May 2009, de Botton launched a project called &quot;Living Architecture,&quot; which builds holiday rental houses in the UK using leading contemporary architects. These include Peter Zumthor, MVRDV, JVA, NORD and Michael and Patti Hopkins. The most recent house to be announced is a collaboration between the Turner-prize winning artist Grayson Perry, and the architecture firm FAT. The houses are rented out to the general public. De Botton, the creative director and chairman of Living Architecture, aims to improve the appreciation of good contemporary architecture—a task that serves as a practical continuation of his theoretical work on architecture in his book &quot;The Architecture of Happiness&quot;. In October 2009, he was appointed an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in recognition of his services to architecture.

===Museum displays===
In 2014, de Botton was invited by three museums—the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne and the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto—to contribute content to special exhibitions based on his work, &quot;Art as Therapy&quot;. De Botton and his colleague John Armstrong inserted captions, arranged on large Post-it-style labels designed by the Dutch graphic artist, Irma Boom, bearing slogans and commentary on exhibits throughout the Rijksmuseum.

==Personal life==
De Botton has described his relationship with his father as difficult, stating: &quot;When I sold my first bestseller (and a million dollars was peanuts for my father) he was not impressed and wondered what I was going to do with myself.&quot; When his father died, his family was left a large trust fund, although de Botton says his income is derived solely from his own activities (book sales, speaking engagements, business consulting, The School of Life). Alain&#x27;s stepmother, Janet Wolfson de Botton, is a prominent patron of the arts and competition bridge player. He married his wife, Charlotte, in 2003 and they have two sons. De Botton lives in London with his family.

In August 2014, de Botton was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<doc id="250197" wikidata="Q47774" url="?curid=250197" title="France national football team">
<text>The France national football team () represents France in men&#x27;s international football. It is controlled by the French Football Federation (FFF; ), the governing body for football in France. It is a member of UEFA in Europe and FIFA in global competitions. The team&#x27;s colours and imagery reference two national symbols: the French blue-white-red tricolour and Gallic rooster (&quot;coq gaulois&quot;). The team is colloquially known as &quot;Les Bleus&quot; (The Blues). They play home matches at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis and train at Centre National du Football in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines.

Founded in 1904, the team has won two FIFA World Cups, two UEFA European Championships, one CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, two FIFA Confederations Cups and one UEFA Nations League title. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the first World Cup in 1930. Twenty-eight years later, the team led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine finished in third place at the 1958 World Cup. France experienced much of its success in three different eras: in the 1980s, the late 1990s to early 2000s, and the late 2010s to early 2020s. In 1984, under the leadership of the three-time Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Michel Platini, France won Euro 1984 (its first official title), a CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup (1985), and reached two World Cup semi-finals (1982 and 1986).

During the captaincy of Didier Deschamps, with Zinedine Zidane being the star player, &quot;Les Bleus&quot; won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. They also won the Confederations Cup in 2001 and 2003. Three years later, France made it to the final of the 2006 World Cup, losing 5–3 on penalties to Italy. A decade later, the team reached the final of Euro 2016, where they lost 1–0 to Portugal in extra time. Two years after that, France won the 2018 World Cup, its second title in that competition. After winning the 2021 Nations League, they became the first, and so far, the only European national team to have won every senior FIFA and UEFA competition. In 2022, France reached a second consecutive World Cup final, but lost 4–2 on penalties to Argentina. France is also one of only two countries, the other being Brazil, to have won all men&#x27;s FIFA 11-player competitions at all age levels, having claimed both the FIFA World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, and Olympic title, as well as the first to complete the collection, after the U-20 national team captured the first U-20 World Cup title in 2013.

France has footballing rivalries with Belgium, England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. A bitter rivalry with Argentina also developed and intensified in the early 2020s.

==History==
===Early years (1900–1930s)===

The France national football team was created in 1904, around the time of FIFA&#x27;s foundation. The team competed in its first official international match on 1 May 1904 against Belgium in Brussels, ending in a 3–3 draw. The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first-ever home match against Switzerland. The match was played at the Parc des Princes in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 1–0 with the only goal coming from Gaston Cyprès. Due to disagreements between FIFA and the (USFSA), the country&#x27;s sports union, France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club&#x27;s appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the French Football Federation (FFF). In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the FFF.

In July 1930, France appeared in the inaugural FIFA World Cup, held in Uruguay. In their first-ever World Cup match, France defeated Mexico 4–1 at the Estadio Pocitos in Montevideo. Lucien Laurent scored the first goal in World Cup history. Conversely, France also became the first team to not score in a World Cup match after losing 1–0 to group stage opponents Argentina. Another loss to Chile resulted in the team bowing out in the group stage. The following year saw the first selection of a black player to the national team. Raoul Diagne, who was of Senegalese descent, earned his first cap on 15 February in a 2–1 defeat to Czechoslovakia. Diagne later played with the team at the 1938 World Cup, alongside Larbi Benbarek, who was one of the first players of North African origin to play for the national team. At the 1934 World Cup, France suffered elimination in the opening round, losing 3–2 to Austria. On the team&#x27;s return to Paris, they were greeted as heroes by a crowd of over 4,000 supporters. France hosted the 1938 World Cup and reached the quarterfinals, losing 3–1 to defending champions (and eventual 1938 winners) Italy.

===1950s–1980s===
France&#x27;s first &#x27;Golden Generation&#x27; in the late 1950s comprised players such as Just Fontaine, Raymond Kopa, Jean Vincent, Robert Jonquet, Maryan Wisnieski, Thadée Cisowski, and Armand Penverne. At the 1958 World Cup, France reached the semi-finals losing to Brazil. In the third-place match, France defeated West Germany 6–3 with Fontaine recording four goals, which brought his goal tally in the competition to 13, a World Cup record. The record still stands today. France hosted the inaugural UEFA European Football Championship in 1960. For the second straight international tournament, the team reached the semi-finals, but were defeated 5–4 by Yugoslavia despite being up 4–2 heading into the 75th minute. In the third-place match, France was defeated 2–0 by Czechoslovakia.

The 1960s and 1970s saw France decline significantly playing under several managers and failing to qualify for numerous international tournaments. On 25 April 1962, Henri Guérin was officially installed as the team&#x27;s first manager. Under Guérin, France failed to qualify for the 1962 World Cup and the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup. The team returned to major international play with qualification for the 1966 World Cup, but did not make it past the group stage phase of the tournament. Guérin was fired following the World Cup. He was replaced by José Arribas and Jean Snella, who worked as caretaker managers in dual roles. The two only lasted four matches and were replaced by former international Just Fontaine, who in turn was only in charge for two matches. Louis Dugauguez succeeded Fontaine and following his early struggles in qualification for the 1970 World Cup, was fired and replaced by Georges Boulogne, who could not get the team to the competition. Boulogne was later fired following his failure to qualify for the 1974 World Cup and was replaced by the Romanian Ștefan Kovács, who became the only international manager to ever manage the national team. Under the management of Kovács, France failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 1976. After two years in charge, he was sacked and replaced with Michel Hidalgo.
Under Hidalgo, France flourished, mainly due to the accolades of great players like defenders Marius Trésor and Maxime Bossis, striker Dominique Rocheteau and midfielder Michel Platini, who, alongside Jean Tigana, Alain Giresse and Luis Fernández formed the &quot;carré magique&quot; (&quot;Magic Square&quot;), which would haunt opposing defenses beginning at the 1982 World Cup, where France reached the semi-finals losing on penalties to rivals West Germany. The semi-final match-up is considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history and was marked by controversy. France finished fourth overall, losing the third-place playoff 3–2 to Poland. France earned their first major international honor two years later, winning Euro 1984, which they hosted. Under the leadership of Platini, who scored a tournament-high nine goals, France defeated Spain 2–0 in the final. Platini and Bruno Bellone scored the goals. Following the Euro triumph, Hidalgo departed the team and was replaced by former international Henri Michel. France subsequently won gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics football tournament and, a year later, defeated Uruguay 2–0 to win the Artemio Franchi Trophy, an early precursor to the FIFA Confederations Cup. Dominique Rocheteau and José Touré scored the goals. In a span of a year, France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At the 1986 World Cup, France reached the semi-finals and faced West Germany. They were defeated again by the Germans but achieved third place with a 4–2 victory over Belgium.

In 1988, the FFF opened the Clairefontaine National Football Institute. Its opening ceremony was attended by then-President of France, François Mitterrand. Five months after Clairefontaine&#x27;s opening, manager Henri Michel was fired and was replaced by Michel Platini, who failed to get the team to the 1990 World Cup.

===Zidane era and World Champions (1996–2006)===
Under Gerard Houllier, France and its supporters experienced a major disappointment in failing to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. With two matches to play, qualification had been all but secured with matches remaining against last-placed Israel and in-contention Bulgaria. However, France was upset at home by Israel 3–2 after leading 2–1 late in the match and, against Bulgaria, conceded a 90th-minute goal for a 2–1 defeat. The subsequent blame and public outcry led to the firing of Houllier and departure of several players, from the national team fold. Houllier&#x27;s assistant Aimé Jacquet was appointed as manager.
Under Jacquet, the national team achieved multiple successes. The squad comprised some experienced players from the group that had failed to reach the 1994 World Cup as well as some talented younger players, such as Zinedine Zidane. The team reached the semi-finals of Euro 1996, where they lost 6–5 on penalties to the Czech Republic. The team&#x27;s next major tournament was the 1998 World Cup, which France hosted. France went through the tournament undefeated and became the seventh nation to win the World Cup, defeating Brazil 3–0 in the final at the Stade de France in Paris. Jacquet stepped down after the country&#x27;s World Cup triumph and was succeeded by assistant Roger Lemerre who guided them through Euro 2000. Led by FIFA World Player of the Year Zidane, France defeated Italy 2–1 in the final. David Trezeguet scored the golden goal in extra time. The victory gave the team the distinction of holding both the World Cup and Euro titles, a feat first achieved by West Germany in 1974; this was also the first time that a reigning World Cup winner went on to capture the Euro. Following the result, the France national team was accorded the number one spot in the FIFA World Rankings. In the following year, the team won the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup.
After this period of achievement, France were much less successful in subsequent tournaments, and failed to make it past the group stage at the 2002 World Cup. One of the greatest shocks in World Cup history saw France defeated 1–0 by debutantes Senegal in the opening game of the tournament. France became only the second nation to be eliminated in the first round as World Cup holders, the first being Brazil in 1966. After the 2010, 2014, and 2018 World Cups, Italy, Spain, and Germany were also added to this list. After France finished bottom of the group, Lemerre was dismissed and was replaced by Jacques Santini. A full-strength team started out strongly at Euro 2004, but they were upset in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners Greece. Santini resigned as coach and Raymond Domenech was picked as his replacement. France struggled in the early qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup. This prompted Domenech to persuade several past members out of international retirement to help the national team qualify, which they accomplished following a convincing 4–0 win over Cyprus on the final day of qualifying. In the 2006 World Cup final stages, France finished undefeated in the group stage portion and advanced to the final, defeating Spain, Brazil, and Portugal in the knockout matches. France played Italy in the final. The match finished 1–1 after extra time. Zinedine Zidane had given France an early lead through a Panenka penalty which hit the crossbar before bouncing past the goal line, however Italy defender Marco Materazzi equalised from a header 7 minutes later. Italy ended up winning 5–3 on penalties to be crowned World Cup champions. The match featured a notable incident during extra time between Zidane and Materazzi in which Zidane headbutted Materazzi on the chest and was sent off. This was Zidane&#x27;s last appearance in a football match as he announced previously that he would retire from football after the 2006 World Cup.
===Decline and rebuild (2007–2015)===
France started its qualifying round for Euro 2008 strong and qualified for the tournament, despite two defeats to Scotland. After the performance in the qualifiers, France performed poorly at the final tournament, ending in last place of their group, behind Netherlands, Italy and Romania, obtaining just one point after a 0–0 draw with the Romanian side. Just like the team&#x27;s previous World Cup qualifying campaign, the 2010 campaign got off to a disappointing start with France suffering disastrous losses and earning uninspired victories. France eventually finished second in the group and earned a spot in the UEFA play-offs against the Republic of Ireland for a place in South Africa. In the first leg, France defeated the Irish 1–0 and in the second leg procured a 1–1 draw, via a controversial act by France forward Thierry Henry, to qualify for the World Cup.

In the 2010 World Cup final stages, the team continued to perform under expectations and were eliminated in the group stage, while the negative publicity the national team received during the competition led to further repercussions back in France. Midway through the competition, striker Nicolas Anelka was dismissed from the national team after reportedly having a dispute, in which obscenities were passed, with team manager Raymond Domenech during half-time of the team&#x27;s loss to Mexico. The resulting disagreement over Anelka&#x27;s expulsion between the players, the coaching staff and FFF officials resulted in the players boycotting training before their third game. In response to the training boycott, Sports Minister Roselyne Bachelot lectured the players and &quot;reduced France&#x27;s disgraced World Cup stars to tears with an emotional speech on the eve of their final group A match&quot;. France then lost their final game 2–1 to hosts South Africa and failed to advance to the knockout stage. The day after the team&#x27;s elimination, it was reported by numerous media outlets that then President of France Nicolas Sarkozy would meet with team captain Thierry Henry to discuss the issues associated with the team&#x27;s meltdown at the World Cup, at Henry&#x27;s request. Following the completion of the World Cup tournament, Federation President Jean-Pierre Escalettes resigned from his position.

Domenech, whose contract had expired, was succeeded as head coach by former international Laurent Blanc. On 23 July 2010, at the request of Blanc, the FFF suspended all 23 players in the World Cup squad for the team&#x27;s friendly match against Norway after the World Cup. On 6 August, five players who were deemed to have played a major role in the training boycott were disciplined for their roles, and Nicolas Anelka also received an 18-match ban, effectively ending the forward&#x27;s international career.

At Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine, France reached the quarter-finals, where they were beaten by eventual champions Spain. Following the tournament, coach Laurent Blanc resigned and was succeeded by Didier Deschamps, who captained France to glory in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. His team qualified for the 2014 World Cup by beating Ukraine in the play-offs. At the 2014 World Cup, France lost to eventual champions Germany in the quarter-finals courtesy of an early goal by Mats Hummels.

===Renewed success (2016–present)===
France automatically qualified as hosts for Euro 2016, advancing to the knockout stages, where they defeated the Republic of Ireland and Iceland. In the semi-final, France defeated Germany 2–0, marking their first win over Germany at a major tournament since 1958. France, however, were beaten by Portugal 1–0 in the final courtesy of an extra-time goal by Eder. 

At the 2018 World Cup, France finished top of their group to advance to the last 16. They subsequently defeated Argentina 4–3 in a thrilling match in the round of 16 and then Uruguay 2–0 to qualify for the semi-final stage, where they beat Belgium 1–0 courtesy of a goal from defender Samuel Umtiti. On 15 July, France beat Croatia in the final 4–2 to win the World Cup for the second time.

UEFA Euro 2020 was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At Euro 2020, France finished top of a group containing Germany, Portugal and Hungary, which was described by pundits as the &quot;group of death&quot;. However, they were eliminated by Switzerland in the round of 16. The Swiss had held France to a 3–3 draw in normal time before winning on penalties. France would go on to win the 2020–21 edition of the UEFA Nations League, after winning advancement to the final tournament from a group consisting of inaugural champions Portugal. France defeated Spain 2–1 in the final for their first title.

At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France looked to defend their title in Qatar. After finishing top of their group, France did manage to reach a second successive World Cup final, defeating Poland, England and Morocco in the knockout stages. However, they were defeated on penalties by Argentina after a thrilling 3–3 draw.

France qualified for UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany, where they finished second in the group stage following a victory over Austria 1–0 and two draws against Netherlands (0–0) and Poland (1–1), therefore advancing to the knockout stage. They defeated Belgium 1–0 in the round of 16 and later advanced to the semi-finals after defeating Portugal in penalties following a 0–0 draw. France were later defeated by Spain 2–1 in the semi-finals, this becoming their first defeat in regular time since losing to Germany at the 2014 World Cup.

In 2025, Didier Deschamps has confirmed he will leave when his contract expires after the 2026 World Cup.

==Home stadium==

During France&#x27;s early years, the team&#x27;s national stadium alternated between the Parc des Princes in Paris and the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. France also hosted matches at the Stade Pershing, Stade de Paris, and the Stade Buffalo, but to a minimal degree. As time passed, France began hosting matches outside the city of Paris at such venues as the Stade Marcel Saupin in Nantes, the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, and the Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg.

Following the renovation of the Parc des Princes in 1972, which gave the stadium the largest capacity in Paris, France moved into the venue permanently. The team still hosted friendly matches and minor World Cup and UEFA Euro qualification matches at other venues. France have played home matches in a French overseas department twice – in 2005 against Costa Rica in Fort-de-France (Martinique) and in 2010 against China in Saint Pierre (Réunion). Both matches were friendlies.

In 1998, the Stade de France was inaugurated as France&#x27;s national stadium ahead of the 1998 World Cup. Located in Saint-Denis, a Parisian suburb, the stadium has an all-seater capacity of 81,338. France&#x27;s first match at the stadium was played on 28 January 1998 against Spain. France won the match 1–0, with Zinedine Zidane scoring the goal. Since that match, France has used the stadium for almost every major home game, including the 1998 World Cup final.

Prior to matches, home or away, the national team trains at the INF Clairefontaine academy in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines. Clairefontaine is the national association football centre and is among 12 élite academies throughout the country. The centre was inaugurated in 1976 by former FFF president Fernand Sastre and opened in 1988. The center drew media spotlight following its usage as a base camp by the team that won the 1998 World Cup.

In the 20th and 23rd minute of an international friendly on 13 November 2015, against Germany, three groups of terrorists attempted to detonate bomb vests, at three entrances of Stade de France, and two explosions occurred. Play would continue, until the 94th minute, in order to keep the crowd from panicking. Consequently, the stadium was evacuated through the unaffected gates of the stadium away from the players benches. Due to the blocked exits, spectators who could not leave the stadium had to go down to the pitch and wait until it was safer. As a result of the attacks, both teams would remain in the stadium until the day after.

===Media coverage===
The national team has a broadcasting agreement with TF1 Group, who the Federal Council of the FFF agreed to extend its exclusive broadcasting agreement with the channel. The new deal grants the channel exclusive broadcast rights for the matches of national team, which include friendlies and international games for the next four seasons beginning in August 2010 and ending in June 2014. TF1 will also have extended rights, notably on the Internet, and may also broadcast images of the national team in its weekly program, Téléfoot. The FFF will receive €45 million a season, a €10 million decrease from the €55 million they received from the previous agreement reached in 2006.

After France won their second World Cup in 2018, M6 together with TF1 broadcast all international fixtures featuring France respectively until 2022.

===Kits and crest===
The France national team utilizes a three colour system composed of blue, white, and red. The team&#x27;s three colours originate from the national flag of France, known as the &quot;tricolore&quot;. Nevertheless, the first France shirt (as seen in their first official international match against Belgium in 1904) was white, with the two interlinked rings emblem of USFSA –the body that controlled sport in France by then– on the left.

France normally wear blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks at home, while, when on the road, the team utilizes an all-white combination or white shirts and socks with blue shorts. Between 1909 and 1914, France wore a white shirt with blue stripes, white shorts, and red socks. In a 1978 World Cup match against Hungary in Mar del Plata, both teams arrived at Estadio José María Minella with white kits, so France played in green-and-white striped shirts borrowed from Club Atlético Kimberley.
Beginning in 1966, France had its shirts made by Le Coq Sportif until 1971. In 1972, France reached an agreement with German sports apparel manufacturer Adidas to be the team&#x27;s kit provider. Over the next 38 years, the two would maintain a healthy relationship with France winning Euro 1984, the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 while wearing Adidas&#x27; famous tricolour three stripes. During the 2006 World Cup, France wore an all-white change strip in all four of its knockout matches, including the final. On 22 February 2008, the FFF announced that they were ending their partnership with Adidas and signing with Nike, effective 1 January 2011. The deal was valued at €320 million over seven years (1 January 2011 – 9 July 2018), making France&#x27;s blue shirt the most expensive sponsorship in the history of football.
The first France kit worn in a major tournament produced by Nike was the Euro 2012 strip, which was all dark blue and used gold as an accent colour. In February 2013, Nike revealed an all baby blue change strip.

In advance of France&#x27;s hosting of Euro 2016, Nike unveiled a new, unconventional kit set: blue shirts and shorts with red socks at home, white shirts and shorts and with blue socks away. The away shirt as worn in pre-Euro friendlies and released to the public also featured one blue sleeve and one red sleeve in reference to the &quot;tricolore&quot;. However, due to UEFA regulations, France was forced to wear a modified version with the sleeve colours almost desaturated in their Euro 2016 group stage game against Switzerland, which continued to be worn during 2018 World Cup qualifying.

===Nickname===
France is often referred to by the media and supporters as &quot;Les Bleus&quot; (The Blues), which is the nickname associated with all of France&#x27;s international sporting teams due to the blue shirts each team incorporates. The team is also referred to as &quot;Les Tricolores&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;Equipe Tricolore&quot; (The Tri-color Team) due to the team&#x27;s utilization of the country&#x27;s national colors: blue, white, and red. During the 1980s, France earned the nickname the &quot;Brazilians of Europe&quot; mainly due to the accolades of the &quot;carré magique&quot; (&quot;Magic Square&quot;), who were anchored by Michel Platini. Led by coach Michel Hidalgo, France exhibited an inspiring, elegant, skillful and technically advanced offensive style of football, which was strikingly similar to their South American counterparts. Despite being offence oriented, France&#x27;s defence is considered one of the best in world for their aggression and technicality. Their defence played a vital role in winning the 2018 FIFA World Cup and had earned them the title of &quot;Mur de fer&quot; (&quot;The Iron Wall&quot;).

<text>A flashbulb memory is a vivid, long-lasting memory about a surprising or shocking event. 

The term flashbulb memory suggests the surprise, indiscriminate illumination, detail, and brevity of a photograph; however, flashbulb memories are only somewhat indiscriminate and are far from complete. Evidence has shown that although people are highly confident in their memories, the details of the memories can be forgotten.

Flashbulb memories are one type of autobiographical memory. Some researchers believe that there is reason to distinguish flashbulb memories from other types of autobiographical memories because they rely on elements of personal importance, consequence, emotion, and surprise. Others believe that ordinary memories can also be accurate and long-lasting if they are highly distinctive, personally significant, or repeatedly rehearsed.

Flashbulb memories have six characteristic features: place, ongoing activity, informant, own affect, other affect, and aftermath. Arguably, the principal determinants of a flashbulb memory are a high level of surprise, a high level of consequentiality, and perhaps emotional arousal.

== Historical overview ==

The term flashbulb memory was coined by Roger Brown and James Kulik in 1977. They formed the special-mechanism hypothesis, which argues for the existence of a special biological memory mechanism that, when triggered by an event exceeding critical levels of surprise and consequentiality, creates a permanent record of the details and circumstances surrounding the experience. Brown and Kulik believed that although flashbulb memories are permanent, they are not always accessible from long-term memory. The hypothesis of a special flashbulb-memory mechanism holds that flashbulb memories have special characteristics that are different from those produced by &quot;ordinary&quot; memory mechanisms. The representations created by the special mechanism are detailed, accurate, vivid, and resistant to forgetting. Most of these initial properties of flashbulb memory have been debated since Brown and Kulik first coined the term. Ultimately, over the years, four models of flashbulb memories have emerged to explain the phenomenon: the photographic model, the comprehensive model, the emotional-integrative model, and the importance-driven model, additional studies have been conducted to test the validity of these models.

== Positive vs. negative==
It is possible for both positive and negative events to produce flashbulb memories. When the event is viewed as a positive event, individuals show higher rates of reliving and sensory imagery, and also showed having more live qualities associated with the event. Individuals view these positive events as central to their identities and life stories, resulting in more rehearsal of the event, encoding the memory with more subjective clarity.

On the other hand, events seen as negative by a person have demonstrated having used more detail-oriented, conservative processing strategies. Negative flashbulb memories are more highly unpleasant and can cause a person to avoid reliving the negative event. This avoidance could possibly lead to a reduction of emotionally intense memory. The memory stays intact in an individual who experiences a negative flashbulb memory but has a more toned-down emotional side. With negative flashbulb memories, they are seen to have more consequences.

Flashbulb memories can be produced, but do not need to be, from a positive or negative event. Studies have shown that flashbulb memories may be produced by experiencing a type of brand-related interaction. It was found that brands that are well-differentiated from competitors (for example, Build-A-Bear Workshop versus KB Toys) produced a definitional flashbulb memory, but brands lacking strongly differentiated positioning do not. These &quot;flashbulb brand memories&quot; were viewed very much like conventional flashbulb memories for the features of strength, sharpness, vividness, and intensity.

== Methods ==

Research on flashbulb memories generally shares a common method. Typically, researchers conduct studies immediately following a shocking, public event. Participants are first tested within a few days of the event, answering questions via survey or interview regarding the details and circumstances regarding their personal experience of the event. Then groups of participants are tested for a second time, for example six months, a year, or 18 months later. Generally, participants are divided into groups, each group being tested at different intervals. This method allows researchers to observe the rate of memory decay, the accuracy, and the content of flashbulb memories.

== Accuracy ==

Many researchers feel that flashbulb memories are not accurate enough to be considered their own category of memory. One of the issues is that flashbulb memories may deteriorate over time, just like everyday memories. Also, it has been questioned whether flashbulb memories are substantially different from everyday memories.
A number of studies suggest that flashbulb memories are not especially accurate, but that they are experienced with great vividness and confidence. 
In a study conducted on September 12, 2001, 54 Duke students were tested for their memory of hearing the terrorist attack and their recall of a recent everyday event. Then, they were randomly assigned to be tested again either 7, 42 or 224 days after the event. The results showed that mean number of consistent inconsistent details recalled did not differ for flashbulb memories and everyday memories, in both cases declining over time. However, ratings of vividness, recollection and belief in the accuracy of memory declined only for everyday memories. These findings further support the claims that &quot;flashbulb memories are not special in their accuracy but only in their perceived accuracy.”

Many experimenters question the accuracy of flashbulb memories, but rehearsal of the event is to blame. Errors that are rehearsed through retelling and reliving can become a part of the memory. Because flashbulb memories happen only a single time, there are no opportunities for repeated exposure or correction. Errors that are introduced early on are more likely to remain. Many individuals see these events that create flashbulb memories as very important and want to &quot;never forget&quot;, which may result in overconfidence in the accuracy of the flashbulb memory.
The most important thing in creating a flashbulb memory is not what occurs at the exact moment of hearing striking news, but rather what occurs after hearing the news. The role of post-encoding factors such as retelling and reliving is important when trying to understand the increase in remembrance after the event has already taken place.

Such research focuses on identifying reasons why flashbulb memories are more accurate than everyday memories. It has been documented that the importance of an event, the consequences involved, how distinct it is, personal involvement in the event, and proximity increase the accuracy of recall of flashbulb memories.

=== Stability over time ===

It has been argued that flashbulb memories are not very stable over time. A study conducted on the recollection of flashbulb memories for the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster sampled two independent groups of subjects on a date close to the disaster, and another eight months later. Very few subjects had flashbulb memories of the disaster after eight months. Considering only the participants who could recall the source of the news, ongoing activity, and place, researchers reported that less than 35% had detailed memories. Another study examining participants&#x27; memories of the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion found that although participants were highly confident about their memories of the event, their memories were not very accurate three years after the event had occurred. A third study conducted on the O. J. Simpson murder case found that although participants&#x27; confidence in their memories remained strong, the accuracy of their memories declined 15 months after the event, and continued to decline 32 months after the event.

While the accuracy of flashbulb memories may not be stable over time, confidence in the accuracy of a flashbulb memory appears to be stable over time. A study conducted on the bombing in Iraq and a contrasting ordinary event showed no difference for memory accuracy over a year period; however, participants showed greater confidence when remembering the Iraqi bombing than the ordinary event despite no difference in accuracy. Likewise, when memories for the 9/11 World Trade Center attack were contrasted with everyday memories, researchers found that after one year, there was a high, positive correlation between the initial and subsequent recollection of the 9/11 attack. This indicates very good retention, compared to a lower positive correlation for everyday memories. Participants also showed greater confidence in memory at the time of retrieval than the time of encoding.

=== Relation to autobiographical memory ===

Some studies indicate that flashbulb memories are not any more accurate than other types of memories. It has been reported that memories of high school graduation or early emotional experiences can be just as vivid and clear as flashbulb memories. Undergraduates recorded their three most vivid autobiographical memories. Nearly all of the memories produced were rated to be of high personal importance, but low national importance. These memories were rated as having the same level of consequentiality and surprise as memories for events of high national importance. This indicates that flashbulb memories may just be a subset of vivid memories and may be the result of a more general phenomenon.

When looking at flashbulb memories and &quot;control memories&quot; (non-flashbulb memories) it has been observed that flashbulb memories are incidentally encoded into one&#x27;s memory, whereas if one wanted to, a non-flashbulb memory can be intentionally encoded in one&#x27;s memory. Both of these types of memories have vividness that accompanies the memory, but it was found that for flashbulb memories, the vividness was much higher and never decreases compared to control memories, which in fact did decrease over time.

Flashbulb memory has always been classified as a type of autobiographical memory, which is memory for one&#x27;s everyday life events. Emotionally neutral autobiographical events, such as a party or a barbecue, were contrasted with emotionally arousing events that were classified as flashbulb memories. Memory for the neutral autobiographical events was not as accurate as the emotionally arousing events of Princess Diana&#x27;s death and Mother Teresa&#x27;s death. Therefore, flashbulb memories were more accurately recalled than everyday autobiographical events. In some cases, consistency of flashbulb memories and everyday memories do not differ, as they both decline over time. Ratings of vividness, recollection and belief in the accuracy of memory, however, have been documented to decline only in everyday memories and not flashbulb memories.

The latent structure of a flashbulb memory is taxonic, and qualitatively distinct from non-flashbulb memories. It has been suggested that there are &quot;optimal cut points&quot; on flashbulb memory features that can ultimately divide people who can produce them from those who cannot. This follows the idea that flashbulb memories are a recollection of &quot;event-specific sensory-perceptual details&quot; and are much different from other known autobiographical memories. Ordinary memories show a dimensional structure that involves all levels of autobiographical knowledge, whereas flashbulb memories appear to come from a more densely integrated region of autobiographical knowledge. Flashbulb memories and non-flashbulb memories also differ qualitatively and not just quantitatively. Flashbulb memories are considered a form of autobiographical memory but involve the activation of episodic memory, where as everyday memories are a semantic form of recollections. Being a form of autobiographical recollections, flashbulb memories are deeply determined by the reconstructive processes of memory, and just like any other form of memory are prone to decay.

===Importance of an event===

Brown and Kulik (1977) emphasized that importance is a critical variable in flashbulb memory formation. In a study conducted by Brown and Kulik, news events were chosen so that some of them would be important to some of their subjects, but not to others. They found that when an event was important to one group, it was associated with a comparatively high incidence of flashbulb memories. The same event, when judged lower on importance by another group, was found to be associated with a lower incidence of flashbulb memory. The retelling or rehearsal of personally important events also increases the accuracy of flashbulb memories. Personally important events tend to be rehearsed more often than non-significant events. A study conducted on flashbulb memories of the Loma Prieta earthquake found that people who discussed and compared their personal stories with others repeatedly had better recall of the event compared to Atlanta subjects who had little reason to talk about how they had heard the news. Therefore, the rehearsal of personally important events can be important in developing accurate flashbulb memories. There has been other evidence that shows that personal importance of an event is a strong predictor of flashbulb memories. A study done on the flashbulb memory of the resignation of the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, found that the majority of UK subjects had flashbulb memories nearly one year after her resignation. Their memory reports were characterized by spontaneous, accurate, and full recall of event details. In contrast, a low number of non-UK subjects had flashbulb memories one year after her resignation. Memory reports in this group were characterized by forgetting and reconstructive errors. The flashbulb memories for Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s resignation were, therefore, primarily associated with the level of importance attached to the event.

When Princess Diana died, it was an unexpected and surprising event. It affected people across the globe. When looking at accuracy, the importance of the event can be related to how accurate an individual&#x27;s flashbulb memory is. Reports found that among British participants, no forgetting occurred over four years since the event. Events that are highly surprising and are rated as highly important to an individual may be preserved in the memory for a longer period of time, and have the qualities of recent events compared to those not as affected. If an event has a strong impact on an individual these memories are found to be kept much longer.

=== Consequence ===

It was proposed that the intensity of initial emotional reaction, rather than perceived consequence, is a primary determinant of flashbulb memories. Flashbulb memories of the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan were studied, and it was found that participants had accurate flashbulb memories seven months after the shooting. Respondents reported flashbulb memories, despite low consequence ratings. This study only evaluated the consequence of learning about a flashbulb event, and not how the consequences of being involved with the event affects accuracy. Therefore, some people were unsure of the extent of injury, and most could only guess about the eventual outcomes. Two models of flashbulb memory state that the consequences of an event determines the intensity of emotional reactions. The Importance Driven Emotional Reactions Model indicates that personal consequences determine intensity of emotional reactions. The consequence of an event is a critical variable in the formation and maintenance of a flashbulb memory. These propositions were based on flashbulb memories of the Marmara earthquake. The other model of flashbulb memory, called the Emotional-Integrative model, proposes that both personal importance and consequence determine the intensity of one&#x27;s emotional state. Overall, the majority of research found on flashbulb memories demonstrates that consequences of an event play a key role in the accuracy of flashbulb memories. The death of Pope John Paul II did not come as a surprise but flashbulb memories were still found in individuals who were affected. This shows a direct link between emotion and event memory, and emphasizes how attitude can play a key factor in determining importance and consequence for an event. Events being high in importance and consequence lead to more vivid and long-lasting flashbulb memories.

===Distinctiveness of an event ===

Some experiences are unique and distinctive, while others are familiar, commonplace, or are similar to much that has gone on before. Distinctiveness of an event has been considered to be a main contributor to the accuracy of flashbulb memories. The accounts of flashbulb memory that have been documented as remarkably accurate have been unique and distinctive from everyday memories. It has been found that uniqueness of an event can be the best overall predictor of how well it will be recalled later on. In a study conducted on randomly sampled personal events, subjects were asked to carry beepers that went off randomly. Whenever the beeper sounded, participants recorded where they were, what they were doing, and what they were thinking. Weeks or months later, the participants&#x27; memories were tested. The researchers found that recall of action depends strongly on uniqueness. Similar results have been found in studies regarding distinctiveness and flashbulb memories; memories for events that produced flashbulb memories, specifically various terrorist attacks, had high correlations between distinctiveness and personal importance, novelty, and emotionality. It has also been documented that if someone has a distinctive experience during a meaningful event, then accuracy for recall will increase. During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, higher accuracy for the recall of the earthquake was documented in participants who had distinctive experiences during the earthquake, often including a substantial disruption in their activity.

===Personal involvement and proximity===
It has been documented that people that are involved in a flashbulb event have more accurate recollections compared to people that were not involved in the event. Recollections of those who experienced the Marmara earthquake in Turkey had more accurate recollections of the event than people who had no direct experience. In this study, the majority of participants in the victim group recalled more specific details about the earthquake compared to the group that was not directly affected by the earthquake, and rather received their information about it from the news. Another study compared Californians&#x27; memories of an earthquake that happened in California to the memories of the same earthquake formed by people who were living in Atlanta. The results indicated that the people that were personally involved with the earthquake had better recall of the event. Californians&#x27; recall of the event were much higher than Atlantans&#x27;, with the exception of those who had relatives in the affected area, such that they reported being more personally involved. The death of Pope John Paul II has created many flashbulb memories among people who were more religiously involved with the Catholic Church. The more involved someone is to a religion, city or group, the more importance and consequentiality is reported for an event. More emotions are reported, resulting in more consistent flashbulb memories.

A study (Sharot et al. 2007) conducted on the September 11 attacks demonstrates that proximity plays a part in the accuracy of recall of flashbulb memories. Three years after the terrorist attacks, participants were asked to retrieve memories of 9/11, as well as memories of personally selected control events from 2001. At the time of the attacks, some participants were in the downtown Manhattan region, closer to the World Trade Center, while others were in Midtown, a few miles away. The participants who were closer to downtown recalled more emotionally significant detailed memories than the Midtown participants. When looking solely at the Manhattan participants, the retrieval of memories for 9/11 were accompanied by an enhancement in recollective experience relative to the retrieval of other memorable life events in only a subset of participants who were, on average, two miles from the World Trade Center (around Washington Square) and not in participants who were, on average, 4.5 miles from the World Trade Center (around the Empire State Building). Although focusing only on participants that were in Manhattan on 9/11, the recollections of those closer to the World Trade Center were more vivid than those who were farther away. The downtown participants reported seeing, hearing, and even smelling what had happened. Personal involvement in, or proximity to, a national event could explain greater accuracy in memories because there could be more significant consequences for the people involved, such as the death of a loved one, which can create more emotional activation in the brain. This emotional activation in the brain has been shown to be involved in the recall of flashbulb memories.

=== Source of Information ===
When looking at the source of knowledge about an event, hearing the news from the media or from another person does not cause a difference in reaction, rather causes a difference in the type of information that is encoded to one&#x27;s memory. When hearing the news from the media, more details about the events itself are better remembered due to the processing of facts while experiencing high levels of arousal, whereas when hearing the news from another individual a person tends to remember personal responses and circumstances.

Additionally, the source monitoring problem contributes to the recollection and memory errors of flashbulb memories. Over time, new information is encountered and this post-significant event information from other sources may replace or added to the part of information already stored in memory. Repeated rehearsal of the news in media and between individuals make flashbulb memories more susceptible to misremembering the source of information, thus leading to less recall of true details of the event. In a study done by Dutch researchers, participants were asked about an event of El Al Boeing 747 crash on apartment buildings in Amsterdam. Ten months after the accident, participants were asked if they recalled seeing the television film of the moment the plane hit the building. According to the results, over 60% of the subjects said they had seen the crash on television, although there was no television film regarding the incident. If they said yes, there were asked questions about the details of the crash and most falsely reported that they saw the fire had started immediately. This study demonstrates that adults can falsely believe that they have witnessed something they actually have not seen themselves but only heard from news or other people. Even, they can go further to report specific but incorrect details regarding the event. The error rate in this experiment is higher than usually found in flashbulb experiments since it uses a suggestive question instead of the usual neutral ‘flashbulb memory question’ and unlike in typical flashbulb memory studies, subjects are not asked how they first learned about the event which does not lead to critical consideration of possible original source. However, it demonstrates how even flashbulb memories are susceptible to memory distortion due to source monitoring errors.

== Demographic differences ==

Although people of all ages experience flashbulb memories, different demographics and ages can influence the strength and quality of a flashbulb memory.

=== Age differences ===

In general, younger adults form flashbulb memories more readily than older adults. One study examined age-related differences in flashbulb memories: participants were tested for memory within 14 days of an important event and then retested for memory of the same event 11 months later. Even 11 months after the event occurred, nearly all the younger adults experienced flashbulb memories, but less than half of the older adults met all the criteria of a flashbulb memory. Younger and older adults also showed different reasons for recalling vivid flashbulb memories. The main predictor for creating flashbulb among younger adults was emotional connectedness to the event, whereas older adults relied more on rehearsal of the event in creating flashbulb memories. Being emotionally connected was not enough for older adults to create flashbulbs; they also needed to rehearse the event over the 11 months to remember details. Older adults also had more difficulty remembering the context of the event; the older adults were more likely to forget with whom they spoke and where events took place on a daily basis.
If older adults are significantly impacted by the dramatic event, however, they could form flashbulb memories that are just as detailed as those that younger adults form. Older adults that were personally impacted by or close to September 11 recalled memories that did not differ in detail from those of younger adults.
Older adults were found to be more confident in their memories than younger adults, in regards to whom they were with, where they were, and their own personal emotions at the time of hearing the news of 9/11. Older adults remembered a vast majority of events between the ages of 10 and 30, a period known as the &quot;reminiscence bump&quot;. During that period, events occur during a time of finding one&#x27;s identity and peak brain function. These events tend to be more talked about than events occurring outside this period. Flashbulb memories from the &quot;reminiscence bump&quot; are better remembered by older adults than are memories are having recently occurred.

=== Cultural variations ===

Generally the factors that influence flashbulb memories are considered to be constant across cultures. Tinti et al. (2009) conducted a study on memories of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s death amongst Polish, Italian, and Swiss Catholics. The results showed that personal involvement was most important in memory formation, followed by proximity to the event.

Flashbulb memories differ among cultures with the degree to which certain factors influence the vividness of flashbulb memories. For example, Asian cultures tend to de-emphasize individuality; therefore Chinese and Japanese people might not be as affected by the effects of personal involvement on vividness of flashbulb memories. A study conducted by Kulkofsky, Wang, Conway, Hou, Aydin, Johnson, and Williams (2011) investigated the formation of flashbulb memories in 5 countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Turkey. Overall participants in the United States and the United Kingdom reported more memories in a 5 minutes span than participants from Germany, Turkey, and China. This could simply be due to the fact that different cultures have different memory search strategies. In terms of flashbulb memories, Chinese participants were less affected by all factors related to personal closeness and involvement with the event. There were also cultural variations in effects of emotional intensity and surprise.

===Gender===
Some studies conducted in this area of research yielded findings indicating that women are able to produce more vivid details of events and recall autobiographical events elicited by Senate hearings than men. One such study had participants fill out questionnaires about flashbulb memories and recollections of autobiographical events pertaining to the Senate hearings that confirmed Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice (Morse, 1993). The study found that half of the individuals reported vivid memory images associated with the hearings. 64% of women reported images as opposed to 33% men. 77% of women reported having had stimulated recall of an autobiographical event, while only 27% of men indicated having experienced such recall. Women were more likely than men to report additional imagery (24% of women and 6% of men). Women were more likely than men to report vivid image memories and recall of autobiographical events elicited by the hearings, but they did not differ from men in the ratings of these memories. There was also no difference in the average amount of time spent consuming media on the hearing.

A large body of research was conducted into events taking place during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, although it was not specifically researching gender differences. In one study researchers had participants answer questions to establish &quot;consistent flashbulb memory,&quot; which consists of details about where the participants were at the time of the attacks, what they were doing, etc. In 2002 it was found that 49% of women and 47% of men fulfilled these requirements. In 2003, this dropped to 46% of women and 44% of men (Conway, 2009). Women seemed more likely to have a more consistent memory for the event than men in this study. A longer time since the incident decreases the consistency of the memory. However, a study aimed at finding whether a series of terrorist attacks with common features elicit flashbulb memories found a different pattern of gender effects. Men rated the distinctiveness of their flashbulb-producing event higher than women did. Additionally, men had memories with more detail than women. Women however, reported higher rates of emotional reactivity.

Biological reasons for gender variances in flashbulb memory may be explained by amygdala asymmetry. The amygdala is a part of the limbic system, and is linked with memory and emotion. Memory is enhanced by emotion, and studies have shown that people are more likely to remember a negative event than a neutral or positive one. Investigations into the amygdala revealed &quot;people who showed strong amygdala activation in response to a set of positive or negative stimuli (relative to other study participants) also showed superior memory for those stimuli (relative to other study participants)&quot;. This may explain why flashbulb memory typically involves traumatic events. When viewing emotional content, research has shown that men enhance their memory by activating their right amygdala while women activate the left side. Although it is still unclear how lateralization affects memory, there may be a more effective relationship between activation of the left amygdala and memory than activation of right and memory. Generally speaking, studies testing differences between genders on episodic memory tasks revealed that &quot;women consistently outperform men on tasks that require remembering items that are verbal in nature or can be verbally labeled&quot; (Herlitz, 2008). It seems that women also &quot;excel on tasks requiring little or no verbal processing, such as recognition of unfamiliar odors or faces&quot; (Herlitz, 2008). Men only seem to excel in memory tasks that require visuospatial processing. Gender differences are also very apparent in research on autobiographical memory. To sum up these gender differences, most literature on memory indicates that:

Overall women seem to have better memory performance than men in both emotional and non-emotional events.

There are many problems with assessing gender differences found in the research into this topic. The clearest is that it is heavily reliant on self-reporting of events. Inaccuracy of findings could result from biased questions or participants misremembering. There is no way to completely verify the accuracy of accounts given by the subjects in a study. Additionally, there are many indications that eye-witness memory can often be fallible. Emotion does not seem to improve memory performance in a situation that involves weapons. Eyewitnesses remember fewer details about perpetrators if a weapon is involved in an event (Pickel, 2009). Accuracy in these situations is compromised by a phenomenon known as the weapon focus effect. Further complicating matters is the time frame in which people are surveyed in relation to the event as many studies survey people well after the events. Thus, there is a validity issue with much of the research into flashbulb memory in general, as well as any apparent gender differences.

== Improvement ==

A number of studies have found that flashbulb memories are formed immediately after a life changing event happens or when news of the event is relayed. Although additional information about the event can then be researched or learned, the extra information is often lost in memory due to different encoding processes. A more recent study, examining effects of the media on flashbulb memories for the September 11, 2001 attacks, shows that extra information may help retain vivid flashbulb memories. Although the researchers found that memory for the event decreased over time for all participants, looking at images had a profound effect on participants memory. Those who said they saw images of the September 11th attacks immediately retained much more vivid images 6-months later than those who said they saw images hours after they heard about the attacks. The latter participants failed to encode the images with the original learning of the event. Thus, it may be the images themselves that lead some of the participants to recall more details of the event. Graphic images may make an individual associate more with the horror and scale of a tragic event and hence produce a more elaborate encoding mechanism. Furthermore, perhaps looking at images may help individuals retain vivid flashbulb memories months, and perhaps even years, after an event occurs.

== Controversy: special mechanism hypothesis ==

The special-mechanism hypothesis has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent years, with some authors endorsing the hypothesis and others noting potential problems.This hypothesis divides memory processes into different categories, positing that different mechanisms underlie flashbulb memories. Yet many argue that flashbulb memories are simply the product of multiple, unique factors coalescing.

===Supporting evidence===

Data concerning people&#x27;s recollections of the Reagan assassination attempt provide support for the special-mechanism hypothesis. People had highly accurate accounts of the event and had lost very few details regarding the event several months after it occurred. Additionally, an experiment examining emotional state and word valence found that people are better able to remember irrelevant information when they are in a negative, shocked state. There is also neurological evidence in support of a special mechanism view. Emotionally neutral autobiographical events, such as a party, were compared with two emotionally arousing events: Princess Diana&#x27;s death, and Mother Teresa&#x27;s death. Long-term memory for the contextual details of an emotionally neutral autobiographical event was related to medial temporal lobe function and correlated with frontal lobe function, whereas there was no hint of an effect of either medial temporal lobe or frontal lobe function on memory for the two flashbulb events. These results indicate that there might be a special neurobiological mechanism associated with emotionally arousing flashbulb memories.

===Opposing evidence===

Studies have shown that flashbulb memories can result from non-surprising events, such as the first Moon landing, and also from non-consequential events. While Brown and Kulik defined flashbulb memories as memories of first learning about a shocking event, they expand their discussion to include personal events in which the memory is of the event itself. Simply asking participants to retrieve vivid, autobiographical memories has been shown to produce memories that contain the six features of flashbulb memories. Therefore, it has been proposed that such memories be viewed as products of ordinary memory mechanisms. Moreover, flashbulb memories have been shown to be susceptible to errors in reconstructive processes, specifically systematic bias. It has been suggested that flashbulb memories are not especially resistant to forgetting. A number of studies suggest that flashbulb memories are not especially accurate, but that they are experienced with great vividness and confidence. Therefore, it is argued that it may be more precise to define flashbulb memories as extremely vivid autobiographical memories. Although they are often memories of learning about a shocking public event, they are not limited to such events, and not all memories of learning about shocking public events produce flashbulb memories.

==Models==
===Photographic model===
Brown and Kulik proposed the term &quot;flashbulb memory&quot;, along with the first model of the process involved in developing what they called &quot;flashbulb accounts&quot;. The photographic model proposes that in order for a flashbulb account to occur in the presence of a stimulus event, there must be, a high level of surprise, consequentiality, and emotional arousal. Specifically, at the time in which an individual first hears of an event, the degree of unexpectedness and surprise is the first step in the registration of the event. The next step involved in registration of flashbulb accounts is the degree of consequentiality, which in turn, triggers a certain level of emotional arousal. Brown and Kulik described consequentiality as the things one would imagine may have gone differently if the event had not occurred, or what consequences the event had on an individual&#x27;s life. Further, Brown and Kulik believed that high levels of these variables would also result in frequent rehearsal, being either covert (&quot;always on the mind&quot;) or overt (ex. talked about in conversations with others). Rehearsal, which acts as a mediating process in the development of a flashbulb account, creates stronger associations and more elaborate accounts. Therefore, the flashbulb memory becomes more accessible and vividly remembered for a long period of time.

===Comprehensive model===
Some researchers recognized that previous studies of flashbulb memories are limited by the reliance on small sample groups of few nationalities, thus limiting the comparison of memory consistency across different variables. The comprehensive model was born out of similar experimentation as Brown and Kulik&#x27;s, but with a larger participant sample. One major difference between the two models is that the Photographic Model follows more of a step-by-step process in the development of flashbulb accounts, whereas the Comprehensive Model demonstrates an interconnected relationship between the variables. Specifically, knowledge and interest in the event affects the level of personal importance for the individual, which also affects the individual&#x27;s level of emotional arousal (affect). Furthermore, knowledge and interest pertaining to the event, as well as the level of importance, contribute to the frequency of rehearsal. Therefore, high levels of knowledge and interest contribute to high levels of personal importance and affect, as well as high frequency of rehearsal. Finally, affect and rehearsal play major roles in creating associations, thus enabling the individual to remember vivid attributes of the event, such as the people, place, and description of the situation.

===Emotional-integrative model===
The Emotional-Integrative Model of flashbulb memories integrates the two previously discussed models the Photographic Model and the Comprehensive Model. Similar to the Photographic Model, the Emotional-Integrative Model states that the first step toward the registration of a flashbulb memory is an individual&#x27;s degree of surprise associated with the event. This level of surprise triggers an emotional feeling state, which is also a result of the combination of the level of importance (consequentiality) of the event to the individual, and the individual&#x27;s affective attitude. The emotional feeling state of the individual directly contributes to the creation of a flashbulb memory. To strengthen the association, thus enabling the individual to vividly remember the event, emotional feeling state and affective attitude contribute to overt rehearsal (mediator) of the event to strengthen the memory of the original event which, in turn, determines the formation of a flashbulb memory. According to the Emotional-Integrative model flashbulb memories can also be formed for expected events. The formation of flashbulb memories in this case depends greatly on a high emotional relationship to the event and rehearsal of the memory.

=== Importance-driven emotional reactions model===
This model emphasizes that personal consequences determine intensity of emotional reactions. These consequences are, therefore, critical operators in the formation and maintenance of flashbulb memories. This model was based on whether traumatic events were experienced or not during the Marmara earthquake. According to the findings of this study, the memories of the people who experienced the earthquake were preserved as a whole, and unchanged over time. Results of the re-test showed that the long-term memories of the victim group are more complete, more durable and more consistent than those of the comparison group. Therefore, based on this study, a new model was formed that highlights that consequences play a very large role in the formation of flashbulb memories.

===Compared to traumatic memories===
Flashbulb memories are engendered by highly emotional, surprising events. Flashbulb memories differ from traumatic events because they do not generally contain an emotional response. Traumatic memories involve some element of fear or anxiety. While flashbulb memories can include components of negative emotion, these elements are generally absent.

There are some similarities between traumatic and flashbulb memories. During a traumatic event, high arousal can increase attention to central information leading to increased vividness and detail. Another similar characteristic is that memory for traumatic events is enhanced by emotional stimuli. An additional, a difference between the nature of flashbulb memories and traumatic memories is the amount of information regarding unimportant details that will be encoded in the memory of the event. In high-stress situations, arousal dampens memory for peripheral information—such as context, location, time, or other less important details. To rephrase, flashbulb memories are described as acute awareness of where a person was and what they were doing when a significant or traumatic event occurred, and are not characterized by strong emotion, while traumatic memories are accompanied by highly negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, and panic when the related event is recalled.

== Neurological bases ==

=== Amygdala ===

Laboratory studies have related specific neural systems to the influence of emotion on memory. Cross-species investigations have shown that emotional arousal causes neurohormonal changes, which engage the amygdala. The amygdala modulates the encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memory. These memories are later retrieved with an enhanced recollective experience, similar to the recollection of flashbulb memories. The amygdala, therefore, may be important in the encoding and retrieval of memories for emotional public events. Since the role of the amygdala in memory is associated with increased arousal induced by the emotional event, factors that influence arousal should also influence the nature of these memories. The constancy of flashbulb memories over time varies based on the individual factors related to the arousal response, such as emotional engagement and personal involvement with the shocking event. The strength of amygdala activation at retrieval has been shown to correlate with an enhanced recollective experience for emotional scenes, even when accuracy is not enhanced. Memory storage is increased by endocrine responses to shocking events; the more shocking an individual finds an event, the more likely a vivd flashbulb memory will develop.

There has been considerable debate as to whether unique mechanisms are involved in the formation of flashbulb memories, or whether ordinary memory processes are sufficient to account for memories of shocking public events. Sharot et al. found that for individuals who were close to the World Trade Center, the retrieval of 9/11 memories engaged neural systems that are uniquely tied to the influence of emotion on memory. The engagement of these emotional memory circuits is consistent with the unique limbic mechanism that Brown and Kulik suggested. These are the same neural mechanisms, however, engaged during the retrieval of emotional stimuli in the laboratory. The consistency in the pattern of neural responses during the retrieval of emotional scenes presented in the laboratory and flashbulb memories suggests that even though different mechanisms may be involved in flashbulb memories, these mechanisms are not unique to the surprising and consequential nature of the initiating events.

Evidence indicates the importance of the amygdala in the retrieval of 9/11 events, but only among individuals who personally experienced these events. The amygdala&#x27;s influence on episodic memory is explicitly tied to physiological arousal. Although simply hearing about shocking public events may result in arousal, the strength of this response likely varies depending on the individual&#x27;s personal experience with the events.

==Critique of research==

Flashbulb memory research tends to focus on public events that have a negative valence. There is a shortage on studies regarding personal events such as accidents or trauma. This is due to the nature of the variables needed for flashbulb memory research: the experience of a surprising event is hard to manipulate. Also, it is very hard to conduct experiments on flashbulb memories due to lack of control over the events. In an empirical study, it is very difficult to control the rehearsal amount.

Some researchers also argue that the effect of rehearsal factors on individual memory is different with respect to the availability of the mass media across different societies.

<text>The Germany national football team () represents Germany in men&#x27;s international football and played its first match in 1908. The team is governed by the German Football Association (&quot;Deutscher Fußball-Bund&quot;), founded in 1900. Between 1949 and 1990, separate German national teams were recognised by FIFA due to Allied occupation and division: the DFB&#x27;s team representing the Federal Republic of Germany (commonly referred to as West Germany in English between 1949 and 1990), the Saarland team representing the Saar Protectorate (1950–1956) and the East Germany team representing the German Democratic Republic (1952–1990). The latter two were absorbed along with their records; the present team represents the reunified Federal Republic. The official name and code &quot;Germany FR (FRG)&quot; was shortened to &quot;Germany (GER)&quot; following reunification in 1990.

Germany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions, having won four FIFA World Cups (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014), tied with Italy, and only one less than the most successful team, Brazil. Having won three European Championships (1972, 1980, 1996) Germany is second behind Spain, the record holder in that international competition with four. Germany won also a Confederations Cup in 2017. They have also been runners-up at the European Championship three times, and four times at the World Cup, with a further four third-place finishes at the World Cup. East Germany won Olympic Gold in 1976. Germany was the first, and is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup (the other being Spain). By combined World Cups, Germany stands as the most successful football nation in history with six World Cups – four for the men&#x27;s team and two for the women&#x27;s. At the end of the 2014 World Cup, Germany earned the second highest Elo rating of any national football team in history, with 2,223 points. Germany is also the only European nation that has won a FIFA World Cup in the Americas.

== History ==
=== Early years (1899–1942) ===

On 18 April 1897, an early international game on German soil was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association, 5–0.

Between 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five international matches between Germany and English selection teams, which are today not recognised as official by either nation&#x27;s football association (in part because England fielded their amateur side, which was an overflow or B team). All five matches ended in large defeats for the Germany teams, including a 12–0 loss at White Hart Lane in September 1901. Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association (DFB) in 1900, the first official match of the Germany national football team was played on 5 April 1908, against Switzerland in Basel, with the Swiss winning 5–3. A follow-up to the earlier series between England Amateurs and Germany occurred in March 1909 at Oxford&#x27;s White House Ground and resulted in Germany&#x27;s largest official defeat to date: 9–0 (this time, the match was recognised and recorded as official by the DFB but not by the FA, again due to the amateur side being fielded). These early confrontations formed the beginning of the rich rivalry between the two teams: one of the longest and most enduring international rivalries in football.

Julius Hirsch was the first Jewish player to represent the Germany national football team, which he joined in 1911. Hirsch scored four goals for Germany against the Netherlands in 1912, becoming the first German to score four goals in a single match.
Gottfried Fuchs scored a world record 10 goals for Germany in a 16–0 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm on 1 July, becoming the top scorer of the tournament; his international record was not surpassed until 2001 when Australia&#x27;s Archie Thompson scored 13 goals in a 31–0 defeat of American Samoa. He was Jewish, and the German Football Association erased all references to him from their records between 1933 and 1945. As of 2016, he was still the top German scorer for one match.

At that time the players were selected by the DFB, as there was no dedicated coach. The first manager of the Germany national team was Otto Nerz, a school teacher from Mannheim, who served in the role from 1926 to 1936. The German FA could not afford travel to Uruguay for the first World Cup staged in 1930 during the Great Depression, but finished third in the 1934 World Cup in their first appearance in the competition. After a poor showing at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Sepp Herberger became coach. In 1937 he put together a squad which was soon nicknamed the &quot;Breslau Elf&quot; (the Breslau Eleven) in recognition of their 8–0 win over Denmark in the then German city of Breslau, Lower Silesia (now Wrocław, Poland).

After Austria became part of Germany in the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of March 1938, the Austrian national team – one of Europe&#x27;s best sides at the time due to professionalism – was disbanded despite having already qualified for the 1938 World Cup. Nazi politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs Rapid Vienna, Austria Vienna, and First Vienna FC, to join the &quot;all-German&quot; team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons. At the 1938 World Cup in France, this &quot;united&quot; Germany national team managed only a 1–1 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2–4 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris. That early exit stands as Germany&#x27;s worst World Cup result, and one of just three occasions the team failed to progress from the group stage – the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament, and it would be repeated in 2022.

During World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942. National team games were then suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as &quot;Rote Jäger&quot; through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.

=== Three German national teams (1945–1990) ===
After World War II, Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950. The DFB was not a full member of FIFA, and none of the three new German states – West Germany, East Germany, and Saarland – entered the 1950 World Cup qualifiers.

The Federal Republic of Germany, which was referred to as West Germany, continued the DFB. With recognition by FIFA and UEFA, the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team. Switzerland was the first team that played West Germany in 1950, with the latter qualifying for the 1954 World Cup and the former hosting it.

The Saarland, a French protectorate between 1947 and 1956, did not join French organisations, and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. It sent their own team to the 1952 Summer Olympics and to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers. In 1957, Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.

In 1949, the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded. In 1952 the &quot;Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR&quot; (DFV) was established and the East Germany national football team took to the field. They were the only team to beat the 1974 FIFA World Cup winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation. East Germany won the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics. After German reunification in 1990, the eastern football competition was reintegrated into the DFB.

=== 1954 World Cup victory ===
West Germany, captained by Fritz Walter, met in the 1954 World Cup against Turkey, Yugoslavia and Austria. When playing favourites Hungary in the group stage, West Germany lost 3–8, and faced the Hungarian &quot;Mighty Magyars&quot; again in the final. Hungary had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches, and West Germany snapped the streak by winning 3–2, with Helmut Rahn scoring the winning goal. The success is called &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot; (&quot;Das Wunder von Bern&quot;).

=== Memorable losses: Wembley goal and game of the century (1958–1970) ===
After finishing fourth in the 1958 World Cup and reaching only the quarter-finals in the 1962 World Cup, the DFB made changes. Professionalism was introduced, and the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new Bundesliga. In 1964, Helmut Schön took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.

In the 1966 World Cup, West Germany reached the final after beating the USSR in the semi-final, facing hosts England. In extra time, the first goal by Geoff Hurst was one of the most contentious goals in the history of the World Cup: the linesman signalled the ball had crossed the line for a goal, after bouncing down from the crossbar, when replays showed it did not appear to have fully crossed the line. Hurst then scored another goal giving England a 4–2 win.

West Germany in the 1970 World Cup knocked England out in the quarter-finals 3–2, before they suffered a 4–3 extra-time loss in the semi-final against Italy. This match with five goals in extra time is one of the most dramatic in World Cup history, and is called the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; in both Italy and Germany. West Germany claimed third by beating Uruguay 1–0. Gerd Müller finished as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer with 10 goals.

=== 1974 World Cup title on home soil ===
In 1971, Franz Beckenbauer became captain of the national team, and he led West Germany to victory at the European Championship at Euro 1972, defeating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final.

As hosts of the 1974 World Cup, they won their second World Cup, defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final in Munich.
Two matches in the 1974 World Cup stood out for West Germany. The first group stage saw a politically charged match as West Germany played a game against East Germany. The East Germans won 1–0 but it made a scant difference to West Germany as the West Germans advanced to the knockout stage. The West Germans advanced to the final against the Johan Cruyff-led Dutch team and their brand of &quot;Total Football&quot;. The Dutch took the lead from a penalty. However, West Germany tied the match on a penalty by Paul Breitner, and won it with Gerd Müller&#x27;s fine finish soon after.

=== Late 1970s and early 1980s ===

West Germany failed to defend their titles in the next two major international tournaments. They lost to Czechoslovakia in the UEFA Euro 1976 final in a penalty shootout 5–3, their last penalty shootout loss in a major tournament as of 2022.

In the 1978 World Cup, Germany was eliminated in the second group stage after losing 3–2 to Austria. Schön retired as coach afterward, and the post was taken over by his assistant, Jupp Derwall.

West Germany&#x27;s first tournament under Derwall was successful, as they earned their second European title at Euro 1980 after defeating Belgium 2–1 in the final. West Germany started the 1982 World Cup with a 1–2 upset by newcomers Algeria in their first match, but advanced to the second round with a controversial 1–0 win over Austria. In the semi-final against France, they tied the match 3–3 and won the penalty shootout 5–4. In the final, they were defeated by Italy 1–3.

During this period, West Germany&#x27;s Gerd Müller racked up fourteen goals in two World Cups (1970 and 1974). His ten goals in 1970 are the third-most ever in a tournament. Müller&#x27;s all-time World Cup record of 14 goals was broken by Ronaldo in 2006; this was then further broken by Miroslav Klose in 2014 with 16 goals.

=== Beckenbauer&#x27;s managing success (1984–1990) ===

After West Germany were eliminated in the first round of Euro 1984, Franz Beckenbauer returned to the national team to replace Derwall as manager. At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament after beating France 2–0 in the semi-finals, but losing to the Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the final, 2–3. In Euro 1988, after drawing Italy 1–1 and beating both Denmark and Spain 2–0 in the group stage, West Germany&#x27;s hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the Netherlands, as the Dutch beat them 2–1 in the semi-finals.

At the 1990 World Cup in Italy, West Germany won their third World Cup title, in its unprecedented third consecutive final appearance. Captained by Lothar Matthäus, they defeated Yugoslavia (4–1), UAE (5–1), the Netherlands (2–1), Czechoslovakia (1–0), and England (1–1, 4–3 on penalty kicks) on the way to a final rematch against Argentina in Rome. West Germany won 1–0, with the only goal being a penalty scored in the 85th minute by Andreas Brehme. Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as the national team&#x27;s captain in 1974, thus became the first person to win the World Cup as both captain and manager, and the second to win as player and manager, after Mario Zagallo of Brazil.

=== Olympic football ===
East Germany did however achieve significantly greater success in Olympic football than the amateur teams fielded by the Western NOC of Germany due to using its elite players from the top domestic league. In 1956, 1960, and 1964 both states had sent a United Team of Germany. For 1964, the East German side had beaten their Western counterparts in order to be selected. They went on to win the bronze medal for Germany. As GDR, they won bronze in 1972 in Munich, gold in 1976 in Montreal, and silver in 1980 in Moscow.

Prior to 1984, Olympic football was an amateur event, meaning that only non-professional players could participate. Due to this, West Germany was never able to achieve the same degree of success at the Olympics as at the World Cup. The first medal coming in the 1988 Olympics, when they won the bronze medal after beating Italy 3–0 in the 3rd place match. West Germany also reached the second round in both 1972 and 1984. On the other hand, due to having an ability to field its top-level players who were classified as amateurs on a technicality East Germany did better, winning a gold, a silver and two bronze medals (one representing the United Team of Germany).

=== Berti Vogts years (1990–1998) ===

In February 1990, three months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany and West Germany were drawn together in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5. In November 1990, the East German association Deutscher Fußball-Verband integrated into the DFB, by which time the East Germany team had ceased operations, playing its last match on 12 September 1990. The unified Germany national team completed the European Championship qualifying group. The East German 1990–91 league continued, with a restructuring of German leagues in 1991–92. The first game with a unified Germany national team was against Switzerland on 19 December.

After the 1990 World Cup, assistant Berti Vogts took over as the national team coach from the retiring Beckenbauer. In Euro 1992, Germany reached the final, but lost 0–2 to underdogs Denmark. In the 1994 World Cup, they were upset 1–2 in the quarterfinals by Bulgaria.

Reunified Germany won its first major international title at Euro 1996, becoming European champions for the third time. They defeated hosts England in the semi-finals, and the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final on a golden goal in extra time.

However, in the 1998 World Cup, Germany were eliminated in the quarterfinals in a 0–3 defeat to Croatia, all goals being scored after defender Christian Wörns received a straight red card. Vogts stepped down afterwards and was replaced by Erich Ribbeck.

=== Erich Ribbeck and Rudi Völler years (2000–2004) ===
In Euro 2000, the team went out in the first round, drawing with Romania, then suffering a 1–0 defeat to England and were routed 3–0 by Portugal (which fielded their backup players, having already advanced). Ribbeck resigned, and was replaced by Rudi Völler.

Coming into the 2002 World Cup, expectations of Germany were low due to poor results in the qualifiers, and not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time. The team advanced through group play, and in the knockout stages they produced three consecutive 1–0 wins against Paraguay, the United States, and co-hosts South Korea. Oliver Neuville scored two minutes from time against Paraguay and Michael Ballack scored both goals in the US and South Korea games, although he picked up a second yellow card against South Korea for a tactical foul and was suspended for the subsequent match. This set up a final against Brazil, the first World Cup meeting between the two. Germany lost 0–2 thanks to two Ronaldo goals. Nevertheless, German captain and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn won the Golden Ball, the first time in the World Cup that a goalkeeper was named the best player of the tournament.
Germany once again exited in the first round at Euro 2004, drawing their first two matches and losing the third to the Czech Republic (who had fielded a second-string team). Völler resigned afterwards, and Jürgen Klinsmann was appointed head coach.

=== Resurgence under Klinsmann (2004–2006) ===

Klinsmann&#x27;s main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He relieved goalkeeper Kahn of the captaincy and announced that Kahn and longtime backup Jens Lehmann would be competing for the position of starting goaltender, a decision that angered Kahn and Lehmann eventually won that contest. Expectations for the team were low, which was not helped by veteran defender Christian Wörns being dropped (after Wörns criticised Klinsmann for designating him only as a backup player on the squad), a choice roundly panned in Germany. Italy routed Germany 4–1 in a March 2006 exhibition game, and Klinsmann bore the brunt of the criticism as the team was ranked only 22nd in the world entering the 2006 World Cup.

As World Cup hosts, Germany won all three group stage matches to finish top of their group. The team defeated Sweden 2–0 in the round of 16,
and Argentina in the quarter-finals in a penalty shootout. The semi-final against Italy was scoreless until near the end of extra time when Germany conceded two goals.
In the third place match, Germany defeated Portugal 3–1.
Miroslav Klose was awarded the Golden Boot for his tournament-leading five goals.

=== Löw era (2006–2021) ===
==== Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 ====

Germany&#x27;s entry into the Euro 2008 qualifying round was marked by the promotion of Joachim Löw following the resignation of Klinsmann.
At UEFA Euro 2008, Germany won two out of three matches in group play to advance to the knockout round.
They defeated Portugal 3–2 in the quarter-final,
and won their semi-final against Turkey.
Germany lost the final against Spain 1–0, finishing as the runners-up.

At the 2010 World Cup, Germany won the group and advanced to the knockout stage. In the round of 16, Germany defeated England 4–1. In the quarter-finals, Germany defeated Argentina 4–0, and Miroslav Klose tied German Gerd Müller&#x27;s record of 14 World Cup goals. In the semi-final, Germany lost 1–0 to Spain. Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to take third place (their second third place after 2006). German Thomas Müller won the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player Award.

At Euro 2012, Germany was placed in group B along with Portugal, Netherlands, and Denmark. Germany won all three group matches. Germany defeated Greece in the quarter-final and set a record of 15 consecutive wins in all competitive matches. In the semi-finals, Germany lost to Italy, 2–1.

==== 2014 World Cup victory ====
Germany were placed in Group G of the 2014 World Cup, with Portugal, Ghana, and the United States. They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the &quot;team of all the talents against the team of The Talent (Cristiano Ronaldo)&quot;, routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller. In their match with Ghana, they led the game before Ghana fought back to lead the match. Klose scored a goal to level Germany 2–2, his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers. They then went on to defeat the Klinsmann-led United States 1–0, securing them a spot in the knockout stages.

The round of sixteen knockout match against Algeria remained goalless after regulation time, resulting in extra time. In the 92nd minute, André Schürrle scored a goal from a Thomas Müller pass. Mesut Özil scored Germany&#x27;s second goal in the 120th minute with the match ending 2–1. In the quarter-final match against France, Mats Hummels scored in the 13th minute. Germany won the game 1–0 to advance to a record fourth consecutive semi-finals.

The 7–1 semi-final win against Brazil was one of the most memorable games in World Cup history; Germany scored four goals in just less than seven minutes and were 5–0 up by the 30th minute with goals from Thomas Müller, Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos. Germany&#x27;s 7–0 in the second half was the highest score against Brazil in a single game. It was Brazil&#x27;s worst ever World Cup defeat, whilst Germany broke multiple World Cup records with the win, including the record broken by Klose, the first team to reach four consecutive World Cup semi-finals, the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup Finals knockout phase game, the fastest five consecutive goals in World Cup history (four of which in just 400 seconds), and the first team to score five goals in the first half in a World Cup semi-final.

The World Cup final was held at the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro on 13 July. Mario Götze&#x27;s 113th-minute goal helped Germany beat Argentina 1–0, becoming the first-ever European team to win a FIFA World Cup in the Americas and the second European team to win the title outside Europe.

==== Euro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup ====

After several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win, including Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose, the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers. They defeated Scotland 2–1 at home, then suffered a 2–0 loss at Poland (the first in their history), a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland, and a 4–0 win over Gibraltar. Troubles during qualifying for the 2016 European Championship continued, drawing at home, as well as losing away, to Ireland; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions, but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar (who competed for the first time). They would eventually win their group and qualify for the tournament.

On 13 November 2015, Germany played a friendly against France in Paris when a series of terrorist attacks took place in the city, some in the direct vicinity of the Stade de France, where the game was held. For security reasons, the team spent the night inside the stadium, accompanied by the French squad who stayed behind in an act of comradery. Four days later, Germany was scheduled to face the Netherlands at Hanover&#x27;s HDI-Arena, in another friendly. After initial security reservations, the DFB decided to play the match on 15 November. After reports about a concrete threat to the stadium, the match was cancelled 90 minutes before kickoff.

At UEFA Euro 2016, Germany began their campaign with a 2–0 win against Ukraine. Against Poland, Germany were held to a 0–0 draw but concluded Group C play with a 1–0 win against Northern Ireland. In the round of 16, Germany faced Slovakia and earned a comfortable 3–0 win. Germany then faced off against rivals Italy in the quarter-finals. Mesut Özil opened the scoring in the 65th minute for Germany, before Leonardo Bonucci drew even after converting a penalty in the 78th minute. The score remained 1–1 after extra time, and Germany beat Italy 6–5 in a penalty shootout. It was the first time Germany had overcome Italy in a major tournament. The Germans lost to hosts France 2–0 in the semi-finals, their first competitive win against Germany in 58 years.

Germany qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup after winning the 2014 World Cup, and won the last version of the Confederations Cup after a 1–0 win against Chile in the final at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

==== Disappointment at the 2018 World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020 ====
After winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year, Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat to Mexico, their first loss in an opening match since the 1982 World Cup. Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury-time winner from Toni Kroos, but were subsequently eliminated following a 2–0 loss to South Korea, their first exit in the first round since 1938 and first in the group stage since the format had been reintroduced in 1950. With this result Germany became the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stages of the World Cup, following Brazil in 1966, France in 2002, Italy in 2010, and Spain in 2014.

Following the World Cup, Germany&#x27;s struggles continued into the inaugural UEFA Nations League. After a 0–0 draw at home against France, they lost 3–0 against the Netherlands and 2–1 in the rematch against France three days later; the latter result being their fourth loss in six competitive matches. Due to results elsewhere, the relegation to League B was originally confirmed, but due to the overhaul of the format for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, Germany were spared from relegation to League B.

In March 2021, the DFB announced that Löw would step down as Germany&#x27;s manager after UEFA Euro 2020. Later that month, Germany lost 2–1 at home to North Macedonia in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, their first World Cup qualification defeat since losing 5–1 to England in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and only their third in history. On 25 May 2021, the DFB announced that former assistant manager Hansi Flick would replace Löw as head coach.

At Euro 2020 (delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Germany were drawn with World Cup champions France (to whom they lost 1–0) and reigning European champions Portugal (whom they defeated 4–2), with each group having only two guaranteed qualifiers for the next phase, plus a chance for the third-placed team. In the final group match, the Hungarians took the lead twice only to draw. Germany then lost 2–0 to England in the round of 16, their first round of 16 exit in a major tournament since the 1938 World Cup.

=== Recent years (2021–present) ===

Following Germany&#x27;s disappointment at Euro 2020, Hansi Flick, former Bayern Munich manager, took over as coach of the national team. On 11 October 2021, Germany beat North Macedonia 4–0 to become the first team (outside of the hosts) to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. In the 2022–23 Nations League, Germany recorded their first-ever competitive win against Italy as the Germans beat the visitors 5–2. This was Germany&#x27;s fourth game and first win in the league, however the Germans finished third in the group.
At the 2022 World Cup, Germany were drawn into Group E with Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. The campaign started with a shock 2–1 defeat to Japan. Germany drew 1–1 with Spain, and then were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stage for the second consecutive tournament, despite a 4–2 win over Costa Rica, missing out on a place in the knockout stages on goal difference.

After several poor performances following Germany&#x27;s World Cup exit – including a 4–1 home loss to Japan – Flick was dismissed on 10 September 2023.

On 22 September 2023, Julian Nagelsmann was named the new head coach. After a rocky end to 2023, only winning one out of four games, Germany found itself back in form in the new year with a second victory against France and the Netherlands, strengthening hopes for a successful UEFA Euro 2024 campaign.

As hosts of Euro 2024, Germany won the tournament&#x27;s opening match against Scotland with a score of 5–1. Germany went on to defeat Hungary 2–0 in their second match to qualify for the round of 16.

=== Kits and crest ===

The national team&#x27;s home kit has been traditionally a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia. Since 1988, many of the home kit&#x27;s designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, Germany&#x27;s kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA&#x27;s kit clashing rule for the tournament. The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours – though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II. However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland. Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.

A change from black to red came in 2005 on the request of Jürgen Klinsmann, but Germany played every game at the 2006 World Cup in its home white colours. In 2010, the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts, but at the World Cup, the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit. The kit used by Germany returned to a green shirt on its away kit, but then changed again to red-and-black striped shirts with white stripes and letters and black shorts.

Adidas AG is the longstanding kit provider to the national team, a sponsorship that began in 1954 and is contracted to continue until at least 2022. In the 70s, Germany wore Erima kits (a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas). In March 2024, Nike was announced as the new kit sponsor after 70 years of Adidas, causing widespread criticism and backlash.

As a common practice, three stars were added above the crest in 1996, symbolising Germany&#x27;s World Cup titles in 1954, 1974 and 1990. In 2014, a fourth star was added after Germany were crowned world champions for the fourth time.

Germany has won the FIFA World Cup four times, behind only Brazil&#x27;s five. It has finished as runners-up four times. In terms of semi-final appearances, Germany leads with 13, two more than Brazil&#x27;s 11, who have participated in every single tournament. From 1954 to 2014 (16 tournaments), Germany reached at least the stage of the last eight teams, before being eliminated in the group stage in 2018. Germany has also qualified for every one of the 19 World Cups for which it has entered – it did not enter the inaugural competition in Uruguay in 1930 for economic reasons, and were banned from the 1950 World Cup as the DFB was reinstated as a FIFA member only two months after this tournament.

Germany has also won the European Championship three times, the joint-most with Spain. France and Italy, with two titles each, are the only other multiple winners. Germany finished as runners-up three times. The Germans have qualified for every European Championship tournament except for the first European Championship they entered in 1968. For that tournament, Germany was in the only group of three teams and thus only played four qualifying games. The deciding game was a scoreless draw in Albania which gave Yugoslavia the edge, having won in their neighbour country. The team finished outside the top eight in only three occasions: group stage eliminations in 2000 and 2004 alongside a round of 16 exit in 2020. In the other editions Germany participated in they reached at least the semi-finals nine times, an unparalleled record in Europe.

<text>USS &quot;Boone&quot; (FFG-28) was the twentieth ship in the United States Navy&#x27;s of guided missile frigates.

The frigate was named for Vice Admiral Joel Thompson Boone, M.D. (1889–1974). FFG-28, the first U.S. ship to bear the admiral&#x27;s name, was ordered 23 January 1978, launched 16 January 1980 by Todd Pacific Shipyards, and commissioned 15 May 1982. She has since earned numerous awards and commendations.

==History==
On 30 November 2006, the rudder fell off Mayport-based frigate &quot;Boone&quot; while on deployment in the western Mediterranean. The mishap forced the ship to send out a call for help to which Canadian destroyer responded, providing divers who inspected the ship&#x27;s underside. Within 24 hours, &quot;Boone&quot; was being towed to Rota for repairs by the German Navy&#x27;s replenishment oiler &quot;Spessart&quot;. The ship was not adrift or totally dead in the water because its two 350-horsepower auxiliary propulsion units provided a &quot;limited amount of maneuverability.&quot; The lost rudder was replaced 27 December and, after a day of operational testing, &quot;Boone&quot; got underway again on 28 December.

&quot;Boone&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 14 and was the recipient of the 2005 DESRON 14 Battle &quot;E&quot;. On 16 February 2007, she was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

&quot;Boone&quot; was homeported in Mayport, Florida, and was a member of the Navy Reserve. In March 2010, she was assigned to the United States Fifth Fleet fighting Somali piracy.

&quot;Boone&quot; was decommissioned on 23 February 2012.

===Sinking===
On 18 August 2022, &quot;Boone&quot; was towed to Campbeltown, Scotland to be sunk as part of a SINKEX involving Harpoon missiles fired by the Royal Navy Type 23 frigate , to test a new US targeting satellite. The SINKEX took place on 7 September 2022 with the participation of both US and UK forces. From the sea, she was struck by two Harpoon anti-ship missiles fired by HMS &quot;Westminster&quot; and an SM-6 from . Meanwhile, from the air, she was struck by two Paveway IV laser-guided bombs from Royal Air Force Typhoon fighters, two JDAMs from US Air Force F-15 Eagles, a Martlet missile from &quot;Westminster&#x27;s&quot; Wildcat helicopter and a Harpoon anti-ship missile from a US Navy P-8 Poseidon.

<text>The International Exhibition of 1862, officially the London International Exhibition of Industry and Art, also known as the Great London Exposition, was a world&#x27;s fair held from 1 May to 1 November 1862 in South Kensington, London, England. The site now houses museums including the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum.

==Background and overview==
After the Great Exhibition, held in 1851, had proven to be a huge success, the British Government planned another international exhibition that would surpass both this one and the 1855 Paris Exposition, larger in both size and scale. The intention was to showcase the advances which had since been made in industry, technology, and arts. It was intended to be held in 1861, but was delayed owing to various international events, including the Italian War of Independence and American Civil War (which caused a shortage of cotton, among other things).

The exposition, officially named the London International Exhibition of Industry and Art, was sponsored by the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Trade, and featured over 28,000 exhibitors from 36 countries, representing a wide range of industry, technology, and the arts. William Sterndale Bennett composed music for the opening ceremony.

The opening took place on 1 May 1862. Queen Victoria, still in mourning for her consort Prince Albert, did not attend; instead her cousin the Duke of Cambridge presided from a throne sited beneath the western dome. An opening address was delivered by the Earl Granville, chairman of Her Majesty&#x27;s Commissioners, the group responsible for the organisation of the event.

There were 39 participating countries, and a total of 6,096,617 visitors attended the exhibition. Receipts (£459,632) were slightly above cost (£458,842), leaving a total profit of £790. An official closing ceremony took place on 1 November 1862, but the exhibition remained open to the public until 15 November 1862.

== Buildings ==
The exhibition was held in South Kensington, London, on a site covering , and now occupied by the Natural History Museum. The buildings, which occupied , were designed by Captain Francis Fowke of the Royal Engineers, and built by Lucas Brothers and Sir John Kelk. They took only 11 months to build. They were intended to be permanent, and were constructed in an un-ornamented style with the intention of adding decoration in later years as funds allowed. Much of the construction was of cast-iron, 12,000 tons worth, though façades were brick. Picture galleries occupied three sides of a rectangle on the south side of the site; the largest, with a frontage on the Cromwell Road, was long, high and wide, with a grand triple-arched entrance.

Fowke paid particular attention to lighting pictures in a way that would eliminate glare. Behind the picture galleries were the &quot;Industrial Buildings&quot; . These were composed of &quot;naves&quot; and &quot;transepts&quot;, lit by tall clerestories, with the spaces in the angles between them filled by glass-roofed courts. Above the brick entrances on the east and west fronts were two great glass domes, each 150 feet wide and 260 feet high - at that time the largest domes ever built. The timber-framed &quot;Machinery Galleries&quot;, the only parts of the structure intended to be temporary, stretched further north along Prince Consort Road.

Parliament declined the Government&#x27;s wish to purchase the building and the materials were sold and used for the construction of Alexandra Palace.

==Exhibitions==

The exhibition was a showcase of the advances made in the industrial revolution, especially in the decade since the Great Exhibition of 1851. Among the items on display were:
*the electric telegraph
* submarine cables
* the first plastic
*Parkesine
* machine tools
* looms
* precision instruments
* Charles Babbage&#x27;s analytical engine
* cotton mills
* maritime engines (made by Henry Maudslay and Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes)
* stained-glass windows by French artist Charles-Laurent Maréchal

There was also a range of smaller goods including fabrics, rugs, sculptures, furniture, plates, porcelain, silver and glass wares, and wallpaper.

The manufacture of ice by an early refrigerator caused a sensation.

The work shown by William Morris&#x27;s decorative arts firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. attracted much notice.

The exposition also introduced the use of caoutchouc for rubber production and the Bessemer process for steel manufacture.

Benjamin Simpson showed photos from the Indian subcontinent.

William England led a team of stereoscopic photographers, which included William Russell Sedgfield and Stephen Thompson, to produce a series of 350 stereo views of the exhibition for the London Stereoscopic Company. The images were made using the new collodion wet plate process which allowed exposure times of only a few seconds. These images provide a vivid three-dimensional record of the exhibition. They were on sale to the public in boxed sets and were delivered to the Queen by messenger so that she could experience the exhibition from her seclusion in mourning.

The London and North Western Railway exhibited one of their express passenger locomotives, No. 531 &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;. A sister locomotive, No. 229 &quot;Watt&quot; had famously carried Trent Affair despatches earlier that year, but the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; (which won a bronze medal at the exhibition) was so popular that the entire class of locomotive became known as &quot;Ladies of the Lake&quot;. The manufacturing Lilleshall Company exhibited a 2-2-2 express passenger locomotive.

There was an extensive art gallery designed to allow an even light without reflection on the pictures.

The exhibition also included an international chess tournament, the London 1862 chess tournament.

A large tiger skin, from a tiger shot in 1860 by Colonel Charles Reid, was exhibited here. The skin was mounted by Edwin H. Ward and subsequently became &quot;The Leeds Tiger&quot;, still on display at Leeds City Museum, UK.

== Music ==

Unlike the Great Exhibition of 1851, the Society of Arts chose to have a distinctive musical component to the exhibition of 1862. Music critic Henry Chorley was selected as advisor, and recommended commissioning works by William Sterndale Bennett, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Daniel Auber, and Gioacchino Rossini. Being in his retirement, Rossini declined, so the Society asked Giuseppe Verdi, who eventually accepted.

William Sterndale Bennett wrote his &quot;Ode Written Expressly for the Opening of the International Exhibition&quot; (upon a text by Alfred, Lord Tennyson), Meyerbeer wrote his &quot;Fest-Ouvertüre im Marschstil&quot;, and Auber wrote his &quot;Grand triumphal march&quot;. These three works premiered at the opening of the exhibition on 1 May 1862, with the orchestra led by conductor Prosper Sainton. Controversies involving Verdi&#x27;s contribution, the cantata &quot;Inno delle nazioni&quot;, prevented the work from being included in the inaugural concert. It was first performed on 24 May 1862 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in a concert organized by James Henry Mapleson.

At another concert, the French pianist and composer Georges Pfeiffer created his Second Piano Concerto.

The pianist Ernst Pauer performed daily piano recitals on the stage under the western dome.

==Accident==
At the opening of the exhibition on 1 May 1862, one of the attending Members of the British Parliament, 70-year-old Robert Aglionby Slaney, fell onto the ground through a gap between floorboards on a platform. He carried on with his visit despite an injured leg, but died from gangrene that set in on the 19th.

==Legacy==
The exhibition buildings were dismantled and the materials used to construct Alexandra Palace.

The exhibition eclipsed the previous two exhibitions in size and scale, but did not attract as many visitors as aimed for (11 million).

Fowke posited the idea of a new museum of natural history to be built on the former site of the Exhibition Palace in 1864. The idea was taken up by the government, and in 1881 the Natural History Museum was inaugurated. The Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum were also built on the exhibition site.

<text>USS &quot;Stephen W. Groves&quot; (FFG-29), twenty-first ship of the of guided missile frigates, was named for Ensign Stephen W. Groves (1917–1942), a naval aviator who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism at the Battle of Midway during World War II.

==Namesake==
Stephen William Groves was born on 29 January 1917 in Millinocket, Maine. He graduated from Schenck High School in East Millinocket, Maine, and received a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Maine in 1939.

He joined the U.S. Navy in December 1940 and was commissioned in August 1941. He joined the aircraft carrier in December 1941. During the Battle of Midway, took off nine times from , his was one of six American fighters that fought off a vastly superior Japanese force that was trying to finish off the damaged carrier on 4 June 1942. The U.S. fighters were credited with shooting down 14 Japanese planes and causing six others to retreat.

Groves was declared missing and presumed dead on 5 June 1942. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. The destroyer escort USS &quot;Groves&quot; (DE-543) was named for him, but its construction was cancelled in 1944. The American Legion Post in East Millinocket is named the Feeney-Groves Post, partially in his memory.

==Construction and career==
Ordered from Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 23 January 1978 as part of the FY78 program, &quot;Stephen W. Groves&quot; was laid down on 16 September 1980, launched on 4 April 1981, and commissioned on 17 April 1982.

&quot;Stephen W. Groves&quot; (FFG-29) is the first ship of that name in the U.S. Navy. A previous ship named for Ensign Groves, destroyer escort, , was canceled in 1944 prior to completion. Assigned to Destroyer Squadron 14 and home-ported at Naval Station Mayport, Florida.

During her maiden voyage, &quot;Groves&quot; was assigned to units in support of US Marines stationed at the airport in Beirut, Lebanon. Arriving shortly after the barracks bombing in 1983, she was assigned to host the helicopter detachment from , enabling &quot;New Jersey&quot; to utilize all three of her turrets for attacking targets in the Beqaa Valley. Additionally, &quot;Groves&quot; protected &quot;New Jersey&quot; and other surface units from air threats. She tracked unidentified submarines, monitored Yasser Arafat&#x27;s transit from Beirut to Cyprus, and entered Beirut harbor with other units to conduct direct fire support against units hostile to USMC positions. &quot;Groves&quot; was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation for these actions.

She was also on station when the frigate was struck by two missiles from an Iraqi fighter jet, and assisted &quot;Stark&quot; in her return to Mayport, Florida.

In September 2003, while patrolling in the Eastern Pacific &quot;Stephen W. Groves&quot; captured a go-fast drug smuggling boat along with its six crewmembers. 1.5 tons of cocaine was recovered from the ocean after it had been dumped into the sea by the go-fast&#x27;s crew.

On 28 August 2005, she sailed from her then-home port of Pascagoula, Mississippi, along with sister ship , under threat from Hurricane Katrina.

Deployed to the Indian Ocean, on 10 May 2011 she intercepted the Taiwanese longliner &quot;Jih Chun Tsai 68&quot;, which had been hijacked by Somalian pirates. Receiving fire from the fishing vessel, &quot;Stephen W. Groves&quot; engaged her in a single ship action that saw the pirate vessel sunk with three pirates killed, two wounded, and one Taiwanese hostage killed. Nineteen Somali pirates and two Chinese hostages were taken on board. The rescued Chinese crew were repatriated to China and their families. She was decommissioned on 24 February 2012 and was moved to Brownsville, Texas for deconstruction and recycling to be completed in 2021.

<doc id="250219" wikidata="Q1095680" url="?curid=250219" title="Clark Blaise">
<text>Clark Blaise, OC (born April 10, 1940) is a Canadian-American author. He was a professor of creative writing at York University, and a writer of short fiction. In 2010, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.

== Early life and education ==
Blaise was born in Fargo, North Dakota, to Canadian parents who lived in the United States. His mother, Anne Marion Vanstone, was English-Canadian and from Wawanesa, Manitoba, and his father, Leo Romeo Blaise, was of French-Canadian descent and was a furniture salesman and long-distance traveller. Later on, his father would inspire the father characters in Blaise&#x27;s fiction. Growing up, his family moved constantly throughout the U.S. Before the eighth grade, he had already moved 30 times; ultimately, he attended 25 different schools. From ages six to ten, he lived in Florida. Throughout his childhood, Blaise also lived in Alabama, Georgia, communities in the American Midwest, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Winnipeg. When Blaise was nineteen, his parents divorced.

He attended Denison University and the University of Iowa, graduating in 1961 and 1964 respectively. While at Denison University, he initially intended to pursue a major in geology but switched to English after taking a writing course in which he studied under Paul Bennett. While studying at Denison, he read extensively, began writing book reviews for the weekly newspaper, helped edit campus literary magazines, and received several campus writing awards.

== Career ==
In 1966, Blaise moved to Montreal and obtained Canadian citizenship. While living in Canada, Blaise published his first two short fiction collections, &quot;A North American Education&quot; (1973) and &quot;Tribal Justice&quot; (1974)&quot;.&quot;

Blaise was the director of the International Writing Program. While living in Montreal in the early 1970s, he taught creative writing at Concordia University; he also joined with authors Raymond Fraser, Hugh Hood, John Metcalf and Ray Smith to form the Montreal Story Tellers Fiction Performance Group. Blaise and his wife Bharati Mukherjee collaborated on a memoir of experiences in India which was published in 1978.

In 1978, Blaise and Mukherjee moved to Toronto. Blaise became a professor of creative writing at York University, and wrote his first novel.

Mukherjee felt excluded in Canada, attributing it to racism and publishing an essay in &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. In 1980, the couple decided to return to the United States, moving to San Francisco. Both continued their literary careers, including a collaborative analysis of the 1985 bombing of Air India flight 182, known in India as the Kanishka bombing. Blaise wrote two more novels and a number of short stories.

== Personal life ==
He married writer Bharati Mukherjee in 1963. They met as students at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa and had two sons. Mukherjee died in 2017. Blaise lives in New York.

== Honours and awards ==
In 2009, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions to Canadian letters as an author, essayist, teacher, and founder of the post-graduate program in creative writing at Concordia University&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Reid&quot; (FFG-30), twenty-second ship of the of guided-missile frigates, was named for Sailing Master Samuel Chester Reid (1783–1861).

Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California on 23 January 1978 as part of the FY78 program, &quot;Reid&quot; was laid down on 8 October 1980, launched on 27 June 1981, sponsored by Mrs. William C. Abhau, her daughter Miss Elliot Abhau assisting, Mrs. Abhau is the great-great-granddaughter of Sailing Master Chester Reid, and commissioned on 19 February 1983.

On 18 August 1990, &quot;Reid&quot; fired the first shots of Operation Desert Shield when she fired across the bow of an Iraqi tanker who had refused to change course when ordered.

The Reid&#x27;s unofficial nickname &quot;Reidski&quot;, used during the 1980s, came into use as &quot;Reid&quot; found herself, more often than not, playing on the side of the &quot;orange&quot; team during fleet exercises.

== TCG &quot;Gelibolu&quot; (F 493) ==
Decommissioned &amp; stricken on 25 September 1998, she was transferred to Turkey on 5 January 1999 as that nation&#x27;s TCG &quot;Gelibolu&quot; (F 493). As of 2023, she is still in active service.

<text>The Mazda RX-7 is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, rotary engine-powered sports car, manufactured and marketed by Mazda from 1978 through 2002 across three generations, all of which incorporated use of a compact, lightweight Wankel rotary engine.

The first-generation RX-7, sometimes referred to as the SA (early) and FB (late), is a two-seater two-door hatchback coupé. It featured a 12A carbureted rotary engine as well as the option for a 13B rotary engine with electronic fuel injection in later years.

The second-generation RX-7, sometimes referred to as the FC, was offered as a two-seater coupé with a 2+2 option available in some markets, as well as in a convertible body style. This was powered by the 13B rotary engine, offered in naturally aspirated or turbocharged forms.

The third-generation RX-7, sometimes referred to as the FD, was offered a 2+2-seater coupé with a limited run of a two-seater option. Some markets were only available as a two-seater. It featured a sequentially turbocharged 13B REW engine.

More than 800,000 RX-7s were manufactured over its lifetime.


== First generation (SA, FB)==
===Series 1 (1978–1980)===
Series 1 (produced from 1978 until 1980) is commonly referred to as the &quot;SA22C&quot; from the first alphanumeric of the vehicle identification number. Mazda&#x27;s internal project number for what was to become the RX-7 was X605. In Japan, it was introduced in March 1978, replacing the Savanna RX-3, and joined Mazda&#x27;s only other remaining rotary engine-powered products, called the Cosmo which was a two-door luxury coupé, and the Luce luxury sedan.

The lead designer at Mazda was , whose son, , would go on to design the Mazda2 and the RX-7&#x27;s successor, the RX-8. The transition of the Savanna to a sports car appearance reflected products from other Japanese manufacturers. The advantage the RX-7 had was its minimal size and weight, and the compact rotary engine installed behind the front axle helped balance the front and rear weight distribution, which provided a low center of gravity.

In May 1980, Mazda introduced a limited production run of special North American models known as the Leathersport Models. This package was essentially an uprated GS model with added LS badges on each B-pillar, special stripes on the exterior, and LS-only gold anodized wheels (with polished outer face and wheel rim). All LS editions came equipped with special LS-only full brown leather upholstery, leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather-wrapped shift knob, removable sunroof, LS-specific four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio with power antenna (though listed as a six-speaker stereo, as the two rear dual voice coil speakers were counted as four speakers in total), remote power door side mirrors, and other standard GS equipment. Two primary options were also available; a three-speed JATCO 3N71B automatic transmission and air conditioning. The dealer could add other GS options such as a cassette tape deck, splash guards, padded center console arm rest, and others. The LS model was only ever available in three different exterior colors: Aurora White, Brilliant Black, and Solar Gold. No official production records are known to exist or to have been released. This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located rear license plate, called by Werner Buhler of &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine a &quot;Baroque depression.&quot;

===Series 2 (1981–1983)===
The Series 2, referred to as the FB (produced from 1981 to 1983), had integrated plastic-covered bumpers, wide black rubber body side moldings, wraparound taillights and updated engine control components. While marginally longer overall, the new model was lighter in federalized trim. The four-speed manual option was dropped for 1981 as well, while the gas tank grew larger and the dashboard was redesigned, including a shorter gear stick mounted closer to the driver. In 1983, the speedometer returned for the RX-7. The GSL package provided optional four-wheel disc brakes, front ventilated (Australian model) and clutch-type rear limited-slip differential (LSD). This revision of the SA22 was known in North America as the &quot;FB&quot; after the US Department of Transportation mandated 17-digit Vehicle Identification Number changeover. For various other markets worldwide, the 1981–1985 RX-7 retained the &#x27;SA22C&#x27; VIN prefix. In the UK, the 1978–1980 series 1 cars carried the SA code on the VIN but all later cars (1981–1983 series 2 and 1984–1985 series 3) carried the FB code and these first-generation RX-7s are known as the &quot;FB&quot; only in North America.

In Japan, a very well appointed version similar to the export market GSL arrived late in 1982, called the SE-Limited. This model received two-tone paint, alloy wheels shaped like the Wankel rotor, all-wheel disc brakes, limited-slip differential, and a full leather interior. It also had the latest iteration of the 12A rotary engine, the RE-6PI with variable induction port system and .

In Europe, the FB was mainly noticed for having received a power increase from the of the SA22; the 1981 RX-7 now had on tap. European market cars also received four-wheel disc brakes as standard.

In 1984, Mazda Australia decided to produce a convertible by joining an RX-7 front body with a 626 coupee rear end. To ensure rigidity, steel channel beams were welded to the floor pan. Due to the added weight, the engine used was the Japanese model 12AT introduced in 1983 rated at at 6,500rpm. It was planned and budgeted to build 80 cars per year. However, after the first production run of six, Mazda Japan became aware of the project and ended it; intending in 1985 to introduce the Second Generation increased-size RX-7 with the larger, more powerful 13B engine. This would include a convertible model for worldwide sales. Thus, the Series 2 convertible is the rarest Mazda car built.

===Series 3 (1984–1985)===

The Series 3 (produced 1984–1985) featured an updated lower front fascia. North American models received a different instrument cluster. GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a fuel injected 13B RE-EGI engine rated at and . GSL-SE models had much the same options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3mm (4x4.5&quot;). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external oil cooler was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial &quot;beehive&quot; water-oil heat exchanger.

The 1984 RX-7 GSL has an estimated 29 MPG (8.11 litres/100 km) highway/19 MPG (12.37 L/100 km) city. According to Mazda, its rotary engine, licensed by NSU-Wankel allowed the RX-7 GSL to accelerate from 0 to 80  km/h (50  mph) in 6.3 seconds.

In 1985, Mazda introduced the RX-7 Finale in Australia. This was the last of the series and brought out in limited numbers. The Finale featured power options and a brass plaque mentioning the number the car was as well as &quot;Last of a legend&quot; on the plaque. The finale had special stickers and a blacked out section between the window &amp; rear hatch.

The handling and acceleration of the car were noted to be of a high caliber for its day. The RX-7 had &quot;live axle&quot; 4-link rear suspension with Watt&#x27;s linkage, a 50:50 front and rear weight distribution, and weighed under . It was the lightest generation of the RX-7 ever produced. 12A-powered models accelerated from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) in 9.2 seconds, and turned 0.779 &quot;g&quot; (7.64 m/s²) laterally on a skid pad. The 12A engine was rated at at 6,000 rpm in North American models, allowing the car to reach speeds of over . Because of the smoothness inherent in the Wankel rotary engine, little vibration or harshness was experienced at high engine speeds, so a buzzer was fitted to the tachometer to warn the driver when the 7,000 rpm redline was approaching.

The 12A engine has a long thin shaped combustion chamber, having a large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An engine-driven pump supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This is done in the &quot;thermal reactor&quot; chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions, the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner-burning of the air/fuel mixture.

Options and models varied from country to country. The gauge layout and interior styling in the Series 3 was only changed for the North American models. Additionally, North America was the only market to have offered the first generation of the RX-7 with the fuel-injected 13B, model GSL-SE. Sales of the first-generation RX-7 were strong, with a total of 474,565 cars produced; 377,878 (nearly eighty percent) were sold in the United States alone.

===RX-7 Turbo===
Following the introduction of the first turbocharged rotary engine in the Luce/Cosmo, a similar, also fuel injected and non-intercooled 12A turbocharged engine was made available for the top-end model of the Series 3 RX-7 in Japan. It was introduced in September 1983. The engine was rated at (JIS) at 6,500 rpm. While the peak power figures were only slightly higher than those of the engine used in the Luce/Cosmo, the new &quot;Impact Turbo&quot; was developed specifically to deal with the different exhaust gas characteristics of a rotary engine. Both rotor vanes of the turbine were remodeled and made smaller, and the turbine had a twenty percent higher speed than a turbo intended for a conventional engine. The Savanna Turbo was short-lived, as the next generation of the RX-7 was about to be introduced.
== Second generation (FC) ==

The second-generation RX-7 (sometimes referred to as &quot;FC&quot;, VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still known as the Mazda Savanna RX-7 in Japan, featured a complete restyling much like similar sports cars of the era such as the Nissan 300ZX. Mazda&#x27;s development team, led by Chief Project Engineer , chose to focus on the American market when designing the FC, where the majority of first-generation of the RX-7 models had been sold. The team drew inspiration from successful sports cars that were popular at the time, such as studying the suspension design of the Porsche 928.

While the first-generation RX-7 was a purer sports car, the second-generation RX-7 tended toward the softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some similarities with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with less of the oversteer tendencies of the previous version. The rear end design was vastly improved from the SA22&#x27;s live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with rack and pinion steering replacing the old recirculating-ball steering of the SA22. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUˢ, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the FC. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5g or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. Another new feature was the Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS). The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects.

In Japan, a limited edition of the second-generation RX-7 called Infini was available with production limited to only 600 cars for each year. Some special noted features for all Infini series are: infini logo on the rear, upgraded suspension, upgraded ECU, higher power output of the engine, reduced weight, 15-inch BBS aluminum alloy wheels, Infini logo steering wheel, aero bumper kits, bronze-colored window glass, floor bar on the passenger side, aluminum bonnet with scoop, and front strut bar. The car was thought as the pinnacle of the RX-7 series (until the introduction of the third generation RX-7). The Infini IV came with other special items such as black bucket seats, 16-inch BBS wheels, Knee pads, and all the other items mentioned before. There are differing years for the Infini, which denoted the series. Series I was introduced in 1987, Series II was introduced in 1988, Series III was introduced in 1989, and Series IV was introduced in 1990. Series I and II came in White or Black exterior colour, Series III came in Shade Green only, and Series IV came in Shade Green or Noble Green exterior colours. There are only minor differences between the Series models, the biggest change which was from the Series I and II being an S4 and the Series III and IV being an S5.

The Turbo II model uses a turbocharger with a twin-scroll design pumping out 33 percent more power than the naturally aspirated counterpart. The Turbo II also has an air-to-air intercooler which has a dedicated intake on the hood. The intake is slightly offset toward the left side of the hood. In the Japanese market, only the turbocharged engine was available; the naturally-aspirated version was only available for select export markets. This can be attributed to insurance companies in many Western nations penalizing turbocharged cars (thus restricting potential sales). The Japanese market car produces in the original version; this engine was upgraded to in April 1989 as part of the Series 5 facelift. The limited edition, two-seater Infini model received a version beginning in June 1990, thanks to an upgraded exhaust system and high-octane fuel.

Australian Motors Mazda introduced a limited run of 250 &#x27;Sports&#x27; model Series 4 RX-7s; each with no power steering, power windows or rear wiper as an attempt to reduce the weight of the car.

The Haraguchi RX-7 is a legendary vehicle in the world of drifting, often hailed as an iconic representation of the drift culture that emerged in the 1990s. Built by Mitsuru Haraguchi between 1989 and 1993, this Series 2 RX-7 became famous for its unique style and performance, making it one of the earliest examples of what enthusiasts would come to call a &quot;HotBoi&quot; drift car—a term used to describe cars modified for drifting with an emphasis on aesthetic appeal. Mitsuru Haraguchi was not just a driver; he was a key figure in the underground drifting scene in Japan. The RX-7, with its lightweight body and rotary engine, proved to be an ideal platform for the kind of driving that would push the envelope in terms of control and style. The car was extensively modified for performance, featuring upgrades to its suspension, tires, and engine to suit the demands of drifting. The RX-7&#x27;s aesthetic was also significant. It showcased a vibrant design that captured the spirit of the drifting scene, often adorned with bold graphics and a striking color scheme that made it instantly recognizable. Tragically, the Haraguchi RX-7 met an unfortunate fate when it was crashed in 1999, yet its impact on the drifting community has been profound. The crash, rather than marking the end of its story, solidified its legendary status. It has since been celebrated in various media, including magazines, videos, and online forums, where enthusiasts pay homage to its legacy. Even today, the legacy of the Haraguchi RX-7 influences the design and customization of drift cars around the world. It remains a symbol of innovation within the drifting culture, representing the fusion of performance driving with creative expression through automotive art.

===Convertible===

Mazda introduced a convertible version of the RX-7, the FC3C, in 1988 with a naturally aspirated engine—introduced to the US market with ads featuring actor James Garner, at the time featured in many Mazda television advertisements. Only about 22,000 convertibles were built.

The convertible featured a removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding fabric rear section with heated rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching over to the right-side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers—thereby extending the driving season for the car with the top retracted. The convertible also featured optional headrest-mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit—a first in convertible production.

Production ceased in 1991 after Mazda marketed a limited run of 500 examples for 1992 for the domestic market only. In markets outside the US, only the turbocharged version of the convertible was available.

===North America===
The Series 4 (produced for the 1986 through the 1988 model years) was available with a naturally aspirated, fuel injected 13B-VDEI producing in North American spec. An optional turbocharged model, known as the Turbo II in the American market, was rated at and of torque at 3,500 rpm. The turbo model was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1986, with a target of 20 percent of overall RX-7 sales.

The Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated styling and better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a higher compression ratio 9.7:1 for the naturally aspirated model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The naturally aspirated Series 5&#x27;s 13B-DEI engine was rated at , while the Series 5 Turbo was rated at at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 3,500 rpm.

Mazda sold 86,000 RX-7s in the US alone in 1986, its first model year, with sales peaking in 1988.

====1988 10th Anniversary RX-7====

Mazda introduced the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a limited production model based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 units. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side moldings, tail light housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy seven-spoke wheels. There were two &quot;series&quot; of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series can be found on the exterior- the earlier &quot;Series I&quot; cars had a black &quot;Mazda&quot; logo decal on the front bumper cover, whereas most if not all &quot;Series II&quot; cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower seat cushion height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the bright gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, but the door panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed horn button) and MOMO leather-wrapped shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages. Other 10th Anniversary Edition specific items were headlight washers (the only RX-7 in the US market that got this feature), glass breakage detectors added to the factory alarm system, 10th Anniversary Edition logoed floor mats, 10th Anniversary Edition embroidered front hood protector and accompanying front end mask (or &quot;bra&quot;), and an aluminum under pan.

====GTUˢ (1989–1990)====
In 1989, with the introduction of the facelifted FC RX-7, and to commemorate the RX-7s 8 straight wins in the IMSA GTU class from 1980 to 1987, Mazda introduced a limited model labeled the GTUˢ. Starting with the lightweight base model GTU, the GTUˢ added items found on the Turbo model such as four-piston front brakes, ventilated rear brake rotors, vehicle speed-sensing power steering, one-piece front chin spoiler, cloth-covered Turbo model seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch wheels, 205/55VR tires, and a GTUˢ-only 4.300 viscous-type limited-slip differential (all other FC LSD&#x27;s were 4.100). This allowed quicker acceleration from the naturally aspirated 13B rotary engine. Although it has been rumored that Mazda built between 100 and 1100 GTUˢ&#x27; between 1989 and 1990, there is no official documentation from Mazda on how many have been built. The most reliable way to determine a GTUˢ is by taking the VIN to a Mazda dealer and they can look to see if the internal coding for the car comes up as a GS model designation.
== Third generation (FD) ==

The third-generation RX7, (sometimes referred to as FD, chassis code FD3S for Japan and JM1FD for the North America), featured an updated body design. Announced in October 1991, production began later that month before going on sale in December in the domestic Japanese market. Left-Hand-Drive export production began shortly after. The 13B-REW engine was the first-ever mass-produced sequential twin-turbocharger system to be exported from Japan, boosting power to in 1992 and finally to by the time production ended in Japan in 2002.

For the third-generation RX-7, Mazda organized an internal design competition between its four design studios in Hiroshima, Yokohama, Irvine, and Europe. The winning design came from their Design Center in Irvine and was designed by Taiwanese automotive artist Wu-huang Chin (), who also worked on the Mazda MX-5 Miata, with help from Tom Matano. The interior design, though, originated from the Hiroshima design proposal. Mazda&#x27;s chief designer then helped take the concept design to its final production form.

In Japan, sales were affected by this series&#x27; non-compliance with Japanese dimension regulations and Japanese buyers paid annual taxes for the car&#x27;s non-compliant width. As the RX7 was now considered an upper-level luxury sports car due to the increased width dimensions, Mazda also offered two smaller offerings, the Eunos Roadster, and the Eunos Presso hatchback.

The sequential twin-turbocharging system, introduced in 1992, was extremely complex and was developed with the aid of Hitachi. It was previously used on the exclusive-to-Japan Cosmo JC Series. The system used two turbochargers, one to provide of boost from 1,800 rpm. The second turbocharger activated in the upper half of the rpm range, during full-throttle acceleration – at 4,000 rpm to maintain until redline. The changeover process occurred at 4,500 rpm, with a momentary dip in pressure to , and provided semi-linear acceleration from a wide torque curve throughout the entire rev range under normal operation.

Under high-speed-driving conditions, the changeover process produced a significant increase in power output and forced technical drivers to adjust their driving style to anticipate and mitigate any over-steer during cornering. The standard turbo control system used 4 control solenoids, 4 actuators, both a vacuum and pressure chamber, and several feet of preformed vacuum/pressure hoses, all of which were prone to failure in part due to complexity and the inherent high temperatures of the rotary engine.

Information about various trims and models is listed as follows:
===Series 6 (1992–1995)===

Series 6 was exported throughout the world and sold in larger numbers than in later years. In Japan, Mazda sold the RX-7 through its ɛ̃fini brand as the ɛ̃fini RX-7. Models in Japan included the Type S, the base model, Type R, the lightweight sports model, Type RZ, Type RB, A-spec and the Touring X, which came with a four-speed automatic transmission. The RX-7 was sold in 1993–1995 in the U.S. and Canada. The Series 6 was rated at and .

====North American market====
At launch, three option packages were offered; the unlabeled base model, the Touring and the R1 (renamed R2 in 1994). All cars were only available as a two-seater, unlike the previous generation which offered a 2+2 configuration in North America. All cars were equipped with the same sequential twin-turbo 13B REW engine. A five-speed manual transmission was standard and a 4-speed automatic was available on the base model and Touring package. A driver-side airbag and anti-lock brakes are standard as well. The Touring package included a glass moonroof, fog lights, leather seats, a rear window wiper and a Bose Acoustic Wave music system with CD player. The R1 (R2 in 1994–95) model featured upgraded springs, Bilstein shocks, an additional engine oil cooler, an aerodynamics package comprising a front lip and rear wing, suede seats and Pirelli Z-rated tires. Cruise control was deleted on the R1. The R2 differed from the R1 in that it had slightly softer suspension.

In 1994, the interior received a small update to include a passenger-side air bag, and a PEG (popular equipment group) package was offered. The PEG package featured leather seats, a rear cargo cover and a power steel sunroof. It did not include the fog lights or Bose stereo of the touring package. An automatic transmission was not available with the PEG.

In 1995, the Touring package was replaced by the PEP (popular equipment package). The PEP included a rear wing, leather seats, sunroof and fog lights, but didn&#x27;t have the Bose Stereo nor the rear window wiper. An estimated 500 RX-7s were produced for the 1995 model year. This would be the final year of RX-7 production for North America, as it was discontinued due to slow sales.

====Australian market====
A special high-performance version of the RX-7 was introduced in Australia in 1995, named the RX-7 SP. This model was developed to achieve homologation for racing in the Australian GT Production Car Series and the Eastern Creek 12 Hour production car race. An initial run of 25 cars were made, and later an extra 10 were built by Mazda due to demand. The RX-7 SP was rated at and of torque, a substantial increase over the standard model. Other changes included a race-developed carbon fiber nose cone and rear spoiler, a carbon fibre fuel tank (as opposed to the tank in the standard car), a 4.3:1 final drive ratio, 17-inch wheels, larger brake rotors and calipers. A &quot;three times more efficient&quot; intercooler, a new exhaust, and a modified ECU were also included. Weight was reduced significantly with the aid of further carbon fibre usage including lightweight vented bonnet and Recaro seats to reduce weight to (from ) making this model road-going race car that matched the performance of the rival Porsche Carrera RS Club Sport for the final year Mazda officially entered. The formula paid off when the RX-7 SP won the 1995 Eastern Creek 12 Hour, giving Mazda the winning 12-hour trophy for a fourth straight year. The winning car also gained a podium finish at the international tarmac rally Targa Tasmania months later. A later special version, the Bathurst R, was introduced in 2001 to commemorate this victory in Japan only. It was based on the RX-7 Type R and 500 were built in total, featuring adjustable dampers, a carbon fibre shift knob, carbon fibre interior trim, special fog lamps and a different parking brake lever.
====European market====
In Europe, only 1,152 examples of the FD were sold through the official Mazda network, due to a high price and a fairly short time span. Only one model was available and it included twin oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the rear storage bins in place of the back seats. It also has the stiffer suspension and strut braces from the R models. Germany topped the sales with 446 cars, while UK is second at 210 and Greece third with 168 (thanks to that country&#x27;s tax structure which favored the rotary engine). The European models also received the 1994 interior facelift, with a passenger air bag. Sales in most of Europe ended after 1995 as it would have been too expensive to reengineer the car to meet the new Euro 2 emissions regulations.

=====United Kingdom=====
In the United Kingdom, for 1992, customers were offered only one version of the FD, which was based on a combination of the US touring and the base model. For the following year, in a bid to speed up sales, Mazda reduced the price of the RX-7 to £25,000, down from £32,000, and refunded the difference to those who bought the car before that was announced. From 1992 to 1995, only 210 FD RX-7s were officially sold in the UK. The FD continued to be imported to the UK until 1996. In 1998, for a car that had suffered from slow sales when it was officially sold, with a surge of interest and the benefit of a newly introduced SVA scheme, the FD would become so popular that there were more parallel and grey imported models brought into the country than Mazda UK had ever imported.

===Series 7 (1996–1998)===
Series 7 included minor changes to the car. Updates included a simplified vacuum routing manifold and a 16-bit ECU which combined with an improved intake system netted an extra . This additional horsepower was only available on manual transmission cars as the increase in power was only seen above 7,000 rpm, which was the redline for automatic transmission equipped cars. The rear spoiler and tail lights were also redesigned. The Type RZ model was now equipped with larger brake rotors as well as 17-inch BBS wheels. In Japan, the Series 7 RX-7 was marketed under the Mazda and ɛ̃fini brand name.

Series 7 RX-7s were also sold in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Series 7 models were produced only with right-hand drive (RHD), and were only exported to RHD markets.

===Series 8 (1998–2002)===
Series 8 was the final series, and was only available in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were available on certain models, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling was made possible by a redesigned front fascia with larger openings. The seats, steering wheel, and instrument cluster were all changed. The rear spoiler was modified and gained adjustability on certain models. Three horsepower levels are available: for automatic transmission equipped cars, for the Type RB, and available on the top-of-the-line sporting models.

The high-end &quot;Type RS&quot; came equipped with Bilstein suspension and 17-inch wheels as standard equipment, and reduced weight to . Power was increased with the addition of a less restrictive muffler and more efficient turbochargers which featured abradable compressor seals, at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm as per the maximum Japanese limit. The Type RS had a brake upgrade by increasing rotor diameter front and rear to and front rotor thickness from to . The Type RS version also sported a 4.30 final drive ratio, providing a significant reduction in its 0– time. The gearbox was also modified, fifth gear was made longer to reduce cruising rpm and improve fuel efficiency. The very limited edition Type RZ version included all the features of the Type RS, but at a lighter weight, at . It also featured gun-metal colored BBS wheels and a red racing themed interior. An improved ABS system worked by braking differently on each wheel, allowing the car better turning during braking. The effective result made for safer driving for the average buyer.


Easily the most collectible of all the RX-7s was the last model limited to 1,500 units. Dubbed the &quot;Spirit R&quot;, they combined all the extra features Mazda had used on previous limited-run specials with new exclusive features like cross-drilled brake rotors. Sticker prices when new were 3,998,000 yen for Type-A and B and 3,398,000 yen for Type-C. Mazda&#x27;s press release said &quot;The Type-A Spirit R model is the ultimate RX-7, boasting the most outstanding driving performance in its history.&quot;

There are three models of &quot;Spirit R&quot;: the &quot;Type A&quot;, &quot;Type B&quot;, and &quot;Type C&quot;. The &quot;Type A&quot; is a two-seater with a five-speed manual transmission. It features lightweight red trim Recaro front seats as seen in the earlier RZ models. The &quot;Type B&quot; shares all features of the &quot;Type A&quot; but with a 2+2 seat configuration. The &quot;Type C&quot; is also a 2+2, but has a four-speed automatic transmission. Of the 1,504 Spirit R&#x27;s made, 1,044 were Type A, 420 Type B and 40 Type C. An exclusive Spirit R paint color, Titanium Grey, adorned 719 of the 1,504 cars produced.

In Japan the FD3S production span is categorized into six models: #1 from 1991/12, #2 from 1993/08, #3 from 1995/03, #4 from 1996/01, #5 from 1998/12 and #6 from 2000/10. The model number (1 to 6) shows as the first digit of the six-characters-long JDM VIN; e.g., in VIN FD3S-ABCDEF, the A is the model number. A total of nine limited editions (type RZ in 1992/10 (300 cars), RZ 1993/10 (150), R-II Bathurst 1994/09 (350), R Bathurst X 1995/07 (777), RB Bathurst X 1997/01 (700), RS-R 1997/10 (500), RZ 2000/10 (325), R Bathurst R 2001/08 (650), Spirit R 2002/04 (1504)) and two special editions (Bathurst R 1995/02, R Bathurst 2001/12 (2174)) were produced.

==Reviews and awards==
The RX-7 made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list five times (1983, 1987, 1993–1995).

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the Series 3 car seventh on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1970s. In 1983, the RX-7 would appear on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for the first time in 20 years.

Though about heavier and more insulated than its predecessor, the FC continued to win accolades from the press. The RX-7 FC was &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Import Car of the Year for 1986, and the Turbo II was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s 10 Best list for a second time in 1987.

The FD RX-7 was &quot;Motor Trend&#x27;s&quot; Import Car of the Year for 1993. When &quot;Playboy&quot; first reviewed the FD RX-7 in 1993, they tested it in the same issue as the [then] new Dodge Viper. In that issue, &quot;Playboy&quot; declared the RX-7 to be the better of the two cars. It went on to win &quot;Playboy&#x27;s&quot; Car of the Year for 1993.

The FD RX-7 also made &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; Ten Best list for 1993 through 1995 – all three years in which it was sold in the United States. In June 2007, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; proclaimed: &quot;The ace in Mazda&#x27;s sleeve is the RX-7, a car once touted as the purest, most exhilarating sports car in the world.&quot; After its introduction in 1991, it won the Automotive Researchers&#x27; and Journalists&#x27; Conference Car of the Year award in Japan.

Handling in the FD RX-7 was regarded as world-class, and it is still regarded as being one of the finest-handling and best-balanced cars of all time.
==Motorsport==

Racing versions of the first-generation RX-7 were entered at the prestigious 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race. The first outing for the car, equipped with a &quot;13B&quot; engine, failed by less than one second to qualify in 1979. The next year, a &quot;12A&quot;-equipped RX-7 not only qualified, it placed 21st overall. That same car did not finish in 1981, along with two more 13B cars. Those two cars were back for 1982, with one 14th-place finish and another DNF. The RX-7 Le Mans effort was replaced by the 717C prototype for 1983.

Mazda began racing RX-7s in the IMSA GTU series in 1979. In its first year, RX-7s placed first and second at the 24 Hours of Daytona, and claimed the GTU series championship. The car continued winning, claiming the GTU championship seven years in a row. The RX-7 took the GTO championship ten years in a row from 1982. In addition to this, a GTX version was developed, named the Mazda RX-7 GTP; this was unsuccessful, and the GTP version of the car was also unsuccessful. The RX-7 has won more IMSA races than any other car model. In the USA SCCA competition RX-7s were raced with great success by Don Kearney in the NE Division and John Finger in the SE Division. Pettit Racing won the GT2 Road Racing Championship in 1998. The car was a &#x27;93 Mazda RX-7 street car with only bolt-on accessories. At season end Pettit had 140 points—63 points more than the second place team. This same car finished the Daytona Rolex 24-hour race four times.

The RX-7 also fared well at the Spa 24 Hours race. Three Savanna/RX-7s were entered in 1981 by Tom Walkinshaw Racing. After hours of battling with several BMW 530is and Ford Capris, the RX-7 driven by Pierre Dieudonné and Tom Walkinshaw won the event. Mazda had turned the tables on BMW, who had beaten Mazda&#x27;s Familia Rotary to the podium eleven years earlier at the same event. TWR&#x27;s prepared RX-7s also won the British Touring Car Championship in 1980 and 1981, driven by Win Percy.

Canadian-born Australian touring car driver Allan Moffat was instrumental in bringing Mazda into the Australian touring car scene which ran to Group C regulations unique to Australia. Over a four-year span beginning in 1981, Moffat took the Mazda RX-7 to victory in the 1983 Australian Touring Car Championship, as well as a trio of Bathurst 1000 podiums, in 1981 (3rd with Derek Bell), 1983 (second with Yoshimi Katayama) and 1984 (third with former motorcycle champion Gregg Hansford). Privateer racer Peter McLeod drove his RX-7 to win the 1983 Australian Endurance Championship, while Moffat won the Endurance title in 1982 and 1984. Australia&#x27;s adoption of international Group A regulations, combined with Mazda&#x27;s reluctance to homologate a Group A RX-7 (meaning that a base number of 5,000 had to be built, plus another 500 &quot;evolution&quot; models), ended Mazda&#x27;s active participation in Australian touring car racing at the end of the 1984 season. Plans had been in place to replace the RX-7 with a Mazda 929, but testing by Allan Moffat in late 1984 had indicated that the car would be uncompetitive and Mazda abandoned plans to race in Group A.

The RX-7 even made an appearance in the World Rally Championship. The car finished 11th on its debut at the RAC Rally in Wales in 1981. Group B received much of the focus for the first part of the 1980s, but Mazda did manage to place third at the 1985 Acropolis Rally, and when the Group B was folded, its Group A-based replacement, the 323 4WD claimed the victory at Swedish Rally in both 1987 and 1989.

===IMSA Bridgestone Supercar Series===

The third-generation Mazda RX-7 entered its first professional race in the world on February 23, 1992, at the Miami Grand Prix. The cars made it to the podium many times and won the IMSA Supercar race at Sebring in 1994. Peter Farrell Motorsport also fielded RX-7&#x27;s in the IMSA Firestone Firehawk Endurance Series dominating many races and finishing runner up in the overall championship two years in a row.

==Revivals==
Mazda has made several references to a revival of the RX-7 in various forms over the years since the RX-8 was discontinued. In November 2012, MX-5 program manager Nobuhiro Yamamoto indicated that Mazda was working on a 16X based RX-7, with 300 horsepower.
In October 2015, Mazda unveiled the RX-Vision concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show, powered by a new rotary engine and featured design cues reminiscent of the third generation RX-7. A production-ready concept could have followed suit by 2017, marking 50 years since the revealing of Mazda&#x27;s first rotary-powered sports car, the Cosmo.
In October 2023, Mazda unveiled the Iconic SP concept car at the Japan Mobility Show, powered by a two-rotor rotary engine and also features design cues reminiscent of the third generation RX-7, most notably its pop-up headlights.

<doc id="250237" wikidata="Q3458027" url="?curid=250237" title="Effective results in number theory">
<text>For historical reasons and in order to have application to the solution of Diophantine equations, results in number theory have been scrutinised more than in other branches of mathematics to see if their content is effectively computable. Where it is asserted that some list of integers is finite, the question is whether in principle the list could be printed out after a machine computation.

==Littlewood&#x27;s result==

An early example of an ineffective result was J. E. Littlewood&#x27;s theorem of 1914, that in the prime number theorem the differences of both ψ(&quot;x&quot;) and π(&quot;x&quot;) with their asymptotic estimates change sign infinitely often. In 1933 Stanley Skewes obtained an effective upper bound for the first sign change, now known as Skewes&#x27; number.

In more detail, writing for a numerical sequence &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;n&quot;), an &quot;effective&quot; result about its changing sign infinitely often would be a theorem including, for every value of &quot;N&quot;, a value &quot;M&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;N&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;M&quot;) have different signs, and such that &quot;M&quot; could be computed with specified resources. In practical terms, &quot;M&quot; would be computed by taking values of &quot;n&quot; from &quot;N&quot; onwards, and the question is &#x27;how far must you go?&#x27; A special case is to find the first sign change. The interest of the question was that the numerical evidence known showed no change of sign: Littlewood&#x27;s result guaranteed that this evidence was just a small number effect, but &#x27;small&#x27; here included values of &quot;n&quot; up to a billion.

The requirement of computability is reflected in and contrasts with the approach used in the analytic number theory to prove the results. It for example brings into question any use of Landau notation and its implied constants: are assertions pure existence theorems for such constants, or can one recover a version in which 1000 (say) takes the place of the implied constant? In other words, if it were known that there was &quot;M&quot; &gt; &quot;N&quot; with a change of sign and such that

:&quot;M&quot; = O(&quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;))

for some explicit function &quot;G&quot;, say built up from powers, logarithms and exponentials, that means only

:&quot;M&quot; &lt; &quot;A&quot;.&quot;G&quot;(&quot;N&quot;)

for some absolute constant &quot;A&quot;. The value of &quot;A&quot;, the so-called &quot;implied constant&quot;, may also need to be made explicit, for computational purposes. One reason Landau notation was a popular introduction is that it hides exactly what &quot;A&quot; is. In some indirect forms of proof it may not be at all obvious that the implied constant can be made explicit.

==The &#x27;Siegel period&#x27;==

Many of the principal results of analytic number theory that were proved in the period 1900–1950 were in fact ineffective. The main examples were:

*The Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem
*Siegel&#x27;s theorem on integral points, from 1929
*The 1934 theorem of Hans Heilbronn and Edward Linfoot on the class number 1 problem
*The 1935 result on the Siegel zero
* The Siegel–Walfisz theorem based on the Siegel zero.

The concrete information that was left theoretically incomplete included lower bounds for class numbers (ideal class groups for some families of number fields grow); and bounds for the best rational approximations to algebraic numbers in terms of denominators. These latter could be read quite directly as results on Diophantine equations, after the work of Axel Thue. The result used for Liouville numbers in the proof is effective in the way it applies the mean value theorem: but improvements (to what is now the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem) were not.

==Later work==

Later results, particularly of Alan Baker, changed the position. Qualitatively speaking, Baker&#x27;s theorems look weaker, but they have explicit constants and can actually be applied, in conjunction with machine computation, to prove that lists of solutions (suspected to be complete) are actually the entire solution set.

==Theoretical issues==

The difficulties here were met by radically different proof techniques, taking much more care about proofs by contradiction. The logic involved is closer to proof theory than to that of computability theory and computable functions. It is rather loosely conjectured that the difficulties may lie in the realm of computational complexity theory. Ineffective results are still being proved in the shape A &quot;or&quot; B, where we have no way of telling which.

<text>Ecteninion is an extinct genus of meat-eating cynodonts that lived during the Late Triassic (Carnian) in South America. The type species Ecteninion lunensis was named by R.N. Martinez, C.L. May, and C.A. Forster in 1996. &quot;E. lunensis&quot; is known from a nearly complete skull of about in length. It was found in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin in northwestern Argentina. It has been interpreted as a basal eucynodont. The holotype is in the collection of the Universidad Nacional de San Juan.

<doc id="250241" wikidata="Q4271194" url="?curid=250241" title="&quot;Hahnia&quot; obliqua">
<text>&quot;Hahnia&quot; obliqua is a poorly known species of meat-eating stem-mammals (cynodonts) that lived during the Upper Triassic in Europe. It is based on tiny, isolated teeth, and its affinities with other cynodonts are unclear. The generic name is not valid, thus the quotation marks. The name &quot;Hahnia&quot; has already been used for a spider. The authors are aware of this, and will doubtless come up with a new name sometime in the future.

The genus &quot;Hahnia&quot; (&quot;for Hahn&quot;) was named by Pascal Godefroit and Bernard Battail in 1997 based on a single species.

Fossil remains of the species &quot;&quot;Hahnia&quot; obliqua&quot; have been found in the Norian (late) - Rhaetian (early) (Upper Triassic)-age strata of Saint-Nicolas-de-Port in France. Apart from not yet having a proper name, these teeth look rather boring. The crown slopes backwards and has three cusps, though that&#x27;s more apparent when seen from above than it is from the side. The largest cusp, the middle one, has a &quot;somewhat blunt&quot; apex. Its two colleagues, which &quot;are not very well separated from the main cusp&quot;, are &quot;very blunt&quot;, (quotes from Godfroit &amp; Battauk 1997, p. 588). &quot;There is no constriction between the crown and the root.&quot;

Boring looking or not, these were nevertheless effective for cutting up small portions of prey. The authors discuss similarities with teeth of galesaurids (something like forerunners of the eucynodonts), &quot;Cynognathus&quot;, chiniquodontids, tritheledontids, dromatheriids and various other small cynodonts of the European Upper Triassic; They are all carnivores of one size or another. However, as there are also clear differences to the tiny teeth of &quot;Hahnia&quot;, the authors plump for Cynodontia &quot;incertae sedis&quot; (aka of some kind or other).

<text>The human areola (&quot;areola mammae&quot;, or ) is the pigmented area on the breast around the nipple. More generally, an areola is a small circular area on the body with a different histology from the surrounding tissue, or other small circular areas such as an inflamed region of skin.

The mature human female nipple has several small openings arranged radially around the tip of the lactiferous ducts, from which milk is released during lactation. The other small openings in the areola are sebaceous glands, also known as areolar glands.

==Shade==
The areolae can range from pink to red to brown to dark brown or nearly black, but generally tend to be paler among people with lighter skin tones and darker among people with darker skin tones. A reason for the differing color may be to make the nipple area more visible to the infant.

Hyperpigmentation occurs in most women during the second stage of pregnancy, leading to a temporarily darker shade.

==Size and shape==

The size and shape of areolae and nipples are also highly variable, with those of women usually being larger than those of men and prepubescent girls. Human areolae are mostly circular in shape, but many women have large areolae that are noticeably elliptical.

The average diameter of male areolae is around . Sexually mature women have an average of , but sizes can exceed . Lactating women, and women with particularly large breasts, may have even larger areolae. A function of the specialized dermis of the areola is to protect the regular breast skin from wear, cracking, and irritation. Infants sometimes create trauma to the nipple and areolae by latching-on. 

Rated according to the Tanner scale of female physical development, the areolae enlarge during stage 3, but they show no separation of contour. During stage 4, the areolae and papillae rise above breast level and form secondary mounds. By stage 5, the breasts have fully developed. As this has resulted in recession of the areolae, the papillae may reach a little above the breasts&#x27; contour.

Pregnancy can cause enlargement of the areola tissue and of Montgomery glands or tubercles.

==Mechanoreceptors==
Breastfeeding by the baby stimulates slowly and rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region.

==Diseases==
Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast is a malignant condition that outwardly may have the appearance of eczema, with skin changes involving the areola and nipple.

<text>Christian Bök, FRSC (; born August 10, 1966, in Toronto, Canada) is a Canadian poet known for his experimental works. He is the author of &quot;Eunoia&quot;, which won the Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize.

==Life and work==
He was born &quot;Christian Book&quot;, but uses &quot;Bök&quot; as a pseudonym.

He began writing seriously in his early twenties, while earning his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Carleton University in Ottawa. He returned to Toronto in the early 1990s to study for a Ph.D. in English literature at York University, where he encountered a burgeoning literary community that included Steve McCaffery, Christopher Dewdney, and Darren Wershler. Since 2004, he taught at the University of Calgary — but as of 2022, he works as an artist in Melbourne, Australia, and he serves as a Professor (Honorary Appointee) at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia. 

In 1994, Bök published &quot;Crystallography&quot;, &quot;a pataphysical encyclopaedia that misreads the language of poetics through the conceits of geology.&quot; The &quot;Village Voice&quot; said of it: &quot;Bök&#x27;s concise reflections on mirrors, fractals, stones, and ice diabolically change the way you think about language — his, yours — so that what begins as description suddenly seems indistinguishable from the thing itself.&quot; &quot;Crystallography&quot; was reissued in 2003 and was nominated for a Gerald Lampert Award.

Bök is a sound poet, who has performed an extremely condensed version of the &quot;Ursonate&quot; by Kurt Schwitters. He has created conceptual art, making artist&#x27;s books from Rubik&#x27;s Cubes and Lego bricks. He has also worked in science-fiction television by constructing artificial languages for Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Peter Benchley&#x27;s &quot;Amazon&quot;.

===Eunoia===
Bök is most famous for writing &quot;Eunoia&quot; (2001), a book that took him seven years to finish. &quot;Eunoia&quot; consists of univocalic lipograms. The book uses only one vowel in each of its five chapters. In the book&#x27;s main part, each chapter uses just a single vowel, producing sentences such as this: &quot;Enfettered, these sentences repress free speech.&quot; Bök believes that &quot;his book proves that each vowel has its own personality.&quot;

Edited by Darren Wershler and published by Coach House Books in 2001, &quot;Eunoia&quot; won the 2002 Griffin Poetry Prize and sold more than 20,000 copies. Canongate published &quot;Eunoia&quot; in Britain in Oct. 2008. The book was also a bestseller there, reaching #8 on the Top 10 bestselling charts for the year.

===The Xenotext===
&quot;The Xenotext&quot; is an ongoing work of BioArt which claims to be “the first example of ‘living poetry.’” &quot;The Xenotext&quot; consists of a single sonnet (called &quot;Orpheus&quot;), which gets translated into a gene and then integrated into a cell, causing the cell to &quot;read&quot; this poem, and in reply, the cell builds a protein — one whose sequence of amino acids encodes yet another sonnet (called &quot;Eurydice&quot;). The cell becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem. The gene has so far worked properly in cultures of &quot;E. coli&quot;, but the intended symbiote is &quot;D. radiodurans&quot; (&quot;the dire seed, immune to radiation&quot;) — an extremophile, able to thrive in very inhospitable environments, deadly to most life on Earth.

According to Bök from an interview in 2007, the final product will include:

Bök has collaborated with laboratories at the University of Calgary, the University of Wyoming, and the University of Texas (Austin), to realize his design. In 2011, nine years after conceiving &quot;The Xenotext,&quot; Bök announced that labs had performed a successful test run of his “poetic cipher,” meaning that:

In 2015, &quot;The Xenotext: Book I&quot; was published — a work consisting of meditations on both science and poetics (addressing their mythic drives for immortality). This first, &quot;Orphic&quot; volume sets the conceptual groundwork for the second, &quot;Eurydicean&quot; volume, which will document the experiment itself.&quot;The Xenotext: Book II&quot; remains forthcoming.

=== The Kazimir Effect ===
Since 2017, Bök has been working on a lengthy project of visual poetry, inspired by &quot;Suprematist Composition: White on White&quot; by Kazimir Malevich. This project has culminated in the publication of a book entitled &quot;The Kazimir Effect&quot; (Penteract Press, 2021), listed as one of the Times Literary Supplement’s Books of the Year 2021.

==Recognition==
&quot;Eunoia&quot; won the Griffin Poetry Prize in 2002.

Bök&#x27;s poem &quot;Vowels&quot; was used in the lyrics of a song on the EP &quot;A Quick Fix of Melancholy&quot; (2003) by the Norwegian band Ulver.

In 2006, Christian Bök and his work were the subject of an episode of the television series &quot;Heart of a Poet&quot;, produced by Canadian filmmaker Maureen Judge.

On May 31, 2011, The BBC World Service broadcast Bök reading &quot;The Xenotext.&quot;

<text>In mathematical finance, the Greeks are the quantities (known in calculus as partial derivatives; first-order or higher) representing the sensitivity of the price of a derivative instrument such as an option to changes in one or more underlying parameters on which the value of an instrument or portfolio of financial instruments is dependent. The name is used because the most common of these sensitivities are denoted by Greek letters (as are some other finance measures). Collectively these have also been called the risk sensitivities, risk measures or hedge parameters.

==Use of the Greeks==
The Greeks are vital tools in risk management. Each Greek measures the sensitivity of the value of a portfolio to a small change in a given underlying parameter, so that component risks may be treated in isolation, and the portfolio rebalanced accordingly to achieve a desired exposure; see for example delta hedging.

The Greeks in the Black–Scholes model (a relatively simple idealised model of certain financial markets) are relatively easy to calculate — a desirable property of financial models — and are very useful for derivatives traders, especially those who seek to hedge their portfolios from adverse changes in market conditions. For this reason, those Greeks which are particularly useful for hedging—such as delta, theta, and vega—are well-defined for measuring changes in the parameters spot price, time and volatility. Although rho (the partial derivative with respect to the risk-free interest rate) is a primary input into the Black–Scholes model, the overall impact on the value of a short-term option corresponding to changes in the risk-free interest rate is generally insignificant and therefore higher-order derivatives involving the risk-free interest rate are not common.

The most common of the Greeks are the first order derivatives: delta, vega, theta and rho; as well as gamma, a second-order derivative of the value function. The remaining sensitivities in this list are common enough that they have common names, but this list is by no means exhaustive.

The players in the market make competitive trades involving many billions (of $, £ or €) of underlying every day, so it is important to get the sums right. In practice they will use more sophisticated models which go beyond the simplifying assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model and hence in the Greeks.

==Names==
The use of Greek letter names is presumably by extension from the common finance terms alpha and beta, and the use of sigma (the standard deviation of logarithmic returns) and tau (time to expiry) in the Black–Scholes option pricing model. Several names such as &quot;vega&quot; (whose symbol is similar to the lower-case Greek letter &quot;nu&quot;; the use of that name might have led to confusion) and &quot;zomma&quot; are invented, but sound similar to Greek letters. The names &quot;color&quot; and &quot;charm&quot; presumably derive from the use of these terms for exotic properties of quarks in particle physics.
==First-order Greeks==

===Delta===
Delta, formula_1, measures the rate of change of the theoretical option value with respect to changes in the underlying asset&#x27;s price. Delta is the first derivative of the value formula_2 of the option with respect to the underlying instrument&#x27;s price formula_3.

: formula_4

====Practical use====
For a vanilla option, delta will be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 for a long call (or a short put) and 0.0 and −1.0 for a long put (or a short call); depending on price, a call option behaves as if one owns 1 share of the underlying stock (if deep in the money), or owns nothing (if far out of the money), or something in between, and conversely for a put option. The difference between the delta of a call and the delta of a put at the same strike is equal to one. By put–call parity, long a call and short a put is equivalent to a forward &quot;F&quot;, which is linear in the spot &quot;S,&quot; with unit factor, so the derivative dF/dS is 1. See the formulas below.

These numbers are commonly presented as a percentage of the total number of shares represented by the option contract(s). This is convenient because the option will (instantaneously) behave like the number of shares indicated by the delta. For example, if a portfolio of 100 American call options on XYZ each have a delta of 0.25 (= 25%), it will gain or lose value just like 2,500 shares of XYZ as the price changes for small price movements (100 option contracts covers 10,000 shares). The sign and percentage are often dropped – the sign is implicit in the option type (negative for put, positive for call) and the percentage is understood. The most commonly quoted are 25 delta put, 50 delta put/50 delta call, and 25 delta call. 50 Delta put and 50 Delta call are not quite identical, due to spot and forward differing by the discount factor, but they are often conflated.

Delta is always positive for long calls and negative for long puts (unless they are zero). The total delta of a complex portfolio of positions on the same underlying asset can be calculated by simply taking the sum of the deltas for each individual position – delta of a portfolio is linear in the constituents. Since the delta of underlying asset is always 1.0, the trader could delta-hedge his entire position in the underlying by buying or shorting the number of shares indicated by the total delta. For example, if the delta of a portfolio of options in XYZ (expressed as shares of the underlying) is +2.75, the trader would be able to delta-hedge the portfolio by selling short 2.75 shares of the underlying. This portfolio will then retain its total value regardless of which direction the price of XYZ moves. (Albeit for only small movements of the underlying, a short amount of time and not-withstanding changes in other market conditions such as volatility and the rate of return for a risk-free investment).

====As a proxy for probability====
The (absolute value of) Delta is close to, but not identical with, the percent moneyness of an option, i.e., the &quot;implied&quot; probability that the option will expire in-the-money (if the market moves under Brownian motion in the risk-neutral measure). For this reason some option traders use the absolute value of delta as an approximation for percent moneyness. For example, if an out-of-the-money call option has a delta of 0.15, the trader might estimate that the option has approximately a 15% chance of expiring in-the-money. Similarly, if a put contract has a delta of −0.25, the trader might expect the option to have a 25% probability of expiring in-the-money. At-the-money calls and puts have a delta of approximately 0.5 and −0.5 respectively with a slight bias towards higher deltas for ATM calls since the risk-free rate introduces some offset to the delta. The negative discounted probability of an option ending up in the money at expiry is called the dual delta, which is the first derivative of option price with respect to strike.

====Relationship between call and put delta====
Given a European call and put option for the same underlying, strike price and time to maturity, and with no dividend yield, the sum of the absolute values of the delta of each option will be 1 – more precisely, the delta of the call (positive) minus the delta of the put (negative) equals 1. This is due to put–call parity: a long call plus a short put (a call minus a put) replicates a forward, which has delta equal to 1.

If the value of delta for an option is known, one can calculate the value of the delta of the option of the same strike price, underlying and maturity but opposite right by subtracting 1 from a known call delta or adding 1 to a known put delta.

: formula_5

For example, if the delta of a call is 0.42 then one can compute the delta of the corresponding put at the same strike price by 0.42 − 1 = −0.58. To derive the delta of a call from a put, one can similarly take −0.58 and add 1 to get 0.42.

===Vega===
Vega measures sensitivity to volatility. Vega is the derivative of the option value with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset.

: formula_6

&quot;Vega&quot; is not the name of any Greek letter. The glyph used is a non-standard majuscule version of the Greek letter &quot;nu&quot; (formula_7), written as formula_8. Presumably the name &quot;vega&quot; was adopted because the Greek letter &quot;nu&quot; looked like a Latin &quot;vee&quot;, and &quot;vega&quot; was derived from &quot;vee&quot; by analogy with how &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;eta&quot;, and &quot;theta&quot; are pronounced in American English.

The symbol kappa, formula_9, is sometimes used (by academics) instead of vega (as is tau (formula_10)
or capital lambda (formula_11),

though these are rare).

Vega is typically expressed as the amount of money per underlying share that the option&#x27;s value will gain or lose as volatility rises or falls by 1 percentage point. All options (both calls and puts) will gain value with rising volatility.

Vega can be an important Greek to monitor for an option trader, especially in volatile markets, since the value of some option strategies can be particularly sensitive to changes in volatility. The value of an at-the-money option straddle, for example, is extremely dependent on changes to volatility.
See Volatility risk.

===Theta===
Theta, formula_12, measures the sensitivity of the value of the derivative to the passage of time (see Option time value): the &quot;time decay.&quot;

: formula_13

As time passes, with decreasing time to expiry and all else being equal, an option&#x27;s extrinsic value decreases. Typically (but see below), this means an option loses value with time, which is conventionally referred to as long options typically having short (negative) theta. In fact, typically, the literal first derivative w.r.t. time of an option&#x27;s value is a &quot;positive&quot; number. The change in option value is typically negative because &quot;the passage of time&quot; is a negative number (a &quot;decrease&quot; to formula_14, time to expiry). However, by convention, practitioners usually prefer to refer to theta exposure (&quot;decay&quot;) of a long option as negative (instead of the passage of time as negative), and so theta is usually reported as -1 times the first derivative, as above.

While extrinsic value is decreasing with time passing, sometimes a countervailing factor is discounting. For deep-in-the-money options of some types (for puts in Black-Scholes, puts and calls in Black&#x27;s), as discount factors increase towards 1 with the passage of time, that is an element of &quot;increasing&quot; value in a long option. Sometimes deep-in-the-money options will gain more from increasing discount factors than they lose from decreasing extrinsic value, and reported theta will be a positive value for a long option instead of a more typical negative value (and the option will be an early exercise candidate, if exercisable, and a European option may become worth less than parity).

By convention in options valuation formulas, formula_14, time to expiry, is defined in years. Practitioners commonly prefer to view theta in terms of change in number of days to expiry rather than number of years to expiry. Therefore, reported theta is usually divided by number of days in a year. (Whether to count calendar days or business days varies by personal choice, with arguments for both.)

===Rho===

Rho, formula_16, measures sensitivity to the interest rate: it is the derivative of the option value with respect to the risk-free interest rate (for the relevant outstanding term).

: formula_17

Except under extreme circumstances, the value of an option is less sensitive to changes in the risk-free interest rate than to changes in other parameters. For this reason, rho is the least used of the first-order Greeks.

Rho is typically expressed as the amount of money, per share of the underlying, that the value of the option will gain or lose as the risk-free interest rate rises or falls by 1.0% per annum (100 basis points).

===Lambda===
Lambda, formula_18, omega, formula_19, or elasticity is the percentage change in option value per percentage change in the underlying price, a measure of leverage, sometimes called gearing.

: formula_20

It holds that formula_21.

It is similar to the concept of delta but expressed in percentage terms rather than absolute terms.

===Epsilon===

Epsilon, formula_22 (also known as psi, formula_23), is the percentage change in option value per percentage change in the underlying dividend yield, a measure of the dividend risk. The dividend yield impact is in practice determined using a 10% increase in those yields. Obviously, this sensitivity can only be applied to derivative instruments of equity products.

: formula_24

Numerically, all first-order sensitivities can be interpreted as spreads in expected returns. Information geometry offers another (trigonometric) interpretation.

==Second-order Greeks==
===Gamma===
Gamma, formula_25, measures the rate of change in the delta with respect to changes in the underlying price. Gamma is the second derivative of the value function with respect to the underlying price.

: formula_26

Most long options have positive gamma and most short options have negative gamma. Long options have a positive relationship with gamma because as price increases, Gamma increases as well, causing Delta to approach 1 from 0 (long call option) and 0 from −1 (long put option). The inverse is true for short options. Gamma is greatest approximately at-the-money (ATM) and diminishes the further out you go either in-the-money (ITM) or out-of-the-money (OTM). Gamma is important because it corrects for the convexity of value.

When a trader seeks to establish an effective delta-hedge for a portfolio, the trader may also seek to neutralize the portfolio&#x27;s gamma, as this will ensure that the hedge will be effective over a wider range of underlying price movements.

===Vanna===
Vanna, also referred to as DvegaDspot and DdeltaDvol, is a second-order derivative of the option value, once to the underlying spot price and once to volatility. It is mathematically equivalent to DdeltaDvol, the sensitivity of the option delta with respect to change in volatility; or alternatively, the partial of vega with respect to the underlying instrument&#x27;s price. Vanna can be a useful sensitivity to monitor when maintaining a delta- or vega-hedged portfolio as vanna will help the trader to anticipate changes to the effectiveness of a delta-hedge as volatility changes or the effectiveness of a vega-hedge against change in the underlying spot price.

If the underlying value has continuous second partial derivatives, then formula_27

===Charm===
Charm or delta decay measures the instantaneous rate of change of delta over the passage of time.

: formula_28

Charm has also been called DdeltaDtime. Charm can be an important Greek to measure/monitor when delta-hedging a position over a weekend. Charm is a second-order derivative of the option value, once to price and once to the passage of time. It is also then the derivative of theta with respect to the underlying&#x27;s price.

The mathematical result of the formula for charm (see below) is expressed in delta/year. It is often useful to divide this by the number of days per year to arrive at the delta decay per day. This use is fairly accurate when the number of days remaining until option expiration is large. When an option nears expiration, charm itself may change quickly, rendering full day estimates of delta decay inaccurate.

===Vomma===
Vomma, volga, vega convexity, or DvegaDvol measures second-order sensitivity to volatility. Vomma is the second derivative of the option value with respect to the volatility, or, stated another way, vomma measures the rate of change to vega as volatility changes.

: formula_29

With positive vomma, a position will become long vega as implied volatility increases and short vega as it decreases, which can be scalped in a way analogous to long gamma. And an initially vega-neutral, long-vomma position can be constructed from ratios of options at different strikes. Vomma is positive for long options away from the money, and initially increases with distance from the money (but drops off as vega drops off). (Specifically, vomma is positive where the usual &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;2 terms are of the same sign, which is true when &quot;d&quot;1 &lt; 0 or &quot;d&quot;2 &gt; 0.)

===Veta===
Veta, vega decay or DvegaDtime measures the rate of change in the vega with respect to the passage of time. Veta is the second derivative of the value function; once to volatility and once to time.

: formula_30

It is common practice to divide the mathematical result of veta by 100 times the number of days per year to reduce the value to the percentage change in vega per one day.

===Vera===
Vera (sometimes rhova) measures the rate of change in rho with respect to volatility. Vera is the second derivative of the value function; once to volatility and once to interest rate.

: formula_31

The word &#x27;Vera&#x27; was coined by R. Naryshkin in early 2012 when this sensitivity needed to be used in practice to assess the impact of volatility changes on rho-hedging, but no name yet existed in the available literature. &#x27;Vera&#x27; was picked to sound similar to a combination of Vega and Rho, its respective first-order Greeks. This name is now in a wider use, including, for example, the Maple computer algebra software (which has &#x27;BlackScholesVera&#x27; function in its Finance package).

===Second-order partial derivative with respect to strike &quot;K&quot;===

This partial derivative has a fundamental role in the Breeden–Litzenberger formula, which uses quoted call option prices to estimate the risk-neutral probabilities implied by such prices.

: formula_32

For call options, it can be approximated using infinitesimal portfolios of butterfly strategies.

==Third-order Greeks==

===Speed===
Speed measures the rate of change in Gamma with respect to changes in the underlying price.

: formula_33

This is also sometimes referred to as the gamma of the gamma or DgammaDspot. Speed is the third derivative of the value function with respect to the underlying spot price. Speed can be important to monitor when delta-hedging or gamma-hedging a portfolio.

===Zomma===
Zomma measures the rate of change of gamma with respect to changes in volatility.

: formula_34

Zomma has also been referred to as DgammaDvol. Zomma is the third derivative of the option value, twice to underlying asset price and once to volatility. Zomma can be a useful sensitivity to monitor when maintaining a gamma-hedged portfolio as zomma will help the trader to anticipate changes to the effectiveness of the hedge as volatility changes.

===Color===
Color, gamma decay or DgammaDtime measures the rate of change of gamma over the passage of time.

: formula_35

Color is a third-order derivative of the option value, twice to underlying asset price and once to time. Color can be an important sensitivity to monitor when maintaining a gamma-hedged portfolio as it can help the trader to anticipate the effectiveness of the hedge as time passes.

The mathematical result of the formula for color (see below) is expressed in gamma per year. It is often useful to divide this by the number of days per year to arrive at the change in gamma per day. This use is fairly accurate when the number of days remaining until option expiration is large. When an option nears expiration, color itself may change quickly, rendering full day estimates of gamma change inaccurate.

=== Ultima ===
Ultima measures the sensitivity of the option vomma with respect to change in volatility. 
: formula_36

Ultima has also been referred to as DvommaDvol. Ultima is a third-order derivative of the option value to volatility.

=== Parmicharma ===
Parmicharma measures the rate of change of charm over the passage of time. 
: formula_37

Parmicharma has also been referred to as DcharmDtime. Parmicharma is a third-order derivative of the option value, twice to time and once to underlying asset price. In order to better maintain a delta-hedge portfolio as time passes, the trader may hedge charm in addition to their current delta position. Parmicharma can be a useful sensitivity to monitor when maintaining such a charm-hedged portfolio as parmicharma will help the trader anticipate changes to the effectiveness of the hedge as time passes.

==Greeks for multi-asset options==
If the value of a derivative is dependent on two or more underlyings, its Greeks are extended to include the cross-effects between the underlyings.

Correlation delta measures the sensitivity of the derivative&#x27;s value to a change in the correlation between the underlyings. It is also commonly known as cega.

Cross gamma measures the rate of change of delta in one underlying to a change in the level of another underlying.

Cross vanna measures the rate of change of vega in one underlying due to a change in the level of another underlying. Equivalently, it measures the rate of change of delta in the second underlying due to a change in the volatility of the first underlying.

Cross volga measures the rate of change of vega in one underlying to a change in the volatility of another underlying.

==Formulae for European option Greeks==
The Greeks of European options (calls and puts) under the Black–Scholes model are calculated as follows, where formula_38 (phi) is the standard normal probability density function and formula_39 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Note that the gamma and vega formulas are the same for calls and puts.

For a given:
* Stock price formula_40,
* Strike price formula_41,
* Risk-free rate formula_42,
* Annual dividend yield formula_43,
* Time to maturity formula_44 (represented as a unit-less fraction of one year), and
* Volatility formula_45.

==Related measures==
Some related risk measures of financial instruments are listed below.

===Bond duration and convexity===

In trading bonds and other fixed income securities, various measures of bond duration are used analogously to the delta of an option. The closest analogue to the delta is DV01, which is the reduction in price (in currency units) for an increase of one basis point (i.e. 0.01% per annum) in the yield, where yield is the underlying variable;
see .
(Related is CS01, measuring sensitivity to credit spread.)

Analogous to the lambda is the modified duration, which is the &quot;percentage&quot; change in the market price of the bond(s) for a &quot;unit&quot; change in the yield (i.e. it is equivalent to DV01 divided by the market price). Unlike the lambda, which is an elasticity (a percentage change in output for a percentage change in input), the modified duration is instead a &quot;semi&quot;-elasticity—a percentage change in output for a &quot;unit&quot; change in input.
See also Key rate duration.

Bond convexity is a measure of the sensitivity of the duration to changes in interest rates, the second derivative of the price of the bond with respect to interest rates (duration is the first derivative); it is then analogous to gamma. In general, the higher the convexity, the more sensitive the bond price is to the change in interest rates. Bond convexity is one of the most basic and widely used forms of convexity in finance.

For a bond with an embedded option, the standard yield to maturity based calculations here do not consider how changes in interest rates will alter the cash flows due to option exercise. To address this, effective duration and effective convexity are introduced. These values are typically calculated using a tree-based model, built for the entire yield curve (as opposed to a single yield to maturity), and therefore capturing exercise behavior at each point in the option&#x27;s life as a function of both time and interest rates; see .

===Beta===

The beta (β) of a stock or portfolio is a number describing the volatility of an asset in relation to the volatility of the benchmark that said asset is being compared to. This benchmark is generally the overall financial market and is often estimated via the use of representative indices, such as the S&amp;P 500.

An asset has a Beta of zero if its returns change independently of changes in the market&#x27;s returns. A positive beta means that the asset&#x27;s returns generally follow the market&#x27;s returns, in the sense that they both tend to be above their respective averages together, or both tend to be below their respective averages together. A negative beta means that the asset&#x27;s returns generally move opposite the market&#x27;s returns: one will tend to be above its average when the other is below its average.

===Fugit===

The fugit is the expected time to exercise an American or Bermudan option. Fugit is usefully computed for hedging purposes — for example, one can represent flows of an American swaption like the flows of a swap starting at the fugit multiplied by delta, and then use these to compute other sensitivities.

<text>A runabout is any small motorboat holding between four and eight people, well suited to moving about on the water. Characteristically between 20&#x27; and 35&#x27; in length, runabouts are used for pleasure activities like boating, fishing, and water skiing, as a ship&#x27;s tender for larger vessels, or in racing. Some common runabout types are bow rider, center console, cuddy boat and walkaround. The world&#x27;s largest runabout, &quot;Pardon Me&quot;, is 48 feet long and owned by the Antique Boat Museum in Clayton, New York.

== History ==
The first runabouts date back to the 1920s and were originally small, fast, powerful, varnished, wooden boats created to take advantage of the power of outboard motors such as the first Evinrude, introduced in 1909.

In order to gain speed, the hull shape had to be designed to take advantage of hydroplaning; a hydrofoil-like design would allow the boat to skim atop the water&#x27;s surface at high speed instead of needing to push aside large quantities of water to move forward. Another design change which followed soon after was the replacement of the tiller and rudder control with a rudder controlled by a steering wheel, allowing the operator a comfortable forward-facing position. A remote lever to allow the engines to be placed into a reverse gear was another early innovation.

Among the leading builders of 1920s runabouts was John L. Hacker, who founded the Hacker Boat Company in 1908. Hacker was a pioneering naval architect who developed many design innovations, like the &#x27;V-bottom&#x27;. His designs became the model upon which virtually all subsequent runabouts were based.

Shortly, similar upscale varnished-wood runabouts by Gar Wood and Chris-Craft and were also available, fitted with windshields to protect the cockpits and up to Liberty V-12 marinized surplus World War I aero engines built for speed.

But by the late 1940s, Gar Wood had stopped producing boats, and by the 1960s Chris-Craft was moving to the more modern materials of plastic and fiberglass. Hackercraft, with multiple changes in ownership, continued on.

The mahogany runabouts built by Italian builder Carlo Riva in the late 1950s and the 1960s are considered by many to be premier European examples of the type. The most famous Riva of all time was the Carlo Riva design called the Aquarama Special.

== Construction and materials ==
Originally, runabouts were made entirely of wood, with mahogany used for hulls and planking and oak for framing. The use of aluminium in small boat construction came soon after World War II because of availability of aircraft materials as war surplus. Fiberglass was then introduced as another way to reduce the maintenance, cost and weight of watercraft. Given the cost benefits and personal enjoyment of boat building, do-it-yourself ′Kit Boats′ were also introduced using plywood material. In 1955, Chris-Craft created The Plywood Boat Division which marketed both Kit and pre-built plywood craft.

By 1960, wooden powerboats had become rare since most new vessels used fiberglass or other lightweight materials, including fiber reinforced plastic materials to reduce weight and maximize speed, particularly in racing craft. The art of boatbuilding in wood has been largely lost since it requires a level of craftsmanship impossible in large scale production boat building. One exception is the Hacker Boat Company, which continues to produce mahogany boats on the shores of Lake George, New York. Other wooden boatbuilders include Graf, J-Craft, and Boesch.

== Propulsion ==
Runabouts can be powered by inboard engines, outboards, jet drives, or inboard-outboard (I/O) drives. Engines can be gasoline or diesel systems.

Inboards have the engine block permanently mounted within the hull of the boat, with a drive shaft and a propeller to drive the craft underneath the hull, and a separate rudder to steer the craft.

Outboards are steerable external drive motors containing the engine block, linkage gears, and propeller within a single unit, taking the place of a rudder. Outboard drives are mounted to the transom and steered by a remote system leading to a wheel mounted on the boat&#x27;s console.

Inboard-Outboard (or stern drives) are a hybrid, with an engine block mounted within the hull linked to a pivotable lower drive unit which steers the craft, similar to an outboard motor.

Jet Drives have a propeller enclosed in a pump-jet that draws water from underneath the hull and expels it through a swiveling nozzle in the stern. They are highly maneuverable and tolerant of shallow water, but need larger engines and use more fuel than the other alternatives.
