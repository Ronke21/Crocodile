<text>The Lewis gun (or Lewis automatic machine gun or Lewis automatic rifle) is a First World War–era light machine gun. Designed privately in the United States though not adopted there, the design was finalised and mass-produced in the United Kingdom, and widely used by troops of the British Empire during the war. It had a distinctive barrel cooling shroud (containing a finned breech-to-muzzle aluminium heat sink to cool the gun barrel), and top-mounted pan magazine. The Lewis served until the end of the Korean War, and was widely used as an aircraft machine gun during both World Wars, almost always with the cooling shroud removed, as air flow during flight offered sufficient cooling.

== History ==

A predecessor to the Lewis gun incorporating the principles upon which it was based was designed by Ferdinand Mannlicher. The Lewis gun was invented by U.S. Army colonel Isaac Newton Lewis in 1911, based on initial work by Samuel Maclean. Despite its origins, the Lewis gun was not initially adopted by the U.S. military, most likely because of political differences between Lewis and General William Crozier, the chief of the Ordnance Department. Lewis became frustrated with trying to persuade the U.S. Army to adopt his design, claiming that he was &quot;slapped by rejections from ignorant hacks&quot;, and retired from the army.

Lewis left the United States in 1913 and went to Belgium, where he established the Armes Automatique Lewis company in Liège to facilitate commercial production of the gun. Lewis had been working closely with British arms manufacturer the Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA) in an effort to overcome some of the production difficulties of the weapon. The Belgians bought a small number of Lewis guns in 1913, using the .303 British round and, in 1914, BSA purchased a licence to manufacture the Lewis machine gun in England, which resulted in Lewis receiving significant royalty payments and becoming very wealthy.
Lewis and his factory moved to England before 1914, away from possible seizure in the event of a German invasion.

== Production ==
The onset of the First World War increased demand for the Lewis gun, and BSA began production, under the designation &quot;Model 1914&quot;. The design was officially approved for service on 15 October 1915 under the designation &quot;Gun, Lewis, .303-cal.&quot; No Lewis guns were produced in Belgium during the war. all manufacture was carried out by BSA in England and the Savage Arms Company in the US, and although the two versions were largely similar, enough differences existed to stop them being completely interchangeable, although this had been rectified by the time of the Second World War.

The major difference between the two designs was that the BSA weapons were chambered for .303 British ammunition, whereas the Savage guns were chambered for .30-06 cartridges, which necessitated some difference in the magazine, feed mechanism, bolt, barrel, extractors, and gas operation system. Savage did make Lewis guns in .303 British calibre, though. The Model 1916 and Model 1917 were exported to Canada and the United Kingdom, and a few were supplied to the US military, particularly the Navy. The Savage Model 1917 was generally produced in .30-06 calibre. A number of these guns were supplied to the UK under lend-lease during the Second World War.

== Design details ==
The Lewis gun was gas operated. A portion of the expanding propellant gas was tapped off from the barrel, driving a piston to the rear against a spring. The piston was fitted with a vertical post at its rear which rode in a helical cam track in the bolt, rotating it at the end of its travel nearest the breech. This allowed the three locking lugs at the rear of the bolt to engage in recesses in the gun&#x27;s body to lock it into place. The post also carried a fixed firing pin, which protruded through an aperture in the front of the bolt, firing the next round at the foremost part of the piston&#x27;s travel.
The gun&#x27;s aluminium barrel-shroud caused the muzzle blast to draw air over the barrel and cool it, due to the muzzle-to-breech, radially finned aluminium heat sink within the shroud&#x27;s barrel, and protruding behind the shroud&#x27;s aft end, running lengthwise in contact with the gun barrel (somewhat like the later American M1917/18 Marlin-Rockwell machine gun&#x27;s similar gun barrel cooling design) from the &quot;bottleneck&quot; near the shroud&#x27;s muzzle end and protruding externally behind the shroud&#x27;s rear end. Some discussion occurred over whether the shroud was necessary: in the Second World War, many old aircraft guns that did not have the tubing were issued to anti-aircraft units of the British Home Guard and to British airfields, and others were used on vehicle mounts in the Western Desert; all were found to function properly without it, which led to the suggestion that Lewis had insisted on the cooling arrangement largely to show that his design was different from Maclean&#x27;s earlier prototypes. Only the Royal Navy retained the tube/heatsink cooling system on their deck-mounted AA-configuration Lewis guns.

The Lewis gun used a pan magazine holding 47 or 97 rounds. Pan magazines hold the ammunition nose-inwards toward the center, in a radial fan. Unlike the more common drum magazines, which hold the rounds parallel to the axis and are fed by spring tension, pan magazines are mechanically indexed. The Lewis magazine was driven by a cam on top of the bolt which operated a pawl mechanism via a lever.

An interesting point of the design was that it did not use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing just in front of the trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. The Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.

The gun&#x27;s cyclic rate of fire was about 500–600 rounds per minute. A recoil enhancer was added to the 1918 aircraft gun variant (and refitted to many 1917 models) which increased the rate of fire to about 800 rounds per minute. The ground use versions weighed 28 lb (12.7 kg), only about half as much as a typical medium machine gun of the era, such as the Vickers machine gun, and was chosen in part because, being more portable than a heavy machine gun, it could be carried and used by one soldier. BSA even produced at least one model (the &quot;B.S.A. Light Infantry Pattern Lewis Gun&quot;, which lacked the aluminium barrel shroud and had a wooden fore grip) designed as a form of automatic rifle.

== Service ==

=== First World War ===

During the first days of the war, the Belgian Army had put in service 20 prototypes (5 in 7.65×53mm and 15 in .303) for the defense of Namur.

The United Kingdom officially adopted the Lewis gun in .303 British calibre for land and aircraft use in October 1915. The weapon began to be issued to the British Army&#x27;s infantry battalions on the Western Front in early 1916 as a replacement for the heavier and less mobile Vickers machine gun, which had been withdrawn from the infantry for use by the specialist Machine Gun Corps. The US Navy and Marine Corps followed in early 1917, adopting the M1917 Lewis gun (produced by the Savage Arms Co.), in .30-06 calibre.

Notes made during his training in 1918 by Arthur Bullock, a private soldier in the 2/4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, record that the chief advantage of the gun was &#x27;its invulnerability&#x27; and its chief disadvantages were &#x27;its delicacy, the fact that it is useless for setting up a barrage, and also that the system of air cooling employed does not allow of more than 12 magazines being fired continuously&#x27;. He records its weight as 26 lbs unloaded and lbs loaded (though later he mentions that it weighed 35 lbs loaded), and that it had 47 cartridges in a fully loaded magazine; also that it was supported by a bipod in front and by the operator&#x27;s shoulder at the rear. About six months into his service, Bullock was sent on Lewis gun refresher course at La Lacque, and he recalled that the rigour of the training meant that &#x27;everyone passed out 100 percent efficient, the meaning of which will be appreciated when I say that part of the final test was to strip down the gun completely and then, blindfolded, put those 104 parts together again correctly in just one minute.&#x27;

The gun was operated by a team of seven. Bullock was the First Lewis Gunner who carried the gun and a revolver, while &#x27;The Second Gunner carried a bag containing spare parts, and the remaining five members of the team carried loaded pans of ammunition&#x27;. Bullock noted, &#x27;all could fire the gun if required, and all could effect repairs in seconds&#x27;. Bullock provides several vivid descriptions of the gun&#x27;s use in combat. For example, on 13 April 1918 he and his fellow soldiers intercepted a German advance along the Calonne/Robecq road, noting &#x27;we fired the gun in turns until it was too hot to hold&#x27; and recording that 400 German casualties were caused, &#x27;chiefly by my Lewis gun!&#x27;.

The US Army never officially adopted the weapon for infantry use and even went so far as to take Lewis guns away from US Marines arriving in France and replace them with the Chauchat LMG—a practice believed to be related to General Crozier&#x27;s dislike of Lewis and his gun. The divisions of the US II Corps attached to the British Army were equipped with the gun. The US Army eventually adopted the Browning Automatic Rifle in 1917 (although it was September 1918 before any of the new guns reached the front). The US Navy and Marine Corps continued to use the .30-06 calibre Lewis until the early part of the Second World War.
The Russian Empire purchased 10,000 Lewis guns in 1917 from the British government, and ordered another 10,000 weapons from Savage Arms in the US. The US government was unwilling to supply the Tsarist Russian government with the guns and some doubt exists as to whether they were actually delivered, although records indicate that 5,982 Savage weapons were delivered to Russia by 31 March 1917. The Lewis guns supplied by Britain were dispatched to Russia in May 1917, but it is not known for certain whether these were the Savage-made weapons being trans-shipped through the UK, or a separate batch of UK-produced units. White armies in Northwest Russia received several hundred Lewis guns in 1918–1919.

British Mark IV tanks used the Lewis, replacing the Vickers and Hotchkiss used in earlier tanks. The Lewis was chosen for its relatively compact magazines, but the ventilation system inside the tank caused the airflow to be reversed through the Lewis cooling jacket, resulting in hot air and fumes being blown into the gunner&#x27;s face. As soon as an improved belt feed for the Hotchkiss was developed, the Lewis was replaced by them in later tank models.

As their enemies used the mobility of the gun to ambush German raiding parties, the Germans nicknamed the Lewis &quot;the Belgian Rattlesnake&quot;. They used captured Lewis guns in both World Wars, and included instruction in its operation and care as part of their machine-gun crew training.

Despite costing more than a Vickers gun to manufacture (the cost of a Lewis gun was £165 in 1915 and £175 in 1918; the Vickers cost about £100), Lewis machine guns were in high demand with the British military during the First World War. The Lewis also had the advantage of being about 80% faster to build than the Vickers, and was a lot more portable. Accordingly, the British government placed orders for 3,052 guns between August 1914 and June 1915. Lewis guns outnumbered the Vickers by a ratio of about 3:1.

==== Aircraft use ====


The Lewis gun was the first machine gun fired from an aeroplane; on 7 June 1912, Captain Charles Chandler of the US Army fired a prototype Lewis gun from the foot-bar of a Wright Model B Flyer.

Lewis guns were used extensively on British and French aircraft during the First World War, as either an observer&#x27;s or gunner&#x27;s weapon or an additional weapon to the more common Vickers. The Lewis&#x27;s popularity as an aircraft machine gun was partly due to its low weight, the fact that it was air-cooled and that it used self-contained 97-round drum magazines. Because of this, the Lewis was first mounted on the Vickers F.B.5 &quot;Gunbus&quot;, which was probably the world&#x27;s first purpose-built combat aircraft when it entered service in August 1914, replacing the Vickers machine gun used on earlier experimental versions. It was also fitted on two early production examples of the Bristol Scout C aircraft by Lanoe Hawker in mid-1915, mounted on the port side and firing forwards and outwards at a 30° angle to avoid the propeller arc.

The problem in mounting a Lewis to fire forward in most single-engined tractor configuration fighters was due to the open bolt firing cycle of the Lewis, which prevented it from being synchronized to fire directly forward through the propeller arc of such aircraft; only the unusual French SPAD S.A &quot;pulpit plane&quot; which possessed a unique hinged gunner&#x27;s nacelle immediately ahead of the propeller (and the pilot), and the British pusher fighters Vickers F.B.5, Airco D.H.2, Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 and F.E.8 could readily use the Lewis as direct forward-firing armament early in the war. Some British single-engined tractor configuration fighters used a Foster mounting on the top wing to elevate a Lewis gun above the propeller arc for unsynchronized firing, including production S.E.5/S.E.5a fighters and field-modified examples of the Avro 504. For the use of observers or rear gunners, the Lewis was mounted on a Scarff ring, which allowed the gun to be rotated and elevated whilst supporting the gun&#x27;s weight.

Until September 1916 Zeppelin airships were very difficult to attack successfully at high altitude, although this also made accurate bombing impossible. Aeroplanes struggled to reach a typical altitude of , and firing the solid bullets usually used by aircraft Lewis guns was ineffectual: they made small holes causing inconsequential gas leaks. Britain developed new bullets, the Brock containing spontaneously igniting potassium chlorate, and the Buckingham filled with pyrophoric phosphorus, to set fire to the Zeppelin&#x27;s hydrogen. These had become available by September 1916. When combined with explosive Pomeroy bullets which ripped open the envelopes, they proved very successful, and Lewis guns loaded with a mixture of Pomeroy, Brock and Buckingham ammunition were often employed for balloon-busting against German Zeppelins, other airships and &quot;Drache&quot; barrage balloons.
On the French Nieuport 11 and later Nieuport 17 sesquiplanes, a Lewis gun was mounted above the top wing (in a similar way as fitted to the British S.E.5a) – sometimes on a Foster mount, which allowed firing directly forward outside the propeller arc. The Foster mount usually incorporated an arc-shaped I-beam rail as its rearmost structural member, that a Lewis gun could be slid backwards and downwards along the rail towards the cockpit, to allow the ammunition drum to be changed in flight – but RFC fighter ace Albert Ball VC also understood that the Lewis gun in such a mount also retained its original trigger, and could thus be fired upwards. He used the upward firing Lewis to attack solitary German two-seater aircraft from below and behind, where the observer could not see him or fire back. It was his use of the weapon in this way, in a Nieuport, that led to its later introduction on the S.E.5/S.E.5a: Ball had acted in a consultant capacity on the development of this aeroplane. The later Sopwith Dolphin, already armed with twin synchronized Vickers guns just forward of the pilot and just above its V-8 engine, could also use one or two Lewis guns mounted on the forward crossbar of its cabane structure, between the top wing panels, as an anti-Zeppelin measure. A few of the Dolphins in use with No. 87 Squadron RAF in the summer of 1918, alternatively mounted their twin Lewises atop the lower wings just inboard of the inner wing struts for an additional pair of forward-firing machine guns; in such a field-achieved configuration, however, neither gun-jam clearing, nor drum magazine replacement were possible on their Lewises during a mission.

Lewis guns were also carried as defensive guns on British airships. The SS class blimps carried one gun. The larger NS class blimps carried two or three guns in the control car and some were fitted with an additional gun and a gunner&#x27;s position at the top of the gasbag.

=== Second World War ===
By the Second World War, the British Army had replaced the Lewis gun with the Bren gun for most infantry use. As an airborne weapon, the Lewis was largely supplanted by the Vickers K, a weapon that could achieve over twice the rate of fire of the Lewis.

In the crisis following the Fall of France, where a large part of the British Army&#x27;s equipment had been lost up to and at Dunkirk, stocks of Lewis guns in both .303 and .30-06 were hurriedly pressed back into service, primarily for Home Guard, airfield defence and anti-aircraft use. 58,983 Lewis guns were taken from stores, repaired, refitted and issued by the British during the course of the war. In addition to their reserve weapon role in the UK, they also saw front-line use with the Dutch, British, Australian, and New Zealand forces in the early years of the Pacific campaign against the Japanese. The Lewis gun saw continued service as an anti-aircraft weapon during the war; in this role, it was credited by the British for bringing down more low-flying enemy aircraft than any other AA weapon. Peter White indicates that his battalion of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers was still using the Lewis on Universal Carriers in 1945. Royal Naval Commandos were also designated use of the weapon for their beach parties.

At the start of the Second World War, the Lewis was the Royal Navy&#x27;s standard close-range air defence weapon. It was installed on major warships, armed trawlers and defensively equipped merchant ships. It was often used in twin mountings and a quadruple mount was developed for motor torpedo boats. British submarines generally carried two guns on single mounts. Although it was gradually replaced by the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, new corvettes were still being fitted with twin Lewises as late as 1942. Lewis guns were also carried by the Royal Air Force&#x27;s air-sea rescue launches.
American forces used the Lewis gun (in .30-06 calibre) throughout the war. The US Navy used the weapon on armed merchant cruisers, small auxiliary ships, landing craft and submarines. The US Coast Guard also used the Lewis on their vessels. It was never officially adopted by the US Army for anything other than aircraft use.

The Germans used captured British Lewis guns during the war under the designation MG 137(e), whilst the Japanese copied the Lewis design and employed it extensively during the war; it was designated the Type 92 and chambered for a 7.7 mm rimmed cartridge that was interchangeable with the .303 British round.

The Lewis was officially withdrawn from British service in 1946, but continued to be used by forces operating against the United Nations in the Korean War. It was also used against French and US forces in the First Indochina War and the subsequent Vietnam War.

Total production of the Lewis gun during the Second World War by BSA was over 145,000 units, a total of 3,550 guns were produced by the Savage Arms Co. for US service: 2,500 in .30-06 and 1,050 in .303 British calibre.

== Variants ==
=== Canada ===
* Model 1915. This was the designation given to .303 Lewis Mk I weapons manufactured for Canada in the United States by the Savage Arms Company. Large numbers of these guns were also produced by Savage for the British Army and in an aircraft configuration, for France and Italy.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
* Vz 28/L. 731 7.92×57mm Lewis guns formerly used by the Czechoslovakian infantry were modified to aircraft (or anti-aircraft) machine guns by Česká zbrojovka Strakonice.

=== Netherlands ===
* Mitrailleur M. 20. In the Netherlands, the Lewis in both ground and aircraft versions was used in 6.5×53 mm R calibre, using a 97-round magazine only. The infantry version was equipped with a carrying handle on a clamp around the rear of the cooling tube. After the German invasion of May 1940, the weapon was also used by Germany under the designation &quot;6,5 mm leichtes Maschinengewehr 100 (h)&quot;. This Dutch modification of the older BSA redesign would have been extremely simple, as the Dutch/Romanian 6.5mm Mannlicher round has very nearly the same critical dimensions of the case head and rim as .303&quot; British.

=== United Kingdom ===

* Mark I. The .303 Lewis Mk I was the basic ground pattern model used by British and British Empire forces from 1915 with few improvements.
* Mark II. This was the first purpose built aircraft version of the Lewis, earlier versions had been improvised from Mk I guns. The cooling fins were omitted to save weight, but a light protective shroud around the barrel was retained. The wooden stock was removed and replaced with a &quot;spade&quot; grip, which resembled the handle of a garden spade. A 97-round drum magazine was introduced which required a larger magazine spigot on the body of the gun.
* Mark II*. An improved Mk II with an increased rate of fire introduced in 1918.
* Mark III. A further upgrade of the Mk II with an even faster rate of fire and the barrel shroud removed, introduced later in 1918.
* Mark III*. The British designation for the US .30-06 M1918 aircraft gun, some 46,000 of which were imported for the use of the Home Guard in 1940. These guns were modified for ground use by the replacement of the spade grip with a crude skeleton stock and the addition of a simple wooden fore-stock which would allow the gun to be fired while resting on a sandbag, or from the hip while advancing.
* Mark III**. The designation for the .303 Mark III modified in the same way as the US M1918s.
* Mark III DEMS. Intended for Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships (DEMS), it was similar to the Mk III** but with the addition of a pistol grip on the fore-stock, so that the weapon could be fired free-standing from the shoulder, from any part of a ship&#x27;s decks.
* Mark IV. After all the usable weapons had been reconditioned and issued, there remained a large number of incomplete Lewis guns and spare parts. These were assembled into guns similar to the Mk III**. There was a particular shortage of the fragile &quot;clock&quot; springs for the Lewis, so a simpler spring was manufactured and housed in a straight tube which extended into the skeleton stock. Many of these guns were fitted with a simple and light tripod which had been specially produced.

=== United States ===
* M1917 Lewis. Savage produced a version of the Lewis Mk I for US forces, rechambered for the .30-06 round and with a modified gas operation due to the greater power of the US ammunition. A few of these were modified for aircraft use, when intended for non-synchronized emplacements on an airframe. The US Navy designation was Lewis Mark VI and Mk VI Mod 1.
* M1918 Lewis. A purpose built aircraft version of the M1917.

=== Experimental projects ===
A commercial venture in 1921 by the Birmingham Small Arms Company was a version which fired the 12.7×81mm (0.5-inch Vickers) ammunition, intended for use against aircraft and tanks. At around the same time, BSA developed the Light Infantry Model which had a 22-round magazine and a wooden fore-stock in place of the radiator fins and shroud; it was intended to be used in a similar way to the Browning Automatic Rifle. Another development was a twin Lewis for aircraft use in which the bodies of the two weapons were joined side-by-side and the drum magazines were mounted vertically, one on each side. None of these projects was accepted by any armed forces.

Lewis had also experimented with lighter, 30-06 calibre, box magazine-fed infantry rifle variants intended for shoulder or hip fire as a competition to the BAR. They were dubbed &quot;Assault Phase Rifle&quot; – what could be understood as the first use of the term &quot;Assault Rifle&quot;, despite the weapon being, by today&#x27;s designation, a battle rifle. Despite being three pounds lighter than it and loaded with very forward-thinking features for the time (such as an ambidexterous magazine release), the U.S. Army still chose to adopt the BAR.

A short-barrelled light machine gun variant was developed at the start of the Second World War. It came with a hand guard and was fed from a 30-round Bren magazines; however, it was decided by the British authorities to concentrate production on the Bren, which had the advantage of a changeable barrel.

== Influence on later designs ==
* The German FG 42 paratrooper&#x27;s rifle used the Lewis gun&#x27;s gas assembly and bolt design which were in turn incorporated into the M60 machine gun.
* The Type 92 machine gun, the standard hand-held machine gun used by Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft gunners in WWII, was essentially a copy of the Lewis gun.
* The Russian PKP Pecheneg machine gun uses a streamlined version of the Lewis gun&#x27;s forced air cooling in a fixed heavy barrel. This enables the Pecheneg to fire more than 600 rounds through the barrel without warping.

<text>Hans Fritz Scholl (; 22 September 1918 – 22 February 1943) was, along with Alexander Schmorell, one of the two founding members of the White Rose resistance movement in Nazi Germany. The principal author of the resistance movement&#x27;s literature, he was found guilty of high treason for distributing anti-Nazi material and was executed by the Nazi regime in 1943 during World War II.

==Early life==
Scholl was born in Ingersheim (now a part of Crailsheim, Baden-Württemberg) on 22 September 1918 to Robert and Magdalena Scholl. His father later became the mayor of Forchtenberg am Kocher. He was the second eldest of six children. His siblings were: Inge Aicher-Scholl (1917–1998); Elisabeth Scholl Hartnagel (1920–2020), who married Sophie&#x27;s long-term boyfriend, Fritz Hartnagel; Sophie Scholl (1921–1943); Werner Scholl (1922–1944), who served as a &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; medical officer and went missing in action on the Eastern Front and presumed dead in June 1944; and Thilde Scholl (1925–1926).

Scholl was raised as a Lutheran, although he did at one point consider converting to Catholicism. Against the declared will of his father, he became an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth on April 15, 1933, and initially held leadership positions in the &quot;Deutsches Jungvolk&quot;, but quickly became disillusioned with the group when he realised its true principles. In 1935, he was one of three standard-bearers from Ulm who took part in the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;Reich Party Rally for Freedom&quot; from September 10 to 16 in Nuremberg. During this time, his attitude towards the Nazi regime gradually began to change. One reason was that the fanaticism promoted in the Hitler Youth and the unconditional subordination to the power structures ruling there became more and more repugnant.

== 1937–1938 trial ==
Scholl was arrested in 1937–38 because of his membership in a forbidden Youth Movement organisation. Hans Scholl had joined the Deutsche Jungenschaft vom 1.11.1929 (d.j.1.11) in 1934, when he and other Hitler Youth members in Ulm considered membership in this group and the Hitler Youth to be compatible.

During the trial, Scholl was also charged under Paragraph 175, the paragraph in the German Criminal Code that criminalized homosexual behavior. Under questioning, he admitted to having had two separate sexual relationships, one with Rolf Futterknecht, and one with Ernest Reden, who had also made advances on his brother Werner. Futterknecht had been the one to inform on Hans.

Scholl made a positive impact on the judge, who dismissed the choice to join the youth groups as the &quot;youthful exuberance&quot; and &quot;obstinate personality&quot; of a &quot;headstrong young man.&quot; The judge then dismissed the homosexual allegations as a &quot;youthful failing.&quot; Hans was allowed to leave the trial with a clean slate. Ernest Reden, on the other hand, was sentenced to three months prison and three months in a Nazi concentration camp for the relationship.

After Scholl&#x27;s trial, no one spoke of the allegations against him. The only people who knew were his parents and his older sister, Inge, who never spoke about the charges.

== Medical studies and Wehrmacht ==
In spring of 1937, he joined the Reich Labour Service, having volunteered for duty. He was discharged in March 1939 to attend medical school at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. At the university he came into contact with professors, teachers, and students who represented positions that were clearly Christian-ethical and critical of the regime. Therefore, Hans began to question his own ideological position more critically.

During the semester break, he was drafted as a medic for front service and took the rank of medical sergeant in the French campaign. What he experienced during direct frontline operations reinforced his personal stance against the rulers and the war in particular. Hans was again enrolled in the military service in the spring of 1941 as a medic in the Wehrmacht.

== Origins of the White Rose ==
Between 1940 and 1941, Scholl, a former member of the Hitler Youth, began questioning the principles and policies of the Nazi regime. As a student at the University of Munich, Scholl met two Roman Catholic men of letters who redirected his life, inspiring him to turn from studying medicine and pursue religion, philosophy, and the arts. Through Schmorell, Scholl met medical student Traute Lafrenz in 1941. Scholl and Lafrenz soon became close friends, and for a time (summer 1941) they were lovers.

After their experiences at the Eastern Front, having learned about mass murder in Poland and the Soviet Union, Scholl and Alexander Schmorell felt compelled to take action. From the end of June until mid-July 1942, they wrote the first four leaflets. Quoting extensively from the Bible, Aristotle and Novalis, as well as Goethe and Schiller, the German poets, they appealed to what they considered the German intelligentsia, believing that these people would be easily convinced by the same arguments that also motivated the authors themselves. These leaflets were left in telephone books in public phone booths, mailed to professors and students, and taken by courier to other universities for distribution.

From 23 July to 30 October 1942, Willi Graf, Scholl and Schmorell served again at the Soviet front, and activities ceased until their return. After their return, Willi Graf became one of the core members of the White Rose. Sophie was the second to last member to join. By the end of December 1942, Kurt Huber became the last main member of the White Rose.

With six core members, two more White Rose pamphlets were created and circulated over the summer of 1942.

The leaflets were distributed around the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where many of the group members studied. Leaflets were distributed at the University of Hamburg and in the city of Ulm as well. Additionally, leaflets were also mailed to doctors, scholars, and pub owners throughout Germany.

==Capture and execution==
On 18 February 1943, while Hans and Sophie were distributing leaflets at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university maintenance man, Jakob Schmid. Schmid reported the offense and the Scholls were arrested by the Gestapo. Along with Christoph Probst, the two siblings were tried for treason by Judge Roland Freisler. They were found guilty and condemned to death on 22 February.

During his interrogation, Hans tried to protect his sister by claiming to have thrown the leaflets himself, but his testimony was contradicted by the custodian&#x27;s. He further tried to hide the role played by other members of the White Rose. Hans was well aware of the likely consequence of his actions. 
At the trial, Hans, Sophie, and Christoph Probst were sentenced to death. They were originally scheduled to be hanged in public (work had already begun on the scaffolds) but the officials feared they would be immortalized as martyrs if they were killed in public. As such, a last minute decision was made to switch the execution method to the guillotine.

After the trial, Hans, Sophie and Probst were brought to Stadelheim Prison. While there, they were told that they would be executed the same day. This came as a shock to them, as prisoners were supposed to have at least a 99-day respite before execution. Left in separate cells, they began to write their last letters.

While in their cells, Hans, Sophie, and Probst each saw a priest to give them the last rites of the Catholic Church. Christoph Probst, who was not part of any denomination, asked to be baptized into the Catholic Church. Hans and Sophie each also asked individually to be allowed into the Catholic Church, but their Lutheran priest advised against it, on the basis that it would upset their mother, who was a devout Lutheran.

At around 4-5 pm, Robert and Magdalena Scholl, the parents of Sophie and Hans, went to the prison and demanded to see their children. To their surprise, the request was granted. Robert and Magdalena were led to a room. In a few minutes Hans entered. Dressed in prison uniform, he stood tall as he walked to his parents and grabbed their hands through the barrier separating them, telling them, &quot;I have no hatred. I have put everything behind me.&quot; His father replied, &quot;You will go down in history – there is such a thing as justice.&quot;

After Hans was led out, Sophie was brought in. Dressed in civilian clothes, she smiled happily, pleased to see her parents. After speaking for a few minutes, her mother grasped her hands and said, &quot;You know, Sophie – Jesus.&quot; &quot;Yes, but you too,&quot; Sophie replied. She walked out of the room, head held high.

A few minutes before the execution, the three of them were allowed to be together for a short while. While there, they were given a cigarette to share. Probst is credited with remarking, &quot;I didn’t know dying could be so easy.&quot; At around 5 pm, the executioners came for Sophie. After a few minutes, a dull thump was heard. The executioner came for Hans next. Unlike Sophie, who had gone to her death silently, Hans shouted &quot;Es lebe die Freiheit!&quot; (&quot;Long live freedom!&quot;) as the blade came down. Christoph was the last to be executed. He was unable to see any of his family before he died.

After the trial of Hans, Sophie, and Probst, three more trials of the White Rose members took place. In the end, 29 people were accused of being members of the White Rose; 16 were executed and 13 were given prison sentences ranging from six months to 10 years.

==Legacy==

Following the deaths, a copy of the sixth leaflet was smuggled out of Germany through Scandinavia to the UK by German jurist Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, where it was used by the Allied Forces. In July 1943, they dropped millions of copies of the tract, retitled The Manifesto of the Students of Munich, over Germany.

The White Rose&#x27;s legacy has been considered significant by many historical commentators, both as a demonstration of exemplary spiritual courage, and as a well-documented case of social dissent in a time of violent repression, censorship, and pressure to conform.

Playwright Lillian Garrett-Groag stated in &quot;Newsday&quot; (22 February 1993):
It is possibly the most spectacular moment of resistance that I can think of in the twentieth century... The fact that five little kids, in the mouth of the wolf, where it really counted, had the tremendous courage to do what they did, is spectacular to me. I know that the world is better for them having been there, but I do not know why.

In the same issue of &quot;Newsday&quot;, Holocaust historian Jud Newborn noted:
You cannot really measure the effect of this kind of resistance in whether or not X number of bridges were blown up or a regime fell... The White Rose really has a more symbolic value, but that&#x27;s a very important value.

It was not until the 1998 law to abolish Nazi judgments of injustice in the administration of criminal justice that the sentences against Hans Scholl and other members of the White Rose became void in Germany.

In 2003, Germans were invited by television broadcaster ZDF to participate in &quot;Unsere Besten&quot; (Our Best), a nationwide competition to choose the top ten most important Germans of all time. Voters under the age of 40 helped Scholl and his sisters to finish in fourth place, above Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johannes Gutenberg, Otto von Bismarck, Willy Brandt, and Albert Einstein. If the votes of young viewers alone had been counted, Sophie and Hans Scholl would have been ranked first.

The Audimax of the Bundeswehr Medical Academy in Munich was named after Hans Scholl in 2012.

==In film==
Three films have been produced about the White Rose:

*Hans was portrayed by Michael Cornelius in the film &quot;Fünf Letze Tage&quot; (1982)
*Hans was portrayed by Wulf Kessler in the film &quot;Die Weisse Rose&quot; (1982)
*Hans was portrayed by Fabian Hinrichs in the film &quot;Sophie Scholl – The Final Days&quot; (2005).

<text>Sophia Magdalena Scholl (9 May 1921 – 22 February 1943) was a German student and anti-Nazi political activist, active in the White Rose non-violent resistance group in Nazi Germany.

She was convicted of high treason after having been found distributing anti-war leaflets at the University of Munich with her brother, Hans. For her actions, she was executed by guillotine. Since the 1960s, Scholl has been extensively commemorated for her anti-Nazi resistance.

== Early life ==
Scholl was the daughter of Magdalena (née Müller) and Robert Scholl, a liberal politician and ardent Nazi critic, who was the mayor of her home town of Forchtenberg am Kocher in the Free People&#x27;s State of Württemberg at the time of her birth. She was the fourth of six children:

# Inge Aicher-Scholl (1917–1998)
# Hans Scholl (1918–1943)
# Elisabeth Hartnagel-Scholl (27 February 1920 – 28 February 2020), married Sophie&#x27;s long-term boyfriend, Fritz Hartnagel
# Sophie Scholl (1921–1943)
# Werner Scholl (1922–1944) missing in action and presumed dead in June 1944
# Thilde Scholl (1925–1926)

Scholl was brought up in the Lutheran church. She started school at the age of seven, learned easily, and had a carefree childhood. In 1930, the family moved to Ludwigsburg and then two years later to Ulm where her father had a business consulting office.
In 1932, Scholl began attending a secondary school for girls. At the age of 12, she joined the female branch of the Hitler Youth, &quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot; (League of German Girls), as did most of her classmates. Her initial enthusiasm gradually gave way to criticism. She was aware of the dissenting political views of her father, friends, and some teachers. Her brother Hans, who had at first participated enthusiastically in the Hitler Youth program, became entirely disillusioned with the Nazi Party. Political positions had become an essential criterion in her choice of friends. The arrest of her brothers and friends in 1937 for participating in the German Youth Movement left a strong impression on her.

An avid reader, she developed a growing interest in philosophy and theology. She had a talent for drawing and painting, and came into contact with a few so-called &quot;degenerate&quot; artists. All of the Scholl children had a deep interest in art, and befriended many artists of the time, particularly controversial ones who stood against National Socialism and explored such themes in their work. One such artist, Otl Aicher, helped Sophie learn to sketch and helped her revise her drawings. He later married her sister Inge.

Sophie was first arrested by the Gestapo at the age of 16, after her brother Hans was discovered to be active in an anti-Hitler Youth group called &quot;Deutsche Jungenschaft vom 1.11.1929&quot;. The Gestapo arrested Hans at his military post and other security agents arrested his siblings Inge, Werner and Sophie at their home shortly thereafter. Sophie was released later the same day, while Inge and Werner were jailed for a week. Hans spent a full three weeks in prison where he underwent interrogation. He was released only after the intervention of his cavalry officer. This experience further solidified Sophie&#x27;s anti-Nazi convictions.

In spring of 1940 she graduated from secondary school, where the subject of her essay was &quot;The Hand that Moved the Cradle, Moved the World, a poem by William Ross Wallace&quot;. Scholl almost did not graduate, having lost all interest in participating in classes that had largely become Nazi indoctrination. Being fond of children, she became a kindergarten teacher at the Fröbel Institute in Ulm. She also chose that job in the hope that it would be recognized as an alternative service in the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (National Labor Service), a prerequisite for admission to university. This was not the case, and in spring of 1941 she began a six-month stint in the auxiliary war service as a nursery school teacher in Blumberg. The quasi military regimen of the Labor Service caused her to rethink her understanding of the political situation and to begin practising passive resistance.

After her six months in the National Labor Service, she enrolled in May 1942 in the University of Munich as a student of biology and philosophy. Her brother Hans, who was studying medicine at the same institution, introduced her to his friends. Although this group of friends eventually became known for their political views, they were initially drawn together by a shared love of art, music, literature, philosophy, and theology. Hiking in the mountains, skiing, and swimming were also important to them. They often attended concerts, plays and lectures together.

In Munich, Scholl met a number of artists, writers and philosophers, particularly Carl Muth and Theodor Haecker. The question they pondered most was how the individual must act under a dictatorship. During the summer of 1942, Scholl had to do war service in a metalworking plant in Ulm. At the same time, her father was serving time in prison for having made a critical remark to an employee about Adolf Hitler.

== Origins of the White Rose ==

Between 1940 and 1941, Sophie Scholl&#x27;s brother Hans, a former member of the Hitler Youth, began questioning the principles and policies of the Nazi regime. As a student at the University of Munich, Hans met two Roman Catholic men of letters who gave him a new orientation in life, inspiring him to turn from studying medicine to the pursuit of religion, philosophy and the arts. Together with like-minded friends, Alexander Schmorell, Willi Graf and Jurgen Wittenstein, he eventually adopted a strategy of passive resistance toward the Nazis by writing and publishing leaflets that called for the overthrow of National Socialism. The anonymous authors called themselves the &quot;White Rose&quot;.

The activities of the White Rose began in June 1942. By mid-July 1942, Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell had written the first four leaflets. Quoting extensively from the Bible, Aristotle, and Novalis, as well as Goethe and Schiller, the iconic poets of the German bourgeoisie, they appealed to what they considered the German intelligentsia, believing that such people would be easily convinced by the same arguments that motivated the authors themselves. The leaflets were left in the telephone books in public telephone booths, mailed to professors and students, and taken by courier to other universities for further distribution.

Sophie is believed to have first learned about the White Rose in July 1942, but Fritz Hartnagel remembers her asking him in May 1942 if he could get her a pass to buy a duplicating machine (which could not be obtained in Nazi Germany except by permit), which suggests that she may have known about the activities earlier. Whenever she joined, she proved to be valuable to the group because, as a woman, she was less likely to be randomly stopped by the SS.

== Arrest and execution ==
On 18 February 1943, Sophie and Hans Scholl went to Ludwig Maximilian University to leave flyers out for the students to read. The Scholls brought a suitcase full of leaflets to the university main building, and hurriedly dropped stacks of copies in the empty corridors for students to find when they left the lecture rooms. Leaving before the lectures had ended, the Scholls had some copies left in the suitcase and decided to distribute them. Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university maintenance man, Jakob Schmid, a self-avowed Nazi, who had joined the Nazi Party in 1937. 

Hans and Sophie Scholl were taken into custody by the Gestapo. A draft of a seventh pamphlet, written by Christoph Probst, was found in the possession of Hans Scholl at the time of his arrest. While Sophie Scholl was able to hide incriminating evidence in an empty classroom just before being captured, Hans tried to destroy the draft of the last leaflet by tearing it apart and swallowing it. The Gestapo recovered enough of it to read what it said and, when pressed, Hans gave the name of the author, Christoph Probst. In the record of his second interrogation, he stated, &quot;The piece of paper that I tore up following my arrest this morning originated with Christoph Probst... All other persons with the exception of Probst are in my opinion not guilty.&quot; Christoph Probst was captured on 20 February 1943.

The main Gestapo interrogator was Robert Mohr, who initially thought Sophie was innocent. However, after Hans had confessed, Sophie assumed full responsibility in an attempt to protect other members of the White Rose.

In court before Judge Roland Freisler on 22 February 1943, Scholl was recorded as saying these words:
This was their only defense; they were not allowed to call witnesses.
On 22 February 1943, Scholl, her brother Hans, and their friend Christoph Probst were found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. They were all beheaded by guillotine by the executioner Johann Reichhart in Munich&#x27;s Stadelheim Prison. Sophie was executed at 5:00 p.m., Hans at 5:02 p.m. and Christoph at 5:05 p.m. The execution was supervised by Walter Roemer, the head of enforcement of the Munich district court. Prison officials were impressed by the condemned prisoners&#x27; bravery, and let them smoke cigarettes together before they were executed.

Sophie&#x27;s last known words are disputed, although Else Gebel remembers the last words Sophie said to her as:

As for her last words, they were most likely either &quot;God, my refuge unto eternity&quot; or &quot;The sun still shines.&quot;

Fritz Hartnagel was evacuated from Stalingrad in January 1943, but did not return to Germany before Sophie was executed. In October 1945, he married Sophie&#x27;s sister Elisabeth.

== Legacy ==
After Scholl&#x27;s death, a copy of the sixth leaflet was smuggled out of Germany through Scandinavia to England by the German jurist Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, where it was used by the Allied Forces. In mid-1943, the Royal Air Force dropped millions of copies of the tract, retitled &quot;The Manifesto of the Students of Munich&quot;, over Germany as propaganda.

The playwright Lillian Garrett-Groag said in &quot;Newsday&quot; on 22 February 1993, &quot;It is possibly the most spectacular moment of resistance that I can think of in the twentieth century ... The fact that five little kids, in the mouth of the wolf, where it really counted, had the tremendous courage to do what they did, is spectacular to me. I know that the world is better for them having been there, but I do not know why.&quot;

In the same issue of &quot;Newsday&quot;, the Holocaust historian Jud Newborn observed, &quot;You cannot really measure the effect of this kind of resistance in whether or not X number of bridges were blown up or a regime fell ... The White Rose really has a more symbolic value, but that&#x27;s a very important value.&quot;

On 22 February 2003, a bust of Scholl was placed by the government of Bavaria in the Walhalla temple. She was the fifth woman to receive that honor.

The Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science at the University of Munich is named in honour of Sophie and Hans Scholl. The Institute is home to the university&#x27;s political science and communication departments, and is housed in the former Radio Free Europe building close to the Englischer Garten.

Many schools as well as countless streets and squares in Germany and Austria have been named after Scholl and her brother.

In 2003, Germans were invited by television broadcaster ZDF to participate in &quot;Unsere Besten&quot; (Our Best), a nationwide competition to choose the top ten most important Germans of all time. Voters under the age of 40 helped Scholl and her brother Hans to place fourth, above Bach, Goethe, Gutenberg, Bismarck, Willy Brandt, and Albert Einstein. If the votes of young viewers alone had been counted, Sophie and Hans Scholl would have been ranked first. Several years earlier, readers of &quot;Brigitte&quot;, a German women&#x27;s magazine, voted Scholl &quot;the greatest woman of the twentieth century&quot;.

On 9 May 2014, Google depicted Scholl for its Google Doodle on the occasion of what would have been her 93rd birthday.

In April 2021, the German Ministry of Finance issued a commemorative sterling silver €20 coin celebrating the 100th anniversary of Scholl&#x27;s May birth and a commemorative stamp in May.

===Cultural legacy===
==== Film and television ====
In the 1970s and 1980s, there were three film accounts of Sophie Scholl and the White Rose resistance. The first TV film &quot;&quot; (1971) focused on the university maintenance man Jakob Schmid, who denounced Scholl and the other White Rose members. The TV film was produced for the West German ZDF. Percy Adlon&#x27;s &quot;Fünf letzte Tage&quot; (&quot;Five Last Days&quot;, 1982) presented Lena Stolze as Scholl in her last days from the point of view of her cellmate Else Gebel. Stolze repeated the role in Michael Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Die Weiße Rose&quot; (&quot;The White Rose&quot;, 1982). In an interview, Stolze said that playing the role was &quot;an honour&quot;.

In February 2005, a film about Scholl&#x27;s last days, &quot;Sophie Scholl – Die letzten Tage (Sophie Scholl – The Final Days)&quot;, featuring Julia Jentsch in the title role, was released. Drawing on interviews with survivors and transcripts that had remained hidden in East German archives until 1990, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in January 2006. For her portrayal of Scholl, Jentsch won the best actress at the European Film Awards, best actress at the German Film Awards (Lolas), along with the Silver Bear for best actress at the Berlin Film Festival.

The German TV docudrama &quot;Frauen die Geschichte machten – Sophie Scholl&quot; was broadcast in 2013. Sophie Scholl was played by Liv Lisa Fries.

She was portrayed by Victoria Chilap in the documentary movie &quot;Death of a Nation&quot; in 2018.

==== In literature ====

In February 2010, Carl Hanser Verlag released &quot;Sophie Scholl: A Biography&quot; (in German), by Barbara Beuys.

==== In theatre ====
American playwright Lillian Garrett-Groag&#x27;s play &quot;The White Rose&quot; features Scholl as a major character.

&quot;We Will Not Be Silent&quot;, a dramatization by David Meyers of Scholl&#x27;s imprisonment and interrogation, premiered at the Contemporary American Theater Festival in Shepherdstown, West Virginia in July, 2017.

In later life Whitney Seymour, his wife Catryna, and their daughters Tryntje and Gabriel, co-wrote and produced Stars in the Dark Sky, a one-act play about Hans and Sophie Scholl and their role in the White Rose resistance group in Nazi Germany in the 1940s. The play, which took around five years to write, was released in 2008 (when Seymour was 85) and had five performances off-Broadway.

==== In music ====
George Donaldson, a Scottish folk singer wrote a song called &quot;The White Rose&quot; on an album titled the same, about Sophie and the White Rose movement.

The English punk band Zatopeks released an eponymous love song for Sophie Scholl on their debut album (2005).

Mickey 3D, a French rock band, wrote a song called &quot;La Rose Blanche&quot; on an album titled &quot;Sebolavy&quot; (2016).

American rock band Sheer Mag recorded a song called &quot;(Say Goodbye to) Sophie Scholl&quot; on its 2017 debut album &quot;Need to Feel Your Love&quot;.

Reg Meuross, a British folk singer, released &quot;For Sophie&quot; on his album &quot;Faraway People&quot; in 2017.

The title track from singer/songwriter James Maddock&#x27;s 2020 album, &quot;No Time To Cry,&quot; is about Sophie and her involvement in the White Rose movement.

==== Social media ====
Under the title &quot;@ichbinsophiescholl&quot; the German broadcasters Südwestrundfunk and Bayerische Rundfunk began in May 2021 an Instagram project to commemorate Scholl&#x27;s 100th birthday. The last months of Scholl&#x27;s life are featured on Instagram posts and stories styled as if Scholl herself were posting them. Swiss actress Luna Wedler plays Sophie Scholl and illustrates the last year of her life in the style of a modern digital influencer.

Young people had difficulties to distinguish between the historical Scholl and her fictionalized version; many followers were emotionalized and defended the fictional Scholl as their heroine when the project met criticism. The creators had mixed historical facts with fiction. The project hardly informed about the ideals of Scholl. Followers identified themselves with Scholl and contributed in the comments sentimental stories of their grandparents that were portrayed mainly as victims and not as Hitler&#x27;s supporters.

Céline Wendelgaß of Bildungsstätte Anne Frank noticed that the project lacked an educational framework. The Instagram posts nourished certain narratives, like the idea that there was a lot of resistance in Germany. German soldiers are portrayed exclusively as traumatized persons without mentioning war crimes committed by German soldiers.

<doc id="240889" wikidata="Q1338786" url="?curid=240889" title="Blushing">
<text>Blushing or erubescence is the reddening of a person&#x27;s face due to psychological reasons. It is normally involuntary and triggered by emotional stress associated with passion, embarrassment, shyness, fear, anger, or romantic stimulation.

Severe blushing is also common in people who have social anxiety in which the person experiences extreme and persistent anxiety in social and performance situations.

==Description ==
Blushing is generally distinguished, despite a close physiological relation, from flushing, which is more intensive and extends over more of the body, and seldom has a mental source. Idiopathic craniofacial erythema is a medical condition where a person blushes strongly with little or no provocation. People who have social phobia are particularly prone to idiopathic craniofacial erythema.

==Physiology==

A blush is a reddening of the cheeks and forehead brought about by increased capillary blood flow in the skin. It can also extend to the ears, neck and upper chest, an area termed the &#x27;blush region&#x27;.

There is evidence that the blushing region is anatomically different in structure. The facial skin, for example, has more capillary loops per unit area and generally more vessels per unit volume than other skin areas. In addition, blood vessels of the cheek are wider in diameter, are nearer the surface, and visibility is less diminished by tissue fluid. These specific characteristics of the architecture of the facial vessels led Wilkin in an overview of possible causes of facial flushing to the following conclusion: &quot;[...] Increased capacity and greater visibility can account for the limited distribution of flushing&quot;.

Evidence for special vasodilation mechanisms was reported by Mellander and his colleagues (Mellander, Andersson, Afzelius, &amp; Hellstrand. 1982). They studied buccal segments of the human facial veins in vitro. Unlike veins from other areas of the skin, facial veins responded with an active myogenic contraction to passive stretch and were therefore able to develop an intrinsic basal tone. Additionally Mellander et al. showed that the veins in this specific area were also supplied with beta-adrenoceptors in addition to the common alpha-adrenoceptors. These beta-adrenoceptors could exert a dilator mechanism on the above-described basal tone of the facial cutaneous venous plexus. Mellander and his colleagues propose that this mechanism is involved in emotional blushing.

Drummond has partially confirmed this effect by pharmacological blocking experiments (Drummond. 1997). In a number of trials, he blocked both alpha-adrenergic receptors (with phentolamine) and beta-adrenergic receptors (with propranolol introduced transcutaneously by iontophoresis). Blushing was measured at the forehead using a dual channel laser Doppler flowmeter. Subjects were undergraduate students divided into frequent and infrequent blushers according to self-report. Their mean age was 22.9 years, which is especially favorable for assessing blushing, since young subjects are more likely to blush and blush more intensively. The subjects underwent several procedures, one of which was designed to produce blushing. 

Alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine had no influence on the amount of blushing in frequent or in infrequent blushers, indicating that release of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone does not substantially influence blushing. This result was expected since vasoconstrictor tone in the facial area is known to be generally low (van der Meer. 1985). Beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol on the other hand decreased blushing in both frequent and infrequent blushers. However, despite complete blockade, blood flow still increased substantially during the embarrassment and blushing inducing procedure. Additional vasodilator mechanisms must therefore be involved.

==Psychology==
Charles Darwin devoted Chapter 13 of his 1872 &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; to complex emotional states including self-attention, shame, shyness, modesty and blushing. He described blushing as &quot;... the most peculiar and most human of all expressions.&quot;

Several different psychological and psycho-physiological mechanisms for blushing have been hypothesized by Crozier (2010): &quot;An explanation that emphasizes the blush&#x27;s visibility proposes that when we feel shame we communicate our emotion to others and in doing so we send an important signal to them. It tells them something about us. It shows that we are ashamed or embarrassed, that we recognise that something is out of place. It shows that we are sorry about this. It shows that we want to put things right. To blush at innuendo is to show awareness of its implications and to display modesty that conveys that you are not brazen or shameless. The blush makes a particularly effective signal because it is involuntary and uncontrollable. Of course, a blush can be unwanted [but the] costs to the blusher on specific occasions are outweighed by the long-term benefits of being seen as adhering to the group and by the general advantages the blush provides: indeed the costs may enhance the signal&#x27;s perceived value.&quot; A number of techniques may be used to help prevent or reduce blushing. The most extreme of these interventions is a surgical technique known as endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy.

Salzen (2010) suggested that blushing and flushing were manifestations of the physiological impact of the instinctual fight/flight mechanism, when neither confrontation nor retreat is possible.

Blushing has been linked to activation in the cerebellum and the left paracentral lobe.

<doc id="240891" wikidata="Q57812" url="?curid=240891" title="Kurt Huber">
<text>Kurt Huber (24 October 1893 – 13 July 1943) was a German university professor and resistance fighter with the anti-Nazi group White Rose. For his involvement he was imprisoned and guillotined.

==Early life==

Huber was born in Chur, Switzerland, to German parents. He was raised in Stuttgart and later, after his father&#x27;s death, in Munich. As a young child, he had suffered acute diphtheria. His larynx had been slit to save his life, but he never completely recovered. For the rest of his life, he walked with a heavy limp and had trouble speaking. Regardless of this, Huber, who showed an aptitude for such subjects as music, philosophy and psychology, became a professor of psychology and music in 1926 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Huber never let his disabilities stop him. During his teaching, he was known for teaching classes that did not push Nazi ideology, which made him a favorite with the university students.

==Resistance==
Huber was appalled by the rise of the Nazi Party and decided that Adolf Hitler and his government had to be removed from power. He came into contact with the White Rose movement through some students who attended his lectures, Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell. In January 1943, Huber helped edit the fifth White Rose leaflet. He wrote the White Rose&#x27;s sixth leaflet calling for an end to National Socialism. It was the last leaflet to be published (Christoph Probst wrote an unpublished seventh leaflet). The sixth leaflet was published in its entirety, except for a paragraph praising the &quot;Luftwaffe.&quot; Schmorell and Scholl scratched the line, as they believed that it was wrong to support any branch of the army in Nazi Germany. Disgruntled, Huber walked out of the meeting. It was the last time that he saw Hans Scholl.

== Arrest ==
Huber&#x27;s political activities came to the attention of the Gestapo and he was arrested on 27 February 1943. By coincidence, composer Carl Orff came to visit the next day. Huber&#x27;s distraught wife, Clara (née Schlickenrieder, 1908–1998), hoped Orff would use his influence to help her husband, but he said that he feared he was &quot;ruined.&quot; Clara Huber later said she never saw Orff again, but there is documentary evidence that they had further contact. After the war, she asked Orff to contribute to a memorial volume for her husband; he contributed an emotional letter written directly to Huber. Orff&#x27;s &quot;Die Bernauerin&quot;, a project which he completed in 1946 and which he had discussed with Huber before the latter&#x27;s execution, is dedicated to Huber&#x27;s memory. The final scene of this work, which is about the wrongful execution of Agnes Bernauer, depicts a guilt-ridden chorus begging not to be implicated in the title character&#x27;s death.

== Trial and execution ==
Huber was brought before the People&#x27;s Court on 19 April. In a brief show trial, Chief Justice Roland Freisler subjected Huber to a humiliating verbal attack. He was sentenced to death for insurrection.

On 13 July, he was alerted that Alexander Schmorell and he were to be executed by guillotine later that day. The executions were supposed to be carried out at 5 pm, but as Huber prepared himself, he learned that the execution would be delayed. Several SS officers had appeared at Stadelheim under orders to observe the execution to see how long it took for each man to die; the SS officers were then supposed to report back to their superiors with suggestions on how to shorten or prolong the suffering of the man being hanged. The officers were put off when they learned that the execution was to be by guillotine and not hanging. They then demanded a detailed explanation of how the guillotine worked, so their time was not wasted. The execution was delayed until the SS officers left. At around 5 pm, the guards came for Alexander Schmorell. A few minutes later, the guards came for Kurt Huber.

The university had stripped Huber of his position and his doctorate at the time of his arrest. Attempts to take up a collection for Huber&#x27;s widow Clara eventually led to Hans Leipelt&#x27;s arrest and execution.

==Legacy==
The square opposite from the main building of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich was named Professor Huber Platz in his memory. Huber wrote a biography of Gottfried Leibniz which he completed while in prison and which was published in 1951 after being edited by his wife and pupil. After the war, a memorial volume with contributions from his friends and colleagues, including the 1946 letter from Carl Orff, was published by his widow.

<doc id="240894" wikidata="Q859413" url="?curid=240894" title="Big Sur">
<text>Big Sur () is a rugged and mountainous section of the Central Coast of the U.S. state of California, between Carmel Highlands and San Simeon, where the Santa Lucia Mountains rise abruptly from the Pacific Ocean. It is frequently praised for its dramatic scenery. Big Sur has been called the &quot;longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States&quot;, a sublime &quot;national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development&quot;, and &quot;one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation&quot;. The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a popular destination for visitors from across the world. With 4.5 to 7 million visitors annually, it is among the top tourist destinations in the United States, comparable to Yosemite National Park, but with considerably fewer services, and less parking, roads, and related infrastructure.

Big Sur Village is a collection of small roadside businesses and homes. The larger region known as Big Sur does not have specific boundaries but is generally considered to include the segment of California State Route 1 between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands in the north and San Carpóforo Creek near San Simeon in the south, as well as the entire Santa Lucia range between these creeks. The interior region is mostly uninhabited, while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated, with between 1,800 and 2,000 year-round residents and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among four small settlements. The region remained one of the most inaccessible areas of California and the entire United States until, after 18 years of construction, the Carmel–San Simeon Highway (now signed as part of State Route 1) was completed in 1937. Along with the ocean views, this winding, narrow road, often cut into the face of towering seaside cliffs, dominates the visitor&#x27;s experience of Big Sur. The highway has been closed more than 55 times by landslides, and in May 2017, a slide blocked the highway at Mud Creek, north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo County line, to just south of Gorda. The road was reopened on July 18, 2018.

The region is protected by the Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, which preserves it as &quot;open space, a small residential community, and agricultural ranching.&quot; Approved in 1986, the plan is one of the most restrictive local-use programs in the state, and is widely regarded as one of the most restrictive documents of its kind anywhere. The program protects viewsheds from the highway and many vantage points, and severely restricts the density of development. About 60% of the coastal region is owned by governmental or private agencies which do not allow any development. The majority of the interior region is part of the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, Silver Peak Wilderness or Fort Hunter Liggett.

== Location ==

Big Sur is not an incorporated town but a region without formal boundaries in California&#x27;s Central Coast region. The region is often confused with the small community of buildings and services south of Carmel in the Big Sur River valley, sometimes referred to by locals as Big Sur Village, but officially known as Big Sur.

=== Historical boundaries ===
The various informal boundaries applied to the region have gradually expanded north and south over time. Esther Pfeiffer Ewoldson, who was born in 1904 and was a granddaughter of Big Sur pioneers Michael and Barbara Pfeiffer, wrote that the region extended from the Little Sur River south to Slates Hot Springs. Members of the Harlan Family, who homesteaded the Lucia region south of Slates Hot Springs, said that Big Sur was &quot;miles and miles to the north of us.&quot; Prior to the construction of Highway 1, residents on the south coast had little contact with residents to the north of them.

=== Northern and southern boundaries ===
Most descriptions of the area refer to Malpaso Creek south of the Carmel River as the northern border. The southern border is generally accepted to be San Carpóforo Creek in San Luis Obispo County.

=== Inland extent ===
The vast majority of visitors only see Big Sur&#x27;s dramatic coastline and consider the Big Sur region to include only the coastal flanks of the Santa Lucia Mountains, which at various points extend from inland.

Some residents place the eastern border at the boundaries of the vast inland areas comprising the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, and Silver Peak Wilderness, or the unpopulated regions all the way to the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Mountains. Author and local historian Jeff Norman considered Big Sur to extend inland to include the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Big Sur&quot; has its origins in the area&#x27;s early Spanish history. While the Portolá expedition was exploring Alta California, they arrived at San Carpóforo Canyon near present-day San Simeon on September 13, 1769. Unable to penetrate the difficult terrain along the coast, they detoured inland through the San Antonio and Salinas Valleys before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it the provincial capital.

The Spanish referred to the vast and relatively unexplored coastal region to the south of Monterey as &quot;el país grande del sur&quot;, meaning &#x27;the big country of the south&#x27;. This was often shortened to &quot;el sur grande&quot; &#x27;the big south&#x27;. The two major rivers draining this portion of the coast were named El Rio Grande del Sur and El Rio Chiquito del Sur.

The first recorded use of the name &quot;el Sud&quot; (meaning &#x27;the South&#x27;) was on a map of the Rancho El Sur land grant given by Governor José Figueroa to Juan Bautista Alvarado on July 30, 1834. The first American use of the name &#x27;Sur&#x27; was by the United States Coast Survey in 1851, which renamed a point of land that looked like an island and was shaped like a trumpet, known to the Spanish as &quot;Morro de la Trompa&quot; and &quot;Punta Que Parece Isla&quot;, to Point Sur.

Big Sur&#x27;s first post office was named &quot;Posts&quot; after William Brainard Post, in whose home it was located. He had obtained a patent to land at the top of the grade south of the Big Sur River, where he built a home in 1867. The English-speaking homesteaders petitioned the United States Post Office in Washington D.C. to change the name of their post office from Arbolado to Big Sur, and the rubber stamp using that name was returned on March 6, 1915, cementing the use of Big Sur as the place name.

== Popularity ==
=== Scenic designations ===
The section of Highway 1 running through Big Sur is widely considered one of the most scenic driving routes in the United States, if not the world. The views are one reason that Big Sur was ranked second among all United States destinations in TripAdvisor&#x27;s 2008 Travelers&#x27; Choice Destination Awards. The unblemished natural scenery owes much of its preservation to the highly restrictive development plans enforced in Big Sur; no billboards or advertisements are permitted along the highway and signage for businesses must be modestly scaled and of a rural nature conforming to the Big Sur region. The state of California designated the section of the highway from Cambria to Carmel Highlands as the first California Scenic Highway in 1965. In 1966, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson led the official scenic road designation ceremony at Bixby Creek Bridge. In 1996, the road became one of the first designated by the federal government as an &quot;All-American Road&quot; under the National Scenic Byways Program. CNN Traveler named McWay Falls as the most beautiful place in California.

=== Driving popularity ===
The drive along Highway 1 has been described as &quot;one of the best drives on Earth&quot;, and is considered one of the top 10 motorcycle rides in the United States. Highway 1 was named the most popular drive in California in 2014 by the American Automobile Association. The region receives as many as and sometimes more visitors than Yosemite National Park. Unlike the national park managed by a single entity, the Big Sur region is ruled over by multiple government and private land owners, offers only occasional bus service, limited parking, few restrooms, and a single, narrow two-lane highway that for most of its length clings to the steep coastal cliffs. North-bound traffic during the peak summer season and holiday weekends is often backed up for about from Big Sur Village to Carmel Highlands. Due to the large number of visitors during the summer, congestion and slow traffic between Carmel and Posts is becoming the norm. However, during the winter, the road is frequently closed due to washouts and slides.

=== Protection ===
Despite its popularity, the region is heavily protected to preserve the rural and natural character of the land. The entire Big Sur coast is located within the protected coastal zone established by the 1976 California Coastal Act. This includes land use within a defined &quot;coastal zone&quot; extending inland from up to . The California Coastal Commission has the authority to control the construction of any type, including buildings, housing, roads, as well as fire and erosion abatement structures, and can issue fines for unapproved construction. The Coastal Zone is specifically defined by law as an area that extends from the State&#x27;s seaward boundary of jurisdiction, and inland for a distance from the Mean High Tide Line of between a couple of hundred feet in urban areas, to up to five miles in rural areas. The Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, approved by the Monterey County Supervisors in 1981, states that the region is meant to be an experience that visitors transit through, not a destination. For that reason, development of all kinds is severely restricted.

== Attractions ==
Besides sightseeing from the highway, Big Sur offers hiking and outdoor activities. There are a large number of state and federal lands and parks, including McWay Falls at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, one of only two waterfalls in California that plunge directly into the ocean. The waterfall is located near the foundation of a grand stone cliffside house built in 1940 by Lathrop and Hélène Hooper Brown which was the region&#x27;s first electrified home. However, parking is very limited and usually unavailable on summer weekends and holidays.

Another notable landmark is Point Sur Lightstation, the only complete nineteenth century lighthouse complex open to the public in California.

The Ventana Wildlife Center near Andrew Molera State Park features a free Discovery Center that enables visitors to learn about the California Condor recovery program and other wildlife.

The Henry Miller Memorial Library is a nonprofit bookstore and arts center that opened in 1981 as a tribute to the writer. Miller lived in Big Sur from 1944 to February 1963 and wrote about Big Sur in his book Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch. It is a gathering place for locals and has become the focal point of individuals with a literary mind, a cultural center devoted to Miller&#x27;s life and work, and a popular attraction for tourists.

=== Beaches ===
There are a few small, scenic beaches that are accessible to the public and popular for walking, but usually unsuitable for swimming, because of unpredictable currents, frigid temperatures, and dangerous surf. The beach at Garrapata State Park is sometimes rated as the best beach in Big Sur. Depending on the season, visitors can view sea otters, sea lions, seals, and migrating whales from the beach. The beach is barely visible from Highway 1.

Pfeiffer Beach is very popular but is only accessible via the narrow Sycamore Canyon Road. The parking lot at the beach only accommodates 60 vehicles and is usually full on summer and holiday weekends. During the summer, a shuttle operates from the US Forest Service headquarters to the beach. The wide sandy expanse offers views of a scenic arch rock offshore. It is sometimes confused with the beach at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park to the south.

In the south, Sand Dollar Beach is the longest stretch of beach in Big Sur. It is popular with hikers and photographers for its views of nearby bluffs. The beach is south of the Big Sur village on Highway 1. A steep staircase leads down to the beach from the highway. Jade Cove, south of Sand Dollar Beach, is also sometimes popular with visitors.

Swiss Canyon Beach is a long, sandy beach visible when looking north from the mouth of the Big Sur River in Andrew Molera State Park. The eastern side of the beach is bounded by private land. The beach may be accessible from the southern end depending on the tide.

Some beaches are surrounded by private land. At the mouth of the Little Sur river are some of the largest dunes on the Big Sur coast. The mouth of the Little Sur River, the dunes, and the mile-long Little Sur River beach are within the boundaries of the El Sur Ranch and are inaccessible to the public. The owner of the ranch maintains a secure fence and has prominently posted &quot;Private Property&quot; and &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs on the fence along Highway 1 as suggested by legal precedent. While the beach below the mean high tide line is open to the public, the law does not permit individuals to trespass on private property to reach the public beach. Individuals who trespass to reach the beach have been cited.

Other beaches that are inaccessible to the public include Point Sur Beach, a long sandy beach located below and to the north of Point Sur Lighthouse. There is a small beach at Rocky Point that is surrounded by private property, making it inaccessible. The beach at the foot of McWay falls is physically inaccessible from the shore. To the south near the county line, Wreck Beach south of Pfeiffer Beach is not accessible. Gamboa Point Beach near the Monterey / San Luis Obispo count line is closed to the public.

=== Hiking ===
The Pine Ridge Trail (USFS 3E06) is the most popular hiking route into the Ventana Wilderness. Hikers can use it to access many campsites in the backcountry, including Ventana Camp, Terrace Creek, Barlow Flats, Sykes, and Redwood camps. When open, it is accessible from the Big Sur Station. The trail, connecting trails, and the campsites along its route were closed during the Soberanes Fire in July 2016. They were damaged by the fire itself and further damaged by the heavy rains during the following winter. , the trail was blocked by four major washouts and more than 100 fallen trees across the path. Reopening the trail will require an environmental assessment, and perhaps re-routing the trail entirely.

The Mt. Manuel Trail (USFS 2E06) begins within Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. It follows a northeasterly route up the slopes of Mt. Manuel. Hikers following this route can access Vado and Launtz Creek campsites. It connects to the Little Sur trail that provides access to the Little Sur River watershed. The trail is not maintained.

The North Coast Ridge Road (USFS 20S05) is accessible from the road to the Ventana Inn and indirectly from the south via Limekiln State Park. Parking is available in the north at Cadillac Flat near the Ventana Inn. From Ventana Inn, the trail climbs steeply to the crest of the coastal ridge and south about to near Cone Peak. There are wide views in all directions for almost the entire hike. It connects to several trails over its length, including Terrace Creek Trail (closed ), Boronda Trail, DeAngulo Trail, Big Sur Trail, Marble Peak Trail, Bee Camp Trail, Lost Valley Connector Trail, Rodeo Flat Trail, and the Arroyo Seco Trail. It provides access to Timber Top and Cold Spring Camp. It passes near the summit of Anderson Peak () and Marble Peak (), and through to the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road and through connects to the Cone Peak Road. It is not open to vehicular traffic or bicycles. , the trail is closed.

Garrapata State Park, Andrew Molera State Park, Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, and Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park all contain short hiking trails. , almost all trails on the east side of Highway 1 in these parks are closed due to the Soberanes Fire and damage sustained during heavy rains the following winter. Some trails west of Highway 1 are open.

=== Places of contemplation ===

Among the places that draw visitors is the once counterculture, later upscale Esalen Institute. Esalen hosted many figures of the nascent &quot;New Age&quot; and, in the 1960s, played an important role in popularizing Eastern philosophies, the &quot;Human Potential Movement&quot;, and Gestalt therapy in the United States. Esalen is named after the Native Americans who congregated there at the natural hot springs possibly for thousands of years. Far from the coast within the Los Padres National Forest, the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, accessible via a steep, narrow, dirt road, is only open to guests during the summer months.

Big Sur is also the location of a Catholic monastery, the New Camaldoli Hermitage. The Hermitage in Big Sur was founded in 1957. It rents a few simple rooms for visitors who would like to engage in silent meditation and contemplation. Normally all retreats are silent and undirected.


=== Special events ===
The Big Sur International Marathon is an annual marathon that begins south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and ends at the Crossroads Shopping Center in Carmel-by-the-Sea. The marathon was established in 1986 and attracts about 4,500 participants annually.

Civic leaders in Big Sur stage a run each year in October to raise funds for the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Big Sur Health Center. Since the race, known as the Big Sur River Run, was founded in 1971, more than $1,025,104 has been donated to the two organizations. The run through the redwoods was canceled in 2016 due to the Soberanes Fire and in 2017 due to winter storms.

The Big Sur Folk Festival was held from 1964 to 1971. It began unintentionally when Nancy Carlen, a friend of singer Joan Baez, organized a weekend seminar at the Esalen Institute in June 1964 titled &quot;The New Folk Music&quot;. On Sunday afternoon, they invited all the neighbors for a free, open performance. This became the first festival. The festival was held yearly on the grounds of the Esalen Institute, except for 1970, when it was held at the Monterey County Fairgrounds. Even when well-known acts like Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young or the Beach Boys performed, the event was purposefully kept small with no more than a few thousand in attendance.

== State and federal lands ==
=== State parks ===

The state parks in Big Sur grew out of the original residents&#x27; desire to protect and preserve the land they admired. &quot;The early settlers considered land stewardship their obligation to the community.&quot; The first was Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. John Pfeiffer, son of pioneers Michael Pfeiffer and Barbara Laquet, was offered $210,000 for his land near Sycamore Canyon by a Los Angeles developer, who wanted to build a subdivision on the land. Instead, Pfeiffer sold 700 acres (2.8 km2) to the state of California in 1933.

, portions of most of these parks are closed due to after effects of the Soberanes Fire.
From north to south, the following state parks are in use:

* Garrapata State Park
* Point Sur State Historic Park
* Andrew Molera State Park
* Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park
* Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park
* Limekiln State Park

=== State reserves ===
* John Little State Natural Reserve
* Big Creek State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area

=== Federal land ===
, some trails and campsites within the following areas are closed, due to damage caused by the 2016 Soberanes Fire and the following winter&#x27;s rains.

== Overuse issues ==
During most summer weekends and on all major holidays, Big Sur is overwhelmingly crowded. Although some Big Sur residents catered to adventurous travelers in the early twentieth century, the modern tourist economy began when Highway 1 opened the region to automobiles in 1937, but only took off after World War II-era gasoline rationing and a ban on pleasure driving ended in August 1945. Big Sur has become a destination for travelers both within the United States and internationally.

=== Increasing numbers of visitors ===
The number of visitors to Big Sur has risen from about 1.5 million in 1978, to about 3 million in 1980, to an estimated 4 to 5 million during 2014 and 2015, comparable to or greater than the number of visitors to Yosemite National Park. Unlike Yosemite, which is managed by a single federal entity, about one-quarter of the land in Big Sur is privately owned and the remainder is managed by a conglomeration of federal, state, local, and private agencies. Yosemite offers 5,400 parking spots and a free, daily, park-wide bus service. In Big Sur during the summer, there is a single public bus that runs three times daily and a single shuttle van that operates on Thursday through Sunday from the Big Sur Station to Pfeiffer Beach. The owner of the Nepenthe restaurant estimated in 2017 that the number of visitors had increased by 40% since 2011. Big Sur residents and business owners are concerned about the impact visitors are having on the region. Traffic and parking is consistently bad during summer and holidays weekends and some visitors don&#x27;t obey the laws.

Residents began discussing the potential necessity of shuttle buses, tollgates along Highway 1, and limits on the number of private autos allowed on the highway in 1978. One of the reasons for Big Sur&#x27;s popularity is that it is only a one-day drive for about 7 million people. With the advent of social media, hashtags like &quot;#sykeshotsprings&quot; and &quot;#pineridgetrail&quot;, two popular destinations within Big Sur, encourage more visitors. Visitors must pay $15 for a parking spot at a trailhead parking lot and take a 14-passenger van to Pfeiffer Beach.

The television series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, which is filmed in the Monterey and Big Sur area, has increased the number of visitors to the area.

=== Restricted public transportation ===
Public transportation is available to and from Monterey on Monterey–Salinas Transit. The summer schedule operates from Memorial Day to Labor Day three times a day, while the winter schedule only offers bus service on weekends. The route is subject to interruption due to wind and severe inclement weather.

=== Limited vehicle services ===
There are only six gas stations along Highway 1 in Big Sur, from Ragged Point in the south to Carmel Highlands in the north. Three of them are in the north near Big Sur Valley. The gas station at the Big Sur River Inn and Restaurant offers a steep discount to local residents. The filling station in Gorda has one of the highest prices in the United States, as it is far from the electrical grid and part of the cost of auto fuel is used to support the operation of a diesel generator. All of them only operate during regular business hours and none of them supply diesel fuel. There are three Tesla recharging stations near Posts.

=== Lack of restrooms ===

There are only 16 public restrooms along the entire coast to accommodate the almost 5 million annual visitors. The number of visitors far exceeds the available restrooms, and most restrooms are not available in locations where tourists frequently visit. Businesses report that the large number of visitors using their bathroom has overwhelmed their septic systems.

If visitors can locate them, they can use bathrooms within California State Parks or federal campgrounds without paying an entrance fee. But many of the bathrooms are not visible from Highway 1. This is due in part to the fact that restroom signs along Highway 1 were removed for aesthetic reasons.

As a result, visitors often resort to defecating in the bushes near locations like the Bixby Creek Bridge. Residents complain that visitors regularly defecate along Highway 1. Toilet paper, human waste, and trash litter the roadsides. Residents have taken it upon themselves to clean up after visitors. The California Department of Transportation, which cleans the roadside areas about once a week, finds human waste during every cleanup. Butch Kronlund, executive director of the Coast Property Owners Association, criticized the lack of restrooms. He says, &quot;It&#x27;s a &#x27;scenic highway&#x27; with piles of shit up and down the highway.&quot;

The 1976 California Coastal Act makes installing public bathrooms, trash bins, or even new road signs along Highway 1 extremely difficult. Several federal, state, and local agencies have jurisdiction in Big Sur, all of which must weigh in on decisions affecting residents and visitors.

=== Few visitors&#x27; services ===

The land use restrictions that preserve Big Sur&#x27;s natural beauty also mean that visitor accommodations are limited, often expensive, and places to stay fill up quickly during the busy summer season.

There are no urban areas, just three small clusters of restaurants, gas stations, motels, and camp grounds: Posts in the Big Sur River valley, Lucia, near Limekiln State Park, and Gorda, on the southern coast. Scattered among these distant settlements are nine small grocery stores, a few gift shops, and no chain hotels, supermarkets, or fast-food outlets, and no plans to add facilities or shopping. Among the places to stay and eat are the luxury Ventana Inn, Post Ranch, and the Nepenthe restaurant, built around the cabin Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth impulsively bought.

=== Limited accommodation ===

There are fewer than 300 hotel rooms on the entire stretch of Highway 1 between San Simeon and Carmel. Lodging include a few cabins, motels, and campgrounds, and higher-end resorts. There are some short-term rentals, but their legality is still being determined.

=== Illegal camping ===
Some social media sites report the availability of free camping on the side of roads, but camping of any sort or parking overnight along highways and local roads is illegal and violators are regularly cited. Sleeping in cars is illegal and subject to a $1000 fine. Casual campers have at times turned every wide spot along the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road into an illegal campsite, although there are no bathrooms or fire pits. Residents complain about illegal camp fires and people defecating along the road without using proper sanitation. Camping is only permitted within designated private and state or federal park campsites or within USFS lands.

On July 22, 2016, an illegal campfire within Garrapata State Park, where camping is not permitted, got out of control. The resulting Soberanes Fire burned , 57 homes and 11 outbuildings, and killed a bulldozer operator. It took almost three months to extinguish and cost about $236 million to suppress. In October, 2017, a visitor from Florida was arrested for starting an illegal campfire that grew out of control.

=== Solutions under consideration ===
The Community Association of Big Sur (formerly the Big Sur Property Owners Association) is proposing some solutions. They want to close the parking lot at Bixby Creek for a year to encourage visitors to take public transportation. They are considering asking community volunteers to keep tourists from walking onto the bridge, which is both dangerous and illegal. Tourists who want to get to Pfeiffer Beach over the mile-long, one-lane road to a small 65-car parking lot would be required to reserve and pay for parking ahead of time or take a shuttle. Parking on the highway shoulder at popular McWay Falls to avoid a $10 parking lot fee would be prohibited. Another idea under consideration is a ban on dispersed camping in the national forest during fire season &quot;until proper backcountry monitoring and enforcement exists.&quot; An illegal campfire in 2017 burned 57 homes and killed one firefighter. The Forest Service used to have several backcountry rangers but removed them all.

== Culture ==
The arrival of Bay Area artists in Carmel-by-the-Sea beginning in 1904 was the beginning of a literary and artistic colony on the northern edge of Big Sur. Robinson Jeffers moved to Carmel in September 1914, and over his lifetime wrote many evocative poems about the isolation and natural beauty of Big Sur. Beginning in the 1920s, his poetry introduced the romantic idea of Big Sur&#x27;s wild, untamed spaces to a national audience, which encouraged many of the later visitors.
Henry Miller moved to Big Sur at the invitation of the Greco-French artist Jean Varda, uncle of filmmaker Agnès Varda. He lived in Big Sur for almost 20 years, from 1944 to 1962. When he first arrived, he was broke and novelist Lynda Sargent was renting a cabin from a local riding club. She allowed Miller to live rent-free for a while. But when the cabin was sold to Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth in 1945, Miller moved several miles south to a wood cabin on Partington Ridge that had been owned by his friend Emil White.

While in Big Sur, Miller, avant-garde musician Harry Partch and Jean Varda were part of a local group of bohemians known as the Anderson Creek Gang, many of whom lived at the former highway work camp near the mouth of Anderson Creek. Miller lived in a shack there during 1946 before moving back to the cabin on Partington Ridge in 1947. In his 1957 essay/memoir/novel &quot;Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch&quot;, Miller described the joys and hardships that came from escaping the &quot;air-conditioned nightmare&quot; of modern life.

=== Bohemian reputation ===
Hunter S. Thompson worked as a security guard and caretaker at a resort in Big Sur Hot Springs for eight months in 1961, just before the Esalen Institute was founded at that location. While there, he published his first feature story in the nationally distributed men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Rogue&quot; about Big Sur&#x27;s artisan and bohemian culture. In the article, he described how the Bohemian image attracted people who annoyed residents:

Other writers and artists were also attracted by Big Sur, including Edward Weston, Richard Brautigan, Emile Norman and Jack Kerouac. Big Sur acquired a bohemian reputation with these newcomers. Kerouac followed Miller to Big Sur and included the rugged coast in large parts of two of his novels. He spent a few days in early 1960 at fellow poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti&#x27;s cabin in Bixby Canyon and based his novel &quot;Big Sur&quot; on his time there.

== Highway 1 impact ==

Before the construction of California State Route 1, the California coast south of Carmel and north of San Simeon was one of the most remote regions in the state, rivaling at the time nearly any other region in the United States for its difficult access. At the turn of the 19th century, the trip from Monterey to the Pfeiffer Ranch in the Big Sur valley could take three days by wagon. It was a rough road that ended in present-day Big Sur Village and could be impassible in winter. There was no road beyond the Pfeiffer Ranch, only a horseback trail connecting the homesteads to the south. The ride from Pfeiffer Ranch to San Carpóforo canyon was about in a direct line, but about three times that by horseback. J. Smeaton Chase, who traveled on horseback up the coast in 1911, reported that a stagecoach carried passengers from Posts (then named Arbolado) to the Everett Hotel in Monterey on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

The highway was first proposed by Dr. John L. D. Roberts, a physician who was summoned on April 21, 1894, to treat survivors of the wreck of the S.S. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (originally USRC &quot;Wayanda&quot;), which had run aground near the Point Sur Light Station about south of Carmel-by-the-Sea. The ride on his two-wheeled, horse-drawn cart took him hours, a very fast trip for the day. Construction began in 1921, ceased for two years in 1926 when funding ran out, and after 18 years of construction, the Carmel–San Simeon Highway was completed in 1937. The route was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as Highway 1 in 1939.

The highway is a dominant feature of the Big Sur coast, providing the primary means of access and transportation. The Big Sur portion of Highway 1 is generally considered to include the segment adjoining the unincorporated region of Big Sur between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands in the north and San Carpóforo Creek near San Simeon in the south.

Along with the ocean views, this winding, narrow road, often cut into the face of seaside cliffs, dominates the visitor&#x27;s experience of Big Sur. The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a destination for about 4.5 to 7 million people who live within a day&#x27;s drive and for visitors from elsewhere in the world.

The highway has been closed more than 55 times by landslides, and in May 2017, a slide blocked the highway at Mud Creek, north of Salmon Creek near the San Luis Obispo County line, to just south of Gorda. The road was reopened on July 18, 2018, but is subject to closure during heavy storms.

== Big Sur land use ==

The policies protecting land used in Big Sur are some of the most restrictive local-use standards in California, and are widely regarded as one of the most restrictive development protections anywhere. The program protects viewsheds from the highway and many vantage points and severely restricts the density of development. About 60% of the coastal region is owned by governmental or private agencies which do not allow any development. The majority of the interior region is part of the Los Padres National Forest, Ventana Wilderness, Silver Peak Wilderness, or Fort Hunter Liggett. The area is protected by the Big Sur Local Coastal Plan, which preserves it as &quot;open space, a small residential community, and agricultural ranching.&quot; Its intention is &quot;preserving the environment and visual access to it, the policies of the local coastal plan are to minimize, or limit, all destination activities.&quot;

The unincorporated region encompassing Big Sur does not have specific boundaries, but is generally considered to include the segment of California State Route 1 between Malpaso Creek near Carmel Highlands in the north and San Carpóforo Creek near San Simeon in the south, as well as the entire Santa Lucia range between these creeks. The interior region is mostly uninhabited, while the coast remains relatively isolated and sparsely populated, with between 1,800 and 2,000 year-round residents and relatively few visitor accommodations scattered among the four small settlements.

== History ==
=== Native Americans ===
Archaeological evidence shows that the Esselen lived in Big Sur as early as 3500 BC, leading a nomadic, hunter-gatherer existence.

The native people hollowed mortar holes into large exposed rocks or boulders which they used to grind the acorns into flour. These can be found throughout the region. Arrows were made of cane and pointed with hardwood foreshafts. The tribes also used controlled burning techniques to increase tree growth and food production. The population was limited as the Santa Lucia Mountains made the area relatively inaccessible and long-term habitation a challenge. The population of the Esselen who lived in the Big Sur area are estimated from a few hundred to a thousand or more.

=== Spanish exploration and settlement ===
The first Europeans to see Big Sur were Spanish mariners led by Juan Cabrillo in 1542, who sailed up the coast without landing. When Cabrillo sailed by, he described the coastal range as &quot;mountains which seem to reach the heavens, and the sea beats on them; sailing along close to land, it appears as though they would fall on the ships.&quot;

Two centuries passed before the Spaniards attempted to colonize the area. On September 13, 1769, an expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá were the first Europeans to enter the Big Sur region when they arrived at San Carpóforo Canyon near Ragged Point. While camping there, they were visited by six indigenous people who offered pinole and fish and received beads in exchange. They explored the coast ahead and concluded it was impassable. They were forced to turn inland up the steep arroyo. The march through the mountains was one of the most difficult portions of the expedition&#x27;s journey. The Spanish were forced to &quot;make a road with crowbar and pickaxe&quot;. Crespi wrote, &quot;The mountains which enclose it are perilously steep, and all are inaccessible, not only for men but also for goats and deer.&quot; From a high peak near the San Antonio River, they could see nothing but mountains in every direction. They reached Monterey on October 1. When they attempted to explore further south, the scouts found their way blocked by &quot;the same cliff that had forced us back from the shore and obliged us to travel through the mountains.&quot;

After the Spanish established the California missions in 1770, they baptized and forced the native population to labor at the missions. While living at the missions, the aboriginal population was exposed to diseases unknown to them, like smallpox and measles, for which they had no immunity, devastating the Native American population and their culture. Many of the remaining Native Americans assimilated with Spanish and Mexican ranchers in the nineteenth century.

In 1909, forest supervisors reported that three Indian families still lived within what was then known as the Monterey National Forest. The Encinale family of 16 members and the Quintana family with three members lived in the vicinity of The Indians (now known as Santa Lucia Memorial Park west of Ft. Hunger Liggett). The Mora family consisting of three members was living to the south along the Nacimiento-Ferguson Road.

=== Spanish ranchos ===
Along with the rest of Alta California, Big Sur became part of Mexico when it gained independence from Spain in 1821. But, due to its inaccessibility, only a few small portions of the Big Sur region were included in land grants given by Mexican governors José Figueroa and Juan Bautista Alvarado.

; Rancho Tularcitos
Rancho Tularcitos, of land, was granted in 1834 by Governor José Figueroa to Rafael Goméz. It was located in upper Carmel Valley along Tularcitos Creek.

; Rancho San Francisquito 

Rancho San Francisquito was a land grant given in 1835 by Governor José Castro to Catalina Manzanelli de Munrás. She was the wife of Esteban Munrás (1798–1850), a Monterey trader, amateur painter, and grantee of Rancho San Vicente. The grant was located in the upper Carmel Valley, inland and east of Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito.

; Rancho Milpitas
Rancho Milpitas was a land grant given in 1838 by governor Juan Alvarado to Ygnacio Pastor. The grant encompassed present-day Jolon and land to the west. When Pastor obtained title from the Public Land Commission in 1875, Faxon Atherton immediately purchased the land. By 1880, the James Brown Cattle Company owned and operated Rancho Milpitas and neighboring Rancho Los Ojitos. William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s Piedmont Land and Cattle Company acquired the rancho in 1925. In 1940, in anticipation of the increased forces required in World War II, the U.S. War Department purchased the land from Hearst to create a troop training facility known as the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation.

; Rancho El Sur
On July 30, 1834, Figueroa granted Rancho El Sur, two square leagues of land totalling 8,949-acres (3,622 ha), to Juan Bautista Alvarado. The grant extended from the Little Sur River to what became known as Cooper Point. Alvarado later traded Rancho El Sur for the more accessible Rancho Bolsa del Potrero y Moro Cojo in the northern Salinas Valley, owned by his uncle by marriage, Captain John B. R. Cooper. About one-half of Rancho El Sur is still an operating cattle ranch.

; Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito
In 1839, Alvarado granted Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito, also about two square leagues of land totalling , to Marcelino Escobar, a prominent official of Monterey. The grant was bounded on the north by the Carmel River and on the south by Palo Colorado Canyon.

In 1848, two days after the discovery of gold at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, Mexico ceded California to the United States as a result of the Mexican–American War.

=== First survey ===
During the first survey of the coast conducted by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1886, the surveyor reported:

=== Homesteaders ===
The first known European settler in Big Sur was John Davis who in 1853 built a cabin near the present-day site of the Mount Manuel Trail trailhead. In 1868, Native Americans Manual and Florence Innocenti bought Davis&#x27; cabin and land for $50.

John Bautista Rogers Cooper, born John Rogers Cooper, was a Yankee from the British Channel Islands who arrived in Monterey in 1823. He became a Mexican citizen, converted to Catholicism, and was given a Spanish name at his baptism. He married Native American Encarnacion Vallejo and acquired considerable land, including Rancho El Sur, on which he had a cabin built in April or May 1861. The Cooper Cabin is the oldest surviving structure in Big Sur.
William B. Post arrived in California in 1848 and was the foreman of the Soberanes Ranch when he built a single-room cabin in 1867. His son added to it in 1877, when the family moved there full-time. The Post House is a historic landmark and is on the grounds of the Ventana Inn resort.

Michael Pfeiffer, his wife, and four children arrived in Big Sur in 1869 to settle on the south coast. After reaching Sycamore Canyon, they found it to their liking and decided to stay. He filed a land patent on January 20, 1883, claiming two sections of land he already resided on near and immediately north of the mouth of Sycamore Canyon. They had six more children later on.

Another important pioneer-era historic resource is the Swetnam / Trotter House, a late 19th-century dwelling located at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon.

After the passage of the federal Homestead Act in 1862, a few hardy settlers were drawn by the promise of free 160-acre (65  ha) parcels. After the claimant filed for the land, they had gained full ownership after five years of residence or by paying $1.50 per acre within six months. Each claim was for 160 acres, a quarter section of free government land.

Other settlers included William F. Notley, who homesteaded at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon in 1891. He began harvesting tanoak bark from the canyon, a lucrative source of income at the time. Notley&#x27;s Landing is named after him. Isaac Swetnam worked for Notley and built a house at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon, which is still a residence. Sam Trotter, who also worked for Notley, later bought Swetnam&#x27;s house. He married Adelaide Pfeiffer, the daughter of Micheal Pfeiffer, and they raised a family there from 1906 to 1923.

William and Sarah (Barnes) Plaskett and their family settled in Pacific Valley in 1869. They built several homes and a saw mill. Homesteader John Junge built a one-room redwood cabin in 1920. The John Little State Natural Reserve straddling the mouth of Lime Creek preserves the original 1917 cabin of conservationist Elizabeth K. Livermore.

Many other local sites retain names from settlers during this period: Bottcher, Cooper&#x27;s Point, Gamboa, Anderson, Partington, Dani, Harlans, McQuades, Ross, and McWay are a few of the place names. Wilber Harlan, a native of Indiana, homesteaded near Lucia in 1885. His family descendants are still operating the Lucia Lodge.

=== Industrial era and gold rush ===


The local industries provided more work and supported a larger population than it does today. Jobs included harvesting lumber and tanoak bark, gold mining, and limestone processing.

From the 1860s through the start of the twentieth century, lumbermen cut down most of the readily accessible coast redwoods. Redwood harvesting further inland was always limited by the rugged terrain and difficulty in transporting the lumber to market. Redwood was cut in large amounts for use onsite in limestone kilns. Two companies operated large-scale limestone extraction and processing. The Monterey Lime Company operated near Long Ridge, east of Bixby Creek, and the Rockland Lime and Lumber Company operated a kiln at what later became known Limekiln Creek in the south.

William F. Notley was one of the first to harvest the bark of the Tanbark Oak from the Little Sur River canyon. Tanbark was used to manufacture tannic acid, necessary to the growing leather tanning industry located in Santa Cruz, and to preserve fish nets. The tanbark was harvested from the isolated trees inland, left to dry, corded, and brought out on mules or hauled out on &quot;go-devils&quot;. The go-devil was a wagon with two wheels on the front, while the rear had rails for pulling. A point on the Palo Colorado road is still nicknamed &quot;The Hoist&quot; because of the very steep road which required wagon-loads of tanbark and lumber to be hoisted by block and tackle hitched to oxen. The old block and tackle on a beam is still mounted between mailboxes.

The trip from Monterey to the Pfeiffer Ranch usually took all day by wagon. If the road was in bad shape, the stage driver only took a lightweight spring wagon. The rough road ended at the Pfeiffer Resort on the Big Sur River. It could be impassible in winter. Notley constructed a dog-hole port at the mouth of the Palo Colorado River, and a small village grew up from 1898 to 1907 around at what is known today as Notley&#x27;s Landing. Bixby built a sawmill on his property, and to get the lumber and lime to market, built a similar doghole port at the mouth of what was then known as Mill&#x27;s Creek, today as Bixby Creek. The tanbark was loaded by cable and a chute onto waiting vessels anchored offshore. In 1889, as much as 50,000 cords of tanbark were hauled out from the Little Sur River and Big Sur River watersheds. A cable hoist and chute were used to move goods to and from schooners anchored just offshore. Near the start of the 20th century, the tan oak trees were becoming seriously depleted, which slowly led to the demise of the industries they had created. Only the foundations of the doghole ports remain today.

In the 1880s, gold was found in the Los Burros District at Alder Creek in the mountains east of present-day Gorda. The gold rush town of Manchester at existed for a few short years. The town boasted a population of 200, four stores, a restaurant, five saloons, a dance hall, and a hotel, but it was abandoned soon after the start of the twentieth century and burned to the ground in 1909. Miners extracted about $150,000 in gold (about $ in ) during the mine&#x27;s existence.

Residents also received supplies by steamship that would make a trip once a year in the fall from San Francisco to Big Sur to drop off supplies that could not be transported by wagon. In 1894, ranch owners Post, Pfeiffer, and Castro hired the Pacific Coast Steamship Company&#x27;s steamer &quot;Bonita&quot; to bring lumber and seed oats to the mouth of the Big Sur River and Big Creek, north of Lucia. Lightering was used to transport freight to and from the beach. A large crowd gathered to receive supplies from and to load butter, honey, beans, wool, hides, and other products onto the ship.

In the late 1800s, the Ventana Power Company operated a sawmill near present-day Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. They began planning to build a dam on the Big Sur River just downstream of the confluence of Ventana Creek and the Big Sur River. They hoped to sell the electricity to the City of Monterey. They built a diversion channel along the Big Sur River, but the 1906 San Francisco earthquake bankrupted the company and they abandoned the project. The stonework from the diversion channel is still visible. Few other signs of this brief industrial period are visible. The rugged, isolated terrain kept out all but the sturdiest and most self-sufficient settlers. Travelers who ventured south of the Post Ranch rode horseback along trails that connected the various homesteaders along the coast.

The 1900 Monterey County voting register indicates 61 male voters in the Big Sur area. The majority (47) were either farmers or ranchers. Other trades included a gardener, apiarist, fruit grower, woodsman, laborer, lighthouse keeper, blacksmith, surveyor, miner, and teamster. Lumber-related occupations include bark peelers, woodchoppers, and wood overseers.

== Geography ==
=== Geology ===

The Santa Lucia Mountain Range, which dominates the Big Sur region, is long, extending from Carmel in the north to the Cuyama River in San Luis Obispo County. The range is never more than from the coast.

The Santa Lucia Mountains are characterized by extremely steep slopes, all associated with watersheds flowing directly or indirectly into the Pacific Ocean. The range forms the steepest coastal slope in the contiguous United States. The mountains are of recent tectonic origin, and its rugged, steep, and dissected deep stream canyons. The general trend of the range is northwest–southeast, paralleling the numerous faults that transect the area.

The topography is complex, however, reflecting active uplift and deformation, a variety of lithological types, rapidly incising stream networks, and highly unstable slopes. Stream channels and hill slopes are very steep, with average hill slope gradients exceeding 60% in some interior watersheds. The coastal side of the range rises directly from the shoreline, with oceanfront ridges rising directly to the crest of the coastal range. Big Sur&#x27;s Cone Peak, at an elevation of , is only from the ocean and is the tallest coastal mountain in the contiguous United States.

The basement rocks of the Santa Lucia Range contain Mesozoic Franciscan and Salinian Block rocks. The Franciscan complex is composed of greywacke sandstone and greenstone, with serpentinite bodies and other Ultramafic rocks present. Small areas of marble and limestone lenses form resistant outcrops that are prominent landscape features, often white to light gray. The Salinian block is made up of highly fractured, and deeply weathered meta-sediments, especially biotite schist and gneiss, intruded by plutonic (granitic) rocks such as quartz diorite and granodiorite. Both formations have been disrupted and tectonically slivered by motion on the San Andreas and associated fault systems. The Palo Colorado and Church Creek faults are prominent features influencing the linear northwest–southeast alignment of primary drainages.

=== Marine influence ===
Along with much of the central and northern California coast, Big Sur frequently has dense fog in summer. Fog and lack of precipitation during the summer both result from the North Pacific High&#x27;s presence offshore during that season. The high-pressure cell inhibits rainfall and generates northwesterly airflow. These prevailing summer winds from the northwest drive the ocean surface water slightly offshore (through the Ekman effect) which generates an upwelling of colder subsurface water. Warm surface air blowing over cold upwelling ocean water close to the coast is cooled to create a surface-based inversion. Summer fog is common below about elevation. During 2014 and 2015, researchers recorded summer seasonal totals of and of fog water drip under open shrub canopies. They concluded that precipitation from fog dripping into the soils under coastal shrub canopies can be as much as 50% of annual average rainfall rates. The fog usually moves out to sea during the day and closes in at night, but sometimes heavy fog blankets the coast all day.

== Wildfires ==

=== Historic fires ===
Fire plays a key role in the ecology of the upper slopes of the Big Sur region&#x27;s mountains where chaparral dominates the landscape. It is known that Native Americans burned chaparral to increase food production and promote grasslands for textiles, but little is known about the natural frequency of fire in the Santa Lucia Mountains. A study of fire scars on sugar pines on Junipero Serra Peak found that at least six fires had burned the region between 1790 and 1901. During the Spanish and Mexican era the Native Americans set fires regularly in coastal and valley grasslands to control brush growth and reduce fire risk. The European homesteaders followed that tradition and set controlled burns every winter when conditions were right.
Following the depopulation of the Native Americans from the region in the late 1800s, there have been several very large fires in the Big Sur area. In 1894, a fire burned for weeks through the upper watersheds of all of the major streams in the Big Sur region. Another large fire in 1898 burned without any effort by the few residents to put it out, except to save their buildings. In 1903, a fire started by an untended campfire near Chews Ridge burned a path wide to the coast over three months. In 1906, a fire that began in Palo Colorado Canyon from the embers of a campfire burned over 35 days and was finally extinguished by the first rainfall of the season. The number of fires declined when the U.S. Forest Service began managing the land in 1907.

=== Modern wildfires ===

In recent history, the area was struck by the Molera Fire in 1972, which resulted in flooding and mud flows in the Big Sur River valley that buried portions of several buildings the following winter. The area was burned by Marble Cone Fire in 1977, the Rat Creek Gorda Complex Fire in 1985, the Kirk Complex Fire in 1999, the Basin Complex Fire in 2008, the Pfeiffer Fire in December 2013, and the Soberanes Fire in 2016.
The Basin Complex Fire forced an eight-day evacuation of Big Sur and the closure of Highway 1, beginning just before the July 4, 2008 holiday weekend. The fire, which burned over , represented the largest of many lightning-caused wildfires that had broken out throughout California during the same period. Although the fire caused no loss of life, it destroyed 27 homes, and the tourist-dependent economy lost about a third of its expected summer revenue. The Pfeiffer Fire from December 17 to 20, 2013 burned and destroyed 34 homes in an area near Pfeiffer Ridge Road and Sycamore Canyon Road.

The July 2016 Soberanes Fire was caused by unknown individuals who started and lost control of an illegal campfire in the Garrapata Creek watershed. After it burned 57 homes in the Garrapata and Palo Colorado Canyon areas, firefighters were able to build lines around parts of the Big Sur community. A bulldozer operator was killed when his equipment overturned during night operations in Palo Colorado Canyon.

Coast residents east of Highway 1 were required to evacuate for short periods, and Highway 1 was shut down at intervals over several days to allow firefighters to conduct backfire operations. Visitors avoided the area and tourism revenue was impacted for several weeks.

In April, 2022, Ivan Gomez was convicted of 16 felony counts including arson for purposefully starting a fire near Lime Creek on August 18, 2020. The Dolan Fire killed a dozen Critically Endangered California Condors when it burned through the Big Sur Condor Sanctuary operated by the Ventana Wildlife Society of Monterey. The fire was not fully contained until December 31, more than four months after it started.

=== Effect on Redwoods===

In the lower elevations and canyons, the California Redwood is often found. Its thick bark, along with foliage that starts high above the ground, protect the species from both fire and insect damage, contributing to the coast redwood&#x27;s longevity. Fire appears to benefit redwoods by removing competitive species. A 2010 study compared post-wildfire survival and regeneration of redwood and associated species. It concluded that fires of all severity increase the relative abundance of redwood and higher-severity fires provide the greatest benefit.

== Climate ==

Big Sur typically enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate, with a sunny, dry summer and fall, and cool, wet winter. Coastal temperatures range from the 50s at night to the 70s by day (Fahrenheit) from June through October, and in the 40s to 60s from November through May. Further inland, away from the ocean&#x27;s moderating influence, temperatures are much more variable. The weather varies widely due to the influence of the jagged topography, creating many microclimates.
The record maximum temperature was on September 7, 2020, and the record low was , recorded on February 9, 2009.

During the winter, Big Sur experiences some of the heaviest rainfall in California. More than 70 percent of the rain falls from December through March. The summer is generally dry. The Santa Lucia range rises to more than 5,800  ft (1760 m), and the amount of rainfall greatly increases as the elevation rises and cools the air, but rainfall amounts decrease sharply in the rain shadow of the coastal mountains. Scientists estimate that about 90 in. (230  cm) falls on average near the ridge tops. But actual totals vary considerably. Snowfall is rare on the coast, but is common in the winter months on the higher ridges of the Santa Lucia Range.

Monterey County maintains a remote rain gauge for flood prediction on Mining Ridge at 4,000 ft (1200 m) about north-east of Cone Peak. The gauge frequently receives more rain than any gauge in the Monterey and San Francisco Bay Areas. The wettest winter season was 1982–1983, when it rained more than 178 in. (452 cm) but the total is unknown because the rain gauge failed at that point. The wettest calendar year on record was 1982–83, when it rained .

The month with the greatest rain fall total was December 1955 when it rained a record . At Pfeiffer–Big Sur State Park on the coast, rainfall averaged about 43 in. (109 cm) annually from 1914 to 1987. In 1975–1976, it rained only 15 in. (39 cm) at the park, compared to 85 in. (216 cm) in 1982–1983.


== Flora and fauna ==
The many climates of Big Sur result in great biodiversity, including many rare and endangered species such as the wild orchid &quot;Piperia yadonii&quot;, which is found only on the Monterey Peninsula and on Rocky Ridge in the Los Padres forest. Arid, dusty chaparral-covered hills exist within easy walking distance of lush riparian woodland. Fort Hunter-Liggett is host to about one-fourth of all Tule elk found in California and provides roosting places for bald eagles and endangered condors. It also is home to some of the healthiest stands of the live valley and blue oaks.

=== Southern limit of redwood trees ===

The high coastal mountains trap moisture from the clouds: fog in summer, rain, and snow in winter creating a favorable environment for the coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) trees found in the Big Sur region. They are found near the ocean in canyon bottoms or inland canyons alongside creeks and in other areas that meet its requirements for cooler temperatures and moisture. Due to drier conditions, trees in the Big Sur region only grow about tall, smaller than specimens found to the north.

The redwood trees in Big Sur are the remnant of much larger groves. Many old-growth trees were cut by the Ventana Power Company which operated a sawmill near present-day Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park from the late 1800s through 1906 when its operations were bankrupted by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. When John and Florence Pfeiffer opened Pfeiffer&#x27;s Ranch Resort in 1910, they built guest cabins from lumber cut using the mill. The mill was resurrected when Highway 1 was constructed during the 1920s. It supplied lumber for housing built for workers.

While many trees were harvested, several inaccessible locations were never logged. A large grove of trees is found along the north fork of the Little Sur River. William Randolph Hearst was interested in preserving the uncut redwood forest, and on November 18, 1921, he purchased about from the Eberhard and Kron Tanning Company of Santa Cruz for about $50,000. He later donated the land to the Monterey Bay Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, who completed the construction of Camp Pico Blanco in 1954.

In 2008, scientist J. Michael Fay published a map of the old growth redwoods based on his transect of the entire redwood range. The southernmost naturally occurring grove of redwoods is found within the Big Sur region in the Southern Redwood Botanical Area, a reserve located in the Little Redwood Gulch watershed adjacent to the Silver Peak Wilderness. It is just north of the Salmon Creek trailhead. The southernmost tree is about from Highway 1 at the approximate coordinates 

=== Plant species ===
The rare Santa Lucia fir (&quot;Abies bracteata&quot;) is found only in the Santa Lucia mountains. A common &quot;foreign&quot; species is the Monterey pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;), which was uncommon in Big Sur until the late nineteenth century, though its major native habitat is only a few miles upwind on the Monterey Peninsula when many homeowners began to plant the quick-growing tree as a windbreak. There are many broadleaved trees as well, such as the tanoak (&quot;Lithocarpus densiflorus&quot;), coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), and California bay laurel (&quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;). In the rain shadow, the forests disappear and the vegetation becomes open oak woodland, then transitions into the more familiar fire-tolerant California chaparral scrub.

=== Wildlife ===
The Big Sur River watershed provides habitat for mountain lion, deer, fox, coyotes, and non-native wild boars. The boars, of Russian stock, were introduced in the 1920s by George Gordon Moore, the owner of Rancho San Carlos. Because most of the upper reaches of the Big Sur River watershed are within the Los Padres National Forest and the Ventana Wilderness, much of the river is in pristine condition.

; Former Grizzly bear range
The region was historically populated by California grizzly bears. During the Spanish period of California history, the Spaniards rarely entered the area, except to capture runaway Mission Indians or to hunt grizzly bears that ate their livestock. The Mexican settlers captured bears for Monterey&#x27;s bear and bull fights and they also sold their skins for 6 to 10 pesos to trading ships that visited Monterey. Bear Trap Canyon near Bixby Creek was one of their favorite sites for trapping grizzly bears.

The California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus) was heavier and larger than grizzly bears found elsewhere in the continental United States. Malcolm Margolin in &quot;The Ohlone Way&quot; wrote that &quot;These enormous bears were everywhere, feeding on berries, lumbering along the beaches, congregating beneath oak trees during acorn season, and stationed along nearly every stream and creek during the annual runs of salmon and steelhead.&quot; Grizzly bears presented a serious threat to human beings armed with only a bow and arrows and the Native Americans used to avoid them whenever possible.

&quot;The Monterey Herald&quot; noted on July 4, 1874:

There are remnants of a grizzly bear trap within Palo Corona Regional Park east of Point Lobos in a grove of redwood trees next to a creek.

European settlers paid bounties on the bears who regularly preyed on livestock until the early 20th century. Absolom (Rocky) Beasley hunted grizzly bears throughout the Santa Lucia Range and claimed to have killed 139 bears in his lifetime. The Pfeiffer family would fill a bait ball of swine entrails with strychnine and hang it from a tree. They wrote that the last grizzly bear was seen in Monterey County in 1941 on the Cooper Ranch near the mouth of the Little Sur River. Other sources report that last California grizzly was seen in 1924.

Since about 1980, American black bears have been sighted in the area, likely expanding their range from southern California and filling in the ecological niche left when the grizzly bear was exterminated.

; Steelhead
The California Department of Fish and Game says the Little Sur River is the &quot;most important spawning stream for Steelhead&quot; distinct population segment on the Central Coast, where the fish is listed as threatened. and that it &quot;is one of the best steelhead streams in the county.&quot; The Big Sur River is also a key habitat for the steelhead.

A US fisheries service report estimates that the number of trout in the entire south-central coast area—including the Pajaro River, Salinas River, Carmel River, Big Sur River, and Little Sur River—have dwindled from about 4,750 fish in 1965 to about 800 in 2005.

Numerous fauna are found in the Big Sur region. Among amphibians the California giant salamander (&quot;Dicamptodon ensatus&quot;) is found here, which point marks the southern extent of its range.

; California condor
The California condor (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;) is a critically endangered species that was near extinction when the remaining wild birds were captured. A captive breeding program was begun in 1987. The Ventana Wildlife Society acquired 80 acres near Anderson Canyon that it used for a captive breeding program. After some success, a few birds were released in 1991 and 1992 in Big Sur, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.

In 1997, the Ventana Wildlife Society began releasing captive-bred California Condors in Big Sur. The birds take six years to mature before they can produce offspring, and a nest was discovered in a redwood tree in 2006. This was the first time in more than 100 years in which a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California. The repopulation effort has been successful in part because a significant portion of the birds&#x27; diet includes carcasses of large sea creatures that have washed ashore, which are unlikely to be contaminated with lead, the principal cause of the bird&#x27;s mortality.

, the Ventana Wildlife Society managed 34 free-flying condors. There were part of a total population of 437 condors spread over California, Baja California and Arizona, of which 232 are wild birds and 205 are in captivity.

=== Marine protected areas ===

The off-shore region of the Big Sur Coast is protected by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Within that sanctuary are other conservation areas and parks. The onshore topography that drops abruptly into the Pacific continues offshore where a narrow continental shelf drops to the continental slope in only a few miles. The ocean reaches a depth of more than just offshore. Two deep submarine canyons cut into the shelf near the Big Sur coast: the Sur Submarine Canyon, reaching a depth of just south of Point Sur, and Partington Submarine Canyon, which reaches a similar depth of offshore of Grimes Canyon.

Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

== Demographics ==

Big Sur is sparsely populated. There are about 1,800 to 2,000 year-round residents, only a few hundred more residents than found there in 1900. Big Sur residents include descendants of the original ranching families, artists, writers, service staff, along with homeowners. The mountainous terrain, restrictions imposed by the Big Sur Coastal Use Plan, limited availability of property that can be developed, and the expense required to build on available land has kept Big Sur relatively undeveloped. According to the Big Sur Chamber of Commerce, about half the businesses derive their income from the hospitality industry, and they in turn produce about 90 percent of the local economy.

=== Population data ===
The United States does not define a census-designated place called Big Sur, but it does define a census tract (115) that includes almost all of the Big Sur coast, beginning in the north at Malpaso Creek and ending south of Lucia. It does not include New Camoldi Hermitage, Gorda, and Ragged Point where a few dozen people live, and it does not include the isolated private inholdings within the Los Padres National Forest. It includes much of the interior coast as far west as the Tassajara Zen Center.

In 1977, there were 1,813 residents and 846 dwelling units. In 2018, the Census Bureau estimated there were 1,728 residents, (1,125 white, 525 Latino or Hispanic), 892 housing units, 639 households, 253 vacant or rental housing units; the median value of owner-occupied housing units was $877,100. Per capita income was $34,845; median income $63,843; mean income $81,766.

The racial makeup of this area was 87.6% White, 1.1% African American, 1.3% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 5.5% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 9.6% of the population. In the 93920 ZCTA, the population age was widely distributed, with 20.2% under the age of 20, 4.5% from 20 to 24, 26.9% from 25 to 44, 37.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.2 years. The median income in 2000 for a household in 93920 ZCTA was $41,304, and the median income for a family was $65,083.

== Fire protection==

Two local volunteer fire departments provide emergency services in the region. CalFire&#x27;s nearest station is located in Carmel north of Big Sur Village. The United States Forest Service&#x27;s Nacimiento Ranger Station is located on Nacimiento-Fergusson Road from the coast highway. It was destroyed by the arson-set Dolan Fire on September 8, 2020, and is to be rebuilt.

During winter storms following the 2020 Dolan Fire, entire sections of the Nacimiento-Fergusson Road were washed away, and it has remained closed since then. In January 2022, U.S. Representative Jimmy Panetta announced that he had obtained $126 million in Federal Highway Administration funds to repair the road and rebuild the USFS Nacimiento Ranger Station destroyed in the blaze. This includes replacing the fire station, barracks, engine garage and pumphouse, along with some site utilities, such as a water well, solar connections and access roads.

Due to the remoteness of the region, it may take first responders more than one hour to respond to an emergency event. Following initial response and depending on the location, the nearest hospital is up to an hour away. In critical cases, patients can be flown out by air ambulance depending on their injuries and weather conditions.

The volunteer Mid Coast Fire Brigade located on Palo Colorado Road was organized in June, 1979. Residents raised $300,000 to build a firehouse. Members receive training in CPR, defibrillation, rope rescue, vehicle extrication, water rescue as well as structural, vehicle and wildland firefighting skills. , there were about 300 households in the Palo Colorado Canyon area.

The volunteer Big Sur Fire Brigade was founded by Gary Koeppel on August 1, 1974. He persuaded Walter Trotter, a member of a pioneer Big Sur family, to become the first fire chief. Trotter was enormously well-known and influential, and he very quickly appointed a number of volunteers. The brigade provides emergency response from mile marker 58.3 north of the Little Sur River bridge on Highway 1 to the San Luis Obispo County Line. The department has two stations. Station 1 is located south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park at the Post Ranch. Station 2 is located near Gorda.

== Education==

Two schools are available to students in Big Sur. To the north, the Captain Cooper School serves 52 students from grades K-5 who live in the vicinity of Palo Colorado Canyon, Big Sur Village, Posts, and Slates Hot Springs. The land for the school was donated in 1962 by Frances Molera. She stipulated that it be named after her pioneer grandfather, Juan B. R. Cooper, who bought Rancho El Sur in 1840. The school was built by community members without assistance from the Carmel Unified School District, who assumed management of the school once it was complete. Older students take a bus to Carmel schools.

To the south, the Pacific Valley School was founded by the Plaskett family in 1880. It serves 22 students in grades K–12 in the areas near Plaskett, Lucia, and Gorda. Closed repeatedly due to low or no enrollment, it reopened in the 1950s. Pacific Valley School is one of two schools in the Big Sur Unified School District. It has a 3:1 student/teacher ratio. They engage in collaborative learning between age groups.

== Government ==
At the county level, Big Sur is represented on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors by Mary Adams. In the California State Assembly, Big Sur is in , and in . In the United States House of Representatives, Big Sur is in .

== In popular culture ==
=== In literature ===

In 1964, Ballantine Books published &quot;Dark Dominion&quot;, a science-fiction novel by David Duncan describing a Magellan Project to build a spaceship called the Black Planet. Construction is located at Big Sur. The narrator and others take various trips around the region and the novel describes the area in some detail, including caves.

In 1962, famous Beat author Jack Kerouac released the novel &quot;Big Sur&quot;, which prominently features the location throughout the narrative. It became one of Kerouac&#x27;s most prolific works.

In 1995, prominent environmentalist David Brower published &quot;Not Man Apart: Photographs of the Big Sur Coast&quot;, featuring Robinson Jeffers&#x27; poetry and photography of the Big Sur coast. In the posthumously published 2002 book &quot;Stones of the Sur&quot;, Carmel landscape photographer Morley Baer combined his classical black-and-white photographs of Big Sur with some of Jeffers&#x27;s poetry.

=== In film ===
A number of well-known films are set in Big Sur, including &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; (1965), starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Eva Marie Saint and Charles Bronson. The 1974 film &quot;Zandy&#x27;s Bride&quot;, starring Gene Hackman and Liv Ullmann, was also based in the region. In 2013, Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;Big Sur&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Kate Bosworth and directed by the actress&#x27; husband, Michael Polish. , 19 movies had been filmed in the Big Sur region, beginning with &quot;Suspicion&quot; in 1941.

=== In music ===
&quot;California Saga: California&quot; and “California Saga: Big Sur”(1973), songs on The Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Holland&quot;, depicts the rugged wilderness in the area and the culture of its inhabitants.

&quot;Going Back to Big Sur&quot; was written by Johnny Rivers, who sang it on his 1968 album &quot;Realization.&quot; The closing stanzas: &quot;Guess I&#x27;ll drive up Highway One / Did the ocean kiss the setting sun? / The stars dancing in the sky / Sort of puts you on a natural high
Going back to Big Sur / This time, I might just stay /I&#x27;m going back and straighten out my head /Just south of Monterey / And that girl.&quot;

The song &quot;Big Sur Moon&quot; from Buckethead&#x27;s album Colma is named after the area.

The song &quot;Bixby Canyon Bridge&quot; from Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s album &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot; explores the narrator&#x27;s visit to Big Sur, waiting for an epiphany that never comes.

&quot;The Dharma at Big Sur&quot;, by John Adams, for electric violin and orchestra, was composed in 2003 for the opening of Disney Hall in Los Angeles.

Alanis Morissette released the song &quot;Big Sur&quot; as her &quot;ode to Big Sur with all its majesty&quot; as exclusive bonus track on the Target edition of her 2012 Havoc and Bright Lights album. The song was released as single in 2014.

&quot;Big Sur&quot; is the third single released by Irish band the Thrills, taken from their debut album, &quot;So Much for the City&quot; (2003).

&quot;Road Trippin’&quot;, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Californication&quot;, evokes the experience of a road trip through Big Sur.

The Big Sur Folk Festival was held annually in the region from 1964-1971. A documentary film of the 1969 concert was produced titled Celebration at Big Sur. 

=== In computing ===
Apple&#x27;s desktop operating system, macOS Big Sur, announced on June 22, 2020, during WWDC, is named after this region.

<text>Gang Hong-rip (; 1560 – 6 September 1627) was a Korean general during the Joseon period.

Under repeated requests from Ming China, Gwanghaegun commanded Gang Hongrip to help Ming forces with ten thousand soldiers against the Manchus in 1619. However, Ming armies were crushed in the Battle of Sarhū. The Korean army under command of Liu Ting lost two-thirds of his troops at Fuca and surrendered to Nurhaci. Official Korean records say that Gwanghaegun had ordered a betrayal to Nurhaci, but it is suspected to be a defamation by the Westerners faction, who deposed the king. In 1620 almost all Korean captives were released but Gang Hongrip, who had good command of the Manchu language, was still kept.

Frustrated with unsatisfactory reward for the coup which deposed Gwanghaegun, Yi Gwal rebelled against King Injo in 1624. He temporarily occupied Hanseong (modern-day Seoul), but was eventually crushed. Yi Gwal was then executed by his own soldiers. Han Myeong-nyeon, an accomplice of Yi Gwal, was also killed, but his son Han Yun fled to the Later Jin (Manchus).

Gang Hongrip fell for Han Yun&#x27;s trick and wrongly believed that his family was all killed by the Joseon government. To get his revenge on Korea, he urged the Manchus to defeat the Joseon dynasty. In 1627 he guided the Later Jin army led by Amin to Hanseong and as a Manchu delegate he negotiated for a truce with Korea. Then he discovered that he was deceived about his family being killed and suffered a heartbreak. He was branded as a traitor and deprived of his official rank. He was rehabilitated after his death.

<doc id="240899" wikidata="Q1547173" url="?curid=240899" title="Axillary nerve">
<text>The axillary nerve or the circumflex nerve is a nerve of the human body, that originates from the brachial plexus (upper trunk, posterior division, posterior cord) at the level of the axilla (armpit) and carries nerve fibers from C5 and C6. The axillary nerve travels through the quadrangular space with the posterior circumflex humeral artery and vein to innervate the deltoid and teres minor.

==Structure==
The nerve lies at first behind the axillary artery, and in front of the subscapularis, and passes downward to the lower border of that muscle.

It then winds from anterior to posterior around the neck of the humerus, in company with the posterior humeral circumflex artery, through the quadrangular space (bounded above by the teres minor, below by the teres major, medially by the long head of the triceps brachii, and laterally by the surgical neck of the humerus), and divides into an anterior, a posterior, and a collateral branch to the long head of the triceps brachii branch.

* The &quot;anterior branch&quot; (upper branch) winds around the surgical neck of the humerus, beneath the deltoid muscle, with the posterior humeral circumflex vessels. It continues as far as the anterior border of the deltoid to provide motor innervation. The anterior branch also gives off a few small cutaneous branches, which pierce the muscle and supply in the overlaying skin.
* The &quot;posterior branch&quot; (lower branch) supplies the teres minor and the posterior part of the deltoid. The posterior branch pierces the deep fascia and continues as the superior (or upper) lateral cutaneous nerve of arm, which sweeps around the posterior border of the deltoid and supplies the skin over the lower two-thirds of the posterior part of this muscle, as well as that covering the long head of the triceps brachii.
* The motor branch of the long head of the triceps brachii arises, on average, a distance of 6 mm (range 2–12 mm) from the terminal division of the posterior cord termination.
* The trunk of the axillary nerve gives off an articular filament which enters the shoulder joint below the subscapularis.

===Variation===
Traditionally, the axillary nerve is thought to only supply the deltoid and teres minor. However, several studies on cadavers pointed out that the long head of triceps brachii is innervated by a branch of the axillary nerve.

==Function==
The axillary nerve supplies two muscles in the arm: deltoid (a muscle of the shoulder) and teres minor (one of the rotator cuff muscles). 
The axillary nerve also carries sensory information from the shoulder joint. It also innervates the skin, covering the inferior region of the deltoid muscle, known as the regimental badge area. This is innervated by the superior lateral cutaneous nerve branch of the axillary nerve.

The posterior cord of the brachial plexus splits inferiorly to the glenohumeral joint giving rise to the axillary nerve which wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus, and the radial nerve which wraps around the humerus anteriorly and descends along its lateral border.

==Clinical significance==
The axillary nerve may be injured in anterior-inferior dislocations of the shoulder joint, compression of the axilla with a crutch or fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. An example of injury to the axillary nerve includes axillary nerve palsy. Injury to the nerve results in:

*Paralysis of the teres minor muscle and deltoid muscle, resulting in loss of abduction of arm (from 15-90 degrees), weak flexion, extension, and rotation of shoulder. Paralysis of deltoid and teres minor muscles results in flat shoulder deformity.
*Loss of sensation in the skin over the regimental badge area.
Direct trauma to the nerve can also lead to paralysis and loss of sensation.

<doc id="240900" wikidata="Q471779" url="?curid=240900" title="World War II casualties">
<text>World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history. An estimated total of 70–85 million deaths were caused by the conflict, representing about 3% of the estimated global population of 2.3 billion in 1940. Deaths directly caused by the war (including military and civilian fatalities) are estimated at 50–56 million, with an additional estimated 19–28 million deaths from war-related disease and famine. Civilian deaths totaled 50–55 million. Military deaths from all causes totaled 21–25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war. More than half of the total number of casualties are accounted for by the dead of the Republic of China and of the Soviet Union. The following tables give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses. Statistics on the number of military wounded are included whenever available.

Recent historical scholarship has shed new light on the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet World War II fatalities. According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million, including 8 to 9 million due to famine and disease. In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland&#x27;s dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million. Historian Rüdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 estimating the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany&#x27;s 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe. The Red Army claimed responsibility for the majority of Wehrmacht casualties during World War II. The People&#x27;s Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million, while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million. An estimated 7–10 million people died in the Dutch, British, French and US colonies in South and Southeast Asia, mostly from war-related famine.

==Classification of casualties==

Compiling or estimating the numbers of deaths and wounded caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed and wounded during World War II. The authors of the &quot;Oxford Companion to World War II&quot; maintain that &quot;casualty statistics are notoriously unreliable&quot;. The table below gives data on the number of dead and military wounded for each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, German war crimes, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, Allied war crimes, and deaths due to war-related famine and disease.

The sources for the casualties of the individual countries do not use the same methods, and civilian deaths due to starvation and disease make up a large proportion of the civilian deaths in China and the Soviet Union. The losses listed here are actual deaths; hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear-cut. For states that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war-related famine. The casualties listed here include 19 to 25 million war-related famine deaths in the USSR, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.

The footnotes give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources, including data on the number of wounded where reliable sources are available.

==Human losses by country==
===Total deaths by country===
* Figures are rounded to the nearest hundredth place.
* Military casualties include deaths of regular military forces from combat as well as non-combat causes. Partisan and resistance fighter deaths are included with military losses. The deaths of prisoners of war in captivity and personnel missing in action are also included with military deaths. Whenever possible the details are given in the footnotes.
* The armed forces of the various states are treated as single entities, for example the deaths of Austrians, French and foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe in the Wehrmacht are included with German military losses. For example, Michael Strank is included in the American, not Czechoslovak, war dead total.
** The bare minimum amount of military deaths from all causes is 21,124,905.
* Civilian war dead are included with the territories where they resided. For example, German Jewish refugees in France who were deported to the death camps are included with French casualties in the published sources on the Holocaust.
* The official casualty statistics published by the governments of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom do not give the details of the national origin, ethnic background, and religion of the losses.
* Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, German war crimes, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, Allied war crimes, and deaths due to war related famine and disease. The exact breakdown is not always provided in the sources cited.

===Soviet Union===

The estimated breakdown for each Soviet republic of total war dead

The source of the figures is . Erlikman, a Russian historian, notes that these figures are his estimates.
* The population listed here of 194.090 million is taken from Soviet era sources. Recent studies published in Russia put the actual corrected population in 1940 at 192.598 million.
* According to Russian estimates the population in 1939 included 20.268 million in the territories annexed by the USSR from 1939 to 1940: the eastern regions of Poland 12.983 million; Lithuania 2.440 million; Latvia 1.951 million; Estonia 1.122 million; Romanian Bessarabia and Bukovina 3.7 million; less transfers out of (392,000) ethnic Germans deported during the Nazi–Soviet population transfers; the Anders Army (120,000); the First Polish Army (1944–45) (26,000) and Zakerzonia &amp; the Belastok Region (1,392,000) which was returned to Poland in 1945.
* Russian sources estimate post-war population transfers resulted in a net loss of (622,000). The additions were the annexation of the Carpatho-Ukraine 725,000; the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic 81,000; the remaining population on South Sakhalin 29,000 and in the Kaliningrad Oblast 5,000; and the deportation of Ukrainians from Poland to the USSR in 1944–47 518,000. The transfers out included the flight and expulsion of Poles from the USSR 1944–47 (1,529,000) and the post-war emigration to the west (451,000) According to Viktor Zemskov, 3/4 of the post-war emigration to the west was of persons who were from the territories annexed in 1939–40.
* Estimates in the west for the population transfers differ. According to Sergei Maksudov, a Russian demographer living in the west, the population of the territories annexed by the USSR was 23 million less the net population transfers out of 3 million persons who emigrated from the USSR including 2,136,000 Poles who left the USSR; 115,000 Polish soldiers of the Anders Army; 392,000 Germans who left in the era of the Nazi-Soviet Pact and 400,000 Jews, Romanians, Germans Czech and Hungarians who emigrated after the war The Polish government-in-exile put the population of the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union at 13.199 million.
* Polish sources put the number of refugees from the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union living in post war Poland at about 2.2 million, about 700,000 more than those listed in the Soviet sources of Poles repatriated. The difference is due to the fact that Poles from the eastern regions who were deported to Germany during the war or had fled Volhynia and Eastern Galicia were not included in the figures of the organized transfers in 1944–47.
* Figures for Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania include about two million civilian dead that are also listed in Polish sources in the total war dead of Poland. Polish historian Krystyna Kersten estimated losses of about two million in the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The formal transfer of the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union occurred with the Polish–Soviet border agreement of August 1945.
* According to Erlikman, in addition to the war dead, there were 1,700,000 deaths due to Soviet repression (200,000 executed; 4,500,000 sent to prisons and Gulag of whom 1,200,000 died; 2,200,000 deported of whom 300,000 died).

===Nazi Germany===
* German sources do not provide figures for Soviet citizens conscripted by Germany. Russian historian Grigoriy Krivosheyev puts the losses of the &quot;Vlasovites, Balts and Muslims etc.&quot; in German service at 215,000.

===United States===

==== Estimated breakdown for each US state and territory of total war dead ====
This table displays the number of people who are believed to have died in the United States by state and territory. This list includes those who died at sea.
=== Japanese Empire ===

===Holocaust deaths===
Included in the figures of total war dead for each country are victims of the Holocaust.

====Jewish deaths====
The Holocaust is the term generally used to describe the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II. Martin Gilbert estimates 5.7 million (78%) of the 7.3 million Jews in German-occupied Europe were Holocaust victims. Estimates of Holocaust deaths range between 4.9 and 5.9 million Jews.

; Statistical breakdown of Jewish dead:
* In Nazi extermination camps: according to Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers, 2,830,000 Jews were murdered in the Nazi death camps (500,000 Belzec; 150,000 Sobibor; 850,000 Treblinka; 150,000 Chełmno; 1,100,000 Auschwitz; 80,000 Majdanek). Raul Hilberg puts the Jewish death toll in the death camps, including Romanian Transnistria, at 3.0 million.
* In the USSR by the Einsatzgruppen: Raul Hilberg puts the Jewish death toll in the area of the mobile killing groups at 1.4 million.
* Aggravated deaths in the Ghettos of Nazi-occupied Europe: Raul Hilberg puts the Jewish death toll in the Ghettos at 700,000.
* Yad Vashem estimated that, in early 2019, its Central Database of Shoah Victims&#x27; Names contained the names of 4.8 million Jewish Holocaust dead.

The figures for the pre-war Jewish population and deaths in the table below are from &quot;The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust&quot;. The low, high and average percentage figures for deaths of the pre-war population have been added.

* The total population figures from 1933 listed here are taken from &quot;The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust&quot;. From 1933 to 1939 about 400,000 Jews fled Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. Some of these refugees were in western Europe when Germany occupied these countries in 1940. In 1940 there were 30,000 Jewish refugees in the Netherlands, 12,000 in Belgium, 30,000 in France, 2,000 in Denmark, 5,000 in Italy, and 2,000 in Norway.
*Hungarian Jewish losses of 569,000 presented here include the territories annexed in 1939–41. The number of Holocaust dead in 1938 Hungarian borders were 220,000. According to Martin Gilbert, the Jewish population inside Hungary&#x27;s 1941 borders was 764,000 (445,000 in the 1938 borders and 319,000 in the annexed territories). Holocaust deaths from inside the 1938 borders was 200,000, not including 20,000 men conscripted as forced labor for the military.
*Netherlands figure listed in the table of 112,000 Jews taken from &quot;The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust&quot; includes those Jews who were resident in Holland in 1933. By 1940, the Jewish population had increased to 140,000 with the inclusion of 30,000 Jewish refugees. In the Netherlands, 8,000 Jews in mixed marriages were not subject to deportation. However, an article in the Dutch periodical &quot;De Groene Amsterdammer&quot; maintains that some Jews in mixed marriages were deported before the practice was ended by Hitler.
* Hungarian Jewish Holocaust victims within the 1939 borders were 200,000.
* Romanian Jewish Holocaust victims totalled 469,000 within the 1939 borders, which includes 300,000 in Bessarabia and Bukovina occupied by the USSR in 1940.
* According to Martin Gilbert, Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 8,000 in Italy, and 562 in the Italian colony of Libya.

====Non-Jews persecuted and killed by Nazi and Nazi-affiliated forces====
Some scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the other victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis.
* Donald L. Niewyk, professor of history at Southern Methodist University, maintains that the Holocaust can be defined in four ways: first, that it was the genocide of the Jews alone; second, that there were several parallel Holocausts, one for each of the several groups; third, the Holocaust would include Roma and the handicapped along with the Jews; fourth, it would include all racially motivated German crimes, such as the murder of Soviet prisoners of war, Polish and Soviet civilians, as well as political prisoners, religious dissenters, and homosexuals. Using this definition, the total number of Holocaust victims is between 11 million and 17 million people.
* According to the College of Education of the University of South Florida &quot;Approximately 11 million people were killed because of Nazi genocidal policy&quot;.
* R.J. Rummel estimated the death toll due to Nazi Democide at 20.9 million persons.
* Timothy Snyder put the number of victims of the Nazis killed as a result of &quot;deliberate policies of mass murder&quot; only, such as executions, deliberate famine and in death camps, at 10.4 million persons including 5.4 million Jews.
* German scholar Hellmuth Auerbach puts the death toll in the Hitler era at 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and 7 million other victims of the Nazis.
* Dieter Pohl puts the total number of victims of the Nazi era at between 12 and 14 million persons, including 5.6–5.7 million Jews.
* Roma Included in the figures of total war dead are the Roma victims of the Nazi persecution; some scholars include the Roma deaths with the Holocaust. Most estimates of Roma (Gypsies) victims range from 130,000 to 500,000. Ian Hancock, Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, has argued in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Roma dead. Hancock writes that, proportionately, the death toll equaled &quot;and almost certainly exceed[ed], that of Jewish victims&quot;. In a 2010 publication, Ian Hancock stated that he agrees with the view that the number of Romanis killed has been underestimated as a result of being grouped with others in Nazi records under headings such as &quot;remainder to be liquidated&quot;, &quot;hangers-on&quot; and &quot;partisans&quot;.
* In 2018, the United States Holocaust museum has the number of murdered during the time period of the holocaust at 17 million6 million Jews and 11 million others.

The following figures are from &quot;The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust&quot;, the authors maintain that &quot;statistics on Gypsy losses are especially unreliable and controversial. These figures (cited below) are based on necessarily rough estimates&quot;.

* Handicapped persons: 200,000 to 250,000 handicapped persons were killed. A 2003 report by the German Federal Archive put the total murdered during the Action T4 and Action 14f13 programs at 200,000.
* Prisoners of War: POW deaths in Nazi captivity totalled 3.1 million including 2.6 to 3.0 million Soviet prisoners of war.
* Ethnic Poles: According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum &quot;It is estimated that the Germans killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians during World War II.&quot; They maintain that &quot;Documentation remains fragmentary, but today scholars of independent Poland believe that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians (non-Jews) were victims of German Occupation policies and the war.&quot; However, the Polish government affiliated Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) in 2009 estimated 2,770,000 ethnic Polish deaths due to the German occupation (see World War II casualties of Poland).
* Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians: According to Nazi ideology, Slavs were useless sub-humans. As such, their leaders, the Soviet elite, were to be killed and the remainder of the population enslaved, starved to death, or expelled further eastward. As a result, millions of civilians in the Soviet Union were deliberately killed, starved, or worked to death. Contemporary Russian sources use the terms &quot;genocide&quot; and &quot;premeditated extermination&quot; when referring to civilian losses in the occupied USSR. Civilians killed in reprisals during the Soviet partisan war and wartime-related famine account for a major part of the huge toll. The &quot;Cambridge History of Russia&quot; puts overall civilian deaths in the Nazi-occupied USSR at 13.7 million persons including 2 million Jews. There were an additional 2.6 million deaths in the interior regions of the Soviet Union. The authors maintain &quot;scope for error in this number is very wide&quot;. At least 1 million perished in the wartime GULAG camps or in deportations. Other deaths occurred in the wartime evacuations and due to war related malnutrition and disease in the interior. The authors maintain that both Stalin and Hitler &quot;were both responsible but in different ways for these deaths&quot;, and &quot;In short the general picture of Soviet wartime losses suggests a jigsaw puzzle. The general outline is clear: people died in colossal numbers but in many different miserable and terrible circumstances. But individual pieces of the puzzle do not fit well; some overlap and others are yet to be found&quot;. Bohdan Wytwycky maintained that civilian losses of 3.0 million Ukrainians and 1.4 million Belarusians &quot;were racially motivated&quot;. According to Paul Robert Magocsi, between 1941 and 1945, approximately 3,000,000 Ukrainian and other non-Jewish victims were killed as part of Nazi extermination policies in the territory of modern Ukraine. Dieter Pohl puts the total number of victims of the Nazi policies in the USSR at 500,000 civilians killed in the repression of partisans, 1.0 million victims of the Nazi Hunger Plan, c. 3.0 million Soviet POW and 1.0 million Jews (in pre-war borders). Soviet author Georgiy A. Kumanev put the civilian death toll in the Nazi-occupied USSR at 8.2 million (4.0 million Ukrainians, 2.5 million Belarusians, and 1.7 million Russians). A report published by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1995 put the death toll due to the German occupation at 13.7 million civilians (including Jews): 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million persons deported to Germany for forced labor; and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths in occupied territory. Sources published in the Soviet Union were cited to support these figures.
* Homosexuals: According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum &quot;Between 1933 and 1945 the police arrested an estimated 100,000 men as homosexuals. Most of the 50,000 men sentenced by the courts spent time in regular prisons, and between 5,000 and 15,000 were interned in concentration camps.&quot; They also noted that there are no known statistics for the number of homosexuals who died in the camps.
* Other victims of Nazi persecution: Between 1,000 and 2,000 Roman Catholic clergy, about 1,000 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and an unknown number of Freemasons perished in Nazi prisons and camps. &quot;The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder.&quot; During the Nazi era Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats, and trade union leaders were victims of Nazi persecution.
* Serbs: The numbers of Serbs murdered by the Ustaše is the subject of debate and estimates vary widely. Yad Vashem estimates over 500,000 murdered, 250,000 expelled and 200,000 forcibly converted to Catholicism. The estimate of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is that the Ustaše murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia between 1941 and 1945, with roughly 45,000 to 52,000 murdered at the Jasenovac concentration camp alone. According to the Wiesenthal Center at least 90,000 Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and anti-fascist Croatians perished at the hands of the Ustashe at the camp at Jasenovac. According to Yugoslav sources published in the Tito era the estimates of the number of Serb victims range from 200,000 to at least 600,000 persons. See also World War II persecution of Serbs.

===German war crimes===


Nazi Germany ordered, organized and condoned a substantial number of war crimes in World War II. The most notable of these is the Holocaust in which millions of Jews, Poles, and Romani were systematically murdered or died from abuse and mistreatment. Millions also died as a result of other German actions.

While the Nazi Party&#x27;s own SS forces (in particular the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot;, &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; and Waffen-SS) of Nazi Germany was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of the Holocaust, the regular armed forces represented by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; committed war crimes of their own, particularly on the Eastern Front in the war against the Soviet Union.

===Japanese war crimes===

Included with total war dead are victims of Japanese war crimes.

===Oppression in the Soviet Union===

The total war dead in the USSR includes about 1 million victims of Stalin&#x27;s regime. The number of deaths in the Gulag labor camps increased as a result of wartime overcrowding and food shortages. The Stalin regime deported the entire populations of ethnic minorities considered to be potentially disloyal. Since 1990 Russian scholars have been given access to the Soviet-era archives and have published data on the numbers of people executed and those who died in Gulag labor camps and prisons. The Russian scholar Viktor Zemskov puts the death toll from 1941 to 1945 at about 1 million based on data from the Soviet archives. The Soviet-era archive figures on the Gulag labor camps has been the subject of a vigorous academic debate outside Russia since their publication in 1991. J. Arch Getty and Stephen G. Wheatcroft maintain that Soviet-era figures more accurately detail the victims of the Gulag labor camp system in the Stalin era. Robert Conquest and Steven Rosefielde have disputed the accuracy of the data from the Soviet archives, maintaining that the demographic data and testimonials by survivors of the Gulag labor camps indicate a higher death toll. Rosefielde posits that the release of the Soviet Archive figures is disinformation generated by the modern KGB. Rosefielde maintains that the data from the Soviet archives is incomplete; for example, he pointed out that the figures do not include the 22,000 victims of the Katyn massacre. Rosefielde&#x27;s demographic analysis puts the number of excess deaths due to Soviet repression at 2,183,000 in 1939–40 and 5,458,000 from 1941 to 1945. Michael Haynes and Rumy Husun accept the figures from the Soviet archives as being an accurate tally of Stalin&#x27;s victims, they maintain that the demographic data depicts an underdeveloped Soviet economy and the losses in World War Two rather than indicating a higher death toll in the Gulag labor camps.

In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation. Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets. In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000.

The Estonian State Commission for the Examination of Repressive Policies Carried out During the Occupations put civilian deaths due to the Soviet occupation in 1940–1941 at 33,900 including (7,800 deaths) of arrested people, (6,000) deportee deaths, (5,000) evacuee deaths, (1,100) people gone missing and (14,000) conscripted for forced labor. After the reoccupation by the USSR, 5,000 Estonians died in Soviet prisons during 1944–45.

The following is a summary of the data from the Soviet archives:
Reported deaths for the years 1939–1945 1,187,783, including: judicial executions 46,350; deaths in Gulag labor camps 718,804; deaths in labor colonies and prisons 422,629.

Deported to special settlements: (figures are for deportations to Special Settlements only, not including those executed, sent to Gulag labor camps or conscripted into the Soviet Army. Nor do the figures include additional deportations after the war).
Deported from annexed territories 1940–41 380,000 to 390,000 persons, including: Poland 309–312,000; Lithuania 17,500; Latvia 17,000; Estonia 6,000; Moldova 22,842. In August 1941, 243,106 Poles living in the Special Settlements were amnestied and released by the Soviets.
Deported during the War 1941–1945 about 2.3 million persons of Soviet ethnic minorities including: Soviet Germans 1,209,000; Finns 9,000; Karachays 69,000; Kalmyks 92,000; Chechens and Ingush 479,000; Balkars 37,000; Crimean Tatars 191,014; Meskhetian Turks 91,000; Greeks, Bulgarians and Armenians from Crimea 42,000; Ukrainian OUN members 100,000; Poles 30,000.

A total of 2,230,500 persons were living in the settlements in October 1945 and 309,100 deaths were reported in special settlements for the years 1941–1948.

Russian sources list Axis prisoner of war deaths of 580,589 in Soviet captivity based on data in the Soviet archives (Germany 381,067; Hungary 54,755; Romania 54,612; Italy 27,683; Finland 403, and Japan 62,069). However, some western scholars estimate the total at between 1.7 and 2.3 million.

POW deaths includes 266,000 in the post-war period after June 1945, primarily in Soviet captivity.
# Rüdiger Overmans writes &quot;It seems entirely plausible, while not provable, that one half of the 1.5 million missing on the eastern front were killed in action, the other half (700,000) having died in Soviet custody&quot;.
# Soviet sources list the deaths of 474,967 of the 2,652,672 German Armed Forces POW taken in the war.

===Commonwealth military casualties===
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) Annual Report 2014–2015 is the source of the military dead for the British Empire. The war dead totals listed in the report are based on the research by the CWGC to identify and commemorate Commonwealth war dead. The statistics tabulated by the CWGC are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth and former UK Dependencies, whose death was attributable to their war service. Some auxiliary and civilian organizations are also accorded war grave status if death occurred under certain specified conditions. For the purposes of CWGC the dates of inclusion for Commonwealth War Dead are 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947.

　China
Sources for total Chinese war dead are divergent and range from 10 to 20 million as detailed below.
* John W. Dower has noted &quot;So great was the devastation and suffering in China that in the end it is necessary to speak of uncertain &quot;millions&quot; of deaths. Certainly, it is reasonable to think in general terms of approximately 10 million Chinese war dead, a total surpassed only by the Soviet Union.&quot; Dower cited a United Nations report from 1947 that put Chinese war dead at 9 million.
* According to Rana Mitter &quot;the death toll on China is still being calculated, but conservative estimates number the dead at 14 million&quot;. Rana Mitter cited the estimate of Chinese casualties by Odd Arne Westad of 2 million combat deaths and 12 million civilian deaths, Mitter also cited a Chinese study published in 2006 that put the death toll in the war at 8 to 10 million.
* An academic study of the Chinese population concluded that &quot;a conservative estimate would put total human casualties directly caused by the war of 1937–1945 at between 15,000,000 and 20,000,000&quot;.

It also includes foreign volunteers who died during their service in Finland and Finnish SS-men who died while serving in the German army. The database contains civilians in case they have been buried at a military cemetery.

　Germany
The following notes summarize German casualties, the details are presented in German casualties in World War II.

German population
* The 1939 Population for Germany within 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png was 69.3 million persons.
* Foreign nationals of German ancestry in the countries of East-Central Europe were subject to conscription by Nazi Germany during the war. According to a 1958 report by the West German Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office) the pre war ethnic German population in eastern Europe was 7,423,300 persons (249,500 Baltic states &amp; Memel; 380,000 Danzig; 1,371,000 Poland (1939 Borders) File:Rzeczpospolita 1923.png - Wikimedia Commons; 3,477,000 Czechoslovakia; 623,000 Hungary; 536,800 Yugoslavia; and 786,000 Romania). These German estimates are disputed. A recent analysis by a Polish scholar found that &quot;Generally speaking, the German estimates... are not only highly arbitrary, but also clearly tendentious in presentation of the German losses&quot;. He maintains that the German government figures from 1958 overstated the total number of the ethnic Germans living in Poland prior to war as well as the total civilian deaths due to the post war expulsions.

Total German war dead
* (1949) The West German Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office)estimated total war dead of 5,483,000; (3,250,000)military; (500,000) civilians killed in bombing raids and the land campaign; (1,533,000) deaths in the expulsions from Poland and (200,000) victims of Nazi racial, religious or political persecution. These figures are for Germany in 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png and do not include Austria or foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe.
* (1953) The German economist :de:Bruno Gleitze from the German Institute for Economic Research estimated total war dead of 6,000,000; (3,100,000) military; (600,000) civilians killed in bombing raids and the land campaign; (800,000) deaths to expulsion from Poland (300,000) victims of Nazi racial, religious or political persecution, (1,200,000) increase in natural deaths due to the war. These figures are for Germany in 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png and do not include Austria or foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe.
* (1956) The West German Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office)estimated total war dead of 5,650,000 = (3,760,000) military; (430,000) civilians killed in bombing raids and the land campaign; (1,260,000) deaths to expulsion from Poland and (200,000) victims of Nazi racial, religious or political persecution. These figures are for Germany in 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png and do not include Austria or foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe.
* (1961) The West German government issued a statement listing a total of 7,032,800 war dead: (military dead 3,760,000 in prewar 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png and 432,000 foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe); (430,000 civilians killed in bombing raids and the land campaign in prewar 1937 borders); (300,000 victims of Nazi racial, religious or political persecution including 170,000 Jews); (expulsion dead 1,224,900 in prewar 1937 borders and 885,900 foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe). These figures do not include Austria. The Statistisches Jahrbuch für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland 1961, listed Austrian casualties as 250,000 military dead and 24,000 civilians killed in bombing raids
* (1984) A German demographic study estimated 6,900,000 deaths caused by the war in prewar 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png. (3,800,000) military and (3,100,000) civilians.
* (1991) A German demographic study estimated 5,450,000 to 5,600,000 war dead (4,300,000 military dead; 430,000 civilians killed in bombing raids and the land campaign and 882,000 deaths due to expulsions from Poland). These figures are for Germany in 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png and do not include Austria or foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe.
* (1998) A German demographic study estimated 5,500,000 to 6,900,000 war dead. These figures vary because of the shift of borders between 1937 and 1940.
* (2005) The German government issued a report listing total war dead of 7,375,800 (3,100,000 soldiers killed; 1,200,000 soldiers missing; 500,000 civilians killed in bombing raids; 2,251,500 civilian victims of expulsions and deportations; 24,300 Austrian civilians killed and 300,000 victims of Nazi racial, religious or political persecution. These figures include Austria and foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe.)

German military casualties
* (1945) The casualty figures compiled by the German High Command (OKW) as of January 31, 1945 put total military losses at 2,001,399 dead, 1,902,704 missing and POW held by Allies and 4,429,875 wounded.
* (1946) The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. estimated German military dead at 3,250,000.
* (1947) The combined staff of the U.K., Canada and the U.S. prepared &quot;A study of the employment of German manpower from 1933–1945&quot;. They estimated German casualties up until April 30, 1945, at 2,230,324 dead, 2,870,404 missing and POW held by Allies.
* (1960) The West German government issued figures of the war losses. Total military dead were put at 4,440,000 (3,760,000 in prewar 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png, 430,000 foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe and 250,000 Austria).
* (1974) The Maschke Commission found that about 1.2 million German military personnel reported as missing more than likely died as POWs, including 1.1 million in the USSR.
* (1985) The Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) has been responsible for providing information for the families of those military personnel who were killed or went missing in the war, they do not compile figures of the total war dead. By 1985 they had identified 3.1 million confirmed dead and 1.2 million missing and presumed dead. The Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) reported the same figures in 2005.
* (1993) The Russian historian Grigoriy Krivosheyev puts the losses of the &quot;Vlasovites, Balts and Muslims etc.&quot; in German service at 215,000 According to Krivosheev, 450,600 German POWs died in Soviet captivity (356,700 in camps and 93,900 in transit).
* (2000) Rüdiger Overmans, an associate of the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office, provided a reassessment of German military war dead based on a statistical survey of German military personnel records at the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt). The Overmans research project was financed by a private foundation and published with the endorsement of the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office of the Federal Ministry of Defense (Germany). The study found that the statistics compiled by German military during the war were incomplete and did not provide an accurate accounting of casualties. The research by Overmans concluded that German military dead and missing were 5,318,000 (4,456,000 in prewar 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png and 539,000 foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe, 261,000 Austria and 63,000 foreign nationals from western European nations). The Overmans study did not include Soviet citizens in German service. The details of the Overmans study are presented in German casualties in World War II. In a separate study, Overmans concluded that the actual death toll of German POWs was about 1.1 million men (including 1.0 million in the USSR).

Civilian Casualties
# 　German civilian casualties are combined from (a) air raid dead, (b) racial, religious and political persecution and (c) casualties due to expulsion of the Germans from east-central Europe:
#:(a) Official German and Austrian sources from the 1950s cite 434,000 air raid dead (410,000 in Germany, 24,000 in) Austria The figure cited by Overy (2013) is 353,000 air raid dead.
#:(b) The number of victims of Nazi persecution in Germany and Austria (victims of the Nazi euthanasia program) is estimated at close to 400,000 (300,000 in Germany, 100,000 in Austria). According to the German government the euthanasia accounted for an additional 200,000 victims.
#:(c) The number of victims of the flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50) is contentious. Estimates in the 1960s cited a total of 2,111,000 deaths, and the German government as of 2005 still maintained a number of &quot;ca. 2 million&quot;. Direct civilian deaths due to the expulsion of Germans is estimated at 600,000 by the German Federal Archive (1974) and at 500,000 to 600,000 by Haar (2009). The substantial difference of close to 1.5 million comprises people whose fate is uncertain in the reported German statistics. The German government maintains that these deaths are due to famine and disease during the flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50) This was disputed by historian Ingo Haar who maintains that the difference classified as missing is due to a decline in births, the assimilation of ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe after the war, the understatement of military casualties and murdered Jews.

Civilian casualties in air raids
&lt;poem&gt;*(1945–47) The United States Strategic Bombing Survey gave three different figures for German air raid deaths.
 1- The summary report of September 30, 1945 put total casualties for the entire period of the war at 305,000 killed and 780,000 wounded.
 2- The section &quot;Effects of Strategic Bombing on the German War Economy&quot; of October 31, 1945 put the losses at 375,000 killed and 625,000 wounded.
 3- The section &quot;The Effect of Bombing on Health and Medical Care in Germany&quot; of January 1947 made a preliminary calculated estimate of air raid dead at 422,000. Regarding overall losses, they concluded that &quot;It was further estimated that an additional number, approximately 25% of known deaths in 1944–45, were still unrecovered and unrecorded. With an addition of this estimate of 1944–45 unrecorded deaths, the final estimation gave in round numbers a half a million German civilians killed by Allied aerial attacks.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
* (1956) A German government study put German air war dead at 635,000; 500,000 killed by allied strategic bombing and 135,000 refugees killed during the evacuations from eastern Europe in 1945. These figures include 593,000 Germany in 1937 borders :File:DR1937.1.png (410,000 civilians, 32,000 foreigners and POW and 23,000 military and Police killed in strategic bombing and 127,000 civilians and 1,000 military and Police refugees fleeing on the eastern front). There were an additional 42,000 dead in Austria and the annexed territories (26,000 civilians, 7,000 foreigners and POW and 1,000 military and Police were killed in strategic bombing and 7,000 refugees fleeing on the eastern front).
* In 2014, Historian Richard Overy published a study of the air war, &quot;The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940–1945&quot;, in which he disputed the official German figures of air war dead. He estimated total air raid deaths at 353,000. Overy maintains that the German estimates are based on incorrect speculations for losses during the last three months of the war when there was a gap in the record keeping system. He points out that the figures for air raid dead in the last three months of the war were estimated in the West German figures from 1956 at 300,000 people which he believes is not plausible. The official figures include an inflated total of 60,000 in the Bombing of Dresden and the inclusion of refugees fleeing westward.

Civilians killed in 1945 military campaign
* The West German government in made a rough estimate in 1956 of 20,000 civilians killed during the 1945 military campaign in current post war German borders, not including the former German territories in Poland. However, there is a more recent estimate of 22,000 civilians killed during the fighting in Berlin only.

Deaths due to Nazi political, racial and religious persecution
* The West German government put the number of Germans killed by the Nazi political, racial and religious persecution at 300,000 (including 170,000 German Jews).
* A 2003 report by the German Federal Archive put the total murdered during the Action T4 Euthanasia program at over 200,000 persons.

Expulsion and flight of ethnic Germans
The following notes summarize German expulsion casualties, the details are presented in the flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950), the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union&#x27; and the Demographic estimates of the flight and expulsion of Germans. The figures for these losses are currently disputed, estimates of the total deaths range from 500,000 to 2,000,000. The death toll attributable to the flight and expulsions was estimated at 2.2 million by the West German government in 1958. German government reports which were released to the public in 1987 and 1989 have caused some historians in Germany to put the actual total at 500,000 to 600,000. English language sources put the death toll at 2 to 3 million based on the West German government statistical analysis of the 1950s.
* (1950) The West German government made a preliminary estimate of 3.0 million civilian deaths in the expulsions.(1.5 million in prewar 1937 Germany :File:Oder-neisse.gif and 1.5 million foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe)
* (1954–1961) The Schieder commission made preliminary estimates the civilian death toll in the expulsions of about 2.3 million persons, broken out as follows: 2,000,000 Poland (in post-war borders) and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia; 225,600 Czechoslovakia; 69,000 Yugoslavia; 40,000 Romania; 6,000 Hungary. These preliminary figures were superseded with the publication of the 1958 West German demographic study.
* (1958) A West German government demographic study estimated 2,225,000 civilians died during the flight during the war, post war expulsions and the Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union, broken out as follows: Germany in 1937 borders :File:Oder-neisse.gif 1,339,000; Poland in 1939 borders File:Rzeczpospolita 1923.png - Wikimedia Commons 185,000; Danzig 83,000; Czechoslovakia 273,000; Yugoslavia 136,000; Romania 101,000; Hungary 57,000; Baltic States 51,000.
* (1965), The search service of the German churches and Red Cross was able to confirm 473,013 civilian deaths in eastern Europe due to the expulsions, broken out as follows: 367,392 Poland (in post war borders); 18,889 Sudetenland; 64,779 Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia; 9,064 Baltic States; and 12,889 Germans resettled in Poland. There were an additional 1,905,991 unsolved cases of persons reported missing. The results of this survey were kept secret until 1987.
* (1966) The West German Federal Ministry for Expellees, Refugees and War Victims issued a statement that put the number of expulsion dead at 2,111,000 (1,225,000 Germany in 1937 borders :File:Oder-neisse.gif and 886,000 foreign nationals of German ancestry in eastern Europe)
* (1974) A study by the German Federal Archive estimated a death toll of 600,000 of civilians in the expulsions and deportations to the USSR. (400,000 in Poland (in post war borders) and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia; 130,000 in Czechoslovakia and 80,000 in Yugoslavia.) The authors of the report maintain that these figures cover only those deaths caused by violent acts and deaths in forced labor and internment camps. They also stated that their figures do not include deaths due to malnutrition and disease. This report was kept secret and not published until 1989.
* (1985) A demographic analysis which has the support of the German government, estimated 2,020,000 civilians died during the post war expulsions and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union broken out as follows: (870,000Germany in 1937 borders east of the Oder–Neisse line; 108,000 Germans resettled in Poland during the war; 174,000 Poland in 1939 borders File:Rzeczpospolita 1923.png - Wikimedia Commons; 40,000 Danzig; 220,000 Czechoslovakia; 106,000 Yugoslavia; 75,000 Romania; 84,000 Hungary; 33,000 Baltic States; 310,000 USSR)
* The German government currently maintains that 2.0 million civilians perished in the flight and expulsion from Eastern Europe. In 2006, Christoph Bergner, Secretary of State in Germany&#x27;s Bureau for Inner Affairs maintained that the figure of 2 million deaths is correct because it includes the deaths from malnutrition and disease of those civilians subject to the expulsions.
* A 2005 report by the German government search service put the death toll at 2,251,500, they did not provide details of the figure The current position in 2015 of the German government Federal Agency for Civic Education is that 2 million civilians perished in the expulsions, they cited as the source for this figure Gerhard Reichling, Die deutschen Vertriebenen in Zahlen.

German government figures of 2.0 to 2.5 million civilian deaths due to expulsions have been disputed by scholars since the publication of the results of the German church search service survey and the report by the German Federal Archive.
* German historian Rüdiger Overmans (2000) published a study of German military casualties; this project did not investigate civilian expulsion deaths. Overmans did, however, provide a critical analysis of the previous studies by German government of the human losses in the expulsions. Overmans maintains that these studies lack adequate support, that a figure of 500,000 expulsion dead is credible, and that there are more arguments for the lower figures rather than the higher figures. He believes that new research is needed to determine the correct balance of the human losses in the expulsions. According to him, the figure of 1.9 million missing persons reported by the search service is unreliable as it includes military dead and persons of dubious German ancestry who were not expelled after the war but remained in eastern Europe, also the figures for expellees living in the GDR was understated.
* In 2006, Historian Ingo Haar controversially disputed the official figures in an article published on 14 November 2006 in the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Haar argued for a total of 500,000 to 600,000 victims. Christoph Bergner, Secretary of state in the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, argued in an interview on 29 November against revising the official count of 2.0 to 2.5 million victims, and that the controversy was based on what he maintains is misunderstanding, as he stated that Haar&#x27;s figures represent the number violent deaths, while the official figures include the much more numerous deaths due to exhaustion, disease and starvation which occurred in the wake of the expulsions and deportations. Haar has published three articles in academic journals during 2006–2009 which covered the background of the research by the West German government on the expulsions. According to Haar the numbers were set too high for postwar political reasons. Haar argues that the government figure of two million is overstated. He maintains the total number of known German deaths east of the Oder–Neisse line and the ethnic Germans in East Central Europe lies between 500,000 and 600,000, including those deported to the Soviet Union. Haar argues that the number reported missing includes a decline in births, persons of dubious German nationality, military deaths and murdered Jews.
* German historians Hans Henning Hahn and Eva Hahn (2010) have published a detailed study of the flight and expulsions. They maintain that figures related to flight and expulsion have been manipulated by the German government due to political pressure. The Hahn&#x27;s believe the official German figure of 2 million deaths is an historical myth, lacking foundation. They place the ultimate blame for the mass flight and expulsion on the wartime policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe. The Hahn&#x27;s maintain that the 473,013 confirmed deaths is a correct accounting of the losses. Most of these losses occurred during the Nazi organized flight and evacuation during the war, and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union; they point out that there are 80,522 confirmed deaths in the postwar internment camps.
* The German Historical Museum puts the number of deaths due to the expulsions at 600,000, they maintain that the figure of 2 million deaths in the previous government studies cannot be supported.
* A joint Czech–German Historical Commission determined that between 15,000 and 30,000 Germans perished in the expulsions. The commission found that the demographic estimates by the German government of 220,000 to 270,000 civilian deaths due to expulsions from Czechoslovakia were based on faulty data. The Commission determined that the demographic estimates by the German government counted as missing 90,000 ethnic Germans assimilated into the Czech population; military deaths were understated and that the 1950 census data used to compute the demographic losses was unreliable.
* Polish historian Bernadetta Nitschke has provided a summary of the research in Poland on German losses due to the flight and resettlement of the Germans from Poland, not including other eastern European countries. Nitschke contrasted the estimate of 1.6 million deaths in Poland reported by the West German government in the 1950s with the figure of 400,000 (in Poland only) that was disclosed in 1989. According to Nitschke most of the civilian deaths occurred during the flight and evacuation during the war, the deportation to the U.S.S.R. for forced labor, and after the resettlement in the Soviet occupation zone in post war Germany.
* Polish historians Witold Sienkiewicz and Grzegorz Hryciuk believe that between 600,000 and 1.2 million German civilians perished during the wartime evacuations. The main causes of death were cold, stress, and bombing. According to Sienkiewicz and Hryciuk between 200,000 and 250,000 persons were held in postwar Polish internment camps and between 15,000 and 60,000 perished.

Post war increase in natural deaths
* German government figures of war losses do not include the increase in natural deaths with war casualties. The German economist Bruno Gleitze from the German Institute for Economic Research estimated that there were 1,200,000 excess deaths caused by the harsh conditions in Germany during and after the war. Gleitze estimated 400,000 excess deaths during the war and 800,000 in post war Germany The West German Statistisches Bundesamt put the actual deaths in 1939–46 due to natural causes at 7,130,000 persons, the demographic study by Peter Marschalck estimated the expected deaths in peacetime due to natural causes of 5,900,000 persons, a difference of 1,230,000 excess deaths. In Allied-occupied Germany the shortage of food was an acute problem in 1946–47. The average kilocalorie intake per day was only 1,600 to 1,800, an amount insufficient for long-term health.

　Greece
* The Greek government is planning to claim reparations from Germany for war damages.
* The Greek National Council for Reparations from Germany reports the following casualties during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Military dead 35,077, including: 13,327 killed in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41; 1,100 with the Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East, and 20,650 partisan deaths. Civilian deaths 171,845, including: 56,225 executed by Axis forces; 105,000 dead in German concentration camps (including Jews); 7,120 deaths due to bombing; 3,500 merchant marine dead; 600,000 Famine deaths during the war.
* A study published by Cambridge University Press in 2010 estimated that Greece suffered approximately 300,000 deaths during the Axis occupation as a result of famine and malnutrition.
* Gregory Frumkin, who was throughout its existence editor of the &quot;Statistical Year-Book of the League of Nations&quot; gave the following assessment of Greek losses in the war. He points out that &quot;the data on Greek war losses are frequently divergent and even inconsistent&quot;. His estimates for Greek losses are as follows: the war dead included 20,000 military deaths in the Greco-Italian War of 1940–41, 60,000 non-Jewish civilians, 20,000 non-Jewish deportees, 60,000 Jews and 140,000 famine deaths during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II.
* In campaigns against the Greek Resistance the German occupiers engaged in a policy of reprisals against civilians, the most notorious were the Distomo massacre and the Massacre of Kalavryta. According to the German historian Dieter Pohl at least 25,000 but perhaps even more civilians were killed in mass executions. Pohl maintains that about 1 million persons (14% of the population) were displaced in the campaigns against the Greek Resistance because their homes were destroyed or they were expelled and became refugees.

　Guam
* Guam was a United States administered territory during World War Two. The local Chamorro people were granted U.S. citizenship in the Guam Organic Act of 1950.
* According to an official U.S. report during the Battle of Guam on December 8–10, 4 Guam local military personnel and 3 Guam residents were killed in the battle. However, Japanese sources reported 40–50 of the local population killed.
* Between 1,000 to 2,000 Chamorro people were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment during the Japanese occupation of Guam from December 10, 1941, until August 10, 1944, including an estimated 600 civilians who were massacred by the Japanese during the Battle of Guam (1944).

　Hungary
* Tamás Stark of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has provided the following assessment of Hungarian losses. Military losses were 300,000 to 310,000 including 110–120,000 killed in action and 200,000 in Soviet POW and labor camps and 20,000–25,000 Jews in Hungarian military labor service. About 200,000 were from Hungary in the 1938 borders and 100,000 men who were conscripted from the annexed territories of Greater Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Civilian dead within the borders of present-day Hungary included 220,000 Hungarian Jews killed in the Holocaust and 44,000 deaths from military operations The Jewish population of Hungary in the 1941 borders was 764,000 (445,000 in the 1938 borders and 319,000 in the annexed territories). Holocaust deaths in the 1938 borders was 200,000 not including 20,000 men conscripted as forced labor for the military. During the Soviet occupation of Hungary, about 700,000 men were deported to Soviet Union, only 300,000 returned to Hungary.

　Iceland
* Confirmed losses of civilian sailors due to German attacks and mines.

　India
* India, which was a British colony during World War II, included the present-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. India under British administration is sometimes referred to as the British Raj.
* The war dead of 87,029 listed here are those reported by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
* Gurkhas recruited from Nepal fought with the British Indian Army during the Second World War. Gurkha casualties with the British Indian Army can be broken down as: 8,985 killed or missing and 23,655 wounded.
* The preliminary 1945 data for Indian losses was, killed 24,338, missing 11,754, wounded 64,354 and POW 79,489. Out of 60,000 Indian Army POWs taken at the Fall of Singapore, 11,000 died in captivity.
* The pro-Japanese Indian National Army lost 2,615 dead and missing.

Bengal famine of 1943
* Cormac Ó Gráda (2007): &quot;[E]stimates of mortality in [the Bengal famine of 1943] range from 0.8 million to 3.8 million; today the scholarly consensus is about 2.1 million (Hall-Matthews 2005; Sen 1981; Maharatna 1996).&quot;
* John W. Dower estimated 1.5 million civilian deaths in the Bengal famine of 1943.
* Amartya Sen currently the Lamont University Professor at Harvard University has recently estimated that a figure of 2.0 to 2.5 million fatalities may be more accurate.

　Iraq
* Losses during Anglo-Iraqi War and UK occupation in 1941.
* According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 150–180 Jews were killed in the Farhud pogrom in 1941.

　Ireland
* Although neutral, an estimated 70,000 of the Irish Free State&#x27;s citizens volunteered in the British military service. Some 40 Irish citizens were killed by accidental bombings in Dublin and Carlow, and 33 Irish merchant seamen were killed in U-boat attacks by Germany. The Irish Free State (&quot;Eire&quot;) being part of the British Commonwealth during the war, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission records 51 named civilians who died within its borders from effects of enemy action.

　Italy

&lt;poem&gt;
* The Italian government issued an accounting of the war dead in 1957, they broke out the losses before and after the Armistice with Italy: military dead and missing 291,376 (204,376 pre-armistice and 87,030 post armistice). Civilian dead and missing at 153,147 (123,119 post armistice) including in air raids 61,432 (42,613 post armistice). A brief summary of data from this report can be found online.
 Military war dead
 Confirmed dead were 159,957 (92,767 pre-armistice, 67,090 post armistice)
 Missing and presumed dead(including POWs) were 131,419 (111,579 pre-armistice, 19,840 post armistice)
 Losses by branch of service: Army 201,405; Navy 22,034; Air Force 9,096; Colonial Forces 354; Chaplains 91; Fascist militia
 10,066; Paramilitary 3,252; not indicated 45,078.
 Military Losses by theatre of war: Italy 74,725 (37,573 post armistice); France 2,060 (1,039 post armistice);
 Germany 25,430 (24,020 post armistice); Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia 49,459 (10,090 post armistice);
 USSR 82,079 (3,522 post armistice); Africa 22,341 (1,565 post armistice), at sea 28,438 (5,526 post armistice);
 other and unknown 6,844 (3,695 post armistice).
&lt;/poem&gt;
* Military losses in Italy after the September 1943 Armistice with Italy, included 5,927 with the Allies, 17,488 Italian resistance movement fighters in Italy and 13,000 RSI Italian Social Republic Fascist forces.
* Included in the losses are 64,000 victims of Nazi reprisals and genocide including 30,000 POWs and 8,500 Jews.
* According to Martin Gilbert, Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 8,000 in Italy and 562 in the Italian colony of Libya
* Updated studies (2010) by the &quot;Ufficio dell&#x27;Albo d&#x27;Oro&quot; of the Italian Ministry of Defence, p. 4 have revised the military deaths to 319,207, of which 246,432 belonged to the Army, 31,347 to the Navy, 13,210 to the Air Force, 15,197 to the Partisan formations and 13,021 to the armed forces of the Italian Social Republic. The casualties recorded for Italy do not include Italians who were born in Italian colonies and possessions (ethnic Italians in Libya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and the Dodecanese) and in national territories that Italy lost with the Paris peace treaty of 1947 (mainly the Julian March, Istria and Zara/Zadar; a large part of the victims of the Foibe massacres are thus not included). Also Africans conscripted by Italy are not included in their figures.
* With regards to the Partisan casualties, a ministerial study published in 1955 listed the partisans killed or executed as 35,828; however, the &quot;Ufficio dell&#x27;Albo d&#x27;Oro&quot; only considered as partisans the members of the Resistance who were civilians before joining the partisans, whereas partisans who were formerly members of the Italian armed forces (more than half those killed) were considered as members of their armed force of origin.
* With regards to the Italian Social Republic casualties, the &quot;Ufficio dell&#x27;Albo d&#x27;Oro&quot; excludes from its lists of the fallen the individuals who committed war crimes. In the context of the RSI, where numerous war crimes were committed in the anti-partisan warfare, and many individuals were therefore involved in such crimes (especially GNR and Black Brigades personnel), this influences negatively the casualty count, under a statistical point of view. The &quot;RSI Historical Foundation&quot; (&quot;Fondazione RSI Istituto Storico&quot;) has drafted a list that lists the names of some 35,000 RSI military personnel killed in action or executed during and immediately after World War II (including the &quot;revenge killings&quot; that occurred at the end of the hostilities and in their immediate aftermath), including some 13,500 members of the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana and Milizia Difesa Territoriale, 6,200 members of the Black Brigades, 2,800 Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana personnel, 1,000 Marina Nazionale Repubblicana personnel, 1,900 X MAS personnel, 800 soldiers of the &quot;Monterosa&quot; Division, 470 soldiers of the &quot;Italia&quot; Division, 1,500 soldiers of the &quot;San Marco&quot; Division, 300 soldiers of the &quot;Littorio&quot; Division, 350 soldiers of the &quot;Tagliamento&quot; Alpini Regiment, 730 soldiers of the 3rd and 8th Bersaglieri regiments, 4,000 troops of miscellaneous units of the Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano (excluding the above-mentioned Divisions and Alpini and Bersaglieri Regiments), 300 members of the &quot;Legione Autonoma Mobile &quot;Ettore Muti&quot;&quot;, 200 members of the &quot;Raggruppamento Anti Partigiani&quot;, 550 members of the Italian SS, and 170 members of the &quot;Cacciatori degli Appennini Regiment&quot;.
* This would bring the total number of Italian military personnel killed to some 341,000 (excluding colonial troops).
* According to the official history of the Italian Army (Rovighi, Alberto (1988), &quot;Le Operazioni in Africa Orientale: (giugno 1940 – novembre 1941)&quot; [Operations in East Africa: (June 1940 – November 1941)], Rome, Stato Maggiore Esercito, Ufficio storico) From June 1940 to 16 April 1941, 11,755 askaris were killed in Italian East Africa, excluding the losses in Giuba region and eastern fronts. After that date, in the last battles in East Africa there were 490 askaris killed in the battle of Culqualber and 3,700 killed in the battle of Gondar, plus an unknown number in the battle of Amba Alagi and other minor clashes. This would mean that the number of askaris killed in East Africa was likely somewhere between 16,000 and 20,000. According to the Italian Army official history (USSME, &quot;La prima offensiva Britannica in Africa Settentrionale&quot;, tomo I, allegato 32 (page 375)), the two Libyan colonial divisions lost 1,399 soldiers killed (not counting the officers, who were Italian) in the battle of Sidi Barrani, where they were both destroyed. There was not much use of colonial troops in North Africa afterwards.

　Japan
* Estimates for total Japanese war dead in 1937–1945 range from at least 2.5 million to 3.237 million.
* According to the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare Japanese war dead (1937–45) totaled 3.1 million persons including 2.3 million soldiers and Army/Navy civilian employees, 500,000 civilians in Japan and 300,000 civilians living outside of Japan. These figures include military dead of 30,000 Chinese from Taiwan and 22,182 Koreans.

Military dead
* According to a report compiled by the Relief Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in March 1964, combined Japanese Army and Navy deaths during the war (1937–45) numbered approximately 2,121,000; broken down as follows:

 &lt;poem&gt;

 French Indochina: 7,900, &quot;4,500,&quot; (12,400)
 Thailand: 6,900, &quot;100,&quot; (7,000)
 Burma (inc. India): 163,000, &quot;1,500,&quot; (164,500)
 Malaya &amp; Singapore: 8,500, &quot;2,900,&quot; (11,400)
 Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands: 900, &quot;1,500,&quot; (2,400)

 Celebes: 1,500, &quot;4,000,&quot; (5,500)
 Moluccas: 2,600, &quot;1,800,&quot; (4,400)
 New Guinea: 112,400, &quot;15,200,&quot; (127,600)
 Bismarck Archipelago: 19,700, &quot;10,800,&quot; (30,500)
 Solomon Islands: 63,200, &quot;25,000,&quot; (88,200)
 Total: 1,647,200, &quot;473,800,&quot; (2,121,000)
 &lt;/poem&gt;
Overall, perhaps two thirds of all Japanese military dead came not from combat, but from starvation and disease. In some cases this figure was potentially even higher, up to 80% in the Philippines and a staggering 97% in New Guinea.
* According to John W. Dower, the Japanese source Showa Shi – 1959 by Shigeki Toyama put Japanese war dead in 1937–1941 in the Second Sino-Japanese War at 185,467.
* In 1949 the report of the Japanese government Economic Stabilization Board put military war dead from December 1941 to December 21, 1946, at 1,555,308 Killed and 309,402 wounded. These figures do not include an additional 240,000 missing Army personnel. The figures of wounded show only those receiving pensions. The details of these figures are as follows:
 &lt;poem&gt;
 Army
 China after Pearl Harbor 202,958 killed and 88,920 wounded.
 vs. United States 485,717 killed and 34,679 wounded.
 vs. U.K. and Netherlands 208,026 killed and 139,225 wounded.
 vs. Australia 199,511 killed and 15,000 wounded.
 French Indochina 2,803 killed and 6,000 wounded.
 Manchuria &amp; USSR 7,483 killed and 4,641 wounded.
 other overseas 23,388 killed and 0 wounded.
 Japan proper 10,543 killed and 6,782 wounded.
 Army total 1,140,429 killed and 295,247 wounded.
 Navy
 Sailors 300,386 killed and 12,275 wounded and missing.
 Civilians in Navy service 114,493 killed and 1,880 wounded and missing.
 Navy total 414,879 killed and 14,155 wounded and missing.
 &lt;/poem&gt;
* The Japanese Central Liaison Office reported in July 1947 to the Allied occupation authorities that Japanese military dead in 1935–1945 were 1,687,738 (1,340,700 Army and 347,038 Navy.)
* The Yasukuni Shrine in Japan lists a total of 191,250 war dead from 1937 to 1941 in the Second Sino-Japanese War and 2,133,915 in the Pacific War Their figures include civilians who participated in combat and Chinese(Taiwan) and Koreans in the Japanese Armed Forces.
* According to the calculations of Werner Gruhl, Japanese military war dead were 2,565,878 (250,000 from 1931 to 1941 and 2,315,878 in 1942–45).
* John W. Dower maintains that &quot;only one third of the military deaths occurred in actual combat, the majority being caused by illness and starvation&quot;. According to Dower over 300,000 Japanese POW were missing after being captured by the Soviets. Japanese figures as of 12/31/1948 listed 469,074 missing personnel in Soviet hands, while at the same time the Soviets admitted to holding 95,000 Japanese prisoners thus leaving 374,041 surrendered Japanese personnel who were unaccounted for and presumed dead. According to Dower &quot;Known deaths of Japanese troops awaiting repatriation in Allied(non-Soviet) hands were listed as 81,090 by U.S. authorities.
* The Japanese Ministry of Welfare and Foreign Office reported from 1951 to 1960 that 254,000 military personnel and civilians were confirmed dead and 95,000 went missing in Soviet hands after the war. The details of these losses are as follows: 199,000 in Manchurian transit camps, 36,000 in North Korea, 9,000 on Sakhalin and 103,000 in the USSR.
* According to the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare 65,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the 1945 military campaign against the Soviet Union. After the war ended deaths at the hands of the Red Army and local Chinese population were 185,000 Manchuria, 28,000 in North Korea and 10,000 on Sakhalin and the Kurile islands. An additional 700,000 were taken prisoner by the Soviets were 50,000 died in forced labor in the USSR and Outer Mongolia.
* The Japanese government figures for POW deaths are not in agreement with Soviet figures. Russian sources report that the Soviets reported the POW deaths of 62,105 (61,855 Japanese and 214 collaborator forces) out of the 640,105 captured (609,448 Japanese and 30,657 collaborator forces).

Civilian Dead
* The 1949 report of the Japanese government Economic Stabilization Board detailed the casualties caused by air raids and sea bombardment. Total casualties were 668,315 including 299,485 dead, 24,010 missing and 344,820 injured. These figures include the casualties in Tokyo (東京) 97,031 dead, 6,034 missing and 113,923 injured; in Hiroshima (広島) 86,141 dead, 14,394 missing and 46,672 injured, in Nagasaki (長崎) 26,238 dead, 1,947 missing and 41,113 injured. According to John W. Dower, an error which appears in English language sources puts the total killed in air raids at 668,000, a figure which includes dead, missing and injured.
* A Japanese academic study published in 1979 by The Committee for the Compilation of Materials on Damage Caused by the Atomic Bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki puts the total dead in the atomic attacks at 140,000 (± 10,000) in Hiroshima and 70,000 (± 10,000) in Nagasaki. According to the authors of the report a study of atomic bomb related casualties in Hiroshima in December 1945 was &quot;lost and not discovered until twenty years later&quot;, they cited a similar survey in Nagasaki done in December 1945. The authors maintain that the lower casualty figures published in the immediate post war era did not include military personnel and missing persons. The figures of dead in the atomic attacks from this study were cited by John W. Dower in his &quot;War Without Mercy&quot;.
* According to the World Nuclear Association, &quot;In Hiroshima, of a resident civilian population of 250,000 it was estimated that 45,000 died on the first day and a further 19,000 during the subsequent four months. In Nagasaki, out of a population of 174,000, 22,000 died on the first day and another 17,000 within four months. Unrecorded deaths of military personnel and foreign workers may have added considerably to these figures. About 15 square kilometers (over 50%) of the two cities was destroyed. It is impossible to estimate the proportion of these 103,000 deaths, or of the further deaths in military personnel, which were due to radiation exposure rather than to the very high temperatures and blast pressures caused by the explosions.&quot; They noted that &quot;To the 103,000 deaths from the blast or acute radiation exposure at Hiroshima and Nagasaki have since been added those due to radiation-induced cancers, which amounted to some 400 within 30 years, and which may ultimately reach about 550. (Some 93,000 exposed survivors were still being monitored 50 years later.)&quot;
* The Radiation Effects Research Foundation puts the number of deaths (within two to four months), in Hiroshima at 90,000 to 166,000 persons, and in Nagasaki at 60,000 to 80,000 persons. They noted that deaths caused by the atomic bombings include those that occurred on the days of the bombings due to the overwhelming force and heat of the blasts, as well as later deaths attributable to radiation exposure. The total number of deaths is not known precisely because military personnel records in each city were destroyed; entire families perished, leaving no one to report deaths; and unknown numbers of forced laborers were present in both cities.
* The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey published the following estimates of Japanese casualties due to U.S. bombing.

1-Summary Report (July 1946) Total civilian casualties in Japan, as a result of 9 months of air attack, including those from the atomic bombs, were approximately 806,000. Of these, approximately 330,000 were fatalities.

2-United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Medical Division (1947) The bombing of Japan killed 333,000 civilians and injured 473,000. Of this total 120,000 died and 160,000 were injured in the atomic bombings, leaving 213,000 dead and 313,000 injured by conventional bombing.

3-The effects of air attack on Japanese urban economy. Summary report (1947) Estimated that 252,769 Japanese were killed and 298,650 injured in the air war.

4-The Effects of strategic bombing on Japanese morale Based on a survey of Japanese households the death toll was put at 900,000 dead and 1.3 million injured, the SBS noted that this figure was subject to a maximum sampling error of 30%.

5-Strategic Bombing Survey The Effects of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki The most striking result of the atomic bombs was the great number of casualties. The exact number of dead and injured will never be known because of the confusion after the explosions. Persons unaccounted for might have been burned beyond recognition in the falling buildings, disposed of in one of the mass cremations of the first week of recovery, or driven out of the city to die or recover without any record remaining. No sure count of even the prepaid populations existed. Because of the decline in activity in the two port cities, the constant threat of incendiary raids, and the formal evacuation programs of the Government, an unknown number of the inhabitants had either drifter away from the cities or been removed according to plan. In this uncertain situation, estimates of casualties have generally ranged between 100,000 and 180,000 for Hiroshima, and between 50,000 and 100,000 for Nagasaki. The Survey believes the dead at Hiroshima to have been between 70,000 and 80,000, with an equal number injured; at Nagasaki over 35,000 dead and somewhat more than that injured seems the most plausible estimate.

* John W. Dower puts Japanese civilian dead in Battle of Saipan at 10,000 and 150,000 in Battle of Okinawa based on a recent study of the campaign. However, American military sources put civilian dead on Okinawa at 42,000, they noted that Japanese sources indicate 50,000 Okinawan noncombatants were killed during the campaign.
* War related deaths of Japanese merchant marine personnel were 27,000.

　Korea
* American researcher R. J. Rummel estimated 378,000 Korean dead due to forced labor in Japan and Manchuria.

We do know that 5,400,000 Koreans were conscripted for labor beginning in 1939, but how many died can only be roughly estimated.&quot;
* Werner Gruhl estimated the civilian death toll due to the war and Japanese occupation at 533,000.
* John W. Dower has noted &quot;Between 1939 and 1945, close to 670,000 Koreans were brought to Japan for fixed terms of work, mostly in mines and heavy industry, and it has been estimated that 60,000 or more of them died under harsh conditions of their work places. Over 10,000 others were probably killed in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki&quot;.

　Poland

Total Polish war dead
* In 2009, Wojciech Materski and Tomasz Szarota of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) put the figure of Poland&#x27;s dead at between 5,620,000 and 5,820,000; including an estimated 150,000 Polish citizens who died due to Soviet repression. The IPN&#x27;s figures include 2.7 to 2.9 million Polish Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust and 2,770,000 ethnic Poles (including &quot;Direct War Losses&quot; −543,000; &quot;Murdered in Camps and in Pacification&quot; −506,000; &quot;Deaths in prisons and Camps&quot; 1,146,000; &quot;Deaths outside of prisons and Camps&quot; 473,000; &quot;Murdered in Eastern Regions&quot; 100,000; &quot;Deaths in other countries&quot; 2,000). Polish researchers have determined that the Nazis murdered 2,830,000 Jews (including 1,860,000 Polish Jews) in the extermination camps in Poland, in addition over 1.0 million Polish Jews were murdered by the Einsatzgruppen in the eastern regions or died of starvation and disease while in ghettos.
* In his 2009 book, Andrzej Leon Sowa of the Jagiellonian University emphasizes the lack of reliable data concerning World War II losses. According to him, between 2.35 and 2.9 million Polish citizens of Jewish ethnicity were killed, in addition to about two million ethnic Poles. He writes that not even estimated figures are available regarding Polish citizens of German, Ukrainian or Belarusian ethnicity.
* The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum states that &quot;[i]t is estimated that the Germans killed between 1.8 and 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians during World War II. In addition, the Germans murdered at least 3 million Jewish citizens of Poland.&quot;.
* Czesław Łuczak in 1993 estimated Poland&#x27;s war dead to be 5.9 to 6.0 million, including 2.9 to 3.0 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and 2.0 million ethnic Polish victims of the German and Soviet occupations, (1.5 million under German occupation and the balance of 500,000 in the former eastern Polish regions under Soviet occupation). Łuczak also included in his figures an estimated 1,000,000 war dead of Polish citizens from the ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian ethnic groups who comprised 20% of Poland&#x27;s pre-war population.
* Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated Poland&#x27;s losses in World War II to be 5.6 million; including 5,150,000 victims of Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles and The Holocaust, 350,000 deaths during the Soviet occupation in 1940–41 and about 100,000 Poles killed in 1943–44 during the massacres of Poles in Volhynia. Losses by ethnic group were 3,100,000 Jews; 2,000,000 ethnic Poles; 500,000 Ukrainians and Belarusians.
* Total losses by geographic area were about 4.4 million in present-day Poland and about 1.6 million in the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. Polish historian Krystyna Kersten estimated losses of about 2.0 million in the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. Contemporary Russian sources also include Poland&#x27;s losses in the annexed territories with Soviet war deaths.
* The official Polish government report on war damages prepared in 1947 listed 6,028,000 war victims during the German occupation (including 123,178 military deaths, 2.8 million Poles and 3.2 million Jews), out of a population of 27,007,000 ethnic Poles and Jews; this report excluded ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian losses. Losses were calculated for the territory of Poland in 1939, including the territories annexed by the USSR. The figure of 6.0 million war dead has been disputed by Polish scholars since the fall of communism who now put the total actual losses at about 3.0 million Jews and 2.0 million ethnic Poles, not including other ethnic groups (Ukrainians and Belarusians). They maintain that the official statistics include those persons who were missing and presumed dead, but actually remained abroad in the West and the USSR after the war.

Polish losses during the Soviet occupation (1939–1941)
* In August 2009, Wojciech Materski and Tomasz Szarota of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) estimated that 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation.
* In his 2009 book, Andrzej Leon Sowa of the Jagiellonian University states that about 325,000 Polish citizens were deported by the Soviets in 1940–41. The number of the deaths for which the Soviets are responsible &quot;probably did not exceed 100,000&quot;, and the same applies to the killings perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists.
* Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.
* In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000.
* An earlier estimate made in 1987 by Franciszek Proch of the Polish Association of Former Political Prisoners of Nazi and Soviet Concentration Camps estimated the total dead due to the Soviet occupation at 1,050,000.

Polish military casualties
* Poland lost a total of 139,800 regular soldiers and 100,000 Polish resistance movement fighters during the war. Polish military casualties. Military dead and missing were 66,000 and 130,000 wounded in the 1939 Invasion of Poland, in addition 17,000–19,000 were killed by the Soviets in the Katyn massacre and 12,000 died in German POW camps. The Polish contribution to World War II included the Polish Armed Forces in the West, and the 1st Polish Army fighting under Soviet command. Total casualties of these forces in exile were 33,256 killed in action, 8,548 missing in action, 42,666 wounded and 29,385 interned.The Polish Red Cross reported that the 1944 Warsaw Uprising cost the lives of 120,000–130,000 Polish civilians and 16,000–17,000 Polish resistance movement fighters. The names of Polish war dead are presented at a database online.
* During the war, 2,762,000 Polish citizens of German descent declared their loyalty to Germany by signing the Deutsche Volksliste. A West German government report estimated the deaths of 108,000 Polish citizens serving in the German armed forces, these men were conscripted in violation of international law. The Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) estimates 200,000–210,000 Polish citizens, including 76,000 ethnic Poles were conscripted into the Soviet armed forces in 1940–41 during the occupation of the eastern regions. The (IPN) also reported that the Germans conscripted 250,000 Polish nationals into the Wehrmacht, 89,300 later deserted and joined the Polish Armed Forces in the West.

　Timor
* Officially neutral, East Timor was occupied by Japan during 1942–45. Allied commandos initiated a guerrilla resistance campaign and most deaths were caused by Japanese reprisals against the civilian population. The Australian Dept. of Defence estimated the civilian death toll at 40,000 to 70,000. However, another source puts the death toll at 40,000 to 50,000.

　Romania
* Demographer Boris Urlanis estimated Romanian war dead at 300,000 military and 200,000 civilians.
* Total Romanian military war dead were approximately 300,000. Total killed were 93,326 (72,291 with Axis and 21,035 with Allies). Total missing and POW were 341,765 (283,322 with Axis and 58,443 with Allies), only about 80,000 survived Soviet captivity.
* Civilian losses included 160,000 Jewish Holocaust dead, the genocide of Roma people 36,000 and 7,693 civilians killed in Allied air raids on Romania.

　Ruanda Urundi
* The Ruzagayura famine from October 1943 to December 1944 was due to a local drought and the harsh wartime policies of the Belgian colonial administration to increase food production for the war effort in the Congo. By the time the famine ended between 36,000 and 50,000 people died of hunger in the territory. Several hundred thousand people also emigrated away from Ruanda-Urundi, most to the Belgian Congo but also to British Uganda.
* As Ruanda [Rwanda] was not occupied nor its food supply cut off, these deaths are not usually included with World War II casualties. However, at least one historian has compared the 1943 famine there to the Bengal famine of 1943, which is attributed to war.

　South Africa
* The war dead of 11,907 listed here are those reported by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
* The preliminary 1945 data for South African losses was killed 6,840, missing 1,841 wounded 14,363 and POW 14,589.

　South Seas Mandate
* This territory includes areas now known as the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands.
* Micronesian war related civilian deaths were caused by American bombing and shellfire; and malnutrition caused by the U.S. blockade of the islands. In addition the civilian population was conscripted by the Japanese as forced laborers and were subjected to numerous mindless atrocities.
* John W. Dower put Japanese civilian dead in Battle of Saipan at 10,000.
*　Soviet Union
The following notes summarize Soviet casualties, the details are presented in World War II casualties of the Soviet Union.
* A 1993 report published by the Russian Academy of Science estimated the total Soviet losses in World War II at 26.6 million The Russian Ministry of Defense in 1993 put total military dead and missing in 1941–45 at 8,668,400 These figures have generally been accepted by historians in the west. The total population loss of 26.6 million is an estimate based on a demographic study, it is not an exact accounting of the war dead. The figures of 26.6 million total war dead and 8.668 million military dead are cited by the Russian government for the losses in the war.
* Military war dead The figures for Soviet military war dead and missing are disputed. The official report on the military casualties was prepared by Grigori F. Krivosheev According to Krivosheev, the losses of the Red Army and Navy combat forces in the field were 8,668,400 including 5,226,800 killed in action, 555,500 non-combat deaths, 1,102,800 died of wounds 500,000 missing in action.The remaining balance includes 1,103,000 POW dead and 180,000 POWs who remained in western countries at the end of the war. Krivosheev maintains that the higher figure of 3.3 million POW dead cited in western sources is based on German figures and analysis. Krivosheev maintains that these statistics are not correct because they include reservists not on active strength, civilians and military personnel reported missing who were recovered during the course of the war. He maintains that the actual number captured were 4,559,000, he deducted 3,276,000 to arrive at his total of 1.283 million POW irrecoverable losses, his deductions were 500,000 reservists not on actual strength, 939,700 military personnel reported missing who were recovered during the war and 1,836,000 POWs who returned to the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Krivosheev&#x27;s figures are disputed by historians who put the actual losses at between 10.9 and 11.5 million. Critics of Krivosheev maintain that he underestimated the losses of POWs and missing in action and did he did not include the casualties of those convicted. Data published in Russia by Viktor Zemskov put Soviet POW losses at 2,543,000 (5,734,000 were captured, 821,000 released into German service and 2,371,000 liberated). Zemskov estimated the total military war dead were 11.5 million, including POW dead of 2.3 million and 1.5 million missing in action. S. N. Mikhalev estimated total military irrecoverable losses at 10.922 million. A recent study by Christian Hartmann put Soviet military dead at 11.4 million. Additional losses not included by Krivosheev were 267,300 who died of sickness in hospital, 135,000 convicts executed, and 422,700 convicts sent to penal units at the front. S. N. Mikhalev estimated total military demographic losses at 13.7 million. S. A. Il&#x27;enkov, an official of the Central Archives of the Russian Ministry of Defense, maintained, &quot;We established the number of irreplaceable losses of our Armed Forces at the time of the Great Patriotic War of about 13,850,000.&quot; Il&#x27;enkov and Mikhalev maintained that the field unit reports did not include deaths in rear area hospitals of wounded personnel and personnel captured in the early months of the war. Additional demographic losses to the Soviet military were those imprisoned for desertion after the war and deserters in German military service. According to Krivosheev, the losses of deserters in German service were 215,000. He listed 436,600 convicts who were imprisoned.
* Civilian war dead The Russian government puts the civilian death toll due to the war at 13,684,000 (7,420,000 killed, 2,164,000 forced labor deaths in Germany and 4,100,000 deaths due to famine and disease). A Russian academic study estimated an additional 2.5 to 3.2 million civilian dead due to famine and disease in Soviet territory not occupied by the Germans. Statistics published in Russia list civilian war losses of 6,074,857 civilians killed reported by the Extraordinary State Commission in 1946, 641,803 famine deaths during the siege of Leningrad according to official figures, 58,000 killed in bombing raids (40,000 Stalingrad,17,000 Leningrad and 1,000 Moscow), and an additional 645,000 civilian reservists that were killed or captured are also included with civilian casualties. The statistic of forced labor deaths in Germany of 2.164 million includes the balance of POW&#x27;S and those convicted not included in Krivosheev&#x27;s figures. In addition to these losses, a Russian demographic study of the wartime population indicated an increase of 1.3 million in infant mortality caused by the war and that 9–10 million of the 26.6 million total Soviet war dead were due to the worsening of living conditions in the USSR, including the region that was not occupied. The number deaths in the siege of Leningrad have been disputed. According to David Glantz, the 1945 Soviet estimate presented at the Nuremberg Trials was 642,000 civilian deaths. He noted that Soviet era source from 1965 put the number of dead in the Siege of Leningrad at &quot;greater than 800,000&quot; and that a Russian source from 2000 put the number of dead at 1,000,000. These casualties are for 1941–1945 within the 1946–1991 borders of the USSR. Included with civilian losses are deaths in the territories annexed by the USSR in 1939–1940 including 600,000 in the Baltic states and 1,500,000 in Eastern Poland. Russian sources include Jewish Holocaust deaths among total civilian dead. Gilbert put Jewish losses at one million within 1939 borders; Holocaust deaths in the numbered an additional 1.5 million, bringing total Jewish losses to 2.5 million.
* Alternative viewpoints According to the Russian demographer Dr. L.L. Rybakovsky, there are a wide range of estimates for total war dead by Russian scholars. He cites figures of total war dead that range from 21.8 million up to 28.0 million. Rybakovsky points out that the variables that are used to compute losses are by no means certain and are currently disputed by historians in Russia. Viktor Zemskov put the total war dead at 20 million, he maintained that the official figure of 26.6 million includes about 7 million deaths due to natural causes based on the mortality rate that prevailed before the war. He put military dead at 11.5 million, 4.5 million civilians killed and 4.0 due to famine and disease. Some Russian historians put the figure as high as 46.0 million by counting the population deficit due to children not born. Based on the birth rate prior to the war there is a population shortfall of about 20 million births during the war. The figures for the number of children born during the war and natural deaths are rough estimates because of a lack of vital statistics.
*There were additional casualties in 1939–40, which totaled 136,945: Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 (8,931), Invasion of Poland of 1939 (1,139), and the Winter War with Finland in 1939–40 (126,875). The names of many Soviet war dead are presented in the OBD Memorial database online.

American civilian dead #
* According to the Usmm.org, 9,521 merchant mariners lost their lives in the war (8,421 killed and 1,100 who later died of wounds). In 1950, the United States Coast Guard put U.S. Merchant Marine losses at 5,662 (845 due to enemy action, 37 in prison camps, and 4,780 missing), excluding U.S. Army transports and foreign flagged ships and they did not break out losses between the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.
* The names of U.S. Merchant Mariners killed in World War II are listed by USMM.org.
* The Civil Air Patrol assumed many missions including anti-submarine patrol and warfare, border patrols, and courier services. During World War II CAP&#x27;s coastal patrol had flown 24 million miles, found 173 enemy U-boats, attacked 57, hit 10 and sunk 2, dropping a total of 83 bombs and depth charges throughout the conflict. By the end of the war, 64 CAP members had lost their lives in the line of duty.
* According to U.S. War Department figures, 18,745 American civilians were interned in the war (13,996 in the Far East and 4,749 in Europe). A total of 2,419 American civilian internees were listed as dead and missing. Under Japanese internment, 992 died and another 544 were listed as &quot;unknown&quot;; under German internment, 168 died and a further 715 were listed as &quot;unknown&quot;.

* Six U.S. civilians were killed in Oregon in May 1945 by Japanese balloon bombs.

　Yugoslavia
* The official Yugoslav figure for total war dead is 1.7 million (300,000 military and 1,400,000 civilians). This figure is cited in reference works dealing with World War II. Studies in Yugoslavia by Franjo Tudjman and Ivo Lah put losses at 2.1 million However, the official Yugoslav figure has been disputed studies by Vladimir Žerjavić and Bogoljub Kočović who put actual losses at about 1.0 million persons. The calculation of Yugoslav losses is not an exact accounting listing of the dead, but is based on demographic calculations of the population balance which estimate births during the war and natural deaths. The number of persons who emigrated after the war (ethnic Germans, Hungarians, Italians and Yugoslav refugees to the west) are rough estimates.
* The U.S. Bureau of the Census published a report in 1954 that concluded that Yugoslav war-related deaths were 1,067,000. The U.S. Bureau of the Census noted that the official Yugoslav government figure of 1.7 million war dead was overstated because it &quot;was released soon after the war and was estimated without the benefit of a postwar census&quot;.
* A recent study by Vladimir Žerjavić estimates total war related deaths at 1,027,000, which included losses of 237,000 Yugoslav partisans and 209,000 &quot;Quislings and collaborators&quot; (see discussion below losses of Yugoslav collaborators) Civilian dead of 581,000 included 57,000 Jews. Losses by each Yugoslav republic were: Bosnia 316,000; Serbia 273,000; Croatia 271,000; Slovenia 33,000; Montenegro 27,000; Macedonia 17,000; and killed abroad 80,000.
* Bogoljub Kočović, a Yugoslav statistician, calculated the actual war losses at 1,014,000.
* Jozo Tomasevich, Professor Emeritus of Economics at San Francisco State University, stated that the calculations of Kočović and Žerjavić &quot;seem to be free of bias, we can accept them as reliable&quot;.

The losses of Yugoslav collaborators
* Croatian emigres in the west made exaggerated allegations that 500,000–600,000 Croatians and Chetniks were massacred by the Partisans after the war; these claims are cited by Rudolph Rummel in his study Statistics of Democide.Jozo Tomasevich noted that the figures of the number of collaborators killed by the Partisans are disputed. According to Tomasevich some Croatian exiles &quot;have been more moderate in their estimates&quot;, putting the death toll at &quot;about 200,000&quot;. Regarding the death toll in the reprisals by the Yugoslav partisans Tomasevich believed that &quot;It is impossible to establish the exact number of victims in these operations, although fairly accurate figures could probably be reached after much additional unbiased research&quot;.

The reasons for the high human toll in Yugoslavia were as follows
A. Military operations between the occupying German military forces and their &quot;Quislings and collaborators&quot; against the Yugoslav resistance.

B. German forces, under express orders from Hitler, fought with a special vengeance against the Serbs, who were considered Untermensch. One of the worst one-day massacres during the German military occupation of Serbia was the Kragujevac massacre.

C. Deliberate acts of reprisal against target populations were perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced the shooting of hostages on a large scale. At the end of the war, many Ustaše and Slovene collaborators were killed in or as a result of the Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators.

D. The systematic extermination of large numbers of people for political, religious or racial reasons. The most numerous victims were Serbs. According to Yad Vashem, &quot;During their four years in power, the Ustasa carried out a Serb genocide, exterminating over 500,000, expelling 250,000 and forcing another 200,000 to convert to Catholicism. The Ustasa also killed most of Croatia&#x27;s Jews, 20,000 Gypsies, and many thousands of their political enemies.&quot; According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum &quot;The Croat authorities murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serb residents of Croatia and Bosnia during the period of Ustaša rule; more than 30,000 Croatian Jews were killed either in Croatia or at Auschwitz-Birkenau&quot;.
 The USHMM reports between 77,000 and 99,000 persons were killed at the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps. The Jasenovac Memorial Site quotes a similar figure of between 80,000 and 100,000 victims. Stara Gradiška was a sub-camp of Jasenovac established for women and children. The names and data for 12,790 victims at Stara Gradiška have been established. Serbian sources currently claim that 700,000 persons were murdered at Jasenovac.
Some 40,000 Roma were murdered. Jewish victims in Yugoslavia totaled 67,122.
E. Reduced food supply caused famine and disease.
F. Allied bombing of German supply lines caused civilian casualties. The hardest hit localities were Podgorica, Leskovac, Zadar and Belgrade.

G. The demographic losses due to the reduction of 335,000 births and emigration of about 660,000 are not included with war casualties.

== China Burma India Theater ==
The China Burma India Theater served more as an Administrative Command rather than a Theater of Operations and lacked any true Operational Command. The Operational Command was joint Allied South East Asia Command in the South-East Asian Theater. The American General Joseph Stilwell commanded the operational Northern Combat Area Command and used his other positions to communicate directly with Joint Chiefs of Staff about operational matters.

The officially recognized US Army campaigns in the China Burma India Theater are:

* Burma campaigns:
** Burma 1942: 7 December 1941 – 26 May 1942, allied defensive operations during the Japanese conquest of Burma
** India-Burma: 2 April 1942 – 28 January 1945, allied operations in Burma 1942–43 and Burma and India 1944
** Central Burma: 29 January – 15 July 1945, the allied Burma offensive in 1945
* China campaigns:

** China Offensive: 5 May – 2 September 1945

<text>In camping, a ground pad, sleeping pad, thermal pad, sleeping mat, or roll mat is lightweight pad, common among hikers, backpackers and budget travelers, often used in conjunction with a sleeping bag. Its purpose is to provide padding and thermal insulation. All types currently available use air as their primary form of insulation.

In its simplest form a sleeping pad consists of a foam-like material that is about half a centimeter thick (about a quarter of an inch). The dimensions of the pad are usually about the same length as a sleeping bag and a little wider. Slight variations in design can be found, such as rippling in the foam, but these do not significantly affect the pad&#x27;s thermal properties.

A common misconception is that the pads are primarily for creating a more comfortable sleeping or sitting area. Instead, the primary purpose of the pad is to prevent the loss of body heat into the ground while sleeping. The materials used are typically filled with air pockets, slowing down the conduction of heat through the pad, as air is one of the best (and cheapest) insulators.

==Types==
===Manually inflated===
Closely related to the air mattress, a pad of this type requires an external pressure source to inflate, typically in the form of a pump or by blowing orally. Convection of the air inside the mattress reduces the amount of insulation it provides. More complicated mattresses reduce convection by partitioning the internal cavities, or by filling the cavities with material to trap the air such as down feathers or synthetic insulation. Manually inflated pads have the advantage of offering good thickness and a great deal of comfort while being lightweight and able to pack to a small size.

===Self-inflating===

An extension on the conventional manually inflated mattress, this type is capable of self-inflation due to the open-cell foam that fills the internal cavity. For many years this design was protected by various patents held by Cascade Designs and they were an unusual and premium item. But since these patents expired many other manufacturers are now producing this type of mattress and they are now commonplace. These mattresses are lightweight and pack to a small size, which make them popular amongst hikers and campers.

===Foam===
Closed-cell foam is used to produce mats that can be used without requiring any inflation. Closed-cell foam pads are lighter and more durable than their self-inflating counterparts, as they are constructed of fewer materials and not susceptible to damage from accidental puncture. Many may also be trimmed to size should the user choose to do so. However, they are generally not as comfortable as manually inflated and self-inflating mats because they are thinner, and may also take up more space in a pack, depending on the materials used. Variations include textured or shaped foam to increase the unrolled volume and/or change the stiffness of the mattress. This can also be used to trap the air within ridges or an egg-carton type of texture.

Open-cell foam, although comfortable, is rarely used in the outdoors due to its ability to absorb water (like a sponge) and its air cells are crushed in use reducing its insulation capacity.

==Insulation ratings==
A sleeping pads&#x27;s warmth is characterized by R-value. But unlike sleeping bags&#x27; EN 13537 test standard and widely accepted recommendations, sleeping pad R-values lacks a simple mapping and label for &#x27;how much warmth&#x27; a consumer should expect. Combining various standards and various authors&#x27; research, an approximate R-value to temperature chart follows: 

Same as EN 13537, a &quot;standard man&quot; is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.73 m and a weight of 73 kg; a &quot;standard woman&quot; is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.60 m and a weight of 60 kg. The sleeping bag and pad system (above, below, and sides) should provide the same insulation value all around a person, but cost, size, weight, comfort, and lack-of-knowledge often lead persons to reduce the R-value to below their personal &#x27;recommended R-value&#x27;. Since the pad and bag work together, a &#x27;warmer&#x27; bag can compensate the a &#x27;thin&#x27; pad and a &#x27;thick pad&#x27; for a &#x27;cold&#x27; bag. Highly heat-conductive surfaces (e.g. concrete, granite) require more insulation for the same temperature than insulating ground surfaces (e.g.snow, dry moss, loose soil, wood, etc.). More heat is lost downward when sleeping on one&#x27;s stomach vs sleeping one&#x27;s side (due to reduced contact area and cooler body parts in contact). Most persons can &#x27;feel the cold ground&#x27; at approximately half the &#x27;recommended R-values&#x27;.

Sleeping pads R-values range from 1 to more than 10. A few category examples follow:

<text>Austrelaps is a genus of venomous elapid snakes native to the relatively fertile, temperate, southern and eastern part of the Australian continent. Three species are currently recognized, with no subspecies. They are commonly called copperheads or Australian copperheads. They are not closely related to the American copperhead, &quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;.

==Description==
There are three species of Australian copperheads: the pygmy copperhead, the highland copperhead, and the lowland copperhead. The pygmy copperhead is long, and lives in South Australia and on Kangaroo Island. The highland copperhead is in length and lives in alpine areas of Victoria and New South Wales. The lowland copperhead reaches in length and lives in southern Victoria into Tasmania. Their colour varies a great deal, from a coppery mid-brown to yellowish, reddish, grey or even black, depending on the individual. The copper head colouring that gave rise to the common name is not always present. Some individuals also have visible markings just behind the head. Perhaps in consequence of their great variation, it was not realised until the second half of the 20th century that there were three different species. Venom toxicity has been measured at 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous, at least for the lowland copperhead.

==Common names==
Common names include copperhead, diamond snake, superb snake, lowland snake, and highland snake.

==Distribution and habitat==
Copperheads are well adapted to cooler climates; they remain active after most reptiles have become dormant, and are the first to resume hunting at the end of winter. Their favoured habitat is near water. While they are moderately uncommon elsewhere, they congregate in substantial numbers where conditions are suitable.

==Behaviour==
Copperheads are diurnal at most times of year, but switch to night hunting in hot weather.

===Diet===
Copperheads are very much at home in the water; they swim well and often hunt tadpoles. They are generalised carnivores and will take any suitably-sized prey, including their own young, but the major diet item is frogs. Where frogs are common, so too are copperheads, and other snakes tend to be rare.

===Breeding===
Breeding starts in spring, and females give birth in late summer to about 14 live young, each a little under long.

===Venom===
Like all elapids (members of the family Elapidae), Australian copperheads have hollow, fixed fangs mounted at the front of the jaw. They are shy and retiring by nature, and prefer to escape rather than fight where escape is possible. Their venom is, by Australian standards, only moderately toxic (equal on a per-mg basis to that of the Indian cobra). Nevertheless, they deliver a substantial quantity of venom, and a copperhead bite left untreated can easily kill a healthy adult human. There is no specific copperhead antivenom, but tiger snake antivenom is effective.

<doc id="240906" wikidata="Q4912854" url="?curid=240906" title="Billy Kinsley">
<text>William Ellis Kinsley (born 28 November 1946) is an English musician, who was lead vocalist and bassist with the Merseybeats until 1966 (although he temporarily left the band to form the Kinsleys). The group disbanded in January 1966 to resurface as a duo called the Merseys. They recorded the McCoys&#x27; song &quot;Sorrow&quot; (also covered by David Bowie on his 1973 cover album, &quot;Pin Ups&quot;) with the band before embarking on a solo career, where he recorded &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; (not to be confused with a Four Seasons track of a similar title), a typical Merseybeat tune, followed by the singles &quot;Annabella&quot;, and &quot;You Make My Day&quot;.

== Early life ==
William Ellis Kinsley was born in Anfield, Liverpool.

== Career ==
Kinsley formed the Mavericks in 1960 with Tony Crane. They became the Pacifics in 1961 and then the Merseybeats in 1962. They were signed to Fontana Records, and in 1964, Billy left the band to form his own group, the Kinsleys. After an album release with John Gustafson, he returned by the end of the year. The Merseybeats ended in 1966, and Kinsley and Crane carried on as rock duo the Merseys. They had a major hit with their first single, a cover of the McCoys&#x27; &quot;Sorrow&quot;, which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. They had a backing band called the Fruit Eating Bears, which included guitarist Joey Molland, later of Badfinger.

The Merseys ended in 1969, and Kinsley, Crane and a new lineup of performers recreated the Merseybeats. Kinsley left the band in 2020, and Crane carries on the bands legacy with his band Adrian.

His session work notably included working for Apple Records (alongside George Harrison on at least one song for Jackie Lomax). He also worked on the popular &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; record series, which contained anonymous cover versions of recent and current hit singles. During this time he worked with fellow musician friend, Jimmy Campbell, and formed the band Rockin&#x27; Horse. They recorded one album and toured England and Europe as the backing band for Chuck Berry.

Kinsley later formed Liverpool Express in the mid-1970s, and again experienced chart success with &quot;You Are My Love&quot;, mentioned by Paul McCartney as one of his favourite love songs, plus &quot;Every Man Must Have A Dream&quot;, &quot;Dreamin&quot;, &quot;Hold Tight&quot;, and &quot;Smile&quot;. They toured the UK and Europe supporting Rod Stewart, released more singles, and found popularity in South America (they were the first band to play large stadiums in Brazil). They had quite a few hit singles all over South America, and three of their singles (&quot;You Are My Love&quot;, &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Every Man Must Have A Dream&quot;) reached No. 1 in the charts. In 1978, they played at the Royal Gala Performance at the request of Prince Charles, at the Empire Theatre in Liverpool. The following year, after three albums and more single releases, they had no further chart success.

Kinsley formed a side band, the Cheats, with members Kenny Parry (guitar), and Brian Rawling (drums), playing pubs and clubs in and around Merseyside. In the mid-1980s, Phil Chittuck joined the band in place of Rawling, and they released the following two singles (as Liverpool Express): &quot;So What&quot; and &quot;If You&#x27;re Out There&quot;. Kinsley later took on more session work. Then most notably he joined (with old friend Kenny Parry) the Pete Best Band, with whom he recorded a live album &quot;Live At The Adelphi&quot; (recorded in 1988), and on which he plays bass and sings lead vocal and is credited with &quot;editing&quot; (the album was not released until the 1990s) as well as working on a single (&quot;Heaven&quot;). In the mid-1990s, Kinsley re-joined the Merseybeats. In 1999, he once again joined the Pete Best Band and recorded &quot;Casbah Coffee Club&quot;, which he produced and sang lead vocal, played bass, and rhythm guitar (once again bringing along his friend Kenny Parry to play lead guitar on some tracks). Liverpool Express recorded an album in 2003, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, which followed a best of album, and a single, a tribute to the Beatles, titled &quot;John George Ringo &amp; Paul&quot;.

In 2009, Spencer Leigh of BBC Radio Merseyside produced a four-part radio series about Kinsley&#x27;s career, entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Love That Really Counts&quot;, which featured interviews with Kinsley and others, and music from his career. A book was also issued under the same title, as well as a CD featuring new recordings.

<text>Daddy Day Care is a 2003 American family comedy film starring Eddie Murphy in the lead role, Jeff Garlin, Steve Zahn, Regina King, and Anjelica Huston. Written by Geoff Rodkey and directed by Steve Carr, it marks Murphy and Carr&#x27;s second collaboration after &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; (2001). The plot follows two fathers who start a child day care out of their home after they are laid off from their corporate jobs.

The film was released in the United States on May 9, 2003, by Columbia Pictures. It received generally negative reviews from critics, but grossed $164.4 million worldwide on a budget of $60 million. The movie was followed by two sequels, in the film series of the same name.

==Plot==

Charlie Hinton is a marketing executive at a local food company. He and his wife, Kim, have just enrolled their son Ben into Chapman Academy, an overly academic preschool overseen by the haughty Gwyneth Harridan. However, on Ben&#x27;s first day, Charlie and his best friend Phil are laid off (alongside 300 others) when the company shuts down their health division due to the poor reception of their vegetable-flavored breakfast cereals. Charlie breaks the news to Kim and Ben at dinner but assures them he will find a new job.

While Kim supports the family by returning to work as a lawyer, Charlie, after six weeks of job hunting and finding nothing, is forced by the bank to take Ben out of Chapman. Unable to find a satisfactory alternative around town, Charlie decides to open a daycare center in his home with the help of Phil, calling it &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;. Although local parents are suspicious of men working with kids, a few choose their service as it is more affordable and child-based.

Charlie and Phil open with a few children, struggling at first with chaos and some personal issues. Angered at losing children to the new competition, Harridan attempts to shut them down by notifying child services. Charlie and Phil find themselves rectifying problems pointed out by Dan Kubitz, a director of child services, to ensure their daycare is suitable for children. They then hire their former colleague, Marvin, as an additional care provider. In time, they start to enjoy running Daddy Day Care as it grows in popularity, with Charlie delighted to see Ben making friends and enjoying himself.

When Kubitz points out that the house cannot accommodate the number of children they now have, he suggests that they either remove two kids or find a permanent facility somewhere in town. Not willing to remove any of the children, Charlie chooses the latter option. Marvin tells them of a suitable vacant building, but they cannot afford it, so they decide to hold a fundraiser to earn the necessary capital. However, Harridan learns about the event and sabotages it with help from her hesitant assistant Jennifer. As a result, Daddy Day Care does not raise enough money to pay for the building.

Eventually, the food company offers Charlie and Phil their old jobs back at double their salaries, having decided to rehire them and letting them run the whole health division after acting on an earlier idea that Charlie had sarcastically suggested. Harridan also offers to take in their children for a more affordable price if Daddy Day Care shuts down. Charlie and Phil reluctantly accept the offer, leaving Marvin heartbroken and refusing to join them. Ben is also disappointed when Charlie tells him he has to go back to Chapman. The next day at the marketing meeting, Charlie questions his decision after he realizes the impact Daddy Day Care has had on Ben and the other children. Deciding that Ben is the most important thing to him, Charlie quits, convincing Phil to join him and re-open Daddy Day Care. Informing Marvin of their plans, Charlie confronts Harridan during a student orientation and reveals to the parents in attendance how little she cares about their children. After mentioning how much Daddy Day Care changed and helped the children, Charlie declares that Daddy Day Care is reopened and convinces the parents to return.

Six months later, Daddy Day Care manages to buy the building it needs to expand and prospers, with Charlie and Phil now successful, Jennifer now working for the center, and Marvin entering a relationship with one of the parents. With Chapman no more, Harridan is forced to work as a crossing guard. When one of Harridan&#x27;s former students, Crispin, gives Harridan a flower, it attracts bees, causing her to wave the stop sign to shoo them away and inadvertently create a traffic jam.

==Cast==
Cheap Trick appear as themselves at the Rock for Daddy Day Care charity event when they perform Surrender.

==Production==
The film was initially set up at 20th Century Fox, but Fox placed the film into turnaround due to budget concerns. It sold the film to Revolution Studios.

Shooting began on August 1, 2002, in Los Angeles, California and wrapped on November 22.

The film&#x27;s poster was officially released in December of that year, with the tagline, &quot;D-Day is coming.&quot;

==Release==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; has an approval rating of 27% based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 4.51/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; does its job of babysitting the tots. Anyone older will probably be bored.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Todd McCarthy from &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;scarcely more amusing than spending ninety minutes in a pre K classroom&quot; and a &quot;comically undernourished junk food snack&quot;.

===Box office===
Despite the negative critical ratings, the film was a box office success, grossing over $160 million worldwide based on a $60 million budget. The film was released in the United Kingdom on July 11, 2003, and opened at No. 3, behind &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; and &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;. The next two weekends, the film moved down one place, before finally ending up at No. 10 on August 1.

==Sequels==

Soon after the release of &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;, Murphy was rumored to be involved in a sequel film, although he had not signed up for one. A sequel was released on August 8, 2007, titled &quot;Daddy Day Camp&quot;, with Cuba Gooding Jr. replacing Murphy as Charlie Hinton and Sony once again distributing the film (this time under TriStar). The film was panned by critics, with a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It won the Razzie Award for &quot;Worst Prequel or Sequel&quot;. Another sequel, &quot;Grand-Daddy Day Care&quot;, was released on February 5, 2019, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on direct-to-video format. Da&#x27;Vone McDonald portrayed Charlie Hinton, who appears as a supporting character.

<doc id="240909" wikidata="Q1859550" url="?curid=240909" title="Yoshiwara">
<text>was a famous (red-light district) in Edo, present-day Tokyo, Japan. Established in 1617, Yoshiwara was one of three licensed and well-known red-light districts created during the early 17th century by the Tokugawa shogunate, alongside Shimabara in Kyoto in 1640 and Shinmachi in Osaka.

Created by the shogunate to curtail the tastes of and sequester the nouveau riche (merchant) classes, the entertainment offered in Yoshiwara, alongside other licensed districts, would eventually originate geisha, who would become known as the fashionable companions of the classes and simultaneously cause the demise of , the upper-class courtesans of the red-light districts.

==History==
===17th and 18th century===


The licensed district of Yoshiwara was created in the city of Edo, near to the area today known as Nihonbashi, itself close to the beginning of the Tōkaidō road, the primary route to western Kyoto during the Edo period.

In 1656, due to the need for space as the city grew, the government decided to relocate Yoshiwara, with plans being made to move the district to its present location north of Asakusa on the outskirts of the city. The location corresponds to modern-day Senzoku 4-Chōme in Tokyo Taitō-ku. It was accessible via the Sanyo canal which was eventually filled in.

Having been established some decades earlier, the original Yoshiwara district burned down, along with much of the city, in the Great fire of Meireki of 1657; it was then rebuilt in its new location, named &#x27;Shin Yoshiwara&#x27; (&#x27;New Yoshiwara&#x27;), the old location being known as &#x27;Moto Yoshiwara&#x27; (&#x27;Original Yoshiwara&#x27;), though the moniker of &#x27;new&#x27; was eventually dropped, with the rebuilt district becoming known simply as Yoshiwara.

Yoshiwara was home to some 1,750 women in the 18th century, with records of some 3,000 women from all over Japan at one time. Many were typically indentured to their brothel; if indentured by their parents, a larger advance payment would often be received. Though contracts of indenture often did not last more than five to ten years, the debt sometimes accrued by these women could keep them working there for much longer. However, a significant number either served out their contracts and married a client, went into other employment (including other forms of prostitution), or returned to their family homes. In these cases, the advanced payments a woman&#x27;s parents received could be used to fund her dowry. Despite this, many women also died of sexually transmitted diseases, or following failed abortions, before completing their contracts.

If chosen to receive the correct training at a young age, a girl indentured to a brothel could become an apprentice to a high-ranking courtesan; when the girl was old enough and had completed her training, she would become a courtesan herself and work her way up the ranks. Another path to success and eventual freedom for a working woman in Yoshiwara was for a rich man to buy out her contract from the brothel, and thus keep her as his wife or mistress; a further path would be for a woman to work successfully enough that she could eventually buy her own freedom, though this was an uncommon and infrequent occurrence.

Social classes were not strictly divided in Yoshiwara; a commoner with enough money would be served as an equal to a samurai, and though samurai were discouraged from entering Yoshiwara, they often did so, the only requirement being that their weapons be left at the town&#x27;s entrance. By law, brothel patrons were only allowed to stay for a night and a day at a time. Like all official policies for Yoshiwara, this was rarely enforced.

Following its inception, Yoshiwara became a strong commercial area, with the fashions created in the town by prostitutes changing frequently and creating a great demand for merchants and artisans. Traditionally, prostitutes were supposed to wear only simple blue robes, but this was rarely enforced. In contrast, the highest ranking (courtesans) came to be emblematic of the height of Edo period fashion, wearing colourful and expensive silk kimono alongside elaborate hairstyles and a number of hair accessories; these outfits frequently dictated the contemporary trends of fashion in Japan of the time.
Despite the reputation of Yoshiwara and its highest-ranking courtesans, most prostitutes working in the area came from poor families, would be commonly exploited, and were so poor that, when they died, their bodies would be brought anonymously to Jōkan-ji temple and left at the back entrance, a proper burial being too expensive to afford. The temple therefore also became known as &#x27;Nage-komi dera&#x27; (&#x27;Throw-away temple&#x27;); a memorial in the temple to thousands of anonymous prostitutes of Yoshiwara was consecrated in the Meiji era.

===19th, 20th and 21st century===

The area had over 9,000 women in 1893, many of whom suffered from syphilis. In 1913, the area was damaged by an extensive fire, and further damaged to the point of near-obliteration a decade later by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. However, Yoshiwara remained in business as a traditional red-light district until prostitution was outlawed by the Japanese government in 1958 following World War II.

Though technically illegal – with the definition of prostitution under the Prostitution Prevention Law being &#x27;compensated penetrative sex with an unspecified person&#x27; other forms of sex work that do not violate this law continue to exist in the modern area of Yoshiwara, with the portion of the town near Minowa Station on the Hibiya Line, now known as Senzoku Yon-chōme, retaining a large number of soaplands and other façades for sexual services.

== People and services ==

People involved in would include (comedians), kabuki actors, dancers, dandies, rakes, tea-shop girls, Kanō (painters of the official school of painting), courtesans who resided in (green houses) and geisha in their .

The sex workers found within Yoshiwara would consist of  (; the district&#x27;s rank and file prostitutes), (young female students), (senior female students), (lower-ranking courtesans), (high-ranking courtesans just below ), (high-ranking courtesans), , (older chaperones for an ), and the who replaced the when they were priced out of the market.

In addition to courtesans, there were also geisha, apprentice geisha, geisha (male geisha), (patrons of geisha), and the female managers of teahouses and . The lines between geisha and courtesans were, officially, sharply drawn soon after the inception of the geisha profession; laws were passed forbidding a geisha from being sexually involved with a customer. In reality a number of exceptions existed, with geisha ranging from little more than themselves to geisha who offered only artistic entertainment and companionship.

== Today ==

Today, Yoshiwara roughly corresponds to . Yoshiwara today looks very similar to many other neighborhoods of modern Tokyo, but it retains legacies to its past, as it contains commercial establishments engaged in the sex trade although police cracked down on the soaplands in 2007. The street grid pattern and the temples and shrines from times past still exist.

<text>Mongkut (18 October 18041 October 1868) was the fourth king of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, titled Rama IV. He reigned from 1851 until his death in 1868.

The reign of Mongkut was marked by significant modernization initiatives and diplomatic engagements, which played pivotal roles in shaping Thailand&#x27;s trajectory towards progress and international relations. Siam first felt the pressure of Western expansionism during Mongkut&#x27;s reign. Mongkut embraced Western innovations and initiated the modernization of his country, both in technology and culture—earning him the nickname &quot;The Father of Science and Technology&quot; in Siam.

Mongkut was also known for appointing his younger brother, Prince Chutamani, as Second King, crowned in 1851 as King Pinklao. Mongkut told the country that Pinklao should be respected with equal honor to himself (as King Naresuan had done with his brother Ekathotsarot in 1583). During Mongkut&#x27;s reign, the power of the House of Bunnag reached its zenith: It became the most powerful noble family of Siam.

Mongkut is known in the West primarily through the lens of the 1951 musical &quot;The King and I&quot; and its 1956 film adaptation.

==Early life==

Mongkut (, literal meaning: &quot;crown&quot;) was the second son of Prince Itsarasunthon, son of Phutthayotfa Chulalok, the first Chakri king of Siam (King Rama I) and Princess Bunrot. Mongkut was born in the Old (Thonburi) Palace in 1804, where the first son had died shortly after birth in 1801. He was followed by Prince Chutamani () in 1808. In 1809, Prince Itsarasunthon was crowned as Phutthaloetla Naphalai (later styled King Rama II.) The royal family then moved to the Grand Palace. Thenceforth, until their own accessions as kings, the brothers ( ) were called Chao Fa () and Chao Fa ().

==Monastic life and Dhammayut sect==
In 1824, Mongkut became a Buddhist monk (ordination name &quot;Vajirayan&quot;; Pali &quot;Vajirañāṇo&quot;), following a Siamese tradition that men aged 20 should become monks for a time. The same year, his father died. By tradition, Mongkut should have been crowned the next king, but the nobility instead chose the older, more influential and experienced Prince Chetsadabodin (Nangklao), son of a royal concubine rather than a queen. Perceiving the throne was irredeemable and to avoid political intrigues, Mongkut retained his monastic status.

Vajirayan became one of the few members of the royal family who devoted his life to religion. He travelled around the country as a monk and saw the relaxation of the rules of the Pali Canon among the Siamese monks he met, which he considered inappropriate. In 1829, at Phetchaburi, he met a monk named Buddhawangso, who strictly followed the monastic rules of discipline, the vinaya. Vajirayan admired Buddhawangso for his obedience to the vinaya, and was inspired to pursue religious reforms.

In 1835, he began a reform movement reinforcing the vinaya law that evolved into the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, or Dhammayut sect. A strong theme in Mongkut&#x27;s movement was that, &quot;…true Buddhism was supposed to refrain from worldly matters and confine itself to spiritual and moral affairs&quot;. Mongkut eventually came to power in 1851, as did his colleagues who had the same progressive mission. From that point on, Siam more quickly embraced modernization. Vajirayan initiated two major revolutionary changes. Firstly, he embraced modern geography, among other sciences considered &quot;Western&quot;. Secondly, he sought reform in Buddhism and, as a result, a new sect was created in Siamese Theravada Buddhism. Both revolutions challenged the purity and validity of the Buddhist order as it was practiced in Siam at the time.

In 1836, Vajirayan arrived at Wat Bowonniwet in what is now Bangkok&#x27;s central district, but was then the city proper, and became the wat&#x27;s first abbot (). During this time, he pursued a Western education, studying Latin, English, and astronomy with missionaries and sailors. Vicar Pallegoix of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangkok lived nearby; the two became close friends, and Vajirayan invited Pallegoix to preach Christian sermons in the wat. Vajirayan admired Christian morals and achievements as presented by the vicar, but could make nothing of Christian doctrine. It was then that he made the comment later attributed to him as king: &quot;What you teach people to do is admirable, but what you teach them to believe is foolish.&quot;

King Mongkut would later be noted for his excellent command of English, although it is said that his younger brother, Viceroy Pinklao, could speak it even better. Mongkut&#x27;s first son and heir, Chulalongkorn, granted the Thammayut sect royal recognition in 1902 through the Ecclesiastical Polity Act; it became one of the two major Buddhist denominations in modern Thailand.

Chulalongkorn also persuaded his father&#x27;s 47th child, Vajirañana, to enter the order and he rose to become the 10th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand from 1910 to 1921.

==Reign as king==

Accounts vary about Nangklao&#x27;s intentions regarding the succession. It is recorded that Nangklao verbally dismissed the royal princes from succession for various reasons; Prince Mongkut was dismissed for encouraging monks to dress in the Mon style.

Prince Mongkut was supported by the pro-British Dit Bunnag who was the &quot;Samuha Kalahom&quot;, or Armed Force Department&#x27;s president, and the most powerful noble during the reign of Rama III. He also had the support of British merchants who feared the growing anti-Western sentiment of the previous monarch and saw the &#x27;prince monk&#x27; Mongkut as the &#x27;champion&#x27; of European influence among the royal elite.

Bunnag, with the supporting promise of British agents, sent his men to the leaving-from-monk-status ceremony for Prince Mongkut even before Nangklao&#x27;s death. With the support of powerful nobility and Britain, Mongkut&#x27;s ascension to the throne was ensured.

After his twenty-seven years of monastic life, King Mongkut voluntarily defrocked and ascended the throne in 1851, aged 47. He took the name &quot;Phra Chom Klao&quot;, although foreigners continued to call him King Mongkut. The king was well known among the foreigners, particularly some British officers, as pro-British. Sir James Brooke, a British delegate, even praised him as &quot;our own king&quot;, and showed his support of him as a new king of Siam. Having been celibate for 27 years, he now set about building the biggest royal family of the Chakri dynasty. Inside the palace there was a large number of women—reports say three thousand or more. They were mostly servants, guards, officials, maids and so on, but Mongkut acquired 32 wives, and by the time he died, aged 64, he had 82 children.
His awareness of possibility of an outbreak of war with the European powers led him to institute many innovative activities. He ordered the nobility to wear shirts while attending his court; this was to show that Siam was a &quot;modern&quot; nation from the Western point of view.

However, Mongkut&#x27;s own astrological calculations pointed out that his brother, Prince Isaret, was as well-favored as himself to be the monarch. So, Mongkut then crowned his brother as King Pinklao, the second king. As a prince, Pinklao was known for his abilities in foreign languages and relations. Mongkut also raised his supporter Dit Bunnag to &quot;Somdet Chao Phraya&quot; Borom Maha Prayurawongse (&quot;Somdet Chao Phraya&quot; was the highest rank of nobility on a par with royalty) and made him his regent kingdom-wide. Mongkut also appointed Dit Bunnag&#x27;s brother, Tat Bunnag, as &quot;Somdet Chao Phraya&quot; Borom Maha Pichaiyat, as his regent in Bangkok. As a result, the administrative power of Siam rested largely in the hands of the two Bunnags, Dit and Tat.

Upon his coronation, Mongkut married his first wife, Queen Somanass. However, Queen Somanass died in the same year. He then married his half-grandniece, &quot;Mom Chao&quot; Rampoei Siriwongse, later Queen Debsirindra.

==Shan campaigns==

In 1849, there were upheavals in the Shan State of Kengtung and Chiang Hung kingdom in response to weakened Burmese influence. However, the two states then fought each other and Chiang Hung sought Siamese support. Nangklao saw this as an opportunity to gain control over Shan states but he died in 1851 before this plan was realized. In 1852, Chiang Hung submitted the request again. Mongkut sent Siamese troops northwards but the armies were turned aside by the mountainous highlands. In 1855 the Siamese marched again and reached Kengtungthough with even greater difficulty. They laid siege on Kengtung for 21 days. However, the resources of the Siamese army ran out and the army had to retreat.

==Cultural reforms==

===Introduction of Western geography===
Accompanying the influx of Western visitors to Siam was the notion of a round earth. By many Siamese, this was difficult to accept, particularly by religious standards, because Buddhist scripture described the earth as being flat. The &quot;Traiphum&quot;, which was a geo-astrological map created before the arrival of Westerners, described &quot;…a path between two mountain ranges through which the stars, planets, moon and sun pass.&quot; Religious scholars usually concluded that Buddhist scriptures &quot;…were meant to be taken literally only when it came to matters of spiritual truth; details of natural science are revealed figuratively and allegorically.&quot; 
Mongkut claimed to have abandoned the Traiphum cosmology before 1836. He claimed that he already knew of the round state of earth 15 years before the arrival of American missionaries, but the debate about Earth&#x27;s shape remained an issue for Siamese intellectuals throughout the 1800s.

===Education reforms===
During his reign, Mongkut urged his royal relatives to have &quot;a European-style education.&quot; The missionaries, as teachers, taught modern geography and astronomy, among other subjects. Six years after Mongkut&#x27;s death, the first Thai-language geography book was published in 1874, called &quot;Phumanithet&quot; by J.W. Van Dyke. However, geography was only taught in select schools, mainly those that were run by American missionaries with English programs for upper secondary students. Thongchai Winichakul argues that Mongkut&#x27;s efforts to popularize Western geography helped bring reform to education in Siam.

===Social changes===

1852 saw an influx of English and American missionaries into Siam as Mongkut hired them to teach the English language to the princes. He also hired Western mercenaries to train Siamese troops in Western style. In Bangkok, American Dan Beach Bradley had already reformed the printing system and then resumed the publishing of Siam&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Bangkok Recorder&quot;. However, the missionaries were not as successful when it came to making religious conversions.

In 1852, he ordered the nobles of the court to wear upper garments. Previously, Siamese nobles were forbidden to wear any shirts to prevent them from hiding any weapons in it and met the king bare-chested. The practice was criticized by Westerners and so Mongkut ended it.

However, Mongkut did not abandon the traditional culture of Siam. For Buddhism, Mongkut pioneered the rehabilitation of various temples. He also began the &quot;Magha Puja&quot; (มาฆบูชา) festival in the full moon of the third lunar month, to celebrate Buddha&#x27;s announcement of his main principles. He instigated the recompilation of Tripitaka in Siam according to Theravada traditions. He also formally established the Thammayut sect as a rightful branch of Theravada.

Mongkut also improved women&#x27;s rights in Siam. He released a large number of royal concubines to find their own husbands, in contrast to how his story has been dramatized. He banned forced marriages of all kinds and the selling of one&#x27;s wife to pay off a debt.

In contrast to the previous king, Nangklao, Mongkut did not see the importance of sending envoys to the Qing dynasty court, as the mission symbolised Siam&#x27;s subjection to the Qing emperors and because the Qing dynasty was then not so powerful as it had once been, as it was itself threatened by Western powers.

==Bowring Treaty==
In 1854, John Bowring, the governor of Hong Kong in the name of Queen Victoria, came to Siam to negotiate a treaty. For the first time Siam had to deal seriously with international laws. Prayurawongse negotiated on the behalf of the Siamese. The result was the Bowring Treaty between the two nations. The main principle of the treaty was to abolish the Royal Storage (พระคลังสินค้า), which since Ayutthaya&#x27;s times held the monopoly on foreign trade. The Royal Storage had been the source of Ayutthaya&#x27;s prosperity as it collected immense taxation on foreign traders, including the taxation according to the width of the galleon and the tithe. Western products had to go through a series of tax barriers to reach Siamese people.

The Europeans had been attempting to undo this monopoly for a long time but no serious measures had been taken. For Siamese people, trading with foreigners subjected them to severe punishment by the government. The taxation was partially reduced in the Burney Treaty. However, in the world of nineteenth-century liberalism, government control over trade was swiftly disappearing.

The abolition of such trade barriers replaced the previous system of Siamese commerce with free trade. Import taxation was reduced to 3% and could only be collected once. This was a blow to national revenue. However, this led to dramatic growth of commercial sectors as common people gained access to foreign trade. People rushed to acquire vast, previously empty fields to grow rice and the competition eventually resulted in the lands ending up in the hands of nobility.

The Bowring Treaty also had a legal impact. Due to the horror of the &quot;Nakorn Bala&quot; methods of torture in judicial proceedings, the British requested not to be tried under the Siamese system, securing a grant of extraterritoriality; British subjects in Siam were therefore subject only to British law, while the Siamese in Britain enjoyed no reciprocal privilege.

More treaties were then made with other powers, further undermining national revenue and legal rights. The Bowring treaty proved to be the economic and social revolution of Siam. Mongkut&#x27;s reign saw immense commercial activities in Siam for the first time, which led to the introduction of coinage in 1860. The first industries in Siam were rice milling and sugar production. Infrastructure was improved; there was a great deal of paving of roads and canal diggingfor transport and water reservoirs for plantations.

==Anna Leonowens==

In 1862, following a recommendation by Tan Kim Ching in Singapore, the court hired an English woman named Anna Leonowens, whose influence was later the subject of great Thai controversy. It is still debated how much this affected the worldview of one of his sons, Prince Chulalongkorn, who succeeded to the throne. Around 1870, Leonowens wrote a memoir of her time as teacher, “The English Governess at the Siamese Court.” Author Margaret Langdon took this work, and interviews with Leonowens&#x27; descendants, to fill out and create the more fictionalized account, &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, in 1944, which was adapted for films and a musical.

Her story would become the inspiration for the Hollywood movies &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; and &quot;Anna and the King&quot; as well as the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;The King and I&quot; and its subsequent film adaptation, which, because of their fictionalized historical references and perceived disrespectful treatment of King Mongkut, were initially banned in Thailand as the Thai government and people considered them to be lèse majesté. To clarify the historical record, well-known Thai intellectuals Seni and Kukrit Pramoj in 1948 wrote &quot;The King of Siam Speaks&quot;. The Pramoj brothers sent their manuscript to the American politician and diplomat Abbot Low Moffat (1901–1996), who drew on it for his 1961 biography, &quot;Mongkut the King of Siam&quot;. Moffat donated the Pramoj manuscript to the United States Library of Congress in 1961.

Anna claimed that her conversations with Prince Chulalongkorn about human freedom, and her relating to him the story of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, became the inspiration for his abolition of slavery almost 40 years later. Slavery in Thailand was sometimes a voluntary alternative for individuals to be rid of social and financial obligations. One could be punished for torturing slaves in Siam, and some slaves could buy their freedom. Some western scholars and observers have expressed the opinion that Siamese slaves were treated better than English servants.

==Death and legacy==
===The solar eclipse at Wakor===

During his monkhood, Mongkut studied both indigenous astrology and English texts on Western astronomy and mathematics, hence developing his skills in astronomical measurement. One way that he honed his mastery of astronomy, aside from the accurate prediction of the solar eclipse of 18 August 1868 (Wakor solar eclipse), was changing the official Buddhist calendar, &quot;which was seriously miscalculated and the times for auspicious moments were incorrect.&quot;

In 1868, he invited high-ranking European and Siamese officials to accompany him to Wakor village in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, south of Hua Hin, where the solar eclipse that was to occur on 18 August could be best viewed as a total eclipse. Sir Harry Ord, the British governor of the Straits Settlements from Singapore, was among those who were invited. King Mongkut predicted the solar eclipse, at (in his own words) &quot;East Greenwich longitude 99 degrees 42&#x27; and latitude North 11 degrees 39&#x27;.&quot; King Mongkut&#x27;s calculations proved accurate. When he made calculations on the Wakor solar eclipse that was to occur, he used the Thai system of measuring time (&quot;mong&quot; and &quot;baht&quot;), but he implemented the Western method of longitude and latitude when he determined where on Earth the eclipse would best be viewed. Upon returning from his journey to Wakor, he condemned the court astrologers &quot;for their...stupid statements because of their negligence of his detailed prediction and their inattention to measurement and calculation by modern instruments.&quot;

During the expedition, King Mongkut and Prince Chulalongkorn were infected with malaria. The king died six weeks later in the capital, and was succeeded by his son, who survived malaria.

It has been argued that the assimilation of Western geography and astronomy into 19th-century Siam &quot;proved that Siam equalled the West in terms of knowledge, and therefore the imperialists&#x27; claim that Siam was uncivilized and had to be colonized was unreasonable.&quot; This suggests that the Western form of these sciences may have saved Siam from actually being colonized by Western powers.

===Elephant story===
Contrary to popular belief, King Mongkut did not offer a herd of war elephants to the US president Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War for use against the Confederacy. He did, however, offer to send some domesticated elephants to US president James Buchanan, to use as beasts of burden and means of transportation. The royal letter of 14 February 1861, which was written before the Civil War had even started, took some time to arrive in Washington DC, and by the time it reached its destination, President Buchanan was no longer in office. Lincoln, who succeeded Buchanan, is said to have been asked what the elephants could be used for, and in reply he said that he did not know, unless &quot;they were used to stamp out the rebellion.&quot; However, in his reply dated 3 February 1862, Lincoln did not mention anything about the Civil War. The President merely politely declined to accept King Mongkut&#x27;s proposal, explaining to the King that the American climate might not be suitable for elephants and that American steam engines could also be used as beasts of burden and means of transportation.

A century later, during his state visit to the US, King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who was Mongkut&#x27;s great-grandson, referred to this event in his address before the US Congress on 29 June 1960. He said, &quot;my great-grandfather offered to send the President and Congress elephants to be turned loose in the uncultivated land of America for breeding purposes. That offer was made with no other objective than to provide a friend with what he lacks, in the same spirit in which the American aid program is likewise offered.&quot;

===151834 Mongkut===
The asteroid 151834 Mongkut is named in honour of the King and his contributions to astronomy and the modernization of Siam.

==Tributes and legacy==

The main hospital of Phetchaburi province, Phrachomklao Hospital, is named after the King.

==Family==

King Mongkut is one of the people with the most children in Thai history; he had 32 wives and concubines during his lifetime who produced at least 82 children, one of whom was Chulalongkorn, who married four of his half sisters.

<text>Neuschwanstein Castle (, ; ) is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill of the foothills of the Alps in the very south of Germany, near the border with Austria. It is located in the Swabia region of Bavaria, in the municipality of Schwangau, above the incorporated village of Hohenschwangau, which is also the location of Hohenschwangau Castle. The closest larger town is Füssen. The castle stands above the narrow gorge of the Pöllat stream, east of the Alpsee and Schwansee lakes, close to the mouth of the Lech into Forggensee.

Despite the main residence of the Bavarian monarchs at the time—the Munich Residenz—being one of the most extensive palace complexes in the world, King Ludwig II of Bavaria felt the need to escape from the constraints he saw himself exposed to in Munich, and commissioned Neuschwanstein Palace on the remote northern edges of the Alps as a retreat but also in honour of composer Richard Wagner, whom he greatly admired.

Ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing rather than Bavarian public funds. Construction began in 1869 but was never completed. The castle was intended to serve as a private residence for the king but he died in 1886, and it was opened to the public shortly after his death. Since then, more than 61 million people have visited Neuschwanstein Castle. More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with as many as 6,000 per day in the summer.

==Location==

The municipality of Schwangau lies at an elevation of at the southwest border of the German state of Bavaria. Its surroundings are characterised by the transition between the Alpine foothills in the south (toward the nearby Austrian border) and a hilly landscape in the north that appears flat by comparison. In the Middle Ages, three castles overlooked the villages. One was called Schwanstein Castle. In 1832, Ludwig&#x27;s father, King Maximilian II of Bavaria, bought its ruins to replace them with the comfortable neo-Gothic palace known as Hohenschwangau Castle. Finished in 1837, the palace became his family&#x27;s summer residence, and his elder son Ludwig (born 1845) spent a large part of his childhood here.

Vorderhohenschwangau Castle and Hinterhohenschwangau Castle sat on a rugged hill overlooking Schwanstein Castle, two nearby lakes (Alpsee and Schwansee), and the village. Separated by only a moat, they jointly consisted of a hall, a keep, and a fortified tower house. In the 19th century, only ruins remained of the twin medieval castles; those of Hinterhohenschwangau served as a lookout place known as &quot;Sylphenturm&quot;.

The ruins above the family palace were known to the crown prince from his excursions. He first sketched one of them in his diary in 1859. When the young king came to power in 1864, the construction of a new palace in place of the two ruined castles became the first in his series of palace building projects. As he called the new palace New &quot;Hohenschwangau&quot; Castle, the confusing result was that Hohenschwangau and Schwanstein effectively swapped names: Hohenschwangau Castle replaced the ruins of Schwanstein Castle, and Neuschwanstein Castle replaced the ruins of the two Hohenschwangau Castles. Only after Ludwig&#x27;s death was it renamed &quot;Neuschwanstein&quot;.

==History==
===Inspiration and design===
Neuschwanstein embodies both the contemporaneous architectural fashion known as castle Romanticism () and King Ludwig II&#x27;s enthusiasm for the operas of Richard Wagner. In the 19th century, many castles were constructed or reconstructed, often with significant changes, to make them more picturesque. Palace-building projects similar to Neuschwanstein had been undertaken earlier in several of the German states and included Hohenschwangau Castle, Lichtenstein Castle, Hohenzollern Castle, and numerous buildings on the Rhine, such as Stolzenfels Castle. The inspiration for the construction of Neuschwanstein came from two journeys that Ludwig took in 1867: one in May to the reconstructed Wartburg near Eisenach, and another in July to the Château de Pierrefonds, which Eugène Viollet-le-Duc was transforming from a ruined castle into a historicist palace.

Ludwig believed both buildings represented a Romanticist interpretation of the Middle Ages, as well as the musical mythology of his friend Wagner, whose operas &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; had made a lasting impression on him. In February 1868, Ludwig&#x27;s grandfather, King Ludwig I, died, freeing the considerable sums that were previously spent on the abdicated King&#x27;s appanage. This allowed Ludwig II to start the architectural project of building a private refuge in the familiar landscape far from the capital Munich, so that he could live out his idea of the Middle Ages. In a letter to Richard Wagner in May 1868, Ludwig wrote:

The building design was drafted by the stage designer Christian Jank and realised by the architect Eduard Riedel. For technical reasons, the ruined castles could not be integrated into the plan. Initial ideas for the palace drew stylistically on Nuremberg Castle and envisaged a simple building in place of the old Vorderhohenschwangau Castle, but they were rejected and replaced by increasingly extensive drafts, culminating in a bigger palace modelled on the Wartburg. The king insisted on a detailed plan and on personal approval of each and every draft. Ludwig&#x27;s control went so far that the palace has been regarded as his own creation rather than that of the architects involved. Whereas contemporary architecture critics derided Neuschwanstein, one of the last big palace building projects of the 19th century, as kitsch, Neuschwanstein and Ludwig II&#x27;s other buildings are now counted among the major works of European historicism. For financial reasons, a project similar to Neuschwanstein — Falkenstein Castle — never got past the planning stages.

The palace can be regarded as typical of 19th-century architecture. The shapes of Romanesque (simple geometric figures such as cuboids and semicircular arches), Gothic (upward-pointing lines, slim towers, delicate embellishments), and Byzantine architecture and art (the Throne Hall décor) were mingled in an eclectic fashion and supplemented with 19th-century technical achievements. The &quot;Patrona Bavariae&quot; and Saint George on the court face of the (main building) are depicted in the local &quot;Lüftlmalerei&quot; style, a fresco technique typical for Allgäu farmers&#x27; houses, while the unimplemented drafts for the Knights&#x27; House gallery foreshadow elements of Art Nouveau. Characteristic of Neuschwanstein&#x27;s design are theatre themes: Christian Jank drew on coulisse drafts from his time as a scenic painter. The basic style was first planned to be neo-Gothic but the palace was primarily built in Romanesque style in the end. The operatic themes moved gradually from &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; to &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

===Construction===


In 1868, the ruins of the medieval twin castles were completely demolished; the remains of the old keep were blown up. The foundation stone for the palace was laid on 5 September 1869; in 1872, its cellar was completed, and in 1876, everything up to the first floor, the gatehouse being finished first. At the end of 1882, it was completed and fully furnished, allowing Ludwig to take provisional lodgings there and observe the ongoing construction work. In 1874, management of the civil works passed from Eduard Riedel to Georg von Dollmann. The topping out ceremony for the was in 1880, and in 1884 the King moved in to the new building. In the same year, the direction of the project passed to , after Dollmann had fallen from the King&#x27;s favour. The palace was erected as a conventional brick construction and later encased in various types of rock. The white limestone used for the fronts came from a nearby quarry.

The sandstone bricks for the portals and bay windows came from Schlaitdorf in Württemberg. Marble from Untersberg near Salzburg was used for the windows, the arch ribs, the columns and the capitals. The Throne Hall was a later addition to the plans and required a steel framework. The transport of building materials was facilitated by scaffolding and a steam crane that lifted the material to the construction site. Another crane was used at the construction site. The recently founded Dampfkessel-Revisionsverein (Steam Boiler Inspection Association) regularly inspected both boilers.

For about two decades, the construction site was the principal employer in the region. In 1880, about 200 craftsmen were occupied at the site, not counting suppliers and other persons indirectly involved in the construction. At times when the King insisted on particularly close deadlines and urgent changes, reportedly up to 300 workers per day were active, sometimes working at night by the light of oil lamps. Statistics from the years 1879/1880 support an immense amount of building materials: of Salzburg marble, of sandstone, 400,000 bricks and of wood for the scaffolding. In 1870, a society was founded for insuring the workers, for a low monthly fee, augmented by the King. The heirs of construction casualties (30 cases are mentioned in the statistics) received a small pension.

In 1884, the King moved into the (still unfinished) &#x27;, and in 1885 he invited his mother Marie to Neuschwanstein on the occasion of her 60th birthday. By 1886, the external structure of the &#x27; (hall) was mostly finished. In the same year, Ludwig had the first, wooden &quot;Marienbrücke&quot; over the Pöllat Gorge replaced by a steel construction.

Despite its size, Neuschwanstein did not have space for the royal court but contained only the King&#x27;s private lodging and servants&#x27; rooms. The court buildings served decorative rather than residential purposes: The palace was intended to serve King Ludwig II as a kind of inhabitable theatrical setting. As a &quot;temple of friendship&quot;, it was also dedicated to the life and work of Richard Wagner, who died in 1883 without visiting the building. In the end, Ludwig II lived in the palace for a total of only 172 days.

===Funding===

The King&#x27;s demands expanded during the construction of Neuschwanstein, and so did the expenses. Drafts and estimated costs were revised repeatedly. Initially a modest study was planned instead of the great throne hall, and projected guest rooms were struck from the drafts to make place for a &quot;Moorish Hall&quot;, which could not be realised due to lack of resources. Completion was originally projected for 1872 but repeatedly deferred.

Neuschwanstein, the symbolic medieval knight&#x27;s castle, was not King Ludwig II&#x27;s only huge construction project. It was followed by the Rococo style Lustschloss of Linderhof Palace and the Baroque palace of Herrenchiemsee, a monument to the era of absolutism. Linderhof, the smallest of the projects, was finished in 1886, and the other two remain incomplete. All three projects together drained his resources. The King paid for his construction projects by private means and from his civil list income. Contrary to frequent claims, the Bavarian treasury was not directly burdened by his buildings. From 1871, Ludwig had an additional secret income in return for a political favour given to Otto von Bismarck.

The construction costs of Neuschwanstein in the King&#x27;s lifetime amounted to 6.2 million German gold marks (equivalent to € million in ), almost twice the initial cost estimate of 3.2 million marks. As his private means were insufficient for his increasingly escalating construction projects, the King continuously opened new lines of credit. In 1876, a court counselor was replaced after pointing out the danger of insolvency. By 1883, he already owed 7 million marks, and in spring 1884 and August 1885 debt conversions of 7.5 million marks and 6.5 million marks, respectively, became necessary.

Even after his debts had reached 14 million marks, King Ludwig II insisted on continuation of his architectural projects; he threatened suicide if his creditors seized his palaces. In early 1886, Ludwig asked his cabinet for a credit of 6 million marks, which was denied. In April, he followed Bismarck&#x27;s advice to apply for the money to his parliament. In June, the Bavarian government decided to depose the King who was living at Neuschwanstein at the time. On 9 June, he was incapacitated and on 10 June, he had the deposition commission arrested in the gatehouse. In expectation of the commission, he alerted the gendarmerie and fire brigades of surrounding places for his protection. A second commission headed by Bernhard von Gudden arrived on the next day, and the King was forced to leave the palace that night. Ludwig was put under the supervision of Gudden. On 13 June, both died under mysterious circumstances in the shallow shore water of Lake Starnberg near Berg Castle.

===Simplified completion===

At the time of King Ludwig&#x27;s death, the palace was far from complete. The external structures of the Gatehouse and the were mostly finished but the Rectangular Tower was still scaffolded. Work on the Bower had not started but was completed in a simplified form by 1892 without the planned figures of the female saints. The Knights&#x27; House was also simplified. In King Ludwig&#x27;s plans, the columns in the Knights&#x27; House gallery were held as tree trunks and the capitals as the corresponding crowns. Only the foundations existed for the core piece of the palace complex: a keep of height planned in the upper courtyard, resting on a three-nave chapel. This was not realised, and a connection wing between the Gatehouse and the Bower saw the same fate. Plans for a castle garden with terraces and a fountain west of the were also abandoned after the King&#x27;s death.

The interior of the royal living space in the palace was mostly completed in 1886; the lobbies and corridors were painted in a simpler style by 1888. The &quot;Moorish Hall&quot;, which was desired by the King and planned below the Throne Hall, was not realised any more than the &quot;Knights&#x27; Bath&quot;, which was modelled after the Knights&#x27; Bath in the Wartburg and was intended to render homage to the knights&#x27; cult as a medieval baptism bath. A &quot;Bride Chamber&quot; in the Bower (after a location in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;), guest rooms in the first and second floor of the and a great banquet hall were further abandoned projects. In fact, a complete development of Neuschwanstein had never even been planned, and at the time of the King&#x27;s death there was not a utilisation concept for numerous rooms.

The King never intended to make the palace accessible to the public. No more than six weeks after the King&#x27;s death, the Prince-Regent Luitpold ordered the palace opened to paying visitors. The administrators of King Ludwig&#x27;s estate managed to balance the construction debts by 1899. From then until World War I, Neuschwanstein was a stable and lucrative source of revenue for the House of Wittelsbach, and King Ludwig&#x27;s castles were probably the single largest income source earned by the Bavarian royal family in the last years prior to 1914. To guarantee a smooth course of visits, some rooms and the court buildings were finished first. Initially, the visitors were allowed to move freely in the palace, causing the furniture to wear quickly.

When Bavaria became a republic in 1918, the government socialised the civil list. The resulting dispute with the House of Wittelsbach led to a split in 1923: King Ludwig&#x27;s palaces including Neuschwanstein fell to the state and are now managed by the Bavarian Palace Department, a division of the Bavarian finance ministry. Nearby Hohenschwangau Castle fell to the (&quot;Wittelsbacher Ausgleichsfonds&quot;), whose revenues go to the House of Wittelsbach. The visitor numbers continued to rise, reaching 200,000 in 1939.

===World War II===

Due to its secluded and strategically unimportant location, the palace survived the destruction of the two World Wars. Until 1944, it served as a depot for Nazi plunder that was taken from France by the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories (&quot;&quot;), a suborganisation of the Nazi Party. The castle was used to catalogue the works of art. After World War II, 39 photo albums were found in the palace documenting the scale of the art seizures. The albums are now stored in the United States National Archives.
In April 1945, the SS considered blowing up the palace to prevent the building and the artwork it contained from falling to the enemy. The plan was not realised by the SS-&quot;&quot; who had been assigned the task, and at the end of the war the palace was surrendered undamaged to representatives of the Allied forces. The Allied occupation authorities eventually returned the palace to the reconstituted Bavarian state government. Thereafter the Bavarian archives used some of the rooms as a provisional store for salvaged archival material, as its premises in Munich had been bombed.

==Architecture==
The effect of the Neuschwanstein ensemble is highly stylistic, both externally and internally. The king&#x27;s influence is apparent throughout, and he took a keen personal interest in the design and decoration. An example can be seen in his comments, or commands, regarding a mural depicting Lohengrin in the : &quot;His Majesty wishes that ... the ship be placed further from the shore, that Lohengrin&#x27;s neck be less tilted, that the chain from the ship to the swan be of gold and not of roses, and finally that the style of the castle shall be kept medieval.&quot;

The suite of rooms within the contains the Throne Room, King Ludwig&#x27;s suite, the Singers&#x27; Hall, and the Grotto. The interior and especially the throne room Byzantine-Arab construction resumes to the chapels and churches of the royal Sicilian Norman-Swabian period in Palermo related to the Kings of Germany House of Hohenstaufen. Throughout, the design pays homage to the German legends of Lohengrin, the Swan Knight. Hohenschwangau, where King Ludwig spent much of his youth, had decorations of these sagas. These themes were taken up in the operas of Richard Wagner. Many rooms bear a border depicting the various operas written by Wagner, including a theatre permanently featuring the set of one such play. Many of the interior rooms remain undecorated, with only 14 rooms finished before Ludwig&#x27;s death. With the palace under construction at the King&#x27;s death, one of the major features of the palace remained unbuilt. A massive keep, which would have formed the highest point and central focus of the ensemble, was planned for the middle of the upper courtyard but was never built, at the decision of the King&#x27;s family. The foundation for the keep is visible in the upper courtyard.

Neuschwanstein Castle consists of several individual structures which were erected over a length of 150 metres on the top of a cliff ridge. The elongate building is furnished with numerous towers, ornamental turrets, gables, balconies, pinnacles, and sculptures. Following Romanesque style, most window openings are fashioned as bi- and triforia. Before the backdrop of the Tegelberg and the Pöllat Gorge in the south and the Alpine foothills with their lakes in the north, the ensemble of individual buildings provides varying picturesque views of the palace from all directions. It was designed as the Romantic ideal of a knight&#x27;s castle. Unlike real castles, whose building stock is in most cases the result of centuries of building activity, Neuschwanstein was planned from the inception as an intentionally asymmetric building, and erected in consecutive stages. Typical attributes of a castle were included, but real fortifications — the most important feature of a medieval aristocratic estate — were dispensed with.

===Exterior===


The palace complex is entered through the symmetrical Gatehouse flanked by two stair towers. The eastward-pointing gate building is the only structure of the palace whose wall area is fashioned in high-contrast colours; the exterior walls are cased with red bricks, the court fronts with yellow limestone. The roof cornice is surrounded by pinnacles. The upper floor of the Gatehouse is surmounted by a crow-stepped gable and held King Ludwig II&#x27;s first lodging at Neuschwanstein, from which he occasionally observed the building work before the hall was completed. The ground floors of the Gatehouse were intended to accommodate the stables.

The passage through the Gatehouse, crowned with the royal coat of arms of Bavaria, leads directly into the courtyard. The courtyard has two levels, the lower one being defined to the east by the Gatehouse and to the north by the foundations of the Rectangular Tower and by the gallery building. The southern end of the courtyard is open, imparting a view of the surrounding mountain scenery. At its western end, the courtyard is delimited by a bricked embankment, whose polygonally protracting bulge marks the choir of the originally projected chapel; this three-nave church, never built, was intended to form the base of a 90-metre (295-ft) keep, the planned centrepiece of the architectural ensemble. A flight of steps at the side gives access to the upper level.

Today, the foundation plan of the chapel-keep is marked out in the upper-courtyard pavement. The most striking structure of the upper court level is the Rectangular Tower (45 metres or 148 feet). Like most of the court buildings, it mostly serves a decorative purpose as part of the ensemble. Its viewing platform provides a vast view over the Alpine foothills to the north. The northern end of the upper courtyard is defined by the Knights&#x27; House. The three-storey building is connected to the Rectangular Tower and the Gatehouse by means of a continuous gallery fashioned with a blind arcade. From the point of view of castle Romanticism, the Knights&#x27; House was the abode of a stronghold&#x27;s menfolk; at Neuschwanstein, estate and service rooms were envisioned here. The Bower, which complements the Knights&#x27; House as the ladies&#x27; house but was never used as such, defines the south side of the courtyard. Both structures together form the motif of the &quot;Antwerp Castle&quot; featuring in the first act of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. Embedded in the pavement is the floor plan of the planned palace chapel.

The western end of the courtyard is delimited by the &quot;&quot; (hall). It constitutes the real main and residential building of the castle and contains the King&#x27;s stateroom and the servants&#x27; rooms. The is a colossal five-story structure in the shape of two huge cuboids that are connected in a flat angle and covered by two adjacent high gable roofs. The building&#x27;s shape follows the course of the ridge. In its angles there are two stair towers, the northern one surmounting the palace roof by several storeys with its height of 65 metres (213 ft). With their polymorphic roofs, both towers are reminiscent of the Château de Pierrefonds. The western front supports a two-storey balcony with view on the Alpsee, while northwards a low chair tower and the conservatory protract from the main structure. The entire is spangled with numerous decorative chimneys and ornamental turrets, the court front with colourful frescos. The court-side gable is crowned with a copper lion, the western (outward) gable with the likeness of a knight.

===Interior===


Had it been completed, the palace would have had more than 200 interior rooms, including premises for guests and servants, as well as for service and logistics. Ultimately, no more than about 15 rooms and halls were finished. In its lower stories the accommodates administrative and servants&#x27; rooms and the rooms of today&#x27;s palace administration. The King&#x27;s staterooms are situated in the upper stories. The anterior structure accommodates the lodgings in the third floor, above them the &quot;Hall of the Singers&quot;. The upper floors of the west-facing posterior structure are filled almost completely by the Throne Hall. The total floor space of all floors amounts to nearly .

Neuschwanstein houses numerous significant interior rooms of German historicism. The palace was fitted with several of the latest technical innovations of the late 19th century. Among other things, it had a battery-powered bell system for the servants and telephone lines. The kitchen equipment included a Rumford oven that turned the skewer with its heat and so automatically adjusted the turning speed. The hot air was used for a calorifère central heating system. Further novelties for the era were running warm water and toilets with automatic flushing.

The largest room of the palace by area is the Hall of the Singers, followed by the Throne Hall. The Hall of the Singers is located in the eastern, court-side wing of the , in the fourth floor above the King&#x27;s lodgings. It is designed as an amalgamation of two rooms of the Wartburg: The Hall of the Singers and the Ballroom. It was one of the King&#x27;s favourite projects for his palace. The rectangular room was decorated with themes from Lohengrin and Parzival. Its longer side is terminated by a gallery that is crowned by a tribune, modelled after the Wartburg. The eastern narrow side is terminated by a stage that is structured by arcades and known as the &quot;Sängerlaube&quot;. The Hall of the Singers was never designed for court festivities of the reclusive King. Rather, like the Throne Hall, it served as a walkable monument in which the culture of knights and courtly love of the Middle Ages was represented. The first performance in this hall took place in 1933, and was a concert commemorating the 50th anniversary of Richard Wagner&#x27;s death.

The Throne Hall, , is situated in the west wing of the . With its height of , it occupies the third and fourth floors. Julius Hofmann modelled it after the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche in the Munich Residenz. On three sides, it is surrounded by colorful arcades, ending in an apse that was intended to hold King Ludwig&#x27;s throne but that was never completed. The throne dais is surrounded by paintings of Jesus, the Twelve Apostles, and six canonised kings. The mural paintings were created by Wilhelm Hauschild. The floor mosaic was completed after the king&#x27;s death. The chandelier is fashioned after a Byzantine crown. The Throne Hall makes a sacral impression. Following the king&#x27;s wish, it amalgamated the Grail Hall from Parzival with a symbol of the divine right of kings, an incorporation of unrestricted sovereign power, which King Ludwig as the head of a constitutional monarchy no longer held. The union of the sacral and regal is emphasised by the portraits in the apse of six canonised Kings: Saint Louis of France, Saint Stephen of Hungary, Saint Edward the Confessor of England, Saint Wenceslaus of Bohemia, Saint Olaf of Norway, and Saint Henry, Holy Roman Emperor.

Apart from the large ceremonial rooms, several smaller rooms were created for use by King Ludwig II. The royal lodging is on the third floor of the palace in the east wing of the . It consists of eight rooms with living space and several smaller rooms. In spite of the gaudy décor, the living space with its moderate room size and its sofas and suites makes a relatively modern impression on today&#x27;s visitors. King Ludwig II did not attach importance to representative requirements of former times, in which the life of a monarch was mostly public. The interior decoration with mural paintings, tapestry, furniture and other handicraft generally refers to the King&#x27;s favourite themes: the grail legend, the works of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and their interpretation by Richard Wagner.

The eastward drawing room is adorned with themes from the Lohengrin legend. The furniture, including sofa, table, armchairs, and seats in a northward alcove, is comfortable and homelike. Next to the drawing room is a little artificial grotto that forms the passage to the study. The unusual room, originally equipped with an artificial waterfall and a rainbow machine, is connected to a little conservatory. Depicting the Hörselberg grotto, it relates to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, as does the décor of the adjacent study. In the park of Linderhof Palace the King had installed a similar grotto of greater dimensions. Opposite the study follows the dining room, adorned with themes of courtly love. Since the kitchen in Neuschwanstein is situated three stories below the dining room, it was impossible to install a wishing table (dining table disappearing by means of a mechanism) as at Linderhof Palace and Herrenchiemsee. Instead, the dining room was connected with the kitchen by means of a service lift.

The bedroom adjacent to the dining room and the subsequent house chapel are the only rooms of the palace that remain in neo-Gothic style. The King&#x27;s bedroom is dominated by a huge bed adorned with carvings. Fourteen carvers worked more than four years on the bed canopy with its numerous pinnacles and on the oaken panellings. It was in this room that Ludwig was arrested on the night between 11 and 12 June 1886. The adjacent little house chapel is consecrated to Saint Louis, after whom the owner was named.

The servant rooms are in the basement of the , and are quite scantily equipped with massive oak furniture. Besides one table and one cabinet, there are two beds of length each. Translucent glass windows separated the rooms from the corridor that connects the exterior stairs with the main stairs, so that the King could enter and leave unseen. The servants were not allowed to use the main stairs but were restricted to the much narrower and steeper servants&#x27; stairs.

==Tourism==
Neuschwanstein welcomes almost 1.5 million visitors per year, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe. For security reasons, the palace can only be visited via a 35-minute guided tour, and no photography is allowed inside the castle. There are also special guided tours that focus on specific topics. In the peak season from June until August, Neuschwanstein has as many as 6,000 visitors per day, and guests without advance reservation may have to wait several hours. Those without tickets may still walk the long driveway from the base to the top of the mountain and visit the grounds and courtyard without a ticket, but they will not be admitted to the interior of the castle. Ticket sales are processed exclusively via the ticket centre in Hohenschwangau. , the total number of visitors exceeded 60 million. In 2004, the revenues were booked as €6.5 million.

On June 14, 2023, two young American tourists were assaulted by a 30-year old American near Marienbrücke, killing one of them.

==Culture, art, and science==
Neuschwanstein is a global symbol of the era of Romanticism. The palace has appeared prominently in several movies such as Helmut Käutner&#x27;s &quot;Ludwig II&quot; (1955) and Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Ludwig&quot; (1972), both biopics about the King; the musical &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), the spoof comedy &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, and the war drama &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963). It served as the inspiration for Disneyland&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty Castle, Cameran Palace in the animated Pokémon film &quot;Lucario and The Mystery of Mew&quot; (2005), and later similar structures. It is also visited by the character Grace Nakimura alongside Herrenchiemsee in the game &quot;The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery&quot; (1996).

In 1977, Neuschwanstein Castle became the motif of a West German definitive stamp, and it appeared on a €2 commemorative coin for the German series in 2012. In 2007, it was a finalist in the widely publicised online selection of the New Seven Wonders of the World. A meteorite that reached Earth spectacularly on 6 April 2002 at the Austrian border near Hohenschwangau was named &quot;Neuschwanstein&quot; after the palace. Three fragments were found: &quot;Neuschwanstein I&quot; (, found July 2002) and &quot;Neuschwanstein II&quot; (, found May 2003) on the German side, and &quot;Neuschwanstein III&quot; (, found June 2003) on the Austrian side near Reutte. The meteorite is classified as an enstatite chondrite with unusually large proportions of pure iron (29%), enstatite, and the extremely rare mineral sinoite (Si2N2O).

===World Heritage candidature===

, Neuschwanstein and Ludwig&#x27;s Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee palaces are on the German tentative list for a future designation as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. A joint candidature with other representative palaces of the Romantic historicism is discussed, including for example Schwerin Palace.

<text>The ulnar nerve is a nerve that runs near the ulna, one of the two long bones in the forearm. The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve. The nerve is the largest in the human body unprotected by muscle or bone, so injury is common. This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, innervating the palmar aspect of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds.

This nerve can cause an electric shock-like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed. The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point. This is commonly referred to as bumping one&#x27;s &quot;funny bone&quot;. This name is thought to be a pun, based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm, the humerus, and the word &quot;humorous&quot;. Alternatively, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it may refer to &quot;the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck&quot;.

==Structure==
===Arm===
The ulnar nerve originates from the C8-T1 nerve roots (and occasionally carries C7 fibers which arise from the lateral cord), which then form part of the medial cord of the brachial plexus, and descends medial to the brachial artery, up until the insertion point of coracobrachialis muscle (middle 5 cm over the medial border of the humerus). Then, it pierces the medial intermuscular septum and enters the posterior compartment of the arm, accompanied by superior ulnar collateral vessels. It runs at the posteromedial aspects of the humerus, passing behind the medial epicondyle (in the cubital tunnel) at the elbow, where it can be palpated by hand.

===Forearm===
The ulnar nerve is not a content of the cubital fossa. It enters the anterior (flexor) compartment of the forearm between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris, and lies along the lateral border of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The ulnar nerve runs between the flexor digitorum superficialis (laterally) and flexor digitorum profundus medially. Near the wrist, it courses superficial to the flexor retinaculum of hand, but covered by volar carpal ligament to enter the hand.

In the forearm it gives off the following branches:
* Muscular branches of ulnar nerve - supplies one and a half muscles (flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus)
* Palmar branch of ulnar nerve - arises from the middle part of the forearm and supplies the skin over the hypothenar eminence.
* Dorsal branch of ulnar nerve - arises from 7.5 cm above the wrist, winds backwards to supply the skin of the proximal part of the ulnar one and half fingers and the adjoining area between the fingers.
* Articular branches are given off to the elbow joint.

===Hand===
Ulnar nerve enters the palm of the hand via the Guyon&#x27;s canal, superficial to the flexor retinaculum and lateral to the pisiform bone.

Here it gives off the following branches:
* Superficial branch of ulnar nerve - supplies the palmaris brevis and gives digital branches to the medial one and a half fingers.
* Deep branch of ulnar nerve - It accompanies the deep branch of the ulnar artery. It passes backwards between the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, and opponens digiti minimi, supplying all the three muscles, and lying on the hook of hamate bone. It then turns laterally, supplying the 3rd and 4th lumbricals and all the palmar interossei muscles and dorsal interossei of the hand. It terminates by supplying the adductor pollicis.
* Articular branches to the wrist.

==Function==

Ulnar nerve is also known as &quot;musician&#x27;s nerve&quot; as it controls the fine movements of the fingers.

===Sensory===
The ulnar nerve also provides sensory innervation to the fifth digit and the medial half of the fourth digit, and the corresponding part of the palm:
* Palmar branch of ulnar nerve - supplies cutaneous innervation to the anterior skin and nails
* Dorsal branch of ulnar nerve - supplies cutaneous innervation to the dorsal medial hand and the dorsum of the medial 1.5 fingers

===Motor===
The ulnar nerve and its branches innervate the following muscles in the forearm and hand:

*An articular branch that passes to the elbow joint while the ulnar nerve is passing between the olecranon and medial epicondyle of the humerus
*In the forearm, via the muscular branches of ulnar nerve:
**Flexor carpi ulnaris
**Flexor digitorum profundus (medial half)
*In the hand, via the deep branch of ulnar nerve:
**Hypothenar muscles
***Opponens digiti minimi
***Abductor digiti minimi 
***Flexor digiti minimi brevis 
**The third and fourth lumbrical muscles
**Dorsal interossei
**Palmar interossei
**Adductor pollicis
**Flexor pollicis brevis (deep head)
*In the hand, via the superficial branch of ulnar nerve:
**Palmaris brevis

==Clinical significance==

The ulnar nerve can suffer injury anywhere between its proximal origin of the brachial plexus all the way to its distal branches in the hand. It is the most commonly injured nerve around the elbow. Although it can be damaged under various circumstances, it is commonly injured by local trauma or physical impingement (&quot;pinched nerve&quot;). Injury of the ulnar nerve at different levels causes specific motor and sensory deficits.

===At the elbow===
* &quot;Common mechanisms of injury&quot;: Cubital tunnel syndrome, fracture of the medial epicondyle of the humerus (causing direct ulnar nerve injury), fracture of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus (causing cubitus valgus with tardy ulnar nerve palsy), Driver&#x27;s Elbow
* &quot;Motor deficit&quot;: 
** Weakness in flexion of the hand at the wrist, loss of flexion of ulnar half of digits, or the 4th and 5th digits, loss of ability to cross the digits of the hand. (Note: Motor deficit is absent or very minor in cubital tunnel syndrome as the ulnar nerve is compressed in the cubital tunnel, rather than transected.)
** Presence of a claw hand deformity when the hand is at rest, due to hyperextension of the 4th and 5th digits at the metacarpophalangeal joints, and flexion at the interphalangeal joints. 
** Weakness of adduction of the thumb, which may be assessed by the presence of Froment&#x27;s sign.
* &quot;Sensory deficit&quot;: Loss of sensation or paresthesiae in ulnar half of the palm and dorsum of hand, and the medial 1½ digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand

===At the wrist===
* &quot;Common mechanism&quot;: penetrating wounds, Guyon canal cyst (and other lesions)
* &quot;Motor deficit&quot;: 
** Loss of flexion of ulnar half of digits, or the 4th and 5th digits, loss of ability to cross the digits of the hand. 
** Presence of a claw hand deformity when the hand is at rest, due to hyperextension of the 4th and 5th digits at the metacarpophalangeal joints, and flexion at the interphalangeal joints. 
** The claw hand deformity is more prominent with injury at the wrist as opposed to a lesion higher up in the arm, for instance, at the elbow, as the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus is not affected. This pulls the distal interphalangeal joints of the 4th and 5th digit into a more flexed position, producing a more deformed &#x27;claw&#x27;. This is known as the ulnar paradox.
** Weakness of adduction of the thumb, which may be assessed by the presence of Froment&#x27;s sign.
* &quot;Sensory deficit&quot;: Loss of sensation or paresthesiae in ulnar half of the palm, and the medial 1½ digits on the palmar aspect of the hand, with dorsal sparing. The dorsal aspect of the hand is unaffected as the posterior cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve is given off higher up in the forearm and does not reach the wrist.
In severe cases, surgery may be performed to relocate or &quot;release&quot; the nerve to prevent further injury.

<text>The blue shark (Prionace glauca), also known as the great blue shark, is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae and the only member of its genus which inhabits deep waters in the world&#x27;s temperate and tropical oceans. Averaging around and preferring cooler waters, the blue shark migrates long distances, such as from New England to South America. It is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

Although generally lethargic, they can move very quickly. Blue sharks are viviparous and are noted for large litters of 25 to over 100 pups. They feed primarily on small fish and squid, although they can take larger prey. Some of the blue shark’s predators include the killer whale and larger sharks like tiger sharks and the great white shark. Maximum lifespan is still unknown, but it is believed that they can live up to 20 years. They are one of the most abundant pelagic sharks, with large numbers being caught by fisheries as bycatch on longlines and nets. 

==Anatomy and appearance==
Blue sharks are light-bodied with long pectoral fins. Like many other sharks, blue sharks are countershaded: the top of the body is deep blue, lighter on the sides, and the underside is white. The male blue shark commonly grows to at maturity, whereas the larger females commonly grow to at maturity. Large specimens can grow to long. Occasionally, an outsized blue shark is reported, with one widely printed claim of a length of , but no shark even approaching this size has been scientifically documented. The blue shark is fairly elongated and slender in build and typically weighs from in males and from in large females. Occasionally, a female in excess of will weigh over . The heaviest reported weight for the species was . However, anecdotal claims exist for the species to exceptionally reach in weight, though these are not verified. The blue shark is also ectothermic and it has a unique sense of smell. 

==Sensory==
The five senses that blue sharks share with other members of the Carcharhinidae family is vision, hearing, lateral line, chemoreception, and electroreception. These senses allow them to perceive and react to a variety of biotic and/or abiotic stimuli in their immediate environment and across a different range of spatial scales.

The well-developed eyes of blue sharks exhibit interspecific variations in their eye structure, which are characteristic of adaptations for vision in a variety of light environments, from the brightly lit surface waters to the darkness of the deep sea. The lateral position of the eyes in the head allows a cyclopean visual field of 360° in the vertical plane and between 308° and 338° in the horizontal plane.

The morphology of the inner ears of blue sharks is similar to that of other gnathostomes. It consists of a membranous labyrinth that is made up of three semicircular canals that are filled with fluid and arranged orthogonally, as well as three otolithic organs, which are the sacculus, utriculus, and lagena. These sharks are most sensitive to frequencies below roughly 100 Hz, but they can hear sounds up to roughly 1000 Hz.

The blue shark&#x27;s lateral line is a mechanosensory structure that can detect particle motion. As such, it can react to mechanical disturbances caused by hydrodynamic stimuli that are not auditory. It is used to determine the direction and speed of water currents as well as the vibrations produced by prey, predators, and similar species moving through the water.

Blue sharks&#x27; chemosensory system is made up of gustation (taste), olfaction (smell), which is a common chemical sense. Functions like intraspecific social interactions, communication, reproduction, and food detection are all linked to smell. Gustation is mainly related to feeding and involves using taste buds to process food and assess its palatability through direct contact, which usually results in a decision to swallow or reject it.

Blue sharks can detect weak electrical potentials generated by objects and other animals through specialized receptors. These sharks use their electrical sense to locate and capture prey, as well as to avoid predators. As they move through the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, they may also sense the weak electrical fields produced by nearby water currents or their own bodies, which can aid in navigation and orientation.

The electroreceptors, known as the ampullae of Lorenzini, are of the ampullary type and develop from the lateral line placodes. Each ampulla consists of a pore on the surface of the skin, connected to a narrow dermal chamber called an ampullary bulb by a small canal with a diameter of about one millimetre. These sharks are most responsive to fluctuating electrical fields between 0.1 and 10 Hz, with peak sensitivity around 1 Hz.

Although the receptors primarily detect low-frequency alternating currents (AC), they are particularly attracted to steady direct current (DC) electric fields. However, for the shark to detect a continuous DC voltage, it must move relative to the voltage source. 

In the northeastern coast of the United States, it is discovered that blue shark are able to maintain a straight courses for hundreds of kilometres over many days. It appears that the only continuously available cue that could be used to accomplish this is the geomagnetic field.

==Reproduction==
===Maturity in Male and Female Blue Sharks===
Maturity is assessed by observing sexual products and the developmental stage of reproductive organs.
Five reproductive variables are examined for their relationship to body growth: presence or absence of semen in the ductus deferens ampullae, length and wet weight of the testicle, Size and rigidity of the claspers. To assess maturity, the clasper&#x27;s inner length and degree of calcification are recorded: 
Mature males have fully calcified claspers that extend beyond the inner margin of their pelvic fins. 
Immature males have claspers that are either shorter or longer than the inner border but not fully calcified.

===Mating Behaviour===
Male blue sharks primarily court non-pregnant mature females since mating marks on females are common, appearing as several tiny incisions arranged in a semicircle on their Dorsal fins. These marks are the result of non-feeding bites during courtship and mating. Female Blue sharks have evolved skin three times thicker than that of males to withstand the rigors of mating.
Female blue sharks are classified as immature, subadult, or mature based on the size and development of their ovary, oviducal gland, and uterus.
Mature females have enlarged uterine walls, a fully differentiated oviducal gland, visible and enlarged Ovarian follicles and a right ovary separated and developed from the epigonal organ.
Immature females have an undifferentiated oviducal gland and uterus, a small right ovary lodged within the epigonal organ, and no visible follicles.

===Reproductive Stategy and Lifecycle===
Blue sharks are viviparous, with a yolk-sac placenta, giving birth to 4 to 135 pups per litter after a gestation period of 9 to 12 months. After birth, young sharks are left in specific nursery areas outside adult regions to develop independently. These nurseries offer a safe environment for newborns during their early months. Females mature at five to six years of age, while males mature at four to five years. Research suggests that females may exhibit natal and reproductive philopatry, meaning they return to specific sites to give birth.
==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===
The blue shark is an oceanic and epipelagic shark found worldwide in deep temperate and tropical waters from the surface to about . In temperate seas it may approach shore, where it can be observed by divers; while in tropical waters, it inhabits greater depths. It lives as far north as Norway and as far south as Chile. Blue sharks are found off the coasts of every continent, except Antarctica. Its greatest Pacific concentrations occur between 20° and 50° North, but with strong seasonal fluctuations. In the tropics, it spreads evenly between 20° N and 20° S. It prefers water temperatures between , but can be seen in water ranging from . Records from the Atlantic show a regular clockwise migration within the prevailing currents.

===Migration===
Blue sharks are highly migratory species, travelling vast distances across temperate and tropical waters. Their migrations are influenced by seasonal changes, prey availability, and the need for optimal environmental conditions. These sharks move both horizontally and vertically. Their swimming behaviour varies depending on the time of day. During the day, blue sharks move at a mean rate of 1.2 kilometers per hour, with a mean swimming speed of 1.3 kilometers per hour. At night, their activity increases, with a mean movement rate of 1.8 kilometers per hour and a swimming speed of 2.8 kilometers per hour. These increases in speed often occur during brief dives, particularly at night when sharks exhibit more vertical movement, ranging from shallow waters to depths exceeding 100 meters.

Blue sharks are most active at night, particularly in the early evening, with their lowest activity occurring during the early morning hours. During the day, they tend to remain around a depth of 30 meters, while at night they venture slightly deeper, around 40 meters. Most of their time is spent within a depth range of 18 to 42 meters, although they sometimes dive deeper. Their behaviour is also influenced by water temperature, preferring a narrow range of 14 to 16°C, though they are found in waters between 8.5 and 17.5°C. Blue sharks often swim near the surface in cooler months, but this behaviour decreases during the coldest or warmest months, likely due to surface temperature changes.

===Feeding===
Squid are the most important prey for blue sharks, but their diet includes other invertebrates, such as cuttlefish, blanket octopuses, and pelagic octopuses, as well as lobster, shrimp, crab, a large number of bony fishes (such as long-snouted lancetfish, snake mackerel and oilfish), small sharks, mammalian carrion and occasional sea birds (such as great shearwaters). Whale and porpoise blubber and meat have been retrieved from the stomachs of captured specimens and they are known to take cod from trawl nets. Sharks have been observed and documented working together as a &quot;pack&quot; to herd prey into a concentrated group from which they can easily feed. Blue sharks may eat tuna, which have been observed taking advantage of the herding behaviour to opportunistically feed on escaping prey. The observed herding behaviour was undisturbed by different species of shark in the vicinity that normally would pursue the common prey. The blue shark can swim at fast speeds, allowing it to catch up with prey easily. Its triangular teeth allow it to easily catch hold of slippery prey.

===Predators===
Younger and smaller individuals may be eaten by larger sharks, such as the great white shark and the tiger shark. Orcas have been reported to hunt blue sharks. This shark may host several species of parasites. For example, the blue shark is a definitive host of the tetraphyllidean tapeworm, &quot;Pelichnibothrium speciosum&quot; (&quot;Prionacestus bipartitus&quot;). It becomes infected by eating intermediate hosts, probably opah (&quot;Lampris guttatus&quot;) and/or longnose lancetfish (&quot;Alepisaurus ferox&quot;).

California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), Northern elephant seals (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;) and Cape fur seals (&quot;Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus&quot;) have been observed to feed on blue sharks.

Despite having excellent binocular vision and the capacity to see ahead when pursuing prey, research indicates that blue sharks are not always adept at spotting predators approaching from behind. According to an experiment, a large predator&#x27;s best attack angle when pursuing a blue shark is probably from the caudal direction. This puts the predator in a position to strike the caudal fin of the shark and immobilize it. Blue sharks are not totally helpless against a tail-on approach, though, as they can adjust their escape performance based on the reaction distance.

Rather than reacting at a greater distance and trying to swim away at a high sustained speed, blue sharks likely concentrate their energy on outmaneuvering predators with sharp turns and brief bursts of acceleration.
==Relationship to humans==
Blue shark meat is edible, but not widely sought after; it is consumed fresh, dried, smoked and salted and diverted for fishmeal. There is a report of high concentration of heavy metals (mercury and lead) in the edible flesh. The skin is used for leather, the fins for shark-fin soup and the liver for oil. Blue sharks are occasionally sought as game fish for their beauty and speed.

Blue sharks rarely bite humans. From 1580 up until 2013, the blue shark was implicated in only 13 biting incidents, four of which ended fatally.

===In captivity===
Blue sharks, like most pelagic sharks, tend to fare poorly in captivity. The first attempt of keeping blue sharks in captivity was at Sea World San Diego in 1968, and since then a small number of other public aquaria in North America, Europe and Asia have attempted it. Most of these were in captivity for about three months or less, and some of them were released back to the wild afterwards. The record time for blue sharks in captivity is 246 and 224 days for two individuals at Tokyo Sea Life Park, 210 days for an individual at New Jersey Aquarium, and 194 days for one at Lisbon Oceanarium and 252 and 873 days for two individuals at Sendai Umino-Mori Aquarium.

The blue shark that survived the longest in captivity was captured in Shizugawa Bay on July 27, 2018, and taken to the Sendai Umino-Mori Aquarium. The total length at the time of delivery was , the estimated weight was , and the age was about 1 year old. After that, it lived for 873 days, but died due to factors such as disordered swimming due to dehydration. At the time of death, the total length was and the weight was . This growth rate is said to be the same as that of wild blue sharks.

Blue sharks are relatively easy to feed and store in captivity, and the three primary issues appear to be transport, predation by larger sharks and trouble avoiding smooth surfaces in tanks. Small blue sharks, up to long, are relatively easy to transport to aquaria, but it is much more complicated to transport larger individuals. However, this typical small size when introduced to aquaria means that they are highly vulnerable to predation by other sharks that are often kept, such as bull, grey reef, sandbar and sand tiger sharks. For example, several blue sharks kept at Sea World San Diego initially did fairly well, but were eaten when bull sharks were added to their exhibit. Attempts of keeping blue sharks in tanks of various sizes, shapes and depths have shown that they have trouble avoiding walls, aquarium windows and other smooth surfaces, eventually leading to abrasions to the fins or snout, which may result in serious infections. To keep blue sharks, it is therefore necessary with tanks that allow for relatively long, optimum swimming paths where potential contact with smooth surfaces is kept at a minimum. It has been suggested that prominent rockwork may be easier to avoid for blue sharks than smooth surfaces, as has been shown in captive tiger sharks.

==Conservation status==
Blue sharks make up approximately 85–90% of the total elasmobranchs caught by oceanic fisheries as bycatch.
In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the blue shark as &quot;Not Threatened&quot; with the qualifier &quot;Secure Overseas&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

<text>Gabriel Parra (1947–1988) was the drummer of Chilean folk group Los Jaivas. He was the youngest of the three Parra brothers who formed the band.

He died in a crash in Peru in 1988. After this accident, his daughter Juanita Parra replaced him as drummer in Los Jaivas.

== Notoriety ==
He is widely considered to be the top drummer from Chile, with a unique and strong style.
In 1979 Los Jaivas toured England for the first time. They played at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London, where they were seen by a writer from Music Week. He later wrote that Gabriel Parra was one of the ten top drummers in the world.

<doc id="240929" wikidata="Q5096264" url="?curid=240929" title="Chicken Ranch (Nevada)">
<text>The Chicken Ranch is a legal, licensed brothel located about west of Las Vegas near the town of Pahrump, in Nye County, at 10511 Homestead Road. The 17-bed brothel sits on of land. A separate building, connected to the main house by a breezeway, contains three extensively-decorated themed &quot;bungalows&quot; catering to those customers wishing a more luxurious experience.

Approximately 60 courtesans call the Chicken Ranch &quot;home&quot; with around 12 to 15 women living and working there at any time. The women often stay for at least 2 weeks at a time.

The ladies are independent contractors and set their own prices and menu of services. Due to Nye County ordinances, solicitation cannot be done outside of the house of the brothel.

The ranch used to house a collection of memorabilia from the original Chicken Ranch which was located outside of La Grange, Texas.

The ranch also houses the Leghorn Bar. The bar has a separate entrance for visitors not wishing to enter the brothel parlor.

The Chicken Ranch is adjacent to another legal brothel, Sheri&#x27;s Ranch.

==History==

Walter Plankinton opened the Nevada Chicken Ranch in 1976, as close to Las Vegas as legally possible. He encountered strong opposition from local law enforcement and other brothel owners. It remains the closest brothel to Las Vegas.

The initial location of the Chicken Ranch was inside the town limits of Pahrump, where prostitution was illegal. Plankinton was arrested and found guilty of violating the town&#x27;s laws. He moved the brothel to a new location within Nye County, but outside of town limits. After lengthy appeals he served 60 days in jail in 1981.

Nye County did not require brothels to be licensed in 1976, and three other brothels operated legally in the county at the time. Nevertheless, officials circulated a petition opposing the Chicken Ranch and then tried to close it down as a &quot;public nuisance &quot;&quot;&quot;. The resulting court case reached the Nevada Supreme Court, which ruled in Plankinton&#x27;s favor in 1978.

In 1978, the Chicken Ranch was burned to the ground, allegedly by arsonists. Plankinton reopened with a new set of trailers 5 days later.

In 1982, Plankinton sold the Chicken Ranch for $1,250,000 to Kenneth Green, a San Francisco businessman, and Russel Reade, an ex-teacher. Reade, who had contributed $25,000 towards the purchase, became the manager. Around 15 women were working at the ranch at that time.

Chicken Ranch Airport was an airstrip on premises which allowed small planes to land at the brothel. Pictures from 1994 show the airstrip was closed by this time.

On February 8, 2006, the ranch accepted a purchase offer for $5.2 million.

<doc id="240931" wikidata="Q42876406" url="?curid=240931" title=".hack (video game series)">
<text>.hack () is a series of single-player action role-playing video games developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Bandai for the PlayStation 2. The four games, &quot;.hack//Infection&quot;, &quot;.hack//Mutation&quot;, &quot;.hack//Outbreak&quot;, and &quot;.hack//Quarantine&quot;, all feature a &quot;game within a game&quot;, a fictional massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called &quot;The World&quot; which does not require the player to connect to the Internet. Players may transfer their characters and data between games in the series. Each game comes with an extra DVD containing an episode of &quot;.hack//Liminality&quot;, the accompanying original video animation (OVA) series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.

The games are part of a multimedia franchise called &quot;Project .hack&quot;, which explores the mysterious origins of &quot;The World&quot;. Set after the events of the anime series, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, the games focus on a player character named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become comatose in the real world as a result of playing &quot;The World&quot;. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of the game and its effects on the stability of the Internet.

Critics gave the series mixed reviews. It was praised for its unique setting and its commitment to preserve the suspension of disbelief, as well as the character designs. However, it was criticized for uneven pacing and a lack of improvement between games in the series. The commercial success of the franchise led to the production of &quot;.hack//frägment&quot;—a Japan-only remake of the series with online capabilities—and &quot;.hack//G.U.&quot;, another video game trilogy which was released for the PlayStation 2 between 2006 and 2007. A remastered collection of the latter was released for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in 2017, titled &quot;.hack//G.U. Last Recode&quot;. The collection was later released on the Nintendo Switch on March 11, 2022.

==Gameplay==
&quot;.hack&quot; simulates an MMORPG; players assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called &quot;The World&quot;. The player controls the on-screen player character Kite from a third-person perspective but first-person mode is available. The player manually controls the viewing perspective using the game controller. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons, and &quot;Root Towns&quot; that are free of combat. They can also log off from &quot;The World&quot; and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, message boards, and desktop and background music customization options. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within &quot;The World&quot; at a Save Shop. A Data Flag appears on the save file after the player completes the game, allowing the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series.

The series is typical of action role-playing games, in which players attack enemies in real time. The game&#x27;s action pauses whenever the menu is opened to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player directly controls Kite and the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide the computer-controlled characters with guidelines (&quot;attack&quot;, &quot;first aid&quot;, &quot;magic&quot;, etc.) or issue direct commands. Most hostile creatures are contained within magic portals and combat will not begin until the player character approaches the portal and releases the monsters inside. Kite possesses a unique ability called &quot;Data Drain&quot; which allows him to transform these enemies into rare items. Many boss monsters are known as &quot;Data Bugs&quot;—enemies with corrupted data which gives them infinite health. Data Drain is used to repair the damaged monsters&#x27; data and render them vulnerable but its use increases Kite&#x27;s level of infection, randomly causing harmful side effects. The infection can be cured by defeating enemies without Data Drain.

Root Towns are non-combat areas of &quot;The World&quot; where the player may restock items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other players of &quot;The World&quot;. In many towns, the player may also raise a sentient, pig-like creature called a Grunty, which can be ridden in fields and in later games raced for prizes. A blue portal called the Chaos Gate is used to travel between towns (called &quot;servers&quot;) and to access the fields and dungeons where battles occur. A three-word password system controls the characteristics of each area; attributes such as the prevalence of monsters or items change depending on the properties of each word in the password phrase. Certain plot-related areas have restricted access, but the player character has an ability called &quot;Gate Hacking&quot; which allows him to access these areas using &quot;Virus Cores&quot; obtained through Data Drain.

==Plot==

===Setting===
The &quot;.hack&quot; games are set in an alternate history Earth, in the year 2010. After a computer virus called &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Kiss&quot; crashes nearly every computer in the world, access to the Internet is closed to the general public to address security concerns. After two years without the Internet and online games, a MMORPG called &quot;The World&quot; is released. It becomes the most popular online game of all time with over 20 million unique players. Shortly before the events portrayed in the &quot;.hack&quot; games, a number of users become comatose as a result of playing &quot;The World&quot;. However, the developers blame their condition on cyberterrorism.

&quot;The World&quot; was developed by a German programmer named Harald Hoerwick; its backstory is based on the &quot;Epitaph of Twilight&quot;, an epic poem by Emma Wielant. Her death inspired Hoerwick to create the game. Elements of the poem are coded into the game&#x27;s programming. The hidden purpose of Hoerwick&#x27;s game is to develop the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable of making decisions for itself. To this end, Hoerwick inserted functions into the system which monitor and extract behavioral data from millions of the game&#x27;s players to aid in the AI&#x27;s learning process. After Hoerwick&#x27;s death, these pieces of code became black boxes to the current developers, who cannot fathom their purpose, yet are critical to the proper functioning of the game.

===Characters===
The main protagonist of &quot;.hack&quot; is Kite, a new player of &quot;The World&quot; whose friend Orca becomes comatose under mysterious circumstances. Kite is joined by nearly twenty other players in his quest to solve the mystery of the coma victims. The players who have the greatest impact on the success of Kite&#x27;s mission are BlackRose, a fellow newbie to &quot;The World&quot; whose brother is also in a coma; Balmung, a legendary player who seeks to eliminate sources of corruption in the game he loves; and Wiseman, an information broker who becomes a key strategist for Kite&#x27;s team. Helba, a professional hacker, and Lios, a reluctant system administrator, also aid in Kite&#x27;s efforts to rescue the coma victims. Two non-human characters play important roles in the story: Aura seeks to complete her growth into the ultimate AI, while Morganna, an AI who rebels against her task of nurturing Aura, acts as the unseen primary antagonist.

===Story===
In &quot;.hack//Infection&quot;, Kite&#x27;s friend Orca invites him to play &quot;The World&quot;. In the first dungeon they visit, they encounter a girl in white, Aura, being chased by a humanoid monster. Aura tries to entrust Orca with an item called &quot;the Book of Twilight&quot;, but the monster attacks him, crashing &quot;The World&quot;&#x27;s servers. Kite&#x27;s player discovers that Yasuhiko, Orca&#x27;s player, has fallen comatose after the attack, and resolves to discover the cause. Kite meets BlackRose, who takes him to a cathedral where they are attacked by a headless swordsman. The legendary player Balmung appears and defeats it, but the monster revives itself as a Data Bug. The Book of Twilight then activates, altering Kite&#x27;s character data and giving him the Twilight Bracelet. He uses its Data Drain to correct the swordsman&#x27;s code, allowing Balmung to kill it. Balmung accuses Kite of causing the viral infection spreading through the game, and leaves. Kite and BlackRose decide to cooperate to help the coma victims. After investigating a number of leads, Kite and BlackRose track down Skeith, the creature that put Orca into a coma. They defeat Skeith. The remnants of Skeith attracts a much larger enemy named Cubia, which defeats Kite and his party. Helba then drives Cubia away.

In &quot;.hack//Mutation&quot;, Kite and BlackRose encounter system administrator Lios, who declares Kite&#x27;s bracelet to be an illegal hack. He tries to delete Kite&#x27;s character data, but fails due to Kite&#x27;s data being encrypted by the Book of Twilight. Helba intervenes, and convinces Lios to observe Kite for the time being. Lios directs them to an area where they find Innis, a monster with powers similar to Skeith&#x27;s. Upon defeating Innis, Kite receives an e-mail from Aura, who reveals that she is an AI. They travel to an area to meet her; but Cubia attacks them, and they repel the monster with difficulty. Short on leads, they contact Wiseman, who is intrigued by Kite&#x27;s bracelet. He suggests that Skeith and Innis are based on the &quot;Cursed Wave&quot;, an antagonistic force featured in the poem &quot;Epitaph of Twilight&quot;, upon which &quot;The World&quot; is based. Wiseman helps grant them access to Net Slum, a place known as a paradise for hackers and wandering AIs. Upon arrival, another Cursed Wave monster called Magus attacks them. They defeat it and return to the Root Town, where they discover that the computer virus has spread to &quot;The World&quot; main servers and into the real world.

In &quot;.hack//Outbreak&quot;, Balmung realizes that he cannot end the situation on his own, and joins Kite&#x27;s quest. BlackRose tells Kite that her brother became comatose under similar circumstances as Orca, which renews both characters&#x27; determination. Wiseman formulates a plan to combat the Cursed Wave, enlisting Helba&#x27;s assistance. Their teamwork destroys the Wave monster Fidchell, but the aftermath causes networks in the real world to malfunction. Aura contacts Kite again, but their meeting is cut short by Cubia&#x27;s reappearance. Lios, observing Cubia&#x27;s power, agrees to join Kite, Helba, and the others to combat the Cursed Wave. In the resulting operation, the team pools their resources to defeat another Wave monster called Gorre, with no repercussions in the real world.

&quot;.hack//Quarantine&quot; sees the current server becoming increasingly unstable. To fix the problem, Helba replaces it with a copy of the Net Slum. At the bottom of a dungeon, Kite encounters Mia, a member of his party. He discovers that Mia is actually another Cursed Wave monster named Macha, whom he reluctantly defeats. Meanwhile, Cubia grows stronger, and Kite&#x27;s team barely fends off its latest attack. In contrast, Operation Orca is a success as they destroy Tarvos, the next Wave monster. Kite seeks the advice of Harald Hoerwick, the creator of the game who survives beyond death through his AI incarnations. Aura appears and hints that Cubia is the &quot;shadow&quot; of Kite&#x27;s Twilight Bracelet. Cubia ambushes them and destroys the AI Harald. In their final battle, Kite recalls Aura&#x27;s hint and has BlackRose destroy the bracelet, causing Cubia to fade away. Without the bracelet, the final Wave member, Corbenik, ambushes the party in Net Slum Root Town. With the aid of the spirits of the coma victims, Kite penetrates Corbenik&#x27;s barrier. Aura sacrifices herself to end the battle, restoring the network to normal and reviving all the coma victims.

==Development==

Development for &quot;.hack&quot; began in early 2000 with the aim of shocking and surprising the player and creating a distinctive product. CyberConnect2&#x27;s president Hiroshi Matsuyama played a key role in developing the concept for the series. A number of core ideas, including &quot;slaying dragons or being a thief in London&quot; were explored, but these were rejected in favor of an &quot;offline/online game&quot;. Matsuyama said that this would give young gamers an opportunity to experience online play without paying monthly fees or needing powerful Internet connections. The developers looked at a number of MMORPGs such as &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; for inspiration, and drew influences from the prior works of character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;) and scenario writer Kazunori Itō (&quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;). Itō noted that casting the player into the role of a subscriber of &quot;The World&quot; creates a unique story-telling situation which draws the player deeper into the plot.

From the start of its development, &quot;.hack&quot; was envisioned as a four-part series intended to mirror the four-volume story arcs found in manga. Matsuyama theorized that the act of transferring saved data across the four volumes would help to create a sense of the human drama embodied by the games&#x27; story and invest the player into the narrative. The games were developed simultaneously alongside other elements of &quot;Project .hack&quot; such as &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; to emphasize the multimedia aspect of the franchise. The three-month gap between each game&#x27;s release allowed the developers to make minor changes in response to criticisms. The games were packaged with bonus DVDs featuring episodes of &quot;.hack//Liminality&quot;, an original video animation (OVA) series that depicts events that occur concurrently with the games. The developers intended the OVA series to depict fictional events happening in the real world outside the game. Players in Japan who purchased all four games were rewarded with &quot;.hack//Gift&quot;, an OVA parodying the &quot;.hack&quot; series. After the completion of the series, the development team produced &quot;.hack//frägment&quot;, a game using the same engine as the &quot;.hack&quot; series with an online multiplayer component. The aims of &quot;.hack//frägment&quot; were to allow the developers to watch player interactions in an online environment and to gauge interest in an online &quot;.hack&quot; game.

==Reception==
By April 2004, the games had sold units in Japan and the United States. By March 2004, sales of the &quot;.hack&quot; games exceeded 1.73 million, with 780,000 copies sold in Japan.

Critics gave the series mixed reviews. &quot;.hack//Infection&quot; received the most positive reviews of the series; critics were intrigued by the games&#x27; unique premise. Jeremy Dunham of IGN was impressed by the game&#x27;s commitment to preserve the illusion of online and praised the character designs and the inclusion of the Japanese voice track, but criticized the camera manipulation and the game&#x27;s shortness and lack of difficulty. A &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewer praised the way it captures the sense of community that a real MMORPG offers.

Many reviewers cited the game&#x27;s unusual setting as the counterbalance to the mediocre gameplay, repetitive environments and poor camera control. Overall, the first game was moderately well received, with reviewers overlooking gameplay flaws because of a compelling story. Christian Nutt of GameSpy awarded if four stars out of five and commended Bandai for breaking new ground and Cyber Connect 2 for providing an engrossing RPG experience. Gary Steinman of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;[a]t its core, &quot;.hack&quot; is not a good game&quot;, calling the battle systems &quot;wildly unbalanced&quot; and the graphics &quot;spectacularly underwhelming&quot;, but said the &quot;mind-bending&quot; story allowed him to look past its obvious flaws and anticipate future games in the series. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot was less forgiving, deriding &quot;.hack//Infection&quot; as a sub-par version of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;.

&quot;.hack//Mutation&quot; also received mixed reviews, and many critics complained that little was done to address the problems of its predecessor. Fennec Fox of Gamepro said that game, &quot;is simply an extension of Infection&quot;, with &quot;muddy graphics, questionable control, and a story concept that&#x27;s just interesting enough to keep you going.&quot; Greg Kasavin of GameSpot gave it a rating of 6.7 out of 10 and wrote, &quot;not only does it bring you exactly the same sort of repetitive hack-and-slash gameplay, but it&#x27;s also similarly short and simple and once again offers little in the way of plot or character development.&quot; Nutt found the second game to be more addictive than the first, despite its numerous shortcomings such as obvious padding towards the end of the story. He praised the &quot;mixture of cool story and viscerally engaging RPG gameplay&quot;, the accelerating story, gameplay progression and memorable boss battles. Other reviewers were encouraged by the MMORPG-oriented details that contribute to the game&#x27;s presentation and built excitement for the future of the series. IGN also named &quot;.hack//Mutation&quot; as PlayStation 2 Game of the Month for May 2003.

&quot;.hack//Outbreak&quot; represented a shift in the critical reception of the series as reviewers grew tired of the incremental or nonexistent improvements between titles. Kasavin rated it 6.4 out of 10, and wrote that it &quot;just doesn&#x27;t make for a satisfying experience&quot;. Dunham gave it an overall rating of 8.4 out of 10, praised the battle system and wrote that there had been a great improvement in the artificial intelligence of ally characters and enemies, although he was disappointed by the lack of any other changes. Nutt awarded &quot;.hack//Outbreak&quot; three stars out of five, writing that the game&#x27;s &quot;extremely challenging enemies and lots of solo missions give the game an edge that keeps it from becoming boring&quot;. However, he criticized the four-part game structure, observing, &quot;we are paying Bandai $200 for one game&quot; and that &quot;the extreme lack of improvements from volume to volume is ... downright exploitative of the fans&quot;.

Some critics called the final game, &quot;.hack//Quarantine&quot;, a satisfying conclusion to a mediocre series, while others said it is a confusing mess of poor pacing and plot holes. Dunham awarded the game 8.3 out of 10 and called the plot twists &quot;shocking and clever&quot;. Kasavin rated it 6.1 out of 10 and wrote that, &quot;[o]n its own merits, Quarantine isn&#x27;t a bad game, and [loyal players] should find it to have a satisfying conclusion that, sure enough, leaves the possibility for further adventures in The World&quot;. He also called Bandai&#x27;s decision to add 60 to 80 hours of padding to the game, split it into four full-priced products, and release these as a series disappointing. Nutt was similarly disappointed with the final game, awarding it two stars out of five. He wrote that the story was well-presented and excellent, but that it was only present in the game&#x27;s first and last quarters. He was satisfied by the game&#x27;s ending and loved its story, style, and characters, but grew tired of the game&#x27;s &quot;endless chains of chambers, these easily-defeated enemies, this total lack of strategy&quot;. The &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewer hoped to see a more effective implementation of &quot;.hack&quot;″s concept in the future. Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu Weekly&quot; gave the &quot;.hack&quot; games scores in the 29 to 30 out of 40 range, indicating average reviews. However, the Japanese Computer Entertainment Supplier&#x27;s Association (CESA) honored the series for its combination of different fictional media including games, anime, radio, and manga into a compelling whole at the 2002–2003 CESA Awards.

==Related media and legacy==
The &quot;.hack&quot; video games are part of a multimedia franchise that includes novels, manga, and anime series. Set before the events of the video games, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; is an anime television series that establishes &quot;The World&quot; as a setting. &quot;.hack//Another Birth&quot; is a series of novels that retells the story of the games from BlackRose&#x27;s perspective. &quot;.hack//XXXX&quot; is a manga adaptation of the games&#x27; story with changes to some elements, such as Cubia acting as a player character. The first official sequel to the games is the manga and anime series &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot;, which began serializing on July 30, 2002. It tells the story of Shugo and Rena—regular players who win avatars of Kite and BlackRose in a contest—and their exploration of &quot;The World&quot; and its secrets. &quot;.hack//G.U.&quot; is a series of video games also released in multiple parts that forms the centerpiece of &quot;.hack Conglomerate&quot;, a new project set seven years after the events of &quot;Project .hack&quot; with a new version of &quot;The World&quot;.

===Music===

The games&#x27; soundtrack, titled &quot;.hack//Game Music Perfect Collection&quot;, was released as a double album in Japan on April 23, 2003. It features 68 compositions by Chikayo Fukuda, Seizo Nakata, and Norikatsu Fukuda. A special edition of this soundtrack includes a third disc featuring sound effects and clips used in the games. The album was released with fewer tracks in North America as &quot;.hack//Game Music Best Collection&quot;. Patrick Gann of RPGFan wrote that the second disc, which contains music for cutscenes and special events, was stronger than the first disc&#x27;s generic town and battle themes. He called the soundtrack &quot;techno meets opera&quot;, singled out the volume intro tracks for particular praise. Gann noted that the North American release functions as a &quot;Best of&quot; album, but felt that &quot;a lot of solid music [is] missing&quot; in this release. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic; Paul Koehler of RPGamer called the music &quot;particularly bland&quot; and IGN&#x27;s Dunham lamented that the second installment did not introduce many new pieces. However, he concluded that &quot;the melodious piano and oboe themes were still brawny enough to convince us that we needed to buy the soundtrack sometime in the near future&quot;.

===&quot;.hack//frägment&quot;===
&quot;.hack//frägment&quot; is a multiplayer online game based on the fictional MMORPG, &quot;The World&quot;. It was released only in Japan on November 23, 2005 and online service ended on January 18, 2007, after being extended two months because of its popularity. &quot;Famitsu Weekly&quot; gave &quot;.hack//frägment&quot; a cumulative score of 29 out of 40 over four reviews, much like its reviews of the main series. The game was never released outside of Japan because it was only intended for a Japanese audience. The game uses a modified version of the engine used in the &quot;.hack&quot; video game series and thus its gameplay differs from those games in a few ways. Players explore areas and fight monsters in real time but the game does not pause when the menu is opened. Due to this change it is now possible to assign items, messages and skills to hotkeys like in many other online games. Players may still use the skill &quot;Data Drain&quot; to weaken monsters and collect rare items. The user interface and control scheme are otherwise mostly unchanged.

Players may create their characters based on a number of preset body shapes and color schemes and may choose a class (such as Wavemaster or Twin Blade), character name and bonus stat points. In online mode, players may enter a lobby and search for a maximum of two other players to join them on an adventure. The game includes an expanded communication interface that allows players to chat, send e-mail, post to an in-game Bulletin Board System, and receive server news updates. It is possible to establish ad hoc chat rooms separate from the public-access ones. Guilds are permanent, exclusive chat rooms for members, and can also be used to set up a storefront to sell items to online players.

In offline mode, players may use the same character that they use for online mode, and any skills, items and levels they gain will carry over into online mode. Players may invite or create characters from the &quot;.hack&quot; games, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, and &quot;.hack//Legend of the Twilight&quot; into their party. The &quot;story mode&quot; of &quot;.hack//frägment&quot; is similar to that of the &quot;.hack&quot; games, though it does not feature any of the antagonists from the original games, and the scenario is an entirely non-canon what-if story.

Players may also install a companion program on their PC called &quot;Area Server&quot;, which allows them to create fields and dungeons for players to visit online. As players clear fields and dungeons on a user&#x27;s Area Server, the Area Server gains experience points and levels. Once the server reaches a certain level, it is possible for custom areas to become &quot;corrupted&quot;, much like in the events of the &quot;.hack&quot; games. Players can visit a corrupted area by breaking into it with virus cores obtained from using the Data Drain skill on enemies, and can defeat a data bug boss enemy at the bottom of the corrupted dungeon. Once the boss monster has been defeated, the area corruption is cleared.

Since the game&#x27;s official online service was closed in 2007, a private server has been created by fans of the game, along with a fan translation into English.

<text>John Leslie Mackie (25 August 1917 – 12 December 1981) was an Australian philosopher. He made significant contributions to ethics, the philosophy of religion, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language. Mackie had influential views on metaethics, including his defence of moral scepticism and his sophisticated defence of atheism. He wrote six books. His most widely known, &quot;&quot; (1977), opens by boldly stating, &quot;There are no objective values.&quot; It goes on to argue that because of this, ethics must be invented rather than discovered.

His posthumously published &quot;The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God&quot; (1982) has been called &quot;a&quot; &quot;tour de force&quot; in contemporary analytic philosophy. The atheist philosopher Kai Nielsen described it as &quot;one of the most, probably the most, distinguished articulation of an atheistic point of view given in the twentieth century.&quot; In 1980, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described him as &quot;perhaps the ablest of today&#x27;s atheistic philosophers&quot;.

==Life==
Mackie was born 25 August 1917 in Killara, Sydney, son of Alexander Mackie, professor of education at the University of Sydney and principal of the Sydney Teachers College, influential in the educational system of New South Wales. and Annie Burnett (née Duncan), who was a schoolteacher. Mackie graduated from the University of Sydney in 1938 after studying under John Anderson, sharing the medal in philosophy with Harold Glass. Mackie received the Wentworth Travelling Fellowship to study greats at Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated with first-class honours in 1940.

During the Second World War Mackie served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in the Middle East and Italy, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was professor of philosophy at the University of Otago in New Zealand from 1955 to 1959 and succeeded Anderson as the Challis Professor of philosophy at the University of Sydney from 1959 to 1963. In 1963, he moved to the United Kingdom, becoming the inaugural holder of the chair of philosophy in the University of York, a position he held until 1967, when he was elected a fellow of University College, Oxford, where he served as praelector. In 1969, he gave a lecture, &quot;What&#x27;s Really Wrong with Phenomenalism?&quot;, at the British Academy as part of its annual Philosophical Lectures series. In 1974, he became a fellow of the British Academy.

Mackie died in Oxford on 12 December 1981.

===Character and family===
Mackie is said to have been capable of expressing total disagreement in such a genial way that the person being addressed might mistake his comment for a compliment. This personal style is exemplified by the following words from the preface to &quot;Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong&quot;:

Mackie married Joan Meredith in 1947. One of their three children, Penelope Mackie, also became a philosopher. She lectured in philosophy at the University of Birmingham from 1994 to 2004, and then at the University of Nottingham from 2004 until her death in 2022. Mackie&#x27;s son David is also a philosopher and graduated from Oxford University, where he held lectureships at Exeter College, Corpus Christi College, and Christ Church before being appointed a Fellow and Tutor at Oriel College. He is Head of Philosophy at D&#x27;Overbroeck&#x27;s College, Oxford. His daughter Hilary is a classicist at Rice University.

==Philosophical work==
Mackie is best known for his contributions to metaethics, philosophy of religion, and metaphysics. 

In his work &quot;The Cement of the Universe: A Study of Causation&quot;, Mackie makes an analysis of causality by prior philosophers and sets forth his theory of causality based on counterfactual conditionals. He argued that a cause is an &quot;INUS condition&quot; (insufficient but non-redundant parts of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect). E.g, the statement &quot;The short circuit caused the fire&quot;, the short circuit is a necessary part of the fire condition (short circuit and flammable material) but not sufficient (a short circuit does not always result in a fire). This condition in turn is sufficient for a fire to take place, although not necessary (it can be replaced by other conditions such as &quot;lightning and flammable material&quot; or &quot;arson&quot;).

In metaethics, he took a position called moral scepticism, arguing against the objective existence of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; as intrinsically normative entities on fundamental grounds. He was unsure what kinds of thing they would be if they existed.

His most widely known work, &quot;Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong&quot;, bluntly begins with the sentence &quot;There are no objective values&quot;. He uses several arguments to support this claim. He argues that some aspects of moral thought are relative, and that objective morals require an absurd intrinsic action-guiding feature. Most of all, he thinks it is very unclear how objective values could supervene on features of the natural world (see the &quot;Argument from queerness&quot;), and argues it would be difficult to justify our knowledge of &quot;value entities&quot; or account for any links or consequences they would have. Finally, he thinks it possible to show that even without any objective values, people would still have reason to firmly believe in them (hence he claims that it is possible for people to be mistaken or fooled into believing that objective values exist). &quot;The Times&quot; called the book &quot;a lucid discussion of moral theory which, although aimed at the general reader, has attracted a good deal of professional attention.&quot;
Concerning religion, he was well known for vigorously defending atheism, and also arguing that the problem of evil made untenable the main monotheistic religions. His criticisms of the free will theodicy are particularly significant. He argued that the idea of human free will is no defence for those who wish to believe in an omnipotent being in the face of evil and suffering, as such a being could have given us both free will and moral perfection, thus resulting in us choosing the good in every situation. In 1955 he published &quot;Evil and Omnipotence&quot;, which summarized his view that belief in the existence of evil and an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-good god is &quot;positively irrational&quot;.

Mackie&#x27;s views on this logical problem of evil prompted Alvin Plantinga to respond with the &quot;free-will defense&quot;, which Mackie later responded in his &quot;The Miracle of Theism&quot;. In metaphysics, Mackie made significant contributions relating to the nature of causal relationships, especially conditional statements describing them and the notion of an INUS condition.

After being given a copy of Richard Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; as a Christmas present, in 1978 Mackie wrote an article in the journal &quot;Philosophy&quot; praising the book and discussing how its ideas might be applied to moral philosophy. The philosopher Mary Midgley responded in 1979 with &quot;Gene-Juggling&quot;, an article arguing that &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; was about psychological egoism rather than evolution. This started a dispute between Mackie, Midgley, and Dawkins that was ongoing at the time of Mackie&#x27;s death.

<doc id="240935" wikidata="Q838130" url="?curid=240935" title="SN1 reaction">
<text>The unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) reaction is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. The Hughes-Ingold symbol of the mechanism expresses two properties—&quot;SN&quot; stands for &quot;nucleophilic substitution&quot;, and the &quot;1&quot; says that the rate-determining step is unimolecular. Thus, the rate equation is often shown as having first-order dependence on the substrate and zero-order dependence on the nucleophile. This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the intermediate. Instead, the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady-state kinetics. The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. With primary and secondary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. In inorganic chemistry, the SN1 reaction is often known as the &quot;dissociative substitution&quot;. This dissociation pathway is well-described by the cis effect. A reaction mechanism was first introduced by Christopher Ingold et al. in 1940. This reaction does not depend much on the strength of the nucleophile, unlike the SN2 mechanism. This type of mechanism involves two steps. The first step is the ionization of alkyl halide in the presence of aqueous acetone or ethyl alcohol. This step provides a carbocation as an intermediate.

In the first step of SN1 mechanism, a carbocation is formed which is planar and hence attack of nucleophile (second step) may occur from either side to give a racemic product, but actually complete racemization does not take place. This is because the nucleophilic species attacks the carbocation even before the departing halides ion has moved sufficiently away from the carbocation. The negatively charged halide ion shields the carbocation from being attacked on the front side, and backside attack, which leads to inversion of configuration, is preferred. Thus the actual product no doubt consists of a mixture of enantiomers but the enantiomers with inverted configuration would predominate and complete racemization does not occur.

==Mechanism==
An example of a reaction taking place with an SN1 reaction mechanism is the hydrolysis of tert-butyl bromide forming &quot;tert&quot;-butanol:

This SN1 reaction takes place in three steps:

* Formation of a &quot;tert&quot;-butyl carbocation by separation of a leaving group (a bromide anion) from the carbon atom: this step is slow.
:
* Nucleophilic attack: the carbocation reacts with the nucleophile. If the nucleophile is a neutral molecule (i.e. a solvent) a third step is required to complete the reaction. When the solvent is water, the intermediate is an oxonium ion. This reaction step is fast.
* Deprotonation: Removal of a proton on the protonated nucleophile by water acting as a base forming the alcohol and a hydronium ion. This reaction step is fast.
== Rate law ==
Although the rate law of the SN1 reaction is often regarded as being first order in alkyl halide and zero order in nucleophile, this is a simplification that holds true only under certain conditions. While it, too, is an approximation, the rate law derived from the steady state approximation (SSA) provides more insight into the kinetic behavior of the SN1 reaction. Consider the following reaction scheme for the mechanism shown above:
Though a relatively stable tertiary carbocation, &quot;tert&quot;-butyl cation is a high-energy species that is present only at very low concentration and cannot be directly observed under normal conditions. Thus, the SSA can be applied to this species:
(1) Steady state assumption: 
formula_1

(2) Concentration of t-butyl cation, based on steady state assumption:
formula_2

(3) Overall reaction rate, assuming rapid final step:
formula_3

(4) Steady state rate law, by plugging (2) into (3):
formula_4

Under normal synthetic conditions, the entering nucleophile is more nucleophilic than the leaving group and is present in excess. Moreover, kinetic experiments are often conducted under initial rate conditions (5 to 10% conversion) and without the addition of bromide, so formula_5 is negligible. For these reasons, formula_6 often holds. Under these conditions, the SSA rate law reduces to:

formula_7

the simple first-order rate law described in introductory textbooks. Under these conditions, the concentration of the nucleophile does not affect the rate of the reaction, and changing the nucleophile (e.g. from H2O to MeOH) does not affect the reaction rate, though the product is, of course, different. In this regime, the first step (ionization of the alkyl bromide) is slow, rate-determining, and irreversible, while the second step (nucleophilic addition) is fast and kinetically invisible.

However, under certain conditions, non-first-order reaction kinetics can be observed. In particular, when a large concentration of bromide is present while the concentration of water is limited, the reverse of the first step becomes important kinetically. As the SSA rate law indicates, under these conditions there is a fractional (between zeroth and first order) dependence on [H2O], while there is a negative fractional order dependence on [Br–]. Thus, SN1 reactions are often observed to slow down when an exogenous source of the leaving group (in this case, bromide) is added to the reaction mixture. This is known as the &quot;common ion effect&quot; and the observation of this effect is evidence for an SN1 mechanism (although the absence of a common ion effect does not rule it out).

== Scope ==
The SN1 mechanism tends to dominate when the central carbon atom is surrounded by bulky groups because such groups sterically hinder the SN2 reaction. Additionally, bulky substituents on the central carbon increase the rate of carbocation formation because of the relief of steric strain that occurs. The resultant carbocation is also stabilized by both inductive stabilization and hyperconjugation from attached alkyl groups. The Hammond–Leffler postulate suggests that this, too, will increase the rate of carbocation formation. The SN1 mechanism therefore dominates in reactions at tertiary alkyl centers.

An example of a reaction proceeding in a SN1 fashion is the synthesis of &quot;2,5-dichloro-2,5-dimethylhexane&quot; from the corresponding diol with concentrated hydrochloric acid:
As the alpha and beta substitutions increase with respect to leaving groups, the reaction is diverted from SN2 to SN1.

==Stereochemistry==
The carbocation intermediate formed in the reaction&#x27;s rate determining step (RDS) is an &quot;sp2&quot; hybridized carbon with trigonal planar molecular geometry. This allows two different ways for the nucleophilic attack, one on either side of the planar molecule. If neither approach is favored, then these two ways occur equally, yielding a racemic mixture of enantiomers if the reaction takes place at a stereocenter. This is illustrated below in the SN1 reaction of S-3-chloro-3-methylhexane with an iodide ion, which yields a racemic mixture of 3-iodo-3-methylhexane:

However, an excess of one stereoisomer can be observed, as the leaving group can remain in proximity to the carbocation intermediate for a short time and block nucleophilic attack. This stands in contrast to the SN2 mechanism, which is a stereospecific mechanism where stereochemistry is always inverted as the nucleophile comes in from the rear side of the leaving group.

==Side reactions==

Two common side reactions are elimination reactions and carbocation rearrangement. If the reaction is performed under warm or hot conditions (which favor an increase in entropy), E1 elimination is likely to predominate, leading to formation of an alkene. At lower temperatures, SN1 and E1 reactions are competitive reactions and it becomes difficult to favor one over the other. Even if the reaction is performed cold, some alkene may be formed. If an attempt is made to perform an SN1 reaction using a strongly basic nucleophile such as hydroxide or methoxide ion, the alkene will again be formed, this time via an E2 elimination. This will be especially true if the reaction is heated. Finally, if the carbocation intermediate can rearrange to a more stable carbocation, it will give a product derived from the more stable carbocation rather than the simple substitution product.

==Solvent effects==

Since the SN1 reaction involves formation of an unstable carbocation intermediate in the rate-determining step (RDS), anything that can facilitate this process will speed up the reaction. The normal solvents of choice are both &quot;polar&quot; (to stabilize ionic intermediates in general) and &quot;protic solvents&quot; (to solvate the leaving group in particular). Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles, and the process is known as solvolysis.

The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through

:formula_8

with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for &quot;tert&quot;-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

<text>The King of Queens is an American television sitcom that ran on CBS from September 21, 1998, to May 14, 2007, with a total of 207 half-hour episodes spanning nine seasons. The series was created by Michael J. Weithorn and David Litt, who also served as the show&#x27;s executive producer, and stars Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug and Carrie Heffernan, a working-class couple living in Rego Park, Queens. All the episodes were filmed in front of a live studio audience.

&quot;The King of Queens&quot; was produced by Hanley Productions and CBS Productions (1998–2007), CBS Paramount Network Television (2007), in association with Columbia TriStar Television (1998–2002), and Sony Pictures Television (2002–07). It was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. The ninth and final season concluded with a double-length series finale in 2007. James and Remini reunited in the 2016 television sitcom &quot;Kevin Can Wait&quot;, which ended on May 7, 2018.

== Plot ==
Doug (Kevin James) and Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini) are a middle-class couple living at &quot;3121 Aberdeen St.&quot; in Rego Park, Queens, New York, along with Carrie&#x27;s widower father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller). Doug works for the fictional International Parcel Service (IPS) as a delivery driver, while Carrie works as a legal secretary in Manhattan. Their lives are plagued by the demands of Arthur; so much so that they eventually hire Holly, a professional dog walker, to spend time with him as she walks dogs in the park. Doug&#x27;s constant deceit and schemes through various situations leave him humiliated as his plans backfire.

Also featured on the show are Doug&#x27;s friends Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt), and Richie Iannucci (Larry Romano), as well as Doug&#x27;s cousin Danny Heffernan (played by James&#x27; real-life brother Gary Valentine). Deacon&#x27;s wife Kelly (Merrin Dungey) is Carrie&#x27;s best friend, having met through the relationship her husband has with Deacon Palmer.

Most scenes take place in the Heffernans&#x27; home, but other common locations include Doug and Carrie&#x27;s workplaces, the restaurant/pub &quot;Coopers&quot;, and the residences of friends and family. While locations seen during the opening montage were filmed in areas around New York including the Empire State building, the Statue of Liberty and Sbarro Pizza, the series was filmed in California.

The series begins after Doug and Carrie have been married for 3 years, and how they met is somewhat unclear due to continuity issues. In one flashback episode, &quot;Meet By-Product&quot;, Doug meets Carrie while he is a bouncer at a nightclub that Carrie attends. However, in another episode, &quot;Road Rayge&quot;, Carrie reflects on a song that she says Doug asked her to dance to when they were in junior high school.

== Characters ==
=== Main ===

* Doug Heffernan (played by Kevin James) is an average parcel delivery man working for International Parcel Service (IPS). Born on February 9, 1965, in Montreal, Canada (his Canadian origin was unbeknownst to him until the season 5 episode &quot;Dog Shelter&quot;), he has a cheeky personality and never hesitates to protest his grievances vocally. Some of his problems are fueled by his love of food. These basic desires sometimes cause him to think of selfish, dangerous schemes in order to get what he wants, although they usually fall through in the end, causing constant arguments between Doug and Carrie. Doug&#x27;s tendency to give in to his temptations, despite promising Carrie otherwise, is another common cause of conflict. He generally enjoys the simple pleasures of watching sports and playing poker with his friends.
* Carrie Heffernan, née &quot;Simone Spooner&quot; (played by Leah Remini), is Doug&#x27;s sardonic wife. She has a fiery temper and occasionally lashes out at people, mainly Doug. She has been characterized as scary by Holly and Doug, particularly when she is annoyed. During a flashback, Carrie concludes that she is happier when others are miserable. She never finished college and is employed as a legal secretary. Her constant attempts to make her relationship with Doug more romantic and loving cause Doug anxiety, as he prefers a simple life with as few restrictions as possible. The more impulsive and broad-minded of the couple, Carrie often pushes Doug to make more of himself and improve his outlook, but she is generally just as mean-spirited as he is. Although Carrie mocks Doug for his careless behavior, she has proven to be careless as well at times, with little patience for others&#x27; problems or tolerance for their quirks. Carrie&#x27;s best friend is Deacon&#x27;s wife, Kelly Palmer.
* Arthur Spooner (played by Jerry Stiller) is Carrie&#x27;s widowed father, who has been married three times. His fourth marriage is to Spence&#x27;s mother (played by Anne Meara, Stiller&#x27;s real-life wife) during the final episode of the final season, which ends shortly after in the same episode. Arthur is the classic oddball of the family. He lives in the basement of the Heffernan house because he accidentally set fire to his own uninsured home, burning it to the ground in the pilot episode. Very volatile, Arthur is mostly known for his incoherent, irascible outbursts and on rare occasion, offering up lucid thoughts and perspectives. He tells a lot of questionable stories of what he claims he has been through in his past, although his claim of having been a television and film actor for a time in years past turns out to be true. Arthur regularly causes chaos in the Heffernan household and gets on Doug&#x27;s and Carrie&#x27;s nerves. And, although he and Doug have a bitter rivalry in some episodes, he still approves of Doug, regardless. Doug and Carrie sometimes have trouble finding time alone because Arthur tends to get in the way. Arthur also tries to cause trouble with Doug&#x27;s friends. He especially bullies Spence but also (unsuccessfully) tries it on Deacon, who often refers to him as &quot;the old man&quot;.
* (played by Victor Williams) is Doug&#x27;s best friend and co-worker. Towering in height, and athletic, Deacon is a year and a few weeks younger than Doug, but the more level-headed of the two, in addition to being the classic &quot;family man&quot;. He and his wife Kelly have two sons, Major and Kirby. He is often seen hanging out with Doug, whether it is on their lunch breaks at work, over the weekends, or for family gatherings. He will often help Doug plan elaborate schemes to fool Carrie, but he rarely likes to get involved himself. Deacon attended St. John&#x27;s University in Queens, where he received two bachelor&#x27;s degrees, one in art history and one in music. In the first-season episode &quot;Best Man&quot;, Deacon mentions having served in the National Guard. He also volunteers as a big brother. In season 3, he gets caught having an affair with another woman and separates from Kelly in season 4, reconciling later in the series.
* Spencer &quot;Spence&quot; Olchin (played by Patton Oswalt) (main seasons 1–2, 4–9; recurring, season 3) is another friend of Doug&#x27;s and the nerd of the group. He tends to be angst-ridden, sickly, and takes an interest in science fiction, fantasy movies, and comic book conventions—interests that his friends do not share. Spence&#x27;s birthday is February 14. He is of Albanian heritage, and works as a subway token booth clerk. He moved to New York City from rural West Virginia. In one episode he is a &quot;house boy&quot; for Deacon and Kelly. His character is based largely on the actor who plays him. Spence demonstrates intelligence and competence in a variety of pursuits, but he is haunted by his family history, his intimidating and troubled mother, and his inability to protect himself. Numerous episodes mention that Spence is asthmatic (a burden he shares with Danny) and allergic to peanuts (however, in the episode &quot;Richie&#x27;s Song&quot; he is seen eating Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s out of Doug&#x27;s vehicle). In the season eight episode &quot;Hartford Wailer&quot;, Spence is said to be from Ottawa but it appears that he had only said that to Huey Lewis in an attempt to impress him. He has a pet Pug named Allen. In the series&#x27; penultimate episode &quot;Single Spaced&quot;, Spence shows romantic interest in Carrie when it appears she and Doug will divorce.
* Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Iannucci (played by Larry Romano) (main seasons 1–2; guest season 3, 9) is one of Doug&#x27;s closest friends. He and Doug were roommates before Doug married Carrie (shown in the episode &quot;Meet By-Product&quot;). He was quietly written out of the show in season three so Romano could work on another sitcom (&quot;Kristin&quot;). During that season, he only appeared in one episode, &quot;Paint Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;. He mostly addressed Doug as &quot;Moose&quot;. Richie was known as the ladies&#x27; man among Doug&#x27;s friends, even admitting to sleeping with Doug&#x27;s sister. Richie is an FDNY firefighter. He is also something of a con artist. His last appearance on the show was in the episode &quot;Paint Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;, in which he has sex (off-screen) with Doug&#x27;s sister Stephanie (Ricki Lake); although she promises to call him afterward, she has no intention to. He was also briefly seen in a few clips during the flashback montage at the end of the series finale.
* Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Heffernan (played by Gary Valentine) (recurring seasons 1–3, main cast seasons 4–9) is Doug&#x27;s cousin, and he is also seen hanging out with Doug, Deacon and Spence. In the show&#x27;s early seasons, Doug has a negative view of Danny bordering on hate due to the latter&#x27;s over-eagerness to spend time with the former, but at the end of &quot;S&#x27;no Job&quot;, they become friends and co-workers, and regularly hang out along with Deacon and Spence. Danny soon becomes Spence&#x27;s roommate in a small apartment. The two fight like a married couple, and many of the jokes revolve around what looks to their friends like a romantic relationship. At one point, they legally marry in order to get a free TV from a sales pitch for which only married couples are eligible. Danny once owned a pizza parlor, and he is divorced from a woman named Eva. He once had the nickname &quot;Stumpy&quot;, given to him by Doug. Episodes &quot;Silent Mite&quot; and &quot;Paint Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; reveal that Danny has asthma and uses an inhaler. Gary Valentine and Kevin James are real-life brothers. They each created last names for their acting careers. Valentine is their father&#x27;s middle name.
* Holly Shumpert (played by Nicole Sullivan) (guest season 3; main cast seasons 5–7, recurring season 4, 8–9) is a polite yet timid dog-walker who, like the Heffernans, lives in Queens, where she was hired by Doug and Carrie to &quot;walk&quot; Arthur. She is often seen arriving at the Heffernan home to pick up Arthur but is also a family friend of the Heffernans. She is often viewed as strange because of her habits, the men she dates, her &quot;sketchy&quot; ethics, and her habit of drinking too much, to which she openly confesses. Holly is a gentle soul, especially as she puts up with Arthur&#x27;s antics, and is kind to Carrie despite the fact that Carrie often mistreats her. Holly was written out of the series at the beginning of season eight, but she later returned, pregnant, for one last appearance in the series finale (&quot;China Syndrome&quot;). Sullivan also appeared in a different role in the season 3 episode &quot;Pregnant Pause&quot;.
* Sara Spooner (played by Lisa Rieffel) (season 1 episodes 1–3, 5–6; mentioned season 3) is Carrie&#x27;s younger half-sister, an irresponsible aspiring actress. She appears in only five of the first six episodes, and was only mentioned one other time (although not by name) in episode 52 (&quot;Roast Chicken&quot;) by Doug as an excuse to his boss to get out of performing a roast. After the show became more popular, Kevin James was asked during an interview to explain what happened to Sara. According to James, the producers could not think of any storylines to develop Rieffel&#x27;s character, so she was discontinued. During the pilot, she was on camera for roughly half the episode. However, in the other episodes in which she was included, her character did not have much to say or do. Subsequent plot lines and dialogue suggest that Sara Spooner never existed, and that Carrie is an only child.

=== Recurring ===
* Kelly Palmer (played by Merrin Dungey), Deacon&#x27;s wife, and Carrie&#x27;s friend. Dungey was absent from the show in 2002 because she needed to take a break from the series and during this period, she and Deacon are separated and engaged in divorce proceedings, and she is involved in a brief affair, before they reconcile. 
* Lou Ferrigno (himself) (seasons 3–9) is the actor best known for his role as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. He and his wife are the Heffernans&#x27; next-door neighbors. A running gag on the series is that the neighbors (including the Heffernans) are fascinated by him, and it gets on his nerves. Lou does not like people telling him Hulk jokes, for instance, and other characters often make reference to that previous role. In one example, Doug is angry, and Lou attempts to calm him down; Doug retorts with the well-known line from the opening of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t make me angry; you wouldn&#x27;t like me when I&#x27;m angry.&quot; Also, in the episode &quot;Gym Neighbors&quot;, it is revealed that Lou&#x27;s character suffers from a video-game addiction. Ferrigno&#x27;s wife Carla makes a number of appearances as herself throughout the series&#x27; run.
* Supervisor Patrick O&#x27;Boyle (played by Sam McMurray) (seasons 3–9) is section supervisor for the fictional International Parcel Service. He is Doug&#x27;s boss throughout most of the show, whom he mostly refers to as &quot;Heffernan&quot;. A recovering alcoholic and gambling addict, he appears in many of the IPS scenes throughout the series&#x27; run. O&#x27;Boyle is portrayed as mildly aggressive and annoyed at Doug. A character named Supervisor Jack O&#x27;Boyle (played by John F. O&#x27;Donohue) appears in an episode from season one (&quot;White Collar&quot;, 1999). In season 8, on the episode &quot;Consummate Professional&quot;, Doug flashes back to when he first started working at IPS, and the McMurray O&#x27;Boyle character is portrayed, not the O&#x27;Donohue O&#x27;Boyle character.
* Joe Heffernan and Janet Heffernan are Doug&#x27;s parents (played by Dakin Matthews and Jenny O&#x27;Hara) (seasons 3-9). They live in a retirement community in Florida, but occasionally come to visit or Doug goes to see them. They both tend to treat Doug like a child, a role he readily slips into, as comes to light in the Season 4 episode &quot;Screwed Driver&quot; when Janet and Joe come to visit while Carrie is out of town and Doug reverts to adolescent behavior, or when they revealed that they kept getting a new dog to avoid having to tell Doug his childhood dog had died many years earlier. Joe and Janet have a brief marital issue when Janet feels neglected by Joe and she starts spending more time with Arthur. 
* Victor Raider-Wexler as Mr Kaplan and Mr Kaufman (seasons 2-9), the wealthy and demanding head of Carrie&#x27;s law firm. For unknown reasons or continuity error, he appears in two different roles first in seasons 2-6 as Mr Kaplan in the law firm Kaplan, Hornstein &amp; Steckleron and then in season 7-9 as Mr Kaufman when Carrie switches to a new firm. 
* Doug Pruzan (played by Alex Skuby) (seasons 2–6) is Carrie&#x27;s somewhat neurotic boss, a lawyer at a Manhattan law firm. 
* Veronica Olchin (season 1; played by Grace Zabriskie, seasons 5–9; played by Anne Meara), Spence&#x27;s mother. She is portrayed by Zabriskie in her first appearance in &quot;S&#x27;aint Valentines&quot;, but portrayed by Meara for the balance of the series. Veronica has an on-again/off-again relationship with Arthur, who is portrayed by Meara&#x27;s real-life husband Jerry Stiller. Meara had previously appeared in &quot;S&#x27;aint Valentines&quot; as a woman who flirts with Arthur. Arthur and Veronica marry in the series finale, but divorce a year later.
* Stephanie Heffernan, Doug&#x27;s sister (played by Ricki Lake) (seasons 3-4, six episodes). A high school gym teacher who feels her parents favor Doug, she briefly dates Doug&#x27;s friend Richie. She isn&#x27;t seen and is rarely mentioned after season 4. 
* Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Barone (played by Ray Romano) (seasons 1, 2 &amp; 8; four episodes) is Doug&#x27;s Long Island friend. Romano and James appearing on each other&#x27;s shows was part of a network program crossover, as CBS aired both &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; and &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. Romano&#x27;s appearance was successful enough to warrant all other lead characters (Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett, Doris Roberts, and Peter Boyle) to appear as their respective characters as well. Appropriately, the four episodes featuring Romano contained &quot;Ray&quot; in their titles (&quot;Road Rayge&quot;, &quot;Rayny Day&quot;, &quot;Dire Strayts&quot;, and &quot;Raygin&#x27; Bulls&quot;).

== Series background ==
Centered on the lives of blue-collar couple Doug and Carrie Heffernan, &quot;The King of Queens&quot; debuted on CBS on September 21, 1998. During its run, it brought in solid ratings (usually ranking in the Top 40, and peaking at #19 in its fourth season) for the most part and was a Monday night staple, competing with shows such as the long-running drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. In 2003, when moved to Wednesday and scheduled against &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Nanny 911&quot;, it began to drop in the ratings. The final episode aired on May 14, 2007. The series was shot at Sony Pictures Studios&#x27; Stage 28 in Culver City, California. The character of Arthur was conceived with Jerry Stiller in mind, but he initially turned down the role. Veteran comedian Jack Carter was then cast and a pilot was shot. Soon afterward, Stiller changed his mind and took the part, which required re-shooting of scenes featuring Carter.

&quot;The King of Queens&quot; was partly inspired by the classic television sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, the characters of Doug and Carrie being loosely based on the Kramden couple, with some similar mannerisms and deadpan expressions. In the 2001 episode &quot;Inner Tube&quot;, the show pays homage to &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; as a distraught Doug dreams that he is Ralph Kramden, Carrie is Alice Kramden, and Deacon is Ed Norton. The sequence was filmed in black and white, and the audio quality (including audience reactions) matches a 1950s style.

== Theme song and opening sequences ==
The season one main opening was a simple eight-second sequence which showed the window of a subway train moving past and then quickly stopping at the original show logo, which then peeled off to reveal the names of the show&#x27;s creators. Starting with the entire 2nd season, the show added a new theme song called &quot;Baby All My Life I Will Be Driving Home to You&quot;, which was written by series writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, composed by Jonathan Wolff and Scott Clausen, and performed by Billy Vera and the Beaters. An instrumental version was used as the closing theme during season 2, but was replaced in season 3 with a new closing theme composed by Kurt Farquhar.

With the show&#x27;s transition to widescreen, the opening credits introduced in season 2 featured an opening shot of Doug climbing aboard an IPS truck, which then cuts to a long shot of his truck driving past the 111th Street elevated subway station, where the show&#x27;s logo is digitally placed on the exterior. It then cuts to scenes of Doug, Carrie, and Arthur spending time around Queens, including local landmarks such as the Unisphere and Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. In the season 2 sequence, James&#x27; starring credit was placed over a shot of the Brooklyn Bridge with the Manhattan skyline, but was edited after the September 11 attacks that felled the World Trade Center.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
The show&#x27;s first season scored a 33% &quot;rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Strong chemistry among its charming leads can&#x27;t help &quot;The King of Queens&quot; rise above its toothless humor and dated sitcom set-ups.&quot; However, Clint Morris of &quot;FilmThreat&quot; lauded the series, praising James as &quot;one of the funniest guys to grace the TV tube since Bill Cosby.&quot; By the ninth and final season, the show received largely positive critical reviews with an 85% &quot;fresh&quot; score on Rotten Tomatoes. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The King of Queens&quot; would never reign as a critical darling, but the series bowed out with dignity as an unassuming and undemanding sitcom worth having a beer with.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the series has a score of 55 out of 100 based on the reviews of 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Series stars James, Remini, Williams, Oswalt, Valentine, Sullivan, and guest star Rachel Dratch all reprised their roles in the table read with Weithorn, reciting the 2003 episode &quot;Cowardly Lyin&#x27;&quot;. The reunion was moderated by Sibley Scoles and also featured a video tribute to Stiller. In January 2024, James stated to &quot;The Kelly Clarkson Show&quot;, that there will be no plans for a reboot due to the death of Stiller.

He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 21 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections) and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career. The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in NBA history, with 22, and holds the record for the most minutes played in NBA history.

James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities. A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league&#x27;s premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010. James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in a nationally televised special titled &quot;The Decision&quot; and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.

James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league&#x27;s MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team&#x27;s first championship, ending the Cleveland sports curse, and winning his third Finals MVP. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP. On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers.

Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and starred in the sports film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.

==Early life==
James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth. His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.

James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade. He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. The group dubbed themselves the &quot;Fab Four&quot; and promised each other that they would attend high school together. In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.

==High school==
===Basketball===
As a tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team. The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated. As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game. For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron&#x27;s 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions. For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.

In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in &quot;Slam&quot; magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to , as &quot;[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now&quot;. During the season, James also appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so. With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA First Team, and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year. St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game. Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA&#x27;s draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft. During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.

Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play several nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2. Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James&#x27;s popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary&#x27;s games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable. For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game, was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year, and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.

Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James&#x27;s future earning power as an NBA player. This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points. St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.

===Football===
As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary&#x27;s football team. He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame. At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game. Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)===
====2003–2004: Rookie of the Year====

James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance. At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie. Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.

====2004–2008: Rise to superstardom====
In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference. Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He&#x27;s the exception to almost every rule.&quot; On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland&#x27;s new single-game points record. With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team. Despite a 30–20 record to start the year, the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.

At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player. Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash. Under James&#x27; leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998. In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards. In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5. Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.

In the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland&#x27;s last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons. After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance &quot;one of the greatest moments in postseason history&quot; and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as &quot;[Michael] Jordan-esque&quot;. In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history. The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals. The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs&#x27; zone defense. He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.

In February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance. On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers&#x27; all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty. James&#x27; 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title. Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland&#x27;s record fell from the year before to 45–37. Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round. During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a &quot;shootout&quot;.

====2008–2010: MVP seasons====

At the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history. With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award. Reflecting on James&#x27; performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: &quot;He&#x27;s having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it&#x27;s time we gave him his due for it.&quot;

In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.

In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers&#x27; backcourt. Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season. Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland&#x27;s home crowd. The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.

===Miami Heat (2010–2014)===
====&quot;The Decision&quot;====

James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled &quot;The Decision&quot; that he would sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.

Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. &quot;The Decision&quot; itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James&#x27; choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James&#x27; actions. Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. Former NBA players, including Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s. Some commentators did defend James&#x27; decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers&#x27; inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls. James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from &quot;The Decision&quot;. As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America&#x27;s most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years. The phrase &quot;taking my talents to South Beach&quot; became a punch line for critics. In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of &quot;The Decision&quot;.

====2010–2011: Year of media and fan scrutiny====

James officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012. As part of the first player-created NBA superteam he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982. That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new &quot;Big Three&quot; at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere. During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships. Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.

Throughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains. To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games. James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past. On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent. He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball. The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East&#x27;s second seed, with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.

In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year. In Game 5, he scored Miami&#x27;s last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win. After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team. The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points. His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.

====2011–2013: Back-to-back championships====
The 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game. Humbled by the Heat&#x27;s loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court. Behind his expanded skillset, Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record. James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.

In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1. James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series. To compensate for Bosh&#x27;s absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh&#x27;s return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics. Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called a &quot;career-defining performance&quot;. Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James&#x27; budding rival Kevin Durant. Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps. In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James&#x27; first championship. James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.

In February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records. That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history. Based on these accomplishments, James&#x27; performance was described as a &quot;month for the ages&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record, and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously. His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.

In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers. Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his &quot;Cleveland days&quot;. Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs, signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier. At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3. In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory. In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points. James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.

====2013–2014: Final season in Miami====
On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting. In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets. In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead. In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate. San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami&#x27;s quest for a three-peat. For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.

===Return to Cleveland (2014–2018)===
On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent. On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that he intended to return to the Cavaliers. In contrast to &quot;The Decision&quot;, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received. The next day, James officially signed with the team, who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure. A month after James&#x27; signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.

====2014–2016: Ending Cleveland&#x27;s championship drought====

In January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career. In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals. For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities. Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games. Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.

During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers&#x27; coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East. James&#x27; final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.

To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala&#x27;s go-ahead layup attempt, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city&#x27;s first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.

====2016–2018: End of second stint in Cleveland====
The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers; James later described it as one of the &quot;strangest&quot; years of his career. Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland&#x27;s front office for constructing a team that he felt was too &quot;top heavy&quot;, for which he received countercriticism. The Cavaliers finished the season as the East&#x27;s second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game. In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Jordan as the league&#x27;s all-time postseason scoring leader. The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James&#x27; rival Kevin Durant during the off-season. Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.
Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James. After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December. Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record. In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort. The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry. Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits. James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.

In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors. Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, &quot;LeBronto&quot; was popularized. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime. Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series. The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2018–present)===
====2018–2019: Injury and playoff miss====
On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent. Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers; the deal was officially completed on July 9. In an interview with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, James&#x27;s agent Rich Paul explained: &quot;In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.&quot; Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.

The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010. Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games. In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James&#x27;s strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers. Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat. After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury, the first major injury of his career. James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him, marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005. In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction, and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season. James&#x27; final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game. Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.

====2019–2020: Fourth NBA championship====

During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis. James immediately embraced the team&#x27;s much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort. Behind James&#x27; leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history. On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list. The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers. In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game. He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.

The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way. In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter. In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead. In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami&#x27;s Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game. The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series, his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award. At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award, and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises. James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.

====2020–2021: Back-to-back chase====
The 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 31, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 victory over the San Antonio Spurs. On February 18, 2021, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; aged 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone. On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Atlanta Hawks, but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game. By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Utah Jazz, but they went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5. James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.
In May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Toronto Raptors, but he returned for the final two games, and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games; this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history. In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament. The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with two steals and a block. His shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.

In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Phoenix Suns. This marked the first time in James&#x27; career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series. They were up 2–1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists. The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career. James finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals. He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history, being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.

====2021–2022: First in the 10K-10K-10K club====
For the 2021–22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook. In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121–116 victory. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game, and James was suspended for one game due to his actions. In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double, while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points; during this period, James played 35 percent of his minutes at center. From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.
In December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Jordan) to post 40 points and no turnovers at age 35 or older. In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team&#x27;s games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as James averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old. He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old. By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists. In the same period, he surpassed Robertson for fourth all-time free throws made, and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals. In February, James surpassed Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs; by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists. At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 74 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar; his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star victory, defeating Team Durant 163–161, with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.

In March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers&#x27; career-high, becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James&#x27; 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason. He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists. On March 27, James became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points. Due to an ankle injury in late March, he missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title, having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify; aged 37, James would have broken Jordan&#x27;s record of oldest scoring leader at 34.
For &quot;The Athletic&quot;, Bill Oram wrote that James&#x27; ankle injury felt like &quot;the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season&quot;. On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James&#x27;s first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Phoenix Suns. It marked the fourth time in James&#x27; career that he missed the playoffs. James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle. He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges. On May 24, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.

==== 2022–2023: All-time scoring record ====
On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.

On February 7, 2023, James passed Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in NBA history. Abdul-Jabbar had previously set the record on April 5, 1984, eight months before James was born. After James broke the record, the NBA stopped the game with 10.9 seconds left in the third quarter for an on-court ceremony. During the ceremony, he received the game ball from Abdul-Jabbar. James also gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family. James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness. On February 19, Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184–175 to Team Giannis, marking the first time that James lost an All-Star game as a captain. Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5–0) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018. During the game, James suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.

On February 26, James sustained a right foot injury during a game against the Dallas Mavericks. Despite the injury, he was able to finish the game and helped the Lakers pull off the biggest comeback victory of the season at the time after trailing by 27 points late in the first half. He scored 26 points on 10-for-23 shooting, eight rebounds, and three assists in 37 minutes. However, following an examination by team medical staff on March 2, James was diagnosed with a tendon injury in his right foot and would be reevaluated in three weeks. After missing the next 13 games, James made his return on March 26 against the Chicago Bulls. He came off the bench for just the second time in his career; the other being in 2007.

In the Western Conference finals, the Lakers were swept by the eventual NBA champion Denver Nuggets; James set his personal playoff record with 31 points in the first half.

====2023–2024: NBA Cup MVP and 40K points====

====2024–2025: First father-son duo====
On July 6, 2024, James re-signed with the Lakers. Two weeks prior, James&#x27;s son Bronny had been drafted 55th overall by the Lakers. This marked the first father-son duo in NBA history.

==National team career==

As a 19-year-old rookie, James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. He spent the Games mostly on the bench, averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points, and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games. Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup. James felt that his limited playing time was a &quot;lowlight&quot; and believed he was not given &quot;a fair opportunity to play&quot;.

At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal. James&#x27;s behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.

Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice. At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. James credited the team&#x27;s attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.&quot; At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000. In the final game, James&#x27; statistics were – 14 points, six rebounds, and three assists against Spain.

James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England. He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists. Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. James contributed 19 points in the victory, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men&#x27;s basketball history. He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: &quot;[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.&quot;

After a 12-year gap, James rejoined the national team on the 2024 Olympic squad in Paris as Team Captain at 39 years old. Voted by the entire 592-strong U.S. delegation, James was named as one of the two Team USA flag-bearers for the opening ceremony of the games, becoming the first male basketball player to be so honored. James led the team in rebounds and assists. He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles. Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98–87 in the final game, with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists. At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men&#x27;s Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men&#x27;s Olympics All-Star Five. James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics.

==Player profile==
Standing tall and weighing , James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions, but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary. His playing style, which is athletic and versatile, has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. Through the 2023–24 season, James&#x27; career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game. Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

===Offense===

As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring. He holds numerous &quot;youngest to&quot; distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented, he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball. His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones. These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets. Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game. Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.

In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James&#x27; role to a more unconventional one. James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots. He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat&#x27;s &quot;pass-happy&quot; offense. Behind these improvements, James&#x27; overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels. During this time, ESPN&#x27;s Tom Haberstroh called James&#x27;s free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as &quot;average&quot;. Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016. His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA&#x27;s worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint. Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.

For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team. His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history. By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses, he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists. James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters. Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games; however, as his career progressed, James&#x27; clutch performance was viewed more favorably.

===Defense===

At the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player, but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot. In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions. From the years 2012–2016, he was ranked among the top three defenders in the NBA by general managers, earning the vote as the best perimeter defender in the league preceding the 2014–15 NBA season. Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines. During his second stint in Cleveland, James&#x27; defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching. James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as &quot;chill mode&quot;. He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as &quot;Playoff LeBron&quot;.

==Legacy==
James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history. Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season. As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records. His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span. James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time, and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.

On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history, and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s. This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Jordan in debates over the sport&#x27;s all-time best. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest. In February 2018, &quot;The Ringer&quot; spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead. In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan. The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan. Davis &quot;et al.&quot; of &quot;Business Insider&quot; stated: &quot;The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he&#x27;s still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.&quot; Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan&#x27;s status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that &quot;the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim&quot; and that &quot;in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse&quot;, Jordan having more titles and an &quot;unblemished Finals record holds significant weight&quot;.

In addition to praising James&#x27; on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; opined that James&#x27; move to the Heat in 2010 &quot;defined a decade of player movement&quot;, and that he &quot;fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.&quot; James&#x27; fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: &quot;We&#x27;ve taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he&#x27;s opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.&quot; Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James&#x27; free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in &quot;superteams&quot; in the 21st century.

In 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce. This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history. On October 22, 2024, in the season opener against the Minnesota Timberwolves, they shared the court for the first time.

==Personal life==
James married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California. They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri. Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald&#x27;s All-American in 2023, 20 years after James&#x27;s selection. During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay. In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million. He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million. In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million. James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.

James&#x27;s best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the &quot;banana boat crew&quot;. During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: &quot;He saved my life&quot;. When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t really know what to say, to be honest. I&#x27;m just happy he&#x27;s still here, obviously.&quot; James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.

In September 2023, &quot;ESPN&quot; reported that a new set of client names from the Biogenesis scandal had been released; included was Ernest &quot;Randy&quot; Mims, a longtime friend and business manager of James, as well as David Alexander, a well-known trainer of prominent athletes who co-owned a cold-pressed juice and smoothie business with Savannah and also served as her personal trainer. The DEA determined that there &quot;was never any indication that LeBron James did anything wrong.&quot;

===Health===
James invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James&#x27;s fitness as being on &quot;another level&quot;. However, James&#x27; routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, falsely believing it to be good for his heart, while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.

In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James&#x27;s jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland, which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers&#x27; run in the 2009 playoffs.

===Public image===
James is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the &quot;face of the NBA&quot;, often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry. His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season. On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).

Throughout his career, James has been ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one of the world&#x27;s most influential athletes, and has been listed by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters. Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees. Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and &quot;The Decision&quot;, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States. By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career. In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll. He has led the league in jersey sales six times.


Memorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James&#x27; rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020. A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month. All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James&#x27; jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.

In March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen. In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and &quot;memorable for the wrong reasons&quot;, describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.

==Activism==
===Philanthropy===
James has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based. Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes. In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021. In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his &quot;outstanding service and dedication to the community.&quot;

In November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school. The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment. Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron, I Promise Village (housing complex), House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza), and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).

James is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, and Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.

===Politics===
Throughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status. Those include the War in Darfur, the killing of Trayvon Martin, the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling&#x27;s racist comments in 2014, the Michael Brown verdict, the death of Eric Garner, the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests, the shooting of Breonna Taylor, the death of Ma&#x27;Khia Bryant, Kyle Rittenhouse, and the ruling of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; that overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 2022.

On August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake. In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players&#x27; committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year&#x27;s NBA season.

During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey, in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was &quot;misinformed&quot;. His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement, with many taking to social media to use racist language against him. In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government&#x27;s human rights abuses. James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.

In October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram. His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.

====Presidential elections====
In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama&#x27;s 30-minute &quot;American Stories, American Solutions&quot; television advertisement. The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert. In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that &quot;being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.&quot; Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; slogan and said: &quot;It&#x27;s sad what&#x27;s going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!&quot; James also called President Donald Trump a &quot;bum&quot; after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry. During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that &quot;sports has never been something that divides people it&#x27;s always been something that brings someone together.&quot; He declared that he would &quot;never sit across from him. I&#x27;d sit across from Obama though.&quot; In response, Trump tweeted: &quot;LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn&#x27;t easy to do.&quot;

On August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote, saying, &quot;People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that&#x27;ve been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.&quot;

On October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election in a video posted on social media.

==Media figure and business interests==

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire, making him one of the richest celebrities.

James&#x27; biography &quot;LeBron&quot; was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict. The biography is based on three years of research and more than 250 interviews.

===Endorsements===
James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are AT&amp;T, Audemars Piguet, Beats by Dre, Blaze Pizza, Coca-Cola, Dunkin&#x27; Brands, Intel, Kia, McDonald&#x27;s, Nike,PepsiCo, State Farm, and Taco Bell. Coming out of high school, James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas, eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in May 2003 for approximately $90 million. His signature shoes have performed well for Nike. In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool, who he has claimed his support for. As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million. In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple&#x27;s acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones. In 2015, James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson, and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi). James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity. In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.

During Super Bowl LVI in 2022, James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement, where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self, offering advice about the future. The commercial, produced by James&#x27; SpringHill Company and directed by Calmatic, did not directly promote the service, sparked social media buzz, and inspired a series of memes centered on the advice he could have offered.

Subsequently, Crypto.com launched an NFT airdrop campaign, distributing 5,550 tokens featuring the NBA champion. Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad. Also, in 2022, James&#x27; charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.

===Entertainment===
James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards. In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot;. In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film &quot;Trainwreck&quot;, receiving positive reviews for his performance. That same year, James&#x27; digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company&#x27;s efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.

James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment, whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary &quot;More Than a Game&quot;, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James&#x27; high school years. Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show &quot;The Wall&quot;, the Disney XD sports documentary show &quot;Becoming&quot;, the Starz sitcom &quot;Survivor&#x27;s Remorse&quot;, and the animated web series &quot;The LeBrons&quot;. In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called &quot;Cleveland Hustles&quot;, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland. In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled &quot;The Carter Effect&quot; was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince. In February 2018, it was announced that James&#x27; production company will produce a new film in the &quot;House Party&quot; series with James expected to make a cameo. Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to &quot;shut up and dribble&quot; as a response to his political agendas. This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, &quot;Shut Up and Dribble&quot; on Showtime. James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.

In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz&#x27;s new album &quot;Rap or Go to the League&quot;. A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is &quot;celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.&quot; The press release also says the title &quot;challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.&quot; As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.

In June 2022, it was announced James was launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means &quot;flower&quot; and &quot;bear&quot; in Japanese.

In March 2024, James and JJ Redick launched a podcast called &quot;Mind the Game&quot;, where the two have &quot;pure conversations about basketball.&quot;

===Investments===
In 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017. James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald&#x27;s.

During the 2019 offseason, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term &quot;Taco Tuesday&quot; for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services. This was related to James&#x27;s use of the term on Instagram for his family&#x27;s taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was &quot;a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.&quot;

In November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707. After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA&#x27;s Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021. That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually. The investment made James and Carter the company&#x27;s first black partners.

James has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.

In August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.

James is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).

===Professional contracts===
James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012. James, Paul, Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James&#x27;s marketing, including the marketing of &quot;The Decision&quot;, for which it was criticized.

Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility; in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season. This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat. During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks, which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind. During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction, James began re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA&#x27;s rising salary cap. In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal, becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.

<doc id="240942" wikidata="Q316857" url="?curid=240942" title="Jerry Stiller">
<text>Gerald Isaac Stiller (June 8, 1927 – May 11, 2020) was an American comedian and actor. He spent many years as part of the comedy duo Stiller and Meara with his wife, Anne Meara, to whom he was married for over 60 years until her death in 2015. Stiller saw a late-career resurgence starting in 1993, playing Frank Costanza on the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, a part which earned him an Emmy nomination. In 1998, Stiller began his role as Arthur Spooner on the CBS comedy series &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, another role that garnered widespread acclaim.

Stiller appeared together with his son Ben Stiller in films such as &quot;Zoolander&quot;, &quot;Heavyweights&quot;, &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;, &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;, and &quot;Zoolander 2&quot;. He also performed voice-over work for films and television, including &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In his later career, Stiller became known for portraying grumpy and eccentric characters who were nevertheless beloved.

== Early life ==
The eldest of four children, Stiller was born on June 8, 1927, at Unity Hospital in New York City, to Bella (née Citron; 1902–1954) and William Stiller (1896–1999), a taxi and bus driver. His family is Jewish. His paternal grandparents emigrated from Galicia (southeast Poland and western Ukraine), and his mother was born in Frampol, Russian Empire. He lived in the Williamsburg and East New York neighborhoods of Brooklyn before his family moved to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where he attended Seward Park High School and played Adolf Hitler in a school production.

Upon his return from service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Stiller attended Syracuse University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Speech and Drama in 1950. He also studied drama at HB Studio in Greenwich Village. In the 1953 Phoenix Theater production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (produced by John Houseman), Stiller, along with Gene Saks and Jack Klugman, formed (as told by Houseman in the 1980 memoir &quot;Front and Center&quot;) &quot;the best trio of Shakespearian clowns that I have ever seen on any stage&quot;.

Also in 1953, Stiller met actress-comedian Anne Meara, and they married in 1954. Until Stiller suggested it, Meara had never thought of doing comedy. &quot;Jerry started us being a comedy team,&quot; she said. &quot;He always thought I would be a great comedy partner.&quot; They joined the St. Louis improv company The Compass Players in 1959, directed by David Shepherd. After leaving, they began performing together. In 1961, they were performing in nightclubs in New York City and by the following year were considered a &quot;national phenomenon&quot;, said the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

== Stiller and Meara ==

The comedy team Stiller and Meara, composed of Stiller and his wife, Anne Meara, was successful throughout the 1960s, with numerous appearances on television variety programs, primarily on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In 1970, they broke up the live act before it broke up their marriage. They subsequently forged a career in radio commercials, notably the campaign for Blue Nun wine. They also starred in their own syndicated five-minute sketch comedy show on radio, &quot;Take Five with Stiller and Meara&quot;, from 1977 to 1978.

From 1979 to 1982, Stiller and Meara hosted &quot;HBO Sneak Previews&quot;, a half-hour show produced monthly on which they described the movies and programs to be featured in the coming month. They also did some comedy sketches between show discussions. The duo had their own 1986 TV sitcom, &quot;The Stiller and Meara Show&quot;, in which Stiller played the deputy mayor of New York City and Meara portrayed his wife, a TV commercial actress.

== Career resurgence ==

=== &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ===
Late in his career, Stiller earned the part of the short-tempered Frank Costanza, father of George Costanza, on the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. He played the role from 1993 until 1998. Stiller&#x27;s character as initially envisioned was a &quot;meek&quot; and &quot;Thurberesque&quot; character that required him to wear a bald cap. After a couple of days of rehearsal, Stiller realized the character was not working and asked &quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-creator Larry David if he could perform the character in a different way, which was more in line with his final characterization on the show. For his portrayal of Frank, Stiller gained widespread critical and popular acclaim, including being nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 1997 and winning an American Comedy Award for Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series in 1998.

=== &quot;The King of Queens&quot; ===

After &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ended, Stiller had planned on retiring. However, Kevin James asked him to join the cast of &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. James, who played the leading role of Doug Heffernan, had told Stiller that he needed him to have a successful show. Stiller agreed and played the role of Arthur Spooner, the father of Carrie Heffernan, from 1998 until 2007. Stiller said that this role tested his acting ability more than any other had, and that, before being a part of &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, he only saw himself as a &quot;decent actor&quot;.

=== Other appearances ===
Stiller played himself in filmed skits opening and closing Canadian rock band Rush&#x27;s 30th Anniversary Tour concerts in 2004. These appearances are seen on the band&#x27;s DVD &quot;R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour&quot;, released in 2005. Stiller later appeared in cameos for in-concert films for the band&#x27;s 2007–08 Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour. Stiller appeared on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;$20,000 Pyramid&quot; show in the 1970s, and footage of the appearance was edited into an episode of &quot;The King of Queens&quot; to assist the storyline about his character being a contestant on the show, and, after losing, being bitter about the experience, as he never received his parting gift, a lifetime supply of Rice-a-Roni. He also made several appearances on the game show &quot;Tattletales&quot; with his wife, Anne Meara.

In the late 1990s, Stiller appeared in a series of Nike television commercials as the ghost of deceased Green Bay Packers head coach Vince Lombardi. He also appeared in various motion pictures, most notably &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001) and &quot;Secret of the Andes&quot; (1999). On February 9, 2007, Stiller and Meara were honored with a joint star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On October 28, 2010, the couple appeared on an episode of &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. Stiller voiced the announcer on the children&#x27;s educational show &quot;Crashbox&quot;. Starting in October 2010, Stiller and Meara began starring in &quot;Stiller &amp; Meara&quot;, a Yahoo web series from Red Hour Digital in which they discussed current topics. Each episode was about two minutes long. Stiller also worked as a spokesman for Xfinity.

== Author ==

Stiller wrote the foreword to the 2005 book &quot;Festivus: The Holiday for the Rest of Us&quot; () by Allen Salkin. The book discussed Festivus, the fictional holiday promulgated by Stiller&#x27;s &quot;Seinfeld&quot; character Frank Costanza.

Stiller also authored a memoir titled &quot;Married to Laughter: A Love Story Featuring Anne Meara&quot;, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster ().

== Personal life ==
Stiller was married to Anne Meara for over 60 years, from 1954 until her death on May 23, 2015. The two met in an agent&#x27;s office. Meara was upset about an interaction with the casting agent, so Stiller took her out for coffee — all he could afford — and they remained together thereafter. Meara was Irish Catholic and converted to Judaism before the couple&#x27;s two children were born. They had two children: actress Amy Stiller (b. 1961) and actor-comedian Ben Stiller (b. 1965). He had two grandchildren through Ben.

==Death ==
On May 11, 2020, Stiller died from natural causes at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan at the age of 92. Many actors Stiller worked with, including &quot;Seinfeld&quot; castmates Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, and Michael Richards and &quot;King of Queens&quot; castmates Kevin James and Leah Remini, paid tributes to him. He is buried in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

<doc id="240945" wikidata="Q257217" url="?curid=240945" title="Anne Meara">
<text>Anne Meara (September 20, 1929 – May 23, 2015) was an American comedian and actress. Along with her husband Jerry Stiller, she was one-half of the prominent 1960s comedy team Stiller and Meara. Their son is actor, director, and producer Ben Stiller. She was also featured on stage, on television, and in numerous films and later became a playwright. During her career, Meara was nominated for four Emmy Awards and a Tony Award, and she won a Writers Guild Award as a co-writer for the television movie &quot;The Other Woman&quot;.

==Early years==
Meara was born on September 20, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Mary (née Dempsey) and Edward Joseph Meara, a corporate lawyer for American Standard. Both of her parents were of Irish descent. An only child, she was raised in Rockville Centre, New York, on Long Island. When Anne was 11 years old, her mother committed suicide.

When she was 18, Meara spent a year studying acting at the Dramatic Workshop at The New School and at HB Studio under Uta Hagen in Manhattan. The following year, in 1948, she began her career as an actress in summer stock.

==Career==
===Comedy team===

Meara met actor-comedian Jerry Stiller in 1953, and they married soon after. Until he suggested it, she had never thought of doing comedy. &quot;Jerry started us being a comedy team,&quot; she said. &quot;He always thought I would be a great comedy partner.&quot; They joined the Chicago improvisational company The Compass Players (which later became The Second City) and, after leaving, formed the comedy team of Stiller and Meara. She debuted off-Broadway in 1958 in &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;, based on the work by James Joyce. In 1961, she and Stiller were performing in nightclubs in New York and by the following year were considered a &quot;national phenomenon&quot;, said the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

Their often improvised comedy routines brought many relationship foibles to live audiences. Their skits focused on domestic themes, as did Nichols and May, another comedy team from the Chicago Compass Players project during that period. &quot;They were Nichols and May without the acid and with warmth,&quot; notes author Lawrence Epstein. They also added a new twist to their comedy act, he adds, by sometimes playing up the fact that Stiller was Jewish and Meara was Catholic. After Nichols and May broke up as a team in 1961, Stiller and Meara were the number-one couple comedy team by the late 1960s. And as Mike Nichols and Elaine May were not married, Stiller and Meara became the most famous married couple comedy team since Burns and Allen.

After some years honing the act, Stiller and Meara became regulars on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, with 36 appearances, and other TV programs, including &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. They released their first LP in 1963, &quot;Presenting America&#x27;s New Comedy Sensation: Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara Live at The Hungry I&quot;, which became a hit. By 1970, however, they broke up their act because it was affecting their marriage: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know where the act ended and our marriage began,&quot; complained Meara in 1977. Stiller agreed, fearing, &quot;I would have lost her as a wife.&quot;

===Television, stage, film, and video===
During the 1970s, Meara and Stiller wrote and performed many radio commercials for Blue Nun Wine. In 1975, she starred in her own series, &quot;Kate McShane&quot;, on CBS. She was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1976; however, the show was canceled after ten episodes. She had a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Rhoda&quot; as airline stewardess Sally Gallagher, one of the title character&#x27;s best friends. She had roles as Mrs. Curry in &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978) and as Mrs. Sherwood in &quot;Fame&quot; (1980).

In the 1970s, she provided narration for segments of the educational television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; consisting of scenes from silent films.

Meara co-starred with Carroll O&#x27;Connor (with whom she had appeared onstage off-Broadway many years earlier in &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;) and Martin Balsam in the early 1980s hit sitcom &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, which was a continuation of the influential 1970s sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot;. She played Veronica Rooney, the bar&#x27;s cook, for the show&#x27;s first three seasons (1979–1982). During that time, she acted in the movie &quot;Fame&quot; (1980), in which she played English teacher Elizabeth Sherwood. She appeared as Dorothy Halligan Deaver, the grandmother, in the TV series &quot;ALF&quot; in the late 1980s. &quot;The Stiller and Meara Show&quot;, her own 1986 TV sitcom, in which Stiller played the deputy mayor of New York City and Meara portrayed his wife, a television commercial actress, was unsuccessful. From 1999 to 2007, Meara guest starred in &quot;The King of Queens&quot; (where her husband played Arthur Spooner), first as Mary Finnegan, then as Veronica Olchin (mother of Spence, who was played by Patton Oswalt). Veronica and Arthur were married in the series finale.

Starting in October 2010, Meara and Jerry Stiller began starring in a Yahoo! web series called &quot;Stiller &amp; Meara&quot; produced by Red Hour Digital, a production company owned by their son Ben Stiller.

In 2011, she accepted a role in the off-Broadway play &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot; with Conchata Ferrell, AnnaLynne McCord, Minka Kelly, and B. Smith.

===Writing and consulting===
In 1995, Meara wrote the comedy &quot;After-Play&quot;, which became an off-Broadway production. In her later years, she portrayed recurring roles on the television shows &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (as Mary Brady) and &quot;The King of Queens&quot; (as Veronica Olchin). During the 2004–05 season, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

In 2009, Meara wrote her personal life reflections in a New York-focused online blog titled &quot;Mr. Beller&#x27;s Neighborhood -- New York City Stories&quot;. In it, Meara recalled her mother&#x27;s death and her childhood experiences at Catholic boarding school.

== Personal life ==
===Religion===
Meara was born, baptized, and raised a Roman Catholic. She converted to Judaism six years after marrying Stiller. She insisted that she did not convert at Stiller&#x27;s request, explaining, &quot;Catholicism was dead to me.&quot; She took her conversion seriously and studied the Jewish faith in such depth that her Jewish-born husband quipped, &quot;Being married to Anne has made me more Jewish.&quot; They discussed how they met and their early career during a guest appearance on the TV game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1968.

===Children===
Meara and her husband had two children, Amy and Ben.

===Death===
Meara died on May 23, 2015, aged 85, in Manhattan. She had been living in the Hebrew Home for the Aged following several strokes and reportedly died of natural causes.

<doc id="240949" wikidata="Q392622" url="?curid=240949" title="Markovnikov's rule">
<text>In organic chemistry, Markovnikov&#x27;s rule or Markownikoff&#x27;s rule describes the outcome of some addition reactions. The rule was formulated by Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov in 1870.

==Explanation==
The rule states that with the addition of a protic acid HX or other polar reagent to an asymmetric alkene, the acid hydrogen (H) or electropositive part gets attached to the carbon with more hydrogen substituents, and the halide (X) group or electronegative part gets attached to the carbon with more alkyl substituents. This is in contrast to Markovnikov&#x27;s original definition, in which the rule states that the X component is added to the carbon with the fewest hydrogen atoms while the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen atoms.

The same is true when an alkene reacts with water in an additional reaction to form an alcohol that involves carbocation formation. The hydroxyl group (OH) bonds to the carbon that has the greater number of carbon-carbon bonds, while the hydrogen bonds to the carbon on the other end of the double bond, that has more carbon–hydrogen bonds.

The chemical basis for Markovnikov&#x27;s Rule is the formation of the most stable carbocation during the addition process. Adding the hydrogen ion to one carbon atom in the alkene creates a positive charge on the other carbon, forming a carbocation intermediate. The more substituted the carbocation, the more stable it is, due to induction and hyperconjugation. The major product of the addition reaction will be the one formed from the more stable intermediate. Therefore, the major product of the addition of HX (where X is some atom more electronegative than H) to an alkene has the hydrogen atom in the less substituted position and X in the more substituted position. But the other less substituted, less stable carbocation will still be formed at some concentration and will proceed to be the minor product with the opposite, conjugate attachment of X.
==Anti-Markovnikov reactions==
Also called Kharasch effect (named after Morris S. Kharasch), these reactions that do not involve a carbocation intermediate may react through other mechanisms that have regioselectivities not dictated by Markovnikov&#x27;s rule, such as free radical addition. Such reactions are said to be anti-Markovnikov, since the halogen adds to the less substituted carbon, the opposite of a Markovnikov reaction.

The anti-Markovnikov rule can be illustrated using the addition of hydrogen bromide to isobutylene in the presence of benzoyl peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of HBr with substituted alkenes was prototypical in the study of free-radical additions. Early chemists discovered that the reason for the variability in the ratio of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov reaction products was due to the unexpected presence of free radical ionizing substances such as peroxides. The explanation is that the O-O bond in peroxides is relatively weak. With the aid of light, heat, or sometimes even just acting on its own, the O-O bond can split to form 2 radicals. The radical groups can then interact with HBr to produce a Br radical, which then reacts with the double bond. Since the bromine atom is relatively large, it is more likely to encounter and react with the least substituted carbon since this interaction produces less static interactions between the carbon and the bromine radical. Furthermore, similar to a positive charged species, the radical species is most stable when the unpaired electron is in the more substituted position. The radical intermediate is stabilized by hyperconjugation. In the more substituted position, more carbon-hydrogen bonds are aligned with the radical&#x27;s electron deficient molecular orbital. This means that there are greater hyperconjugation effects, so that position is more favorable. In this case, the terminal carbon is a reactant that produces a primary addition product instead of a secondary addition product.
A new method of anti-Markovnikov addition has been described by Hamilton and Nicewicz, who utilize aromatic molecules and light energy from a low-energy diode to turn the alkene into a cation radical.

Anti-Markovnikov behaviour extends to more chemical reactions than additions to alkenes. Anti-Markovnikov behaviour is observed in the hydration of phenylacetylene by auric catalysis, which gives acetophenone; although with a special ruthenium catalyst it provides the other regioisomer 2-phenylacetaldehyde:

Anti-Markovnikov behavior can also manifest itself in certain rearrangement reactions. In a titanium(IV) chloride-catalyzed formal nucleophilic substitution at enantiopure 1 in the scheme below, two products are formed – 2a and 2b Due to the two chiral centers in the target molecule, the carbon carrying chlorine and the carbon carrying the methyl and acetoxyethyl group, four different compounds are to be formed: 1R,2R- (drawn as 2b) 1R,2S- 1S,2R- (drawn as 2a) and 1S,2S- . Therefore, both of the depicted structures will exist in a D- and an L-form. :

This product distribution can be rationalized by assuming that loss of the hydroxy group in 1 gives the tertiary carbocation A, which rearranges to the seemingly less stable secondary carbocation B. Chlorine can approach this center from two faces leading to the observed mixture of isomers.

Another notable example of anti-Markovnikov addition is hydroboration.
