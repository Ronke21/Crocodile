<text>Daniel Adams Butterfield (October 31, 1831 – July 17, 1901) was a New York businessman, a Union general in the American Civil War, and Assistant Treasurer of the United States.

After working for American Express, co-founded by his father, Butterfield served in the Civil War, where he was soon promoted brigadier general, and wounded at Gaines&#x27; Mill. While recuperating, he either wrote or re-wrote a popular bugle-call for burials, called &quot;Taps&quot;. He commanded a division at Fredericksburg, and then became General Joseph Hooker&#x27;s chief of staff for the Army of the Potomac, sharing both the credit for improved morale and responsibility for the licentious behavior that Hooker tolerated in camp. He also became embroiled in Hooker’s political feuds with Generals Ambrose Burnside and George Gordon Meade. When Meade took over the Army from Hooker, he attempted to replace Butterfield, but his chosen candidates preferred to stay in their current assignments, so Butterfield stayed on as chief of staff, to Meade&#x27;s dissatisfaction.

Wounded at Gettysburg, Meade sent Butterfield away to recuperate. He then served in William T. Sherman’s Atlanta campaign, before retiring from front-line service through illness. He later received the Medal of Honor.

In Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s presidential administration, he was Assistant Treasurer of the United States, abusing that position to manipulate the price of gold, and being forced to resign. He then resumed his business career. 

Butterfield’s extensive war archives are displayed at Cold Spring, New York.

==Early life==
Butterfield was born on October 31, 1831, in Utica, New York. He attended Union Academy and then graduated in 1849, from Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he became a member of the Sigma Phi Society. That same year, his father, John Warren Butterfield, founded the express company of Butterfield, Wasson, and Co., which later became the American Express Company. After graduating, Daniel studied law but as he was too young to sit the New York bar exam, he toured the country instead. Upon his return to Utica, he joined the Utica Citizen’s Corps as a private. He was employed in various businesses in New York and the South, including the American Express Company, which had been co-founded by his father, an owner of the Overland Mail Company, stage-coaches, steamships and telegraph lines.

==Civil War==

Butterfield went to New York City as superintendent of the eastern division of his father&#x27;s company. There, he joined the Seventy-First regiment of New York militia as a captain. Shortly after the fall of Fort Sumter, Butterfield joined the Clay Guards of Washington, D.C., as a first sergeant, but subsequently transferred to the 12th New York Volunteer Infantry as a colonel.

He was commissioned brigadier and major general of the Volunteers and commanded a division of the V Corps. He fought at the First Battle of Bull Run on 21 July 1861. He wrote the 1862 Army field manual, &quot;Camp and Outpost Duty for Infantry&quot;.

Butterfield joined Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac for the Peninsula Campaign in the V Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter. In the Seven Days Battles, at Gaines&#x27; Mill on June 27, 1862, he was wounded but demonstrated the bravery that was eventually recognized in 1892, with the Medal of Honor.
Butterfield continued in brigade command at the Second Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Antietam, became division commander and then V Corps commander for the Battle of Fredericksburg. His corps was one of those assaulting through the city before facing an assault from Marye&#x27;s Heights. After the debacles of Fredericksburg and the Mud March, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker replaced Ambrose Burnside as Army of the Potomac commander and Butterfield became Hooker&#x27;s chief of staff in January 1863. Butterfield was promoted to major general of volunteers in March 1863, with a date of rank of November 29, 1862.

Hooker and Butterfield developed a close personal and political relationship. To the disgust of many army generals, their headquarters were frequented by women and liquor, being described as a combination of a &quot;bar and brothel&quot;. Political infighting became rampant in the high command and Butterfield was widely disliked by most of his colleagues. However, in the spring of 1863, the two officers managed to turn around the poor morale of the army and greatly improved food, shelter and medical support. During this period Butterfield introduced another custom that remains in the Army today: the use of distinctive hat or shoulder patches to denote the unit to which a soldier belongs, in this case the corps. He was inspired by the division patches used earlier by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny, but extended those to the full army; Butterfield designed most of the patches himself.

Hooker was replaced after the Battle of Chancellorsville by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, just before the Battle of Gettysburg. Meade distrusted Butterfield, but retained him as chief of staff. Butterfield was wounded at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, and left active duty to convalesce. Meade removed him as chief of staff on July 14, 1863. On July 1, 1863, Butterfield was appointed as colonel of the 5th United States Infantry.

After Gettysburg, Butterfield actively undermined Meade in cooperation with Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles, another crony of Hooker&#x27;s. Although the battle was a great Union victory, Sickles and Butterfield testified to the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War that Meade vacillated and planned as early as July 1, to retreat from Gettysburg, thus damaging his reputation. Butterfield&#x27;s chief evidence for this assertion was the Pipe Creek Circular that Meade had his staff prepare before it became apparent there would be a battle at Gettysburg.

Butterfield returned to duty that fall as chief of staff once again for Hooker, now commanding two corps in the Army of the Cumberland at Chattanooga, Tennessee. When these two depleted corps (the XI and XII Corps) were combined to form the XX Corps, Butterfield was given the 3rd Division, which he led through the first half of Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta Campaign. Illness prevented his continuing with Sherman, resulting in Butterfield&#x27;s assuming light duties at Vicksburg, Mississippi, followed by recruiting and the command of harbor forces in New York.

===&quot;Taps&quot;===
While the Union Army recuperated at Harrison&#x27;s Landing, Virginia, from its grueling withdrawal during the Seven Days Battles, Butterfield experimented with bugle calls and is credited with the composition of &quot;Taps&quot;. He wrote &quot;Taps&quot; to replace the customary firing of three rifle volleys at the end of burials during battle. &quot;Taps&quot; also replaced &quot;Tattoo&quot;, the French bugle call to signal &quot;lights out&quot;. Butterfield&#x27;s bugler, Oliver W. Norton of the 83rd Pennsylvania Volunteers, was the first to sound the new call. Within months, &quot;Taps&quot; was played by buglers in both the Union and Confederate armies. This account has been disputed by some military and musical historians, who maintain Butterfield merely revised an earlier call known as the &quot;Scott Tattoo&quot; and did not compose an original work.

===Medal of Honor===

Rank and organization: Brigadier General, U.S. Volunteers. Place and date: At Gaines Mill, Va., June 27, 1862. Entered service at: Washington, D.C. Born: October 31, 1831, Utica, N.Y. Date of issue: September 26, 1892.

The 1896 Pattern Medal of Honor was awarded to Daniel Butterfield, “for distinguished gallantry in action at Gaines Mills, Va. June 27, 1862”.

Citation: &quot;Seized the colors of the 83d Pennsylvania Volunteers at a critical moment and, under a galling fire of the enemy, encouraged the depleted ranks to renewed exertion.&quot;

==Life after the Civil War==
After the war, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Butterfield Assistant Treasurer of the United States, based on a recommendation by Abel Corbin, Grant&#x27;s brother-in-law. Butterfield agreed to tell Corbin and speculators Jay Gould and James Fisk when the government was planning to sell gold, a market that Fisk and Gould wanted to corner. Butterfield accepted $10,000 from Gould, which Butterfield said was &quot;to cover expenses&quot;. Butterfield later testified to Congress that it was an unsecured real estate loan. If Butterfield tipped them off, then Fisk and Gould would sell their gold before the price dropped. The scheme was uncovered by Grant, who sold $4,000,000 of government gold without telling Butterfield, resulting in the panic of collapsing gold prices known as Black Friday, on September 24, 1869.

Butterfield resigned from the Treasury Department in October 1869. He then became active in business and banking, including an executive position with American Express. He was also active in Union College&#x27;s alumni association and several veterans organizations, including the Grand Army of the Republic.

On September 21, 1886, Butterfield married Mrs. Julia Lorrilard Safford James of New York in a ceremony in London. The Butterfields built a summer residence, &quot;Craigside&quot;, across the Hudson River from West Point in Cold Spring, New York, where Daniel Butterfield died on July 17, 1901. He was buried with an ornate monument in the West Point Cemetery at the United States Military Academy, although he had not attended that institution. &quot;Taps&quot; was sounded at his funeral.

==Legacy==
The Butterfield Paramedic Institute in Cold Spring, New York, which was once a hospital, is named for him.

===Archives===
The Julia L Butterfield Memorial Library in Cold Spring, New York is named for Butterfield&#x27;s wife. The General Daniel Butterfield Civil War Collection is located there and include correspondence from Union generals, telegrams from Secretary of War Stanton and Gen. Sherman as he approached Atlanta, a battle map of Gettysburg, handwritten casualty lists, a manuscript by a field officer detailing the Battle of Gettysburg, and other material.

Bequeathed to the library by his widow in 1927, the collection&#x27;s historical significance was not known until April 2011 when the West Point Museum Director and Chief Curator David Reel reviewed the collection. According to Reel, &quot;The historical importance of the collection is unquestionable as a comprehensive archive of a major figure of the American Civil War and contains documents and letters, telegrams from 1861-64 that are irreplaceable and significant in content. . . No doubt, scholars of United States History and specifically the American Civil War will find a treasure trove of original, period material within the archive.&quot;

There is a statue of the general by Gutzon Borglum in Sakura Park in Manhattan.

===Cragside===
A part of the Butterfield estate, &quot;Cragside&quot;, is named for the rocky cliffs on the property. The house was built from the rock quarried on the property. The property was by all accounts a beautiful estate with elaborate gardens. Some of the stables from the estate are still standing and used by the Haldane Central School District. Cragside was purchased around 1931 by the Fathers of Mercy. Founded in France in early 19th-century, the congregation established the parish of St. Vincent de Paul Church in Manhattan in 1841 for French-speaking Catholics. The Cold Spring property was the location of St. Joseph&#x27;s Novitiate. The structure was destroyed by fire in the late 1970s. The property was later sold, and eventually acquired by the Haldane Central School District. Haldane&#x27;s high school building was built on the property and opened in 2005.

==In popular culture==
Butterfield appears in the Civil War novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by Michael Shaara – a character in the 20th Maine claims that their brigade bugle call was written by Butterfield and is based on his own name.

He was also referenced in the movie &quot;Glory&quot;.

<text>The Louisville Bats are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League (IL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. They are located in Louisville, Kentucky, and are named in dual reference to the winged mammal and baseball bats, such as those manufactured locally under the Louisville Slugger brand. The team plays their home games at Louisville Slugger Field, which opened in 2000. The Bats previously played at Cardinal Stadium from 1982 to 1999.

The club began play as the Louisville Redbirds in the Triple-A American Association (AA) in 1982. Louisville won three AA championships: in 1984, 1985, and 1995 as the top affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. They joined the Triple-A International League in 1998 following the dissolution of the AA after the 1997 season. The Redbirds rebranded as the Louisville RiverBats in 1999; this was shortened to Bats in 2002. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Bats were shifted to the Triple-A East, but this was renamed the International League in 2022. Their lone IL championship was won in 2001 with Cincinnati.

==History==

===American Association (1982–1997)===

In 1982, the St. Louis Cardinals moved their Triple-A team of the American Association (AA), the Springfield Redbirds, from Springfield, Illinois, to Louisville, Kentucky, where they became the Louisville Redbirds. They played their home games at Cardinal Stadium, which was located at the Kentucky Exposition Center and seated over 30,000 people. The stadium previously hosted the Louisville Colonels from 1957 to 1972. 

During their inaugural 1982 season, the Redbirds broke the minor league attendance record by drawing 868,418 people to Cardinal Stadium. On the field, the team narrowly missed the playoffs when they finished in second place, just one-and-a-half games out of first at 73–62. In 1983, the Redbirds became the first minor league team to draw over one million fans in a single season (1,052,438). The team improved to league-best 78–57 and won the Eastern Division title, which qualified them for the postseason. Though Louisville won the semifinals versus the Oklahoma City 89ers, 3–2, they lost the AA championship to the Denver Bears, 4–0, in the finals. Manager Jim Fregosi was selected as the AA Manager of the Year. The franchise was awarded the 1983 John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award, recognizing them as the &quot;complete baseball franchise—based on franchise stability, contributions to league stability, contributions to baseball in the community, and promotion of the baseball industry.&quot;

Fergosi led the Redbirds to win back-to-back American Association championships in 1984 and 1985. The 1984 squad won the semifinals against the Indianapolis Indians, 4–2, before winning their first league title over the Denver Zephyrs, 4–1. Their second came the next season after winning the 1985 Eastern Division title and defeating Oklahoma City, 4–1, in the only round of playoffs. Fergosi won his second Manager of the Year Award for the 1985 campaign.

The 1987 team made a return to the postseason, but they were eliminated by Indianapolis, 3–2, in the semifinals. Outfielder Lance Johnson was honored with both the AA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award and Rookie of the Year Award. Louisville regularly finished third or fourth in their four-team division over the next six seasons. A pair of Redbirds won league awards, however, during this period. René Arocha was selected as the 1992 Most Valuable Pitcher, and catcher Todd Zeile was the 1989 Rookie of the Year. The team qualified for a playoff spot in 1994, but they were quickly swept out of the semifinals, 3–0, by Indianapolis. The Redbirds came back in 1995 to sweep Indianapolis in the semis before winning a third AA championship versus the Buffalo Bisons, 3–2, behind manager Joe Pettini.

===International League (1998–2020)===
Louisville experienced a number of changes around the turn of the millennium. The American Association, of which the Redbirds had been members since 1982, disbanded after the 1997 season. Its teams were absorbed by the two remaining Triple-A leagues—the International League (IL) and Pacific Coast League (PCL), with Louisville joining the IL. Their 16-year relationship with the St. Louis Cardinals also ended after the 1997 season when the Cardinals chose to move their Triple-A affiliation to the Memphis Redbirds, a PCL expansion team. Louisville then became the top farm club of the Milwaukee Brewers in 1998. They started their time in the IL by winning the Western Division title, but in the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs, they were eliminated in the semifinals by the Durham Bulls, 3–0. In 1999, the team rebranded as the Louisville RiverBats. The name was a dual reference to Louisville&#x27;s location on the Ohio River and baseball bats, such as those manufactured locally under the Louisville Slugger brand. Their new logos incorporated a bat (the animal) swinging a baseball bat. After a second season with the Brewers, Louisville entered into a new affiliation with the Cincinnati Reds in 2000. They also left Cardinal Stadium for the new US$27.8 million Louisville Slugger Field. Located in downtown Louisville, the new ballpark seats 13,131 people with a more intimate setting than their previous facility.

In 2001, manager Dave Miley led the RiverBats to an 84–60 record and the Western Division title. They defeated the Norfolk Tides, 3–2, in the semifinals to advance to the final round against the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. Louisville won the first game of the series, 2–1, before the September 11 terrorist attacks resulted in the cancellation of the rest of the playoffs. The RiverBats were declared the International League champions for 2001.

Louisville dropped &quot;River&quot; from its name to become simply the Louisville Bats in 2002. Outfielder Raúl González won that season&#x27;s IL MVP Award. The team returned to the playoffs in 2003, with another division title, but they were ousted in the semifinals by Durham, 3–1. In 2007, first baseman Joey Votto was selected for the IL Rookie of the Year Award. The Bats made three consecutive trips to the postseason from 2008 to 2010 with back-to-back-to-back division titles, but they were eliminated by Durham each time in the semifinals. Rick Sweet won the IL Manager of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009, and Justin Lehr won the Most Valuable Pitcher Award in 2009. Typically finishing third or fourth out of four teams in the Western Division, Louisville did not again qualify for the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs after 2010.

Right fielder Aristides Aquino was selected as the 2019 IL Rookie of the Year. The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled on June 30.

=== Triple-A East / International League (2021–present) ===
Following the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. The Cincinnati Reds retained Louisville as their Triple-A affiliate, but the International League disbanded, and the Bats followed the other IL teams into the Triple-A East. Louisville ended the season in sixth place in the Midwestern Division with a 51–68 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Louisville finished the tournament tied for 18th place with a 4–5 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. In December 2023, the team was purchased by Diamond Baseball Holdings.

==Season-by-season records==


==Logos and colors==
The Louisville Redbirds based their original visual identity on that of their major league parent, the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1982 to 1998. The team&#x27;s uniforms were of red and white, while their logo featured a cardinal preparing to swing a baseball bat. When they rebranded as the RiverBats in 1999, their color scheme became purple and green, while the logo depicted a bat swinging a baseball bat. When this moniker was shortened to &quot;Bats&quot; in 2002, the palette was switched to purple, black, and gold, and the logo to an abstract bat shape. The Bats&#x27; current color scheme of red, navy blue, and white was adopted in 2016. Additionally, the rebranding updated the logo to depict a flying bat in front of a moon, which resembled a baseball, while gripping a baseball bat in its talons.

==Radio and television==

Since 2019, Jim Kelch has been the play-by-play announcer for Bats radio broadcasts. He previously served in the role from 1989 to 2009 before leaving to work for the Cincinnati Reds broadcast team from 2010 to 2017. Other Louisville broadcasters that went on to broadcast for MLB teams include Joe Buck (1989–1990), Todd Kalas (1991), and Mark Neely (1992–1994).

As of 2019, all Bats home and road games were broadcast on WKRD 790 AM. Live audio broadcasts are also available online through the team&#x27;s website and the MiLB First Pitch app. Games can be viewed through the MiLB.TV subscription feature of the official website of Minor League Baseball, with audio provided by a radio simulcast.

<doc id="252812" wikidata="Q144037" url="?curid=252812" title="Calculus (dental)">
<text>In dentistry, calculus or tartar is a form of hardened dental plaque. It is caused by precipitation of minerals from saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in plaque on the teeth. This process of precipitation kills the bacterial cells within dental plaque, but the rough and hardened surface that is formed provides an ideal surface for further plaque formation. This leads to calculus buildup, which compromises the health of the gingiva (gums). Calculus can form both along the gumline, where it is referred to as supragingival (), and within the narrow sulcus that exists between the teeth and the gingiva, where it is referred to as subgingival ().

Calculus formation is associated with a number of clinical manifestations, including bad breath, receding gums and chronically inflamed gingiva. Brushing and flossing can remove plaque from which calculus forms; however, once formed, calculus is too hard (firmly attached) to be removed with a toothbrush. Calculus buildup can be removed with ultrasonic tools or dental hand instruments (such as a periodontal scaler).

==Etymology==
The word comes from Latin , from , probably related to Greek , which many trace to a Proto-Indo-European root for . &quot;Calculus&quot; was a term used for various kinds of stones. This spun off many modern words, including &quot;calculate&quot; (), and &quot;calculus&quot;, which came to be used, in the 18th century, for accidental or incidental mineral buildups in human and animal bodies, like kidney stones and minerals on teeth.

&quot;Tartar&quot;, on the other hand, originates in Greek as well (), but as the term for the white encrustation inside casks (a.k.a. potassium bitartrate, commonly known as cream of tartar). This came to be a term used for calcium phosphate on teeth in the early 19th century.

==Chemical composition==
Calculus is composed of both inorganic (mineral) and organic (cellular and extracellular matrix) components. 

===In supra-gingival calculus===
The mineral proportion of supragingival calculus ranges from approximately 40–60%, depending on its location in the dentition, and consists primarily of calcium phosphate crystals organized into four principal mineral phases, listed here in order of decreasing ratio of phosphate to calcium:
*whitlockite, 
*hydroxyapatite, 
*octacalcium phosphate, 
*and brushite, 

The organic component is approximately 85% cellular and 15% extracellular matrix. Cell density within dental plaque and calculus is very high, consisting of an estimated 200,000,000 cells per milligram. The cells within calculus are primarily bacterial, but also include at least one species of archaea (&quot;Methanobrevibacter oralis&quot;) and several species of yeast (e.g., &quot;Candida albicans&quot;). The organic extracellular matrix in calculus consists primarily of proteins and lipids (fatty acids, triglycerides, glycolipids, and phospholipids), as well as extracellular DNA. Trace amounts of host, dietary, and environmental microdebris are also found within calculus, including salivary proteins, plant DNA, milk proteins, starch granules, textile fibers, and smoke particles.

===In sub-gingival calculus===
Sub-gingival calculus is composed almost entirely of two components: fossilized anaerobic bacteria whose biological composition has been replaced by calcium phosphate salts, and calcium phosphate salts that have joined the fossilized bacteria in calculus formations. 

The following minerals are detectable in calculus by X-ray diffraction: 
* brushite ()
* octacalcium phosphate ()
* magnesium-containing whitlockite ()
* carbonate-containing hydroxyapatite (approximately but containing some carbonate).

==Calculus formation==
Dental calculus typically forms in incremental layers that are easily visible using both electron microscopy and light microscopy. These layers form during periodic calcification events of the dental plaque, but the timing and triggers of these events are not well understood. The formation of calculus varies widely among individuals and at different locations within the mouth. Many variables have been identified that influence the formation of dental calculus, including age, sex, ethnic background, diet, location in the oral cavity, oral hygiene, bacterial plaque composition, host genetics, access to professional dental care, physical disabilities, systemic diseases, tobacco use, and drugs and medications.

Supragingival calculus formation is most abundant on the buccal (cheek) surfaces of the maxillary (upper jaw) molars and on the lingual (tongue) surfaces of the mandibular (lower jaw) incisors. These areas experience high salivary flow because of their proximity to the parotid and sublingual salivary glands. 

Subgingival calculus forms below the gumline and is typically darkened in color by the presence of black-pigmented bacteria, whose cells are coated in a layer of iron obtained from heme during gingival bleeding. The reason fossilized bacteria are initially attracted to one part of the subgingival tooth surface over another is not fully understood. However, once the first layer is attached, more calculus components are naturally attracted to the same places due to electrical charge. This is because the calcium phosphate salts contained in them exist as electrically unstable ions (unlike calcium phosphate, the primary component of teeth). The fossilized bacteria pile up rather haphazardly, while free-floating ionic components (calcium phosphate salts) fill in the gaps.

The resultant hardened structure can be compared to concrete, with the fossilized bacteria playing the role of aggregate, and the smaller calcium phosphate salts being the cement. The &quot;hardened&quot; calculus formations are at the heart of periodontal disease and treatment.

==Clinical significance==

Plaque accumulation causes the gingiva to become irritated and inflamed, and this is referred to as gingivitis. When the gingiva become so irritated that there is a loss of the connective tissue fibers that attach the gums to the teeth and bone that surrounds the tooth, this is known as periodontitis. Dental plaque is not the sole cause of periodontitis; however it is many times referred to as a primary aetiology. Plaque that remains in the oral cavity long enough will eventually calcify and become calculus. Calculus is detrimental to gingival health because it serves as a trap for increased plaque formation and retention; thus, calculus, along with other factors that cause a localized build-up of plaque, is referred to as a secondary aetiology of periodontitis.

When plaque is supragingival, the bacterial content contains a great proportion of aerobic bacteria and yeast, or those bacteria which utilize and can survive in an environment containing oxygen. Subgingival plaque contains a higher proportion of anaerobic bacteria, or those bacteria which cannot exist in an environment containing oxygen. Several anaerobic plaque bacteria, such as &quot;Porphyromonas gingivalis&quot;, secrete antigenic proteins that trigger a strong inflammatory response in the periodontium, the specialized tissues that surround and support the teeth. Prolonged inflammation of the periodontium leads to bone loss and weakening of the gingival fibers that attach the teeth to the gums, two major hallmarks of periodontitis. Supragingival calculus formation is nearly ubiquitous in humans, but to differing degrees. Almost all individuals with periodontitis exhibit considerable subgingival calculus deposits. Dental plaque bacteria have been linked to cardiovascular disease and mothers giving birth to pre-term low weight infants, but there is no conclusive evidence yet that periodontitis is a significant risk factor for either of these two conditions.

==Prevention==
Toothpaste with pyrophosphates or zinc citrate has been shown to produce a statistically significant reduction in plaque accumulation, but the effect of zinc citrate is so modest that its clinical importance is questionable. Some calculus may form even without plaque deposits, by direct mineralisation of the pellicle.

==Calculus in other animals==
Calculus formation in other animals is less well studied than in humans, but it is known to form in a wide range of species. Domestic pets, such as dogs and cats, frequently accumulate large calculus deposits. Animals with highly abrasive diets, such as ruminants and equids, rarely form thick deposits and instead tend to form thin calculus deposits that often have a metallic or opalescent sheen. In animals, calculus should not be confused with crown cementum, a layer of calcified dental tissue that encases the tooth root underneath the gingival margin and is gradually lost through periodontal disease.

== Archaeological significance ==
Dental calculus has been shown to contain well preserved microparticles, DNA and protein in archaeological samples. The information these molecules contain can reveal information about the oral microbiome of the host and the presence of pathogens. It is also possible to identify dietary sources as well as study dietary shifts and occasionally evidence of craft activities.

== Removal of calculus after formation ==

Plaque and calculus deposits are a major etiological factor in the development and progression of oral disease. An important part of the scope of practice of a dental hygienist is the removal of plaque and calculus deposits. This is achieved through the use of specifically designed instruments for debridement of tooth surfaces. Treatment with these types of instruments is necessary as calculus deposits cannot be removed by brushing or flossing alone. To effectively manage disease or maintain oral health, thorough removal of calculus deposits should be completed at frequent intervals. The recommended frequency of dental hygiene treatment can be made by a registered professional, and is dependent on individual patient needs. Factors that are taken into consideration include an individual&#x27;s overall health status, tobacco use, amount of calculus present, and adherence to a professionally recommended home care routine.

Hand instruments are specially designed tools used by dental professionals to remove plaque and calculus deposits that have formed on the teeth. These tools include scalers, curettes, jaquettes, hoes, files and chisels. Each type of tool is designed to be used in specific areas of the mouth. Some commonly used instruments include sickle scalers which are designed with a pointed tip and are mainly used supragingivally. Curettes are mainly used to remove subgingival calculus, smooth root surfaces and to clean out periodontal pockets. Curettes can be divided into two subgroups: universals and area specific instruments. Universal curettes can be used in multiple areas, while area specific instruments are designed for select tooth surfaces. Gracey curettes are a popular type of area specific curettes. Due to their design, area specific curettes allow for better adaptation to the root surface and can be slightly more effective than universals. Hoes, chisels, and files are less widely used than scalers and curettes. These are beneficial when removing large amounts of calculus or tenacious calculus that cannot be removed with a curette or scaler alone. Chisels and hoes are used to remove bands of calculus, whereas files are used to crush burnished or tenacious calculus.

Ultrasonic scalers, also known as power scalers, are effective in removing calculus, stain, and plaque. These scalers are also useful for root planing, curettage, and surgical debridement. Not only is tenacious calculus and stain removed more effectively with ultrasonic scalers than with hand instrumentation alone, it is evident that the most satisfactory clinical results are when ultrasonics are used in adjunct to hand instrumentation. There are two types of ultrasonic scalers; piezoelectric and magnetostrictive. Oscillating material in both of these handpieces cause the tip of the scaler to vibrate at high speeds, between 18,000 and 50,000 Hz. The tip of each scaler uses a different vibration pattern for removal of calculus. The magnetostrictive power scaler vibration is elliptical, activating all sides of the tip, whereas the piezoelectric vibration is linear and is more active on the two sides of the tip.

Special tips for ultrasonic scalers are designed to address different areas of the mouth and varying amounts of calculus buildup. Larger tips are used for heavy subgingival or supragingival calculus deposits, whereas thinner tips are designed more for definitive subgingival debridement. As the high frequency vibrations loosen calculus and plaque, heat is generated at the tip. A water spray is directed towards the end of the tip to cool it as well as irrigate the gingiva during debridement. Only the first 1–2 mm of the tip on the ultrasonic scaler is most effective for removal, and therefore needs to come into direct contact with the calculus to fracture the deposits. Small adaptations are needed in order to keep the tip of the scaler touching the surface of the tooth, while overlapping oblique, horizontal, or vertical strokes are used for adequate calculus removal.

Current research on potentially more effective methods of subgingival calculus removal focuses on the use of near-ultraviolet and near-infrared lasers, such as Er,Cr:YSGG lasers. The use of lasers in periodontal therapy offers a unique clinical advantage over conventional hand instrumentation, as the thin and flexible fibers can deliver laser energy into periodontal pockets that are otherwise difficult to access. Near-infrared lasers, such as the Er,CR:YSGG laser, have been proposed as an effective adjunct for calculus removal as the emission wavelength is highly absorbed by water, a large component of calculus deposits. An optimal output power setting of 1.0-W with the near-infrared Er,Cr:YSGG laser has been shown to be effective for root scaling. Near-ultraviolet lasers have also shown promise as they allow the dental professional to remove calculus deposits quickly, without removing underlying healthy tooth structure, which often occurs during hand instrumentation. Additionally, near-ultraviolet lasers are effective at various irradiation angles for calculus removal. Discrepancies in the efficiency of removal are due to the physical and optical properties of the calculus deposits, not to the angle of laser use. Dental hygienists must receive additional theoretical and clinical training on the use of lasers, where legislation permits.

<text>HSL and HSV are the two most common cylindrical-coordinate representations of points in an RGB color model. The two representations rearrange the geometry of RGB in an attempt to be more intuitive and perceptually relevant than the cartesian (cube) representation. Developed in the 1970s for computer graphics applications, HSL and HSV are used today in color pickers, in image editing software, and less commonly in image analysis and computer vision.

HSL stands for &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;saturation&quot;, and &quot;lightness&quot;, and is often also called HLS. HSV stands for &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;saturation&quot;, and &quot;value&quot;, and is also often called HSB (&quot;B&quot; for &quot;brightness&quot;). A third model, common in computer vision applications, is HSI, for &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;saturation&quot;, and &quot;intensity&quot;. However, while typically consistent, these definitions are not standardized, and any of these abbreviations might be used for any of these three or several other related cylindrical models. (For technical definitions of these terms, see below.)

In each cylinder, the angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to &quot;hue&quot;, the distance from the axis corresponds to &quot;saturation&quot;, and the distance along the axis corresponds to &quot;lightness&quot;, &quot;value&quot; or &quot;brightness&quot;. Note that while &quot;hue&quot; in HSL and HSV refers to the same attribute, their definitions of &quot;saturation&quot; differ dramatically. Because HSL and HSV are simple transformations of device-dependent RGB models, the physical colors they define depend on the colors of the red, green, and blue primaries of the device or of the particular RGB space, and on the gamma correction used to represent the amounts of those primaries. Each unique RGB device therefore has unique HSL and HSV spaces to accompany it, and numerical HSL or HSV values describe a different color for each basis RGB space.

Both of these representations are used widely in computer graphics, and one or the other of them is often more convenient than RGB, but both are also criticized for not adequately separating color-making attributes, or for their lack of perceptual uniformity. Other more computationally intensive models, such as CIELAB or CIECAM02 are said to better achieve these goals.

==Basic principle==
HSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries (), with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the red primary at 0°, passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;achromatic&quot;, or &quot;gray&quot; colors ranging, from top to bottom, white at lightness 1 (value 1) to black at lightness 0 (value 0).

In both geometries, the additive primary and secondary colors – red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta – and linear mixtures between adjacent pairs of them, sometimes called &quot;pure colors&quot;, are arranged around the outside edge of the cylinder with saturation 1. These saturated colors have lightness 0.5 in HSL, while in HSV they have value 1. Mixing these pure colors with black – producing so-called &quot;shades&quot; – leaves saturation unchanged. In HSL, saturation is also unchanged by &quot;tinting&quot; with white, and only mixtures with both black and white – called &quot;tones&quot; – have saturation less than 1. In HSV, tinting alone reduces saturation.

Because these definitions of saturation – in which very dark (in both models) or very light (in HSL) near-neutral colors are considered fully saturated (for instance, from the bottom right in the sliced HSL cylinder or from the top right) – conflict with the intuitive notion of color purity, often a conic or biconic solid is drawn instead (), with what this article calls &quot;chroma&quot; as its radial dimension (equal to the range of the RGB values), instead of saturation (where the saturation is equal to the chroma over the maximum chroma in that slice of the (bi)cone). Confusingly, such diagrams usually label this radial dimension &quot;saturation&quot;, blurring or erasing the distinction between saturation and chroma. As described below, computing chroma is a helpful step in the derivation of each model. Because such an intermediate model – with dimensions hue, chroma, and HSV value or HSL lightness – takes the shape of a cone or bicone, HSV is often called the &quot;hexcone model&quot; while HSL is often called the &quot;bi-hexcone model&quot; ().
==Motivation==

Most televisions, computer displays, and projectors produce colors by combining red, green, and blue light in varying intensities – the so-called RGB additive primary colors. The resulting mixtures in RGB color space can reproduce a wide variety of colors (called a gamut); however, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with subtractive color mixing of paints or traditional artists&#x27; models based on tints and shades (). Furthermore, neither additive nor subtractive color models define color relationships the same way the human eye does.

For example, imagine we have an RGB display whose color is controlled by three sliders ranging from , one controlling the intensity of each of the red, green, and blue primaries. If we begin with a relatively colorful orange , with sRGB values , , , and want to reduce its colorfulness by half to a less saturated orange , we would need to drag the sliders to decrease &quot;R&quot; by 31, increase &quot;G&quot; by 24, and increase &quot;B&quot; by 59, as pictured below.

Beginning in the 1950s, color television broadcasts used a compatible color system whereby &quot;luminance&quot; and &quot;chrominance&quot; signals were encoded separately, so that existing unmodified black-and-white televisions could still receive color broadcasts and show a monochrome image.

In an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color mixing models, computer graphics pioneers at PARC and NYIT introduced the HSV model for computer display technology in the mid-1970s, formally described by Alvy Ray Smith in the August 1978 issue of &quot;Computer Graphics&quot;. In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg described the HSL model – whose dimensions they labeled &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;relative chroma&quot;, and &quot;intensity&quot; – and compared it to HSV (). Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in human vision in terms of other color-making attributes, such as hue, lightness, and chroma; as well as upon traditional color mixing methods – e.g., in painting – that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter, darker, or less colorful colors.

The following year, 1979, at SIGGRAPH, Tektronix introduced graphics terminals using HSL for color designation, and the Computer Graphics Standards Committee recommended it in their annual status report (). These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then. Some of their uses are described below.

==Formal derivation==



===Color-making attributes===

The dimensions of the HSL and HSV geometries – simple transformations of the not-perceptually-based RGB model – are not directly related to the photometric color-making attributes of the same names, as defined by scientists such as the CIE or ASTM. Nonetheless, it is worth reviewing those definitions before leaping into the derivation of our models. For the definitions of color-making attributes which follow, see:

; Hue: The &quot;attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them&quot;.
; Radiance (&quot;L&quot;e,Ω): The radiant power of light passing through a particular surface per unit solid angle per unit projected area, measured in SI units in watt per steradian per square metre ().
; Luminance (&quot;Y&quot; or &quot;L&quot;v,Ω): The radiance weighted by the effect of each wavelength on a typical human observer, measured in SI units in candela per square meter (). Often the term &quot;luminance&quot; is used for the relative luminance, &quot;Y&quot;/&quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the luminance of the reference white point.
; Luma (&quot;&quot;): The weighted sum of gamma-corrected , , and values, and used in , for JPEG compression and video transmission.
; Brightness (or value): The &quot;attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to emit more or less light&quot;.
; Lightness: The &quot;brightness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white&quot;.
; Colorfulness: The &quot;attribute of a visual sensation according to which the perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic&quot;.
; Chroma: The &quot;colorfulness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white&quot;.
; Saturation: The &quot;colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness&quot;.

&quot;Brightness&quot; and &quot;colorfulness&quot; are absolute measures, which usually describe the spectral distribution of light entering the eye, while &quot;lightness&quot; and &quot;chroma&quot; are measured relative to some white point, and are thus often used for descriptions of surface colors, remaining roughly constant even as brightness and colorfulness change with different illumination. &quot;Saturation&quot; can be defined as either the ratio of colorfulness to brightness, or that of chroma to lightness.

===General approach===
HSL, HSV, and related models can be derived via geometric strategies, or can be thought of as specific instances of a &quot;generalized LHS model&quot;. The HSL and HSV model-builders took an RGB cube – with constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light in a color denoted – and tilted it on its corner, so that black rested at the origin with white directly above it along the vertical axis, then measured the hue of the colors in the cube by their angle around that axis, starting with red at 0°. Then they came up with a characterization of brightness/value/lightness, and defined saturation to range from 0 along the axis to 1 at the most colorful point for each pair of other parameters.

===Hue and chroma===

In each of our models, we calculate both &quot;hue&quot; and what this article will call &quot;chroma&quot;, after Joblove and Greenberg (1978), in the same way – that is, the hue of a color has the same numerical values in all of these models, as does its chroma. If we take our tilted RGB cube, and project it onto the &quot;chromaticity plane&quot; perpendicular to the neutral axis, our projection takes the shape of a hexagon, with red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta at its corners (). &quot;Hue&quot; is roughly the angle of the vector to a point in the projection, with red at 0°, while &quot;chroma&quot; is roughly the distance of the point from the origin.

More precisely, both hue and chroma in this model are defined with respect to the hexagonal shape of the projection. The &quot;chroma&quot; is the proportion of the distance from the origin to the edge of the hexagon. In the lower part of the adjacent diagram, this is the ratio of lengths , or alternatively the ratio of the radii of the two hexagons. This ratio is the difference between the largest and smallest values among &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, or &quot;B&quot; in a color. To make our definitions easier to write, we&#x27;ll define these maximum, minimum, and chroma component values as &quot;M&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;, respectively.
: formula_1
: formula_2
: formula_3

To understand why chroma can be written as , notice that any neutral color, with , projects onto the origin and so has 0 chroma. Thus if we add or subtract the same amount from all three of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot;, we move vertically within our tilted cube, and do not change the projection. Therefore, any two colors of and project on the same point, and have the same chroma. The chroma of a color with one of its components equal to zero is simply the maximum of the other two components. This chroma is &quot;M&quot; in the particular case of a color with a zero component, and in general.

The &quot;hue&quot; is the proportion of the distance around the edge of the hexagon which passes through the projected point, originally measured on the range but now typically measured in degrees . For points which project onto the origin in the chromaticity plane (i.e., grays), hue is undefined. Mathematically, this definition of hue is written piecewise:
: formula_4
: formula_5

Sometimes, neutral colors (i.e. with ) are assigned a hue of 0° for convenience of representation.
These definitions amount to a geometric warping of hexagons into circles: each side of the hexagon is mapped linearly onto a 60° arc of the circle (). After such a transformation, hue is precisely the angle around the origin and chroma the distance from the origin: the angle and magnitude of the vector pointing to a color.
Sometimes for image analysis applications, this hexagon-to-circle transformation is skipped, and &quot;hue&quot; and &quot;chroma&quot; (we&#x27;ll denote these &quot;H&quot;2 and &quot;C&quot;2) are defined by the usual cartesian-to-polar coordinate transformations (). The easiest way to derive those is via a pair of cartesian chromaticity coordinates which we&#x27;ll call &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;:
: formula_6
: formula_7
: formula_8
: formula_9
(The atan2 function, a &quot;two-argument arctangent&quot;, computes the angle from a cartesian coordinate pair.)

Notice that these two definitions of hue (&quot;H&quot; and &quot;H&quot;2) nearly coincide, with a maximum difference between them for any color of about 1.12° – which occurs at twelve particular hues, for instance , – and with for every multiple of 30°. The two definitions of chroma (&quot;C&quot; and &quot;C&quot;2) differ more substantially: they are equal at the corners of our hexagon, but at points halfway between two corners, such as , we have , but formula_10 a difference of about 13.4%.

=== Lightness===

While the definition of &quot;hue&quot; is relatively uncontroversial – it roughly satisfies the criterion that colors of the same perceived hue should have the same numerical hue – the definition of a &quot;lightness&quot; or &quot;value&quot; dimension is less obvious: there are several possibilities depending on the purpose and goals of the representation. Here are four of the most common (; three of these are also shown in ):

* The simplest definition is just the arithmetic mean, i.e. average, of the three components, in the HSI model called &quot;intensity&quot; (). This is simply the projection of a point onto the neutral axis – the vertical height of a point in our tilted cube. The advantage is that, together with Euclidean-distance calculations of hue and chroma, this representation preserves distances and angles from the geometry of the RGB cube.
*: formula_11
* In the HSV &quot;hexcone&quot; model, &quot;value&quot; is defined as the largest component of a color, our &quot;M&quot; above (). This places all three primaries, and also all of the &quot;secondary colors&quot; – cyan, yellow, and magenta – into a plane with white, forming a hexagonal pyramid out of the RGB cube.
*: formula_12
* In the HSL &quot;bi-hexcone&quot; model, &quot;lightness&quot; is defined as the average of the largest and smallest color components (), i.e. the mid-range of the RGB components. This definition also puts the primary and secondary colors into a plane, but a plane passing halfway between white and black. The resulting color solid is a double-cone similar to Ostwald&#x27;s, shown above.
*: formula_13
* A more perceptually relevant alternative is to use &quot;luma&quot;, , as a lightness dimension (). Luma is the weighted average of gamma-corrected &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot;, based on their contribution to perceived lightness, long used as the monochromatic dimension in color television broadcast. For sRGB, the Rec. 709 primaries yield , digital NTSC uses according to Rec. 601 and some other primaries are also in use which result in different coefficients.
*: formula_14 (SDTV)
*: formula_15 (Adobe)
*: formula_16 (HDTV)
*: formula_17 (UHDTV, HDR)

All four of these leave the neutral axis alone. That is, for colors with , any of the four formulations yields a lightness equal to the value of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, or &quot;B&quot;.

For a graphical comparison, see fig. 13 below.

===Saturation===

When encoding colors in a hue/lightness/chroma or hue/value/chroma model (using the definitions from the previous two sections), not all combinations of lightness (or value) and chroma are meaningful: that is, half of the colors denotable using , , and fall outside the RGB gamut (the gray parts of the slices in figure 14). The creators of these models considered this a problem for some uses. For example, in a color selection interface with two of the dimensions in a rectangle and the third on a slider, half of that rectangle is made of unused space. Now imagine we have a slider for lightness: the user&#x27;s intent when adjusting this slider is potentially ambiguous: how should the software deal with out-of-gamut colors? Or conversely, If the user has selected as colorful as possible a dark purple and then shifts the lightness slider upward, what should be done: would the user prefer to see a lighter purple still as colorful as possible for the given hue and lightness or a lighter purple of exactly the same chroma as the original color 

To solve problems such as these, the HSL and HSV models scale the chroma so that it always fits into the range for every combination of hue and lightness or value, calling the new attribute &quot;saturation&quot; in both cases (fig. 14). To calculate either, simply divide the chroma by the maximum chroma for that value or lightness.
: formula_18
:formula_19

The HSI model commonly used for computer vision, which takes &quot;H&quot;2 as a hue dimension and the component average &quot;I&quot; (&quot;intensity&quot;) as a lightness dimension, does not attempt to &quot;fill&quot; a cylinder by its definition of saturation. Instead of presenting color choice or modification interfaces to end users, the goal of HSI is to facilitate separation of shapes in an image. Saturation is therefore defined in line with the psychometric definition: chroma relative to lightness (). See the Use in image analysis section of this article.
: formula_20

Using the same name for these three different definitions of saturation leads to some confusion, as the three attributes describe substantially different color relationships; in HSV and HSI, the term roughly matches the psychometric definition, of a chroma of a color relative to its own lightness, but in HSL it does not come close. Even worse, the word &quot;saturation&quot; is also often used for one of the measurements we call chroma above (&quot;C&quot; or &quot;C&quot;2).

===Examples===
All parameter values shown below are given as values in the interval , except those for &quot;H&quot; and &quot;H&quot;2, which are in the interval .

==Use in end-user software==


The original purpose of HSL and HSV and similar models, and their most common current application, is in color selection tools. At their simplest, some such color pickers provide three sliders, one for each attribute. Most, however, show a two-dimensional slice through the model, along with a slider controlling which particular slice is shown. The latter type of GUI exhibits great variety, because of the choice of cylinders, hexagonal prisms, or cones/bicones that the models suggest (see the diagram near the top of the page). Several color choosers from the 1990s are shown to the right, most of which have remained nearly unchanged in the intervening time: today, nearly every computer color chooser uses HSL or HSV, at least as an option. Some more sophisticated variants are designed for choosing whole sets of colors, basing their suggestions of compatible colors on the HSL or HSV relationships between them.

Most web applications needing color selection also base their tools on HSL or HSV, and pre-packaged open source color choosers exist for most major web front-end frameworks. The CSS 3 specification allows web authors to specify colors for their pages directly with HSL coordinates.

HSL and HSV are sometimes used to define gradients for data visualization, as in maps or medical images. For example, the popular GIS program ArcGIS historically applied customizable HSV-based gradients to numerical geographical data.
Image editing software also commonly includes tools for adjusting colors with reference to HSL or HSV coordinates, or to coordinates in a model based on the &quot;intensity&quot; or luma defined above. In particular, tools with a pair of &quot;hue&quot; and &quot;saturation&quot; sliders are commonplace, dating to at least the late-1980s, but various more complicated color tools have also been implemented. For instance, the Unix image viewer and color editor xv allowed six user-definable hue (&quot;H&quot;) ranges to be rotated and resized, included a dial-like control for saturation (&quot;S&quot;&quot;HSV&quot;), and a curves-like interface for controlling value (&quot;V&quot;) – see fig. 17. The image editor Picture Window Pro includes a &quot;color correction&quot; tool which affords complex remapping of points in a hue/saturation plane relative to either HSL or HSV space.

Video editors also use these models. For example, both Avid and Final Cut Pro include color tools based on HSL or a similar geometry for use adjusting the color in video. With the Avid tool, users pick a vector by clicking a point within the hue/saturation circle to shift all the colors at some lightness level (shadows, mid-tones, highlights) by that vector.

Since version 4.0, Adobe Photoshop&#x27;s &quot;Luminosity&quot;, &quot;Hue&quot;, &quot;Saturation&quot;, and &quot;Color&quot; blend modes composite layers using a luma/chroma/hue color geometry. These have been copied widely, but several imitators use the HSL (e.g. PhotoImpact, Paint Shop Pro) or HSV geometries instead.
==Use in image analysis==

HSL, HSV, HSI, or related models are often used in computer vision and image analysis for feature detection or image segmentation. The applications of such tools include object detection, for instance in robot vision; object recognition, for instance of faces, text, or license plates; content-based image retrieval; and analysis of medical images.

For the most part, computer vision algorithms used on color images are straightforward extensions to algorithms designed for grayscale images, for instance k-means or fuzzy clustering of pixel colors, or canny edge detection. At the simplest, each color component is separately passed through the same algorithm. It is important, therefore, that the features of interest can be distinguished in the color dimensions used. Because the &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; components of an object&#x27;s color in a digital image are all correlated with the amount of light hitting the object, and therefore with each other, image descriptions in terms of those components make object discrimination difficult. Descriptions in terms of hue/lightness/chroma or hue/lightness/saturation are often more relevant.

Starting in the late 1970s, transformations like HSV or HSI were used as a compromise between effectiveness for segmentation and computational complexity. They can be thought of as similar in approach and intent to the neural processing used by human color vision, without agreeing in particulars: if the goal is object detection, roughly separating hue, lightness, and chroma or saturation is effective, but there is no particular reason to strictly mimic human color response. John Kender&#x27;s 1976 master&#x27;s thesis proposed the HSI model. Ohta et al. (1980) instead used a model made up of dimensions similar to those we have called , &quot;α&quot;, and &quot;β&quot;. In recent years, such models have continued to see wide use, as their performance compares favorably with more complex models, and their computational simplicity remains compelling.
==Disadvantages==

While HSL, HSV, and related spaces serve well enough to, for instance, choose a single color, they ignore much of the complexity of color appearance. Essentially, they trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, from a time in computing history (high-end 1970s graphics workstations, or mid-1990s consumer desktops) when more sophisticated models would have been too computationally expensive.

HSL and HSV are simple transformations of RGB which preserve symmetries in the RGB cube unrelated to human perception, such that its &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; corners are equidistant from the neutral axis, and equally spaced around it. If we plot the RGB gamut in a more perceptually-uniform space, such as CIELAB (see below), it becomes immediately clear that the red, green, and blue primaries do not have the same lightness or chroma, or evenly spaced hues. Furthermore, different RGB displays use different primaries, and so have different gamuts. Because HSL and HSV are defined purely with reference to some RGB space, they are not absolute color spaces: to specify a color precisely requires reporting not only HSL or HSV values, but also the characteristics of the RGB space they are based on, including the gamma correction in use.

If we take an image and extract the hue, saturation, and lightness or value components, and then compare these to the components of the same name as defined by color scientists, we can quickly see the difference, perceptually. For example, examine the following images of a fire breather (). The original is in the sRGB colorspace. CIELAB &quot;L&quot;* is a CIE-defined achromatic lightness quantity (dependent solely on the perceptually achromatic luminance &quot;Y&quot;, but not the mixed-chromatic components &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Z&quot;, of the CIEXYZ colorspace from which the sRGB colorspace itself is derived), and it is plain that this appears similar in perceptual lightness to the original color image. Luma is roughly similar, but differs somewhat at high chroma, where it deviates most from depending solely on the true achromatic luminance (&quot;Y&quot;, or equivalently &quot;L&quot;*) and is influenced by the colorimetric chromaticity (&quot;x,y&quot;, or equivalently, &quot;a*,b*&quot; of CIELAB). HSL &quot;L&quot; and HSV &quot;V&quot;, by contrast, diverge substantially from perceptual lightness.


Though none of the dimensions in these spaces match their perceptual analogs, the &quot;value&quot; of HSV and the &quot;saturation&quot; of HSL are particular offenders. In HSV, the blue primary and white are held to have the same value, even though perceptually the blue primary has somewhere around 10% of the luminance of white (the exact fraction depends on the particular RGB primaries in use). In HSL, a mix of 100% red, 100% green, 90% blue – that is, a very light yellow – is held to have the same saturation as the green primary even though the former color has almost no chroma or saturation by the conventional psychometric definitions. Such perversities led Cynthia Brewer, expert in color scheme choices for maps and information displays, to tell the American Statistical Association:

If these problems make HSL and HSV problematic for choosing colors or color schemes, they make them much worse for image adjustment. HSL and HSV, as Brewer mentioned, confound perceptual color-making attributes, so that changing any dimension results in non-uniform changes to all three perceptual dimensions, and distorts all of the color relationships in the image. For instance, rotating the hue of a pure dark blue toward green will also reduce its perceived chroma, and increase its perceived lightness (the latter is grayer and lighter), but the same hue rotation will have the opposite impact on lightness and chroma of a lighter bluish-green – to (the latter is more colorful and slightly darker). In the example below (), the image (a) is the original photograph of a green turtle. In the image (b), we have rotated the hue (&quot;H&quot;) of each color by , while keeping HSV value and saturation or HSL lightness and saturation constant. In the image right (c), we make the same rotation to the HSL/HSV hue of each color, but then we force the CIELAB lightness (&quot;L&quot;*, a decent approximation of perceived lightness) to remain constant. Notice how the hue-shifted middle version without such a correction dramatically changes the perceived lightness relationships between colors in the image. In particular, the turtle&#x27;s shell is much darker and has less contrast, and the background water is much lighter. Image (d) uses CIELAB to hue shift; the difference from (c) demonstrates the errors in hue and saturation.

Because hue is a circular quantity, represented numerically with a discontinuity at 360°, it is difficult to use in statistical computations or quantitative comparisons: analysis requires the use of circular statistics. Furthermore, hue is defined piecewise, in 60° chunks, where the relationship of lightness, value, and chroma to &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; depends on the hue chunk in question. This definition introduces discontinuities, corners which can plainly be seen in horizontal slices of HSL or HSV.

Charles Poynton, digital video expert, lists the above problems with HSL and HSV in his &quot;Color FAQ&quot;, and concludes that:

==Other cylindrical-coordinate color models==

The creators of HSL and HSV were far from the first to imagine colors fitting into conic or spherical shapes, with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis, and hues corresponding to angles around that axis. Similar arrangements date back to the 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models.

==Color conversion formulae==
To convert from HSL or HSV to RGB, we essentially invert the steps listed above (as before, ). First, we compute chroma, by multiplying saturation by the maximum chroma for a given lightness or value. Next, we find the point on one of the bottom three faces of the RGB cube which has the same hue and chroma as our color (and therefore projects onto the same point in the chromaticity plane). Finally, we add equal amounts of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; to reach the proper lightness or value.

=== To RGB ===
====HSL to RGB====

Given a color with hue , saturation , and lightness , we first find chroma:
: formula_21

Then we can find a point along the bottom three faces of the RGB cube, with the same hue and chroma as our color (using the intermediate value &quot;X&quot; for the second largest component of this color):
: formula_22
: formula_23
In the above equation, the notation formula_24 refers to the remainder of the Euclidean division of formula_25 by 2. formula_25 is not necessarily an integer.
: formula_27

When formula_25 is an integer, the &quot;neighbouring&quot; formula would yield the same result, as formula_29 or formula_30, as appropriate.

Finally, we can find &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; by adding the same amount to each component, to match lightness:

: formula_31
: formula_32

===== HSL to RGB alternative =====

The polygonal piecewise functions can be somewhat simplified by clever use of minimum and maximum values as well as the remainder operation.

Given a color with hue formula_33, saturation formula_34, and lightness formula_35, we first define the function:
: formula_36

where formula_37 and:

: formula_38
: formula_39

And output R,G,B values (from formula_40) are:

: formula_41

The above alternative formulas allow for shorter implementations. In the above formulas the formula_42 operation also returns the fractional part of the module e.g. formula_43, and formula_44. 

The base shape formula_45 is constructed as follows: formula_46 is a &quot;triangle&quot; for which values greater or equal to −1 start from k=2 and end at k=10, and the highest point is at k=6. Then by formula_47 we change values bigger than 1 to equal 1. Then by formula_48 we change values less than −1 to equal −1. At this point, we get something similar to the red shape from fig. 24 after a vertical flip (where the maximum is 1 and the minimum is −1). The R,G,B functions of use this shape transformed in the following way: modulo-shifted on (by ) (differently for R,G,B) scaled on (by formula_49) and shifted on (by ). 

We observe the following shape properties (Fig. 24 can help to get an intuition about them):

: formula_50
: formula_51
: formula_52

====HSV to RGB====

Given an HSV color with hue , saturation , and value , we can use the same strategy. First, we find chroma:
: formula_53

Then we can, again, find a point along the bottom three faces of the RGB cube, with the same hue and chroma as our color (using the intermediate value &quot;X&quot; for the second largest component of this color):

: formula_22
: formula_55
: formula_56

As before, when formula_25 is an integer, &quot;neighbouring&quot; formulas would yield the same result.

Finally, we can find &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; by adding the same amount to each component, to match value:
: formula_58
: formula_59

===== HSV to RGB alternative =====

Given a color with hue formula_33, saturation formula_61, and value formula_62, first we define function :
: formula_63
where formula_37 and:
: formula_65

And output R,G,B values (from formula_40) are:
: formula_67

Above alternative equivalent formulas allow shorter implementation. In above formulas the formula_42 returns also fractional part of module e.g. the formula formula_43. The values of formula_70. The base shape
: formula_71 
is constructed as follows: formula_72 is &quot;triangle&quot; for which non-negative values starts from k=0, highest point at k=2 and &quot;ends&quot; at k=4, then we change values bigger than one to one by formula_73, then change negative values to zero by formula_74 – and we get (for formula_75) something similar to green shape from Fig. 24 (which max value is 1 and min value is 0). The R,G,B functions of use this shape transformed in following way: modulo-shifted on (by ) (differently for R,G,B) scaled on (by formula_76) and shifted on (by ). We observe following shape properties(Fig. 24 can help to get intuition about this):
: formula_77
: formula_78
: formula_79

====HSI to RGB====
Given an HSI color with hue , saturation , and intensity , we can use the same strategy, in a slightly different order:
: formula_22
: formula_81
: formula_82
: formula_83

Where formula_84 is the chroma.

Then we can, again, find a point along the bottom three faces of the RGB cube, with the same hue and chroma as our color (using the intermediate value &quot;X&quot; for the second largest component of this color):
: formula_85

Overlap (when formula_25 is an integer) occurs because two ways to calculate the value are equivalent: formula_29 or formula_30, as appropriate.

Finally, we can find &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; by adding the same amount to each component, to match lightness:
: formula_89
: formula_59

====Luma, chroma and hue to RGB====
Given a color with hue , chroma , and luma , we can again use the same strategy. Since we already have &quot;H&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, we can straightaway find our point along the bottom three faces of the RGB cube:
: formula_91
: formula_85

Overlap (when formula_25 is an integer) occurs because two ways to calculate the value are equivalent: formula_29 or formula_30, as appropriate.

Then we can find &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; by adding the same amount to each component, to match luma:
: formula_96
: formula_59

=== Interconversion ===

This is a reiteration of the previous conversion.

<text>Eugeen Van Mieghem (; October 1, 1875 – March 24, 1930) was an artist born in the port city of Antwerp, Belgium. As a boy Van Mieghem was confronted with the harsh reality of life at the waterfront.

Even at primary school he showed a talent for drawing. He was introduced to the work of Vincent van Gogh, Georges Seurat, Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and others at an exhibition organised by Flemish painter and architect Henry van de Velde at the Antwerp Academy around 1892. He attended the Antwerp Academy but was sent from school because his conservative teachers disliked his subject matter and his free, spontaneous way with it. He threw his lot in with progressive political and cultural movements, and joined an anarchist group. By the early 1900s was recognized as one of the most promising young artists of the Antwerp school. He would never renounce his idealism. He became the artist of the typical harbour folk: sack porters, sack makers, emigrants, dockers, bargees, and tramps.

Van Mieghem had his first taste of real success at La Libre Esthétique in Brussels, where his pastels and drawings hung alongside works by French impressionists such as Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Jean Renoir and Édouard Vuillard.

Van Mieghem married Augustine Pautre in 1902. At the end of November 1904 his young wife fell ill. Van Mieghem depicted her in an impressive series of drawings and pastels that rate alongside similar work by artists such as Rembrandt (The Series of Saskia) and Ferdinand Hodler (Valentine Godé). Grief-stricken at the death of his wife, it was not before 1910 until Van Mieghem showed his work again.

After his first individual exhibition at Antwerp&#x27;s Royal Society of Fine Arts in 1912, international interest in his work mounted and group exhibitions followed in Cologne and The Hague. In March 1919 he showed his wartime work in Antwerp. This remarkable series of mainly drawings and pastels met with the wide approval of art critics, who compared this work to that of Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen, Jean-Louis Forain, and Käthe Kollwitz. After an article by his friend and Flemish author Willem Elsschot appeared, Van Mieghem was also able to show his wartime work in a gallery in Scheveningen in The Netherlands. In 1929 he became a teacher of life drawing at the Academy in Antwerp and he participated in exhibitions every year until his death in 1930.

In European social art of the turn of the century, international art critics compare his work to that of figures like Käthe Kollwitz, de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Steinlen. Van Mieghem had no equal when it came down to drawing and painting the lives of ordinary people, living and working in an international seaport. When it comes to capturing social reality, his work has much of the power and authenticity of Jean-François Millet&#x27;s. Like the precursor of social art, Van Mieghem never had to leave his own environment in search of subjects. The world was on his doorstep.

In recent years Van Mieghem&#x27;s work has been rediscovered internationally. In 2000 a Steinlen retrospective at the Picasso Museum in Barcelona included seven of his works and brought international recognition for his work. In 1993, the Eugeen Van Mieghem Museum opened its doors in Antwerp, with a collection of 150 of his works. In 2017 the Hugh Lane Gallery (Dublin, Ireland) exhibited several of his works.

<text>Roger D. Fisher (May 28, 1922 – August 25, 2012) was a Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and director of the Harvard Negotiation Project.

==Background==
Fisher specialized in negotiation and conflict management. He was the co-author (with William Ury) of the book &quot;Getting to Yes&quot;, about &quot;interest-based&quot; negotiation, as well as numerous other publications. After serving in World War II as a weather reconnaissance pilot, Fisher worked on the Marshall Plan in Paris under W. Averell Harriman. After finishing his law degree at Harvard, he worked with the Washington, DC, law firm of Covington &amp; Burling, arguing several cases before the US Supreme Court and advising on several international disputes. He returned to Harvard Law School and became a professor there in 1958. After having lost many of his friends in the war and seeing so many costly disputes as a litigator, Fisher became intrigued with the art and science of how we manage our differences. Fisher and his students at the Harvard Negotiation Project (founded in 1979) began interviewing people who were known as skilled negotiators in order to understand what made them effective. And he started his study of conflict with the question, &quot;What advice could I give to both parties in a dispute that would be helpful and lead to better outcomes?&quot; This work led to the draft, &quot;International Mediation: A Working Guide&quot; (April 1978), and, eventually, to the international best-seller &quot;Getting to Yes&quot;.

In the late 1960s, Fisher conceived of a court-style debate show that handled one contemporary policy issue each week. &quot;The Advocates&quot; premiered in October 1969 on WGBH-TV.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Fisher and his colleagues taught courses on negotiation and conflict management at Harvard, but they also worked as advisors on real negotiations and conflicts of all types worldwide, including peace processes, hostage crises, diplomatic negotiations, and commercial and legal negotiations and disputes. Fisher believed that keeping one foot in the real world helping people with real disputes was critical to producing theory and tools useful in the real world.

Fisher continued to teach and write until his eighties. Follow-up books expanded his thinking about dealing with relationship challenges (&quot;Getting Together&quot; with Scott Brown), preparing effectively (&quot;Getting Ready to Negotiate&quot; with Danny Ertel), tools for dealing with bad actors and challenging parties (&quot;Beyond Machiavelli&quot; with Elizabeth Kopelman and Andrea Kupfer Schneider), galvanizing a group to do effective problem-solving (&quot;Getting It Done: How to Lead When You&#x27;re Not in Charge&quot; with Alan Sharp and John Richardson), and the role of emotions in working relationships (&quot;Beyond Reason&quot; with Daniel Shapiro). In addition, colleagues at the Harvard Negotiation Project expanded the tradition Fisher founded and led. William Ury published &quot;Getting to Peace&quot; (1999), &quot;Getting Past No&quot; (1993), &quot;The Third Side: Why We Fight and How We Can Stop&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Power of a Positive No&quot; (2007). Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton and Sheila Heen produced &quot;Difficult Conversations: How to Talk About What Matters Most&quot; (1999).

Fisher&#x27;s 2005 work, &quot;&quot; (with co-author Daniel Shapiro, a Harvard psychologist) identifies five &quot;core concerns&quot; that everyone cares about: autonomy, affiliation, appreciation, status, and role. The book shows how to use the core concerns to stimulate helpful emotions in negotiations ranging from the personal to international. In &quot;Beyond Reason&quot;, Fisher documents many of his first-hand experiences negotiating around the world, from his involvement in negotiating the Iran hostage crisis to his advisory role in helping Jamil Mahuad, President of Ecuador (1998–2000), resolve a long-standing international border dispute.

Fisher received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Harvard in 1943 and his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1948. He taught at Harvard from 1958 to 1992.

In 1984, Fisher founded the Conflict Management Group (CMG) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. CMG specialized in facilitating negotiations in conflicts worldwide. CMG merged with the Mercy Corps humanitarian group in 2004. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the International Editorial Board of the Cambridge Review of International Affairs.

==International work==
Throughout his career, Fisher made significant efforts to seek peace in the Middle East. Among these efforts included his involvement in Egyptian President Anwar Sadat&#x27;s trip to Jerusalem and the Camp David summit that led to an Israeli–Egyptian peace treaty. In this latter case, he helped devise a process called the one-text, where a facilitator shuttled back and forth between the parties, refining a proposed document until it could not satisfy the parties interests more effectively, at which point the parties either approve the document or agree to start from scratch. President Carter and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance created 23 drafts in 13 days before they had a proposal to which both sides could agree.

He advised both the Iranian and United States governments in negotiations for the release of the American hostages in 1981 where his work helped lead to the breakthrough that enabled the resolution.

In the 1980s, Fisher worked to bring peace to El Salvador.

Later in his career, he helped resolve the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute. Jamil Mahuad, the president of Ecuador and a former student of Fisher&#x27;s asked for Fisher&#x27;s advice soon after taking power in 1998. Fisher, worried that domestic hardliners could cause either president to use the negotiations to posture, advised President Mahuad to avoid the typical photograph of the two presidents shaking hands and instead get a photograph of them sitting side-by-side working off a common document. This photograph helped signal to the public in each country that the presidents would not be taking an adversarial approach to the negotiation and helped lower rhetoric on both sides.

In South Africa, Fisher worked on the negotiations and constitutional process that led to the end of apartheid. From the 1980s to the mid 1990s, at the direction of then Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Bishop Joseph Seoka, he and his colleagues at the Conflict Management group, the African National Congress, the National Party, the Dutch Reformed Church, the Azanian People&#x27;s Organization, and the Inkatha Freedom Party taught interest-based negotiation processes to the leaders of all the factions as well as advised them and their negotiators. The lead constitutional negotiators, Cyril Ramaphosa and Roelf Meyer, later stated in an interview that the cooperative interest-based negotiation process taught by Fisher and his team was the approach that they, their principals, and their constituencies used to hammer out the new constitution and democratic elections processes.

==Preventing nuclear war==
Fisher was known for a unique idea towards nuclear deterrence. In a March 1981 article in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, while discussing the importance on reaching a &quot;wise decision&quot;, especially in terms of nuclear arms, he suggested implanting the nuclear launch codes in a volunteer. If the President of the United States wanted to activate nuclear weapons, he would be required to kill the volunteer to retrieve the codes.

<doc id="252827" wikidata="Q2325624" url="?curid=252827" title="RGBA color model">
<text>RGBA stands for red green blue alpha. While it is sometimes described as a color space, it is actually a three-channel RGB color model supplemented with a fourth &quot;alpha channel&quot;. Alpha indicates how opaque each pixel is and allows an image to be combined over others using alpha compositing, with transparent areas and anti-aliasing of the edges of opaque regions. Each pixel is a 4D vector.

The term does &quot;not&quot; define what RGB color space is being used. It also does not state whether or not the colors are premultiplied by the alpha value, and if they are it does not state what color space that premultiplication was done in. This means more information than just &quot;RGBA&quot; is needed to determine how to handle an image.

In some contexts the abbreviation &quot;RGBA&quot; means a specific memory layout (called RGBA8888 below), with other terms such as &quot;BGRA&quot; used for alternatives. In other contexts &quot;RGBA&quot; means any layout.

== Representation ==

In computer graphics, pixels encoding the RGBA color space information must be stored in computer memory (or in files on disk). In most cases four equal-sized pieces of adjacent memory are used, one for each channel, and a 0 in a channel indicates black color or transparent alpha, while all-1 bits indicates white or fully opaque alpha. By far the most common format is to store 8 bits (one byte) for each channel, which is 32 bits for each pixel.

The &quot;order&quot; of these four bytes in memory can differ, which can lead to confusion when image data is exchanged. These encodings are often denoted by the four letters in some order (most commonly RGBA). The interpretation of these 4-letter mnemonics is not well established. There are two typical ways to understand the mnemonic &quot;RGBA&quot;:

* In the byte-order scheme, &quot;RGBA&quot; is understood to mean a byte R, followed by a byte G, followed by a byte B, and followed by a byte A. This scheme is commonly used for describing file formats or network protocols, which are both byte-oriented.
* In the word-order scheme, &quot;RGBA&quot; is understood to represent a complete 32-bit word, where R is more significant than G, which is more significant than B, which is more significant than A.

In a big-endian system, the two schemes are equivalent. This is not the case for a little-endian system, where the two mnemonics are reverses of each other. Therefore, to be unambiguous, it is important to state which ordering is used when referring to the encoding. This article will use a scheme that has some popularity, which is to add the suffix &quot;8888&quot; to indicate if 4 8-bit units or &quot;32&quot; if one 32-bit unit are being discussed.

=== RGBA8888 ===

In OpenGL and Portable Network Graphics (PNG), the RGBA byte order is used, where the colors are stored in memory such that R is at the lowest address, G after it, B after that, and A last. On a little endian architecture this is equivalent to ABGR32.

In many systems when there are more than 8 bits per channel (such as 16 bits or floating-point), the channels are stored in RGBA order, even if 8-bit channels are stored in some other order.

=== ARGB32 ===

The channels are arranged in memory in such manner that a single 32-bit unsigned integer has the alpha sample in the highest 8 bits, followed by the red sample, green sample and finally the blue sample in the lowest 8 bits:

ARGB values are typically expressed using 8 hexadecimal digits, with each pair of the hexadecimal digits representing the values of the Alpha, Red, Green and Blue channel, respectively. For example, codice_1 represents 50.2% opaque (non-premultiplied) yellow. The codice_2 hex value, which is 128 in decimal, represents a 50.2% alpha value because 128 is approximately 50.2% of the maximum value of 255 (FF hex); to continue to decipher the codice_1 value, the first codice_4 represents the maximum value red can have; the second codice_4 is like the previous but for green; the final codice_6 represents the minimum value blue can have (effectively – no blue). Consequently, red + green yields yellow. In cases where the alpha is not used this can be shortened to 6 digits codice_7, this is why it was chosen to put the alpha in the top bits. Depending on the context a codice_8 or a number sign (#) is put before the hex digits.

This layout became popular when 24-bit color (and 32-bit RGBA) was introduced on personal computers. At the time it was much faster and easier for programs to manipulate one 32-bit unit than four 8-bit units.

On little-endian systems, this is equivalent to BGRA byte order. On big-endian systems, this is equivalent to ARGB byte order.

=== RGBA32 ===

In some software originating on big-endian machines such as Silicon Graphics, colors were stored in 32 bits similar to ARGB32, but with the alpha in the &quot;bottom&quot; 8 bits rather than the top. For example, codice_9 would be Red and Green:50.2%, Blue:0% and Alpha:100%, a brown. This is what you would get if RGBA8888 data was read as words on these machines. It is used in Portable Arbitrary Map and in FLTK, but in general it is rare.

The bytes are stored in memory on a little-endian machine in the order ABGR.

<doc id="252830" wikidata="Q2816938" url="?curid=252830" title="IBM Informix-4GL">
<text>Informix-4GL is a 4GL programming language developed by Informix during the mid-1980s. At the time of its initial release in 1986, supported platforms included Microsoft Xenix (on IBM PC AT), DEC Ultrix (running on Microvax II, VAX-11/750, VAX-11/785, VAX 8600), Altos 2086, AT&amp;T 3B2, AT&amp;T 3B5, AT&amp;T 3B20 and AT&amp;T Unix PC.

==Description==
It includes embedded SQL, a report writer language, a form language, and a limited set of imperative capabilities (functions, if and while statements, and supports arrays etc.). The language is particularly close to a natural language and is easy to learn and use. The Form Painter, Screen Code Generator, Report Code Generator (Featurizer) enabled adding custom business logic. It also had, as additional components a menu system, and a front-end GUI (graphical user interface) Generator.

The package includes two versions of compiler which either produce 1) intermediate byte code for an interpreter (known as the rapid development system), or 2) C Programming Language code for compilation with a C compiler into machine-code (which executes faster, but compiles slower, and executables are bigger). It is specifically designed to run as a client on a network, connected to an IBM Informix database engine service. It has a mechanism for calling C Programming Language functions and conversely, to be called from executing C programs. The RDS version also features an interactive debugger for Dumb terminals. A particular feature is the comprehensive error checking which is built into the final executable and the extremely helpful error messages produced by both compilers and executables. It also features embedded modal statements for changing compiler and executable behaviour (e.g. causing the compiler to include memory structures matching database schema structures and elements, or to continue executing in spite of error conditions, which can be trapped later on).

==History==
The Informix-4GL project was started in 1985, with Chris Maloney as chief architect. Roy Harrington was in charge of the related Informix Turbo (later renamed Online) engine, which bypassed the &quot;cooked&quot; file system and instead used &quot;raw&quot; disk access. It was based on software developed in 1983 by FourGen Software Technologies, which were based in Seattle. The bundled product was presented by Informix as ‘’’Forms’’’ and ‘’’Menu’’’ until 1996. This ‘’’Rapid Application Development’’’ product, marketed as FourGen CASE Tools, could access the user’s choice of ‘’’Informix’’’ and/or IBM’s DB2 databases. Another flavor of Informix programming-tool was produced, called &quot;NewEra&quot;, which supported object-oriented programming and a level of code-compatibility with Informix-4GL.

Informix was acquired by IBM in April 2001. Despite its age, Informix-4GL is still widely used to develop business applications, and a sizable market exists around it due to its popularity. With accounting being an inherently text based activity, it is often chosen for its purely text-based interface to optimize data entry efficiency. These tools are available today on major flavors of UNIX and Red Hat Linux and SUSE Linux operating systems; the FOURGEN business was later acquired in 2002, by www.gillan.com.

<text>Marble Hill is the northernmost neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Although once part of Manhattan Island, a large modern shipping canal was dug to its south over a small earlier canal in the late 19th century. The neighborhood was then connected to the mainland United States in the early 20th century. The Bronx surrounds the neighborhood to the west, north, and east, while the Harlem River is its southern border.

The area of Marble Hill became a Dutch colonial settlement in 1646. It served as a crossing point to the mainland when the colonial British had the King&#x27;s Bridge constructed in 1693 to span the Spuyten Duyvil Creek. It gained its current name in 1891 from the Tuckahoe marble deposits discovered underneath the neighborhood.

Marble Hill was once the northernmost tip of the island of Manhattan. The Spuyten Duyvil Creek flowed around the neighborhood to the north, separating Marble Hill from the Bronx, and by extension, the North American mainland. Marble Hill became an island in 1817, when two small streams were dug up to form a narrow canal. The waterway ran from the Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the Harlem River.

The mill canal was expanded in 1895 to become the Harlem River Ship Canal. The new channel, constructed at the direction of the federal government, was wide and at least deep at its completion. Marble Hill remained an island until it was physically connected to the Bronx in 1913, when the old northern bend of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in.

The boundaries of the neighborhood are approximately between Terrace View Avenue and Johnson Avenue to the west, between 228th Street and 230th Street to the north, and cutting through the Marble Hill Houses and River Plaza Shopping Center to the east. It is connected to the rest of Manhattan by the Broadway Bridge.

Because of this change in topography, Marble Hill is often associated with the Bronx and is part of Bronx Community District 8. In addition, Marble Hill has a Bronx ZIP Code of 10463, and is served by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 50th Precinct, headquartered in the Bronx. Unlike the rest of Manhattan, it carries the Bronx area codes 718, 347, and 929, which are overlaid by the citywide area code 917.

==History==
===Colonial era===
Marble Hill has been occupied since the Dutch colonial period. On August 18, 1646, Governor Willem Kieft, the Dutch Director of New Netherland, signed a land grant to Mattius Jansen van Keulan and Huyck Aertsen which included the whole of the present community. Johannes Verveelen petitioned the Harlem authorities to move his ferry from what is now the East River and 125th Street to Spuyten Duyvil Creek because the creek was shallow enough to wade across, thus providing a means of evading the toll. The ferry charter was granted in 1667. Many settlers circumvented the toll for the ferry by crossing the creek from northern Marble Hill to modern Kingsbridge, Bronx, a point where it was feasible to wade or swim through the waters. In 1669 Verveelen transplanted his ferry to the northern tip of Marble Hill, at today&#x27;s Broadway and West 231st Street.

====Bridges====
Two bridges connected Marble Hill with the mainland: the King&#x27;s Bridge and the Dyckman Free Bridge. In 1693 Frederick Philipse, a Frisian-born merchant who had sworn allegiance to the Crown upon the British takeover of Dutch New Netherlands in 1664, built the King&#x27;s Bridge at Marble Hill near what is now West 230th Street in the Bronx. A prominent trader in New Amsterdam, Philipse had purchased vast landholdings in what was then Westchester County during the 1670s and 1680s. Granted the title Lord of Philipse Manor, he established a plantation and provisioning depot for his shipping business upriver on the Hudson in present-day Sleepy Hollow. His toll bridge provided access and opened his land to settlement. Later, it carried the Boston Post Road.In 1758, the Free Bridge was erected by Jacob Dyckman and Benjamin Palmer. It opened on January 1, 1759. Its purpose was to serve the farmers who refused to pay the toll. Stagecoach service was later established across the span. The new bridge proceeded to take much of the traffic away from the King&#x27;s Bridge.

One of the local visiting spots during this period was a tavern operated by the Dyckman family, which also owned the Dyckman House. The tavern was situated to cater to the traffic from both bridges. In 1772 the Dyckmans sold the tavern to Caleb Hyatt, known afterwards as Hyatt&#x27;s Tavern at the Free Bridge. The Dyckmans used the proceeds to finance a new operation on the west side of Broadway and 226th Street that was to be managed by Benjamin Palmer, who owned property on City Island.

===American Revolution===

When hostilities broke out at the start of the American Revolution, the Continental Army constructed a fort on Marble Hill as part of a series of forts to defend the area. By November 1776, the fort had been taken over by Hessian forces and renamed Fort Prince Charles in honor of Charles, Duke of Brunswick, brother-in-law to George III. Despite contrary beliefs, the King&#x27;s Bridge and the Dyckman Free Bridge served as escape routes for the retreating American forces after the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. The latter of these bridges was destroyed during the war. In January 1777, an American attack was made in the Marble Hill area against the Hessian occupiers. This particular raid was under the command of General William Heath, which, when the cannons opened up, forced the Hessians to retreat from the tavern to the fort to return fire.

Hyatt&#x27;s Tavern remained in the Hyatt family until 1807, when it was leased to James Devoe. The building was eventually razed, succeeded by the Kingsbridge Hotel on the east side of Broadway at 226th Street. The hotel had a mansard roof and a central turret. It catered to the anglers and sportsman who came to the area either by the Hudson River Railroad Company or boat service up the Harlem River. One of the meals served at the hotel was turtle dinner, which became a favorite of the guests. The hotel&#x27;s business declined when Broadway was widened and interest was lost in the community. The hotel eventually fell into disrepair and was torn down in 1917.

Philipse Manor was forfeited to the state legislature after the war. Afterward, the King&#x27;s Bridge was free. In 1817, Curtis and John Bolton purchased land in the area, laying a road called Bolton Road. Their home was on the south side of the community and included a marble mill.

The name of Marble Hill was conceived when Darius C. Crosby came up with the name in 1891 from the deposits of dolomite marble underlying it, a relatively soft rock that crops out in Inwood and Marble Hill, known as Inwood marble. The marble was quarried for the federal buildings in lower Manhattan when New York was the capital of the United States in the 1780s.

Saint Stephen&#x27;s United Methodist Church, a community fixture since its 1898 construction, is located at 228th Street and Marble Hill Avenue. It is the third structure of the same name, as well as one of the oldest remaining buildings in Marble Hill. The congregation was founded on Mosholu Parkway in 1826 and was incorporated a decade later, making it one of the earliest religious institutions in the area. It moved to another structure in Riverdale in 1876. The church building was restored in the 1950s, and again in 2010. One of its corners, the one closest to the intersection, has a tall bell tower. There are circular stained glass windows facing both streets. Inside is an Akron Plan-inspired setup with balconies and an auditorium that is laid out like an amphitheater. One of the pastors of St. Stephen&#x27;s was Reverend William Tieck, who served the church from 1946 to 1977. Tieck was the official Bronx County historian from 1989 to 1996, authoring several books about the Bronx.

===Separation from Manhattan Island===

Marble Hill once unmistakably belonged to Manhattan, forming the island&#x27;s northernmost tip. The Spuyten Duyvil Creek flowed to the neighborhood&#x27;s north, connecting the Hudson and Harlem Rivers. The creek separated Marble Hill from the Bronx, and by extension, the North American mainland. Marble Hill became an island in its own right in 1817, when two small streams were dug up to form a 30-foot-wide canal. This waterway ran 1500 feet east–west from the Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the Harlem River at approximately 222nd Street, cutting off Marble Hill from Manhattan Island. Known at different times as Dyckman&#x27;s Canal, Boltons’ Canal, or Nichols’ Canal, the waterway once powered Curtis and John Bolton&#x27;s marble mill, which sat alongside it.

After an increase in ship traffic in the 1890s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers determined that a wide canal was needed for a shipping route between the Hudson and Harlem rivers. Such a canal had been proposed since the early 19th century.

Construction of such a waterway, the Harlem River Ship Channel, finally started in January 1888. The canal was to be in width and had a depth of to . It would be cut directly through the rock of Dyckman&#x27;s Meadow, making a straight course to the Hudson River.

The first section of the canal, the cut at Marble Hill, was completed in 1895 and opened on June 17 of that year. Several festivities including parades were held to commemorate the occasion. This rendered Marble Hill an island bounded by the canal to the south and the original course of the Harlem River to the north. The Greater New York Charter of 1897 designated Marble Hill as part of the Borough of Manhattan. A bridge opened over the former Marble Hill alignment of the creek in 1900, carrying Broadway. The bridge&#x27;s superstructure was demolished shortly afterward, with the construction of the IRT subway above Broadway in 1904.

Marble Hill remained an island for years until it was physically connected to the Bronx in 1913, when the old Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in with rocks that were removed to build Grand Central Terminal in central Manhattan. Both the King&#x27;s and Dyckman Free Bridges were covered over with landfill. The bridge carrying Broadway over the former alignment of the creek at 230th Street was destroyed in the late 1920s. At 210 West 230th Street, at the southwest corner with Broadway, is a plaque designating the area as the site of the King&#x27;s Bridge. The site of the Dyckman Free Bridge is located on the grounds of today&#x27;s Marble Hill Houses.

On January 1, 1914, following passage of an act of the New York State Legislature, Bronx County was created, but Marble Hill remained part of New York County.

==Character==
=== Housing ===
Six-story apartment houses were constructed in the 20th century, and in the early 1950s urban renewal came to the area. A complex was built bounded by Broadway, Exterior Street and 225th Street and was called the Marble Hill Houses. This property was acquired by New York City on August 26, 1948. The houses were completed in 1952. Part of the acquisition became the Marble Hill Playground, which is located on Marble Hill Avenue between 228th and 230th Streets. Despite the name, only seven of the 11 towers are actually in Marble Hill; the other four are in Kingsbridge.

Out of Marble Hill&#x27;s 4,000 households, only 135 lived in private houses , down from 138 such households in 1989. The majority of Marble Hill&#x27;s 9,481 residents (as of the 2010 United States Census) live in the Marble Hill Houses. There are also Art Deco apartment buildings lining some streets. These buildings even boast one pedestrian alley, Marble Hill Lane, in a manner similar to in Inwood and surrounding Bronx neighborhoods.

Private residences in Marble Hill include detached single- and two-story houses. It is not uncommon to see a detached house next to a multilevel apartment building in Marble Hill. The neighborhood is described as cozy, with neighbors watching out for one another, and a sense of &quot;community spirit.&quot; The blocks of Marble Hill with these single-story houses were described as a &quot;well-kept secret&quot;: relatively cheap, with ample space and a backyard. In 1995 one reporter wrote of these houses, &quot;Where else in Manhattan can you find a six-bedroom, three-story house on a quiet, tree-lined street with an attic, a basement, an enclosed front porch and a pretty facade for sale for $174,000? Or a three-family house with six bedrooms on an architecturally magnificent street with an asking price of $295,000?&quot;

=== Street naming ===
Many of the neighborhood&#x27;s streets were named for Dutch settlers to Marble Hill. For instance, Teunissen Place, a dead-end alley off Terrace View Avenue to the neighborhood&#x27;s west, is named after Tobias Teunissen, a wool washer from Leyden, Holland, who came to the area in 1636. He applied for and received a land grant to live in Inwood near 213th Street. Occasionally he had worked on the De La Montagne farm, which was in what is now the Harlem section of Manhattan. Teunissen was killed in an Indian raid in 1655, and his wife and child were held hostage until they were ransomed by the Dutch authorities. The Dyckmans and the Nagles, who owned land in Inwood, purchased the Teunissen property in 1677.

Adrian Avenue is named after Adriaen van der Donck, an early lawyer in New Amsterdam. With permission, he bought a strip of land from local Native American tribes in 1646. This land stretched from Spuyten Duyvil to present-day Yonkers along the Hudson coastline.

Van Corlear Place, which comprises half of a U-shaped street curving around Marble Hill, has detached one- and two-family homes in addition to a few brick townhouses. It was named after Anthony Van Corlaer, a messenger of New Amsterdam Governor-General Peter Stuyvesant who was sent to the mainland Bronx for backup soldiers following reports of attempts by British forces to seize New Amsterdam. In Washington Irving&#x27;s book &quot;A History of New York&quot;, van Corlaer is said to have drowned while crossing Spuyten Duyvil Creek. The street&#x27;s name is misspelled.

Jacobus Place, the other half of the U-shape that includes Van Corlear Place, has both a large brick apartment building and freestanding private houses with diverse designs. It is named after Jacob (Jacobus) Dyckman, the owner of the Dyckman Tavern and a sponsor of the Dyckman Free Bridge.

Fort Charles Place remains as a token of the Hessian-named &quot;Fort Prince Charles&quot;.

==Shopping mall==

River Plaza, a shopping mall located on 40 West 225th Street between Broadway and Exterior Street and overlooking the Harlem River, opened in August 2004. It is the commercial center for Marble Hill. It cost $90 million and has a floor area of . The mall, which has an open-air format in which the passageways between stores are outdoors, has a 640-space parking lot on the roof. In 2002, before construction, developers purchased adjacent land from six owners, with the largest building on these lots being a deteriorating, -floor, warehouse owned by NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. Since the building could not be renovated cheaply enough, it was demolished. The mall was built on a foundation of soft soil and a shallow water table, so builders had to place 1,500 concrete-capped steel piles into the soil. The finished building was designed to retain views of landmarks like the George Washington Bridge and the Empire State Building.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Marble Hill as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area encompassing Inwood and Marble Hill. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Inwood and Marble Hill was 46,746, a change of -2,341 (-5%) from the 49,087 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 15.1% (7,060) White, 9.1% (4,239) African American, 0.1% (64) Native American, 1.9% (884) Asian, 0% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (179) from other races, and 1% (458) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 72.4% (33,857) of the population.

The racial composition of Marble Hill and Inwood changed moderately from 2000 to 2010, with the most significant changes being the Black population&#x27;s decrease by 13% (661) and the Hispanic / Latino population&#x27;s decrease by 5% (1,880). Meanwhile, the White population grew by 5% (335) and remained a minority, as with the Asian population which grew by 11% (86); the small population of all other races decreased by 24% (221).

The entirety of Bronx Community District 8, which comprises Marble Hill as well as Kingsbridge, Riverdale, Spuyten Duyvil, Fieldston, and Van Cortlandt Village, had 102,927 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 80.9 years. This is about the slightly lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are children and middle-aged adults: 28% are between the ages of 25–44, while 25% are between 45 and 64, and 20% are between 0–17. The proportion of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 18% respectively.

As of 2019, the median household income in Bronx Community District 8 was $47,000 compared to $53,000 in the entire city. In 2019, an estimated 15% of residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 52% in Community District 8, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, as of 2018, Community District 8 is not considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was not low-income in 1990.

==Police and crime==
Marble Hill is patrolled by the 50th Precinct of the NYPD in the Bronx, located at 3450 Kingsbridge Avenue. The 50th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 69.9% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported three murders, 22 rapes, 185 robberies, 213 felony assaults, 126 burglaries, 695 grand larcenies, and 288 grand larcenies auto in 2022.

, Bronx Community District 8 has a non-fatal assault hospitalization rate of 40 per 100,000 people, compared to the Bronx&#x27;s rate of 113 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 59 per 100,000. Its incarceration rate is 225 per 100,000 people, compared to the Bronx&#x27;s rate of 670 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 425 per 100,000.

Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 50th Precinct had a rate of 363 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the Bronx&#x27;s average of 851 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000.

In 2019, the highest concentration of felony assaults in Marble Hill was on Broadway between 225th Street and 228th Street, where there were 13 felony assaults. The highest concentration of robberies was nearby, at the intersection of Broadway and 225th Street, where there were 8 robberies.

==Fire safety==
Marble Hill is served by a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire station, Engine Co. 81/Ladder Co. 46, at 3025 Bailey Avenue.

The Marble Hill Hose Company was organized in 1895 because, at the time, there was no fire station in the neighborhood. FDNY horses were unable to climb the neighborhood&#x27;s steep hills, so the FDNY loaned the company a hose cart; a fire engine was not required because the water pressure in the hydrants were sufficient to propel a stream of water. It was the only independent fire company in Manhattan after the FDNY became a paid fire department in 1865. The Marble Hill Hose Company remained in service for ten years.

==Education==
===Schools===

John F. Kennedy High School was built in the former riverbed on the western side of Marble Hill, and was opened in September 1972. Beginning in fall 2002, smaller high schools were established within the campus. Due to poor academic performance in the 2000s, as well as a series of violent crimes at the school (including the murder of a student), the New York City Department of Education made a decision in fall 2010 to close the school, phasing out one grade per year until 2014. It closed down in 2014, and six smaller, specialty high schools now occupy its campus: four public, two charter. Four of these schools were founded in 2002, while the other two were established in 2011 after the decision was made to close John F. Kennedy High School. The nearest public elementary school is PS 7 Milton Fein School in Kingsbridge, serving grades K–5.

Nearby private schools include Horace Mann School, Riverdale Country School, and Ethical Culture Fieldston School. The nearest parochial school is now Good Shepherd, in Inwood. The parochial school formerly serving the neighborhood, St. John&#x27;s, in Kingsbridge was closed in 2020. The Marble Hill Nursery School, in the Marble Hill Houses, is privately operated with some funding with the city.

===Library===
The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Kingsbridge branch at 291 West 231st Street, which replaced a building from 1959 located across West 231st Street.

==Transportation==

In 1905–1906, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad built the Marble Hill station as a replacement for the former Kingsbridge Station used by an affiliate known as the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad. The station was relocated from the east side of Broadway to the west side in the late-1970s and is now served by the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, which provides commuter railroad service to Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan, locations in the Bronx, and points north. The station is at the bottom of a substantial cliff. For the purpose of purchasing Combo Tickets, Metro-North considers Marble Hill to be in the Bronx.

The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) extended their Broadway–Seventh Avenue line, now part of the New York City Subway, from 145th Street to 242nd Street in 1906. As part of the construction, the IRT built a station at 225th Street. That station is currently served by the .

The main street through Marble Hill is Broadway, part of U.S. Route 9.

==Politics==
The United States Census Bureau defines Marble Hill as Census Tract 309 of New York County. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 8,463 on a land area of . Because Marble Hill is legally part of Manhattan, residents who serve on jury duty go to the courthouses at Foley Square in lower Manhattan.

===Political representation===
Politically, Marble Hill is in New York&#x27;s 13th congressional district. It is in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 31st district, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 72nd district, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 10th district. Bronx Community Board 8 is the local community board for Marble Hill.

===History of political dispute===
On March 11, 1939, as a publicity stunt, Bronx Borough President James J. Lyons planted the Bronx County flag on the rocky promontory at 225th Street and Jacobus Place. Lyons proclaimed Marble Hill as a part of the Bronx and demanded the subservience of its residents to that borough, saying it was &quot;The Bronx Sudetenland,&quot; referring to Hitler&#x27;s 1938 annexation of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia. The incident was met with boos and nose-thumbing by 50 residents of Marble Hill, who referred to the effort as similar to an &quot;Anschluss&quot;. Since then, more lighthearted &quot;annexations&quot; have occurred.

Residents of the neighborhood wished to remain residents of Manhattan, and petitions and signatures were gathered to be sent to Governor Herbert H. Lehman to ensure that Marble Hill remain part of Manhattan. In 1984, in response to one Marble Hill resident&#x27;s refusal to serve on jury duty for a murder case in Manhattan that year due to the resident claiming that she was not a resident of New York County and Manhattan, New York Supreme Court justice Peter J. McQuillan ruled that Marble Hill was simultaneously part of the Borough of Manhattan (not the Borough of the Bronx) and part of Bronx County (not New York County) and the matter was definitively settled later that year when the New York Legislature overwhelmingly passed legislation declaring the neighborhood part of both New York County and the Borough of Manhattan and made this clarification retroactive to 1938, as reflected on the official maps of the city.

The confusion has been so great that when New York City Councilman Guillermo Linares was elected as Marble Hill&#x27;s representative in 1991, he originally thought the neighborhood was part of the Bronx.

===Services===
Marble Hill residents remain part of a political district that includes the northernmost areas of Manhattan (Washington Heights and Inwood), but city services – for example, the fire and police departments – come from and are in the Bronx for reasons of convenience and safety, since the only road connection to the rest of Manhattan is a lift bridge, the Broadway Bridge. However, medical services are provided from Manhattan Island, and medical vehicles come from Columbia University&#x27;s Allen Pavilion, also known as the Allen Hospital, a satellite facility of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.

Marble Hill, along with Spuyten Duyvil and Kingsbridge in the Bronx, is located within ZIP Code 10463. The &quot;104&quot; prefix is used for Bronx localities, while &quot;100&quot; through &quot;102&quot; are reserved for Manhattan addresses – although mail can be addressed to either &quot;New York, New York&quot; using the USPS designator for Manhattan, or to &quot;Bronx, New York&quot; as long as the ZIP Code is accurate. The United States Postal Service operates the Kingsbridge Station post office at 5517 Broadway.

In 1984, area code 718 was created out of area code 212 for the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island; the Bronx and Marble Hill were added to the 718 area code in 1992. Marble Hill residents unsuccessfully fought to retain the 212 area code, which was considered more prestigious than the 718 area code. Since then, Marble Hill has been in area code 718 (now also served by three overlay codes: 347 and 929 for the outer boroughs, and 917 for the entire city), but residents are listed in both Bronx and Manhattan telephone books.

==Notable people==
Notable current and former residents of Marble Hill include:
* Ted Corbitt (1919–2007), pioneering long-distance runner
* Guillermo Linares (born 1951), politician who represented the 72nd Assembly District in the New York State Assembly
* Justin Pierce (1975–2000), actor and skateboarder

<doc id="252839" wikidata="Q811633" url="?curid=252839" title="New World porcupine">
<text>The New World porcupines, family Erethizontidae, are large arboreal rodents, distinguished by their spiny coverings from which they take their name. They inhabit forests and wooded regions across North America, and into northern South America. Although both the New World and Old World porcupine families belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are quite different and are not closely related.

== Characteristics ==
New World porcupines are stout animals, with blunt, rounded heads, fleshy, mobile snouts, and coats of thick, cylindrical or flattened spines. The &quot;quills&quot; are mixed with long, soft hairs. They vary in size from the relatively small prehensile-tailed porcupines, which are around long, and weigh about , to the much larger North American porcupine, which has a body length of , and weighs up to .

They are distinguished from the Old World porcupines in that they have rooted molars, complete collar bones, entire upper lips, tuberculated soles, no trace of first front toes, and four teats.

They are less strictly nocturnal than Old World species in their habits, and some types live entirely in trees, while others have dens on the ground. Their long and powerful prehensile tails help them balance when they are in the tree tops. Their diets consist mainly of bark, leaves, and conifer needles, but can also include roots, stems, berries, fruits, seeds, nuts, grasses, and flowers. Some species also eat insects and small reptiles. Their teeth are similar to those of Old World porcupines, with the dental formula .

Solitary offspring (or, rarely, twins) are born after a gestation period of up to 210 days, depending on the species. The young are born fully developed, with open eyes, and are able to climb trees within a few days of birth.

== Genera and species ==
They include three genera, of which the first is represented by the North American porcupine (&quot;Erethizon dorsatum&quot;), a stout, heavily built animal, with long hairs almost or quite hiding its spines, four front and five hind toes, and a short, stumpy tail. It is a native of the greater part of Canada and the United States, where any remnant of the original forest is left.

The tree porcupines (&quot;Coendou&quot;) contain 17 species. They are found throughout tropical South America, with two extending into Mexico. They are of a lighter build than the ground porcupines, with short, close, many-coloured spines, often mixed with hairs, and prehensile tails. The hind feet have only four toes, owing to the suppression of the first, in place of which they have a fleshy pad on the inner side of the foot; between this pad and the toes, branches and other objects can be firmly grasped as with a hand. These three genera are often united into a single genus &quot;Coendou&quot;.

Genus &quot;Chaetomys&quot;, distinguished by the shape of its skull and the greater complexity of its teeth, contains the bristle-spined rat (&quot;C. subspinosus&quot;), a native of the hottest parts of Brazil. This animal is often considered a member of Echimyidae on the basis of its premolars. However, a molecular phylogeny based on the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome b combined to karyological evidence actually suggests the bristle-spined rat is more closely related to the Erethizontidae than to the Echimyidae, and is the sister group of all other Erethizontidae.

<doc id="252844" wikidata="Q4818346" url="?curid=252844" title="Bonnie Burnard">
<text>Bonnie Burnard (January 15, 1945 – March 4, 2017) was a Canadian short story writer and novelist, best known for her 1999 novel, &quot;A Good House&quot;, which won the Scotiabank Giller Prize.

Born in Petrolia, Ontario, she grew up in Forest, Ontario, and moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, in the late 1970s. In the early 1990s she returned to Southwestern Ontario, and was a resident of London, Ontario, where she died on March 4, 2017.

==Personal life==
Born Bonita Amelia Huctwith on January 15, 1945, in Petrolia, Ontario, she grew up with her four brothers in Forest, Ontario. She was the youngest in her family. Her mother&#x27;s family bred Clydesdale horses which they showcased at the annual Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in Toronto. Her father, Charles, was raised by his relatives after his parents died when he was a child. The couple sold eggs at the Toronto market and later shipped tens of thousands of cases from Ottawa to England. After World War II, the couple continued to sell eggs to Toronto and Montreal. In 1967, Burnard completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Western Ontario.

Burnard married Ronald Burnard, an executive at London Life Insurance in 1973 and spent more than a decade in Regina, Saskatchewan, where she raised her three children; Alexandra (known as D&#x27;Arcy) (b. Sept. 1975), Melanie (b. Feb. 1978), and David (b. Mar. 1979). She worked as a literary officer at the Saskatchewan Arts Board from 1988 to 1990. She moved back to Southwestern Ontario in 1992, living briefly in Strathroy-Caradoc and later moving to London, Ontario; her marriage had ended a few years earlier. She served as a Writer in Residence at the University of Western Ontario and was a guest lecturer at writing and literary conferences across Canada and around the world (e.g., England, Germany, Sweden, and South Africa).

She taught at the Humber School for Writers, the University of British Columbia&#x27;s summer creative writing program Booming Ground, and at the University of Windsor as an adjunct professor in the writing department. Burnard worked briefly for a lawyer, the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada, served on the Public Lending Right Commission, as a board member at Coteau Books and the Saskatchewan Writers Guild.

Burnard died on March 4, 2017, at the age of 72. She is survived by three children and four grandchildren.

==Literary work==
While attending classes at the University of Regina, Burnard attended one of the reading sessions by another Canadian novelist, Marian Engel, which inspired her to write. Engel had visited Regina to read from her the Governor-General&#x27;s Literary Award-winning novel, &quot;Bear&quot;. Canadian poet and novelist Ken Mitchell suggested she attend the Saskatchewan Summer School of the Arts. Her first published work was a short story published simultaneously in &quot;Saskatchewan Gold&quot; and the &quot;NeWest Review&quot;. In 1983, Oberon Press published her short stories in &quot;Coming Attractions. Stories By Sharon Butala, Bonnie Burnard &amp; Sharon Sparling&quot;. She edited the 1986 book &quot;The Old Dance: Love Stories of One Kind or Another&quot; published by Thunder Creek Publishing Co-operative. In 1988, her first individually authored short story collection &quot;Women of Influence&quot; was published. The collection was later translated into French as &quot;Femmes d&#x27;Influence&quot; by S. Brault in 1995.

<doc id="252846" wikidata="Q1756029" url="?curid=252846" title="Operation Tonga">
<text>Operation Tonga was the codename given to the airborne operation undertaken by the British 6th Airborne Division between 5 June and 7 June 1944 as a part of Operation Overlord and the D-Day landings during the Second World War.

The paratroopers and glider-borne airborne troops of the division, commanded by Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area, near to the city of Caen, tasked with a number of objectives. The division was to capture two strategically important bridges over the Caen Canal and Orne River which were to be used by Allied ground forces to advance once the seaborne landings had taken place, destroy several other bridges to deny their use to the Germans and secure several important villages. The division was also assigned the task of assaulting and destroying the Merville Gun Battery, an artillery battery that Allied intelligence believed housed a number of heavy artillery pieces, which could bombard the nearest invasion beach (codenamed Sword) and possibly inflict heavy casualties on the Allied troops landing on it. Having achieved these objectives, the division was then to create and secure a bridgehead focused around the captured bridges until they linked up with advancing Allied ground forces.

The division suffered from a combination of bad weather and poor pilot navigation, which caused many of the airborne troops to be dropped inaccurately throughout the divisional operational area causing a number of casualties and making conducting operations much more difficult. In particular, the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was assigned the task of destroying the Merville artillery battery, was only able to gather up a fraction of its strength before it had to attack the battery, with the result that the depleted force suffered heavy casualties. However, the battery was successfully assaulted and the guns inside it disabled. The division&#x27;s other objectives were also achieved despite the problems encountered.

A small force of glider-borne troops, from the 2nd Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, secured two bridges over the Caen Canal and River Orne in a coup de main operation. The other bridges were destroyed by the division, and a number of villages were occupied. A bridgehead was formed by the division, and it successfully repulsed a number of German counter-attacks until Allied ground forces from the invasion beaches reached its positions. The actions of the division severely limited the ability of the German defenders to communicate and organise themselves, ensuring that the seaborne troops could not be attacked during the vital first few hours after landing when they were most vulnerable.

== Background ==
Operation Tonga originated in the planning of Operation Overlord, the Allied plan for the eventual invasion and liberation of German-occupied France. Invasion planning begun in May 1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met during the Washington Conference. The two Allied leaders decided that all available Allied forces should be concentrated in the United Kingdom, and that planning for the invasion of North-Western Europe should begin. A provisional target date of May 1944 was set with the code-name &#x27;Overlord&#x27; decided upon. A joint Anglo-American planning staff was created under lieutenant-general Frederick E. Morgan, who was given the title of Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC).

Early drafts of Overlord called for the commitment of airborne forces to support the ground forces and protect their landing areas. Operation Skyscraper, for example, called for the deployment of two airborne divisions to support the beach landings that would be made by five infantry divisions. One airborne division would land near Caen, and another on the east coast of the Cotentin Peninsula. &quot;Plan C&quot;, an ambitious proposal put forward by General George C. Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, would have involved a large airborne drop on the River Seine, aiming to cut the German forces in half during D-Day itself. Morgan and his staff finally decided that the invasion should take place along a thirty-mile front from the River Orne westwards. The final plan would utilise three divisions in the first assault, with airborne forces being dropped onto the town of Caen early on the first day to seize the first breakout route.

Following the appointment of General Sir Bernard Montgomery to the command of the 21st Army Group and overall command of all ground forces to land in Normandy, the plan underwent a number of further revisions. On 21 January 1944, a revised Overlord plan was presented to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had been chosen as the Supreme Allied Commander for the invasion. Montgomery&#x27;s revised plan widened the landing area to include all of the coastline between the River Orne and the eastern coast of the Cotentin Peninsula; five divisions would land on the beaches, and supported by three airborne divisions to land on either side of the landing areas to secure their flanks and protect the landing troops from counterattack. The British airborne forces were assigned to the eastern flank, and the American airborne forces the west.

== Prelude ==

=== British preparation ===
The 6th Airborne Division, which was under the command of Major-General Richard Gale, was chosen to conduct the airborne operations on the eastern flank of the invasion area. The division was new, having been activated in April 1943, and Operation Overlord would be its first experience of combat. The division was the first to be established for the sole purpose of undertaking division-level airborne operations rather than contributing to a range of smaller operations, and there was considerable debate over what the unit should do.
As late as January 1944, Gale noted that he had &quot;no indication as yet of a definite airborne task&quot; for his unit and continued to keep all options open, reflecting the ongoing discussions at the strategic level over the wider plan for D-Day. On 17 February 1944, Major-General Frederick Arthur Montague Browning (commander of all British airborne forces) arrived at the 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s headquarters to brief Gale on what the division was expected to achieve during the invasion; their role codenamed Operation Tonga.

The original plan for Tonga did not involve the entire division, instead only called for a single parachute brigade and an anti-tank battery to be attached to the British 3rd Infantry Division. This force would be tasked with seizing bridges over the Caen Canal and the River Orne near the towns of Bénouville and Ranville. Gale objected to this small-scale operation, arguing that a single brigade would not be able to achieve these objectives with such limited manpower, and asked for the entire division to be deployed. After consultation with his superiors, Browning agreed to the request and ordered Gale to begin planning for the operation.

The division was allotted three specific tasks to achieve as a part of Tonga, apart from protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings and taking control of the areas of strategic importance to the east of Caen. First, it was to capture intact the two bridges over the Caen Canal and the Orne River at Bénouville and Ranville. The bridges then would be defended against counterattacks. Gale knew that the capture of the bridges would be critical for the resupply and reinforcement of his division, but he did not know that the bridges were incapable of supporting tanks. Second, the division was to destroy the heavily fortified Merville coastal artillery battery located at Franceville Plage, to ensure that it could not shell the British forces landing in the area codenamed Sword. The third mission was to destroy several bridges which spanned the River Dives, located near the towns of Varaville, Robehomme, Bures and Troarn. The division would then hold the territory that it had seized, until it could be relieved by advancing British ground forces.
Detailed planning for Tonga began in February, starting with the number of transport aircraft assigned to the operation being expanded rapidly to accommodate the entire division. Two Royal Air Force (RAF) air groups were provided for the operation to ensure that the division could be deployed in just two airlifts. The pilots and crew of these transport aircraft then began formation flying training and specialised aircrew training to ensure that they were as familiar with what the operation required of them. The 6th Airborne Division carried out several large-scale airborne exercises, using them to find the most efficient way to deploy a brigade group on one or multiple landing-zones.

On 6 February, the 3rd Parachute Brigade undertook an exercise in which the entire brigade was dropped by 98 transport aircraft. At the end of March, 284 aircraft were used in Exercise &#x27;Bizz II&#x27; in which the entire division was deployed by parachute or glider. Between 21 April and 26 April, Exercise &#x27;Mush&#x27; utilised approximately 700 aircraft to deploy the British 1st Airborne Division and the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade against the 6th Airborne Division, who moved by road, in a simulation of a full-scale airborne operation.

As the date of the operation approached, training became more intensive. Glider units spent hours aloft every day circling over airfields as they practiced the manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to the bridges over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots had practiced this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles.

The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture the bridges over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective.

The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of scale models of the zones and the primary objectives, such as the bridges and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the correct speed and height over the scale models, realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.

=== German preparation ===

The 6th Airborne Division would be opposed by German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) formations stationed in the area around Caen and the River Orne. By June 1944, this consisted of the 711th and 716th Infantry Divisions; both of which were static formations whose manpower consisted of medically downgraded troops and conscripts recruited from the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Both divisions also had a miscellaneous collection of anti-tank guns and artillery pieces, as well as a small number of German and French tanks and self-propelled guns.

Neither division was rated as being highly efficient, with Allied intelligence rating them at a forty per-cent efficiency compared to a first-class line infantry division in a static role, and fifteen per cent in a counter-attack role. Allied intelligence also indicated that two companies of armour were in the area, as were a number of &quot;ad hoc&quot; infantry formations formed from training establishments. Based near Caen, in support of the static divisions, was the 21st Panzer Division. The 125th &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; Regiment was billeted at Vimont, just east of Caen, and the 2nd Battalion, 192nd &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; Regiment was based at Cairon to the west of the Caen canal and the River Orne bridges.

Although a new formation equipped with an assortment of older tanks and other armoured vehicles, the core of the division were &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; veterans. Further afield was the Panzer Lehr Division, based at Chartres, which was less than a day&#x27;s march from the area. Also considered a threat to the airborne forces was the &quot;Waffen SS&quot; 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, based at Lisieux and believed capable of arriving in the vicinity of the airborne landings within twelve hours. The division possessed a large number of tanks and self-propelled guns, including the Panther.

Under the orders of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces had constructed a large number of static defensive positions and obstacles. Rommel had been appointed Inspector General of Coastal Defences and commander of Army Group B, in November 1943, by order of Adolf Hitler. On his arrival he had assessed the existing defences in the region and immediately began the process of improving them, particularly those situated inland as he believed no more than thirty per cent of the German defences were adequate. These anti-airborne measures consisted of planting a large number of mines to create minefields, as well as the erection of so-called Rommel&#x27;s asparagus; a system of wire-braced poles up to two metres in height, a great many of which were laced with mines or other booby-traps aimed at destroying gliders and killing or wounding airborne troops.

Rommel noted in his diary, following an inspection of one area, that a division had placed over 300,000 stakes in the ground to deter airborne landings, and a corps had erected over 900,000. The Merville artillery battery was a particularly heavily fortified position. From the beach, it was protected by two strongpoints that included approximately thirty bunkers as well as an observation post, and the battery itself consisted of a bunker containing the battery&#x27;s command post, two blockhouses, a light flak emplacement and four casemates able to contain artillery pieces up to dimensions of 150 mm. The entire battery covered an area roughly four hundred metres in diameter and was surrounded by an inner perimeter of barbed wire, a minefield, and an outer perimeter of barbed wire as well as an anti-tank ditch.

== Battle ==

=== Fly-in ===

Operation Tonga began at 22:56 on the night of 5 June, when six Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers took off from RAF Tarrant Rushton towing six Horsa gliders carrying the coup-de-main force; this consisted of D Company, 2nd Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, but attached to the 5th Parachute Brigade for the initial invasion) reinforced with two extra platoons from B Company and a party of Royal Engineer sappers under the overall command of Major John Howard, who were tasked with capturing the bridges over the Caen Canal and the River Orne.

A few minutes later, between 23:00 and 23:20, six Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle transports took off carrying pathfinders of the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, who were to mark the three drop-zones to be used by the airborne troops of the division. Another sixteen Albemarles followed the transports carrying the pathfinders, these transported elements of the 9th Parachute Battalion, 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, and 3rd Parachute Brigade Headquarters.

Thirty minutes later, the remainder of the transports carrying the division began to take off. This wave was divided into three groups. The first consisted of 239 Douglas Dakota and Short Stirling transports as well as seventeen Horsa gliders, carrying the bulk of the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades and their heavy equipment. These forces were due to land in their respective drop-zones at 00:50. The second group was destined to land at 03:20, and consisted of sixty-five Horsa and four Hamilcar gliders transporting the divisional headquarters and an anti-tank battery. The final group was formed of three Horsa gliders carrying sappers and men from the 9th Parachute Battalion, who were to land atop Merville Battery at 04:30.

=== Capture of the Caen canal and Orne river bridges ===
The first unit of the 6th Airborne Division to land in Normandy, was Howard&#x27;s coup-de-main force. The coup-de-main force landed in six gliders, over a five-minute period (00:15–00:20); three landing near the Caen canal bridge and two near the Orne River bridge and the third destined for the Orne River bridge some seven miles away due to a navigational error. Once on the ground, the troops emerged and assaulted the German positions. At the Caen canal bridge, troops assaulted German trench positions, attacked sentries, and threw grenades into a concrete bunker believed to hold the triggering equipment for the bridge demolition charges.

At the Orne River bridge, a machine-gun nest was suppressed with mortar fire but no other defenders were found, and the two platoons captured the bridge before radioing Howard and informing him of their success. Both bridges had been secured within fifteen minutes, at the cost of only a small number of casualties. It was also discovered that the bridges had not been rigged with explosives as believed.

While the force waited for the rest of the division to land, and for the 7th Parachute Battalion to arrive to reinforce their position, they had to repel several spontaneous attempts by the Germans to re-take the bridges. At 01:30, two German tanks attempted to drive onto the bridge, but were repelled with the loss of one tank to a PIAT anti-tank weapon.

=== Pathfinders ===
The coup-de-main force had been followed closely by the pathfinders of the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, tasked with marking out the drop-zones and landing-zones to be used by the rest of the division. However, due to a combination of heavy cloud cover and poor navigation, only one pathfinder team was dropped correctly. The aircraft carrying the remainder had to make between two and three runs over their respective drop-zones before their teams jumped. Pathfinders assigned to DZ N were dropped wide, and did not manage to get to the drop-zone for thirty minutes.

One of the teams assigned to DZ K accidentally dropped onto DZ N without realising their error, and set up radio beacons and markers that caused a number of airborne troops to drop in the wrong area. The Pathfinders &#x27;stick&#x27; on DZ K commanded by Lt Bob Midwood were successful. A pathfinder team belonging to 9th Parachute Battalion, assigned to mark out the drop-zone area for the unit tasked with destroying the Merville artillery battery, was all but wiped out when an air-raid by RAF Avro Lancaster heavy bombers missed the artillery battery itself and bombed the area the team was in.

=== 5th Parachute Brigade ===
Due to the above factors, Brigadier Nigel Poett&#x27;s 5th Parachute Brigade was scattered and dropped incorrectly. The constituent units of 7th Parachute Battalion were so badly scattered that, by 03:00, the battalion&#x27;s commander could only command around 40 per cent of the battalion, although more men arrived throughout the night and day. Relatively few supply containers had been found by the airborne troops, meaning that they possessed few heavy weapons or radio sets. However, the 7th Battalion managed to rendezvous with 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, and establish a defence against German counter-attacks. The first organised German responses to the capture of the bridges came between 05:00 and 07:00, and consisted of isolated and often uncoordinated attacks by tanks, armoured cars, and infantry that grew in intensity throughout the day. At 10:00, the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) attempted to destroy the Caen bridge. A lone aircraft dropped a bomb, which failed to detonate. Furthermore, two German coastal craft attempted to attack the bridge and were repelled.

As the day progressed, the 2nd Battalion, 192nd &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; Regiment counterattacked in the Bénouville area in an attempt to get through to the bridges. The coup-de-main force and the 7th Parachute Battalion held their position, knocking out 13 of the 17 tanks trying to get through. The British troops moved forward into Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at the bridges. Despite the ferocity of the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.
The brigade&#x27;s other two battalions, the 12th and 13th, were also badly scattered when they were dropped at 00:50. When both units moved away from their rendezvous points neither had more than sixty per cent of their strength, although individual airborne troops and small groups would join the battalions throughout the day. Both of the battalions had been tasked with securing the area around DZ N and the two bridges captured by the coup-de-main force, a task which was made much more difficult by being scattered throughout the area. The 12th Parachute Battalion&#x27;s mission was to secure the village of Le Bas de Ranville, which it did so by 04:00. The 13th Parachute Battalion was to capture the town of Ranville, which it achieved around the same time albeit against heavier resistance than that encountered by the other battalion.

One company from 13th Parachute Battalion was detailed to remain at the battalion drop-zone in order to provide protection for a company of sappers. The latter were to demolish the poles and explosives that were present in the area, so that the 6th Airborne Division headquarters could land safely. The two battalions held their respective areas until relieved by ground forces advancing from the beaches. The 12th Parachute Battalion was bombarded with heavy mortar and artillery fire, and repelled two German counter-attacks by the 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment; the first was defeated after destroying a tank and taking a number of prisoners, and the second was repulsed with the help of an air-landed anti-tank battery which had recently arrived.

=== 3rd Parachute Brigade ===
The 3rd Parachute Brigade (Brigadier James Hill) began to land at the same time as the main elements of 5th Parachute Brigade, and suffered from the same problems. All of its constituent units were scattered throughout the area due to poor navigation, heavy cloud cover, and several of the drop-zones either not being marked correctly or marked correctly but incorrectly positioned due to pathfinder error.

The 8th Parachute Battalion, tasked with destroying two bridges near Bures and a third by Troarn, was widely scattered with a number of its paratroopers landing in the operational area of 5th Parachute Brigade. When the commanding officer, Alastair Pearson, arrived at the battalion rendezvous point at 01:20, he found only thirty paratroopers and a small group of sappers with a Jeep and trailer. By 03:30, this number had increased to just over 140 paratroopers yet there were still no sign of the sappers who would be required to demolish the bridges.

Pearson therefore decided to send a small force to demolish the bridges at Bures, and lead the rest of the battalion to a crossroad north of Troarn where it would await more reinforcements before it attacked. The force sent to Bures discovered that the two bridges had already been demolished by a group of sappers, who had reached the bridges a few hours earlier, and so rejoined the battalion near Troarn that had now increased in numbers after another fifty men had arrived. A reconnaissance party, and a party of sappers, was sent into Troarn to ascertain the status of the bridge. These troops came under fire, from a German-occupied house near the bridge.

After a brief fire-fight, the paratroopers captured a number of Germans from the 21st Panzer Division. The airborne troops then made their way to the bridge, which they discovered had been partially demolished already. Once the sappers had widened the length of the bridge demolished, using their explosives, the reconnaissance force withdrew back to the rest of the battalion at the crossroad. Having achieved its objective, the battalion then moved north and took up positions near Le Mesnil to widen the airborne bridgehead formed by the division.
The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was allotted, as its primary task, the demolition of two bridges: one at Varaville and another at Robehomme. Much like the rest of the units in the division, the battalion was scattered throughout the operational area. One group of paratroopers landed away from their drop-zone, and another landed only a short distance from the invasion beaches. A number were dropped in flooded areas around Varaville, and several drowned when they were dragged under the surface of the water due to the weight of their equipment.

A group of paratroopers moved towards the Robehomme bridge, encountering and gathering together several other groups of airborne troops and sappers en route, before reaching the bridge where they discovered it was still intact. By 03:00, the sappers tasked with the demolition of the bridge had failed to arrive, and so the paratroopers gathered together the small amount of explosives they possessed and set them off, weakening the bridge. The sappers finally arrived at 06:00, and completed the demolition of the bridge whilst the paratroopers protected them.

Meanwhile, another company of the battalion had been attempting to complete the tasks it had been ordered to fulfill; it was to clear the enemy garrison from Varaville and destroy a gun emplacement, demolish a bridge over the River Divette, and also destroy a radio transmitter near Varaville. However, the company was severely understrength, with only a fraction of its 100 men available.

A small group, led by the company commander, assaulted the fortifications outside Varaville that were manned by approximately ninety-six Germans supported by several machine-gun nests and an artillery piece. The artillery piece inflicted a number of casualties on the small Canadian force, killing the company commander, and a stalemate ensued until 10:00 when the enemy garrison surrendered after being subjected to mortar bombardment. The paratroopers were then relieved by British Commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade.

=== Battle of Merville Gun Battery ===
The 3rd Parachute Brigade&#x27;s 9th Parachute Battalion was assigned a number of objectives: the destruction of the Merville artillery battery, the capture of the village of Le Plein, block the roads leading to that village, and capture a German Navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) headquarters at Sallenelles near the River Orne. However, the battalion was scattered throughout the area with a number of paratroopers landing a considerable distance from the designated DZ. Lieutenant-Colonel Terence Otway, the commander of the battalion, landed with the rest of his stick away from the drop-zone in a farmhouse being used as a command post by a German battalion. After a brief fire-fight and helping other scattered paratroopers, Otway arrived at the drop-zone at 01:30.

By 02:35, only 110 paratroopers had assembled with only a single machine-gun and a small number of Bangalore torpedoes recovered. This was a significant set-back for the battalion, as the plan to assault the artillery battery relied on having the entire battalion present with a number of sappers, as well as a large quantity of heavy equipment. Under strict orders that the battery was to be destroyed no later than 05:30, Otway felt that he could no longer wait for any more men to arrive and set off for the battery with 150 paratroopers (following the arrival of another small group of stragglers at 02:45).

The battalion arrived at the battery at 04:00. They linked up with the survivors of the pathfinder group, who had been earlier hit by an RAF raid against the battery, and began readying for an assault whilst the pathfinders marked out areas for the bangalore torpedoes to be placed. The battalion was divided into four assault groups, one for each of the casemates of the battery, and was ready by 04:30, when the gliders carrying the sappers arrived over the battery.

Of the three gliders assigned to the operation, only two arrived in Normandy; one having to abort and land in England. The remaining two were hit by anti-aircraft fire on their run-in. One landed around away, the other at the edge of the battery&#x27;s minefield. The troops from this glider became involved in a fire fight with German troops heading to reinforce the battery garrison. Otway launched the assault as soon as the first glider overshot the battery, ordering the explosives to be detonated to form two paths through the outer perimeter, through which the paratroopers attacked. The defenders were alerted by the explosions and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties.

Only four men assigned to assault Casemate Four survived long enough to reach it, which they disabled by firing into apertures and throwing grenades into air vents. The other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and white phosphorus grenades as the German crews had neglected to lock the doors leading into the battery. A number of prisoners were taken by the paratroopers, and explosives were then readied to disable the artillery pieces inside the battery. It was discovered that the pieces were not modern 150 mm calibre weapons, but were instead Czechoslovakian First World War-era 100 mm field howitzers.

The paratroopers did the best with the explosives they had, using Gammon bombs to disable one gun and jamming shells into the muzzles of the others. However, the job was less than thorough as at least one gun went back into action when the Germans later re-occupied the battery. Having completed the assault, the paratroopers gathered the German prisoners and their wounded and withdrew, having no wish to remain by the battery. The battalion possessed no radio and if no signal were received by the light cruiser HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot;, by 05:30, it would begin shelling the battery as a contingency.

The paratroopers had achieved their primary objective, but at a heavy cost, with fifty dead and twenty-five wounded; a casualty rate of exactly fifty per cent. The battalion then attacked Le Plein, securing the village by expelling the platoon-sized German garrison. The survivors retired to a planned rendezvous point at 05:30, the battalion too understrength to achieve its other objectives.

=== Divisional HQ, Operation Mallard, and days end ===
At 03:35, the 6th Airborne Division headquarters landed by glider in the landing-zone cleared by sappers. Only a few gliders missed the landing-zone, due to the poor weather and errors in navigation. Once the headquarters staff and accompanying airborne troops had been gathered together, the headquarters was moved to the Le Bas de Ranville area and set up there. Contact was established with the headquarters of 5th Parachute Brigade at 05:00, and with the headquarters of 3rd Parachute Brigade at 12:35, and the division linked up with 1st Special Service Brigade as it advanced from the invasion beaches at 13:53.

At 21:00, Operation Mallard began. Mallard was the final wave of the 6th Airborne Division&#x27;s landings and consisted of 220 Horsa and Hamilcar gliders, carrying the 6th Airlanding Brigade and other units. The gliders arrived at their landing-zone, coming under heavy small-arms and mortar fire from nearby German positions as they landed. Casualties were light and within ninety minutes the glider-borne troops had gathered at their rendezvous points. By 00:00 7 June, the entire 6th Airborne Division had been fully deployed on the eastern flank of the invasion beaches (with the exception of 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment – part of 6th Airlanding Brigade – that was due to arrive by sea on 7 June).
The division ended the day with the 3rd Parachute Brigade holding a front, with 9th Parachute Battalion at Le Plein, 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion at Les Mesneil, and the 8th Parachute Battalion in the southern part of the Bois de Bavent. The 5th Parachute Brigade had the 12th Parachute Battalion occupying Le Bas de Ranville, and the 13th Parachute Battalion holding Ranville while the 7th Parachute Battalion had been moved into reserve. The 6th Airlanding Brigade was poised to commit its two battalions to extend the bridgehead. The 1st Special Service Brigade, which had temporarily came under the command of the division, was holding villages to the north and north-east of DZ N.

== Aftermath ==

=== Analysis ===
Operation Tonga was a success, with all of the tasks allotted to 6th Airborne Division being achieved within the time limits imposed on the individual units of the division. These tasks had been achieved despite the problems caused by a large number of the airborne troops being scattered throughout the operational area assigned, due to a combination of bad weather and poor navigation on the part of the pilots of the transport aircraft carrying them. Glider-borne airborne troops also suffered from navigational errors, with ten of the eighty-five gliders assigned to the division landing more than from their landing-zones. However, an unintended but beneficial result of these scattered drops was that the Germans were greatly confused as to area and extent of the airborne landings.

=== Casualties ===
The 6th Airborne Division suffered a total of 800 casualties between 5 June and 7 June, out of the 8,500 men deployed. German losses are estimated to be estimated 400 dead and a further 400 captured. In addition, fourteen tanks were lost during counterattacks around the Orne River and Caen canal bridges. Other losses include one gunboat on the Caen canal.

=== Subsequent role ===

Between 7 June and 10 June, the 6th Airborne Division repulsed a number of German attacks. The division retained control of the area between the Rivers Orne and Dives until 14 June, when the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division took over the southern part of the Orne bridgehead.

On 10 June, the decision was taken to expand the bridgehead to the east of the River Orne, with 6th Airborne Division tasked with achieving this. However, the division was deemed not to be strong enough to achieve its objective; the 3rd Parachute Brigade was reinforced with the 5th Battalion, Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment). On 11 June, the 5th Black Watch launched an attack on the town of Bréville, but was met with extremely heavy resistance and was repulsed after suffering a number of casualties. The next day, the 3rd Parachute Brigade&#x27;s entire front was subjected to fierce artillery bombardment and assaults by German tanks and infantry, with the Germans particularly focusing on the positions held by 9th Parachute Battalion.

Both the 9th Parachute Battalion and the remnants of the Black Watch defended Chateau Saint Come, but were gradually forced to retreat. However, after Lieutenant-Colonel Otway stated that his battalion would be unable to defend its position for much longer, Brigadier Hill gathered together a number of paratroopers from 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and led a counter-attack that forced the Germans to withdraw.

In the weeks that followed, the 6th Airborne Division was reinforced with the Dutch Princess Irene Brigade and the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade. On 7 August, following a period of static warfare, the division began preparations for offensive operations. On the night of 16/17 August, the division began to advance against stiff German opposition. This advance continued until 26 August, when the division reached its objective – the mouth of the River Seine. In nine days of fighting, it had advanced despite, as Gale put it, the infantry units being &quot;quite inadequately equipped for a rapid pursuit&quot;. The advanced resulted in the liberation of of German-occupied France, and the capture of over 1,000 German soldiers.

Between 6 June and 26 August, casualties amounted to 4,457 men of which 821 were killed, 2,709 wounded, and 927 were reported missing. The division was finally withdrawn from the frontline on 27 August, and embarked for England at the beginning of September.

<text>The Bridge is a novel by Scottish author Iain Banks. It was published in 1986. The book switches between three protagonists, John Orr, Alex, and the Barbarian. It is an unconventional love story.

==Plot summary==

&quot;The road cleared the cutting through the hills. He could see South Queensferry, the marina at Port Edgar, the VAT 69 sign of the distillery there, the lights of Hewlett-Packard’s factory; and the rail bridge, dark in the evening’s last sky-reflected light. Behind it, more lights; the Hound Point oil terminal they’d had a sub-contract on, and, further away, the lights of Leith. The old rail bridge’s hollow metal bones looked the colour of dried blood.
You fucking beauty, he thought . . . What a gorgeous great device you are. So delicate from this distance, so massive and strong close-up. Elegance and grace; perfect form. A quality bridge; granite piers, the best ship-plate steel, and a never-ending paint job...&quot;
The three main characters represent different elements of the protagonist. Alex (full name hinted to be Alexander Lennox, but never explicitly named), John Orr and The Barbarian are one.

Alex is a real person, born in Glasgow, who studied geology and engineering at the University of Edinburgh, fell in love with Andrea Cramond while there, and has continued their (open) relationship ever since. He is embittered by his betrayal of his working-class roots (he has become a manager and partner in his engineering firm), the Cold War, successive Thatcher governments, and the failure of his relationship under the pressure of Andrea&#x27;s French lover&#x27;s terminal illness. While returning from a sentimental reunion with an old friend in Fife, during which alcohol and cannabis are consumed, he becomes distracted by the power and beauty of the Forth Railway Bridge while driving on the neighbouring Forth Road Bridge and crashes his car. While in a coma in hospital, he relives his life up to the crash.
&quot;He glanced back at the roadway of the bridge as it rose slowly to its gentle, suspended summit. The surface was a little damp, but nothing to worry about. No problems. He wasn’t going all that fast anyway, staying in the nearside lane, looking over at the rail bridge downstream. A light winked at the far end of the island under the rail bridge’s middle-section.
One day, though, even you’ll be gone. Nothing lasts. Maybe that’s what I want to tell her. Maybe I want to say, No, of course I don’t mind; you must go. I can’t grudge the man that; you’d have done the same for me and I would for you. Just a pity, that’s all. Go; we’ll all survive. Maybe some good-
He was aware of the truck in front pulling out suddenly. He looked round to see a car in front of him. It was stopped, abandoned in the nearside lane. He sucked his breath in, stamped on the brakes, tried to swerve; but it was too late.&quot;
John Orr is an amnesiac living on the Bridge, a fictional version of the rail bridge, of indeterminate length but at least hundreds of miles long and packed with people. The crash which precipitated his arrival on the bridge was semi-deliberate; as such, he is reluctant to return to the real world. That part of himself who wishes to wake is represented by Dr Joyce, Orr&#x27;s psychoanalyst. Given Orr/Alex&#x27;s desire to remain within the world of the Bridge, a world where he is well treated and lives a fairly pampered life, his attempts to stonewall and block the doctor&#x27;s attempts to cure him are understandable. Eventually, he stows away on a train and leaves the Bridge. He finds that, in stark contrast to the very orderly, indeed totalitarian, life on The Bridge, the countryside beyond exists in militaristic chaos and warfare.

The Barbarian is an id-ish warrior with a superego-esque familiar in tow (phallic symbolism is referenced by the familiar within a few pages of their first appearance) whose hack-and slash antics through various parodies of Greek legends and fairy tales are phonetically rendered in Scots dialect (seven years before Irvine Welsh used the technique in &quot;Trainspotting&quot;). The Barbarian (along with his loquacious familiar) are a deep expression of Alex&#x27;s character; when Orr&#x27;s dreams are not themed around threat and opposition he dreams he is the Barbarian.

The Barbarian appears to be an expression of Alex&#x27;s deepest feelings. A woman is his enemy in their first appearance (Metamorphosis, Four), showing how Andrea Cramond has made her influence felt in Alex&#x27;s very core, and how his love for her has been eroded and has transmuted into anger and contempt through the rift that has opened in their relationship.

In their second appearance (Metamorphosis, Four), a female character is mentioned in passing, with a certain level of affection.

The third appearance of the Barbarian and familiar (Metamorphosis, Pliocene) sees them old, decrepit, bed-bound and heading inevitably towards death. In each successive chapter the Barbarian&#x27;s Scottish accent becomes less and less pronounced, another indication of how far Alex has gone from his Glaswegian roots. The Barbarian talks of his grief over his dead wife and his memories of their life together. While comparisons have been drawn between Sigmund Freud&#x27;s structural theory of personality, this is the only point where the Barbarian, Familiar and another individual get together in a three-way arrangement. If the Barbarian&#x27;s wife represents Andrea Cramond, it is another example of how deeply she has penetrated his being. In a move mirroring Alex&#x27;s suicide drive and anticipating the end of the book, he is placed in a situation likely to kill him, but triumphs and emerges (literally) rejuvenated and reinvigorated. His Glasgow accent also returns.

&quot;The Bridge&quot; is an unconventional love story; the characters eschew fidelity and barely see each other for years at a time, but they keep returning to each other. There is no marriage, no ring, no happy ever after, just the knowledge that their lives are so deeply entwined it would be difficult or impossible for them to break away from each other.
&quot;You don&#x27;t belong to her and she doesn&#x27;t belong to you, but you&#x27;re both part of each other; if she got up and left now and walked away and you never saw each other again for the rest of your lives, and you lived an ordinary waking life for another fifty years, even so on your deathbed you would know she was part of you.&quot;
The fate of Alex and Andrea is revealed in a passage in a later book, &quot;Complicity&quot;.

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==

Banks said that of his novels, this was his personal favourite. &quot;Definitely the intellectual of the family, it&#x27;s the one that went away to University and got a first. I think The Bridge is the best of my books.&quot;

Kafkaesque and multi-layered, it shares elements in common with his Culture books, even including mention of a knife missile late in the book. However, Banks stated &quot;That one knife missile mention has been enough for purists to claim that, technically, The Bridge is a Culture novel. Tenuous, I&#x27;d say.&quot; Banks said that after this book, he felt his SF and non-SF work diverged.

==Allusions and symbolism==
Some characters are allusions to persons involved in the construction of Forth Railway Bridge: Chief Engineer Arrol refers to the proprietor of the construction company, Sir William Arrol, whilst Engineers Baker and Fowler represent the two principal designers of the bridge, Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Fowler.

<text>The Normandy landings were the landing operations and associated airborne operations on 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during the Second World War. Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day (after the military term), it is the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of France, and the rest of Western Europe, and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.

Planning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on the day selected for D-Day was not ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and time of day, that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt placed Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower in command of Allied forces.

The invasion began shortly after midnight on the morning of 6 June with extensive aerial and naval bombardment as well as an airborne assault—the landing of 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne troops. The early morning aerial assault was soon followed by Allied amphibious landings on the coast of France 06:30. The target stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha.

The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. The highest number of casualties was at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled using specialised tanks.

The Allies were able to establish beachheads at each of the five landing sites on the first day, but Carentan, Saint-Lô, and Bayeux remained in German hands. Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.

==Background==
After the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin began pressing his new allies for the creation of a second front in western Europe. In late May 1942, the Soviet Union and the United States made a joint announcement that a &quot;... full understanding was reached with regard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.&quot; However, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill persuaded US President Franklin D. Roosevelt to postpone the promised invasion as, even with US help, the Allies did not have adequate forces for such an activity.

Instead of an immediate return to France, the western Allies staged offensives in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, where British troops were already stationed. By mid-1943, the campaign in North Africa had been won. The Allies then launched the invasion of Sicily in July 1943 and subsequently invaded the Italian mainland in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion within the next year was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. Initial planning was constrained by the number of available landing craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and Pacific. At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.

The Allies considered four sites for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas-de-Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, it would have been possible for the Germans to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected. With the Pas-de-Calais being the closest point in continental Europe to Britain, the Germans considered it to be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region. But it offered few opportunities for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals, whereas, landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of Cherbourg, coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site. The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would be overcome through the development of artificial Mulberry harbours. A series of modified tanks, nicknamed Hobart&#x27;s Funnies, dealt with specific requirements expected for the Normandy Campaign such as mine clearing, demolishing bunkers, and mobile bridging.

The Allies planned to launch the invasion on 1 May 1944. The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the Quebec Conference in August 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. General Bernard Montgomery was named commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all land forces involved in the invasion. On 31 December 1943, Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions with two more divisions in support. The two generals insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and to hasten the capture of Cherbourg. The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June. Eventually, thirty-nine Allied divisions would be committed to the Battle of Normandy: twenty-two American, twelve British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops.

==Operations==
Operation Overlord was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale lodgement on the continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune. To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields. Elaborate deceptions, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, were undertaken in the months leading up to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion.

The landings were to be preceded by airborne operations near Caen on the eastern flank to secure the Orne River bridges and north of Carentan on the western flank. The Americans, assigned to land at Utah Beach and Omaha Beach, were to attempt to capture Carentan and Saint-Lô the first day, then cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and eventually capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold Beaches and the Canadians at Juno Beach would protect the US flank and attempt to establish airfields near Caen on the first day. (A sixth beach, code-named &quot;Band&quot;, was considered to the east of the Orne). A secure lodgement would be established with all invading forces linked together, with an attempt to hold all territory north of the Avranches-Falaise line within the first three weeks. Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, lasting until all Allied forces reached the River Seine.

==Deception plans==
Under the overall umbrella of Operation Bodyguard, the Allies conducted several subsidiary operations designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the Allied landings. Operation Fortitude included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway, and Fortitude South, a major deception involving the creation of a fictitious First United States Army Group under Lieutenant General George S. Patton, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex. Fortitude South was intended to deceive the Germans into believing that the main attack would take place at Calais. Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there. Patton was stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais.

Many of the German radar stations on the French coast were destroyed in preparation for the landings. In addition, on the night before the invasion, a small group of Special Air Service operators deployed dummy paratroopers over Le Havre and Isigny. These dummies led the Germans to believe that an additional airborne landing had occurred. On that same night, in Operation Taxable, No. 617 Squadron RAF dropped strips of &quot;window&quot;, metal foil that caused a radar return which was mistakenly interpreted by German radar operators as a naval convoy near Le Havre. The illusion was bolstered by a group of small vessels towing barrage balloons. A similar deception was undertaken near Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Pas de Calais area by No. 218 Squadron RAF in Operation Glimmer.

==Weather==

The invasion planners determined a set of conditions involving the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that would be satisfactory on only a few days in each month. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the highest tides. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men would be exposed in the open. Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were unsuitable for a landing: high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets. The weather forecast that reported the storms was sent from a weather station on the western coast of Ireland.

Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on the evening of 4June. He and his meteorological team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June. The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the English Channel and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead on 6 June. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.

Allied control of the Atlantic meant German meteorologists had less information than the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife&#x27;s birthday and to petition Hitler for additional Panzer divisions.

==German order of battle==
Germany had at its disposal fifty divisions in France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany. Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the Eastern Front, meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were &quot;Ostlegionen&quot; (eastern legions)—conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union. They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport. Many German units were under strength.

In early 1944, the German Western Front (OB West) was significantly weakened by personnel and materiel transfers to the Eastern Front. During the Soviet Dnieper–Carpathian offensive (24 December 1943 – 17 April 1944), the German High Command was forced to transfer the entire II SS Panzer Corps from France, consisting of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, as well as the 349th Infantry Division, 507th Heavy Panzer Battalion and the 311th and 322nd StuG Assault Gun Brigades. All told, the German forces stationed in France were deprived of 45,827 troops and 363 tanks, assault guns, and self-propelled anti-tank guns.

The 1st SS Panzer Division &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;, 9th, 11th, 19th and 116th Panzer divisions, alongside the 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot;, had only arrived in France in March–May 1944 for extensive refit after being badly damaged during the Dnieper-Carpathian operation. Seven of the eleven panzer or divisions stationed in France were not fully operational or only partially mobile in early June 1944.

==Atlantic Wall==


Alarmed by the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler had ordered the construction of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, meant that most of the strongpoints were never built. As it was expected to be the site of the invasion, the Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo. Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg, and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions.

Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles to be placed on the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high water mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel&#x27;s order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. The Allied air offensive over Germany had crippled the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and established air supremacy over western Europe, so Rommel knew he could not expect effective air support. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; could muster only 815 aircraft over Normandy in comparison to the Allies&#x27; 9,543. Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as &quot;Rommelspargel&quot; (Rommel&#x27;s asparagus) to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.

German armaments minister Albert Speer notes in his 1969 autobiography that the German high command, concerned about the susceptibility of the airports and port facilities along the North Sea coast, held a conference on 6–8 June 1944 to discuss reinforcing defences in that area. Speer wrote:

==Armoured reserves==
Rommel believed that Germany&#x27;s best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore. He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed as close to the coast as possible. Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected. They believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. He also noted that in the Italian Campaign, the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel&#x27;s opinion was that because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was under way. Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three Panzer divisions under Geyr&#x27;s command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves. Hitler took personal control of four divisions as strategic reserves, not to be used without his direct orders.

For example, the Australian contribution to the operation included a regular Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) squadron, nine Article XV squadrons, and hundreds of personnel posted to RAF units and RN warships. The RAF supplied two-thirds of the aircraft involved in the invasion.

==Coordination with the French Resistance==
Through the London-based &quot;État-major des Forces Françaises de l&#x27;Intérieur&quot; (French Forces of the Interior), the British Special Operations Executive orchestrated a campaign of sabotage to be implemented by the French Resistance. The Allies developed four plans for the Resistance to execute on D-Day and the following days:

* Plan &quot;Vert&quot; was a 15-day operation to sabotage the rail system.
* Plan &quot;Bleu&quot; dealt with destroying electrical facilities.
* Plan &quot;Tortue&quot; was a delaying operation aimed at the enemy forces that would potentially reinforce Axis forces at Normandy.
* Plan &quot;Violet&quot; dealt with cutting underground telephone and teleprinter cables.

The resistance was alerted to carry out these tasks by &quot;messages personnels&quot; transmitted by the BBC&#x27;s French service from London. Several hundred of these messages, which might be snippets of poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking the few that were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.

A 1965 report from the Counter-insurgency Information Analysis Center details the results of the French Resistance&#x27;s sabotage efforts: &quot;In the southeast, 52 locomotives were destroyed on 6 June and the railway line cut in more than 500 places. Normandy was isolated as of 7 June.&quot;

==Naval activity==


Naval operations for the invasion were described by historian Correlli Barnett as a &quot;never surpassed masterpiece of planning&quot;. In overall command was British Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, who had served as Flag officer at Dover during the Dunkirk evacuation four years earlier. He had also been responsible for the naval planning of the invasion of North Africa in 1942, and one of the two fleets carrying troops for the invasion of Sicily the following year.

The invasion fleet, which was drawn from eight different navies, comprised 6,939 vessels: 1,213 warships, 4,126 landing craft of various types, 736 ancillary craft, and 864 merchant vessels. The majority of the fleet was supplied by the UK, which provided 892 warships and 3,261 landing craft. In total there were 195,700 naval personnel involved; of these 112,824 were from the Royal Navy with another 25,000 from the Merchant Navy; 52,889 were American; and 4,998 sailors from other allied countries. The invasion fleet was split into the Western Naval Task Force (under Admiral Alan G. Kirk) supporting the US sectors and the Eastern Naval Task Force (under Admiral Sir Philip Vian) in the British and Canadian sectors. Available to the fleet were five battleships, 20 cruisers, 65 destroyers, and two monitors. German ships in the area on D-Day included three torpedo boats, 29 fast attack craft, 36 R boats, and 35 auxiliary minesweepers and patrol boats. The Germans also had several U-boats available, and all the approaches had been heavily mined.

===Naval losses===
At 05:10, German torpedo boats reached the Eastern Task Force and launched fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer off Sword Beach but missing the British battleships and . After attacking, the German vessels turned away and fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre. Allied losses to mines included the American destroyer off Utah and submarine chaser , a 173-foot patrol craft.

==Bombardment==

Bombing of Normandy began around midnight with more than 2,200 British, Canadian, and US bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely ineffective at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.

Minesweepers began clearing channels for the invasion fleet shortly after midnight and finished just after dawn without encountering the enemy. The Western Task Force included the battleships , , and , plus eight cruisers, twenty-eight destroyers, and one monitor. The Eastern Task Force included the battleships and and the monitor , twelve cruisers, and thirty-seven destroyers. Naval bombardment of areas behind the beach commenced at 05:45, while it was still dark, with the gunners switching to pre-assigned targets on the beach as soon as it was light enough to see, at 05:50. Since troops were scheduled to land at Utah and Omaha starting at 06:30 (an hour earlier than the British beaches), these areas received only about 40 minutes of naval bombardment before the assault troops began to land on the shore.

==Airborne operations==
The success of the amphibious landings depended on the establishment of a secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the build-up of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy&#x27;s ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.

The US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were assigned to objectives west of Utah Beach, where they hoped to capture and control the few narrow causeways through terrain that had been intentionally flooded by the Germans. Reports from Allied intelligence in mid-May of the arrival of the German 91st Infantry Division meant the intended drop zones had to be shifted eastward and to the south. The British 6th Airborne Division, on the eastern flank, was assigned to capture intact the bridges over the Caen Canal and River Orne, destroy five bridges over the Dives to the east, and destroy the Merville Gun Battery overlooking Sword Beach. Free French paratroopers from the British SAS Brigade were assigned to objectives in Brittany from 5 June until August in Operations Dingson, Samwest, and Cooney.

BBC war correspondent Robert Barr described the scene as paratroopers prepared to board their aircraft:

===United States===
The US airborne landings began with the arrival of pathfinders at 00:15. Navigation was difficult because of a bank of thick cloud, and as a result, only one of the five paratrooper drop zones was accurately marked with radar signals and Aldis lamps. Paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, numbering over 13,000 men, were delivered by Douglas C-47 Skytrains of the IX Troop Carrier Command. To avoid flying over the invasion fleet, the planes arrived from the west over the Cotentin Peninsula and exited over Utah Beach.

Paratroops from 101st Airborne were dropped beginning around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve River. The C-47s could not fly in a tight formation because of thick cloud cover, and many paratroopers were dropped far from their intended landing zones. Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both flak and machine-gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes did not have time to open, and others drowned in the flooded fields. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared by members of the 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.

Troops of the 82nd Airborne began arriving around 02:30, with the primary objective of capturing two bridges over the River Merderet and destroying two bridges over the Douve. On the east side of the river, 75 per cent of the paratroopers landed in or near their drop zone, and within two hours they captured the important crossroads at Sainte-Mère-Église (the first town liberated in the invasion) and began working to protect the western flank. Because of the failure of the pathfinders to accurately mark their drop zone, the two regiments dropped on the west side of the Merderet were extremely scattered, with only four per cent landing in the target area. Many landed in nearby swamps, with much loss of life. Paratroopers consolidated into small groups, usually a combination of men of various ranks from different units, and attempted to concentrate on nearby objectives. They captured but failed to hold the Merderet River bridge at La Fière, and fighting for the crossing continued for several days.

Reinforcements arrived by glider around 04:00 (Mission Chicago and Mission Detroit), and 21:00 (Mission Keokuk and Mission Elmira), bringing additional troops and heavy equipment. Like the paratroopers, many landed far from their drop zones. Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty, with heavy cargo such as Jeeps shifting during landing, crashing through the wooden fuselage, and in some cases crushing personnel on board.

After 24 hours, only 2,500 men of the 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne were under the control of their divisions, approximately a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.

===British and Canadian===
The first Allied action of D-Day was the capture of the Caen canal and Orne river bridges via a glider assault at 00:16 (since renamed Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge). Both bridges were quickly captured intact, with light casualties by the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Regiment. They were then reinforced by members of the 5th Parachute Brigade and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The five bridges over the Dives were destroyed with minimal difficulty by the 3rd Parachute Brigade. Meanwhile, the pathfinders tasked with setting up radar beacons and lights for further paratroopers (scheduled to begin arriving at 00:50 to clear the landing zone north of Ranville) were blown off course and had to set up the navigation aids too far east. Many paratroopers, also blown too far east, landed far from their intended drop zones; some took hours or even days to be reunited with their units. Major General Richard Gale arrived in the third wave of gliders at 03:30, along with equipment, such as antitank guns and jeeps, and more troops to help secure the area from counter-attacks, which were initially staged only by troops in the immediate vicinity of the landings. At 02:00, the commander of the German 716th Infantry Division ordered Feuchtinger to move his 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne.

Only 160 men out of the 600 members of the 9th Battalion tasked with eliminating the enemy battery at Merville arrived at the rendezvous point. Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, in charge of the operation, decided to proceed regardless, as the emplacement had to be destroyed by 06:00 to prevent it firing on the invasion fleet and the troops arriving on Sword Beach. In the Battle of Merville Gun Battery, Allied forces disabled the guns with plastic explosives at a cost of 75 casualties. The emplacement was found to contain 75 mm guns rather than the expected 150 mm heavy coastal artillery. Otway&#x27;s remaining force withdrew with the assistance of a few members of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion.

With this action, the last of the D-Day goals of the British 6th Airborne Division was achieved. They were reinforced at 12:00 by commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade, who landed on Sword Beach, and by the 6th Airlanding Brigade, who arrived in gliders at 21:00 in Operation Mallard.

==Beach landings==
===Tanks===
Some of the landing craft had been modified to provide close support fire, and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks (DD tanks), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire. However, few arrived in advance of the infantry, and at Omaha many sank before reaching the shore. Other specialist tanks landed in the early waves to clear the beach defences.

===Utah Beach===
Utah Beach was in the area defended by two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment. Members of the 8th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division were the first to land, arriving at 06:30. Their landing craft were pushed to the south by strong currents, and they found themselves about from their intended landing zone. This site turned out to be better, as there was only one strongpoint nearby rather than two, and bombers of IX Bomber Command had bombed the defences from lower than their prescribed altitude, inflicting considerable damage. In addition, the strong currents had washed ashore many of the underwater obstacles. The assistant commander of the 4th Infantry Division, Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the first senior officer ashore, made the decision to &quot;start the war from right here,&quot; and ordered further landings to be re-routed.

The initial assault battalions were quickly followed by 28 DD tanks and several waves of engineer and demolition teams to remove beach obstacles and clear the area directly behind the beach of obstacles and mines. Gaps were blown in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and tanks. Combat teams began to exit the beach at around 09:00, with some infantry wading through the flooded fields rather than travelling on the single road. They skirmished throughout the day with elements of the 919th Grenadier Regiment, who were armed with antitank guns and rifles. The main strongpoint in the area and another to the south were disabled by noon. The 4th Infantry Division did not meet all of their D-Day objectives at Utah Beach, partly because they had arrived too far to the south, but they landed 21,000 troops at the cost of only 197 casualties.

===Pointe du Hoc===

Pointe du Hoc, a prominent headland situated between Utah and Omaha, was assigned to two hundred men of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Rudder. Their task was to scale the cliffs with grappling hooks, ropes, and ladders to destroy the coastal gun battery located at the top. The cliffs were defended by the German 352nd Infantry Division and French collaborators firing from above. Allied destroyers and provided fire support. After scaling the cliffs, the Rangers discovered that the guns had already been withdrawn. They located the weapons, unguarded but ready to use, in an orchard some south of the point, and disabled them with explosives.

The Rangers fended off numerous counter-attacks from the German 914th Grenadier Regiment. The men were isolated, and some were captured. By dawn on 7 June, Rudder had only 90 men able to fight. Relief did not arrive until 8 June, when members of the 743rd Tank Battalion and others arrived. By then, Rudder&#x27;s men had run out of ammunition and were using captured German weapons. Several men were killed as a result, because the German weapons made a distinctive noise, and the men were mistaken for the enemy. By the end of the battle, the Rangers casualties were 135 dead and wounded, while German casualties were 50 killed and 40 captured. An unknown number of French collaborators were executed.

===Omaha Beach===

Omaha, the most heavily defended beach, was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division and 29th Infantry Division. They faced the 352nd Infantry Division rather than the expected single regiment. Strong currents forced many landing craft east of their intended position or caused them to be delayed. For fear of hitting the landing craft, US bombers delayed releasing their loads and as a result most of the beach obstacles at Omaha remained undamaged when the men came ashore. Many of the landing craft ran aground on sandbars, and the men had to wade 50–100m in water up to their necks while under fire to get to the beach. In spite of the rough seas, DD tanks of two companies of the 741st Tank Battalion were dropped from shore; however, 27 of the 32 flooded and sank, with the loss of 33 crew. Some tanks, disabled on the beach, continued to provide covering fire until their ammunition ran out or they were swamped by the rising tide.

Casualties were around 2,000, as the men were subjected to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started to run out of ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by 9 June.

===Gold Beach===

The first landings on Gold Beach were set for 07:25 because of the differences in the tide between there and the US beaches. High winds made conditions difficult for the landing craft, and the amphibious DD tanks were released close to shore or directly on the beach instead of further out as planned. Three of the four guns in a large emplacement at the Longues-sur-Mer battery were disabled by direct hits from the cruisers HMS and at 06:20. The fourth gun resumed firing intermittently in the afternoon, and its garrison surrendered on 7 June. Aerial attacks had failed to hit the Le Hamel strongpoint, which had its embrasure facing east to provide enfilade fire along the beach and had a thick concrete wall on the seaward side. Its 75 mm gun continued to do damage until 16:00, when an Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) tank fired a large demolition charge into its rear entrance. A second casemated emplacement at La Rivière containing an 88 mm gun had been neutralised by a tank at 07:30.

Meanwhile, infantry began clearing the heavily fortified houses along the shore and advanced on targets further inland. The No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando moved toward the small port at Port-en-Bessin and captured it the following day in the Battle of Port-en-Bessin. Company Sergeant Major Stanley Hollis received the only Victoria Cross awarded on D-Day for his actions including attacking two pillboxes at the Mont Fleury high point. On the western flank, the 1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment captured Arromanches (future site of Mulberry &quot;B&quot;), and contact was made on the eastern flank with the Canadian forces at Juno. Bayeux was not captured the first day because of stiff resistance from the 352nd Infantry Division. Allied casualties at Gold Beach are estimated at 1,000.

===Juno Beach===

The landing at Juno Beach was delayed because of choppy seas, and the men arrived ahead of their supporting armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge. The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.

Major German strongpoints with 75 mm guns, machine-gun nests, concrete fortifications, barbed wire, and mines were located at Courseulles-sur-Mer, St Aubin-sur-Mer, and Bernières-sur-Mer. The towns had to be cleared in house-to-house fighting. Soldiers on their way to Bény-sur-Mer, inland, discovered that the road was well covered by machine gun emplacements that had to be outflanked before the advance could proceed. Elements of the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade advanced to within sight of the Carpiquet airfield late in the afternoon, but by this time their supporting armour was low on ammunition so the Canadians dug in for the night. The airfield was not captured until a month later as the area became the scene of fierce fighting. By nightfall, the contiguous Juno and Gold beachheads covered an area wide and deep. Casualties at Juno were 961 men.

===Sword Beach===

On Sword Beach, 21 of 25 DD tanks of the first wave were successful in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30. The beach was heavily mined and peppered with obstacles, making the work of the beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous. In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult. The beach quickly became congested. Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, piped ashore by Private Bill Millin, Lovat&#x27;s personal piper. Members of No. 4 Commando moved through Ouistreham to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore. A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later. French forces under Commander Philippe Kieffer (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks.

The &#x27;Morris&#x27; strongpoint near Colleville-sur-Orne was captured after about an hour of fighting. The nearby &#x27;Hillman&#x27; strongpoint, headquarters of the 736th Infantry Regiment, was a large complex defensive work that had come through the morning&#x27;s bombardment essentially undamaged. It was not captured until 20:15. The 2nd Battalion, King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry began advancing to Caen on foot, coming within a few kilometres of the town, but had to withdraw due to lack of armour support. At 16:00, the 21st Panzer Division mounted a counter-attack between Sword and Juno and nearly succeeded in reaching the Channel. It met stiff resistance from the British 3rd Division and was soon recalled to assist in the area between Caen and Bayeux. Estimates of Allied casualties on Sword Beach are as high as 1,000.

==Aftermath==
The Normandy landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and assault craft, 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers participating. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day, with 875,000 men disembarking by the end of June. Allied casualties on the first day were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead and the Germans had 4,000–9,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, or captured). The Germans never achieved Hitler&#x27;s stated aim of &quot;throwing the Allies back into the sea&quot; on D-Day or at any time thereafter.

The Allied invasion plans had demanded a rapid build-up of troops and the establishment of a secure bridgehead, which was achieved with fewer casualties than expected. The plan had also called for the capture of Carentan, Saint-Lô, Caen, and Bayeux on the first day, with all the beaches (other than Utah) linked with a front line from the beaches; none of these latter objectives were achieved. At Utah the 4th Division made significant progress inland, making a rendezvous with the airborne troops, and the British and Canadians were between four and seven miles inland (six to eleven kilometres). The five beachheads were not connected until 12 June, by which time the Allies held a front around long and deep. Caen, a major objective, was still in German hands at the end of D-Day and would not be completely captured until 21 July. The Germans had ordered French civilians other than those deemed essential to the war effort to leave potential combat zones in Normandy. Civilian casualties on D-Day and D+1 are estimated at 3,000.

The Allied victory in Normandy stemmed from several factors. German preparations along the Atlantic Wall were only partially finished; shortly before D-Day Rommel reported that construction was only 18 per cent complete in some areas as resources were diverted elsewhere. The deceptions undertaken in Operation Fortitude were successful, leaving the Germans obliged to defend a huge stretch of coastline. Rommel was in Berlin and the forecasted stormy weather meant that some other German commanders and troops were not present in Normandy. The Allies achieved and maintained air supremacy, which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of the preparations underway in Britain and were unable to interfere via bomber attacks. Infrastructure for transport in France was severely disrupted by Allied bombers and the French Resistance, making it difficult for the Germans to bring up reinforcements and supplies. Some of the opening bombardment was off-target or not concentrated enough to have any impact, but the specialised armour worked well except on Omaha (where most of it had been lost at sea), providing close artillery support for the troops as they disembarked onto the beaches. Indecisiveness and an overly complicated command structure on the part of the German high command were also factors in the Allied success.

==War memorials and tourism==
At Omaha Beach, parts of the Mulberry harbour are still visible, and a few of the beach obstacles remain. A memorial to the US National Guard sits at the location of a former German strongpoint. Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place. The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer. A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the US airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église. Two German military cemeteries are located nearby.

Pegasus Bridge, a target of the British 6th Airborne, was the site of some of the earliest action of the Normandy landings. The bridge was replaced in 1994 by one similar in appearance, and the original is housed on the grounds of a nearby museum complex. Sections of Mulberry HarbourB still sit in the sea at Arromanches, and the well-preserved Longues-sur-Mer battery is nearby. The Juno Beach Centre, opened in 2003, was funded by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, France, and Canadian veterans. The British Normandy Memorial above Gold Beach was designed by the architect Liam O&#x27;Connor and opened in 2021.

<text>Operation Gambit was a part of Operation Neptune, the landing phase of the invasion of northern France (Operation Overlord) during the Second World War. Gambit involved two X class submarines (British midget submarines) marking the ends of the Anglo-Canadian invasion beaches. Using navigation lights and flags, the submarines indicated the western and eastern limits of Sword and Juno Beaches. &quot;X20&quot; and &quot;X23&quot; arrived in position on 4 June and due to the delay caused by bad weather, remained in position until on 6 June (D-Day) when they surfaced, erected the navigational aids, an telescopic mast with a light shining to seaward, a radio beacon and echo sounder, tapping out a message for the minelayers approaching Sword and Juno.

A similar operation had been offered to the US landing forces to mark their beaches but this was declined. The team of Captain Logan Scott-Bowden and Sergeant Bruce Ogden-Smith did investigate Omaha Beach for General Omar Bradley, returning with a sand sample. The submarines were at some risk of damage due to friendly fire and to avoid this, Lieutenant George Honour the captain of &quot;X23&quot; flew a White Ensign of the size more normally used by capital ships.

<text>Classified information is material that a government body deems to be sensitive information that must be protected. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of people with the necessary security clearance with a need to know. Mishandling of the material can incur criminal penalties.

A formal security clearance is required to view or handle classified material. The clearance process requires a satisfactory background investigation. Documents and other information must be properly marked &quot;by the author&quot; with one of several (hierarchical) levels of sensitivity—e.g. restricted, confidential, secret, and top secret. The choice of level is based on an impact assessment; governments have their own criteria, including how to determine the classification of an information asset and rules on how to protect information classified at each level. This process often includes security clearances for personnel handling the information.

Some corporations and non-government organizations also assign levels of protection to their private information, either from a desire to protect trade secrets, or because of laws and regulations governing various matters such as personal privacy, sealed legal proceedings and the timing of financial information releases.

With the passage of time much classified information can become less sensitive, and may be declassified and made public. Since the late twentieth century there has been freedom of information legislation in some countries, whereby the public is deemed to have the right to all information that is not considered to be damaging if released. Sometimes documents are released with information still considered confidential obscured (redacted), as in the adjacent example.

The question exists among some political science and legal experts whether the definition of classified ought to be information that would cause injury to the cause of justice, human rights, etc., rather than information that would cause injury to the national interest; to distinguish when classifying information is in the collective best interest of a just society, or merely the best interest of a society acting unjustly to protect its people, government, or administrative officials from legitimate recourses consistent with a fair and just social contract.

==Government classification==
The purpose of classification is to protect information. Higher classifications protect information that might endanger national security. Classification formalises what constitutes a &quot;state secret&quot; and accords different levels of protection based on the expected damage the information might cause in the wrong hands.

However, classified information is frequently &quot;leaked&quot; to reporters by officials for political purposes. Several U.S. presidents have leaked sensitive information to influence public opinion.

Former government intelligence officials are usually able to retain their security clearance, but it is a privilege not a right, with the President being the grantor.

==Typical classification levels==
Although the classification systems vary from country to country, most have levels corresponding to the following British definitions (from the highest level to lowest).

=== Top Secret (TS) ===
&quot;Top Secret&quot; is the highest level of classified information. Information is further compartmented so that specific access using a code word after &quot;top secret&quot; is a legal way to hide collective and important information. Such material would cause &quot;exceptionally grave damage&quot; to national security if made publicly available. Prior to 1942, the United Kingdom and other members of the British Empire used &quot;Most Secret&quot;, but this was later changed to match the United States&#x27; category name of &quot;Top Secret&quot; in order to simplify Allied interoperability.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in an investigation entitled &quot;Top Secret America&quot; that, as of 2010, &quot;An estimated 854,000 people ... hold top-secret security clearances&quot; in the United States.

===Secret===
&quot;Secret&quot; material would cause &quot;serious damage&quot; to national security if it were publicly available.

In the United States, operational &quot;Secret&quot; information can be marked with an additional &quot;LimDis&quot;, to limit distribution.

===Confidential===
&quot;Confidential&quot; material would cause &quot;damage&quot; or be prejudicial to national security if publicly available.

===Restricted===
&quot;Restricted&quot; material would cause &quot;undesirable effects&quot; if publicly available. Some countries do not have such a classification in public sectors, such as commercial industries. Such a level is also known as &quot;&quot;Private&quot; Information&quot;.

===Official===
&quot;Official&quot; (equivalent to US DOD classification Controlled Unclassified Information or CUI) material forms the generality of government business, public service delivery and commercial activity. This includes a diverse range of information, of varying sensitivities, and with differing consequences resulting from compromise or loss. Official information must be secured against a threat model that is broadly similar to that faced by a large private company.

The Official Sensitive classification replaced the Restricted classification in April 2014 in the UK; Official indicates the previously used Unclassified marking.

===Unclassified===
&quot;Unclassified&quot; is technically not a classification level. Though this is a feature of some classification schemes, used for government documents that do not merit a particular classification or which have been declassified. This is because the information is low-impact, and therefore does not require any special protection, such as vetting of personnel.

A plethora of pseudo-classifications exist under this category.

===Clearance===
&quot;Clearance&quot; is a general classification, that comprises a variety of rules controlling the level of permission required to view some classified information, and how it must be stored, transmitted, and destroyed. Additionally, access is restricted on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis. Simply possessing a clearance does not automatically authorize the individual to view all material classified at that level or below that level. The individual must present a legitimate &quot;need to know&quot; in addition to the proper level of clearance.

===Compartmented information===
In addition to the general risk-based classification levels, additional compartmented constraints on access exist, such as (in the U.S.) Special Intelligence (SI), which protects intelligence sources and methods, No Foreign dissemination (NoForn), which restricts dissemination to U.S. nationals, and Originator Controlled dissemination (OrCon), which ensures that the originator can track possessors of the information. Information in these compartments is usually marked with specific keywords in addition to the classification level.

Government information about nuclear weapons often has an additional marking to show it contains such information (CNWDI).

==International==
When a government agency or group shares information between an agency or group of other country&#x27;s government they will generally employ a special classification scheme that both parties have previously agreed to honour.

For example, the marking Atomal, is applied to U.S. Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data and United Kingdom Atomic information that has been released to NATO. Atomal information is marked COSMIC Top Secret Atomal (CTSA), NATO Secret Atomal (NSAT), or NATO Confidential Atomal (NCA). BALK and BOHEMIA are also used.

===NATO classifications===

For example, sensitive information shared amongst NATO allies has four levels of security classification; from most to least classified:
# COSMIC Top Secret (CTS) 
# NATO Secret (NS)
# NATO Confidential (NC)
# NATO Restricted (NR)

* ATOMAL: This designation is added to the NATO security classification when applicable. For example, COSMIC TOP SECRET ATOMAL (CTS-A). ATOMAL information applies to U.S. RESTRICTED DATA or FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA or United Kingdom Atomic Information released to NATO.

A special case exists with regard to NATO Unclassified (NU) information. Documents with this marking are NATO property (copyright) and must not be made public without NATO permission.

COSMIC is an acronym for &quot;Control of Secret Material in an International Command&quot;.

===International organizations===
* The European Union has four levels: EU Top Secret, EU Secret, EU Confidential, EU Restricted. (Note that usually the French terms are used.)
**&quot;Très Secret UE&quot;/EU Top Secret: information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause exceptionally grave prejudice to the essential interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States;
**&quot;Secret UE&quot;/EU Secret: information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could seriously harm the essential interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States;
**&quot;Confidentiel UE&quot;/EU Confidential: information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could harm the essential interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States;
**&quot;Restreint UE&quot;/EU Restricted: information and material the unauthorised disclosure of which could be disadvantageous to the interests of the European Union or of one or more of the Member States.
* Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation, a European defence organisation, has three levels of classification: OCCAR Secret, OCCAR Confidential, and OCCAR Restricted.
* ECIPS, the European Centre for Information Policy and Security, has four levels of Security Information, COSMIC (Top Secret), EC-Secret, EC-Confidential and EC-Committees.
* The United Nations has two classification levels: Confidential and Strictly Confidential.

==By country==

Most countries employ some sort of classification system for certain government information. For example, in Canada, information that the U.S. would classify SBU (Sensitive but Unclassified) is called &quot;protected&quot; and further subcategorised into levels A, B, and C.

===Australia===
On 19 July 2011, the National Security (NS) classification marking scheme and the Non-National Security (NNS) classification marking scheme in Australia was unified into one structure.

As of 2018, the policy detailing how Australian government entities handle classified information is defined in the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF). The PSPF is published by the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department and covers security governance, information security, personal security, and physical security.  A security classification can be applied to the information itself or an asset that holds information e.g., a USB or laptop.

The Australian Government uses four security classifications: OFFICIAL: Sensitive, PROTECTED, SECRET and TOP SECRET. The relevant security classification is based on the likely damage resulting from compromise of the information’s confidentiality..

All other information from business operations and services requires a routine level of protection and is treated as OFFICIAL. Information that does not form part of official duty is treated as UNOFFICIAL.

OFFICIAL and UNOFFICIAL are not security classifications and are not mandatory markings.

Caveats are a warning that the information has special protections in addition to those indicated by the security classification of PROTECTED or higher (or in the case of the NATIONAL CABINET caveat, OFFICIAL: Sensitive or higher). Australia has four caveats:

* Codewords (sensitive compartmented information)
* Foreign government markings
* Special handling instructions
* Releasability caveats
Codewords are primarily used within the national security community. Each codeword identifies a special need-to-know compartment.

Foreign government markings are applied to information created by Australian agencies from foreign source information. Foreign government marking caveats require protection at least equivalent to that required by the foreign government providing the source information.

Special handling instructions are used to indicate particular precautions for information handling. They include:

* EXCLUSIVE FOR (named person)
* CABINET
* NATIONAL CABINET

A releasability caveat restricts information based on citizenship. The three in use are: 

* Australian Eyes Only (AUSTEO)
* Australian Government Access Only (AGAO) 
* Releasable To (REL).

Additionally, the PSPF outlines Information Management Markers (IMM) as a way for entities to identify information that is subject to non-security related restrictions on access and use. These are:

* Legal privilege
* Legislative secret
* Personal privacy

===Brazil===
There are three levels of document classification under Brazilian Law No. 12.527, the &quot;Access to Information Act&quot;: (top secret), (secret) and (restricted).

A top secret () government-issued document may be classified for a period of 25 years, which may be extended up to another 25 years. Thus, no document remains classified for more than 50 years. This is mandated by the 2011 Information Access Law (), a change from the previous rule, under which documents could have their classification time length renewed indefinitely, effectively shuttering state secrets from the public. The 2011 law applies retroactively to existing documents.

===Canada===
====Background and hierarchy====
The government of Canada employs two main types of sensitive information designation: Classified and Protected. The access and protection of both types of information is governed by the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot;, effective 24 December 2001, replacing the &quot;Official Secrets Act 1981&quot;. To access the information, a person must have the appropriate security clearance and the need to know.

In addition, the caveat &quot;Canadian Eyes Only&quot; is used to restrict access to Classified or Protected information only to Canadian citizens with the appropriate security clearance and need to know.

====Special operational information====
SOI is not a classification of data &quot;per se&quot;. It is defined under the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot;, and unauthorised release of such information constitutes a higher breach of trust, with a penalty of up to life imprisonment if the information is shared with a foreign entity or terrorist group.

SOIs include:
* military operations in respect of a potential, imminent or present armed conflict
* the identity of confidential source of information, intelligence or assistance to the Government of Canada
* tools used for information gathering or intelligence
* the object of a covert investigation, or a covert collection of information or intelligence
* the identity of any person who is under covert surveillance
* encryption and cryptographic systems
* information or intelligence to, or received from, a foreign entity or terrorist group

In February 2025, the Department of National Defence announced a new category of Persons Permanently Bound to Security (PPBS). The protection would apply to some units, sections or elements, and select positions (both current and former), with access to sensitive Special Operational Information (SOI) for national defense and intelligence work. If a unit or organization routinely handles SOI, all members of that unit will be automatically bound to secrecy. If an individual has direct access to SOI, deemed to be integral to national security, that person may be recommended for PPBS designation. The designation is for life, punishable by imprisonment.

====Classified information====
Classified information can be designated &quot;Top Secret&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot; or &quot;Confidential&quot;. These classifications are only used on matters of national interest.
* Top Secret: applies when compromise might reasonably cause exceptionally grave injury to the national interest. The possible impact must be great, immediate and irreparable.
* Secret: applies when compromise might reasonably cause serious injury to the national interest.
* Confidential: disclosure might reasonably cause injury to the national interest.

====Protected information====
Protected information is not classified. It pertains to any sensitive information that does not relate to national security and cannot be disclosed under the access and privacy legislation because of the potential injury to particular public or private interests.
* Protected C (Extremely Sensitive protected information): designates extremely sensitive information, which if compromised, could reasonably be expected to cause extremely grave injury outside the national interest. Examples include bankruptcy, identities of informants in criminal investigations, etc.
* Protected B (Particularly Sensitive protected information): designates information that could cause severe injury or damage to the people or group involved if it was released. Examples include medical records, annual personnel performance reviews, income tax returns, etc.
* Protected A (Low-Sensitive protected information): designates low sensitivity information that should not be disclosed to the public without authorization and could reasonably be expected to cause injury or embarrassment outside the national interest. Example of Protected A information include employee identification number, pay deposit banking information, etc.

Federal Cabinet (King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada) papers are either protected (e.g., overhead slides prepared to make presentations to Cabinet) or classified (e.g., draft legislation, certain memos).

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

The Criminal Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (which is not operative in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau) makes it a crime to release a state secret. Regulation and enforcement is carried out by the National Administration for the Protection of State Secrets.

Under the 1989 &quot;Law on Guarding State Secrets&quot;, state secrets are defined as those that concern:

# Major policy decisions on state affairs
# The building of national defence and in the activities of the armed forces
# Diplomatic activities and in activities related to foreign countries and those to be maintained as commitments to foreign countries
# National economic and social development
# Science and technology
# Activities for preserving state security and the investigation of criminal offences
# Any other matters classified as &quot;state secrets&quot; by the national State Secrets Bureau

Secrets can be classified into three categories:
* Top Secret (), defined as &quot;vital state secrets whose disclosure would cause extremely serious harm to state security and national interests&quot;
* Highly Secret (), defined as &quot;important state secrets whose disclosure would cause serious harm to state security and national interests&quot;
* Secret (), defined as &quot;ordinary state secrets whose disclosure would cause harm to state security and national interests&quot;

===France===
In France, classified information is defined by article 413-9 of the Penal Code. The three levels of military classification are
* (Very Secret Defence): Information deemed extremely harmful to national defence, and relative to governmental priorities in national defence. No service or organisation can elaborate, process, stock, transfer, display or destroy information or protected supports classified at this level without authorization from the Prime Minister or the national secretary for National Defence. Partial or exhaustive reproduction is strictly forbidden.
* (Secret Defence): Information deemed very harmful to national defence. Such information cannot be reproduced without authorisation from the emitting authority, except in exceptional emergencies.
* (Confidential Defence): Information deemed potentially harmful to national defence, or that could lead to uncovering some information classified at a higher level of security.

Less sensitive information is &quot;protected&quot;. The levels are
* (&quot;Confidential officers&quot;)
* (&quot;Confidential non-commissioned officers&quot;)
* (&quot;restricted information&quot;)
* (&quot;administrative restricted information&quot;)
* (unprotected)

A further caveat, (reserved France) restricts the document to French citizens (in its entirety or by extracts). This is not a classification level.

Declassification of documents can be done by the (CCSDN), an independent authority. Transfer of classified information is done with double envelopes, the outer layer being plastified and numbered, and the inner in strong paper. Reception of the document involves examination of the physical integrity of the container and registration of the document. In foreign countries, the document must be transferred through specialised military mail or diplomatic bag. Transport is done by an authorised conveyor or habilitated person for mail under 20 kg. The letter must bear a seal mentioning &quot;&quot;. Once a year, ministers have an inventory of classified information and supports by competent authorities.

Once their usage period is expired, documents are transferred to archives, where they are either destroyed (by incineration, crushing, or overvoltage), or stored.

In case of unauthorized release of classified information, competent authorities are the Ministry of Interior, the &#x27; (&quot;high civil servant for defence and security&quot;) of the relevant ministry, and the General secretary for National Defence. Violation of such secrets is an offence punishable with seven years of imprisonment and a 100,000 euro fine; if the offence is committed by imprudence or negligence, the penalties are three years of imprisonment and a 45,000 euro fine.

===Hong Kong===
The Security Bureau is responsible for developing policies in regards to the protection and handling of confidential government information. In general, the system used in Hong Kong is very similar to the UK system, developed from the Colonial Hong Kong era.

Four classifications exists in Hong Kong, from highest to lowest in sensitivity:
* Top Secret ()
* Secret ()
* Confidential ()
** Temporary Confidential ()
* Restricted ()
** Restricted (staff) ()
** Restricted (tender) ()
** Restricted (administration) ()

Restricted documents are not classified &quot;per se&quot;, but only those who have a need to know will have access to such information, in accordance with the &quot;Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance&quot;.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand uses the Restricted classification, which is lower than Confidential. People may be given access to Restricted information on the strength of an authorisation by their Head of department, without being subjected to the background vetting associated with Confidential, Secret and Top Secret clearances. New Zealand&#x27;s security classifications and the national-harm requirements associated with their use are roughly similar to those of the United States.

In addition to national security classifications there are two additional security classifications, In Confidence and Sensitive, which are used to protect information of a policy and privacy nature. There are also a number of information markings used within ministries and departments of the government, to indicate, for example, that information should not be released outside the originating ministry.

Because of strict privacy requirements around personal information, personnel files are controlled in all parts of the public and private sectors. Information relating to the security vetting of an individual is usually classified at the In Confidence level.

===Romania===
In Romania, classified information is referred to as &quot;state secrets&quot; () and is defined by the Penal Code as &quot;documents and data that manifestly appear to have this status or have been declared or qualified as such by decision of Government&quot;. There are three levels of classification—Secret, Top Secret, and Top Secret of Particular Importance. The levels are set by the Romanian Intelligence Service and must be aligned with NATO regulations—in case of conflicting regulations, the latter are applied with priority. Dissemination of classified information to foreign agents or powers is punishable by up to life imprisonment, if such dissemination threatens Romania&#x27;s national security.

===Russia===
In the Russian Federation, a state secret (Государственная тайна) is information protected by the state on its military, foreign policy, economic, intelligence, counterintelligence, operational and investigative and other activities, dissemination of which could harm state security.

===Sweden===

The Swedish classification has been updated due to increased NATO/PfP cooperation. All classified defence documents will now have both a Swedish classification (, , or ), and an English classification (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, or Restricted). The term , &quot;protected identity&quot;, is used in the case of protection of a threatened person, basically implying &quot;secret identity&quot;, accessible only to certain members of the police force and explicitly authorised officials.

===Switzerland===
At the federal level, classified information in Switzerland is assigned one of three levels, which are from lowest to highest: Internal, Confidential, Secret. Respectively, these are, in German, , , ; in French, , , ; in Italian, , , . As in other countries, the choice of classification depends on the potential impact that the unauthorised release of the classified document would have on Switzerland, the federal authorities or the authorities of a foreign government.

According to the Ordinance on the Protection of Federal Information, information is classified as Internal if its &quot;disclosure to unauthorised persons may be disadvantageous to national interests.&quot; Information classified as Confidential could, if disclosed, compromise &quot;the free formation of opinions and decision-making of the Federal Assembly or the Federal Council,&quot; jeopardise national monetary/economic policy, put the population at risk or adversely affect the operations of the Swiss Armed Forces. Finally, the unauthorised release of Secret information could seriously compromise the ability of either the Federal Assembly or the Federal Council to function or impede the ability of the Federal Government or the Armed Forces to act.

=== Turkey ===
According to the related regulations in Turkey, there are four levels of document classification: (top secret), (secret), (confidential) and (restricted). The fifth is , which means unclassified.

===United Kingdom===
Until 2013, the United Kingdom used five levels of classification—from lowest to highest, they were: Protect, Restricted, Confidential, Secret and Top Secret (formerly Most Secret). The Cabinet Office provides guidance on how to protect information, including the security clearances required for personnel. Staff may be required to sign to confirm their understanding and acceptance of the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989, although the Act applies regardless of signature. Protect is not in itself a security protective marking level (such as Restricted or greater), but is used to indicate information which should not be disclosed because, for instance, the document contains tax, national insurance, or other personal information.

Government documents without a classification may be marked as Unclassified or Not Protectively Marked.

This system was replaced by the Government Security Classifications Policy, which has a simpler model: Top Secret, Secret, and Official from April 2014. Official Sensitive is a security marking which may be followed by one of three authorised descriptors: Commercial, LocSen (location sensitive) or Personal. Secret and Top Secret may include a caveat such as UK Eyes Only.

Also useful is that scientific discoveries may be classified via the D-Notice system if they are deemed to have applications relevant to national security. These may later emerge when technology improves so for example the specialised processors and routing engines used in graphics cards are loosely based on top secret military chips designed for code breaking and image processing.
They may or may not have safeguards built in to generate errors when specific tasks are attempted and this is invariably independent of the card&#x27;s operating system.

===United States===

The U.S. classification system is currently established under Executive Order 13526 and has three levels of classification—Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. The U.S. had a Restricted level during World War II but no longer does. U.S. regulations state that information received from other countries at the Restricted level should be handled as Confidential. A variety of markings are used for material that is not classified, but whose distribution is limited administratively or by other laws, e.g., For Official Use Only (FOUO), or Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU). The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provides for the protection of information related to the design of nuclear weapons. The term &quot;Restricted Data&quot; is used to denote certain nuclear technology. Information about the storage, use or handling of nuclear material or weapons is marked &quot;Formerly Restricted Data&quot;. These designations are used in addition to level markings (Confidential, Secret and Top Secret). Information protected by the Atomic Energy Act is protected by law and information classified under the Executive Order is protected by Executive privilege.

The U.S. government insists it is &quot;not appropriate&quot; for a court to question whether any document is legally classified. In the 1973 trial of Daniel Ellsberg for releasing the Pentagon Papers, the judge did not allow any testimony from Ellsberg, claiming it was &quot;irrelevant&quot;, because the assigned classification could not be challenged. The charges against Ellsberg were ultimately dismissed after it was revealed that the government had broken the law in secretly breaking into the office of Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist and in tapping his telephone without a warrant. Ellsberg insists that the legal situation in the U.S. in 2014 is worse than it was in 1973, and Edward Snowden could not get a fair trial. The State Secrets Protection Act of 2008 might have given judges the authority to review such questions in camera, but the bill was not passed.

When a government agency acquires classified information through covert means, or designates a program as classified, the agency asserts &quot;ownership&quot; of that information and considers any public availability of it to be a violation of their ownership — even if the same information was acquired independently through &quot;parallel reporting&quot; by the press or others. For example, although the CIA drone program has been widely discussed in public since the early 2000s, and reporters personally observed and reported on drone missile strikes, the CIA still considers the very existence of the program to be classified in its entirety, and any public discussion of it technically constitutes exposure of classified information. &quot;Parallel reporting&quot; was an issue in determining what constitutes &quot;classified&quot; information during the Hillary Clinton email controversy when Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Julia Frifield noted, &quot;When policy officials obtain information from open sources, &#x27;think tanks,&#x27; experts, foreign government officials, or others, the fact that some of the information may also have been available through intelligence channels does not mean that the information is necessarily classified.&quot;

===Table of equivalent classification markings in various countries===

==Corporate classification==
Private corporations often require written confidentiality agreements and conduct background checks on candidates for sensitive positions. In the U.S., the Employee Polygraph Protection Act prohibits private employers from requiring lie detector tests, but there are a few exceptions. Policies dictating methods for marking and safeguarding company-sensitive information (e.g. &quot;IBM Confidential&quot;) are common and some companies have more than one level. Such information is protected under trade secret laws. New product development teams are often sequestered and forbidden to share information about their efforts with un-cleared fellow employees, the original Apple Macintosh project being a famous example. Other activities, such as mergers and financial report preparation generally involve similar restrictions. However, corporate security generally lacks the elaborate hierarchical clearance and sensitivity structures and the harsh criminal sanctions that give government classification systems their particular tone.

==Traffic Light Protocol==
The Traffic Light Protocol was developed by the Group of Eight countries to enable the sharing of sensitive information between government agencies and corporations. This protocol has now been accepted as a model for trusted information exchange by over 30 other countries. The protocol provides for four &quot;information sharing levels&quot; for the handling of sensitive information.

<text>A security clearance is a status granted to individuals allowing them access to classified information (state or organizational secrets) or to restricted areas, after completion of a thorough background check. The term &quot;security clearance&quot; is also sometimes used in private organizations that have a formal process to vet employees for access to sensitive information. A clearance by itself is normally not sufficient to gain access; the organization must also determine that the cleared individual needs to know specific information. No individual is supposed to be granted automatic access to classified information solely because of rank, position, or a security clearance.

==Canada==

==United Kingdom==
===National Security Clearance types===
National Security Clearances are a hierarchy of levels, depending on the classification of materials that can be accessed—Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS), Counter-Terrorist Check (CTC), Enhanced Baseline Standard (EBS), Security Check (SC), enhanced Security Check (eSC), Developed Vetting (DV), enhanced Developed Vetting (eDV), and STRAP.

The BPSS is the entry-level National Security Clearance, and both CTC and EBS are effectively enhancements to the BPSS, with CTC relating to checking for susceptibility to extremist persuasion, and EBS relating to checking for susceptibility to espionage persuasion, the latter being needed for supervised access to SECRET material. The SC again is focused on susceptibility to espionage persuasion, and is required for an individual to have long-term unsupervised access to SECRET material and occasional access to TOP SECRET (TS) material, whilst for regular access to TS the DV, eDV is required. Occasionally STRAP is required with DV.

Those with National Security Clearance are commonly required to sign a statement to the effect that they agree to abide by the restrictions of the Official Secrets Act (OSA). This is popularly referred to as &quot;signing the Official Secrets Act&quot;. Signing this has no effect on which actions are legal, as the act is a law, not a contract, and individuals are bound by it whether or not they have signed it. Signing it is intended more as a reminder to the person that they are under such obligations. To this end, it is common to sign this statement both before and after a period of employment that involves access to secrets.

===National Security Clearance history===
After the United States entered into World War II, Britain changed its security classifications to match those of the U.S.. Previously, classifications had included the top classification &quot;Most Secret&quot;, but it soon became apparent that the United States did not fully understand the UK&#x27;s classifications, and classified information appeared in the U.S.&#x27;s press. This spearheaded the uniformity in classification between the United Kingdom and the United States. The terminology and levels of British security classifications have also changed from Positive Vetting and Enhanced Positive Vetting to SC, eSC, DV, eDV and STRAP.

===Other UK clearances===
In addition to National Security Clearances, other types of roles and organisations stipulate a need for clearances, including:
*Vulnerable Group Access (including children), as operated by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), replacing former Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) checks
*Law Enforcement, with a hierarchy of Police Personnel Vetting (PPV) and Non-Police Personnel Vetting (NPPV) levels.

==United States==
== United Nations ==

The UN has a Security Clearance (SC) procedure and document for United Nations staff travelling to areas designated as security phase areas, with numbers ranging from one to five (&quot;no-phase&quot; areas are calm countries where no SC is required).

United Nations staff can apply for SC online, at the website of the Department for Safety and Security.

== Individuals who have had security clearances revoked ==
In the post World War II era, there have been several highly publicized, and often controversial, cases of officials or scientists having their security clearances revoked, including:
This list does not cover people whose security clearance lapsed possibly following changing their job.

<doc id="252860" wikidata="Q3354766" url="?curid=252860" title="Operation Maple">
<text>During World War II, Operation Maple was a naval mine laying operation in support of the invasion of northern France (Operation Overlord). Operation Maple was part of Operation Neptune.

The objectives were stated as:

# To impede the movement of light enemy vessels stationed inside the Channel,
# To impede ingress into the Channel by enemy naval forces situated in the Atlantic and North Sea,
# To compel enemy naval forces moving toward the NEPTUNE area to follow a course to seaward of the extreme range of enemy shore batteries and shore based fighter cover, in order that allied surfaces forces would be free to intercept their progress,
# To disrupt enemy shipping generally during the critical period, in order to reduce seaborne movement of enemy reinforcements and supplies toward the battle area

The mines were laid by ships and aircraft, including , , 10th, 50th, 51st and 52nd M.L. Flotillas, and the 9th, 13th, 14th, 21st, 22nd and 64th M.T.B. Flotillas. In addition, mines were laid from the air by Halifax, Stirling and Lancaster bombers of numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 Groups, Bomber Command, Royal Air Force.

With the exception of the field laid in the Straits of Dover, and an area mined by aircraft to the north of the Frisian Islands, all the minefields were offensive in character. The two semi-defensive minefields, referred to above, were intended primarily to counter any movement of enemy heavier forces from the east. In April and May 1944, some of the mines laid were timed to become effective at various dates so as to escape being swept before the invasion of France.

During the course of Operation MAPLE, a total of 6,850 mines were laid. Of these, 42% were laid by naval forces in 66 operations and 58% were laid by aircraft in 1,800 sorties. These operations made an effective contribution to the general immunity from surface and U-boat attack enjoyed by the assault forces. A considerable number of casualties were inflicted on the enemy, and their minesweeping organization was stretched to the limit. Minefields in the vicinity of Ushant and off the Brittany coast had the desired effect of driving U-boats into open water, where they could be dealt with by allied anti-submarine forces. The special operation in the Kiel Canal resulted in a complete dislocation of the enemy organization at an important moment. The entire operation cost the allied cause, in casualties, only one Motor Torpedo Boat 2 and 19 minelaying aircraft.

A linked operation, &quot;Bravado&quot; laid mines in German waters, in and around the Kiel Canal. The objective was to disrupt German naval movements.

Three songs – &quot;Marcus Said&quot;, &quot;Underwhelmed&quot;, and &quot;Sugartune&quot; – were also included on the band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Smeared&quot;; &quot;Underwhelmed&quot; was entirely re-recorded, while &quot;Marcus Said&quot; and &quot;Sugartune&quot; were remixed versions of the original &quot;Peppermint&quot; recordings.

Jennifer Pierce of Jale provides additional backing vocals on two songs, &quot;Marcus Said&quot; and &quot;Torn&quot;.

The cover is a photo of Jason Larsen, a friend of the band&#x27;s, after whom the band is named. Larsen was originally called &quot;Slow One&quot; by his French-speaking boss, a nickname which, when said in the boss&#x27; French accent, sounded more like &quot;Sloan&quot;. Larsen agreed they could name the band after him as long as he was on the cover of their first album.

<text>Donau-Ries (&quot;Danube-Ries&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Ansbach, Weißenburg-Gunzenhausen, Eichstätt, Neuburg-Schrobenhausen, Aichach-Friedberg, Augsburg and Dillingen, and by the state of Baden-Württemberg (districts of Heidenheim and Ostalbkreis).

==History==
From Palaeolithic times on the Nördlinger Ries was a very attractive site for human settlement. The valley of the Danube was abounding with game, and many caves in the slopes of the crater provided shelter for Neanderthals and their successors.

The Ries was always densely populated. From 450 to 15 BC Celtic peoples built their settlements on the tops of the hills. Remains of Celtic circular forts and sanctuaries can be found all over the region. They were replaced about 90 AD by the Romans, who secured the region by building forts and the Limes (which was some km north of the present district).

The Romans were driven away about 250 AD by the Alamanni, which in turn were defeated by the Franks in 496. In the early years of the Holy Roman Empire new castles were erected, among them Schloss Oettingen, which was the centre of the county of Oettingen. This county was first mentioned in 1141, ruled over the villages of the Ries and managed to gain further territories around. In the 15th century the county was divided into the two states of Oettingen-Oettingen and Oettingen-Wallerstein. Later the former decided to become Protestant, while the latter remained Catholic. This was the reason for a bloody enmity resulting in decades of war. Even prior to the Thirty Years&#x27; War there were battles, mass executions and witchhunts in both parts. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War the Ries was almost completely devastated and depopulated. Two major battles of that war took place in the region: the Battle of Nördlingen (1634) and the Battle of Nördlingen (1645).

After the war, the Counts of the mini-states (in the meantime a third county called Oettingen-Spielberg had been founded) recruited settlers from Austria to repopulate the land. The hostilities between the counties were revived. There was fighting in the War of the Spanish Succession, with two major battles taking place in the Ries. All this came to an end, when the last Protestant ruler of Oettingen-Oettingen died without a successor. The remaining states of Oettingen-Wallerstein and Oettingen-Spielberg annexed his lands and turned them into a Catholic region.

In 1806 Napoleon dissolved both Oettingen states and awarded them to Bavaria. In the Congress of Vienna the affiliation of the region with Bavaria was confirmed, and the sovereignty of the Ries ended.

The present district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Nördlingen and Donauwörth.

==Geography==
In the south, the Danube crosses the district, running from west to east. It is joined by the Lech river coming from the south. North of the river there is a hill chain, the so-called Riesalb connecting the mountain chains of the Swabian Alb in the west and the Frankish Alb in the east. Further north there is the Nördlinger Ries, a huge depression, which is in fact an ancient impact crater, caused by a meteorite some 14.8 million years ago.

<text>Smeared is the debut studio album by Canadian rock band Sloan. It was released in Canada on October 1, 1992, and in the United States in January, 1993, on Geffen Records. The album was recorded at a low cost of $1,200. The album is ranked 86th in the 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot; by music journalist Bob Mersereau and is widely considered a seminal album of Canada&#x27;s 1990s alternative rock scene. In an interview with GuitarWorld, in December 2022, Patrick Pentland stated that a &quot;Smeared&quot; 30th Anniversary reissue is in the works, slated for 2023. The deluxe edition reissue was eventually released in May 2024, which featured a 44-page book, concert poster, unreleased demos &amp; outtakes from the &quot;Smeared&quot; sessions, as well as a previously unreleased live concert from June 1993 at McGill University, in Montreal.

==Overview==
Like their first release, the &quot;Peppermint EP&quot;, &quot;Smeared&quot; received comparisons to Sonic Youth and Beatles. Three songs from &quot;Peppermint&quot; re-appear on &quot;Smeared&quot;; one of these (&quot;Underwhelmed&quot;) was entirely re-recorded, while the other two (&quot;Marcus Said&quot; and &quot;Sugartune&quot;) are the same recordings with new mixing. The band had originally intended to name the album &quot;Gluegun&quot;.

The track Median Strip, despite being principally written by Andrew Scott, was sung by Chris Murphy. An alternate version featuring Scott&#x27;s vocals was included on the 2024 deluxe reissue.

Music videos were produced for the tracks &quot;Underwhelmed&quot;, &quot;500 Up&quot;, and &quot;Sugar Tune&quot;. The music video for &quot;Sugar Tune&quot; was shot in the Spring of 1993, in Iowa, while the band were on their United States tour of &quot;Smeared&quot;, and was shot by Super Friendz&#x27; Matt Murphy. This video went unreleased until December 2024. Two videos were shot for &quot;Underwhelmed&quot;. The first version of the video, shot by Colin MacKenzie, was shot in Clayton Park, in Halifax, NS, in June of 1992, at Chris&#x27; parents house. This version of the video, was the winner of the Moonsnail Award, in the Music Video category, at the Atlantic Film Festival, in 1992. Both &quot;Underwhelmed&quot; and &quot;500 Up&quot; received moderate rotation on MuchMusic in the early 1990s. Jennifer Pierce, of fellow Halifax band Jale, sang backing vocals on &quot;I Am the Cancer&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
By September 1993, the album had sold more than 150,000 copies worldwide. The album was certified Gold in Canada on July 12, 1995. By February 1997, the album had sold 60,000 units in Canada.

<doc id="252866" wikidata="Q852859" url="?curid=252866" title="Altered state of consciousness">
<text>An altered state of consciousness (ASC), also called an altered state of mind, altered mental status (AMS) or mind alteration, is any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state. It describes induced changes in one&#x27;s mental state, almost always temporary. A synonymous phrase is &quot;altered state of awareness&quot;.

== History ==
By 1892, the expression was in use in relation to hypnosis, though there is an ongoing debate as to whether hypnosis is to be identified as an ASC according to its modern definition. The next retrievable instance, by Max Mailhouse from his 1904 presentation to conference, however, is unequivocally identified as such, as it was in relation to epilepsy, and is still used today. In academia, the expression was used as early as 1966 by Arnold M. Ludwig and brought into common usage from 1969 by Charles Tart.

== Definitions ==
There is no general definition of an altered state of consciousness, as any definitional attempt would first have to rely on a definition of a normal state of consciousness. Attempts to define the term can however be found in philosophy, psychology and neuroscience. There is no final consensus on what the most accurate definition is. The best-established and latest definitions are provided below.

 attempted a first definition in 1966.

Starting from this, Charles Tart focuses his definition on the subjective experience of a state of consciousness and its deviation from a normal waking state.

Farthing&#x27;s definition of an altered state of consciousness (ASC) is based on Charles Tart&#x27;s terminology. Charles Tart described an altered state of consciousness as a profound change in the &quot;overall pattern of subjective experiences&quot;. In order to define an ASC, Tart focuses on the importance of subjective experience.

Farthing adds to his definition that an ASC is short-termed or at least reversible and that it might not even be recognized as an ASC at that moment. His definition relies only on subjective experience, leaving aside behavioral changes and physiological response.

He lists fourteen dimensions of changed subjective experience. To account for an ASC, multiple dimensions need to be altered.

A working definition for empirical research based on these previous definitions was by Schmidt in 2016:

== History ==
=== History of utilization of ASCs ===
Altered states of consciousness might have been employed by humans as early as 30,000 years ago. Mind-altering plants and/or excessive dancing were used to attain an ecstatic or mystic state. Examples of early religious use of altered states of consciousness are the rites of Dionysos and the Eleusinian Mysteries, as well as yoga and meditation. Followers of various shamanic traditions &quot;enter altered states of consciousness in order to serve their community.&quot; Terence McKenna has suggested that the use of psychedelic mushrooms in prehistoric times has led to the &quot;evolution of human language and symbol use&quot;. Some theorists propose that mind-altering substances, such as soma, might have pushed the formation of some of the world&#x27;s main religions.

Meditation in its various forms is being rediscovered by modern psychology because of its therapeutic potential and its ability to &quot;enable the activity of the mind to settle down&quot;. In psychotherapy, techniques like hypnosis and meditation support psychological processes.

=== History of scientific study ===

Due to the behaviourist paradigm in psychology altered states of consciousness were dismissed as a field of scientific inquiry during the early 20th century. They were pathologized and merely seen as symptoms of intoxication or demonic possession.

Their return into psychology began with Wiliam James&#x27; interest into a variety of altered states, such as &quot;mystical experiences and drug-induced states&quot;. James&#x27; investigations into first-person-subjective-experience contributed to the reconsideration of introspection as a valuable research method in the academic community.

The social change of the turbulent 1960s has decisively led to a change of the scientific perspective to the point that introspection as a scientific method and ASCs as valid realms of experience became more widely accepted. Foundations for the research have been laid out by various scientists such as Abraham Maslow, Walter N. Pahnke, Stanislav Grof and Charles Tart. They focused on seemingly beneficial aspects of ASCs such as their potential to &quot;promote creativity or treat addiction&quot;. Rather oppressive states such as dissociation from trauma were neglected.

The findings of the famous Good Friday Experiment by Pahnke suggest that mystical experiences can be triggered by psilocybin. Later investigations by Rick Doblin found that participants valued those experiences as &quot;spiritual high points of their lives&quot;.

In the midst of the rise of new-age subculture Stanislav Grof and others formed the new field of transpersonal psychology, which emphasized &quot;the importance of individual human experience, validity of mystical and spiritual experience, interconnectedness of self with others and the world and potential of self-transformation&quot;.

Abraham Maslow&#x27;s research on peak experiences, as moments of &quot;highest happiness and fulfillment&quot;, further contributed to the depathologization of altered states.

A first summary of the existing literature was carried out by Charles T. Tart in his book &quot;Altered States of Consciousness&quot;, which led to a more common use of the term. Tart coined the key terms &quot;discrete&quot; and &quot;baseline&quot; states of consciousness, and thought about a general classification system for ASCs. He also called for &quot;state specific sciences&quot; in which researchers should do science on ASCs from within such states.

== Classification ==
A classification of Altered States of Consciousness is helpful for comparing or differentiating induced ASCs and other variations of consciousness. Various researchers have attempted the classification into a broader framework. The attempts of classification discussed in the following focus on slightly different aspects of ASCs. Several authors suggested classification schemata with regard to the genesis of altered states and with regard to the type of experiences:

A classification with five categories was suggested by Dieter Vaitl to distinguish ASCs according to how they were induced:

* Pathological (Epilepsy, brain damage)
* Pharmacological (psychoactive substances)
* Physical and physiological (fasting and sex)
* Psychological (music, meditation, hypnosis)
* Spontaneous (day-dreaming and near death experience)

Vaitl further suggests four basic aspects of experiences: (1) activation (2) awareness span (3) self-awareness (4) sensory dynamics. Alternatively Roland Fischer suggests a classification along ergotropic (i.e., ecstasy) or trophotropic (i.e., meditation) properties. The work of Adolph Dittrich aimed to empirically determine common underlying dimensions of consciousness alterations induced by different methods, such as drugs or non-pharmacological methods. He suggested three basic dimensions, which were termed: (1) oceanic boundlessness (2) dread of ego dissolution (3) visionary restructuralization. Further, Ken Wilber proposes a multidimensional system and adds that the individual experience of an ASC is shaped by a person&#x27;s unique psychological development.

Michael Winkelman argues that there are four different &quot;modes of consciousness&quot;: (1) the waking mode (2) the deep sleep mode (3) the REM sleep / dreaming mode (4) the integrative mode. Within this framework, many ASCs (psychedelics, hypnosis, meditation, etc.) are defined as belonging to the integrative mode.

== Induction methods ==
=== Pharmacological ===
An altered state of consciousness may be defined as a short-term change in the general configuration of one&#x27;s individual experience, such that the rational functioning is clearly altered from one&#x27;s usual state of consciousness. There are many ways that one&#x27;s consciousness can be altered, such as by using psychoactive drugs, which are defined as chemical substances that pass through the blood-brain barrier and disturb brain function, causing changes in awareness, attitude, consciousness, and behavior.

Cannabis is a psychoactive drug that is known to alter the state of consciousness. Cannabis alters mental activity, memory, and pain perception. One who is under the influence of cannabis may experience degrees of paranoia, increased sensitivity, and delayed reactions not normal for their usual conscious state. A 2009 review of anxiety and cannabis studies concluded that &quot;frequent cannabis users appear to have higher levels of anxiety than non-users,&quot; and that &quot;a considerable number of subjects developed anxiety disorders before the first symptoms of cannabis dependence.&quot; That led researchers to believe that anxiety-prone people tend to use cannabis as a self-prescribed anxiety medicine, opposing the idea that cannabis is what&#x27;s causing the anxiety.

MDMA (ecstasy) is a drug that also alters one&#x27;s state of consciousness. The state of consciousness brought about by MDMA ingestion includes a rise in positive feelings and a reduction in negative feelings (Aldridge, D., &amp; Fachner, J. ö. 2005). Users&#x27; emotions are increased and inhibitions lowered, often accompanied by a sensation of intimacy or connection with other people.

Opioids are a class of drugs that alter consciousness. Examples of opioids include heroin, morphine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone. Opioids produce analgesia and often feelings of euphoria in users. Opioid abuse may result in decreased production of endorphins in the brain, natural pain relievers whose effects may be heightened by drugs.

Cocaine alters one&#x27;s state of consciousness. Cocaine affects the neurotransmitters that nerves use to communicate with each other. Cocaine inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters in the synapse, resulting in an altered state of consciousness or a &quot;high&quot; (Aldridge, D., &amp; Fachner, J. ö. 2005).

Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, activates serotonin receptors (the amine transmitter of nerve urges) in brain matter. LSD acts on certain serotonin receptors, and its effects are most prominent in the cerebral cortex, an area involved in attitude, thought, and insight, which obtains sensory signs from all parts of the body. LSD&#x27;s main effects are emotional and psychological. The ingester&#x27;s feelings may alter quickly through a range from fear to ecstasy (Humphrey, N. 2001). This may cause one to experience many levels of altered consciousness. It has also been shown to induce ego death (or &quot;ego dissolution&quot;).

Alcohol alters consciousness by shifting levels of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron (nerve cell) to another &quot;target&quot; cell (often another neuron). Neurotransmitters can cause inhibitory or excitatory effects on the &quot;target&quot; cell they are affecting. Alcohol increases the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) in the brain. GABA causes slow actions and inaudible verbal communication that often occur in alcoholics. Alcohol also decreases the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Suppressing this stimulant results in a similar type of physiological slowdown. In addition to increasing the GABA and decreasing the glutamate in the brain, alcohol increases the amount of the chemical dopamine in the brain, which is one of the addictive causes of alcoholism.

=== Non-pharmacological ===
Altered states of consciousness may also be induced by:

* Hypnosis
* Meditation
* Near-death experience

Emotions influence behavior that alters the state of consciousness. Emotions can be influenced by various stimuli.

=== Pathologies/other ===
Pathological or accidental induction may refer to unforeseen events or illnesses. According to Jeffrey R. Avner, professor of clinical pediatrics, a crucial element to understanding accidental and pathological causes of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) is that it begins with reduced self-awareness followed by reduced awareness in the environment (2006). Those with personal experience of conditions such as Depersonalisation often cite the opposite, that it is an increased awareness of the environment and the self that results in altered states of consciousness. When the reduction of self-awareness and environmental awareness take effect, they produce altered states of consciousness. The specific conditions below provide clarity on the types of conditions compromise accidental and pathological causes.

====Traumatic experience====
The first condition, traumatic experience, is defined as a lesion caused by an external force (Trauma. (n.d.) In Merriam-Webster Dictionary online, 2013). Examples include impact to the brain caused by blunt force (i.e., a car accident). The reason a traumatic experience causes altered states of consciousness is that it changes how the brain works. The external impact diverts the blood flow from the front of the brain to other areas. The front of the brain is known as the prefrontal cortex responsible for analytical thought (Kunsman, 2012). When the damage becomes uncontrollable, the patient experiences changes in behavior and impaired self-awareness. This is exactly when an altered state of consciousness is experienced.

====Epilepsy====
Another common cause of ASCs is epilepsy. According to Medlineplus epilepsy is as a brain disorder that causes seizures (2013). During the seizure, the patient will experience hallucinations and loss of mental control, causing temporary dissociation from reality. 
A study that was conducted with six epileptic patients and used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) detected how the patients did indeed experience hallucinations while a seizure is occurring. This not only altered the patient&#x27;s behavioral pattern but also made them dissociate from reality during that particular time frame.

====Oxygen deficiency====
Oxygen deficiency impacts the brain, which is why ASCs can occur when there is oxygen deprivation in an environment.

====Infections====
In addition to oxygen deprivation or deficiency, infections are a common pathological cause of ASC. A prime example of an infection is meningitis. The medical website WEBMD states that meningitis is an infection that causes the coverings of the brain to swell. This particular infection occurs in children and young adults. This infection is primarily viral. Viral meningitis causes ASC and its symptoms include fevers and seizures (2010). The Impairment becomes visible the moment seizures begin to occur, this is when the patient enters the altered state of consciousness.

====Sleep deprivation====
Sleep deprivation is also associated with ASCs, and can provoke seizures due to fatigue. Sleep deprivation can be chronic or short-term depending on the severity of the patient&#x27;s condition. Many patients report hallucinations because sleep deprivation impacts the brain. An MRI study conducted at Harvard Medical School in 2007 found that a sleep-deprived brain was not capable of being in control of its sensorimotor functions, leading to impaired self-awareness. Patients were also much clumsier than if they had not been experiencing sleep deprivation.

====Fasting====
Fasting is another form of deprivation. Fasting can be deliberate, including for religious reasons or from psychological conditions such as anorexia. Fasting refers to the ability to willingly refrain from food and possibly drinks as well. The dissociation caused by fasting is not only life-threatening but it is the reason why extended fasting periods can lead to ASC. Thus, the temporary dissociation from reality allows fasting to fall into the category of an ASC following the definition provided by Avner (2006).

====Psychosis====
Another pathological cause is psychosis, otherwise known as a psychotic episode. Psychotic episodes often include delusions, paranoia, derealization, depersonalization, and hallucinations (Revonsuo et al., 2008). Studies have not been able to clearly identify when a person is reaching a higher level of risk for a psychotic episode (Schimmelmann, B., Walger, P., &amp; Schultze-Lutter, F., 2013), but the earlier people are treated for psychosis the more likely they are to avoid the devastating consequences which could lead to a psychotic disorder (Schimmelmann, B., Walger, P., &amp; Schultze-Lutter, F., 2013). Unfortunately, there are very few studies which have thoroughly investigated psychotic episodes, and the ability to predict this disorder remains unclear. (Schimmelmann, B., Walger, P., &amp; Schultze-Lutter, F., 2013).

Reviewing the previous conditions for accidental and pathological causes, we can come to understand that all of these accidental or pathological causes share the component of reduced self-awareness. Therefore, ASCs cannot only be caused naturally but they can be induced intentionally with methods including hypnosis meditation, amongst others. There are also ASCs which are caused by less recreational purposes; people who utilize illegal substances, or heavy dosages of medications, as well as large amounts of alcohol, can indeed comply with the definition of an ASC (Revonsuo et al., 2008).

== Neurobiological models of altered state experiences ==
=== Entropic brain hypothesis ===

The entropic brain hypothesis by Robin Carhart-Harris in 2014 is a theory informed by neuroimaging research that uses the hallucinogen-induced neurological state to make inferences about other states of consciousness. The expression &quot;entropy&quot; is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, where high entropy means a high level of disorder. The theory proposes a general distinction between two fundamentally different modes of cognition, referred to as primary and secondary consciousness.

Primary consciousness is associated with unconstrained cognition and less ordered (higher-entropy) neurodynamics that preceded the development of modern, normal waking consciousness in adults. Examples include the rapid eye movement sleep (REM),transcendental state between REM sleep and sensory awareness(the psychedelic state), or the onset phase of psychosis.
Secondary consciousness is associated with constrained cognition and more ordered neurodynamics. Examples include normal waking consciousness, the anesthetized or the depressed state.

The theory further proposes that via pharmacological induction of psychedelic substances psilocybin, the brain is able to enter into the primary state of consciousness (the psychedelic state) from normal waking consciousness. This &quot;phase transition&quot; between these two fundamentally different poles of consciousness is facilitated by a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (MTLs), which are normally significantly coupled.
The DMN is closely associated with higher-order cognitive functions such as supporting the neurological basis for the self (e.g. self-reflection, subjectivity, introspection), thinking about others (e.g. theory of mind), remembering the past and thinking about the future (e.g. episodic memory). Task-positive networks are associated with the inverse of these things e.g., focus on and scrutiny of the external world.

The entropic brain hypothesis emphasizes the great research potential of the psychedelic state of mind for gaining more insight into general human consciousness.

=== CSTC-loop ===

Extensive scientific investigation on altered states of consciousness and their relationship to drug interactions with receptors in the brain have been performed. Particularly the study of the neurotransmitter serotonin and the effects of psychedelic drugs on the brain has been intensively researched over the past sixty years. It has been hypothesized that hallucinogens act either as an antagonist or an agonist at 5-HT2A (serotonin-2A) receptors and will elicit a state that shares some common phenomenological features with early acute stages of the group of schizophrenia disorders.

Findings implicate that abnormalities of serotonin function and the serotonergic system could be responsible for psychiatric disorders such as the spectrum of schizophrenia (gating) disorders and therefore, that serotonin agonist or antagonists might be useful in the treatment of disorders such as schizophrenia. To investigate the underlying causative neurotransmitter mechanisms of this phenomenon, the CSTC (cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical) loop model has been formulated based on empirical neurobiological work. It is indicated that the common hypofrontality (underactivation of frontal brain regions) and cortical activation pattern induced by serotonergic and glutamatergic hallucinogens is due to a common disruption of thalamic gating of sensory and cognitive information. The CSTC feedback loop plays a major role in gating or filtering out external and internal information to the cortex. Thereby it influences the regulation of the level of awareness and attention.

Disruption of the CSTC loop system is proposed to significantly influence information processing, for instance the ability to screen out, inhibit, filter, or gate extraneous stimuli and to direct selective attention to salient features of the environment. Failures of these attentional gating mechanisms might overload patients with the excessive processing of both sensory and cognitive stimuli, which could lead to a breakdown of cognitive integrity and difficulty in distinguishing self from non-self and failure to integrate an overwhelming flood of information. Descriptive elaboration of the mentioned effects can be found in the literature on schizophrenia as well as in descriptions of hallucinogenic drug action.

Despite strong evidence linking serotonin and psychosis, novel research indicates that some behavioral effects of drugs such as psilocybin appear to be independent of the classical 5-HT2A receptor-agonist actions, implying that the model described here is not the only underlying framework at play. Interdisciplinary research enterprises have set out to study the convergence of serotonergic and glutamatergic models of psychosis and dynamic neurotransmitter interactions, derived from the study of hallucinogenic drugs, in the future.

=== Synthetic surprise ===
Synthetic surprise is a theoretical concept explaining the altered states of consciousness induced by psychedelic substances like LSD and psilocybin. Central to this concept is the activation of the 5-HT2A receptor by psychedelics. The hypothesis suggests that these substances induce a state of synthetic surprise through the selective activation of the 5-HT receptors system, based on recent insights supporting a role of 5-HT in signaling surprise. This state aligns with the &#x27;prediction error&#x27; in the predictive coding framework of brain function, where there&#x27;s a discrepancy between the brain&#x27;s expectations and the actual sensory input. The precision of this sensory data is crucial in modifying the brain&#x27;s pre-existing beliefs or &#x27;priors&#x27;. Under the influence of psychedelics, the interplay between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory information is altered, leading to the characteristic changes in consciousness. Hallucinations in this context can be explained by the previously proposed &quot;Strong priors&quot; theory. This understanding of synthetic surprise has significant implications for the clinical use of psychedelic substances. The ability of psychedelics to induce surprise is proposed to be central to their therapeutic potential, especially in disrupting maladaptive cognitive and perceptual patterns.

<text>Jacques Tardi (; born 30 August 1946) is a French comic artist. He is often credited solely as Tardi.

==Biography==
Tardi was born on 30 August 1946 in Valence, Drôme. After graduating from the École nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon and the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs in Paris, he started drawing comics in 1969, at the age of 23, in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;, initially illustrating short stories written by Jean Giraud and Serge de Beketch, before creating the political fiction story &quot;Rumeur sur le Rouergue&quot; from a scenario by Pierre Christin in 1972.

In the English language, many of Tardi&#x27;s books are published by Fantagraphics Books, edited and translated by Fantagraphics&#x27; co-founder Kim Thompson.

In 2013, Tardi was nominated as a &quot;Chevalier&quot; in France&#x27;s Legion of Honour, the country&#x27;s highest distinction. However, he turned down the distinction, citing that he will &quot;remain a free man and not be held hostage by any power whatsoever.&quot;

<text>Twice Removed is the second album by Canadian rock band Sloan, released on Geffen Records in 1994. The album took seven weeks and cost $120,000 to record. More melodic than their previous album, &quot;Smeared&quot;, Geffen gave the record little promotion because it defied the label&#x27;s commercially dominant grunge rock style of the time. The band and Geffen parted ways after &quot;Twice Removed&quot;&#x27;s release. After the band&#x27;s trouble with the label, they took time off from touring and writing and were broken up for a brief period.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Twice Removed&quot; peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Albums Chart. By February 1997, the album had sold 58,000 units in Canada. The album was certified Gold in Canada on October 20, 1998. In the United States, the album has sold 14,000 units to date according to Nielsen Soundscan.

==Legacy==
In 1996, the music magazine &quot;Chart&quot; conducted a reader poll to determine the best Canadian albums of all time. &quot;Twice Removed&quot; topped that poll. When the magazine conducted a follow-up poll in 2000, &quot;Twice Removed&quot; lost the top spot to Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot;, but still placed third. In the third poll, in 2005, &quot;Twice Removed&quot; reclaimed the top spot.

It was also ranked fourteenth in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;.

In 2012, the album received a deluxe reissue on vinyl. This edition includes another three discs: one containing demo versions of the Twice Removed songs; another containing B-sides that were originally intended for the album but left off; and a 7-inch, 45 RPM disc containing songs that, in the words of guitarist Jay Ferguson, &quot;didn&#x27;t really fit anywhere else in the package&quot;. The release also includes a 12x12, 32-page colour booklet containing photos, interviews and other stories from the band&#x27;s members. The reissue was made available exclusively via the band&#x27;s website.

In 2015, the album was named the winner in the 1990s category of the inaugural Slaight Family Polaris Heritage Prize, an annual Canadian music award for classic albums released prior to the creation of the Polaris Music Prize.

*&quot;Penpals&quot; is referenced in the graphic novel &quot;Lost at Sea&quot; by Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley when one character sings the lyrics from it.

<doc id="252871" wikidata="Q915576" url="?curid=252871" title="List of monarchs of Moldavia">
<text>This is a list of monarchs of [[Moldavia]], from the first mention of the medieval polity east of the Carpathians and until its disestablishment in 1862, when it united with Wallachia, the other Danubian Principality, to form the modern-day state of Romania.

==Notes==

Dynastic rule is hard to ascribe, given the loose traditional definition of the ruling family (on principle, princes were chosen from any branch, including a previous monarch&#x27;s bastard sons – being defined as &quot;os de domn&quot; – &quot;of domn marrow&quot;, or as having &quot;hereghie&quot; – &quot;heredity&quot; (from the Latin &quot;hereditas&quot;); the institutions charged with the election, dominated by the boyars, had fluctuating degrees of influence). The system itself was challenged by usurpers, and became obsolete with the Phanariote epoch, when monarchs were appointed by the Ottoman Sultans. Between 1821 and 1862, various systems combining election and appointment were put in practice. Moldavian monarchs, like Wallachian and other Eastern European monarchs, bore the titles of &quot;Voivode&quot; or/and Hospodar (when writing in Romanian, the term Domn (from the Latin &quot;dominus&quot;) was used).

Most monarchs did not use the form of the name they are cited with, and several used more than one form of their own name; in some cases, the monarch was only mentioned in foreign sources. The full names are either modern versions or ones based on mentions in various chronicles.

The list is brought up to date for the first monarchs, following the documented studies of Ștefan S. Gorovei and Constantin Rezachevici.

==List==

=== Princes of Moldavia ===

====House of Dragoș====

====House of Bogdan-Mușat====

====House of Bogdan-Muşat, with interventions of Basarab (Drăculeşti line) and Movilești dynasties ====

=== Pre-Phanariote period===

The Ottoman influence in the Moldavian rulers&#x27; election grows from the mid-17th century onward. From 1659, the rulers elected are mostly scions of Greek families, and increasingly less linked to the original Moldavian ruling family. The process reached its peak with the called Phanariote period (1715-1859), where, between the rulers, there was already no connection (or a very distant one) with the dynasty of Bogdan-Musat.

====Various dynasties====

===Phanariotes (1711–1821)===
===Post-Phanariote period ===

<doc id="252876" wikidata="Q3352573" url="?curid=252876" title="One Chord to Another">
<text>One Chord to Another is the third studio album by the Canadian rock band Sloan. The album was released in Canada through Murderecords in 1996 and in the United States through The Enclave in 1997. Like their previous album, &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; is a Beatles-influenced power pop record.

&quot;One Chord to Another&quot; was the band&#x27;s first LP not to be released through Geffen Records. It was also the band&#x27;s first album to win a Juno Award.

==Recording==
Sloan began recording &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; in December, 1995. The album was recorded over a two-week period and cost $10,000 to make, $110,000 less than the cost of their previous album. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature trumpets.

==Reception==
===Commercial performance===
The album debuted at No. 15 on The Record&#x27;s Canadian Albums Chart. It was certified gold in Canada on November 21, 1996. By February 1997, the album had sold 80,000 units in Canada. It remains Sloan&#x27;s best-selling album.

===Critical acclaim===
The album won the award for Best Alternative Album at the 1997 Juno Awards. In a 2000 poll by music magazine &quot;Chart&quot;, &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; was voted the ninth greatest Canadian album of all time. It was also ranked 34th in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs credited to Sloan.

Note: Prior to the release of &quot;One Chord to Another&quot;, Sloan released &quot;Same Old Flame&quot; b/w &quot;Stood Up&quot; as a 7&quot; single on murderecords. These songs were re-recorded for the first pressing of &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; in Japan, released on EMI. While these versions of &quot;Stood Up&quot; are a Chris Murphy original, the song by the same name on &quot;Recorded &quot;Live&quot; at a Sloan Party!&quot; is a cover of a Matthew Grimson song.

==American and Japanese releases==
&quot;One Chord to Another&quot; was not released until 1997 in the United States on the independent label, The Enclave. It was originally released in an LP-style cardboard gatefold jacket rather than a traditional plastic jewel box, and included a 10-track bonus CD of material entitled Recorded Live at a Sloan Party! This bonus CD consisted of cover versions and re-recordings of previous Sloan songs; it was recorded in the studio but was overdubbed with miscellaneous party-type sounds to give the impression of being recorded live at an intimate gathering of friends (somewhat akin to the Beach Boys&#x27; Party! album). To date, the &quot;Sloan Party&quot; CD has not been released in the band&#x27;s native Canada and has only been available as an American import. In 2016, the &quot;Sloan Party&quot; album was released on vinyl as part of the 20th anniversary &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; box set, and featuring new album art reminiscent of the Beach Boys&#x27; Party! album.

Note: All of track 1 and the last 2:35 of track 10 consist of party sound effects only; track 8 is a cover of a song by Matthew Grimson, not the similarly-titled song released as a 1996 7&quot; single by Sloan. Track 2 is performed by Patrick Pentland and Jennifer Pierce; track 3 is performed by Chris Murphy; track 4 is performed by Andrew Scott; track 5 is performed by Jay Ferguson; track 6 is performed by Chris Murphy; track 7 is performed by Jay Ferguson; track 8 is performed by Chris Murphy; track 9 is performed by Jay Ferguson; track 10 is performed by Patrick Pentland.

&quot;One Chord to Another&quot; was Sloan&#x27;s first album to be released in Japan. They secured a distribution deal with EMI, who released the album with new recordings of &quot;Stood Up&quot; and &quot;Same Old Flame&quot;. When &quot;Navy Blues&quot; was released in Canada, however, Sloan&#x27;s distribution deal with Universal Canada led to new Japanese distribution with Universal Japan. Universal then released Sloan&#x27;s first three albums in Japan. The new Universal Japan version of &quot;One Chord to Another&quot; was a one-disc release featuring &quot;Recorded Live at a Sloan Party!&quot; as bonus tracks, making the original Japanese release on EMI, with its two exclusive tracks, a rarity in the Sloan catalogue.

<doc id="252881" wikidata="Q300879" url="?curid=252881" title="Operation Downfall">
<text>Operation Downfall was the proposed Allied plan for the invasion of the Japanese home islands near the end of World War II. The planned operation was canceled when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet declaration of war, and the invasion of Manchuria. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in November 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū, with the recently captured island of Okinawa to be used as a staging area. In early 1946 would come Operation Coronet, the planned invasion of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. Airbases on Kyūshū captured in Operation Olympic would allow land-based air support for Operation Coronet. If Downfall had taken place, it would have been the largest amphibious operation in history, surpassing D-Day.

Japan&#x27;s geography made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese as well; they were able to accurately predict the Allied invasion plans and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsugō , accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations. Casualty predictions varied but were extremely high, from the low hundreds of thousands to over a million on the Allied side and into the millions for the Japanese.

==Planning==

Responsibility for the planning of Operation Downfall fell to American commanders Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur and the Joint Chiefs of Staff—Fleet Admirals Ernest King and William D. Leahy, and Generals of the Army George Marshall and Hap Arnold (the latter being the commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces).

At the time, the development of the atomic bomb was a very closely guarded secret, known only to a few top officials outside the Manhattan Project (and to the Soviet espionage apparatus, which had managed to infiltrate or recruit agents within the program, despite the tight security around it), and the initial planning for the invasion of Japan did not take its existence into consideration. Once the atomic bomb became available, General Marshall envisioned using it to support the invasion if sufficient numbers could be produced in time.

The Pacific War was not under a single Allied commander-in-chief (C-in-C). Allied command was divided into regions: by 1945, for example, Chester Nimitz was the Allied C-in-C Pacific Ocean Areas, while Douglas MacArthur was Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area, and Admiral Louis Mountbatten was the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command. A unified command was deemed necessary for an invasion of Japan. Interservice rivalry over who it should be (the United States Navy wanted Nimitz, but the United States Army wanted MacArthur) was so serious that it threatened to derail planning. Ultimately, the Navy partially conceded, and MacArthur was to be given total command of all forces if circumstances made it necessary.

===Considerations===
The primary considerations that the planners had to deal with were time and casualties—how they could force Japan&#x27;s surrender as quickly as possible with as few Allied casualties as possible. Before the First Quebec Conference, a joint CanadianBritishAmerican planning team had produced a plan (&quot;Appreciation and Plan for the Defeat of Japan&quot;) which did not call for an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands until 1947–48. The American Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that prolonging the war to such an extent was dangerous for national morale. Instead, at the Quebec conference, the Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed that Japan should be forced to surrender not more than one year after Germany&#x27;s surrender.

The United States Navy urged the use of a blockade and airpower to bring about Japan&#x27;s capitulation. They proposed operations to capture airbases in nearby Shanghai, China, and Korea, which would give the United States Army Air Forces a series of forward airbases from which to bombard Japan into submission. The Army, on the other hand, argued that such a strategy could &quot;prolong the war indefinitely&quot; and expend lives needlessly, and therefore that an invasion was necessary. They supported mounting a large-scale thrust directly against the Japanese homeland, with none of the side operations that the Navy had suggested. Ultimately, the Army&#x27;s viewpoint prevailed.

Physically, Japan made an imposing target, distant from other landmasses and with very few beaches geographically suitable for sea-borne invasion. Only Kyūshū (the southernmost island of Japan) and the beaches of the Kantō Plain (both southwest and southeast of Tokyo) were realistic invasion zones. The Allies decided to launch a two-stage invasion. Operation Olympic would attack southern Kyūshū. Airbases would be established, which would give cover for Operation Coronet, the attack on Tokyo Bay.

===Assumptions===
While the geography of Japan was known, the U.S. military planners had to estimate the defending forces that they would face. Based on intelligence available early in 1945, their assumptions included the following:
* &quot;That operations in this area will be opposed not only by the available organized military forces of the Empire, but also by a fanatically hostile population.&quot;
* &quot;That approximately three (3) hostile divisions will be disposed in Southern Kyushu and an additional three (3) in Northern Kyushu at initiation of the Olympic operation.&quot;
* &quot;That total hostile forces committed against Kyushu operations will not exceed eight (8) to ten (10) divisions and that this level will be speedily attained.&quot;
* &quot;That approximately twenty-one (21) hostile divisions, including depot divisions, will be on Honshu at the initiation of [Coronet] and that fourteen (14) of these divisions may be employed in the Kanto Plain area.&quot;
* &quot;That the enemy may withdraw his land-based air forces to the Asiatic Mainland for protection from our neutralizing attacks. That under such circumstances he can possibly amass from 2,000 to 2,500 planes in that area by exercising a rigid economy, and that this force can operate against Kyushu landings by staging through homeland fields.&quot;

===Olympic===
Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyūshū, was to begin on &quot;X-Day&quot;, which was scheduled for November 1, 1945. The combined Allied naval armada would have been the largest ever assembled, including 42 aircraft carriers, 24 battleships, and 400 destroyers and destroyer escorts. Fourteen U.S. divisions and a &quot;division-equivalent&quot; (two regimental combat teams) were scheduled to take part in the initial landings. Using Okinawa as a staging base, the objective would have been to seize the southern portion of Kyūshū. This area would then be used as a further staging point to attack Honshu in Operation Coronet.

Olympic was also to include a deception plan, known as Operation Pastel. Pastel was designed to convince the Japanese that the Joint Chiefs had rejected the notion of a direct invasion and instead were going to attempt to encircle and bombard Japan. This would require capturing bases in Formosa, along the Chinese coast, and in the Yellow Sea area.

Tactical air support was to be the responsibility of the Fifth, Seventh, and Thirteenth Air Forces. These were responsible for attacking Japanese airfields and transportation arteries on Kyushu and Southern Honshu (e.g. the Kanmon Tunnel) and for gaining and maintaining air superiority over the beaches. The task of strategic bombing fell on the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific (USASTAF)—a formation which comprised the Eighth and Twentieth air forces, as well as the British Tiger Force. USASTAF and Tiger Force were to remain active through Operation Coronet. The Twentieth Air Force was to have continued its role as the main Allied strategic bomber force used against the Japanese home islands, operating from airfields in the Mariana Islands. Following the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, plans were also made to transfer some of the heavy bomber groups of the veteran Eighth Air Force to airbases on Okinawa to conduct strategic bombing raids in coordination with the Twentieth. The Eighth was to upgrade their B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators to B-29 Superfortresses (the group received its first B-29 on August 8, 1945). In total, General Henry Arnold estimated that the bomb tonnage dropped in the Pacific Theater by USAAF aircraft alone would exceed 1,050,000 tons in 1945 and 3,150,000 tons in 1946, excluding the blast yields of nuclear weapons.

Before the main invasion, the offshore islands of Tanegashima, Yakushima, and the Koshikijima Islands were to be taken, starting on X−5. The invasion of Okinawa had demonstrated the value of establishing secure anchorages close at hand, for ships not needed off the landing beaches and for ships damaged by air attack.

Kyūshū was to be invaded by the Sixth United States Army at three points: Miyazaki, Ariake, and Kushikino. If a clock were drawn on a map of Kyūshū, these points would roughly correspond to 4, 5, and 7 o&#x27;clock, respectively. The 35 landing beaches were all named for automobiles: Austin, Buick, Cadillac, and so on through to Stutz, Winton, and Zephyr. With one corps assigned to each landing, the invasion planners assumed that the Americans would outnumber the Japanese by roughly three to one. In early 1945, Miyazaki was virtually undefended, while Ariake, with its good nearby harbor, was heavily defended.

The invasion was not intended to conquer the entire island, just the southernmost third of it, as indicated by the dashed line on the map labeled &quot;general limit of northern advance&quot;. Southern Kyūshū would offer a staging ground and a valuable airbase for Operation Coronet.

After the name Operation Olympic was compromised by being sent out in unsecured code, the name Operation Majestic was adopted.

===Coronet===
Operation Coronet, the invasion of Honshu at the Kantō Plain south of the capital, was to begin on &quot;Y-Day&quot;, which was tentatively scheduled for March 1, 1946. Coronet would have been even larger than Olympic, with up to 45 U.S. divisions assigned for both the initial landing and follow-up (by comparison, the invasion of Normandy deployed twelve divisions in the initial landings). In the initial stage, the First Army would have invaded at Kujūkuri Beach, on the Bōsō Peninsula, while the Eighth Army invaded at Hiratsuka, on Sagami Bay; these armies would have comprised 25 divisions between them. Later, a follow-up force of up to twenty additional U.S. divisions and up to five or more British Commonwealth divisions would have landed as reinforcements. The Allied forces would then have driven north and inland, encircling Tokyo and pressing on toward Nagano.

===Redeployment===

Olympic was to be mounted with resources already present in the Pacific, including the British Pacific Fleet, a Commonwealth formation that included at least eighteen aircraft carriers (providing 25% of the Allied air power) and four battleships.

Tiger Force, a joint Commonwealth long-range heavy bomber unit, was to be transferred from RAF, RAAF, RCAF and RNZAF units and personnel serving with RAF Bomber Command in Europe. In 1944, early planning proposed a force of 500–1,000 aircraft, including units dedicated to aerial refueling. Planning was later scaled back to 22 squadrons and, by the time the war ended, to 10 squadrons: between 120 and 150 Avro Lancasters/Lincolns, operating out of airbases on Okinawa. Tiger Force was to have included the elite 617 Squadron, also known as &quot;The Dambusters&quot;, which carried out specialist bombing operations.

Initially, US planners also did not plan to use any non-US Allied ground forces in Operation Downfall. Had reinforcements been needed at an early stage of Olympic, they would have been diverted from US forces being assembled for Coronet—for which there was to be a massive redeployment of units from the US Army&#x27;s Southwest Pacific, China-Burma-India and European commands, among others. These would have included spearheads of the war in Europe such as the US First Army (15 divisions) and the Eighth Air Force. These redeployments would have been complicated by the simultaneous demobilization and replacement of highly experienced, time-served personnel, which would have drastically reduced the combat effectiveness of many units.

U.S. commanders rejected the Australian government’s early request for inclusion of an Australian Army infantry division in the first wave (Olympic). Not even the initial plans for Coronet envisaged landing units from Commonwealth or other Allied armies on the Kantō Plain in 1946. The first official &quot;plans indicated that assault, followup, and reserve units would all come from US forces&quot;.
By mid-1945—when plans for Coronet were being reworked—many other Allied countries had &quot;offered ground forces, and a debate developed&quot; amongst Western Allied political and military leaders, &quot;over the size, mission, equipment, and support of these contingents&quot;. Following negotiations, it was decided that Coronet would include a joint Commonwealth Corps, made up of infantry divisions from the Australian, New Zealand, British and Canadian armies. Reinforcements would have been available from those countries, as well as other parts of the Commonwealth. However, MacArthur blocked proposals to include an Indian Army division because of differences in language, organization, composition, equipment, training and doctrine. He also recommended that the corps be organized along the lines of a U.S. corps, should use only U.S. equipment and logistics, and should train in the U.S. for six months before deployment; these suggestions were accepted. 

The British Government suggested that: Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Keightley should command the Commonwealth Corps, a combined Commonwealth fleet should be led by Vice-Admiral Sir William Tennant, and that—as Commonwealth air units would be dominated by the RAAF – the Air Officer Commanding should be Australian. However, the Australian government questioned the appointment of Keightley, an officer with no experience in fighting the Japanese. Frederick Shedden suggested that Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, an Australian who had been carrying out the New Guinea and Borneo campaigns, should be appointed. The war ended before the details of the corps were finalized.

===Projected initial commitment===
Figures for Coronet exclude values for both the immediate strategic reserve of 3 divisions as well as the 17 division strategic reserve in the U.S. and any British/Commonwealth forces.

==Operation Ketsugō==


Meanwhile, the Japanese had their own plans. Initially, they were concerned about an invasion during the summer of 1945. However, the Battle of Okinawa went on for so long that they concluded the Allies would not be able to launch another operation before the typhoon season, during which the weather would be too risky for amphibious operations. Japanese intelligence predicted fairly closely where the invasion would take place: southern Kyūshū at Miyazaki, Ariake Bay and/or the Satsuma Peninsula.

While Japan no longer had a realistic prospect of winning the war, Japan&#x27;s leaders believed they could make the cost of invading and occupying the Home Islands too high for the Allies to accept, which would lead to some sort of armistice rather than total defeat. The Japanese plan for defeating the invasion was called (&quot;Operation: Decisive&quot; or &quot;Final Battle&quot;). The Japanese planned to commit the entire population of Japan to resisting the invasion, and from June 1945 onward, a propaganda campaign calling for &quot;The Glorious Death of One Hundred Million&quot; commenced. The main message of &quot;The Glorious Death of One Hundred Million&quot; campaign was that it was &quot;glorious to die for the holy emperor of Japan, and every Japanese man, woman, and child should die for the Emperor when the Allies arrived&quot;.

Although it was not realistic that the entire Japanese population would be killed off, both American and Japanese officers at the time predicted a Japanese death toll in the millions. From the Battle of Saipan onward, Japanese propaganda intensified the glory of patriotic death and depicted the Americans as merciless &quot;white devils.&quot; During the Battle of Okinawa, Japanese officers had ordered civilians unable to fight to commit suicide rather than fall into American hands, and all available evidence suggests the same orders would have been given in the home islands. The Japanese were secretly constructing an underground headquarters in Matsushiro, Nagano Prefecture, to shelter the Emperor and the Imperial General Staff during an invasion. In planning for Operation Ketsugo, IGHQ overestimated the strength of the invading forces: while the Allied invasion plan called for fewer than 70 divisions, the Japanese expected up to 90.

===&quot;Kamikaze&quot;===
Admiral Matome Ugaki was recalled to Japan in February 1945 and given command of the Fifth Air Fleet on Kyūshū. The Fifth Air Fleet was assigned the task of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks against ships involved in the invasion of Okinawa, Operation Ten-Go, and began training pilots and assembling aircraft for the defense of Kyūshū, the first invasion target.

The Japanese defense relied heavily on &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes. In addition to fighters and bombers, they reassigned almost all of their trainers for the mission. More than 10,000 aircraft were ready for use in July (with more by October), as well as hundreds of newly built small suicide boats to attack Allied ships offshore.

Up to 2,000 &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes launched attacks during the Battle of Okinawa, achieving approximately one hit per nine attacks. At Kyūshū, because of the more favorable circumstances (such as terrain that would reduce the Allies&#x27; radar advantage, and the impressment of wood and fabric airframe training aircraft into the &quot;kamikaze&quot; role which would have been difficult for Allied radar systems of the time to detect and track), they hoped to raise that to one for six by overwhelming the US defenses with large numbers of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks within a period of hours. The Japanese estimated that the planes would sink more than 400 ships; since they were training the pilots to target transports rather than carriers and destroyers, the casualties would be disproportionately greater than at Okinawa. One staff study estimated that the &quot;kamikazes&quot; could destroy a third to half of the invasion force before landing.

Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, was so concerned about losses from &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks that he and other senior naval officers argued for canceling Operation Downfall and for instead continuing the fire-bombing campaign against Japanese cities and the blockade of food and supplies until the Japanese surrendered. However, General Marshall argued that forcing surrender that way might take several years, if ever. Accordingly, Marshall and United States Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox concluded the Americans would have to invade Japan to end the war, regardless of casualties.

===Naval forces===
Despite the shattering damage it had absorbed by this stage of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy, by then organized under the Navy General Command, was determined to inflict as much damage on the Allies as possible. Remaining major warships numbered four battleships (all damaged), five damaged aircraft carriers, two cruisers, 23 destroyers, and 46 submarines. However, the IJN lacked enough fuel for further sorties by its capital ships and planned instead to use its anti-aircraft firepower to defend naval installations while docked in port. Despite its inability to conduct large-scale fleet operations, the IJN still maintained a fleet of thousands of warplanes and possessed nearly 2 million personnel in the Home Islands, ensuring it a large role in the coming defensive operation.

In addition, Japan had about 100 &quot;Kōryū&quot;-class midget submarines, 300 smaller &quot;Kairyū&quot;-class midget submarines, 120 &quot;Kaiten&quot; manned torpedoes, and 2,412 &quot;Shin&#x27;yō&quot; suicide motorboats. Unlike the larger ships, these, together with the destroyers and fleet submarines, were expected to see extensive action defending the shores, with a view to destroying about 60 Allied transports.

The Navy trained a unit of frogmen to serve as suicide bombers, the Fukuryu. They were to be armed with contact-fuzed mines, and to dive under landing craft and blow them up. An inventory of mines was anchored to the sea bottom off each potential invasion beach for their use by the suicide divers, with up to 10,000 mines planned. Some 1,200 suicide divers had been trained before the Japanese surrender.

===Ground forces===
The two defensive options against amphibious invasion are strong defense of the beaches and defense in depth. Early in the war (such as at Tarawa), the Japanese employed strong defenses on the beaches with little or no manpower in reserve, but this tactic proved vulnerable to pre-invasion shore bombardment. Later at Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, they switched strategies and dug in their forces in the most defensible terrain.

For the defense of Kyūshū, the Japanese took an intermediate posture, with the bulk of their defensive forces a few kilometers inland, back far enough to avoid complete exposure to naval bombardment, but close enough that the Americans could not establish a secure foothold before engaging them. The counteroffensive forces were still farther back, prepared to move against the largest landing.

In March 1945, there was only one combat division in Kyūshū. Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan, and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defense, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions. By August, the formations, including three tank brigades, had a total of 900,000 men. Although the Japanese were able to muster new soldiers, equipping them was more difficult. By August, the Japanese Army had the equivalent of 65 divisions in the homeland but only enough equipment for 40 and ammunition for 30.

The Japanese did not formally decide to stake everything on the outcome of the Battle of Kyūshū, but they concentrated their assets to such a degree that there would be little left in reserve. By one estimate, the forces in Kyūshū had 40% of all the ammunition in the Home Islands.

In addition, the Japanese had organized the Volunteer Fighting Corps, which included all healthy men aged 15 to 60 and women 17 to 40 for a total of 28 million people, for combat support and, later, combat jobs. Weapons, training and uniforms were generally lacking: many were armed with nothing better than antiquated firearms, molotov cocktails, longbows, swords, knives, bamboo or wooden spears, and even clubs and truncheons: they were expected to make do with what they had. One mobilized high school girl, Yukiko Kasai, found herself issued an awl and told, &quot;Even killing one American soldier will do. ... You must aim for the abdomen.&quot; They were expected to serve as a &quot;second defense line&quot; during the Allied invasion, and to conduct guerrilla warfare in urban areas and mountains.

The Japanese command intended to organize its Army personnel according to the following plan:

== Allied re-evaluation of Operation Olympic ==

===Air threat===
US military intelligence initially estimated the number of Japanese aircraft to be around 2,500. The Okinawa experience was bad for the US—almost two fatalities and a similar number wounded per sortie—and Kyūshū was likely to be worse. To attack the ships off Okinawa, Japanese planes had to fly long distances over open water; to attack the ships off Kyūshū, they could fly overland and then short distances out to the landing fleets. Gradually, intelligence learned that the Japanese were devoting all their aircraft to the &quot;kamikaze&quot; mission and taking effective measures to conserve them until the battle. An Army estimate in May was 3,391 planes; in June, 4,862; in August, 5,911. A July Navy estimate, abandoning any distinction between training and combat aircraft, was 8,750; in August, 10,290. By the time the war ended, the Japanese actually possessed some 12,700 aircraft in the Home Islands, roughly half &quot;kamikazes&quot;. &quot;Ketsu&quot; plans for Kyushu envisioned committing nearly 9,000 aircraft according to the following sequence:

* 140 reconnaissance planes to detect the approach of the Allied fleet.
* 330 Navy bombers flown by highly trained pilots to attack the Allied carrier task force to prevent it from supporting the invasion convoys.
* 50 &quot;land attack planes,&quot; 50 seaplane bombers, and 50 torpedo bombers flown by highly trained pilots for night attacks on convoy escorts.
* 825 Navy &quot;kamikazes&quot; to attack the landing convoys prior to their arrival off Kyūshū.
* 2,500 Army aircraft (conventional as well as suicide), together with 2,900 Naval trainers for &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks against the landing fleet as it arrived and anchored (5,400 total).
* 2,000 Army and Navy &quot;air superiority&quot; fighters to escort the &quot;kamikazes&quot; and strafe landing ships.
* 100 transport planes carrying 1,200 commandos for a raid on the US airbases on Okinawa, following the success of earlier smaller-scale operations.

The Japanese planned to commit the majority of their air forces to action within 10 days after the Allied fleet&#x27;s arrival off Kyūshū. They hoped that at least 15 to 20% (or even up to a half) of the US transport ships would be destroyed before disembarkation. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey subsequently estimated that if the Japanese managed 5,000 &quot;kamikaze&quot; sorties, they could have sunk around 90 ships and damaged another 900, roughly triple the Navy&#x27;s losses at Okinawa.

Allied counter-&quot;kamikaze&quot; preparations were known as the Big Blue Blanket. This involved adding more fighter squadrons to the carriers in place of torpedo and dive bombers, and converting B-17s into airborne radar pickets in a manner similar to present-day AWACS. Nimitz planned a pre-invasion feint, sending a fleet to the invasion beaches a couple of weeks before the real invasion, to lure out the Japanese on their one-way flights, who would then find ships bristling with anti-aircraft guns instead of the valuable, vulnerable transports.

The main defense against Japanese air attacks would have come from the massive fighter forces being assembled in the Ryukyu Islands. The US Army Fifth and Seventh Air Forces and US Marine air units had moved into the islands immediately after the invasion, and air strength had been increasing in preparation for the all-out assault on Japan. In preparation for the invasion, an air campaign against Japanese airfields and transportation arteries had commenced before the Japanese surrender.

===Ground threat===
Through April, May, and June, Allied intelligence followed the buildup of Japanese ground forces, including five divisions added to Kyūshū, with great interest, but also some complacency, still projecting that in November the total for Kyūshū would be about 350,000 servicemen. That changed in July, with the discovery of four new divisions and indications of more to come. By August, the count was up to 600,000, and Magic cryptanalysis had identified nine divisions in southern Kyūshū—three times the expected number and still a serious underestimate of the actual Japanese strength.

Estimated troop strength in early July was 350,000, rising to 545,000 in early August.

By the time of surrender, the Japanese had over 735,000 military personnel either in position or in various stages of deployment on Kyushu alone. The total strength of the Japanese military in the Home Islands amounted to 4,335,500, of whom 2,372,700 were in the Army and 1,962,800 in the Navy. The buildup of Japanese troops on Kyūshū led American war planners, most importantly General George Marshall, to consider drastic changes to Olympic, or replacing it with a different invasion plan.

===Chemical weapons===
Fears of &quot;an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other&quot; encouraged the Allies to consider unconventional weapons, including chemical warfare. Widespread chemical warfare was considered against Japan&#x27;s population and food crops. While large quantities of gas munitions were manufactured and plans were drawn, it is unlikely they would have been used. Richard B. Frank states that when the proposal reached Truman in June 1945, he vetoed the use of chemical weapons against personnel; their use against crops, however, remained under consideration. According to Edward J. Drea, the strategic use of chemical weapons on a massive scale was not seriously studied or proposed by any senior American leader; rather, they debated the &quot;tactical&quot; use of chemical weapons against pockets of Japanese resistance.

Although chemical warfare had been outlawed by the Geneva Protocol, neither the United States nor Japan was a signatory at the time. While the US had promised never to initiate gas warfare, Japan had used gas against the Chinese earlier in the war:

In addition to use against people, the U.S. military considered chemical attacks to kill crops in an attempt to starve the Japanese into submission. The Army began experimenting with compounds to destroy crops in April 1944, and within one year had narrowed over 1,000 agents to nine promising ones containing phenoxyacetic acids. One compound designated LN-8 performed best in tests and went into mass production. Dropping or spraying the herbicide was deemed most effective; a July 1945 test from an SPD Mark 2 bomb, originally crafted to hold biological weapons like anthrax or ricin, had the shell burst open in the air to scatter the chemical agent. By the time the war ended, the Army was still trying to determine the optimal dispersal height to cover a wide enough area. The ingredients in LN-8 and another tested compound would later be used to create Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam War.

===Nuclear weapons===
On Marshall&#x27;s orders, Major General John E. Hull looked into the tactical use of nuclear weapons for the invasion of the Japanese home islands, even after the dropping of two strategic atomic bombs on Japan (Marshall did not think that the Japanese would capitulate immediately). Colonel Lyle E. Seeman reported that at least seven Fat Man-type plutonium implosion bombs would be available by X-Day, which could be dropped on defending forces. Seeman advised that American troops not enter an area hit by a bomb for &quot;at least 48 hours&quot;; the risk of nuclear fallout was not well understood, and such a short time after detonation would have exposed American troops to substantial radiation.

Ken Nichols, the District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, wrote that at the beginning of August 1945, &quot;[p]lanning for the invasion of the main Japanese home islands had reached its final stages, and if the landings actually took place, we might supply about fifteen atomic bombs to support the troops.&quot; An air burst above the ground had been chosen for the (Hiroshima) bomb to achieve maximum blast effects, and to minimize residual radiation on the ground, as it was hoped that American troops would soon occupy the city.

===Alternative targets===
The Joint Staff planners, taking note of the extent to which the Japanese had concentrated on Kyūshū at the expense of the rest of Japan, considered alternate places to invade such as the island of Shikoku, northern Honshu at Sendai, or Ominato. They also considered skipping the preliminary invasion and going directly at Tokyo. Attacking northern Honshu would have the advantage of a much weaker defense but had the disadvantage of giving up land-based air support (except the B-29s) from Okinawa.

===Prospects for Olympic===
MacArthur dismissed any need to change his plans:

However, King was prepared to oppose proceeding with the invasion, with Nimitz&#x27;s concurrence, which would have set off a major dispute within the US government:

===Soviet intentions===


Unknown to the Americans, the Soviet Union also considered invading a major Japanese island, Hokkaido, by the end of August 1945, which would have put pressure on the Allies to act sooner than November.

In the early years of World War II, the Soviets had planned on building a huge navy to catch up with the Western world. However, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 forced the suspension of this plan: the Soviets had to divert most of their resources to fighting the Germans and their allies, primarily on land, throughout most of the war, leaving their navy relatively poorly equipped. As a result, in Project Hula (1945), the United States transferred about 100 naval vessels out of the 180 planned to the Soviet Union in preparation for the planned Soviet entry into the war against Japan. The transferred vessels included amphibious assault ships.

At the Yalta Conference (February 1945), the Allies had agreed that the Soviet Union would take the southern part of the island of Sakhalin, which Japan had invaded during the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, and which Russia had ceded in the Treaty of Portsmouth after the war (the Soviets already controlled the northern part), and the Kuril Islands, which had been assigned to Japan in the 1875 Treaty of St. Petersburg. On the other hand, no agreement envisaged Soviet participation in the invasion of Japan itself.

The Japanese had &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft in southern Honshu and Kyushu which would have opposed operations Olympic and Coronet. It is unknown to what extent they could have opposed Soviet landings in the far north of Japan. For comparative purposes, about 1,300 Western Allied ships deployed during the Battle of Okinawa (April–June 1945). In total, 368 ships, including 120 amphibious craft, were badly damaged, and another 28, including 15 landing ships and 12 destroyers, were sunk, mostly by &quot;kamikazes&quot;. The Soviets, however, had fewer than 400 ships, most of them not equipped for amphibious assault, when they declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945.

For Operation Downfall, the US military envisaged requiring more than 30 divisions for a successful invasion of the Japanese home islands. In comparison, the Soviet Union had about 11 divisions available, comparable to the 14 divisions the US estimated that it would require to invade southern Kyushu. The Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands (August 18 – September 1, 1945) took place after Japan&#x27;s capitulation on August 15. However, the Japanese forces in those islands resisted quite fiercely although some of them proved unwilling to fight after Japan&#x27;s surrender on August 15. In the Battle of Shumshu (August 18–23, 1945), the Soviet Red Army had 8,821 troops that were not supported by tanks and without back-up from larger warships. The well-established Japanese garrison had 8,500 troops and fielded about 77 tanks. The battle lasted one day, with minor combat actions going on for four more after the official surrender of Japan and the garrison, during which the attacking Soviet forces lost over 516 troops and five of the 16 landing ships (many of these formerly belonged to the US Navy and were later given to the Soviet Union) to Japanese coastal artillery, and the Japanese lost over 256 troops. According to Soviet claims, Soviet casualties during the Battle of Shumshu totaled up to 1,567, and the Japanese suffered 1,018 casualties.

During World War II, the Japanese had a naval base at Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands and several bases in Hokkaido. Since Japan and the Soviet Union maintained a state of wary neutrality until the Soviet declaration of war on Japan in August 1945, Japanese observers based in Japanese-held territories in Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands constantly watched the port of Vladivostok and other seaports in the Soviet Union.

According to Thomas B. Allen and Norman Polmar, the Soviets had carefully drawn up detailed plans for the Far East invasions, except that the landing for Hokkaido &quot;existed in detail&quot; only in Stalin&#x27;s mind and that it was &quot;unlikely that Stalin had interests in taking Manchuria and even taking on Hokkaido. Even if he wanted to grab as much territory in Asia as possible, he was too much focused on establishing a beachhead in Europe more so than Asia.&quot;

==Estimated casualties==
Due to the nature of combat in the Pacific Theater and the characteristics of the Japanese Armed Forces, it was accepted that a direct invasion of mainland Japan would be very difficult and costly. The Allies would not only have to contend with all available Japanese military forces that could be brought to bear, but also the resistance of a &quot;fanatically hostile population.&quot; Depending on the scope and context, casualty estimates for American forces ranged from 220,000 to several million, and estimates of Japanese military and civilian casualties ran from the millions to the tens of millions. Casualty estimates did not include potential losses from radiation poisoning resulting from the tactical use of nuclear weapons or from Allied POWs who would have been executed by the Japanese.

In the aftermath of the Marianas Campaign, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) revised their planning document, &quot;Operations against Japan subsequent to Formosa&quot; (JCS 924), to reflect the experience gained. Taking into account the stiff resistance of the Japanese 31st Army at Saipan, they concluded that if U.S. forces had to defeat all 3.5 million Japanese soldiers who could be made available, &quot;it might cost us half a million American lives and many times that number wounded.&quot; Despite the high numbers, by the spring of 1945 a figure of 500,000 battle casualties for the projected invasion was widely used in briefings, while totals of closer to a million were used for actual planning purposes. U.S. planners hoped that by seizing a few vital strategic areas they could establish &quot;effective military control&quot; over Japan without the need to clear the entire archipelago or defeat the Japanese on mainland Asia, thereby avoiding excessive losses.

Covering only the U.S. Army, the Army Service Forces (ASF) planning document of January 15, 1945, &quot;Redeployment of the United States Army after the Defeat of Germany,&quot; expected that an average of 43,000 replacements for &quot;dead and evacuated wounded&quot; would be needed each month between June 1945 and December 1946 to carry out the final phase of the war against Japan. Projected losses in these categories, excluding those of the Navy and Marine Corps, totaled approximately 723,000 through the end of 1946 and 863,000 through the first part of 1947.


Two days later on January 17, letters from President Roosevelt, General Marshall, and Admiral King to House Military Affairs Committee Chairman Andrew J. May were released to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, informing the public that &quot;the Army must provide 600,000 replacements for overseas theaters before June 30, and, together with the Navy, will require a total of 900,000 inductions by June 30.&quot; Of the Navy&#x27;s target of 300,000, a large proportion were required for &quot;manning the rapidly expanding fleet&quot; rather than replacing battle casualties.

Acting on the basis of sensitive information obtained from contacts in the military, former President Herbert Hoover, a close personal friend of incoming President Harry S. Truman, submitted a memorandum on May 15, 1945, to Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Hoover&#x27;s memorandum indicated that defeating Japan could cost 500,000 to 1 million American dead. The same week, Kyle Palmer, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; war correspondent at Admiral Nimitz&#x27;s headquarters, warned that &quot;it will cost 500,000 to 750,000, perhaps 1,000,000 lives of American boys to end this war.&quot; Those numbers were given in the context of revised estimates of Japanese military strength, still classified, which indicated that the Japanese Army had the potential to mobilize 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 soldiers rather than the 3.5 million assessed by JCS 924.

On May 28, Hoover and Truman met at the White House and conversed for several hours. At Truman&#x27;s request Hoover prepared four memoranda on the issues discussed (1. The European Food Organization, 2. The Domestic Food Organization, 3. The Creation of a War Economic Council, and 4. The Japanese Situation—in which Hoover twice repeated his figure of 500,000 to 1 million American deaths). Truman &quot;seized&quot; on memo 4 and asked for written judgements on it from Stimson, Undersecretary of State Joseph Grew, Director of the Office of Mobilization and Reconversion Fred Vinson, and former Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Truman was particularly interested in hearing from Grew and Stimson and asked to meet with them in person.

Neither Hull nor Grew objected to Hoover&#x27;s estimate, but Stimson forwarded his copy of &quot;Memo 4&quot; to Marshall&#x27;s deputy Chief of Staff, General Thomas T. Handy. As with the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario from JCS 924, Handy wrote that &quot;under our present plan of campaign&quot; (emphasis original), &quot;the estimated loss of 500,000 lives [...] is considered to be entirely too high.&quot; Both Marshall and General George A. Lincoln, chief of the Operations Division (OPD), agreed with Handy&#x27;s remarks. Nonetheless, it was emphasized that an invasion would cost &quot;a lot of lives.&quot;

Appalled at the prospect of an impending bloodbath, Truman ordered a meeting scheduled for June 18, 1945, involving the JCS, Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. At stake was the decision to press forward with Downfall or to opt for the Navy&#x27;s long-standing proposal of blockade and bombardment. To support the meeting, the Joint War Plans Committee (JWPC) hastily assembled a table illustrating the casualties that could be expected in an invasion of Japan based on the experience of the Battle of Leyte. That estimate, which was significantly lower than those that had been made previously, was deleted from a subsequent version of the document and not shown to the President. The meeting concluded with all participants agreeing that the invasion would be &quot;bloody but essential for victory.&quot; Truman expressed hope of avoiding &quot;an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other.&quot;
Throughout the summer, as the intelligence picture concerning Japanese Army strength in the Home Islands became more and more unfavorable, together with new data from the fighting on Iwo Jima and Okinawa, casualty predictions were continually revised upward. During the first week of August, approximately 50 reporters from the United States, Britain, and Australia were given an &quot;off the record&quot; briefing at General MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters in Manila, where they were informed that final operations against Japan could result in up to 1 million American casualties. An internal memorandum from Marshall to Leahy implied that by June 30, 1946, there would be approximately 275,000 Army soldiers in serious enough condition to require hospitalization in the United States. That excluded the dead and missing; losses of other branches; patients previously discharged and sent back to their units or invalidated from service; and patients in forward hospitals in Hawai&#x27;i, the Philippines, Australia, Kyushu, and elsewhere. The number of beds to be made available in such forward hospitals was planned to total about 150,000, a general rule being that available beds should exceed expected casualties (excluding deaths) by 20%. By war&#x27;s end nearly half a million Purple Heart medals were on hand with more being produced in anticipation of the invasion; in 2003 there were still some 120,000 of this stockpile left.

Writing in &quot;Military Review: June 1946&quot; No. 3, MacArthur&#x27;s intelligence chief, Major General Charles A. Willoughby, concluded that destroying &quot;two to two and a half Japanese divisions [exacts] a total of 40,000 American battle casualties on land.&quot; Using that &quot;sinister ratio,&quot; he claimed that U.S. forces could have expected over 700,000 casualties at four key locations in mainland Japan. The estimate excluded losses from &quot;the shattering kamikaze attack,&quot; combat against Naval ground forces personnel and militia, and any reinforcements the Japanese might have been able to bring in to the battle areas. Willoughby regarded that ratio as &quot;a completely authentic yardstick to forecast what it would have taken in losses had we gone in shooting.&quot; 

==POW executions==
In addition to battle casualties, hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war and civilian internees were also scheduled to be murdered by the Japanese. Beginning in the summer of 1944, Japanese leaders issued a series of directives to prison camp commandants that all prisoners were to be &quot;liquidated&quot; when Allied troops approached the camps. The objective was to prevent the prisoners from rioting or being utilized as a fighting force, and camp commandants were given flexibility as to how the &quot;liquidation&quot; would be accomplished. The main emphasis was to &#x27;annihilate all captives, not allowing a single one to escape,&#x27; and that &#x27;no trace&#x27; should be left of their existence or the existence of the prison camps. At the end of the war many POWs were in the process of digging their own graves in preparation for their deaths.

Historically, the orders led to the massacre of POWs on several occasions, including on Palawan Island, in which men were burned alive in their barracks, shot, or stabbed. The Palawan massacre prompted American forces to organize daring rescue missions to save other prisoners from execution, such as the &quot;Great Raid&quot; on Cabanatuan. On August 20, 1945, the Japanese government secretly distributed an order formally authorizing guards and other perpetrators to flee to escape punishment for their crimes.
==Japanese casualties==
Throughout the Pacific War, the Imperial Japanese Army earned a reputation of fighting practically to the last man. By the early summer of 1945, there had not been one instance of an organized surrender by any Japanese unit, even under the most hopeless conditions. The Japanese suffered especially from starvation and disease: according to historian Akira Fujiwara, out of 2.3 million military deaths between 1937 and 1945, 1.4 million (61%) were attributable to these causes. A further 358,000 (15.5%) died from drowning as a result of the American air and submarine campaign against Japanese shipping. During the reconquest of the Philippines as many as 80% of Japanese deaths were from starvation and disease, while the proportion in New Guinea may have reached 97%. Even in battles where starvation was not as great of a factor, Japanese losses were skewed higher because their island garrisons had no means of resupply or evacuation. Former Ensign Kiyoshi Endo, an Iwo Jima survivor, later recalled: &quot;The number of deaths on the Japanese side was much larger, because the Americans rescued and treated their injured. Japanese soldiers who were injured could have survived if they were rescued, but that was not possible, so they all died.&quot;

In contrast to previous campaigns, Admiral King pointed out that the Japanese Army in the Home Islands would have several advantages that its overseas counterparts did not. It would have more &quot;room to maneuver, and would not be so vulnerable to the overpowering air and naval power which the Allies had been able to bring to bear [...] on small and isolated islands.&quot; It would also be near to its bases of supply and reinforcement, and have the support of a friendly population. For these reasons Admiral King was cautious about using casualty rates from previous battles to predict the course of fighting in Japan.

Under the Ketsu-Go (結語, &quot;conclusion&quot;) plan, all divisions assigned to coastal defense were ordered to stand and fight &quot;even to utter annihilation,&quot; and heavy counterattacks by reserves aimed to force a decisive battle near the beachheads. If that had failed, the surviving mobile elements would have retreated to strongholds around Mount Aso on Kyushu and in Nagano Prefecture on Honshu for protracted resistance. Given their chosen tactics, American military historian Richard B. Frank concluded that &quot;it is hard to imagine that fewer than [40 to 50%]&quot; of Japanese soldiers and sailors in the invasion areas &quot;would have fallen by the end of the campaign.&quot;

Civilian casualties were also expected to be high, both as a direct result of military action and indirectly from other causes. Between 10 and 25% of the civilian population of Okinawa died as a result of the battle there. A worst-case scenario, published on July 21, 1945, by the physicist William B. Shockley, predicted that &quot;at least&quot; 5 to 10 million Japanese – military and civilians – could die, with a corresponding American casualty total of up to 4 million. The war ended before this document, &quot;Proposal for Increasing the Scope of Casualties Studies,&quot; could be considered in detail. Army Service Forces planners assessed that approximately one third of Japanese civilians within the invasion areas on Kyushu and Honshu would flee as refugees or die, leaving the remainder (including wounded and sick) to be cared for by the occupation authorities.

Japanese leaders regarded Ketsu-Go as apocalyptic battle in which they would either succeed or be destroyed as a nation. Propagandists frequently repeated the slogan that &#x27;all 100 million people of the Empire should be prepared to sacrifice themselves,&#x27; and that even if they failed, &quot;the memory of Japan will be inscribed in history forever.&quot;

Internally, it was believed that while the whole people would not be annihilated, losses would be heavy. In a August 13 meeting with Army Chief of Staff Umezu, Chief of the Naval General Staff Toyoda, and Foreign Minister Togo, Admiral Takijiro Onishi stated, &quot;If we are prepared to sacrifice 20 million Japanese lives in a special attack effort, victory shall be ours!&quot; Later Marquis Koichi Kido also gave the figure of 20 million to an interrogator for the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, but in reference to total casualties instead of deaths. Lt. Col. Masahiko Takeshita, a staff officer at the War Ministry and brother in law of War Minister Korechika Anami, testified that:

&quot;We did not believe that the entire people would be completely annihilated through fighting to the finish. Even if a crucial battle were fought in the homeland and the Imperial Forces were confined to the mountainous regions, the number of Japanese killed by enemy forces would be small. Despite the constant victories of Japanese troops in the China Incident, relatively few Chinese were killed. Almost all the strategic points in China were occupied, but the Chungking Government could not be defeated. [But] even if the whole [Japanese] race were all but wiped out, its determination to preserve the national polity would be forever recorded in the annals of history.&quot;

As a result of the American naval blockade and strategic bombing campaign, the food situation in Japan had become difficult. By the end of the war the average person consumed 10 to 25% fewer calories than in 1941, and this amount was declining. In January 1946, future Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida warned that unless emergency food aid was rushed to Japan, up to 10 million people could starve to death by the end of 1946. Other estimates, including those of agricultural experts working under MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters, ranged from 7 million to 11 million.

&quot;Note: final personnel figure of 815,548 derived from earlier documentation; includes approximately 90,000 men (11th Airborne Division and 81,000 others) who will be transferred to Honshu.&quot;
&quot;Although the Japanese Navy had more than 1 million personnel in the Home Islands by August 1945, less than 100,000 were actually organized into ground combat units. Ground forces were disposed as above, to be placed under tactical command of the Army during combat operations.&quot;

<text>Edwinstowe is a village and civil parish in the Newark and Sherwood district of Nottinghamshire, England, on the edge of Sherwood Forest and the Dukeries. It is associated with the legends of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, and to a lesser extent Edwin of Northumbria, from where the village gets its name. The civil parish population at the 2011 census was 5,188. A 2019 estimate put it at 5,261, and was 5,320 at the 2021 census.

==Heritage==
The etymology of the village name, &quot;Edwin&#x27;s resting place&quot;, recalls that the body of Edwin of Northumbria, King and Saint, was hidden in the church after he was killed in the Battle of Hatfield Chase. The battle against King Penda of Mercia is thought to have occurred near the present-day hamlet of Cuckney, some five miles north-west of modern Edwinstowe, though this location is disputed. 

Like Thoresby, Budby and Mansfield, Edwinstowe belonged to King Edward the Confessor and afterwards became the property of King William the Conqueror.

Edwinstowe is referred to twice in Domesday Book as having five households, in addition to a priest and his four bordars, in 1086.

Legend has it that Robin Hood married Maid Marian in St Mary&#x27;s Church. Edwinstowe is known for the presence near the village of the Major Oak in Sherwood Forest, a feature in the folk tales of Robin Hood, and Robin Hood&#x27;s Larder.

By the turn of the 20th century Edwinstowe consisted of a cluster of houses along Town Street, East Lane, Church Street and High Street. A hamlet called Hazel Grove was bordered by Mill Lane and the railway line and a cluster of houses at the top of Rufford Road was another hamlet called Lidgett. Lidgett was the site of a fireworks factory owned by F. Tudsbury and Co. before George Pinder, a local wine, spirit and porter merchant who resided at Lidgett House, took over ownership by 1886. These settlements eventually merged as the result of infills from World War I, much of it housing for colliers and named after the largest area.

==Economy==

Nottinghamshire County Council&#x27;s Sherwood Forest Visitors&#x27; Centre is located near the village and was redeveloped and improved in 2017 at a cost of £5.3 million. This centre is operated in partnership by the Council and the RSPB. 

Center Parcs&#x27; Sherwood Forest holiday village is a local employer established in 1987, close to the edge of the village.
Sherwood Pines Forest Park is set within Sherwood Forest near to Old Clipstone and has activity walking/cycling trails, play areas and bike hire for the general public. Sherwood Pines is managed by the Forestry Commission. A Go Ape adventure area is on-site too.

There was a post windmill south of the Mansfield Road with a small box-style roundhouse. It was driven by two common and two double-patent windmill sails.

Thoresby Colliery served as Edwinstowe&#x27;s main source of employment until July 2015, when the mine was permanently closed. The loss of one of the last remaining deep coal mines in the country has left tourism as the main factor in the local economy. The colliery has now become a large housing development for 800 homes, to make use of the now brownfield site.

==Amenities==

The two schools in the village are St Mary&#x27;s Primary School and King Edwin Primary School. The former Rufford School on the north side of the village closed in 2003 and has become residential housing by Barratt Developments, known as Friars Park. A skate park on the development proved controversial with concerns over noise and anti-social behaviour.

The village has a business services provider, a St John&#x27;s Ambulance amenity, an antiques centre, workshops, a fun park, a youth hostel, two arts and crafts centres, a village hall, and a community pest-control centre. Leisure facilities include Thoresby Colliery Band and Youth Band, a high-wire forest adventure course, a mountain biking, cyclo cross and forest walks centre, a forest fun park, and an outdoor adventure park.

Environmental concerns are addressed under the Maun Valley Project Conservation Area.

==Transport==
Edwinstowe railway station functioned between 1897 and 1955. A goods line remains. The nearest passenger railway stations are at Mansfield Woodhouse and Mansfield, both about from Edwinstowe.

The village is served by half-hourly daytime Monday–Saturday bus services to Mansfield and Ollerton, six buses a day Monday–Saturday to Worksop, and one bus a day Monday–Friday to Nottingham. Services run twice a week to Newark and once a week to Lincoln.

<doc id="252884" wikidata="Q1542713" url="?curid=252884" title="Minnesota Thunder">
<text>Minnesota Thunder was an American professional soccer team based in Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1990, the team played in the USL First Division (USL-1), the second tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, until 2009. The team played its home games at the National Sports Center in nearby Blaine, Minnesota for its final two seasons. The team&#x27;s colors were navy blue, light blue, silver, and white.

The team had a development team, Rochester Thunder, which independently played in USL Premier Development League for another season after the Thunder folded, and a sister organization, the Minnesota Lightning, which played in the women&#x27;s USL W-League.

==History==

===Before the Thunder===
Prior to the Minnesota Thunder forming in 1990 Minnesota had two former professional soccer teams. After two seasons as the Denver Dynamos the franchise was purchased by Minnesota investors and became the Minnesota Kicks. The Minnesota Kicks played the state&#x27;s first professional soccer game in May 1976 to a crowd of over 20,000 at Metropolitan Stadium. The team survived for six seasons competing in the North American Soccer League before folding after the 1981 season. After two years without a team the Fort Lauderdale Strikers were moved to Minnesota becoming the Minnesota Strikers in 1984. The team played one season in the NASL before transferring to the Major Indoor Soccer League. The team disbanded in 1988 after the 1987–1988 season.

===Independent era (1990–1993)===
The team was founded as an all star team in 1990. The team was composed of top amateur and former professional players who were mostly in their late 20s or early 30s. The team was coached by then Saint Paul Academy soccer coach Buzz Lagos. The team scheduled five exhibition games against teams in the A-League. At the time the goal was to eventually get a semipro soccer team for the Twin Cities.

The Thunder operated on a budget of $35,000 in their first year paying no salaries. The budget mainly supported stadium rental at the National Sports Center, office rental and promotions. In the first season the team played against the amateur Madison 56ers, professional San Francisco Bay Blackhawks and Winnipeg Fury and the indoor professional Chicago Power and Milwaukee Wave. Attendance averaged around 1,000 fans a game.

In the first season the team lost around $12,000. The next year, 1991, with the help of corporate sponsors Rainbow Foods, Kemps, and Liberty State Bank, the team played an expanded schedule with a record of eight victories and three ties losing $10,000 in the process. The following year the team added four more corporate sponsors and expected to lose about $5,000 with a budget of $45,000 By their third season the team became a model for teams in Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, and Canada due to their competitive schedule, reasonable budget and fan base. As an amateur team, the Thunder was responsible for an opponent&#x27;s hotel, food and lodging for each road trip. The team was undefeated through their first twenty games.

===Buzz Lagos era (1994–2005)===
On November 13, 1993 the Thunder announced its intention to join the U.S. Interregional Soccer League. The team joined the Midwest Region and retained their amateur status for the 1994 season. The team finished the year 25–2 losing in a sudden-death shootout to the Greensboro Dynamo in the championship game. The team became professional for the 1995 season.

On July 15, 2004 coach Buzz Lagos earned his 300th victory. It was his 123rd since the Thunder joined the A-League in 1997. Lagos improved his record to 300–127–31 all-time as coach of the Thunder. Five days later Lagos led the Thunder to their first victory over a MLS team in a nonexhibtion game. The Thunder defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy in fourth round U.S. Open Cup game played to 5,505 fans at the Metrodome. The 2004 season holds the highest average attendance with 4,400 over 14 home games.

Amos Magee played for the Thunder for 12 seasons, retired in 2005, is its all-time leading scorer (64 goals and 39 assists), and was inducted into the USL Hall of Fame in 2008. He was named first-team all-league in 1998, and A-League Championship MVP in 1999. He was inducted into the Minnesota Thunder Hall of Fame.

The 2005 season brought many changes to the Thunder. The Thunder&#x27;s A-League and the lower Pro Soccer League were reorganized. The Thunder were placed in the twelve team First Division which previously had sixteen teams. Additionally, the team was sold to an ownership led by majority owner Saeed Kadkhodaian. These changes led to Buzz Lagos announcing on August 1, 2005 that he would retire as coach after sixteen season. Lagos cited wanting to spend more time with his family as the main reason to retiring. On October 12, 2005, Amos Magee became the second head coach in the history of the Thunder. The Thunder also purchased a W-League team in 2005. The team was eventually named the Minnesota Lightning in 2006 before their opening season. 2005 was the only season the Thunder turned a profit, making $6,000 which was immediately paid in taxes to the state of Minnesota.

The Thunder defeated four MLS teams over the course of the 2004 and 2005 U.S. Open Cup competitions.

===Final years (2005–2009)===

Beginning in August 2007 the team spent $400,000 on a beer garden called the Thunder Lounge and started the Minnesota Thunder Academy. The team also founded the Rochester Thunder in the Premier Development League.

Magee resigned as Thunder manager on July 22, 2008, halfway through the 2008 season.

In November 2009 the Thunder announced their intent to leave the USL First Division to become the co-founders of a new North American Soccer League.

Minnesota&#x27;s participation in this new league was, however, not to be. In early November 2009 they released all players from their contracts, partly in response to heavy debts and unpaid bills, including wages. The organization was operating with a skeleton staff of 3 people as they tried to reorganize in their final days.

In January 2010, the National Sports Center announced the formation of a new club, the NSC Minnesota Stars that functioned as a replacement for the Thunder.

==Colors and badge==
A new logo using the colors of navy blue, light blue, and silver was unveiled for the 2008 season. The identity was designed by the Minneapolis design firm Capsule.

The previous Thunder badge incorporated the logo of a capital &#x27;T&#x27; and an active soccer ball on a shield reading &quot;Minnesota Thunder&quot;. When on the team uniform, it also is adorned atop by a gold star commemorating the 1999 championship season.

The initial Thunder crest was a soccer ball with a thunderbolt crossing it followed by the text &quot;Minnesota Thunder&quot;.

When the team became a professional organization, a new logo was created, consisting of an image of the state of Minnesota background with a soccer ball and thunderbolt imposed upon it.

In 2002, the Thunder undertook a marketing re-branding endeavor, where a new logo was created consisting of a soccer ball with movement lines and a T below the words of team&#x27;s name.

In 2006, a new navy and gold &quot;shield&quot; logo was created by the Minneapolis design firm CAPSULE.

The official mascot of the Minnesota Thunder was Thor.

==Stadiums==
* National Sports Center; Blaine, Minnesota (1990–2003, 2008–2009)
* James Griffin Stadium; St. Paul, Minnesota (2004–2007)
* Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome; Minneapolis, Minnesota 2 games (2004–2005)
* Macalester Stadium at Macalester College; St. Paul, Minnesota 1 game (2004)
* Stadium at Stillwater High School; Oak Park Heights, Minnesota 1 game (2004)

The Thunder&#x27;s first home field was the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota where they played until 2003. In 2003 the Thunder wanted to reduce the number of home games played at the National Sports Center to seven. The Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission which owns the National Sports Center was not comfortable with the idea so the Thunder decided to look elsewhere. Their three-year lease expired in 2003 leaving them open to search for other facilities for 2004. At the time revenue from the Thunder accounted for less than one percent of the National Sports Center&#x27;s total revenue. Barclay Kruse, the associate director of the Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission described the situation as, &quot;The best way to describe it is that we&#x27;re disappointed.&quot;

In 2004 the Thunder played home matches at James Griffin Stadium, also known as &quot;The Jimmy&quot;, in St Paul. The move to this stadium in central Saint Paul was made in an attempt to reduce overhead costs and market to a more urban and ethnic crowd. According to then president and general manager Jim Froslid some of the deciding were being on a bus line (mass transit does not go to Blaine) and being accessible to the ethnic community.
Fan surveys indicated that they would attend more games if the Thunder played in a more central location.

On May 12, 2008, they returned to the National Sports Center with a lease until 2011. At the time the Thunder was the only team in the USL to not play in a soccer specific stadium and the only team that played on with painted American football lines.

The Metrodome was occasionally used as a home field. Macalester Stadium at Macalester College in St. Paul was also used for games in the past. While playing at the National Sports Center the Thunder traditionally played several games a year in other locations notably Macalester College or Eastview High School in Apple Valley.

==Supporters==

The team&#x27;s largest supporters&#x27; group, the Dark Clouds, were founded in 2004 and worked with the Thunder organization to make improvements to their home stadium. After the Thunder folded, the group supported the NSC Minnesota Stars and Minnesota United FC—including its later MLS incarnation.

<doc id="252885" wikidata="Q3337328" url="?curid=252885" title="Navy Blues (album)">
<text>Navy Blues is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Sloan. Released on Murderecords in 1998, the album is slightly heavier than their two previous albums, showing an influence from 1970s rock mixed with their usual catchy, melodic, Beatles-esque sound. The album contains arguably their most popular song, &quot;Money City Maniacs,&quot; which went on to be used in a beer commercial at the time. The song also became a top 10 hit in the band&#x27;s native Canada and received heavy radio airplay. &quot;Navy Blues&quot; was certified Gold in Canada on June 12, 1998. By October 1998, the album had sold more than 70,000 copies. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 1999 Juno Awards.

The album&#x27;s cover art is a very direct copy of the movie poster for the 1959 Polish film &quot;Night Train&quot; (Polish: &quot;Pociąg&quot;).

== Trivia ==
* &quot;She Says What She Means&quot; was the last song recorded for the album. Chris Murphy wanted to make a hard rock song because he was jealous of Patrick Pentland&#x27;s rock songs &quot;Money City Maniacs&quot; and &quot;Iggy &amp; Angus&quot;.
* Murphy took the title of his song &quot;Chester the Molester&quot; from a name of a character in a Hustler magazine cartoon strip that his cousins used to call him. Murphy was reminded of the name by Mark Gaudet, the drummer from the Canadian bands Elevator To Hell and Eric&#x27;s Trip.
* The lyrics for &quot;I&#x27;m Not Through With You Yet&quot; were the original lyrics for &quot;Worried Now&quot; from Sloan&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;Twice Removed&quot;. Pentland originally titled the song with the words &quot;Cotton Picking&quot; because of its supposed &quot;Southern feel&quot;, but changed it out of fear that it might be taken as racist.

<doc id="252887" wikidata="Q1058544" url="?curid=252887" title="Sancho I of Portugal">
<text>Sancho I of Portugal (), nicknamed &quot;the Populator&quot; (), King of Portugal (Coimbra, 11 November 115426 March 1211) was the second but only surviving legitimate son and fifth child of Afonso I of Portugal by his wife, Maud of Savoy. Sancho succeeded his father and was crowned in Coimbra when he was 31 years old on 9 December 1185. He used the title King of Silves from 1189 until he lost the territory to Almohad control in 1191.

== Early life ==
Sancho was baptized with the name Martin (Martinho) since he was born on the feast day of Saint Martin of Tours. On 15 August 1170, he was knighted by his father, King Afonso I, and from then on he became his second in command, both administratively and militarily. At this time, the independence of Portugal (declared in 1139) was not firmly established. The kings of León and Castile were trying to re-annex the country and the Roman Catholic Church was late in giving its blessing and approval. Due to this situation Afonso I had to search for allies within the Iberian Peninsula. Portugal made an alliance with the Crown of Aragon and together they fought Castile and León. To secure the agreement, Sancho married Dulce, younger sister of King Alfonso II of Aragon, in 1174. Aragon was thus the first Iberian kingdom to recognize the independence of Portugal.

== Reign ==
With the death of Afonso I in 1185, Sancho I became the second king of Portugal. Coimbra was the centre of his kingdom; Sancho terminated the exhausting and generally pointless wars against his neighbours for control of the Galician borderlands. Instead, he turned all his attentions to the south. With the help of some soldiers on their way to join the Third Crusade, he sacked Alvor and took Silves in 1189, an event recounted in detail by an eyewitness in &quot;De itinere navali&quot;. Silves was an important city of the South, an administrative and commercial town with population estimates around 20,000 people. Sancho ordered the fortification of the city and built a castle which is today an important monument of Portuguese heritage. At the time he also styled himself &quot;By the Grace of God, King of Portugal and Silves (&quot;Dei Gratiæ, Rex Portugalliæ et Silbis&quot;)&quot;. 
However, military attention soon had to be turned again to the North, where León and Castile threatened again the Portuguese borders. Silves was again lost to the Moors in 1191.

Sancho I dedicated much of his reign to political and administrative organization of the new kingdom. He accumulated a national treasure, supported new industries and the middle class of merchants. Moreover, he created several new towns and villages (like Guarda in 1199) and took great care in populating remote areas in the northern Christian regions of Portugal – hence the nickname &quot;the Populator&quot;. The king was also known for his love of knowledge and literature. Sancho I wrote several books of poems and used the royal treasure to send Portuguese students to European universities. He died in Coimbra, aged 56.

==Marriage and issue==
Sancho married Dulce of Aragon, daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona and Petronilla, Queen of Aragon. Eleven children were born from this marriage, eight of whom reached adulthood:

* Theresa (1175/117618 June 1250), married Alfonso IX of León and was beatified in 1705;
* Sancha (118013 March 1229), founded the Monastery of Celas near Coimbra where she lived until her death. Her sister Theresa arranged for her burial at the Monastery of Lorvão. She was beatified by Pope Clement XI in 1705, the same year as Theresa;
* Constanza (May 1182before 1186 or August 1202). According to Rodrigues Oliveira, she must have died before 1186 since her name is not registered in any of the documents of the chancellery of Sancho I which begins in that year. However, the necrology of São Salvador de Moreira records the death &quot;&quot;III Nonas Augusti&quot; in 1202 of &quot;Domna Constantia Infantula filia regis domni Sancii et reginæ domnæ Dulciæ&quot;&quot;;
* Afonso (23 April 118625 March 1223), succeeded his father as the third king of Portugal;
* Raimundo (1187/889 March bef. 1188/89), died in infancy;
* Peter (23 February 11872 June 1258), married Aurembiaix, Countess of Urgell;
* Ferdinand (24 March 118827 July 1233), married Joan, Countess of Flanders;
* Henry (aft. March 11898 Dec aft. 1189), died in infancy;
* Mafalda (1195/11961 May 1256), married Henry I of Castile and was beatified in 1793;
* Branca (119817 November 1240), probably the twin sister of Berengaria, was raised in the court with her father and his mistress &quot;a Ribeirinha&quot; and, when she was eight or ten years old, was sent to live with her sisters at the Monastery of Lorvão. She was a nun at a convent in Guadalajara and was buried at the same monastery as her mother;
* Berengaria (119827 March 1221), probably the twin sister of Branca, married Valdemar II of Denmark in 1214.

===Illegitimate Children===
With Maria Aires de Fornelos, daughter of Aires Nunes de Fornelos and Maior Pais, who was buried at the Monastery of Santo Tirso in accordance with her last will, Sancho had two children, both born before his marriage to Dulce of Aragon:
* Martim Sanches (born before 1175) Count of Trastámara. Martim married Elo Pérez de Castro, daughter of Pedro Fernández de Castro, with no issue from this marriage;
* Urraca Sanches (born before 1175), was married to Lourenço Soares, son of Soeiro Viegas and Sancha Bermúdez de Traba.
After Dulce&#x27;s death, he had an affair with María Pais de Ribeira &quot;a Ribeiriña&quot; for whom he is often said to have written and dedicated a cantiga de amigo, &quot;A Ribeirinha&quot;, composed in 1199, the oldest text known in Portuguese poetry. That is contested nowadays by the Portuguese historian António de Resende Oliveira, who claims this cantiga was composed by Alfonso X of Castile or perhaps Sancho II of Portugal. At least six children were born of this relationship: 
* Rodrigo Sanches (died 1245), had a bastard son with Constança Afonso de Cambra called Afonso Rodrigues, a Franciscan friar and the &quot;Guardian of the Convent of Lisbon&quot;;
* Gil Sanches (died on 14 September 1236), a cleric and troubadour, his father left him 8,000 morabetinos in his will. Gil granted &quot;fueros&quot; to the settlers of Sardezas in 1213;
* Nuno Sanches, died during childhood on a 16 December in an unknown year. He could have been the son of Maria Aires de Fornelos;
* Maior Sanches, also died at an early age on 27 August of an unknown year;
* Teresa Sanches, her father left her 7,000 morabetinos in his will. She was the second wife of Alfonso Téllez de Meneses whom she married before 1220 and with whom she had issue;
* Constança Sanches (12048 August 1269). Her father left her 7,000 morabetinos in his will. She was the godmother of her grand-niece Infanta Sancha and left her half of Vila do Conde, Avelaneda, Pousadela, Parada and Maçãs. She also owned estates in Torres Vedras.

Sancho had a son with Maria Moniz de Ribeira, daughter of Munio Osorio, tenente of the comarca of Cabreira and Ribera, and of Maria Nunes of Grijó:
* Pedro Moniz, who married a woman whose name is not recorded, and was the father of Maria Peres de Cabreira, the wife of Martim Peres Machado, the first to use the last name Machado.

<doc id="252891" wikidata="Q203996" url="?curid=252891" title="Sancho II of Portugal">
<text>Sancho II (; 8 September 1207 – 4 January 1248), nicknamed the Cowled or the Capuched (), alternatively, the Pious (), was King of Portugal from 1223 to 1248. He was succeeded on the Portuguese throne by his brother, King Afonso III, in 1248.

Sancho was born in Coimbra, the eldest son of Afonso II of Portugal by his wife, Urraca of Castile.

==Military career and reign==

By the time of his accession to the throne, in 1223, Portugal was embroiled in a difficult diplomatic conflict with the Catholic Church. His father, Afonso II, had been excommunicated by Pope Honorius III, for his attempts at reducing the Church&#x27;s power within the country. A treaty of 10 articles was signed between the Pope and Sancho II, but the king paid little attention to its fulfillment. His priority was the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, the reconquest of the southern Iberian Peninsula from the Moors. From 1236 onwards, Sancho II conquered several cities in the Algarve and Alentejo, securing the Portuguese position in the region.

==Dispossession from throne==
Sancho II proved a capable commander but, with regard to equally important administrative issues, he was less competent. With his total attention focused on military campaigns, the ground was open for internal disputes. The nobility was displeased by the king&#x27;s conduct and started to conspire against him. Moreover, the middle class of merchants quarrelled frequently with the clergy, without any intervention from the king. As a result, the bishop of Porto made a formal complaint to the pope about this state of affairs. Since the Church was the dominant power of the 13th century, Pope Innocent IV felt free to issue bull &quot;Grandi non immerito&quot;, ordering the Portuguese to choose a new king to replace the so-called heretic.

In 1246, recalcitrant nobles invited Sancho&#x27;s brother Afonso, Count of Boulogne, to take the throne. Afonso immediately abdicated from his French possessions and marched into Portugal.

==Exile and death==
After a civil war lasting from late 1245 to mid 1247 and a Castilian intervention by the Castilian heir, Prince Alfonso, he fled in exile to Toledo, Spain when Alfonso retreated his forces to support his father in the siege of Seville. He died in Toledo on 4 January 1248 and was buried in its cathedral.

==Marriage==
Sancho married, circa 1240, a Castilian lady, Mécia Lopes de Haro, widow of Alvaro Peres de Castro, and daughter of Lope Díaz II de Haro and Urraca Alfonso de León, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso IX of León, but they had no legitimate sons.

<doc id="252892" wikidata="Q1351694" url="?curid=252892" title="USL First Division">
<text>The USL First Division (usually referred to as USL-1) was a professional men&#x27;s soccer league in the United States and Canada from 2005 to 2010.

During its existence, it formed the second tier of soccer in the United States soccer league system behind Major League Soccer. It was operated by United Soccer Leagues (USL) and was known as the A-League, from 1997 until 2004.

Several teams left the league in 2009 to form the new North American Soccer League, with the intent of running their own second-tier league. Following a brief legal dispute, the two leagues operated in tandem under United States Soccer Federation (USSF) mediation as the USSF Division 2 Professional League in 2010 before the split became final. The teams that remained in the First Division were merged with the USL Second Division in 2011 to form USL Pro.

== History ==

When the A-League became the USL First Division in 2005, the league comprised 12 teams: Atlanta Silverbacks, Charleston Battery, Minnesota Thunder, Montreal Impact, Portland Timbers, Puerto Rico Islanders, Richmond Kickers, Rochester Raging Rhinos, Seattle Sounders, Toronto Lynx, Vancouver Whitecaps, and Virginia Beach Mariners. The Calgary Mustangs, Edmonton Aviators, and Syracuse Salty Dogs, all of whom competed in the final A-League season in 2004, folded during the offseason, and did not take up their places in the new league.

The Seattle Sounders won the inaugural USL1 championship, beating Richard on penalty kicks in the championship game after a 1–1 tie in regulation time. The Vancouver Whitecaps won the first of their two USL1 titles in 2006 by beating the Rochester Raging Rhinos 3–0 in the championship game, while Seattle won their second title in 2007 by overcoming the Atlanta Silverbacks in a one-sided 4–0 final. Vancouver won their second USL1 championship in 2008 by beating the Puerto Rico Islanders 2–1 in the first USL1 final to feature no American teams; the championship went north of the border again in 2009 when Montreal Impact won their first USL1 title, beating Vancouver 6–3 on aggregate over two legs in the first all-Canadian affair.

On August 27, 2009, Nike agreed to sell its stake in the United Soccer Leagues (USL) to Rob Hoskins and Alec Papadakis of Atlanta-based NuRock Soccer Holdings, instead of to the USL Team Owner&#x27;s Association (TOA), a group comprising the owners of several USL First Division clubs. In the months that followed, several prominent TOA members began to voice their concerns about the state of the league in general, its management structure and ownership model, the leadership of USL president Francisco Marcos, and about the sale of the league to NuRock, which the TOA felt was counter-productive and detrimental to the development of the league. Within several weeks, a number of TOA member clubs threatened to break away from USL and start their own league; this break away became official on November 10, 2009, when the majority of USL-1 clubs, as well as one of the expected 2010 expansion franchises, applied to the United States Soccer Federation, the Canadian Soccer Association, and FIFA for approval to create a new North American Soccer League, reducing the league&#x27;s membership to just three teams.

After lawsuits were filed and heated press statements exchanged, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) declared they would sanction neither the NASL nor the USL First Division in 2010, and ordered both &quot;camps&quot; to work together on a plan to temporarily allow their teams to play a 2010 season. The interim solution was announced on January 7, 2010, with the USSF running the new USSF D2 Pro League comprising clubs from both USL-1 and NASL. All 12 teams from the USL First Division and the NASL competed in the USSF D2 Pro League in 2010, which was won by the Puerto Rico Islanders.

On September 8, 2010, the USL announced the formation of USL Pro which would merge the USL First Division and USL Second Division to begin play in 2011. The merger is meant to consolidate USL&#x27;s position within the American professional soccer landscape and focus on commercial growth and professional development of soccer in 4 main regions throughout the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean. The First Division was formally dissolved following the completion of the temporary season to make way for USL Pro.

=== Expansion and contraction ===
Prior to 2010, the league had a steady rate of expansion and contraction. Richmond was voluntarily relegated to the USL Second Division in 2006 to cut costs, Toronto was voluntarily relegated to the USL Premier Development League in 2007 because of MLS expansion, and on March 30, 2007, the Virginia Beach Mariners folded just prior to the start of the 2007 season due to an ownership dispute which left the team without financing. These teams were replaced by two new teams: the Carolina RailHawks from the Triangle region of North Carolina, playing out of Cary, and California Victory, a team in Northern California under the ownership of Dmitry Piterman (chairman of Spanish team Deportivo Alavés) which folded after the end of the 2007 season, having played only one season.

In November 2008, the Atlanta Silverbacks announced that they would sit out the 2009 season to &quot;reassess the landscape,&quot; and would possibly return at a future date.
Similarly, the Seattle Sounders left prior to the 2009 season due to the imminent entrance of Seattle Sounders FC into Major League Soccer. Their spot in the league was taken by the Cleveland City Stars, who won the USL Second Division title in 2008, and voluntarily moved up to USL-1 for the 2009 season, folded at the end of the year. On December 2, 2009, Inside Minnesota Soccer reported that the USL had asked the City Stars to terminate the contracts of all the players, as the franchise was to be dissolved. Posting an email addressed to all players under contract with the Cleveland City Stars and written by team president Jonathan Ortlip and executive director Aaron Tredway, the club executives went on to accept the decision to terminate the franchise.

On June 19, 2008, an announcement was made that an expansion slot had been awarded to a Tampa Bay, Florida-based franchise led by main investors Andrew Nestor (CEO) and Hinds Howard (chairman) of Citrus Ventures. The plan was for the club to join the league in 2010 and be named the Tampa Bay Rowdies.

=== Expansion rumors ===
Possible cities mentioned for future campaigns included Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Syracuse, New York. Syracuse had had a highly attended team in the A-League from 2002 to 2004, but it folded due to stadium issues, having ground-shared with the local baseball team. Fort Lauderdale also had a history of teams from the NASL, American Soccer League, and USL First Division. There was also discussion that Argentinian team River Plate is interested in putting a second USL team in Puerto Rico, as well as discussion that recent start-up team, the San Diego Flash may also join either the USL or NASL.

Prior to the 2009 NASL split several other cities had been mentioned as being locations where future USL-1 franchises might launch, including St. Louis, Missouri (led by the current USL Premier Development League (PDL) franchise St. Louis Lions); Orlando, Florida (with Mexican side Pachuca being rumored as connected to it); Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Hamilton, Ontario; San Antonio, Texas; and Ottawa, Ontario. On September 1, 2009, a group from Ottawa formally applied for USL-1 team, contingent on the approval of updates to Lansdowne Park. The team would share a field with the Ottawa Redblacks football team. The Ottawa group subsequently committed to the NASL.

== Structure ==
Unlike most other nations, there is no system of merit-based promotion and relegation in the American and Canadian pyramids, meaning that the champions of USL-1 could not move up to Major League Soccer and, similarly, the worst teams in MLS were not in danger of being demoted to USL-1. However, some USL-1 teams had in the past chosen to take voluntary relegation to a lower level of the USL system, often to reduce operating costs, while teams had also decided to move up to USL-1 after finding success at the lower levels.

=== Playoff format ===
The top seven teams advanced to the playoff tournament, with the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup winner (regular season champion) receiving a bye into the semi-finals. Each round consisted of two legs, the lower seeded team hosting the first leg, and the higher seed hosting the second. Prior to 2009, the final was played as a single leg at the higher seed&#x27;s stadium. After the first legs were completed, the lowest remaining seed played the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup winner, and the higher seeds played each other. The highest remaining seed hosted the penultimate game of the Finals. The playoffs started the week after the completion of the regular season, and typically ended in mid-October.

<text>4 Nights at the Palais Royale is a live album released by the Canadian rock band Sloan in 1999. It was mostly recorded from four live shows performed at the Palais Royale in Toronto, Ontario in 1998, although some of the songs were taken from other concerts on their 1998 Navy Blues tour. The band and fans alike consider it a fairly accurate representation of a typical Sloan concert, with a mix of old and new songs and plenty of audience participation.

* Chris Murphy – bass guitar, drums, vocals
* Andrew Scott – drums, guitar, vocals

<text>Peter I (Portuguese: &quot;Pedro I&quot;, ; 8 April 1320 – 18 January 1367), known as the Just (&quot;o Justiceiro&quot;) or the Cruel (&quot;o Cruel&quot;), was King of Portugal from 1357 until his death.
==Early life==
Born on 8 April 1320 in Coimbra, Peter was the fifth child of Afonso of Portugal and his wife, Beatrice of Castile. Of his six siblings, only two – sisters Maria and Eleonor – survived infancy.

At six years old, shortly after his father ascended the crown, Peter was granted a retinue of six people, including his butler and tutor Lopo Fernandes Pacheco. 

===First betrothal===
In October 1327, marriage contracts were negotiated for Peter and Blanche of Castile, granddaughter of Sancho IV of Castile, and Peter&#x27;s sister Maria and the future Alfonso XI of Castile. Since both Peter and Blanche were minors, the marriage had to wait. Blanche was taken to be raised in Portugal until she was of age for marriage, where she remained for eight years. According to the Chronicle of Pedro I of Portugal by Fernão Lopes, during her stay, she began to show signs of illness and &quot;defects of judgement&quot; which made her unsuitable for marriage and for procreation. She was examined by physicians, including those sent by Alfonso XI, who confirmed her weak mental health and incapacity, and, because of &quot;Infante Pedro&#x27;s refusal and the evident mental disorder of doña Blanca&quot; the proposed marriage never took place.

===Marriage===
In 1328, Peter&#x27;s eldest sister, Maria, was married to Alfonso XI of Castile. However, soon after their marriage Alfonso began a long affair with the beautiful and newly widowed Leonor de Guzman. Maria bore Alfonso a son in 1334, who ultimately became Peter of Castile, but after the Castilian king refused to end his affair, Maria returned home to Portugal in 1335.

Alfonso had been married once before, to his cousin&#x27;s daughter, Constanza Manuel (granddaughter of James II of Aragon). Alfonso had the marriage annulled in 1327, after only two years, to clear the way for marriage to Maria. This angered his cousin Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, a powerful Castilian aristocrat, and for two years Juan Manuel waged war against the Castilians – who had kept his daughter Constanza hostage – until Bishop John del Campo of Oviedo mediated a peace in 1329.

Alfonso, now enraged by the infidelity and mistreatment of his daughter Maria, forged an alliance with Juan Manual by marrying his son and heir, Peter, to Constanza. When Constanza arrived in Portugal in 1340, Inês de Castro, the beautiful and aristocratic daughter of a prominent Galician family (with links albeit through illegitimacy, to the Portuguese and Castilian royal families), accompanied her as her lady-in-waiting.

===Affair===

Peter soon fell in love with Inês, and the two conducted a long love affair that lasted until Inês&#x27;s murder in 1355. Constanza died in 1349, following childbirth complications. The scandal of Peter&#x27;s affair with Inês, and its political ramifications, caused Afonso to banish Inês from court after Constanza died. Peter refused to marry any of the princesses his father suggested as a second wife; and the king refused to allow his son to marry Inês as Peter wanted. The two aristocratic lovers began living together in secret. According to the chronicle of Fernão Lopes, during this period, Peter began giving Inês&#x27;s brothers, exiled from the Castilian court, important positions in Portugal and they became the heir-apparent&#x27;s closest advisors. This alarmed Afonso. He worried that upon his death, civil war could tear the country apart, or the Portuguese throne would fall into Castilian hands, either as Juan Manuel fought to avenge his daughter&#x27;s honor, or the de Castro brothers supported their sister. Peter claimed that he had married Inês against his father&#x27;s orders. In any event, in 1355, Afonso sent three men to find Inês at the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha in Coimbra, where she was detained, and they decapitated her in front of one of her young children. Enraged, Peter revolted against his father. Afonso defeated his son within a year, but died shortly thereafter, and Peter succeeded to the throne in 1357. The love affair and father-son conflict inspired more than twenty operas and many writers, including: the Portuguese national epic &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; by Luís de Camões, the Spanish &quot;Nise lastimosa&quot; and &quot;Nise laureada&quot; (1577) by Jerónimo Bermúdez and &quot;Reinar despues de morir&quot; by Luís Vélez de Guevara, as well as &quot;Inez de Castro&quot; by Mary Russell Mitford and Henry de Montherlant&#x27;s French drama &quot;La Reine morte&quot;.

===Possible bisexuality===

In the chronicle of Fernão Lopes, the author included a chapter entitled &quot;How the King ordered his squire to be capped because he slept with a married woman&quot;, leading some modern authors to suggest this &quot;capping&quot; (castration) was rather motivated by the king&#x27;s jealousy. The squire, Afonso Madeira, is described as a great rider, hunter, fighter and agile acrobat, and records: &quot;For his qualities, the King loved him very much and did him generous favors.&quot; Madeira, however, fell in love with Catarina Tosse, a married woman described as &quot;brave, mad and very elegant, of graceful gifts and good society&quot;. To get closer to her, Madeira befriended her husband, and was thus eventually able to seduce her. The sovereign, however, is claimed to have discovered the affair, and decreed upon Madeira a brutal punishment—though the chronicler, enigmatically, insists upon the affection of the sovereign for the man, stating: &quot;As much as the King loved the squire very much, more than should be said here [...]&quot; Nevertheless, the chronicle records that Peter I ordered that &quot;those limbs that men in greater esteem have&quot; be cut from the unfortunate squire. Madeira is supposed to have received assistance and survived, but &quot;thickened in legs and body and lived for a few years with a wrinkled face and no beard&quot;.

According to the same chronicle, Peter I stuttered and had epileptic seizures.

==Reign==
Peter reigned for a decade, and is often confused with his Castilian nephew because of their identical nicknames. Fernão Lopes labels Peter &quot;the Just&quot; and said that the Portuguese king loved justice—especially the dispensing of it, which he enjoyed doing for himself. Inês&#x27; assassins received his harshest punishment: the three had escaped to Castile, but Peter arranged for them to be exchanged for Castilian fugitives residing in Portugal with his nephew, Peter of Castile. The Portuguese king conducted a public trial of Pêro Coelho and Álvaro Gonçalves in 1361. After finding them guilty of Inês&#x27; murder, the king ripped their hearts out with his own hands, according to Lopes, because of what they had done to his own heart. Diogo Lopes Pacheco escaped and died in 1393.

According to legend, Peter later had Inês&#x27; body exhumed and placed upon a throne, dressed in rich robes and jewels, and required all of his vassals to kiss the hand of the deceased &quot;queen&quot;. However, contemporary evidence that the event occurred is minimal; Peter did have Inês&#x27; body removed from her resting place in Coimbra and taken to Alcobaça where it was reburied in the royal monastery. Peter had two tombs constructed, one for each of them, so they would see each other when rising at the Last Judgment. The tombs show Peter and Inês facing each other, with the words &quot;Até o fim do mundo...&quot; (&quot;Until the end of the world...&quot;) inscribed on the marble.

Peter was also the father of Ferdinand I of Portugal and John I of Portugal. John was the Master of the military order of Avis, and he would become the founder of the Avis dynasty after the 1383–85 Crisis.

<doc id="252903" wikidata="Q1098121" url="?curid=252903" title="Claudio Naranjo">
<text>Claudio Benjamín Naranjo Cohen (24 November 1932 – 12 July 2019) was a Chilean psychiatrist who is considered a pioneer in integrating psychotherapy and the spiritual traditions. He was one of the three successors named by Fritz Perls (founder of Gestalt Therapy), a student of Oscar Ichazo who originally developed the Enneagram of Personality, and a founder of the Seekers After Truth Institute. He was also an elder statesman of the US and global human potential movement and the spiritual renaissance of the late 20th century. Naranjo authored several books.

==Early life and education==

Naranjo was born in Valparaíso, Chile. He grew up in a musical environment and after an early start at the piano he studied musical composition. Shortly after entrance to medical school, he stopped composing as he became more involved in philosophical interests. Important influences from this time were Chilean visionary sculptor, philosopher and poet Tótila Albert Schneider (1892-1967), poet David Rosenmann-Taub, and Polish philosopher Bogumił Jasinowski (1883-1969).

==Career==

After graduating as a medical doctor in 1959, Naranjo was hired by the University of Chile Medical School to form part of a pioneering studies center in medical anthropology (CEAM) (Centro de Antropología Médica), founded by professor of physiology Franz Hoffmann (1902-1981). At the same time, he served his psychiatry residency at the University Psychiatry Clinic under the direction of Ignacio Matte Blanco.

Involved in research on the effects of traditional medical education, Naranjo traveled briefly to the United States during a mission assigned by the University of Chile to explore the field of perceptual learning. It is at that time that he became acquainted with the work of Samuel Renshaw and Hoyt Sherman at the Ohio State University.

In 1962, Naranjo was at Harvard as a visiting Fulbright scholar at the Center for Studies of Personality and Emerson Hall, where he was a participant in Gordon Allport&#x27;s Social Psychology Seminar and a student of Paul Tillich. He became Raymond Cattell&#x27;s associate at the Institute of Personality and Ability Testing (IPAT) in 1963. After a brief return to his native country, he was invited to Berkeley, California, for a year and a half to participate in the activities of the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research (IPAR).

After another period at the University of Chile Medical School&#x27;s Center of Medical Anthropology Studies and at the Instituto de Psicología, , Naranjo returned once again to Berkeley and to IPAR, where he continued his activities as a research associate. It was during this period of time that he became an apprentice of Fritz Perls and part of the early Gestalt Therapy community, where he began conducting workshops at the Esalen Institute as a visiting associate. He eventually became one of Perls&#x27; three successors, along with Jack Downing (1924-1993) and Robert Hall (1934-2019).

In the years that led up to his becoming a key figure at Esalen, Naranjo received additional training and supervision from Jim Simkin in Los Angeles and attended sensory awareness workshops with Charlotte Selver. He became Carlos Castaneda&#x27;s close friend and became part of Leo Zeff&#x27;s pioneering psychedelic therapy group (1965–66). These meetings resulted in Naranjo’s contribution of the use of harmaline, MDA, and ibogaine.

In the 1960s, Naranjo introduced ibogaine and harmaline into psychotherapy as a &quot;fantasy enhancing drug.&quot;

Richard Evans Schultes allowed for Naranjo to make a special journey by canoe up the Amazon River to study yage with the South American Indians. He brought back samples of this drug and published the first scientific description of the effects of its active alkaloids.

In 1969 he was sought out as a consultant for the Education Policy Research Center, created by Willis Harman at Stanford Research Institute. His report as to what in the domain of psychological and spiritual techniques in vogue was applicable to education later became his first book, &quot;The One Quest&quot;. During this same period, he co-authored a book with Robert Ornstein on meditation. Also, an invitation from Ravenna Helson to examine the qualitative differences between books representative of the &quot;Matriarchal&quot; and &quot;Patriarchal&quot; factors lead to his writing &quot;The Divine Child and the Hero&quot;, which would be published much later.

The accidental death of his only son in 1970 marked a turning point in his life. Naranjo set off on a six-month pilgrimage under the guidance of Oscar Ichazo (1931-2020), the founder of the Arica School and the original developer of the Enneagram of Personality. Naranjo considered this spiritual retreat in the Atacama Desert near Arica, Chile, to be the true beginning of his spiritual experience, contemplative life and inner guidance.

According to John C. Lilly, Naranjo was &quot;summarily ejected&quot; from the Arica School. When leaving Arica, he retained tape recordings he had made of Ichazo&#x27;s lectures, and despite having not received permission from Ichazo to teach Arica School material, he began teaching a group that included his mother, Gestalt trainees and friends. This Chilean group, which began as an improvisation, took shape as a program and originated a non-profit corporation called the SAT Institute. These early years of the SAT Institute were implemented by a series of guest teachers, including Zalman Schachter, Ajahn Dhiravamsa (1934-2021), Yang Style Tai Chi Master Ch&#x27;u Fang Chu (Zhū Chǔ Fāng) (1912-1988), Harish Johari (1934-1999), and Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hoffman (1922-1997), originator of the Hoffman Quadrinity Process.

In 1976, Naranjo was a visiting professor at the Santa Cruz campus of the University of California for two semesters and later intermittently at the California Institute of Asian Studies. He also began to offer workshops in Europe, refining aspects of the mosaic of approaches in the SAT program.

In 1987, he began the reborn SAT Institute in Spain for personal and professional development, with its program that includes Gestalt therapy and its supervision, applications of the Enneagram of Personality, interpersonal meditation, music as a therapeutic resource and as an extension of meditation, guided self-insight and communication processes. Since then, the SAT program has extended to Italy, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina and more recently to France and Germany.

Since the late 1980s, Naranjo had divided each year between his activities abroad and his writing at home in Berkeley. Among his many publications, he revised an early book on Gestalt therapy and published two new ones. He published three books on the Enneagram of Personality, as well as &quot;The End of Patriarchy&quot;, which is his interpretation of social problems as the expression of a devaluation of the nurturance and human instinct and their solution in the harmonious development of our &quot;three brained&quot; potential. He also published a book on meditation, &quot;The Way of Silence and the Talking Cure&quot;, and &quot;Songs of Enlightenment&quot; on the interpretation of the great books of the West as expressions of &quot;the inner journey&quot; and variations on the &quot;tale of the hero&quot;.

In 1990, the Arica School, whose materials Naranjo had not returned after his expulsion, considered taking legal action against Naranjo for the unauthorized use of Arica School materials and recordings. While Arica did not pursue legal action against Naranjo, due to his claim that he had never denied the origin of the material, it did pursue copyright claims against some of Naranjo&#x27;s direct and indirect students for their failure to attribute Ichazo as the originator of the material. Many of these writers had falsely attributed Sufi or Jesuit origins for the material rather than acknowledging Ichazo as the originator of the theory. While these legal actions were mostly unsuccessful, the United States Court of Appeals ruled that Ichazo was the original author of the application of the enneagram figure to a theory of ego fixations.

From the 1990s and onward, Naranjo attended many education conferences and sought to influence the transformation of the educational system in various countries. His book &quot;Changing Education to Change the World&quot; published in Spanish in 2004, was meant to stimulate the efforts of teachers among SAT graduates who are beginning to be involved in a SAT-in- Education project, that offers the staff of schools and the students in schools of education a &quot;supplementary curriculum&quot; of self-knowledge, relationship-repair and spiritual culture.

In 2006 the Foundation Claudio Naranjo was founded to implement his proposals regarding the transformation of traditional education into an education that does not neglect the human development that he believed our social evolution depends on.

His 2010 book, &quot;Healing Civilization: Bringing Personal Transformation into the Societal Realm through Education and the Integration of the Intra-Psychic Family&quot;, is both a continuation of and a turning point in Naranjo&#x27;s lifelong work. In this book, with a foreword by Jean Houston, Naranjo explored what he saw as the root cause of the destruction of human civilization (as evidenced in the 2000s (decade) as war, violence, oppression of women, child abuse, environmental endangerment, etc.)—patriarchy—and brought both the problem and the solution home to an intra-psychic level.

&quot;Watkins Mind Body Spirit&quot; magazine listed Naranjo as one of the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People of 2012.

<text>Between the Bridges is the fifth album by Canadian rock band Sloan. The album was recorded in six weeks and was released in 1999 on Murderecords. The album continued the band&#x27;s progression towards 1970s-influenced rock mixed with 1960s and 70s influenced pop. The album marks a pivotal move forward for the group, expanding on their influences and featured another successful single in their native Canada, &quot;Losing California&quot;.

The album&#x27;s &quot;quick and photocopy looking&quot; cover art was inspired by a black-and-white photo of the movie poster for the 1969 satirical comedy &quot;Putney Swope&quot;, which band member Jay Ferguson saw in a book.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;though many dismissed the album as creatively arrested, its suite-like construction and autobiographical structure makes it Sloan&#x27;s most fully realized effort.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot; called the album &quot;a pop thrill from start to finish.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;the fact that all four musicians both write and sing gives the sound breadth, yet at no cost to cohesiveness.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
By October 2001, the album had sold 40,000 copies worldwide.

<doc id="252905" wikidata="Q486761" url="?curid=252905" title="Classical antiquity">
<text>Classical antiquity, also known as the classical era, classical period, classical age, or simply antiquity, is the period of cultural European history between the 8th century BC and the 5th century AD comprising the interwoven civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome known together as the Greco-Roman world, centered on the Mediterranean Basin. It is the period during which ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished and had major influence throughout much of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia.

Conventionally, it is often considered to begin with the earliest recorded Epic Greek poetry of Homer (8th–7th-century BC) and ends with the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. Such a wide span of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. &quot;Classical antiquity&quot; may also refer to an idealized vision among later people of what was, in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s words, &quot;the glory that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome&quot;.

The culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the ancient Near East, was the basis of art, philosophy, society, and education in the Mediterranean and Near East until the Roman imperial period. The Romans preserved, imitated, and spread this culture throughout Europe, until they were able to compete with it. This Greco-Roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the language, politics, law, educational systems, philosophy, science, warfare, literature, historiography, ethics, rhetoric, art and architecture of both the Western, and through it, the modern world.

Surviving fragments of classical culture helped produce a revival beginning during the 14th century which later came to be known as the Renaissance, and various neo-classical revivals occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries.

==History==
===Archaic period (c. 8th to c. 6th centuries BC)===
The earliest period of classical antiquity occurs during a time of gradual resurgence of historical sources after the Late Bronze Age collapse. The 8th and 7th centuries BC are still largely protohistorical, with the earliest Greek alphabetic inscriptions appearing during the first half of the 8th century. The legendary poet Homer is usually assumed to have lived during the 8th or 7th century BC, and his lifetime is often considered as the beginning of classical antiquity. During the same period is the traditional date for the establishment of the Ancient Olympic Games, in 776 BC.

====Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Assyrians====

The Phoenicians originally expanded from ports in Canaan, by the 8th century dominating trade in the Mediterranean. Carthage was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had established strongholds in Sicily, Italy and Sardinia, which created conflicts of interest with Etruria. A stele found in Kition, Cyprus, commemorates the victory of King Sargon II in 709 BC over the seven kings of the island, marking an important part of the transfer of Cyprus from Tyrian rule to the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

====Greece====
The Archaic period followed the Greek Dark Ages, and saw significant advancements in political theory, and the beginnings of democracy, philosophy, theatre, poetry, as well as the revitalization of the written language (which had been lost during the Dark Ages).

In pottery, the Archaic period sees the development of the Orientalizing style, which signals a shift from the geometric style of the later Dark Ages and the accumulation of influences derived from Egypt, Phoenicia and Syria.

Pottery styles associated with the later part of the Archaic age are the black-figure pottery, which originated in Corinth during the 7th-century BC and its successor, the red-figure style, developed by the Andokides Painter in about 530 BC.

====Greek colonies====
====Iron Age Italy====
The Etruscans had established political control in the region by the late 7th-century BC, forming the aristocratic and monarchial elite. The Etruscans apparently lost power in the area by the late 6th-century BC, and at this time, the Italic tribes reinvented their government by creating republics, with greater restraints on the ability of individual rulers to exercise power.

====Roman kingdom====
According to legend, Rome was founded on 21 April 753 BC by twin descendants of the Trojan prince Aeneas, Romulus and Remus. As the city was bereft of women, legend says that the Latins invited the Sabines to a festival and stole their unmarried maidens, resulting the integration of Latins and Sabines.

Archaeological evidence indeed shows first traces of settlement at the Roman Forum in the mid-8th century BC, though settlements on the Palatine Hill may date back to the 10th century BC.

According to legend, the seventh and final king of Rome was Tarquinius Superbus. As the son of Tarquinius Priscus and the son-in-law of Servius Tullius, Superbus was of Etruscan birth. It was during his reign that the Etruscans reached their apex of power. Superbus removed and destroyed all the Sabine shrines and altars from the Tarpeian Rock, enraging the people of Rome. The people came to object to his rule when he failed to recognize the rape of Lucretia, a patrician Roman, by his own son. Lucretia&#x27;s kinsman, Lucius Junius Brutus (ancestor to Marcus Brutus), summoned the Senate and had Superbus and the monarchy expelled from Rome in 510 BC. After Superbus&#x27; expulsion, the Senate in 509 BC voted to never again allow the rule of a king and reformed Rome into a republican government.

===Classical Greece (5th to 4th centuries BC)===

The classical period of ancient Greece corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, in particular, from the end of the Athenian tyranny in 510 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. In 510, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow the tyrant Hippias, son of Peisistratos. Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, established a pro-Spartan oligarchy conducted by Isagoras.

The Greco-Persian Wars (499–449 BC), concluded by the Peace of Callias ended with not only the liberation of Greece, Macedon, Thrace, and Ionia from Persian rule, but also with the dominance of Athens in the Delian League, which resulted in conflict with Sparta and the Peloponnesian League, resulting in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), ending with a Spartan victory.

Greece began the 4th century with Spartan hegemony, but by 395 BC the Spartan rulers dismissed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost its naval supremacy. Athens, Argos, Thebes and Corinth, the latter two of which were formerly Spartan allies, challenged Spartan dominance in the Corinthian War, which ended inconclusively in 387 BC. Later, in 371 BC, the Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas won a victory at the Battle of Leuctra. The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban hegemony. Thebes sought to maintain its dominance until it was finally ended by the increasing power of Macedon in 346 BC.

During the reign of Philip II, (359–336 BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the Paeonians, the Thracians and the Illyrians. Philip&#x27;s son, Alexander the Great, (356–323 BC) managed to briefly extend Macedonian power not only over the central Greek city-states but also to the Persian Empire, including Egypt and lands as far east as the fringes of India. The classical Greek period conventionally ends at the death of Alexander in 323 BC and the fragmentation of his empire, which was at this time divided among the Diadochi.

===Hellenistic period (323–146 BC)===
Greece began the Hellenistic period with the increasing power of Macedon and the conquests of Alexander the Great. Greek became the &quot;lingua franca&quot; far beyond Greece itself, and Hellenistic culture interacted with the cultures of Persia, the Kingdom of Israel and Kingdom of Judah, Central Asia and Egypt. Significant advances were made in the sciences (geography, astronomy, mathematics, etc.), notably with the followers of Aristotle (Aristotelianism).

The Hellenistic period ended with the increase of the Roman Republic to a super-regional power during the 2nd century BC and the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC.

===Roman Republic (5th to 1st centuries BC)===

The Republican period of Ancient Rome began with the overthrow of the Monarchy c. 509 BC and lasted more than 450 years until its subversion through a series of civil wars, into the Principate form of government and the Imperial period. During the half millennium of the Republic, Rome increased from a regional power of the Latium to the dominant force in Italy and beyond. The unification of Italy by the Romans was a gradual process, brought about by a series of conflicts of the 4th and 3rd centuries, the Samnite Wars, Latin War, and Pyrrhic War. Roman victory in the Punic Wars and Macedonian Wars established Rome as a super-regional power by the 2nd century BC, followed by the acquisition of Greece and Asia Minor. This tremendous increase of power was accompanied by economic instability and social unrest, resulting in the Catiline conspiracy, the Social War and the First Triumvirate, and finally the transformation to the Roman Empire during the latter half of the 1st century BC.

=== Roman Empire (1st century BC to 5th century AD) ===

The precise end of the Republic is disputed by modern historians; Roman citizens of the time did not recognize that the Republic had ceased to exist. The early Julio-Claudian Emperors maintained that the &quot;res publica&quot; still existed, albeit protected by their extraordinary powers, and would eventually return to its earlier Republican form. The Roman state continued to term itself a &quot;res publica&quot; as long as it continued to use Latin as its official language.

Rome acquired imperial character &quot;de facto&quot; from the 130s BC with the acquisition of Cisalpine Gaul, Illyria, Greece and Hispania, and definitely with the addition of Iudaea, Asia Minor and Gaul during the 1st century BC. At the time of the empire&#x27;s maximal extension during the reign of Trajan (AD 117), Rome controlled the entire Mediterranean as well as Gaul, parts of Germania and Britannia, the Balkans, Dacia, Asia Minor, the Caucasus, and Mesopotamia.

Culturally, the Roman Empire was significantly Hellenized, but also incorporated syncretic &quot;eastern&quot; traditions, such as Mithraism, Gnosticism, and most notably Christianity.

Classical Rome had vast differences within their family life compared to the Greeks. Fathers had great power over their children, and husbands over their wives. In fact, the word family, &quot;familia&quot; in Latin, actually referred to those who were subject to the authority of a male head of household. This included non-related members such as slaves and servants. By marriage, both men and women shared property. Divorce was allowed first during the first century BC and could be done by either man or woman.

===Late antiquity (4th to 6th centuries AD)===

The Roman Empire began to weaken as a result of the crisis of the third century. During Late antiquity Christianity became increasingly popular, finally ousting the Roman imperial cult with the Theodosian decrees of 393. Successive invasions of Germanic tribes finalized the
weakening of the Western Roman Empire during the 5th century, while the Eastern Roman Empire persisted throughout the Middle Ages, in a state called Romania by its citizens, and designated the Byzantine Empire by later historians. Hellenistic philosophy was succeeded by continued development of Platonism and Epicureanism, with Neoplatonism in due course influencing the theology of the Christian Church Fathers.

Many writers have attempted to name a specific date for the symbolic &quot;end&quot; of antiquity, with the most prominent dates being the deposing of the last Western Roman Emperor in 476, the closing of the last Platonic Academy in Athens by the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I in 529, and the conquest of much of the Mediterranean by the new Muslim faith from 634 to 718. These Muslim conquests, of Syria (637), Egypt (639), Cyprus (654), North Africa (665), Hispania (718), Southern Gaul (720), Crete (820), and Sicily (827), Malta (870), as well as the sieges of the Eastern Roman capital (first in 674–78 and then in 717–18) severed the economic, cultural, and political links that had traditionally united the classical cultures around the Mediterranean, ending antiquity (see Pirenne Thesis).

The original Roman Senate continued to express decrees into the late 6th century, and the last Eastern Roman emperor to use Latin as the language of his court in Constantinople was emperor Maurice, who reigned until 602. The overthrow of Maurice by his mutinying Danube army commanded by Phocas resulted in the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and the weakening of Balkan and Greek urban culture (resulting in the flight of Balkan Latin speakers to the mountains, see Origin of the Romanians), and also provoked the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 in which all the great eastern cities except Constantinople were lost. The resulting turmoil did not end until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century finalized the irreversible loss of all the largest Eastern Roman imperial cities besides the capital itself. The emperor Heraclius in Constantinople, who reigned during this period, conducted his court in Greek, not Latin, though Greek had always been an administrative language of the eastern Roman regions. Eastern-Western associations weakened with the ending of the Byzantine Papacy.

The Eastern Roman empire&#x27;s capital city Constantinople remained the only unconquered large urban site of the original Roman empire, as well as being the largest city in Europe. Yet many classical books, sculptures, and technologies survived there along with classical Roman cuisine and scholarly traditions, well into the Middle Ages, when much of it was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by visiting Western crusaders. Indeed, the inhabitants of Constantinople continued to refer to themselves as Romans, as did their eventual conquerors in 1453, the Ottomans (see Romaioi and Rûm.) The classical scholarship and culture that was still preserved in Constantinople were brought by refugees fleeing its conquest in 1453 and helped to begin the Renaissance (see Greek scholars in the Renaissance).

Ultimately, it was a slow, complex, and graduated change of the socio-economic structure in European history that resulted in the changeover between classical antiquity and medieval society and no specific date can truly exemplify that.

== Political revivalism ==
In politics, the late Roman conception of the Empire as a universal state, commanded by one supreme divinely appointed ruler, united with Christianity as a universal religion likewise headed by a supreme patriarch, proved very influential, even after the disappearance of imperial authority in the west. This tendency reached its maximum when Charlemagne was crowned &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; in the year 800, an act which resulted in the formation of the Holy Roman Empire. The notion that an emperor is a monarch who outranks a king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state the jurisdiction of which extended through the entire civilized western world.

That model continued to exist in Constantinople for the entirety of the Middle Ages, where the Byzantine Emperor was considered the sovereign of the entire Christian world. The Patriarch of Constantinople was the Empire&#x27;s highest-ranked cleric, but even he was subordinate to the emperor, who was &quot;God&#x27;s Vicegerent on Earth&quot;. The Greek-speaking Byzantines and their descendants continued to call themselves &quot;Romioi&quot; until the creation of a new Greek state in 1832.

After the capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Russian Czars (a title derived from &quot;Caesar)&quot; claimed the Byzantine legacy as the champion of Orthodoxy; Moscow was described as the &quot;Third Rome&quot;, and the Czars ruled as divinely appointed Emperors into the 20th century.

Despite the fact that the Western Roman secular authority disappeared entirely in Europe, it still left traces. The Papacy and the Catholic Church in particular maintained Latin language, culture, and literacy for centuries; to this day the popes are termed &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; which during the classical period was a title belonging to the emperor, and the ideal of Christendom continued the legacy of a united European civilization even after its political unity had ended.

The political idea of an Emperor in the West to match the Emperor in the East continued after the Western Roman Empire&#x27;s collapse; it was revived by the coronation of Charlemagne in 800; the self-described Holy Roman Empire ruled central Europe until 1806.

The Renaissance idea that the classical Roman virtues had been lost as a result of medievalism was especially powerful in European politics of the 18th and 19th centuries. Reverence for Roman republicanism was strong among the Founding Fathers of the United States and the Latin American revolutionaries; the Americans described their new government as a &quot;republic&quot; (from &quot;res publica&quot;) and gave it a &quot;Senate&quot; and a &quot;President&quot; (another Latin term), rather than use available English terms like &quot;commonwealth&quot; or &quot;parliament&quot;.

Similarly in Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, republicanism and Roman martial virtues were promoted by the state, as can be seen in the architecture of the Panthéon, the Arc de Triomphe, and the paintings of Jacques-Louis David. During the revolution, France transitioned from kingdom to republic to dictatorship to Empire (complete with Imperial Eagles) that the Romans had experienced centuries earlier.

== Cultural legacy ==

&quot;Classical antiquity&quot; is a general term for a long period of cultural history. Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods. &quot;Classical antiquity&quot; often refers to an idealized vision of later people, of what was, in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s words, &quot;the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome!&quot; During the 18th and 19th centuries AD, reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in Europe and the United States than it is now. Respect for the ancient people of Greece and Rome affected politics, philosophy, sculpture, literature, theatre, education, architecture, and sexuality.

Epic poetry in Latin continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century. John Milton and even Arthur Rimbaud received their first poetic educations in Latin. Genres like epic poetry, pastoral verse, and the frequent use of characters and themes from Greek mythology affected Western literature greatly. In architecture, there have been several Greek Revivals, which seem more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek. Washington, DC has many large marble buildings with façades made to look like Greek temples, with columns constructed in the classical orders of architecture.

The philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas was derived largely from that of Aristotle, despite the intervening change in religion from Hellenic Polytheism to Christianity. Greek and Roman authorities such as Hippocrates and Galen formed the basis of the practice of medicine even longer than Greek thought prevailed in philosophy. In the French theater, playwrights such as Molière and Racine wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the classical unities derived from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;. The desire to dance in a manner allegedly similar to the manner of the ancient Greeks caused Isadora Duncan to create her brand of ballet.

<doc id="252907" wikidata="Q5608611" url="?curid=252907" title="Grid chess">
<text>Grid chess is a chess variant invented by Walter Stead in 1953. It is played on a &quot;grid board&quot;. This is a normal 64-square chessboard with a grid of lines further dividing it into larger squares. A single additional rule governs Grid chess: for a move to be legal, the piece moved must cross at least one grid line.

Grid chess is also used in chess problems.
==Description==
Various arrangements of the grid have been tried, but the original, and by far the most popular, is that illustrated, which divides the board into sixteen 2×2 squares.

In the sample position, White can play either a3 or a4, but cannot move the b-pawn. Black cannot play ...Bd5 but can play any other bishop move – to put the bishop on d5, it will take two moves (for example, first ...Ba8, then ...Bd5). The white king is not in check from the queen, but would be, if the queen were to take a step back with ...Qe3. The white king cannot take the queen, although the white knight can. The black king, on the other hand, &quot;is&quot; in check from the rook on c8. Black cannot escape check as in standard chess with ...Ke7 or ...Kf7, as these moves do not cross a grid line. Black can play ...Kd7, however, and also ...Kd8, bringing the king into the same large square as the rook.

==Example problem==

It is possible to play entire games under Grid chess conditions, and a number of chess problems using Grid chess rules have also been composed. The one shown won first prize in the first Grid chess problem tournament. It is by H. Ternblad and was published in &quot;Fairy Chess Review&quot;, 1954. It is a helpmate in four (Black moves first and cooperates with White to checkmate him within four moves). The solution:

:1. Ke2 Bc4+ 2. Kd3
This brings the king into the same large square as the bishop, and so escapes the check.

:2... Bxb5+
Withdrawing the bishop over a grid line gives check again.

:3. Ke4 Bc6+ 4. Kd5
Two kings can coexist next to each other so long as they are in the same large square.

:4... Bxb7

This problem displays attractive correspondence between the paths taken by the king and bishop. There is a zigzagging path the black king must take to reach d5: the straightforward route Kd1–d2–d3–d4–d5 is not possible because two of the moves do not cross grid lines, and Kd1–e2–e3–d4–d5 is not possible because on d4 the king is checked by White&#x27;s king.

<text>NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission was a robotic space mission involving two Mars rovers, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;, exploring the planet Mars. It began in 2003 with the launch of the two rovers to explore the Martian surface and geology; both landed on Mars at separate locations in January 2004. Both rovers far outlived their planned missions of 90 Martian solar days: MER-A &quot;Spirit&quot; was active until March 22, 2010, while MER-B &quot;Opportunity&quot; was active until June 10, 2018.

==Objectives==
The mission&#x27;s scientific objective was to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The mission is part of NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Program, which includes three previous successful landers: the two Viking program landers in 1976 and Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997.

The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission were to:

*Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity. In particular, samples sought include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as precipitation, evaporation, sedimentary cementation, or hydrothermal activity.
*Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.
*Determine what geologic processes have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.
*Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey Martian geology from orbit.
*Search for iron-containing minerals, and to identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.
*Characterize the mineralogy and textures of rocks and soils to determine the processes that created them.
*Search for geological clues to the environmental conditions that existed when liquid water was present.
*Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.

The total cost of building, launching, landing and operating the rovers on the surface for the initial 90-sol primary mission was US$820 million. Each rover received five mission extensions, as they continued to function past their initially planned duration. The fifth mission extension was granted in October 2007, and ran to the end of 2009. The total cost of the first four mission extensions was $104 million, and the fifth mission extension cost at least $20 million. The mission was managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which designed, built, and operated the rovers.

In recognition of the vast amount of scientific information amassed by both rovers, two asteroids have been named in their honor: 37452 Spirit and 39382 Opportunity.

==Mission timeline==
=== Launch and landing ===

The MER-A (&quot;Spirit&quot;) and MER-B (&quot;Opportunity&quot;) were launched on June 10, 2003 and July 7, 2003, respectively. Though both probes launched on Boeing Delta II 7925-9.5 rockets from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 17 (CCAFS SLC-17), MER-B was on the heavy version of that launch vehicle, needing the extra energy for Trans-Mars injection. The launch vehicles were integrated onto pads right next to each other, with MER-A on CCAFS SLC-17A and MER-B on CCAFS SLC-17B. The dual pads allowed for working the 15- and 21-day planetary launch periods close together; the last possible launch day for MER-A was June 19, 2003 and the first day for MER-B was June 25, 2003. NASA&#x27;s Launch Services Program managed the launch of both spacecraft.

The probes landed in January 2004 in widely separated equatorial locations on Mars. On January 21, 2004, the Deep Space Network lost contact with &quot;Spirit&quot;, for reasons originally thought to be related to a flare shower over Australia. The rover transmitted a message with no data, but later that day missed another communications session with the Mars Global Surveyor. The next day, JPL received a beep from the rover, indicating that it was in fault mode. On January 23, the flight team succeeded in making the rover send. The fault was believed to have been caused by an error in the rover&#x27;s flash memory subsystem. The rover did not perform any scientific activities for ten days, while engineers updated its software and ran tests. The problem was corrected by reformatting &quot;Spirit&quot; flash memory and using a software patch to avoid memory overload; &quot;Opportunity&quot; was also upgraded with the patch as a precaution. &quot;Spirit&quot; returned to full scientific operations by February 5. Both rovers&#x27; missions were initially just 90-sol-long.

On March 23, 2004, a news conference was held announcing &quot;major discoveries&quot; of evidence of past liquid water on the Martian surface. A delegation of scientists showed pictures and data revealing a stratified pattern and cross bedding in the rocks of the outcrop inside a crater in Meridiani Planum, landing site of MER-B, &quot;Opportunity&quot;. This suggested that water once flowed in the region. The irregular distribution of chlorine and bromine also suggests that the place was once the shoreline of a salty sea, now evaporated.

===Mission extensions===

On April 8, 2004, NASA announced that it was extending the mission life of the rovers from three to eight months. It immediately provided additional funding of US$15 million through September, and $2.8 million per month for continuing operations. Later that month, &quot;Opportunity&quot; arrived at Endurance crater, taking about five days to drive the 200 meters. NASA announced on September 22 that it was extending the mission life of the rovers for another six months. &quot;Opportunity&quot; was to leave Endurance crater, visit its discarded heat shield, and proceed to Victoria crater. &quot;Spirit&quot; was to attempt to climb to the top of the Columbia Hills.

With the two rovers still functioning well, NASA later announced another 18-month extension of the mission to September 2006. &quot;Opportunity&quot; was to visit the &quot;Etched Terrain&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot; was to climb a rocky slope toward the top of Husband Hill. On August 21, 2005, &quot;Spirit&quot; reached the summit of Husband Hill after 581 sols and a journey of .

&quot;Spirit&#x27;s&quot; front right wheel ceased working on March 13, 2006, while the rover was moving itself to McCool Hill. Its drivers attempted to drag the dead wheel behind &quot;Spirit&quot;, but this only worked until reaching an impassable sandy area on the lower slopes. Drivers directed &quot;Spirit&quot; to a smaller sloped feature, dubbed &quot;Low Ridge Haven&quot;, where it spent the long Martian winter, waiting for spring and increased solar power levels suitable for driving. That September, &quot;Opportunity&quot; reached the rim of Victoria crater, and Spaceflight Now reported that NASA had extended mission for the two rovers through September 2007. On February 6, 2007, &quot;Opportunity&quot; became the first spacecraft to traverse on the surface of Mars.

In July 2007, during the fourth mission extension, Martian dust storms blocked sunlight to the rovers and threatened the ability of the craft to gather energy through their solar panels, causing engineers to fear that one or both of them might be permanently disabled. However, the dust storms lifted, allowing them to resume operations.

&quot;Opportunity&quot; was poised to enter Victoria Crater from its perch on the rim of Duck Bay on June 28, 2007, but due to extensive dust storms, it was delayed until the dust had cleared and power returned to safe levels. Two months later, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; resumed driving after hunkering down during raging dust storms that limited solar power to a level that nearly caused the permanent failure of both rovers.

On October 1, 2007, both &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; entered their fifth mission extension that extended operations into 2009, allowing the rovers to have spent five years exploring the Martian surface, pending their continued survival.

On August 26, 2008, &quot;Opportunity&quot; began its three-day climb out of Victoria crater amidst concerns that power spikes, similar to those seen on &quot;Spirit&quot; before the failure of its right-front wheel, might prevent it from ever being able to leave the crater if a wheel failed. Project scientist Bruce Banerdt also said, &quot;We&#x27;ve done everything we entered Victoria Crater to do and more.&quot; &quot;Opportunity&quot; will return to the plains in order to characterize Meridiani Planum&#x27;s vast diversity of rocks—some of which may have been blasted out of craters such as Victoria. The rover had been exploring Victoria Crater since September 11, 2007. As of January 2009, the two rovers had collectively sent back 250,000 images and traveled over .

After driving about since it left Victoria crater, &quot;Opportunity&quot; first saw the rim of Endeavour crater on March 7, 2009. It passed the mark along the way on sol 1897. Meanwhile, at Gusev crater, &quot;Spirit&quot; was dug in deep into the Martian sand, much as &quot;Opportunity&quot; was at Purgatory Dune in 2005.

On January 26, 2010, after six years on Mars, NASA announced that &quot;Spirit&quot; would be used as a stationary research platform, after several months of unsuccessful attempts to free the rover from soft sand.

NASA announced on March 24, 2010, that &quot;Opportunity&quot;, which had an estimated remaining drive distance of to Endeavour Crater, had traveled over since the start of its mission. Each rover was designed with a mission driving distance goal of just 600 meters. 

In March 2010 it was announced that &quot;Spirit&quot; may have gone into hibernation for the Martian winter and might not wake up again for months. On May 22, 2011, NASA cease attempts to contact with &quot;Spirit&quot;, which had been stuck in a sand trap for two years. The last successful communication with the rover was on March 22, 2010. The final transmission to &quot;Spirit&quot; was on May 25, 2011.

On May 16, 2013, NASA announced that &quot;Opportunity&quot; had driven further than any other NASA vehicle on a world other than Earth. After &quot;Opportunity&#x27;s&quot; total odometry went over , the rover surpassed the total distance driven by the Apollo 17 Lunar Roving Vehicle. And on July 28, 2014, &quot;Opportunity&quot; had driven further than any other vehicle on a world other than Earth. &quot;Opportunity&quot; covered over , surpassing the total distance of driven by the Lunokhod 2 lunar rover, the previous record-holder. On March 23, 2015, &quot;Opportunity&quot; had driven the full distance of a marathon, with a finish time of roughly 11 years and 2 months.

On January 24, 2014, NASA reported that then-current studies by the remaining rover, &quot;Opportunity&quot;, as well as by the newer Mars Science Laboratory rover &quot;Curiosity&quot; would now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars was then switched to a primary NASA objective.

In June 2018, &quot;Opportunity&quot; was caught in a global-scale dust storm and the rover&#x27;s solar panels were not able to generate enough power, with the last contact on June 10, 2018. NASA resumed sending commands after the dust storm subsided but the rover remained silent, possibly due to a catastrophic failure or a layer of dust covering its solar panels. A press conference was held on February 13, 2019, announcing that after numerous attempts to contact &quot;Opportunity&quot;, with no response since June 2018, NASA declared the &quot;Opportunity&quot; mission over, which also drew the 16-year long Mars Exploration Rover mission to a close.

==Spacecraft design==
The Mars Exploration Rover was designed to be stowed atop a Delta II rocket. Each spacecraft consists of several components:
* Rover: 
* Lander: 
* Backshell / Parachute: 
* Heat Shield: 
* Cruise Stage: 
* Propellant: 
* Instruments: 
Total mass is .

===Cruise stage===
The cruise stage is the component of the spacecraft that is used for travel from Earth to Mars. It is very similar to the Mars Pathfinder in design and is approximately 2.65 meters (8.7 feet) in diameter and tall, including the entry vehicle (see below).

The primary structure is aluminium with an outer ring of ribs covered by the solar panels, which are about in diameter. Divided into five sections, the solar arrays can provide up to 600 watts of power near Earth and 300 W at Mars.

Heaters and multi-layer insulation keep the electronics &quot;warm&quot;. A freon system removes heat from the flight computer and communications hardware inside the rover so they do not overheat. Cruise avionics systems allow the flight computer to interface with other electronics, such as the Sun sensors, star scanner and heaters.

====Navigation====
The star scanner (without a backup system) and Sun sensor allowed the spacecraft to know its orientation in space by analyzing the position of the Sun and other stars in relation to itself. Sometimes the craft could be slightly off course; this was expected, given the 500-million-kilometer (320 million mile) journey. Thus navigators planned up to six trajectory correction maneuvers, along with health checks.

To ensure the spacecraft arrived at Mars in the right place for its landing, two light-weight, aluminium-lined tanks carried about 31 kg (about 68 lb) of hydrazine propellant. Along with cruise guidance and control systems, the propellant allowed navigators to keep the spacecraft on course. Burns and pulse firings of the propellant allowed three types of maneuvers:
* An axial burn uses pairs of thrusters to change spacecraft velocity;
* A lateral burn uses two &quot;thruster clusters&quot; (four thrusters per cluster) to move the spacecraft &quot;sideways&quot; through seconds-long pulses;
* Pulse mode firing uses coupled thruster pairs for spacecraft precession maneuvers (turns).

====Communication====
The spacecraft used a high-frequency X band radio wavelength to communicate, which allowed for less power and smaller antennas than many older craft, which used S band.

Navigators sent commands through two antennas on the cruise stage: a cruise low-gain antenna mounted inside the inner ring, and a cruise medium-gain antenna in the outer ring. The low-gain antenna was used close to Earth. It is omni-directional, so the transmission power that reached Earth fell faster with increasing distance. As the craft moved closer to Mars, the Sun and Earth moved closer in the sky as viewed from the craft, so less energy reached Earth. The spacecraft then switched to the medium-gain antenna, which directed the same amount of transmission power into a tighter beam toward Earth.

During flight, the spacecraft was spin-stabilized with a spin rate of two revolutions per minute (rpm). Periodic updates kept antennas pointed toward Earth and solar panels toward the Sun.

===Aeroshell===

The aeroshell maintained a protective covering for the lander during the seven-month voyage to Mars. Together with the lander and the rover, it constituted the &quot;entry vehicle&quot;. Its main purpose was to protect the lander and the rover inside it from the intense heat of entry into the thin Martian atmosphere. It was based on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Viking designs.

;Parts
The aeroshell was made of two main parts: a heat shield and a backshell. The heat shield was flat and brownish, and protected the lander and rover during entry into the Martian atmosphere and acted as the first aerobrake for the spacecraft. The backshell was large, cone-shaped and painted white. It carried the parachute and several components used in later stages of entry, descent, and landing, including:

* A parachute (stowed at the bottom of the backshell);
* The backshell electronics and batteries that fire off pyrotechnic devices like separation nuts, rockets and the parachute mortar;
* A Litton LN-200 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which monitors and reports the orientation of the backshell as it swings under the parachute;
* Three large solid rocket motors called RAD rockets (Rocket Assisted Descent), each providing about a ton of force (10 kilonewtons) for nearly 4 seconds;
* Three small solid rockets called TIRS (mounted so that they aim horizontally out the sides of the backshell) that provide a small horizontal kick to the backshell to help orient the backshell more vertically during the main RAD rocket burn.

;Composition
Built by Lockheed Martin Space in Denver, Colorado, the aeroshell is made of an aluminium honeycomb structure sandwiched between graphite-epoxy face sheets. The outside of the aeroshell is covered with a layer of phenolic honeycomb. This honeycomb is filled with an ablative material (also called an &quot;ablator&quot;), that dissipates heat generated by atmospheric friction.

The ablator itself is a blend of cork wood, binder and many tiny silica glass spheres. It was invented for the heat shields flown on the Viking Mars lander missions. A similar technology was used in the first US crewed space missions Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. It was specially formulated to react chemically with the Martian atmosphere during entry and carry heat away, leaving a hot wake of gas behind the vehicle. The vehicle slowed from in about a minute, producing about 60 m/s2 (6 &quot;g&quot;) of acceleration on the lander and rover.

The backshell and heat shield are made of the same materials, but the heat shield has a thicker, , layer of the ablator. Instead of being painted, the backshell was covered with a very thin aluminized PET film blanket to protect it from the cold of deep space. The blanket vaporized during entry into the Martian atmosphere.

===Parachute===

The parachute helped slow the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing. It is located in the backshell.

;Design
The 2003 parachute design was part of a long-term Mars parachute technology development effort and is based on the designs and experience of the Viking and Pathfinder missions. The parachute for this mission is 40% larger than Pathfinder&#x27;s because the largest load for the Mars Exploration Rover is 80 to 85 kilonewtons (kN) or when the parachute fully inflates. By comparison, Pathfinder&#x27;s inflation loads were approximately 35 kN (about 8,000 lbf). The parachute was designed and constructed in South Windsor, Connecticut by Pioneer Aerospace, who also designed the parachute for the &quot;Stardust&quot; mission.

;Composition
The parachute is made of two durable, lightweight fabrics: polyester and nylon. A triple bridle made of Kevlar connects the parachute to the backshell.

The amount of space available on the spacecraft for the parachute was so small that the parachute had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly folded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the parachute. The parachute was loaded in a special structure that then applied a heavy weight to the parachute package several times. Before placing the parachute into the backshell, the parachute was heat set to sterilize it.

;Connected systems

After the parachute was deployed at an altitude of about above the surface, the heatshield was released using 6 separation nuts and push-off springs. The lander then separated from the backshell and &quot;rappelled&quot; down a metal tape on a centrifugal braking system built into one of the lander petals. The slow descent down the metal tape placed the lander in position at the end of another bridle (tether), made of a nearly long braided Zylon. Zylon is a fiber material, similar to Kevlar, that is sewn in a webbing pattern (like shoelace material) to make it stronger. The Zylon bridle provides space for airbag deployment, distance from the solid rocket motor exhaust stream, and increased stability. The bridle incorporates an electrical harness that allows the firing of the solid rockets from the backshell as well as provides data from the backshell inertial measurement unit (which measures rate and tilt of the spacecraft) to the flight computer in the rover.

Because the atmospheric density of Mars is less than 1% of Earth&#x27;s, the parachute alone could not slow down the Mars Exploration Rover enough to ensure a safe, low landing speed. The spacecraft descent was assisted by rockets that brought the spacecraft to a dead stop above the Martian surface.

A radar altimeter unit was used to determine the distance to the Martian surface. The radar&#x27;s antenna was mounted at one of the lower corners of the lander tetrahedron. When the radar measurement showed the lander was the correct distance above the surface, the Zylon bridle was cut, releasing the lander from the parachute and backshell so that it was free and clear for landing. The radar data also enabled the timing sequence on airbag inflation and backshell RAD rocket firing.

===Airbags===

Airbags used in the Mars Exploration Rover mission are the same type that Mars Pathfinder used in 1997. They had to be strong enough to cushion the spacecraft if it landed on rocks or rough terrain and allow it to bounce across Mars&#x27; surface at highway speeds (about 100 km/h) after landing. The airbags had to be inflated seconds before touchdown and deflated once safely on the ground.

The airbags were made of Vectran, like those on Pathfinder. Vectran has almost twice the strength of other synthetic materials, such as Kevlar, and performs better in cold temperatures. Six 100 denier (10 mg/m) layers of Vectran protected one or two inner bladders of Vectran in 200 denier (20 mg/m). Using 100 denier (10 mg/m) leaves more fabric in the outer layers where it is needed, because there are more threads in the weave.

Each rover used four airbags with six lobes each, all of which were connected. Connection was important, since it helped abate some of the landing forces by keeping the bag system flexible and responsive to ground pressure. The airbags were not attached directly to the rover, but were held to it by ropes crisscrossing the bag structure. The ropes gave the bags shape, making inflation easier. While in flight, the bags were stowed along with three gas generators that are used for inflation.

===Lander===
The spacecraft lander is a protective shell that houses the rover, and together with the airbags, protects it from the forces of impact.

The lander is a tetrahedron shape, whose sides open like petals. It is strong and light, and made of beams and sheets. The beams consist of layers of graphite fiber woven into a fabric that is lighter than aluminium and more rigid than steel. Titanium fittings are glued and fitted onto the beams to allow it to be bolted together. The rover was held inside the lander by bolts and special nuts that were released after landing with small explosives.

====Uprighting====
After the lander stopped bouncing and rolling on the ground, it came to rest on the base of the tetrahedron or one of its sides. The sides then opened to make the base horizontal and the rover upright. The sides are connected to the base by hinges, each of which has a motor strong enough to lift the lander. The rover plus lander has a mass of about . The rover alone has a mass of about . The gravity on Mars is about 38% of Earth&#x27;s, so the motor does not need to be as powerful as it would on Earth.

The rover contains accelerometers to detect which way is down (toward the surface of Mars) by measuring the pull of gravity. The rover computer then commanded the correct lander petal to open to place the rover upright. Once the base petal was down and the rover was upright, the other two petals were opened.

The petals initially opened to an equally flat position, so all sides of the lander were straight and level. The petal motors are strong enough so that if two of the petals come to rest on rocks, the base with the rover would be held in place like a bridge above the ground. The base will hold at a level even with the height of the petals resting on rocks, making a straight flat surface throughout the length of the open, flattened lander. The flight team on Earth could then send commands to the rover to adjust the petals and create a safe path for the rover to drive off the lander and onto the Martian surface without dropping off a steep rock.

====Moving the payload onto Mars====

The moving of the rover off the lander is called the egress phase of the mission. The rover must avoid having its wheels caught in the airbag material or falling off a sharp incline. To help this, a retraction system on the petals slowly drags the airbags toward the lander before the petals open. Small ramps on the petals fan out to fill spaces between the petals. They cover uneven terrain, rock obstacles, and airbag material, and form a circular area from which the rover can drive off in more directions. They also lower the step that the rover must climb down. They are nicknamed &quot;batwings&quot;, and are made of Vectran cloth.

About three hours were allotted to retract the airbags and deploy the lander petals.

==Rover design==
The rovers are six-wheeled, solar-powered robots that stand high, wide and long. They weigh , of which is the wheel and suspension system.

The main box-like chassis forms the Warm Electronics Box (WEB).

===Drive system===
Each rover has six aluminium wheels mounted on a rocker-bogie suspension system, similar to that on Sojourner, that ensures wheels remain on the ground while driving over rough terrain. The design reduces the range of motion of the rover body by half, and allows the rover to go over obstacles or through holes (depressions) that are more than a wheel diameter () in size. The rover wheels are designed with integral compliant flexures which provide shock absorption during movement. Additionally, the wheels have cleats which provide grip for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks.

Each wheel has its own drive motor. The two front and two rear wheels each have individual steering motors. This allows the vehicle to turn in place, a full revolution, and to swerve and curve, making arcing turns. The motors for the rovers have been designed by the Swiss company Maxon Motor. The rover is designed to withstand a tilt of 45 degrees in any direction without overturning. However, the rover is programmed through its &quot;fault protection limits&quot; in its hazard avoidance software to avoid exceeding tilts of 30 degrees.

Each rover can spin one of its front wheels in place to grind deep into the terrain. It is to remain motionless while the digging wheel is spinning. The rovers have a top speed on flat hard ground of 50 mm/s (2 in/s). The average speed is 10 mm/s, because its hazard avoidance software causes it to stop every 10 seconds for 20 seconds to observe and understand the terrain into which it has driven.

===Power and electronic systems===

When fully illuminated, the rover triplejunction solar arrays generate about 140 watts for up to four hours per Martian day (sol). The rover needs about 100 watts to drive. Its power system includes two rechargeable lithium ion batteries weighing each, that provide energy when the sun is not shining, especially at night. Over time, the batteries will degrade and will not be able to recharge to full capacity.

It was thought that by the end of the 90-sol mission, the capability of the solar arrays to generate power would likely be reduced to about 50 watts. This was due to anticipated dust coverage on the solar arrays, and the change in season. Over three Earth years later, however, the rovers&#x27; power supplies hovered between 300 watt-hours and 900 watt-hours per day, depending on dust coverage. Cleaning events (dust removal by wind) have occurred more often than NASA expected, keeping the arrays relatively free of dust and extending the life of the mission. During a 2007 global dust storm on Mars, both rovers experienced some of the lowest power of the mission; &quot;Opportunity&quot; dipped to 128 watt-hours. In November 2008, &quot;Spirit&quot; had overtaken this low-energy record with a production of 89 watt-hours, due to dust storms in the region of Gusev crater.

The rovers run a VxWorks embedded operating system on a radiation-hardened 20 MHz RAD6000 CPU with 128 MB of DRAM with error detection and correction and 3 MB of EEPROM. Each rover also has 256 MB of flash memory. To survive during the various mission phases, the rover&#x27;s vital instruments must stay within a temperature of −40 °C to +40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F). At night, the rovers are heated by eight radioisotope heater units (RHU), which each continuously generate 1 W of thermal energy from the decay of radioisotopes, along with electrical heaters that operate only when necessary. A sputtered gold film and a layer of silica aerogel are used for insulation.

===Communication===
The rover has an X band low-gain and an X band high-gain antenna for communications to and from the Earth, as well as an ultra high frequency monopole antenna for relay communications. The low-gain antenna is omnidirectional, and transmits data at a low rate to Deep Space Network antennas on Earth. The high-gain antenna is directional and steerable, and can transmit data to Earth at a higher rate. The rovers use the UHF monopole and its CE505 radio to communicate with spacecraft orbiting Mars, the Mars Odyssey and (before its failure) the Mars Global Surveyor (already more than 7.6 terabits of data were transferred using its Mars Relay antenna and Mars Orbiter Camera&#x27;s memory buffer of 12 MB). Since MRO went into orbit around Mars, the landers have also used it as a relay asset. Most of the lander data is relayed to Earth through Odyssey and MRO. The orbiters can receive rover signals at a much higher data rate than the Deep Space Network can, due to the much shorter distances from rover to orbiter. The orbiters then quickly relay the rover data to the Earth using their large and high-powered antennas.

===Scientific instrumentation===
Each rover has nine cameras, which produce 1024-pixel by 1024-pixel images at 12 bits per pixel, but most navigation camera images and image thumbnails are truncated to 8 bits per pixel to conserve memory and transmission time. All images are then compressed using ICER before being stored and sent to Earth. Navigation, thumbnail, and many other image types are compressed to approximately 0.8 to 1.1 bits/pixel. Lower bit rates (less than 0.5-bit/pixel) are used for certain wavelengths of multi-color panoramic images. ICER is based on wavelets, and was designed specifically for deep-space applications. It produces progressive compression, both lossless and lossy, and incorporates an error-containment scheme to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel. It outperforms the lossy JPEG image compressor and the lossless Rice compressor used by the Mars Pathfinder mission.

Several cameras and instruments were mounted on the Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA):
* Panoramic Cameras (Pancam), two cameras with color filter wheels for determining the texture, color, mineralogy, and structure of the local terrain. Two cameras work in combination to take detailed, multi-wavelength, 3-D panoramic pictures of the Martian landscape surrounding the rover, sky and the Sun. There are 30 cm between two cameras. Each camera had filters for 400-1100 nm (near-UV to near-IR), with maximum image resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels.
* Navigation Cameras (Navcam), two cameras that have larger fields of view but lower resolution and are monochromatic, for navigation and driving.
* A periscope assembly for the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), an infrared spectrometer used to determine the mineralogy of rocks and soils from a distance by detecting their patterns of thermal radiation. It was specially tuned to look for minerals formed in water, like carbonates and clays. The periscope assembly features two beryllium fold mirrors, a shroud that closes to minimize dust contamination in the assembly, and stray-light rejection baffles that are strategically placed within the graphite epoxy tubes. The Mini-TES was built by Arizona State University.

The cameras were mounted 1.5 meters high on the Pancam Mast Assembly, which allows 360-degree rotation. The PMA is deployed via the Mast Deployment Drive (MDD). The Azimuth Drive, mounted directly above the MDD, turned the assembly horizontally a whole revolution with signals transmitted through a rolling tape configuration. The camera drive points the cameras in elevation, almost straight up or down. A third motor points the Mini-TES fold mirrors and protective shroud, up to 30° above the horizon and 50° below. 

Four monochromatic Hazard Avoidance Cameras (Hazcams) were mounted on the rover&#x27;s body, two in front and two behind. The rover used pairs of Hazcam images to map out the shape of the terrain as far as 3 meters (10 feet) in front of it, in a &quot;wedge&quot; shape that is over 4 meters wide at the farthest distance.

The instrument deployment device (IDD), also called the rover arm. The arm has a turret shaped like a cross that holds several instruments. The arm can spin through a 350-degree turning range and rotate vertically through 340-degree range. The arm has three joint and a maximum reach of 90 centimeters.
* Mössbauer spectrometer (MB) MIMOS II, developed by Göstar Klingelhöfer at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, was used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils. One Mössbauer measurement took about 12 hours.
* Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS), developed by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, was used to determines the elemental chemistry of rocks and soils using alpha particles and X-rays. Most APXS measurements were taken at night and required at least 10 hours of accumulation time.
* Magnet array were used for collecting magnetic dust particles. There were seven magnets on each rover: four magnets were carried by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT); two magnets (one capture magnet and one filter magnet) were mounted on the front of the rover; another magnet (sweep magnet) was mounted on the top of the rover deck in view of the Pancam. The particles were analyzed by the Mössbauer Spectrometer and X-ray Spectrometer to help determine the ratio of magnetic particles to non-magnetic particles and the composition of magnetic minerals in airborne dust and rocks that have been ground by the Rock Abrasion Tool.
* Microscopic Imager (MI) for obtaining close-up, black-and-white high-resolution images of rocks and soils, with maximum resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels. Development was led by Ken Herkenhoff&#x27;s team at the U.S. Geological Survey Astrogeology Research Program. The Microscopic Imager is a combination of a microscope and a CCD camera.
* Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT), developed by Honeybee Robotics, for removing dusty and weathered rock surfaces and exposing fresh material for examination by instruments on board. It was able to create a hole around 2 inches (45 millimeters) in diameter and 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) deep in a rock, and able to grind through hard volcanic rock in about two hours. RAT used three electric motors to drive rotating grinding teeth into the surface of a rock. Two grinding wheels rotate at high speeds. These wheels also rotate around each other at a much slower speed so that the two grinding wheels sweep the entire cutting area.

The robotic arm was able to place instruments directly up against rock and soil targets of interest.

==Naming of &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;==

The &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; rovers were named through a student essay competition. The winning entry was by Sofi Collis, a third-grade Russian-American student from Arizona.
I used to live in an orphanage. It was dark and cold and lonely. At night, I looked up at the sparkly sky and felt better. I dreamed I could fly there. In America, I can make all my dreams come true. Thank you for the &#x27;Spirit&#x27; and the &#x27;Opportunity.&#x27;
— Sofi Collis, age 9
Prior to this, during the development and building of the rovers, they were known as MER-1 Rover 1 (&quot;Opportunity&quot;) and MER-2 Rover 2 (&quot;Spirit&quot;). Internally, NASA also uses the mission designations MER-A (&quot;Spirit&quot;) and MER-B (&quot;Opportunity&quot;) based on the order of landing on Mars.

==Test rovers==

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory maintains a pair of rovers, the &quot;Surface System Test-Beds&quot; (SSTB) at its location in Pasadena for testing and modeling of situations on Mars. One test rover, SSTB1, weighing approximately , is fully instrumented and nearly identical to &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;. Another test version, &quot;SSTB-Lite&quot;, is identical in size and drive characteristics but does not include all instruments. It weighs , much closer to the weight of &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; in the reduced gravity of Mars. These rovers were used in 2009 for a simulation of the incident in which &quot;Spirit&quot; became trapped in soft soil.

==Planetary science findings==
===&quot;Spirit&quot; Landing Site, Gusev Crater===

====Plains====
Although the Gusev crater appears from orbital images to be a dry lakebed, the observations from the surface show the interior plains mostly filled with debris. The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).
Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from meteorites.
Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).

====Dust====
The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, &quot;Spirit&quot; found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic. The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.

====Columbia Hills====
As the rover climbed above the plains onto the Columbia Hills, the mineralogy that was seen changed. Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six are: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are named after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other. Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids.
They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills&#x27; rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and sulfates.
The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.

The Clovis group is especially interesting because the Mössbauer spectrometer (MB) detected goethite in it. Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills&#x27;s rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence,
although the rocks probably once contained much olivine. Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form.
Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrate (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed sulfur and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.
One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron.
Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe3+ form.
Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure silica were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.

After &quot;Spirit&quot; stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or Mini-TES and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called &quot;Comanche.&quot;

&quot;Spirit&quot; found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.

===&quot;Opportunity&quot; Landing Site, Meridiani Planum===
The &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover landed in a small crater, dubbed &quot;Eagle&quot;, on the flat plains of Meridiani. The plains of the landing site were characterized by the presence of a large number of small spherules, spherical concretions that were tagged &quot;blueberries&quot; by the science team, which were found both loose on the surface, and also embedded in the rock. These proved to have a high concentration of the mineral hematite, and showed the signature of being formed in an aqueous environment. The layered bedrock revealed in the crater walls showed signs of being sedimentary in nature, and compositional and microscopic-imagery analysis showed this to be primarily with composition of Jarosite, a ferrous sulfate mineral that is characteristically an evaporite that is the residue from the evaporation of a salty pond or sea.

The mission has provided substantial evidence of past water activity on Mars. In addition to investigating the &quot;water hypothesis&quot;, &quot;Opportunity&quot; has also obtained astronomical observations and atmospheric data.
The extended mission took the rover across the plains to a series of larger craters in the south, with the arrival at the edge of a 25-km diameter crater, Endeavour Crater, eight years after landing. The orbital spectroscopy of this crater rim show the signs of phyllosilicate rocks, indicative of older sedimentary deposits.

<text>J.D. Edwards World Solution Company or JD Edwards, abbreviated JDE, was an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software company, whose namesake ERP system is still sold under ownership by Oracle Corporation. JDE&#x27;s products included &quot;World&quot; for IBM AS/400 minicomputers (the users using a computer terminal or terminal emulator), &quot;OneWorld&quot; for their proprietary Configurable Network Computing architecture (a client–server fat client), and JD Edwards &quot;EnterpriseOne&quot; (a web-based thin client). The company was founded March 1977 in Denver, by Jack Thompson, C.T.P. &quot;Chuck&quot; Hintze, Dan Gregory, and C. Edward &quot;Ed&quot; McVaney.

In June 2003, JD Edwards agreed to sell itself to PeopleSoft for $1.8 billion. Within days, Oracle launched a hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft sans JD Edwards. PeopleSoft went ahead with the JD Edwards acquisition anyway, and in 2005, Oracle Corporation finally took ownership of the combined JD Edwards-PeopleSoft organization. As of 2020, Oracle continues to sell and actively support both ERP packages, branded now as JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and JD Edwards World.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
Ed McVaney originally trained as an engineer at the University of Nebraska, and in 1964 was employed by Western Electric, then by Peat Marwick, and moved to Denver, in 1968, and later became a partner at Alexander Grant where he hired Jack Thompson and Dan Gregory. Around that time he was realizing that, in his words, &quot;The culture of a public accounting firm is the antithesis of developing software. The idea of spending time on something that you’re not getting paid for—software development—they just could not stomach that.&quot; McVaney felt that accounting clients did not understand what was required for software development, and decided to start his own firm.

&quot;JD Edwards&quot; was founded in 1977 by Jack Thompson, Dan Gregory, and Ed McVaney; the company&#x27;s name is drawn from the initials &quot;J&quot; for Jack, &quot;D&quot; for Dan, and &quot;Edwards&quot; for Ed. McVaney took a salary cut from $44,000 to $36,000 to ensure initial funding. Start-up clients included McCoy Sales, a wholesale distribution company in Denver, and Cincinnati Milacron, a maker of machine tools. The business received a $75,000 contract to develop wholesale distribution system software and a $50,000 contract with the Colorado Highway Department to develop governmental and construction cost accounting systems. The first international client was Shell Oil Company. Shell Oil implemented JD Edwards in Canada and then in Cameroon. Gregory flew to Shell Oil in Douala, Cameroon to install the company&#x27;s first international, multi-national, multi-currency client software system.

===Enterprise Resource Planning concept developed===
As the majority of JD Edwards&#x27;s customers were medium-sized companies, clients did not have large-scale software implementations. There was a basic business need for all accounting to be tightly integrated. As McVaney would explain in 2002, integrated systems were created precisely because &quot;you can’t go into a moderate-sized company and just put in a payroll. You have to put in a payroll and job cost, general ledger, inventory, fixed assets and the whole thing. SAP had the same advantage that JD Edwards had because we worked on smaller companies, we were forced to see the whole broad picture.&quot; This requirement was relevant to both JDE clients in the US and Europe and their European competitor SAP, whose typical clients were much smaller than the American Fortune 500 firms. McVaney and his company developed what would be called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software in response to that business requirement.

===World ERP System launched===
The software ultimately sold was named JD Edwards WorldSoftware, popularly called World. Development began using System/34 and /36 minicomputers, changing course in the mid-1980s to the System/38, later switching to the AS/400 platform when it became available.

The company&#x27;s initial focus was on developing the accounting software needed for their clients. World was server-centric as well as multi-user; the users would access the system using one of several IBM computer terminals or &quot;green-screens&quot;. (Later on, users would run terminal emulator software on their personal computers).

As an ERP system, World comprised the three basic areas of expertise: functional/business analyst, programmer/software developer, and CNC/system administration.

===OneWorld ERP System launched===
By late 1996, JD Edwards delivered to its customers the result of a major corporate initiative: the software was now ported to platform-independent client–server systems. It was branded JD Edwards OneWorld, an entirely new product with a graphical user interface and a distributed computing model replacing the old server-centric model. The architecture JD Edwards had developed for this newer technology, called Configurable Network Computing or CNC, transparently shielded business applications from the servers that ran those same applications, the databases in which the data were stored, and the underlying operating system and hardware.
By first quarter 1998, JD Edwards had 26 OneWorld customers and was moving its medium-sized customers to the new client–server flavor of ERP. By second quarter 1998, JDE had 48 customers, and by 2001, the company had more than 600 customers using OneWorld, a fourfold increase over 2000.

The company became publicly listed on September 24, 1997, with vice-president Doug Massingill being promoted to chief executive officer, at an initial price of $23 per share, trading on NASDAQ under the symbol JDEC. By 1998, JD Edwards&#x27; revenue was more than $934 million and McVaney decided to retire.

===Quality control issues with OneWorld===
Within a year of the release of OneWorld, customers and industry analysts were discussing serious reliability, unpredictability and other bug-related issues. In user group meetings, these issues were raised with JDE management. So serious were these major quality issues with OneWorld that customers began to raise the possibility of class-action lawsuits, leading to McVaney&#x27;s return from retirement as CEO. At an internal meeting in 2000, McVaney said he had decided to &quot;wait however long it took to have OneWorld 100% reliable&quot; and had thus delayed the release of a new version of OneWorld because he &quot;wasn&#x27;t going to let it go out on the street until it was ready for prime time.&quot; McVaney also encouraged customer feedback by supporting an independent JD Edwards user group called Quest International. After delaying the upgrade for one year and refusing all requests by marketing for what he felt was a premature release, in the fall of 2000 JD Edwards released version B7333, now rebranded as OneWorld Xe.

Despite press skepticism, Xe proved to be the most stable release to date and went a long way toward restoring customer confidence. McVaney retired again in January 2002, although remaining a director, and Robert Dutkowsky from Teradyne was appointed as the new president and CEO.

===Web-based client, continued product evolution===
After the release of Xe, the product began to go through more broad change and several new versions. A new web-based client, in which the user accesses the JD Edwards software through their web browser, was introduced in 2001. This web-based client was robust enough for customer use and was given application version number 8.10 in 2005. Initial issues with release 8.11 in 2005 lead to a quick service pack to version 8.11 SP1, salvaging the reputation of that product. By 2006, version 8.12 was announced. Throughout the application releases, new releases of system/foundation code called Tools Releases were announced, moving from Tools Release versions 8.94 to 8.95. Tools Release 8.96, along with the application&#x27;s upgrade to version 8.12, saw the replacement of the older, often unstable proprietary object specifications (also called &quot;specs&quot;) with a new XML-based system, proving to be much more reliable. Tools Release 8.97 shipped a new web service layer allowing the JD Edwards software to communicate with third-party systems.

===Acquisition by PeopleSoft and Oracle===
In June 2003, the JD Edwards board agreed to an offer in which PeopleSoft, a former competitor of JD Edwards, would acquire JD Edwards. The takeover was completed in July. OneWorld was added to PeopleSoft&#x27;s software line, along with PeopleSoft&#x27;s flagship product Enterprise, and was renamed JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.

Within days of the PeopleSoft announcement, Oracle Corporation mounted a hostile takeover bid of PeopleSoft. Although the first attempts to purchase the company were rebuffed by the PeopleSoft board of directors, by December 2004 the board decided to accept Oracle&#x27;s offer. The final purchase went through in January 2005; Oracle now owned both PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. Most JD Edwards customers, employees, and industry analysts predicted Oracle would kill the JD Edwards products. However, Oracle saw a position for JDE in the medium-sized company space that was not filled with either its e-Business Suite or its newly acquired PeopleSoft Enterprise product.

=== EnterpriseOne and World software in Oracle portfolio ===
Oracle&#x27;s JD Edwards products are known as JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and JD Edwards World. Oracle announced that JD Edwards support would continue until at least 2033.

Support for the older releases such as the Xe product were to expire by 2013, spurring the acceptance of upgrades to newer application releases. By 2015, the latest offering of EnterpriseOne was application version 9.2, released October 2015. The latest version of World (now with a web-based interface) was version A9.4, released in April 2015.

Shortly after Oracle acquired PeopleSoft and JD Edwards in 2005, Oracle announced the development of a new product called Oracle Fusion Applications. Fusion was designed to co-exist or replace JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and World, as well as Oracle E-Business Applications Suite and other products acquired by Oracle, and was finally released in September 2010. Despite the release of Fusion apps, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and World is still sold and supported by Oracle and runs numerous businesses worldwide.

<text>Pretty Together is the sixth studio album by the Canadian rock group Sloan. While the album still has the 1960s and 1970s influences of Sloan&#x27;s previous albums, it is more melancholy with fewer of the upbeat songs found on previous albums. &quot;If It Feels Good Do It&quot; and &quot;The Other Man&quot; were the two singles released from the album, with the latter being a melancholy plea by Chris Murphy which marked a departure from the usual upbeat songs Murphy provides the group with. The album reached #12 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and both singles received notable radio airplay in Canada. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2002 Juno Awards.

<text>The Long Run is the sixth studio album by American rock group the Eagles. It was released in 1979 by Asylum Records in the United States and the United Kingdom. This was the first Eagles album to feature bassist Timothy B. Schmit, who had replaced founding member Randy Meisner, and the last full studio album to feature Don Felder before his termination from the band in 2001.

This was the band&#x27;s final studio album for Asylum Records. It also turned out to be their last studio album during their original tenure, as the Eagles disbanded in 1980; even though they reunited in 1994, they did not release another studio album until 2007&#x27;s &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;.

Three singles were released from the album, &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, &quot;The Long Run&quot;, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot;. &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot; reached No. 1 on the singles chart and won a Grammy Award. The album was certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA and has sold more than eight million copies in the US.

==Background==
The album was originally intended to be a double album. The band could not come up with enough songs and the idea was therefore scrapped. The recording was protracted; they started recording in 1978, and the album took 18 months to record in five different studios, with the album finally released in September 1979. According to Don Henley, the band members were &quot;completely burned out&quot; and &quot;physically, emotionally, spiritually and creatively exhausted&quot; from a long tour when they started recording the album, and they had few songs. However, they managed to put together ten songs for the album, with contribution from their friends JD Souther and Bob Seger who co-wrote with Frey and Henley on &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;. (Souther also got songwriting credit on &quot;Teenage Jail&quot; and &quot;The Sad Cafe&quot;.)

According to Henley, the title track was in part a response to press articles that said they were &quot;passé&quot; as disco was then dominant and punk emerging, which inspired lines such as &quot;Who is gonna make it/ We&#x27;ll find out in the long run&quot;. He said that the inspiration for the lyrics was also &quot;irony&quot;, as they wrote about longevity and posterity while the group &quot;was breaking apart, imploding under the pressure of trying to deliver a worthy follow-up to &quot;Hotel California&quot;&quot;.

Randy Meisner decided to leave the Eagles after an argument in Knoxville, Tennessee, during the Hotel California Tour in June 1977. He was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit, who brought an unfinished song to the band, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot;. Schmit wrote the song based loosely on his own experiences; both Henley and Frey liked the song and they completed the song together. Joe Walsh also contributed the song &quot;In the City&quot;, which was first recorded by Walsh for the movie soundtrack for &quot;The Warriors&quot;, where it was credited to Walsh, not the Eagles. Don Felder wrote the tune for &quot;The Disco Strangler&quot; using a four-on-the-floor disco beat as the basis for the composition. Henley wrote the lyrics. Henley intended the song to be an antidote to disco as both he and the rest of the band disliked disco, which was the most popular musical genre at the time. The song &quot;The Sad Cafe&quot; was inspired by the Troubadour nightclub in Hollywood where the Eagles once played, and also by Dan Tana&#x27;s restaurant that they frequented, while &quot;The Greeks Don&#x27;t Want No Freaks&quot; was written as a homage to Sixties &quot;frat rock&quot; such as the song &quot;96 Tears&quot; by ? and the Mysterians.

The album was produced by Bill Szymczyk, although the Eagles were listed as co-producers.

== Album pressing ==
The original vinyl record pressings of &quot;The Long Run&quot; (Elektra/Asylum catalog no. 5E-508) had text engraved in the run-out groove of each side, continuing an in-joke trend the band had started with their 1975 album &quot;One of These Nights&quot;:

# Side one: &quot;Never let your monster lay down&quot;
# Side two: &quot;From the Polack who sailed north&quot; (may be a reference to the producer of the album Bill Szymczyk)

==Critical reception==

In 1979 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;Overall, &quot;The Long Run&quot; is a synthesis of previous macabre Eagles motifs, with cynical new insights that are underlined by slashing rock &amp; roll...(it) is a bitter, wrathful, difficult record, full of piss and vinegar and poisoned expectations. Because it’s steeped in fresh, risky material and unflinching self-examination, it’s also the Eagles’ best work in many, many years.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; determined that &quot;the Eagles&#x27; fawning synthesis of various kinds of rock and that roll sits less well the smoother it gets.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;The Long Run&quot; &quot;is neatly balanced among standard Eagles rockers, rather shallow social commentary, ballads and novelty numbers,&quot; and noted that the band&#x27;s &quot;mean streak&quot; has &quot;never been so apparent.&quot;

Reviewing the album retrospectively in AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann wrote that the album was a &quot;major disappointment, even though it sold several million copies and threw off three hit singles,&quot; adding that the album &quot;reportedly was planned as a double album before being truncated to a single disc. If these were the keepers, what could the rejects have sounded like?&quot;

==Commercial performance==
When released in September 1979, &quot;The Long Run&quot; debuted at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop Albums chart and a week later hit number one. It stood for nine weeks in the number one slot. &quot;The Long Run&quot; was first certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 1, 1980, and reached 7× Platinum status on March 20, 2001. It has sold more than eight million copies in the US.

The album generated three Top 10 singles, &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, the album&#x27;s title cut, and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot;. Those singles reached No. 1, No. 8 and No. 8 respectively. The band also won a Grammy Award for &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;.

The album reached number 1 in Japan in 1979.

==Long Run Leftovers==
It appears that several more songs were submitted for &quot;The Long Run&quot;, but did not make it. Some of these are included in the collection &quot;Selected Works: 1972–1999&quot;, with the title “Long Run Leftovers”, though in a barely-recognizable form. Joe Walsh later resurrected two of them, which surfaced on his solo albums: “Rivers (of the Hidden Funk)” on &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; (1981) and “I Told You So” on &quot;You Bought It, You Name It&quot; (1983). The music of both of them appear to have been written by Don Felder, with lyrics by Walsh. Felder is also credited for playing guitar on both songs.

<doc id="252919" wikidata="Q1307909" url="?curid=252919" title="Ligne claire">
<text>Ligne claire (; ; both meaning &quot;clear line&quot;) is a style of drawing created and pioneered by Hergé, the Belgian cartoonist and creator of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. It uses clear strong lines sometimes of varied width and no hatching, while contrast is downplayed as well. Cast shadows are often illuminated, and the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background. The name was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977.

== History ==
Hergé started out drawing in a much looser, rougher style which was likely influenced by American comic strip artists of the late 1920s and 1930s, such as Gluyas Williams and George McManus. However the precise lines which characterize most of his work are firmly in place early on (e.g. the colored version of &quot;The Blue Lotus,&quot; released in 1946, is based on the original black and white newspaper version from 1934 to 1935 and not redrawn). Ligne claire was also influenced by Japan&#x27;s shin-hanga style, one aspect of the Japonisme movement that swept Europe after the opening up of Japan to European influence in the 1860s.

Much of the &quot;Brussels school&quot; started to use this style, notably Edgar P. Jacobs, Bob de Moor, Roger Leloup, and Jacques Martin, many of whom also worked for &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

The &quot;ligne claire&quot; style achieved its highest popularity in the 1950s, but its influence started to wane in the 1960s and was seen as old-fashioned by the new generation of comic book artists. In the late 1970s, it experienced a resurgence of interest, largely due to Dutch artists like Joost Swarte and Theo van den Boogaard, who had come up through the Dutch underground comics scene, as well as the French artist Jacques Tardi. Henk Kuijpers was also successful in his application of the style.

Throughout the 1980s, Yves Chaland, Ted Benoit, Serge Clerc and Floc&#x27;h relaunched the &quot;ligne claire&quot; style in France. This incarnation was a very stylistic and artistic variation, which the artists also utilized for illustrating posters and LP covers etc. Swarte dubbed this variant &quot;atoomstijl&quot; (&quot;atomic style&quot;).

Contemporary use of the &quot;ligne claire&quot; is often ironic or post-modern. For example, Van den Boogaard used the simple, clear style to set up a conflict with the amorality of his characters, while Tardi used it in his &quot;Adèle Blanc-Sec&quot; series to create a nostalgic atmosphere which is then ruthlessly undercut by the story. A recent serious clear line artist is the Dutchman Peter van Dongen, who created the &quot;Rampokan&quot; series about the Dutch colonisation of Indonesia.

&quot;Ligne claire&quot; is not confined to Franco-Belgian comics. It has also been popular with Italian artists such as Vittorio Giardino, Spanish artists such as Paco Roca and Francesc Capdevila Gisbert (&quot;Max&quot;), British artists such as Martin Handford, Bryan Talbot and Garen Ewing, Norwegian artists such as Jason, American artists such as Chris Ware, Geof Darrow, Jason Lutes, Charles Burns, Jason Little, and Italian-Australian artists such as Ilya Milstein.

In 2022, the first monograph entirely dedicated to the clear line, &quot;The Clear Line in Comics and Cinema: A Transmedial Approach&quot;, by Portuguese scholar David Pinho Barros, was published by Leuven University Press in the collection &quot;Studies in European Comics and Graphic Novels&quot;.

<text>Bombuzal is a puzzle video game designed by Antony Crowther (credited as &quot;Ratt&quot; in the game) and David Bishop for Image Works. The game was released in 1988 for the Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64. It was also released in 1989 for MS-DOS and in December 1990 in Japan for the Super Famicom, with the North American version released in August 1992 renamed as &quot;Ka-Blooey&quot;.

The game has a sequel/remake available for the Nintendo 64 called &quot;Charlie Blast&#x27;s Territory&quot;. Among its notable features is the ability to play using either an overhead or isometric view.

==Gameplay==

To complete each of its 130 levels, the avatar has to destroy all bombs on the level. It must stand on top of the bomb to light it, then is only able to take one step away before the bomb explodes; it can also pick up and move bombs, but only the ones that are on Rail tiles. Bombs come in different sizes and it is only possible to ignite the smallest kind without dying. In most cases, the bombs have to be set off using a chain reaction to prevent the avatar from being killed in the explosion; at other times, separated small bombs can be destroyed one at a time. Each bomb/mine has a reaction zone. For example, a small bomb will only destroy the tile it is on, but will affect any other bombs/mines one tile away in the four main directions. A large bomb will destroy 13 tiles, and its reaction zone will be one tile farther away than the tiles destroyed in each of the four directions, and diagonally between these four points. The game features level designs by several gaming celebrities, including Jon Ritman, Andrew Braybrook, Geoff Crammond and Jeff Minter.

There are also two enemies, Sinister and Dexter, appearing on some levels. These continuously travel along with the level, with Sinister always turning left and Dexter always turning right. Neither Sinister nor Dexter actively pursues the avatar, but contact with either is fatal.

==Reception==

The game received mixed reviews. It received 97% and 92% ratings from Zzap!64 magazine for the C64 and Amiga versions respectively, compared to a review in Commodore User magazine awarding a mere 49%. The former reviews hailed it as an addictive puzzle game with &quot;cute&quot; graphics, while the latter criticized gameplay, graphics, and controls.

The game was released by Spotlight Software and distributed by Cinemaware in the compilation &quot;BrainBlaster&quot; with &quot;Xenon 2&quot; for the Amiga. This compilation was reviewed in 1991 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #165 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave &quot;BrainBlaster&quot; 5 out of 5 stars.

The Amiga version of &quot;Bombuzal&quot; was included as a fully working game on the cover disk of the first issue of &quot;Amiga Power&quot;.

The Super Famicom incarnation of the game was later released for release on the Online service for the Nintendo Switch console in July 2021.

<doc id="252924" wikidata="Q1401612" url="?curid=252924" title="Lunfardo">
<text>Lunfardo (; from the Italian &quot;lombardo&quot; or inhabitant of Lombardy, &quot;lumbard&quot; in Lombard) is an argot originated and developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the lower classes in the Río de la Plata region (encompassing the port cities of Buenos Aires and Montevideo) and from there spread to other urban areas nearby, such as the Greater Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Rosario.

Lunfardo originated from the mixture of languages and dialects produced due to the massive European immigration, mainly Italian and Spanish, which arrived in the ports of the region since the end of the 19th century. It was originally a slang used by criminals and soon by other people of the lower and lower-middle classes. Later, many of its words and phrases were introduced in the vernacular and disseminated in the Spanish of Argentina, and Uruguay. Nevertheless, since the early 20th century, Lunfardo has spread among all social strata and classes by habitual use or because it was common in the lyrics of tango.

Today, the meaning of the term &quot;lunfardo&quot; has been extended to designate any slang or jargon used in Buenos Aires.

==Origin==
Lunfardo (or &quot;lunfa&quot; for short) began as prison slang in the late 19th century so guards would not understand prisoners. According to Oscar Conde, the word came from &quot;lumbardo&quot; (the inhabitants of the region Lombardia in Italy, the origin of most of the Italians in Argentina in the early 20th century). However, the vernacular Spanish of mid-19th century Buenos Aires as preserved in the dialogue of Esteban Echeverría&#x27;s short story The Slaughter Yard (&quot;El matadero&quot;) is already a prototype of Lunfardo.

==Etymology==
Most sources believe that Lunfardo originated among criminals, and later became more commonly used by other classes. Circa 1870, the word &quot;lunfardo&quot; itself (originally a deformation of &quot;lombardo&quot; in several Italian dialects) was often used to mean &quot;outlaw&quot;.

==Lunfardo today==
Today, many Lunfardo terms have entered the language spoken all over Argentina and Uruguay, although a great number of Lunfardo words have fallen into disuse or have been modified in the era of suburbanization. Furthermore, the term &quot;Lunfardo&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;speech of Buenos Aires&quot; or &quot;Porteño&quot;, mainly of the inhabitants of the City of Buenos Aires, as well as its surrounding areas, Greater Buenos Aires. The Montevideo speech has almost as much &quot;Lunfardo slang&quot; as the Buenos Aires speech. Conde says that Lunfardo (much like Cocoliche) can be considered a kind of Italian dialect mixed with Spanish words, specifically the one spoken in Montevideo. In other words, Lunfardo is an &quot;interlanguage variety&quot; of the Italian dialects spoken by immigrants in the areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo.

In Argentina, any neologism that reached a minimum level of acceptance is considered, by default, a Lunfardo term. The original slang has been immortalized in numerous tango lyrics.

Conde takes the view that the Lunfardo is not so much a dialect but a kind of local language of the Italian immigrants, mixed with Spanish and some French words. He believes that Lunfardo is not a criminal slang, since most Lunfardo words are not related to crime.

According to Conde, Lunfardo

==Characteristics==
Lunfardo words are inserted in the normal flow of Rioplatense Spanish sentences, but grammar and pronunciation do not change. Thus, an average Spanish-speaking person reading tango lyrics will need, at most, the translation of a discrete set of words.

Tango lyrics use Lunfardo sparsely, but some songs (such as &quot;El Ciruja&quot;—Lunfardo for &quot;The Hobo&quot; or &quot;The Bum&quot;—or most lyrics by Celedonio Flores) employ Lunfardo heavily. &quot;Milonga Lunfarda&quot; by Edmundo Rivero is an instructive and entertaining primer on Lunfardo usage.

A characteristic of Lunfardo is its use of word play, notably &quot;vesre&quot; (from &quot;[al] revés&quot;), reversing the syllables, similar to English back slang, French verlan, Serbo-Croatian Šatrovački or Greek Podaná. Thus, &quot;tango&quot; becomes &quot;gotán&quot; and &quot;café&quot; (coffee) becomes &quot;feca&quot;.

Lunfardo employs metaphors such as &quot;bobo&quot; (&quot;dumb&quot;) for the heart, who &quot;works all day long without being paid&quot; or &quot;bufoso&quot; (&quot;snorter&quot;) for pistol.

Finally, there are words that are derived from others in Spanish, such as the verb &quot;abarajar&quot;, which means to stop a situation or a person (such as &quot;to stop your opponent&#x27;s blows with the blade of your knife&quot;) and is related to the verb &quot;barajar&quot;, which means to cut or shuffle a deck of cards.

* &quot;¡guarda!&quot; - &quot;look out!&quot;, &quot;be careful!&quot; (from the Italian &quot;guarda!&quot;, &quot;look!&quot;)

==Modern slang==
Since the 1970s, it is a matter of debate whether newer additions to the slang of Buenos Aires qualify as lunfardo. Traditionalists argue that lunfardo &quot;must&quot; have a link to the argot of the old underworld, to tango lyrics, or to racetrack slang. Others maintain that the colloquial language of Buenos Aires is lunfardo by definition.

Some examples of modern talk:

* &quot;gomas&quot; (lit. &quot;tires&quot;) – &quot;tits&quot;, woman&#x27;s breasts
* &quot;maza&quot; (lit. &quot;mace&quot; or &quot;sledgehammer&quot;) – &quot;superb&quot;
* &quot;curtir&quot; (lit. &quot;to tan leather&quot;) – &quot;to deal with it&quot;, &quot;to dig&quot;, &quot;to be knowledgeable about&quot;, &quot;to be involved in&quot;. Also &quot;to fuck&quot;.
*&quot;curtir fierros&quot; can mean both &quot;to be into car mechanics&quot; or &quot;to be into firearms&quot;. &quot;Fierro&quot; is the Old Spanish form of &quot;hierro&quot; (&quot;iron&quot;). In Argentine parlance, &quot;fierro&quot; can mean a firearm or anything related to metals and mechanics (for example a racing car)
* &quot;zafar&quot; – &quot;to scrape out of&quot;, &quot;to get off the hook&quot;, &quot;to barely get by&quot;, etc. &quot;Zafar&quot; is a standard Spanish verb (originally meaning &quot;to extricate oneself&quot;) that had fallen out of use and was restored to everyday Buenos Aires speech in the 1970s by students, with the meaning of &quot;barely passing (an examination)&quot;.
* &quot;trucho&quot; – &quot;counterfeit&quot;, &quot;fake&quot;; &quot;trucho&quot; is from old Spanish slang &quot;truchamán&quot;, which in turn derives from the Arabic &quot;turjeman&quot; (&quot;translator&quot;, referring specifically to a person who accosts foreigners and lures them into tourist traps). Folk etymology derives this word from &quot;trucha&quot; (&quot;trout&quot;), or from the Italian &quot; -&quot; something made fake on purpose. 

Many new terms had spread from specific areas of the dynamic Buenos Aires cultural scene: invented by screenwriters, used around the arts-and-crafts fair in Plaza Francia, culled from the vocabulary of psychoanalysis.

==Influence from Cocoliche==
Lunfardo was influenced by Cocoliche, a pidgin of Italian immigrants. Many Cocoliche words were transferred to Lunfardo in the first half of the 20th century. For example:

* &quot;lonyipietro&quot; - &quot;fool&quot;
* &quot;fungi&quot; - &quot;mushroom&quot; → in Lunfardo: &quot;hat&quot;
* &quot;vento&quot; - &quot;wind&quot; → in Lunfardo: &quot;money&quot;
* &quot;matina&quot; - &quot;morning&quot; (from Italian &quot;mattina&quot;)
* &quot;mina&quot; - &quot;girl&quot; (from Lombard &quot;mina&quot;)
* &quot;laburar&quot; - &quot;to work&quot; (from Italian &quot;lavorare&quot; and Spanish &quot;laborar&quot;)
* &quot;minga&quot; - &quot;nothing!&quot; (from Lombard &quot;minga,&quot; negative particle like &quot;not&quot; in English or &quot;ne pas&quot; in French)
* &quot;yeta&quot; - &quot;bad luck&quot; (from Neapolitan )
* &quot;yira/yira&quot; - &quot;to walk around (generally in circles)&quot;, &quot;to ramble aimlessly&quot;, etc. (from Italian &quot;girare&quot;, &quot;to turn&quot;, &quot;to tour&quot;). Usually &quot;yiro&quot; or &quot;yira&quot; is used to refer to a prostitute.
* &quot;¡salute!&quot; - &quot;cheers!&quot; (from Italian &quot;salute!&quot;)
* &quot;eccole&quot; - &quot;exactly&quot; (from Italian &quot;eccole&quot;)

Some Italian linguists, because of the Cocoliche influences, argue that the Lunfardo can be considered a &quot;pidgin&quot; of the Italian language.

==Suffixes==
A rarer feature of Porteño speech that can make it completely unintelligible is the random addition of suffixes with no particular meaning, usually making common words sound reminiscent of Italian surnames, for no particular reason, but playful language. These endings include -&quot;etti&quot;, -&quot;elli&quot; &quot;eli&quot;, -&quot;oni&quot;, -&quot;eni&quot;, -&quot;anga&quot;, -&quot;ango&quot;, -&quot;enga&quot;, -&quot;engue&quot;, -&quot;engo&quot;, -&quot;ingui&quot;, -&quot;ongo&quot;, -&quot;usi&quot;, -&quot;ula&quot;, -&quot;usa&quot;, -&quot;eta&quot;, among others. Examples: &quot;milanesa&quot; (meat dish) formula_1 &quot;milanga, cuaderno&quot; (&quot;notebook&quot;) formula_1 &quot;cuadernelli&quot;, etc.

<doc id="252926" wikidata="Q1816539" url="?curid=252926" title="Rogallo wing">
<text>The Rogallo wing is a flexible type of wing. In 1948, Francis Rogallo, a NASA engineer, and his wife Gertrude Rogallo, invented a self-inflating flexible wing they called the Parawing, also known after them as the &quot;Rogallo Wing&quot; and flexible wing. NASA considered Rogallo&#x27;s flexible wing as an alternative recovery system for the Mercury and Gemini space capsules, and for possible use in other spacecraft landings, but the idea was dropped from Gemini in 1964 in favor of conventional parachutes.

==History==
Rogallo had been interested in the flexible wing since 1945. He and his wife built and flew kites as a hobby. They could not find official backing for the wing, including at Rogallo&#x27;s employer National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), so they carried out experiments in their own time. By the end of 1948 they had two working designs using a flexible wing — a kite they called &quot;Flexi-Kite&quot; and a gliding parachute they later referred to as a &quot;paraglider&quot;. Rogallo and his wife received a patent on a flexible square wing in March 1951. Selling the Flexi-kite as a toy helped to finance their work and publicize the design.

==NASA research==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, U.S. aerospace manufacturers worked on parachute designs for space capsule recovery. NASA briefly considered the Rogallo wing to replace the traditional round parachute for the Project Mercury capsule during temporary development problems. Later, the Rogallo wing was the initial choice for the Project Gemini capsule, but development problems ultimately forced its replacement with the parachute.

==Construction==
Nowadays the term &quot;Rogallo wing&quot; is synonymous with one composed of two partial conic surfaces with both cones pointing forward. Slow Rogallo wings have wide, shallow cones. Fast subsonic and supersonic Rogallo wings have long, narrow cones. The Rogallo wing is a simple and inexpensive flying wing with remarkable properties. The wing itself is not a kite, nor can it be characterized as glider or powered aircraft, until the wing is tethered or arranged in a configuration that glides or is powered. In other words, how it is attached and manipulated determines what type of aircraft it becomes. The Rogallo wing is most often seen in toy kites, but has been used to construct spacecraft parachutes, sport parachutes, ultralight powered aircraft like the trike and hang gliders. Rogallo had more than one patent concerning his finding; the due-diligence expansion of his invention involved cylindrical formats, multiple lobes, various stiffenings, various nose angles, etc. The Charles Richards design and use of the Rogallo wing in the NASA Paresev project resulted in an assemblage that became the stark template for the standard Rogallo hang-glider wing that would blanket the world of the sport in the early 1970s.

Beyond that, the wing is designed to bend and flex in the wind, and so provides favorable dynamics analogous to a spring suspension. Flexibility allows the wing to be less susceptible to turbulence and provides a gentler flying experience than a similarly sized rigid-winged aircraft. The trailing edge of the wing – which is not stiffened – allows the wing to twist, and provides aerodynamic stability without the need for a tail (empennage).

==Rogallo wing hang glider==
In 1961–1962, aeronautical engineer Barry Palmer foot-launched several versions of a framed Rogallo wing hang glider to continue the recreational and sporting spirit of hang gliding. Another player in the continuing evolution of the Rogallo wing hang glider was James Hobson whose &quot;Rogallo Hang Glider&quot; was published in 1962 in the Experimental Aircraft Association&#x27;s magazine Sport Aviation, as well as shown on national USA television in the &quot;Lawrence Welk Show&quot;. Later in Australia John Dickenson in mid-1963, set out to build a controllable waterskiing kite/glider, which he admitted adapting from a Ryan Aeronautical flex-wing aircraft. Publicity from the Paresev tested-and-flown hang gliders and the various space contractors sparked interest in the Rogallo-promoted wing design among several amateur designersin: Thomas H. Purcell Jr., Barry Hill Palmer, James Hobson, Mike Burns, John Dickenson, Richard Miller, Bill Moyes, Bill Bennett, Dave Kilbourne, Dick Eipper and many others. A renaissance in hang gliding occurred in the 1960s, and John Worth was the early leader in the pack of four-boom hang glider builders and designers using public domain designs.

Single-point hang was fully demonstrated in Breslau in 1908, as well as the triangle control frame that would later be seen in NASA&#x27;s and John Worth&#x27;s hang gliders and powered hang gliders. Thomas Purcell and Mike Burns would use the triangle control frame. Much later Dickenson would do similarly as he fashioned an airframe to fit on the by-then standard four boom stiffened Rogallo wing. Dickenson&#x27;s model made use of a single hang point and an A frame: He started with a framed Rogallo wing airfoil with a U-frame (later an A-frame control bar) to it; it was composed of a keel, leading edges, a cross-bar and a fixed control frame. Weight-shift was also used to control the glider. The flexible wing – called &quot;Ski Wing&quot; – was first flown in public at the Grafton Jacaranda Festival in September 1963 by Rod Fuller while towed behind a motorboat.

The Australian Self-Soar Association states that the first foot-launch of a hang glider in Australia was in 1972. In Torrance, California, Bill Moyes was assisted in a kited foot-launch by Joe Faust at a beach slope in 1971 or 1972. Moyes went on to build a company with his own trade-named Rogallo wing hang gliders that used the trapeze control frame he had seen in Dickenson&#x27;s and Australian manned flat-kite ski kites. Bill Moyes and Bill Bennett exported new refinements of their own hang gliders throughout the world. The parawing hang glider was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1995.

Hang gliders have been used with different forms of weight-shift control since Otto Lilienthal. The most common way to shift the center of gravity was to fly while suspended from the underarms by two parallel bars. Gottlob Espenlaub (1922), George Spratt (1929) and Barry Palmer (1962) used pendulum seats for the pilot. Interaction with the frame provided various means of control of the Rogallo winged hang glider.

Today, most Rogallo wings are also controlled by changing their pitch and roll by means of shifting its center of gravity. This is done by suspending the payload from one or more points beneath the wing and then moving the pendulumed mass of the payload (pilot and things else) left or right or forward or aft. Several control methods were studied by NASA for Rogallo wings from 1958 through the 1960s embodied in different versions of the Parawing.

On Rogallo wing hang gliders, John Dickenson used a type of weight-shift control frame composed of a mounted triangular control frame under the wing. The pilot sat on a seat and was sometimes also harnessed about the torso. The pilot was suspended behind the triangular control frame which was used as a hand support to push and pull in order to shift the pilot&#x27;s weight relative to the mass and attitude of the wing above.

==Rogallo skydiving canopies==
After NASA discontinued its Paresev research in 1965, the concept of gliding parachutes was pursued for military and other more Earth-bound purposes. These avenues eventually introduced versions of the inflating flexible Rogallo wing to the sport of skydiving. Irvin advertised a Hawk and Eagle model in 1967, but these were only available for a very limited time before they introduced the &quot;Irvin Delta II Parawing&quot; in 1968. This was the most produced and developed of the early Rogallo wing skydiving canopies. They were manufactured by three of Irvin&#x27;s factories – in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.
The &quot;Delta II&quot; had colored suspension lines to help guide the packing process, and also had a unique &quot;Opening Shock Inhibitor&quot; OSI strap that helped retard the high opening speeds and shocks. The packing volume of the canopy was slightly bigger than the then state-of-the-art Para-Commander. As one of the first types of gliding canopy, it received a considerable level of interest from jumpers. However, it developed a reputation for being unreliable, as it seemed prone to malfunctions on opening, possibly due to the unorthodox packing techniques for such a new design of canopy. However, when deployed successfully, the glide and performance was markedly better than a Para-Commander type canopy.

The &quot;Delta II&quot; was available until 1975 and paved the way for other Rogallo Wing skydiving canopies, such as the Handbury &quot;Para-Dactyl&quot;. This was made in both single-keel and dual-keel versions as a main parachute in the mid to late 1970s, and also as a reserve parachute version known as a Safety-Dactyl. This was a US-made canopy and featured a sail-slider to reduce opening speeds and opening forces as is normal on a modern ram air canopy. A Russian Rogallo-Wing canopy known as a PZ-81 was available as late as 1995. The Rogallo wing canopy was superseded in the late 1970s by the ram-air canopies which had improved their reliability and performance, and reduced their packed volume, compared to all other gliding and non-gliding parachutes.

==Rogallo kites==
Rogallo wing kites control pitch with a bridle that sets the wing&#x27;s angle of attack. A bridle made of string is usually a loop reaching from the front to the end of the center strut of the A-frame. The user ties knots (usually a girth hitch) in the bridle to set the angle of attack. Mass-produced rogallo kites use a bridle that&#x27;s a triangle of plastic film, with one edge heat-sealed to the central strut.

Steerable Rogallo kites usually have a pair of bridles setting a fixed pitch, and use two strings, one on each side of the kite, to change the roll.

Rogallo also developed a series of soft foil designs in the 1960s which have been modified for traction kiting. These are double keel designs with conic wings and a multiple attachment bridle which can be used with either dual line or quad line controls. They have excellent pull, but suffer from a smaller window than more modern traction designs. Normally the #5 and #9 alternatives are used.

==Early Rogallo patents==
Despite similar designs having appeared earlier and critical innovations such as the triangular control frame and harness for adequate weight-shift control having been developed by others, Rogallo holds several patents.
