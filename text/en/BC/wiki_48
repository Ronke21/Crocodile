<text>The modern combine harvester, also called a combine, is a machine designed to harvest a variety of cultivated seeds. Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important labour-saving inventions, significantly reducing the fraction of the population engaged in agriculture. Among the crops harvested with a combine are wheat, rice, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), sorghum, millet, soybeans, flax (linseed), sunflowers and rapeseed (canola). The separated straw (consisting of stems and any remaining leaves with limited nutrients left in it) is then either chopped onto the field and ploughed back in, or laid out in rows, ready to be baled and used for bedding and cattle feed.

The name of the machine is derived from the fact that the harvester combined multiple separate harvesting operations – reaping, threshing or winnowing and gathering – into a single process around the start of the 20th century. A combine harvester still performs those operation principles. The machine can easily be divided into four parts, namely: the intake mechanism, the threshing and separation system, the cleaning system, and finally the grain handling and storage system. Electronic monitoring assists the operator by providing an overview of the machine&#x27;s operation, and the field&#x27;s yield.

==History ==
In 1826 in Scotland, the inventor Reverend Patrick Bell designed a reaper machine, which used the scissors principle of plant cutting (a principle that is used to this day). The Bell machine was pushed by horses. A few Bell machines were available in the United States. In 1835, in the United States, Hiram Moore built and patented the first combine harvester, which was capable of reaping, threshing and winnowing cereal grain. Early versions were pulled by horse, mule or ox teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version with a length of 5.2 m (17 ft) and a cut width of 4.57 m (15 ft); by 1839, over of crops were harvested. This combine harvester was pulled by 20 horses fully handled by farmhands. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting, or swathe, width of several metres were used on American farms.

A parallel development in Australia saw the development of the stripper based on the Gallic stripper, by John Ridley and others in South Australia by 1843. The stripper only gathered the heads, leaving the stems in the field. The stripper and later headers had the advantage of fewer moving parts and only collecting heads, requiring less power to operate. Refinements by Hugh Victor McKay produced a commercially successful combine harvester in 1885, the Sunshine Header-Harvester.
Combines, some of them quite large, were drawn by mule or horse teams and used a bullwheel to provide power. Later, steam power was used, and George Stockton Berry integrated the combine with a steam engine using straw to heat the boiler. At the turn of the twentieth century, horse-drawn combines were starting to be used on the American plains and Idaho (often pulled by teams of twenty or more horses).

In 1911, the Holt Manufacturing Company of California, US produced a self-propelled harvester. In Australia in 1923, the patented Sunshine Auto Header was one of the first center-feeding self-propelled harvesters. In 1923 in Kansas, the Baldwin brothers and their Gleaner Manufacturing Company patented a self-propelled harvester that included several other modern improvements in grain handling. Both the Gleaner and the Sunshine used Fordson engines; early Gleaners used the entire Fordson chassis and driveline as a platform. In 1929, Alfredo Rotania of Argentina patented a self-propelled harvester.
International Harvester started making horse-pulled combines in 1915. At the time, horse-powered binders and stand-alone threshing machines were more common. In the 1920s, Case Corporation and John Deere made combines, introducing tractor-pulled harvesters with a second engine aboard the combine to power its workings. The world economic collapse in the 1930s stopped farm equipment purchases, and for this reason, people largely retained the older method of harvesting. A few farms did invest and used Caterpillar tractors to move the outfits.

Tractor-drawn combines (also called pull-type combines) became common after World War II as many farms began to use tractors. An example was the All-Crop Harvester series. These combines used a shaker to separate the grain from the chaff and straw-walkers (grates with small teeth on an eccentric shaft) to eject the straw while retaining the grain. Early tractor-drawn combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered, via a shaft transferring tractor engine power to operate the combine. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred via a chute.

In the U.S., Allis-Chalmers, Massey-Harris, International Harvester, Gleaner Manufacturing Company, John Deere, and Minneapolis Moline are past or present major combine producers.
In 1937, the Australian-born Thomas Carroll, working for Massey-Harris in Canada, perfected a self-propelled model and in 1940, a lighter-weight model began to be marketed widely by the company. Lyle Yost invented an auger that would lift grain out of a combine in 1947, making unloading grain much easier and further from the combine. In 1952 Claeys launched the first self-propelled combine harvester in Europe; in 1953, the European manufacturer Claas developed a self-propelled combine harvester named &#x27;Hercules&#x27;, it could harvest up to 5 tons of wheat a day. This newer kind of combine is still in use and is powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Until the self-cleaning rotary screen was invented in the mid-1960s combine engines suffered from overheating as the chaff spewed out when harvesting small grains would clog radiators, blocking the airflow needed for cooling.

A significant advance in the design of combines was the rotary design. The grain is initially stripped from the stalk by passing along a helical rotor, instead of passing between rasp bars on the outside of a cylinder and a concave. Rotary combines were first introduced by Sperry-New Holland in 1975.

Around the 1980s, on-board electronics were introduced to measure threshing efficiency. This new instrumentation allowed operators to get better grain yields by optimizing ground speed and other operating parameters.

The largest &quot;class 10-plus&quot; combines, which emerged in the early 2020&#x27;s, have nearly 800 engine horsepower (600 kW) and are fitted with headers up to wide.

==Combine header==

Combines are equipped with removable headers that are designed for particular crops. The standard header, sometimes called a grain platform, is equipped with a &quot;reciprocating knife cutter bar&quot;, and features a revolving reel with metal teeth to cause the cut crop to fall into the auger once it is cut. A variation of the platform, a &quot;flex&quot; platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.

Some wheat headers, called &quot;draper&quot; headers, use a fabric or rubber apron instead of a cross auger. Draper headers allow faster feeding than cross augers, leading to higher throughputs due to lower power requirements. On many farms, platform headers are used to cut wheat, instead of separate wheat headers, so as to reduce overall costs.

Dummy heads or pick-up headers feature spring-tined pickups, usually attached to a heavy rubber belt. They are used for crops that have already been cut and placed in windrows or swaths. This is particularly useful in northern climates such as western Canada, where swathing kills weeds resulting in a faster dry down.

While a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.

Occasionally rowcrop heads are seen that function like a grain platform but have points between rows like a corn head. These are used to reduce the amount of weed seed picked up when harvesting small grains.

Self-propelled Gleaner combines could be fitted with special tracks instead of tires to assist in harvesting rice. These tracks can be made to fit other combines by adding adapter plates. Some combines, particularly the pull type, have tires with a deep diamond tread which prevents sinking in mud.

==Conventional combine==

The cut crop is carried up the feeder throat (commonly called the &quot;feederhouse&quot;), by a &quot;chain and flight elevator&quot;, then fed into the threshing mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating &quot;threshing drum&quot; (commonly called the &quot;cylinder&quot;), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through the action of the cylinder against the &quot;concave&quot;, a shaped &quot;half drum&quot;, also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the &quot;straw walkers&quot;. This action is also allowed because grain is heavier than straw, which causes it to fall rather than &quot;float&quot; across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged &quot;disawning plates&quot; are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops. After the primary separation at the cylinder, the clean grain falls through the concave and to the shoe, which contains the chaffer and sieves. The shoe is common to both conventional combines and rotary combines.

==Hillside leveling==

Hillside leveling, in which a hydraulic system re-orients the combine, allows combines to harvest steep but fertile soil. Their primary advantage is increased threshing efficiency. Without leveling, grain and chaff slide to one side of the separator and come through the machine in a large ball rather than being separated, dumping large amounts of grain on the ground. By keeping the machinery level, the straw-walker is able to thresh more efficiently. Secondarily, leveling changes a combine&#x27;s center of gravity relative to the hill and allows the combine to harvest along the contour of a hill without tipping, a danger on steeper slopes; it is not uncommon for combines to roll over on extremely steep hills. Hillside leveling can be very important in regions with steep hills, such as the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where hillsides can have slopes as steep as 50%.

The first leveling technology was developed by Holt Co., a US company in California, in 1891. Modern leveling came into being with the invention and patent of a level sensitive mercury switch system invented by Raymond Alvah Hanson in 1946. A leveling system was also developed in Europe by the Italian combine manufacturer Laverda. Gleaner, IH/Case IH, John Deere, and others all have made combines with a hillside leveling system, and local machine shops have fabricated them as an aftermarket add-on. Newer leveling systems do not have as much tilt as the older ones, as modern combines use a rotary grain separator which makes leveling less critical. 

===Sidehill leveling===

Sidehill combines are very similar to hillside combines in that they level the combine to the ground so that the threshing can be efficiently conducted; however, they have some very distinct differences. Modern hillside combines level around 35% on average, while older machines were closer to 50%. Sidehill combines only level to 18%. They are sparsely used in the Palouse region. Rather, they are used on the gentle rolling slopes of the midwest. Sidehill combines are much more mass-produced than their hillside counterparts. The height of a sidehill machine is the same height as a level-land combine. Hillside combines have added steel that sets them up approximately 2–5 feet higher than a level-land combine and provide a smooth ride.

==Maintaining threshing speed==

Another technology that is sometimes used on combines is a continuously variable transmission. This allows the ground speed of the machine to be varied while maintaining a constant engine and threshing speed. It is desirable to keep the threshing speed constant since the machine will typically have been adjusted to operate best at a certain speed.

Self-propelled combines started with standard manual transmissions that provided one speed based on input rpm. Deficiencies were noted and in the early 1950s combines were equipped with what John Deere called the &quot;Variable Speed Drive&quot;. This was simply a variable width sheave controlled by spring and hydraulic pressures. This sheave was attached to the input shaft of the transmission. A standard 4-speed manual transmission was still used in this drive system. The operator would select a gear, typically 3rd. An extra control was provided to the operator to allow him to speed up and slow down the machine within the limits provided by the variable speed drive system. By decreasing the width of the sheave on the input shaft of the transmission, the belt would ride higher in the groove. This slowed the rotating speed on the input shaft of the transmission, thus slowing the ground speed for that gear. A clutch was still provided to allow the operator to stop the machine and change transmission gears.

Later, as hydraulic technology improved, hydrostatic transmissions were introduced for use on swathers but later this technology was applied to combines as well. This drive retained the 4-speed manual transmission as before, but used a system of hydraulic pumps and motors to drive the input shaft of the transmission. The engine turns the hydraulic pump capable of pressures up to . This pressure is then directed to the hydraulic motor that is connected to the input shaft of the transmission. The operator is provided with a lever in the cab that allows for the control of the hydraulic motor&#x27;s ability to use the energy provided by the pump.

Most if not all modern combines are equipped with hydrostatic drives. These are larger versions of the same system used in consumer and commercial lawn mowers that most are familiar with today. In fact, it was the downsizing of the combine drive system that placed these drive systems into mowers and other machines.

==The operating principle==



Despite great advances in mechanics and computer control, the basic operation of the combine harvester has remained unchanged almost since it was invented.

Power requirements over the years have increased due to larger capacities and some processes such as rotary threshing and straw chopping take considerable power. This is sometimes supplied by a large tractor in a pull-type combine, or a large gasoline or diesel engine in a self-propelled type. A frequent problem is the presence of airborne chaff and straw, which can accumulate causing a fire hazard and to radiators which can become plugged. Most machines have addressed these problems with enclosed engine compartments and rotary centrifugal inlet screens which prevent chaff buildup.

First, the header, described above, cuts the crop and feeds it into the threshing cylinder. This consists of a series of horizontal &quot;rasp bars&quot; fixed across the path of the crop and in the shape of a quarter cylinder. Moving rasp bars or rub bars pull the crop through concaved grates that separate the grain and chaff from the straw. The grain heads fall through the fixed concaves. What happens next is dependent on the type of combine in question. In most modern combines, the grain is transported to the shoe by a set of 2, 3, or 4 (possibly more on the largest machines) augers, set parallel or semi-parallel to the rotor on axial mounted rotors and perpendicular on axial-flow combines.

In older Gleaner machines, these augers were not present. Those combines are unique in that the cylinder and concave is set inside feederhouse instead of in the machine directly behind the feederhouse. Consequently, the material was moved by a &quot;raddle chain&quot; from underneath the concave to the walkers. The clean grain fell between the raddle and the walkers onto the shoe, while the straw, being longer and lighter, floated across onto the walkers to be expelled. On most other older machines, the cylinder was placed higher and farther back in the machine, and the grain moved to the shoe by falling down a &quot;clean grain pan&quot;, and the straw &quot;floated&quot; across the concaves to the back of the walkers.

Since the Sperry-New Holland TR70 twin-rotor combine came out in 1975, most manufacturers have combines with rotors in place of conventional cylinders. However, makers have now returned to the market with conventional models alongside their rotary line-up. A rotor is a long, longitudinally mounted rotating cylinder with plates similar to rub bars (except for in the above-mentioned Gleaner rotaries).

There are usually two sieves, one above the other. The sieves are basically metal frames that have many rows of &quot;fingers&quot; set reasonably close together. The angle of the fingers is adjustable, to change the clearance and thereby control the size of material passing through. The top is set with more clearance than the bottom to allow a gradual cleaning action. Setting the concave clearance, fan speed, and sieve size is critical to ensure that the crop is threshed properly, the grain is clean of debris, and all of the grain entering the machine reaches the grain tank or &#x27;hopper&#x27;. (Observe, for example, that when travelling uphill the fan speed must be reduced to account for the shallower gradient of the sieves.)

Heavy material, e.g., unthreshed heads, fall off the front of the sieves and are returned to the concave for re-threshing.

The straw walkers are located above the sieves, and also have holes in them. Any grain remaining attached to the straw is shaken off and falls onto the top sieve.

When the straw reaches the end of the walkers it falls out the rear of the combine. It can then be baled for cattle bedding or spread by two rotating straw spreaders with rubber arms. Most modern combines are equipped with a straw spreader.

Rather than immediately falling out the rear of the combine at the end of the walkers, there are models of combine harvesters from Eastern Europe and Russia (e.g. Agromash Yenisei 1200 1 HM, etc.) that have &quot;straw catchers&quot; at the end of the walkers, which temporarily hold the straw and then, once full, deposit it in a stack for easy gathering.

== Thresher designs ==
For some time, combine harvesters used the conventional design, which used a rotating cylinder at the front-end which knocked the seeds out of the heads, and then used the rest of the machine to separate the straw from the chaff, and the chaff from the grain. The TR70 from Sperry-New Holland was brought out in 1975 as the first rotary combine. Other manufacturers soon followed, International Harvester with their &quot;Axial-Flow&quot; in 1977 and Gleaner with their N6 in 1979.

In the decades before the widespread adoption of the rotary combine in the late seventies, several inventors had pioneered designs which relied more on centrifugal force for grain separation and less on gravity alone. By the early eighties, most major manufacturers had settled on a &quot;walkerless&quot; design with much larger threshing cylinders to do most of the work. Advantages were faster grain harvesting and gentler treatment of fragile seeds, which were often cracked by the faster rotational speeds of conventional combine threshing cylinders.

It was the disadvantages of the rotary combine (increased power requirements and over-pulverization of the straw by-product) which prompted a resurgence of conventional combines in the late nineties. Perhaps overlooked but nonetheless true, when the large engines that powered the rotary machines were employed in conventional machines, the two types of machines delivered similar production capacities. Also, research was beginning to show that incorporating above-ground crop residue (straw) into the soil is less useful for rebuilding soil fertility than previously believed. This meant that working pulverized straw into the soil became more of a hindrance than a benefit. An increase in feedlot beef production also created a higher demand for straw as fodder. Conventional combines, which use straw walkers, preserve the quality of straw and allow it to be baled and removed from the field.

==Instrumentation==

While the principles of basic threshing have changed little over the years, modern advancements in electronics and monitoring technology has continued to develop. Whereas older machines required the operator to rely on machine knowledge, frequent inspection and monitoring, and a keen ear to listen for subtle sound changes, newer machines have replaced many of those duties with instrumentation.

===Shaft monitors===
Early on, simple magnetic pickups were used to monitor shaft rotation, and issue a warning when they deviated beyond preset limits. Temperature sensors can also give warning when bearings overheat due to lack of lubrication, sometimes leading to combine fires.

===Loss monitors===
The job of monitoring how much grain is wasted by the thresher by being discharged with the chaff and straw used to require going behind the machine to check. Yield monitors work like a microphone, registering an electrical impulse caused by grains impacting a plate. A meter in the operator&#x27;s cab displays the relative amount of grain loss proportional to speed.

===Yield monitoring===
Measuring the amount of yield (bushels per acre or tonnes per hectare) has become increasingly important, particularly when real-time measurement can help determine which areas of a field are more or less productive. These variations can often be remediated with variable crop inputs. Yield is determined by measuring the amount of grain harvested in relation to the area covered.

===Cameras===

Cameras placed at strategic points on the machine can eliminate some of the guesswork for the operator.

===Field mapping===
The advent of GPS and GIS technologies has made it possible to create field maps, which can assist in navigation, and in the preparation of yield maps, which show which parts of the field are more productive.

== Combine size classification ==

While all combines aim to achieve the same result, each machine can be classified based on its general throughput based on the rated horsepower of the combine. Current combine classifications, as defined by Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), are as follows (metric horsepower, which is approximately 735.5 watts, is used):

* Class 5 - less than 280 HP
* Class 6 - 280 HP - 360 HP
* Class 7 - 360 HP - 500 HP
* Class 8 - 500 HP - 600 HP
* Class 9 - 600 HP - 680 HP
* Class 10 - more than 680 HP

While this classification is current, the classes themselves have evolved over time. For instance, a class 7 combine in the year 1980 would have had 270 horsepower and been one of the largest machines available in the world at that time, but in the 21st century the same machine would be considered small. The Association of Equipment Manufacturers recognizes Class 10, which came into being in 2013, as the largest combine class. However, there are combines with horsepower and threshing capacity that could argue for creating a new class.

==Combine fires==
Grain combine fires are responsible for millions of dollars of loss each year. Fires usually start near the engine where dust and dry crop debris accumulate. Fires can also start when heat is introduced by bearings or gearboxes that have failed. From 1984 to 2000, 695 major grain combine fires were reported to U.S. local fire departments. Dragging chains to reduce static electricity was one method employed for preventing harvester fires, but it is not yet clear what if any role static electricity plays in causing harvester fires. The application of appropriate synthetic greases will reduce the friction experienced at crucial points (i.e., chains, sprockets and gear boxes) compared to petroleum based lubricants. Engines with synthetic lubricants will also remain significantly cooler during operation.

==Conversions==
Obsolete or damaged combines can be converted into general utility tractors. This is possible if the relevant systems (cabin, drivetrain, controls and hydraulics) still work or can be repaired. Conversions typically involve removing specialized components for threshing and processing crops; they can also include modifying the frame and controls to better suit operation as a tractor (including lowering it closer to the ground).
 Thresher drives can sometimes be repurposed as power take-offs.

<text>Car Button Cloth is the seventh studio album by the Lemonheads, and the last under their contract with Atlantic Records. The band, as it were, consisted mostly of Dando himself playing many instruments, including his usual guitars and lead vocals, and Patrick Murphy on drums, along with a series of session musicians and producer Bryce Goggin filling in on other instruments. Following the recording of the album, Bill Gibson, who had played bass on several tracks, joined the band for the supporting tour along with Dando and Murphy.

Despite receiving lukewarm reviews and not being as commercially successful as the Lemonheads&#x27; previous two albums, &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot; and &quot;Come On Feel the Lemonheads&quot;, &quot;Car Button Cloth&quot; has gained a minor cult following in recent years. The tracks &quot;It&#x27;s All True,&quot; and &quot;If I Could Talk I&#x27;d Tell You&quot; (cowritten by Eugene Kelly of the Vaselines) were released as singles in Europe. &quot;Purple Parallelogram,&quot; a song written by Dando and Oasis&#x27;s Noel Gallagher, was originally included on promotional copies of &quot;Car Button Cloth&quot; between &quot;Something&#x27;s Missing&quot; and &quot;Knoxville Girl,&quot; but was reportedly removed at Gallagher&#x27;s request. The album would be the last studio release from The Lemonheads for a decade, when they released a long-awaited self-titled follow-up, while in the meantime the group&#x27;s frontman and sole remaining original member, Evan Dando, issued his first official solo album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Bored&quot; (a live album and EP were released in Australia two years earlier).

<doc id="247391" wikidata="Q1165641" url="?curid=247391" title="HMS Ocean (1898)">
<text>HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the British Royal Navy and a member of the . Intended for service in Asia, &quot;Ocean&quot; and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s. &quot;Ocean&quot; was laid down in December 1897, launched in July 1898, and commissioned into the fleet in February 1900.

She entered service with the Mediterranean Fleet until January 1901, when she was transferred to the China Station. &quot;Ocean&quot; was recalled from China in 1905 for service with the Channel Fleet after a period spent in reserve. From 1908 to early 1910, she was again assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. She was assigned to the Home Fleet in 1910 and saw little activity until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. At the start of the conflict, she was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron and was stationed in Ireland to support a cruiser squadron, but in October she was transferred to the East Indies Station to protect troopship convoys from India.

In late 1914, &quot;Ocean&quot; participated in an attack on Basra before being transferred to Egypt to defend the Suez Canal. In February 1915, she was reassigned to the Dardanelles Campaign, and she took part in several attacks on the Ottoman fortifications defending the Dardanelles. On 18 March, she attempted to retrieve the battleship after the latter had been badly damaged by a mine in Erenköy Bay, but had to abandon her salvage efforts due to heavy Ottoman gunfire. She instead evacuated the surviving crew of &quot;Irresistible&quot; but struck a mine while making for the open sea. Badly damaged, her crew and the survivors of &quot;Irresistible&quot; were taken off by destroyers and both battleships sank in Morto Bay.

==Design==


&quot;Ocean&quot; and her five sister ships were designed for service in East Asia, where the new rising power Japan was beginning to build a powerful navy, though this role was quickly made redundant by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. &quot;Ocean&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s.

&quot;Ocean&quot; had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull, two on each broadside near the forward and aft barbette.

To save weight, &quot;Ocean&quot; carried less armour than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s—6 inches in the belt compared to —although the change from Harvey armour in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s to Krupp armour in &quot;Ocean&quot; meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop 12-inch barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Service history==
===Pre-First World War===
HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 15 December 1897, and was the first large armoured ship built at Devonport. She was launched on 5 July 1898, when she was christened by Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne in the presence of the Lords of the Admiralty. Completed in early 1900, &quot;Ocean&quot; was commissioned at Devonport on 20 February 1900 by Captain Assheton Curzon-Howe for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. After a commissioning trial, she left Devonport on 13 March, and arrived at Gibraltar four days later, where she relieved . She served in the Mediterranean Fleet until January 1901, when she was transferred to the China Station in response to the Boxer Uprising. Captain Richard William White was appointed in command in late August 1901. The following year she was reported to visit Port Lazaref (on the Korean peninsula) in October 1902, but she suffered damage in a typhoon, and then underwent a refit that lasted into 1903.

When the United Kingdom and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance in 1905, the Royal Navy reduced its China Station presence and recalled all battleships from the station. As a result, &quot;Ocean&quot; and battleship left Hong Kong in company on 7 June 1905 and called at Singapore, where they rendezvoused with &quot;Ocean&quot;″s sister ships and . The four battleships departed Singapore on 20 June 1905 and steamed home together, arriving at Plymouth on 2 August 1905. &quot;Ocean&quot; went into reserve at Chatham Dockyard.&quot;Ocean&quot; returned to full commission on 2 January 1906 to serve in the Channel Fleet, undergoing refits at Chatham from January–March 1907 and from April–June 1908. On 2 June 1908, &quot;Ocean&quot; recommissioned for duty in the Mediterranean Fleet, undergoing a refit at Malta in 1908–1909, during which she received fire control equipment. &quot;Ocean&quot; transferred to the 4th Division of the new Home Fleet on 16 February 1910. She underwent refits at Chatham in 1910 and 1911–1912. In 1913–1914, she was stationed at Pembroke Dock, Wales, as part of the 3rd Fleet.

===First World War===
When the First World War broke out, &quot;Ocean&quot; was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet, which she joined on 14 August 1914. She was detached to Queenstown, Ireland on 21 August to serve as guard ship there and to support a cruiser squadron operating in that area. In September 1914, she was ordered to relieve her sister ship &quot;Albion&quot; on the Cape Verde-Canary Islands Station, but while en route was diverted, first to Madiera and then to the Azores. The threat of the German East Asia Squadron and the independent cruiser , both of which were still at large, forced the Admiralty to redirect &quot;Ocean&quot; again, to the East Indies Station, to support cruisers on convoy duty in the Middle East. She was joined by the protected cruiser .

From October–December 1914, she served as flagship of the squadron in the Persian Gulf supporting operations against Basra. During this period, she escorted an Indian troop convoy to Bahrain in mid-October; the convoy had departed India on 16 October, and &quot;Ocean&quot; met the convoy at sea three days later to take over escort duties. After the convoy arrived on 3 November, &quot;Ocean&quot; began making preparations for the attack on Basra. Numerous small craft were armed to enter the Shatt al-Arab, the river leading to Basra. The first objective was to silence the old fortress at Al-Faw. On 5 November, Britain declared war on the Ottoman Empire, and the next morning, &quot;Ocean&quot; began the bombardment of Al-Faw. A landing party of 600 men, some of whom came from &quot;Ocean&quot;″s detachment of Royal Marines, stormed the fortress and captured it, having encountered no resistance.

By December 1914, the ground forces &quot;Ocean&quot; supported had advanced to Al-Qurnah, at the juncture of the Euphrates and Tigris, allowing the Admiralty to recall &quot;Ocean&quot; for other purposes. She was accordingly stationed at Suez, Egypt, to assist in the defence of the Suez Canal, arriving there on 29 December. She anchored in the mouth of the southern end of the canal on 29 December and remained in that area until mid-January 1915, when she proceeded northward up the canal. On 3–4 February, she and the armed merchant cruiser &quot;Himalaya&quot; supported ground troops against an Ottoman attack on the canal in the vicinity of El Kubri. Later on the 3rd, after the Ottoman attack at El Kubri had been defeated, &quot;Ocean&quot; was sent to Deversoir to provide artillery support to the garrison there, but Ottoman attacks were insignificant. By the following day, the Ottoman assault had broken down completely.

====Dardanelles campaign and loss====

&quot;Ocean&quot; transferred to the Dardanelles in late February 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles campaign. On 28 February, she took part in an attempt to suppress the Ottoman defences in the Dardanelles led by Admiral John de Robeck; the battleships &quot;Albion&quot; and led the operation, and were tasked with neutralizing the repaired fortress at Dardanus, while &quot;Ocean&quot; and supported them by engaging batteries of mobile field guns that had proved to be troublesome in previous attempts to neutralise the Ottoman defences. &quot;Ocean&quot; initially attempted to locate guns that had been active in the vicinity of Sedd el Bahr, before moving on with &quot;Majestic&quot; and coming under fire from several Ottoman batteries, including howitzers around Erenköy. The British battleships eventually silenced the guns, but only temporarily; as soon as the ships moved on to other targets, the guns opened fire again. In the meantime, &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Triumph&quot; had approached Dardanus but they came under heavy fire from Ottoman guns on the European side of the straits, including the fortress at Erenköy, and were forced to circle to avoid taking hits. Unable to engage Dardanus under these conditions, the ships instead opened fire on the guns at Erenköy, which initially seemed to be effective, as the Ottoman fire slackened. &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; approached in an attempt to attack Dardanus, but they too came under renewed, furious fire from Erenköy, and de Robeck again ordered a withdrawal. The only success came after the four battleships withdrew from the straits and a landing party from &quot;Triumph&quot; went ashore and disabled several light guns. The inability of the British and French fleets to neutralize the mobile field guns convinced the Allied command that the only way forward would be to make a major amphibious assault to clear the guns by land.

She supported the landings at Sedd el Bahr on 4 March. These consisted of two companies of Marines, each landing at their beach. &quot;Ocean&quot; was tasked with supporting the northern company that landed at Sedd el Bahr. The southern group, tasked with capturing the coastal town of Kumkale, came under heavy fire as soon as they went ashore. The northern group encountered similar resistance, but &quot;Ocean&quot;″s gunners, more experienced from their operations of Basra the previous year, proved to be more effective than the other ships. Nevertheless, both companies were forced to withdraw, in large part because they were too small to break through the Ottoman defences. Another bombardment followed on 6 March; &quot;Ocean&quot; and the battleship were tasked with covering the powerful superdreadnought battleship while she engaged the Ottoman artillery batteries. After a day&#x27;s bombardment, the British sent in minesweepers to try to clear the minefields blocking the strait, and &quot;Ocean&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot;, and several destroyers were tasked with protecting them. Despite the heavy bombardment, the Ottoman defenses were largely intact, and even concerted firing from &quot;Ocean&quot; and other ships could not suppress the guns or their search lights. Early on 7 March, the British were forced to withdraw.

On 18 March, the Anglo-French fleet mounted a major attack on the Ottoman defences; &quot;Ocean&quot; joined ten British battleships and one battlecruiser and four French battleships for the operation. The plan called for the battleships to enter the narrows and suppress the fortresses while minesweepers cleared paths in the Ottoman minefields. At the same time, transport ships outside the straits would conduct a demonstration to convince the Ottomans they were going to land troops; the Entente commanders hoped this would tie down the Ottoman mobile guns. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship and then the battlecruiser began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage, and the battleship &quot;Bouvet&quot; struck a mine and exploded. Later in the day, was disabled by a mine in Erenköy Bay. Once it became apparent that the ship could not be saved, all of her surviving crew was taken off by destroyers except for her commanding officer and some volunteers trying to keep her afloat. &quot;Ocean&quot; was sent in to tow her out, but she ran aground during the attempt, and, after freeing herself, found it impossible to take &quot;Irresistible&quot; under tow because of the shallow water, &quot;Irresistible&quot;″s increasing list, and heavy enemy fire. &quot;Ocean&quot; then took off the remaining members of &quot;Irresistible&quot;″s crew and left the abandoned battleship to her fate; &quot;Irresistible&quot; sank unobserved by Allied forces, at around 19:30.

While retiring with &quot;Irresistible&quot;″s survivors aboard, &quot;Ocean&quot; herself was hit by an artillery shell fired by Seyit Çabuk, an Ottoman Army gunner, and struck a drifting mine at around 19:00. Her starboard coal bunkers and passageways flooded, her steering jammed hard to port, and she took on a list of 15° to starboard. She came under fire from shore and began taking hits, which flooded her starboard engine room and prevented steering repairs. The destroyers , , and came alongside and took off her crew (and the survivors from &quot;Irresistible&quot;) at around 19:30. She then drifted into Morto Bay, still under fire, and sank there unobserved by Allied forces at about 22:30. When destroyer &quot;Jed&quot; entered the bay later that evening to sink &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;Irresistible&quot; with torpedoes so that they could not be captured by Ottoman forces, the two battleships were nowhere to be found.

<text>In mathematics, the uniform boundedness principle or Banach–Steinhaus theorem is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. 
Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. 
In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.

The theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus, but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.

==Theorem==

The first inequality (that is, formula_1 for all formula_2) states that the functionals in formula_3 are pointwise bounded while the second states that they are uniformly bounded. 
The second supremum always equals
formula_4
and if formula_5 is not the trivial vector space (or if the supremum is taken over formula_6 rather than formula_7) then closed unit ball can be replaced with the unit sphere
formula_8

The completeness of the Banach space formula_5 enables the following short proof, using the Baire category theorem.

There are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem .

==Corollaries==

The above corollary does claim that formula_10 converges to formula_11 in operator norm, that is, uniformly on bounded sets. However, since formula_12 is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator formula_11 is continuous, a standard &quot;formula_14&quot; estimate shows that formula_10 converges to formula_11 uniformly on sets.

Indeed, the elements of formula_17 define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space formula_18 which is the continuous dual space of formula_19 
By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of formula_20 as functionals on formula_21 that is, norms in the second dual formula_22 are bounded. 
But for every formula_23 the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in formula_24 by a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem.

Let formula_25 denote the continuous operators from formula_5 to formula_24 endowed with the operator norm. 
If the collection formula_3 is unbounded in formula_29 then the uniform boundedness principle implies:
formula_30

In fact, formula_31 is dense in formula_32 The complement of formula_31 in formula_5 is the countable union of closed sets formula_35
By the argument used in proving the theorem, each formula_36 is nowhere dense, i.e. the subset formula_37 is . 
Therefore formula_31 is the complement of a subset of first category in a Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called or ) are dense. 
Such reasoning leads to the , which can be formulated as follows:

==Example: pointwise convergence of Fourier series==

Let formula_39 be the circle, and let formula_40 be the Banach space of continuous functions on formula_41 with the uniform norm. Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that there exists an element in formula_40 for which the Fourier series does not converge pointwise.

For formula_43 its Fourier series is defined by
formula_44
and the &quot;N&quot;-th symmetric partial sum is
formula_45
where formula_46 is the formula_47-th Dirichlet kernel. Fix formula_48 and consider the convergence of formula_49 
The functional formula_50 defined by
formula_51
is bounded. 
The norm of formula_52 in the dual of formula_53 is the norm of the signed measure formula_54 namely
formula_55

It can be verified that
formula_56

So the collection formula_57 is unbounded in formula_58 the dual of formula_59 
Therefore, by the uniform boundedness principle, for any formula_60 the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at formula_2 is dense in formula_59

More can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. 
Let formula_63 be a dense sequence in formula_64 
Define formula_65 in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each formula_66 is dense in formula_40 (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function formula_68 converges to formula_69 for almost every formula_60 by Carleson&#x27;s theorem).

==Generalizations==

In a topological vector space (TVS) formula_21 &quot;bounded subset&quot; refers specifically to the notion of a von Neumann bounded subset. If formula_5 happens to also be a normed or seminormed space, say with (semi)norm formula_73 then a subset formula_74 is (von Neumann) bounded if and only if it is , which by definition means formula_75

===Barrelled spaces===
Attempts to find classes of locally convex topological vector spaces on which the uniform boundedness principle holds eventually led to barrelled spaces. 
That is, the least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a barrelled space, where the following generalized version of the theorem holds :

===Uniform boundedness in topological vector spaces===

A family formula_76 of subsets of a topological vector space formula_77 is said to be in formula_24 if there exists some bounded subset formula_79 of formula_77 such that 
formula_81
which happens if and only if 
formula_82 
is a bounded subset of formula_77; 
if formula_77 is a normed space then this happens if and only if there exists some real formula_85 such that formula_86 
In particular, if formula_87 is a family of maps from formula_5 to formula_77 and if formula_90 then the family formula_91 is uniformly bounded in formula_77 if and only if there exists some bounded subset formula_79 of formula_77 such that formula_95 which happens if and only if formula_96 is a bounded subset of formula_19

===Generalizations involving nonmeager subsets===

Although the notion of a nonmeager set is used in the following version of the uniform bounded principle, the domain formula_5 is assumed to be a Baire space.

Every proper vector subspace of a TVS formula_5 has an empty interior in formula_32 So in particular, every proper vector subspace that is closed is nowhere dense in formula_5 and thus of the first category (meager) in formula_5 (and the same is thus also true of all its subsets). 
Consequently, any vector subspace of a TVS formula_5 that is of the second category (nonmeager) in formula_5 must be a dense subset of formula_5 (since otherwise its closure in formula_5 would a closed proper vector subspace of formula_5 and thus of the first category).

===Sequences of continuous linear maps===

The following theorem establishes conditions for the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous linear maps to be itself continuous.

If in addition the domain is a Banach space and the codomain is a normed space then formula_108

====Complete metrizable domain====

 proves a weaker form of this theorem with Fréchet spaces rather than the usual Banach spaces.

<text>Milano Centrale () is the main railway station of the city of Milan, Italy, and is the second busiest railway station in Italy for passenger flow (after Roma Termini) and the largest railway station in Europe by volume. 

The station is a terminus and located at the northern end of central Milan. It was officially inaugurated in 1931 to replace the old central station (built 1864), which was a transit station that could not handle the increased traffic caused by the opening of the Simplon Tunnel in 1906 due to the old station&#x27;s limited number of tracks and space.

Milano Centrale has high-speed connections to Turin in the west, Venice via Verona in the east and on the north–south mainline to Bologna, Rome, Naples and Salerno. The Simplon and Gotthard railway lines connect Milano Centrale to Basel and Geneva via Domodossola and Zürich via Chiasso in Switzerland.

Destinations of inter-city and regional railways radiate from Milano Centrale to Ventimiglia (border of France), Genova, Turin, Domodossola (border of Swiss Canton of Valais/Wallis), Tirano (border of Swiss Canton of Graubünden/Grisons), Bergamo, Verona, Mantova, Bologna and La Spezia.

The Milan suburban railway service, however, does not use Milano Centrale but the other mainline stations: Porta Garibaldi (northwest), Cadorna (west) and Rogoredo (east).

Architect Aldo Rossi declared in an interview of February 1995 to Cecilia Bolognesi: &quot;They told me that when Frank Lloyd Wright came to Milan, and he came only once, he was really impressed by it and said it was the most beautiful station in the world. For me it is also more beautiful than Grand Central Station in New York. I know few stations like this one&quot;.

==History==
The first Milano Centrale station opened in 1864 in the area now occupied by the &quot;Piazza della Repubblica&quot;, south of the modern station. It was designed by French architect Louis-Jules Bouchot (1817–1907) and its architectural style was reminiscent of Parisian buildings of that period. The station was designed to replace &quot;Porta Tosa station&quot; (opened in 1846 as the terminus of the line to Treviglio and eventually Venice) and &quot;Porta Nuova station&quot; (opened in 1850 as the second terminus on the line to Monza, which was eventually extended to Chiasso) and was interconnected with all lines, either existing or under construction, surrounding Milan. It remained in operation until 30 June 1931, when the current station was opened. There is now no trace of the old station left.

King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy laid the cornerstone of the new station on 28 April 1906, before a blueprint for the station had even been chosen. The last, real, contest for its construction was won in 1912 by architect Ulisse Stacchini, who titled his project &quot;In Motu Vita,&quot; meaning &quot;Life in Motion&quot; in Latin. His proposal was given unanimous approval by the commission gathered to judge the competition. The purported style was an eclectic mix called &quot;Assyrian-Lombard.&quot;

Due to the Italian economic crisis during World War I, construction proceeded very slowly. Stacchini made multiple revisions to the project, mainly to quell concerns by the Milan city government about high construction costs. Benito Mussolini&#x27;s ascention to the position of Prime Minister was the catalyst behind the resumption of work in 1925, as multiple public works projects were accelerated in order to bolster the reception of the Fascist government&#x27;s ability to effectively manage national projects. The major changes were the new platform types and the introduction of the great steel canopies by Alberto Fava; long and covering an area of .

Construction resumed in 1925, and on 1 July 1931 the station was officially opened in the presence of Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano.

The station played a major role during the Holocaust in Italy, when Jewish inmates from the San Vittore Prison, previously captured in northern Italy, would be taken to a secret track, &quot;Binario 21&quot;, underneath the station to be deported to extermination camps. Altogether, 15 deportation trains with 1,200 prisoners left the station from &quot;Binario 21&quot;. A &quot;Memoriale della Shoah&quot; was opened at the former platform in January 2013 to commemorate these events.

Its façade is wide and its vault is high, a record when it was built. It has 24 platforms. Each day about 330,000 passengers use the station, totaling about 120 million per year.

The station has no definite architectural style, but is a blend of many different styles, especially Liberty and Art Deco, but not limited to those. It is adorned with numerous sculptures. &quot;The &#x27;incongruous envelope of stone&#x27; (Attilio Pracchi) of this gigantic and monumental building dominates Piazza Duca d&#x27;Aosta.&quot;

On 25 September 2006 officials announced a €100 million project, already in progress, to refurbish the station. Of the total cost, €20 million has been allocated to restore &quot;certain areas of high artistic value&quot; while the remaining €80 million will be used for more general improvements to the station to make it more functional with the current railway services. The project includes moving the ticket office and installing new elevators and escalators for increased accessibility.

There remain unrestored and inaccessible areas to the public within the station, including a waiting room with swastikas on the floor designed to receive Adolf Hitler.

===Platforms===

The station, along with Roma Termini and Firenze Santa Maria Novella, has security gates, normally free flowing, though supervised by agents.

Each platform is usually dedicated to some particular route. The current organization is as follows, although temporary changes may occur.
* Platforms 1-3: Chiasso/Domodossola/Milan-Turin (AV FR), Milan-Malpensa airport train
* Platforms 4-6: Turin / Milan–Como–Arth Goldau–Basel / Zürich
* Platforms 7-13: Venice / Udine
* Platforms 14-17: Bologna–Florence–Rome–Naples

===Unusual track layout===
On the northern side of the railway yard, there used to be a loop curve so that trains could turn around and reverse back into the station. The trains could so be displaced from the left side of the station to the right side and vice versa without crossing all the tracks. The tracks on the loop curve are now partially broken up.

<text>Short Ride in a Fast Machine is a 1986 orchestral work by John Adams. Adams applies the description &quot;fanfare for orchestra&quot; to this work and to the earlier &quot;Tromba Lontana&quot; (1986). The former is also known as &quot;Fanfare for Great Woods&quot; because it was commissioned for the Great Woods Festival of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

As a commentary on the title, Adams inquires, &quot;You know how it is when someone asks you to ride in a terrific sports car, and then you wish you hadn&#x27;t?&quot; The work is an example of Adams&#x27;s postminimal style, which is utilized in other works like &quot;Phrygian Gates&quot;, &quot;Shaker Loops&quot;, and &quot;Nixon in China&quot;. This style derives from minimalism as defined by the works of Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and Philip Glass, although it proceeds to &quot;make use of minimalist techniques in more dramatic settings.&quot;

A typical performance of &quot;Short Ride&quot; lasts about four and a half minutes.

==Popularity, performance and cancellations==
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra premiered &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot; in 1986.

The fanfare was the 10th most-performed orchestral work composed in the last twenty-five years, in 2008.

The work was performed at the BBC Proms in 2004, 2014 and 2019. Scheduled performances at the Last Night of the Proms were cancelled twice: in 1997 after the death of Princess Diana, and in 2001 after the September 11 attacks.

Lawrence Odom transcribed the piece for concert band.

The piano duo of Christina and Michelle Naughton open their album &quot;American Postcard&quot; with the piece, in a two piano arrangement by Preben Antonsen.

==Orchestra==
The piece is scored for the following large orchestra:

;Woodwinds
:2 piccolos
:2 flutes
:2 oboes
:1 English horn
:2 (optional 4) clarinets in A and B
:3 bassoons
:1 contrabassoon

;Brass
:4 horns in F
:4 trumpets in C
:3 trombones
:1 tuba

;Percussion
:timpani

;Keyboards
: 2 synthesizers with &quot;analog brass&quot; preset (optional)

;Strings
:violins I, II
:violas
:cellos
:double basses
==Style and analysis==
===Harmonic devices===
&quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot;, true to its minimalist heritage, utilizes a tonal language that, according to Catherine Pellegrino, &quot;is not as neatly defined and predictable as that of common-practice tonality&quot;. Adams is known (especially in &quot;Phrygian Gates&quot;) for the concept of &quot;gating&quot;, which is the process of suddenly changing certain pitches in a harmony, often based on different modes.

As seen in Example 1, the initial pitch collection of D, E, and A, as scored in the clarinets and optional synthesizers, slowly transforms over time by adding pitches. This process is a concept of changing harmony, which Adams describes as &quot;bring[ing] in a new key area almost on the sly, stretching the ambiguity out over such a length of time that the listener would hardly notice that a change had taken place&quot;. By measure 52, the aggregate of pitches suddenly shifts as the E major chord is replaced by a B-flat major chord. Meanwhile, the original pitch collection continues to exist as an unchanging force. This process is the main harmonic device that Adams employs, as the next section shifts pitch collections more rapidly for contrast, while other sections return to the pace of the first section.

===Rhythmic devices===
In its rhythm, this work adheres to the main precepts of minimalism, one of which is the use of repeated material, generally in the form of ostinati. Minimalism also favours a strong sense of pulse, which Adams emphasizes strongly in &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot; in his scoring of the wood block. Adams claims that &quot;I need to experience that fundamental tick&quot; in his work. Throughout the course of the work, Adams experiments with the idea of rhythmic dissonance as material begins to appear, initially in the trumpets, and generates a new sense of pulse. As shown below, the manifestation of rhythmic dissonance is akin to Adams&#x27;s method of creating harmonic dissonance as he adds conflicting rhythms to disrupt the metronomic stability of the wood block. Adams himself admits that he seeks to &quot;enrich the experience of perceiving the way that time is divided&quot; within his works. Later in the work, (see Example 5) Adams introduces a simple polyrhythm as a means of initiating a new section that contrasts the rhythmic dissonance of the first section.


===Formal devices===
The idea of formal closure and rhetorical devices in a sense of common practice is skewed in the works of John Adams, especially in &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot;. While works of common practice organize material by phrases which are separated by cadential material, this work is in a state of perpetual motion as the additive element of harmonic and rhythmic material drives the work forward. The &quot;gating&quot; concept gives the overall work a sense of sectional design, but the indication of termination through cadence is something that is absent from the work until the very end, which emulates a ii–V–I cadence.

In terms of defining the sections of the work, the wood block is scored in a way that creates a four-part form. The first and third parts of the work have a high wood block present in the scoring, which is contrasted by a low wood block in the second part, while the final part features the absence of wood block.

<text>The rosefinches are a genus, Carpodacus, of passerine birds in the finch family Fringillidae. Most are called &quot;rosefinches&quot; and as the word implies, have various shades of red in their plumage. The common rosefinch is frequently called the &quot;rosefinch&quot;. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek terms &quot;karpos&quot;, &quot;fruit&quot;, and &quot;dakno&quot;, &quot;to bite&quot;.

The &quot;Carpodacus&quot; rosefinches occur throughout Eurasia, but the greatest diversity is found in the Sino-Himalayas suggesting that the species originated in this region.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Carpodacus&quot; was introduced in 1829 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The type species was designated by George Gray in 1842 as &quot;Fringilla rosea&quot; Pallas, 1776, Pallas&#x27;s rosefinch. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot; karpos&quot; meaning &quot;fruit&quot; with &quot;dakos&quot; meaning &quot;biter&quot;.

In 2012, Zuccon and colleagues published a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of the finch family. Based both on their own results and those published earlier by other groups, they proposed a series of changes to the taxonomy. They found that the three North American rosefinches, namely Cassin&#x27;s finch, purple finch, and house finch, formed a separate clade that was not closely related to the Palearctic rosefinches. They proposed moving the three species to a separate genus &quot;Haemorhous&quot;. This proposal was accepted by the International Ornithological Committee and the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union. Zuccon and colleagues also found that the common rosefinch (&quot;Carpodacus erythrinus&quot;) fell outside the core rosefinch clade and was a sister to the scarlet finch (at the time &quot;Haematospiza sipahi&quot;). They recommended that the common rosefinch should be moved to a new monotypic genus with the resurrected name of &quot;Erythrina&quot;. The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union accepted this proposal, but the International Ornithological Union chose instead to adopt a more inclusive &quot;Carpodacus&quot; which incorporated &quot;Haematospiza&quot; as well as the monotypic genus &quot;Chaunoproctus&quot; containing the extinct Bonin grosbeak. The long-tailed rosefinch that had previously been included in the monotypic genus &quot;Uragus&quot; was also moved into &quot;Carpodacus&quot;.

Two species that were formerly included in the genus, Blanford&#x27;s rosefinch and the dark-breasted rosefinch, were shown to not be closely related to the other species in the group. They were moved to separate monotypic genera, Blanford&#x27;s rosefinch to &quot;Agraphospiza&quot; and the dark-breasted rosefinch to &quot;Procarduelis&quot;. Sillem&#x27;s rosefinch originally had the common name &quot;Sillem&#x27;s mountain finch&quot; and was assigned to the genus &quot;Leucosticte&quot; but a phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2016 found that the species belonged to the genus &quot;Carpodacus&quot;.

There have been a number of rosefinch radiations. First to split off were the ancestors of the North American species, the common rosefinch, and the scarlet finch, generally placed in its own genus. These groups, which may be related, diverged in the Middle Miocene (about 14–12 mya) from the proto-rosefinches. Each of these groups probably should constitute a distinct genus; in the case of the North American species, this is &quot;Haemorhous&quot;. The types of the genera &quot;Erythrina&quot; Brehm 1829 and &quot;Carpodacus&quot; Kaup 1829 are frequently considered to be the common rosefinch, but both refer to Pallas&#x27;s rosefinch.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Hawaiian honeycreepers are closely related to the rosefinches in the genus &quot;Carpodacus&quot;. The most recent common ancestor has been variously estimate at 7.24 million years ago (mya) and 15.71 mya.

Przewalski&#x27;s &quot;rosefinch&quot; (&quot;Urocynchramus pylzowi&quot;) has been determined to be not a rosefinch, and indeed not a true finch at all, but to constitute a monotypic family Urocynchramidae.

== Species ==
The genus &quot;Carpodacus&quot; contains 28 species. They all include &#x27;rosefinch&#x27; in their English names apart from the scarlet finch, the crimson-browed finch and the extinct Bonin grosbeak.

<text>HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; was a Royal Navy light fleet aircraft carrier of 13,190 tons built in Glasgow by Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons. Her keel was laid in November 1942, and she was commissioned on 8 August 1945.

==Construction and design==
The &quot;Colossus&quot; class was a class of relatively small aircraft carriers which were designed to be built quickly to meet the Royal Navy&#x27;s requirements for more carriers to allow it to fight a global war. In order to allow speedy build, they were designed to mercantile rather than navy hull standards, while armour protection and long-range anti aircraft guns were not fitted. Sixteen ships were ordered by the end of 1942, but the last six were completed to a modified design as the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class.

The ships were between and long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. Beam was and draught was at deep load. Displacement was standard and deep load. Four Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam to two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines which in turn drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . The ships had a range of at a speed of .

The flight deck was long and wide, while the hangar was long and wide with a clear overhead height of . While designed to carry 24 aircraft in 1942, by the time that they became operational, the ships were accommodating 37 aircraft. &quot;Ocean&quot; was fitted with a close-in anti-aircraft armament of six quadruple and seven single 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom autocannon and twelve single Bofors 40 mm guns. The ship had a crew of 1300 officers and ratings.

&quot;Ocean&quot; was laid down at Alexander Stephen &amp; Sons Glasgow shipyard on 8 November 1942 and was launched on 8 July 1944. In March 1944, a request was made by the Australian government to obtain a light fleet carrier and 6inch cruisers. The Royal Navy put forward &quot;Ocean&quot; as being available for purchase however in mid 1945 the RAN decided not to pursue the purchase due to manpower shortages during the war. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 8 August 1945. In total, the ship required 20772 man-months to build.

==Service==

Following commissioning, &quot;Ocean&quot; was sent to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for modification to operate night fighters - changes included revised radar (with American SM-1 radar replacing the British Type 277 height-finding radar) and improved direction-finding equipment. On completion of these changes in November 1945, &quot;Ocean&quot; was based at Rosyth for flying trials, with the first trials of the de Havilland Sea Hornet twin-engine fighter and the last carrier operations of the Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bomber. On 3 December 1945, a Sea Vampire flown by Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown made the first ever carrier landing of a purely jet-powered aircraft onto &quot;Ocean&quot; (although earlier that year a composite jet and piston engined Ryan FR-1 Fireball had made a carrier landing under jet power after its radial engine failed.)

In December 1945, &quot;Ocean&quot; transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, with an air group consisting of the Supermarine Seafire-equipped 805 Naval Air Squadron and 816 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with Fairey Firefly night fighters. She disembarked her air group at Malta in June 1946 to allow her to be used as a troopship to carry troops to Singapore. In October 1946 she provided fire-fighting and medical support to the two destroyers and when they struck mines in the Corfu Channel incident. In May 1948, she formed part of the task force supporting the withdrawal of British forces from Palestine, providing air cover after RAF bases in Palestine had been evacuated.

&quot;Ocean&quot; twice deployed to Korea, firstly from May to October 1952 and then from May to November 1953. In August 1952 a formation of Hawker Sea Fury aircraft from the carrier engaged North Korean MiG-15 jets in air combat, shooting one down.

In August 1954 she joined the Home Fleet&#x27;s training squadron but saw an active role in the Suez crisis. In the first ever large-scale helicopter borne assault, Westland Whirlwind and Bristol Sycamore helicopters from &quot;Ocean&quot; and landed 425 men of 45 Commando and 23 tons of stores into Port Said in 90 minutes. After Suez, the ship did not see much more active service. In October 1957, Ocean transported the Band of the Royal Marines, a party of Green Howards plus Admiral Lord Fraser of the North Cape as the Queen&#x27;s representative to the funeral of King Haakon VII in Oslo. In September 1957, the Soviet Union protested when accompanied &quot;Ocean&quot; on a visit to Helsinki. She went into extended reserve in 1958 and was scrapped in 1962 at Faslane.

In his book on the Hungarian Revolution, Peter Fryer briefly refers to the &quot;arrest of twelve British seamen in the aircraft carrier Ocean, following unlawful meetings&quot; in October 1956.

<text>HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; was a Landing Platform Helicopter, formerly the UK&#x27;s helicopter carrier and the fleet flagship of the Royal Navy. She was designed to support amphibious landing operations and to support the staff of Commander UK Amphibious Force and Commander UK Landing Force. She was constructed in the mid-1990s by Kvaerner Govan on the River Clyde and fitted out by VSEL at Barrow-in-Furness prior to trials and subsequent acceptance in service. &quot;Ocean&quot; was commissioned in September 1998 at her home port HMNB Devonport, Plymouth.

In December 2017, the Brazilian Navy confirmed the purchase of the ship for £84.6 million. Following her decommissioning from Royal Navy service on 27 March 2018, she arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 25 August 2018, with the intention of being commissioned as &quot;Atlântico&quot; and fully operational by 2020.

==Background==
An invitation to tender for a new helicopter carrier was issued in February 1992. In February 1993 &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the carrier faced cancellation due to budgetary constraints. However, at approximately the same time, British forces were engaged in operations in the Balkans, which saw the Royal Fleet Auxiliary&#x27;s aviation training ship RFA &quot;Argus&quot; pressed into service as an amphibious transport ship. &quot;Argus&quot;″s accommodation and facilities proved inadequate for the needs of a large Embarked Military Force (EMF), which emphasised the need for a purpose-built platform. On 29 March 1993, the defence procurement minister announced that development of the new Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) was proceeding. Two shipbuilders tendered for the contract – Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (VSEL) and Swan Hunter. On 11 May 1993, the government announced that VSEL had won the contract. The build was to commercial standards, reducing costs significantly and leading to a construction spend of £154 million (£ in ), comparable to that of a Type 23 frigate. VSEL, a warship manufacturer, sub-contracted the build phase to the commercial Kværner yard in Govan, Glasgow.

That VSEL&#x27;s bid was £71 million lower than Swan Hunter&#x27;s was the source of political controversy and led to a National Audit Office investigation to determine whether the competition was fair. The report, published on 29 July 1993, stated that, although VSEL did subsidise its bid, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) was right to award the contract to VSEL because the subsidy was much smaller than the difference between the two bids; VSEL&#x27;s bid was £139.5 million compared to Swan Hunter&#x27;s £210.6 million. &quot;The Times&quot; also suggested that the subsidy was as little as £10 million. In anticipation of the report, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; described the different philosophies adopted by the two bidders; while Swan Hunter viewed the ship as entirely military, &quot;VSEL thought the design was basically a merchant ship with military hardware bolted on.&quot; VSEL&#x27;s decision to sub-contract the build phase took advantage of lower overheads at a civilian yard as well as efficiency drives by its parent, Kværner.

Launched on 11 October 1995, she was subsequently named at Barrow by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 February 1998, prior to delivery to Devonport. In her sea trial, she reached a maximum speed of ; however, her usual top speed is .

==Role==
&quot;Ocean&quot; was designed to provide the amphibious assault capabilities last offered by and . She can deploy an Embarked Military Force (EMF) of a Royal Marines Commando Group from 3 Commando Brigade supported by aircraft and landing craft. The ship&#x27;s company included 9 Assault Squadron (9 ASRM) from 1 Assault Group Royal Marines whose primary role is as an Amphibious Assault Squadron. Secondary tasks include boarding parties, beach reconnaissance and providing amphibious knowledge to the ships Command. Besides these roles they have responsibilities within the ship which include firefighting, watchkeeping and security. 9 ASRM is divided into a HQ unit, Landing Craft Troop, Signals detachment, Vehicle Deck Party and Assault Supply Team.

HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; was also capable of limited anti-submarine warfare activities, supporting afloat training and acting as a base facility for other embarked forces including counter-terrorism units.

The ship was capable of carrying four to six Westland Apache AH1 helicopters operated by the Army Air Corps, as well as helicopters of the Fleet Air Arm (Seaking Mk4) and Royal Air Force, including the larger twin-rotor Boeing Chinook transports. Prior to their retirement, &quot;Ocean&quot; could transport up to fifteen fixed-wing Harrier V/STOL aircraft of Joint Force Harrier in the ferry role, but was unable to operate as a fixed-wing aircraft carrier because she lacked the ski jump that is needed to launch a fully loaded Harrier.

For the 2012 London Olympics, she carried four Army Air Corps and four Fleet Air Arm Westland Super Lynx helicopters, to deploy special forces and conduct other missions in a security role.

Four Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs) were permanently embarked and manned by 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines.

==Operational history==
===1998–2000===

Weeks after being commissioned, &quot;Ocean&quot; was undertaking the warm water element of her first-of-class trials, when she was deployed on short notice to the coasts of Honduras and Nicaragua to provide humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. In early 1999, &quot;Ocean&quot; was scheduled to take part in an exercise in the Atlantic, but was diverted to the Mediterranean in readiness for possible deployment to Kosovo.

During 2000, &quot;Ocean&quot; supported Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone, joining in aiding the suppression of rebel activity with her own embarked force, and providing support facilities for the Spearhead battalion ashore.

===2001–2010===
On 17 February 2002, whilst under command of Captain Adrian Johns, a unit of Royal Marines from &quot;Ocean&quot; accidentally landed on the San Felipe beach in the Spanish town of La Linea instead of Gibraltar, causing a minor diplomatic incident as various media outlets labelled the mistake as an &quot;invasion&quot;.

&quot;Ocean&quot; was the flagship and spearpoint of a large Royal Navy task force deployed for Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the 2003 Iraq War, for which she was awarded a new battle honour &quot;Al Faw 2003&quot;. In the helicopter assault role she was accompanied by .

She was awarded the Freedom of the City of Sunderland on 26 July 2004.

In the summer of 2006, under the command of Captain Christopher Clayton, the ship was deployed as part of the task force involved in the Aurora exercises on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Clayton was later succeeded by Captain Tony Johnstone-Burt.

In 2007, &quot;Ocean&quot; began her first long refit period. This was carried out by Devonport Management Limited at their Devonport Royal Dockyard facility and lasted around 12 months. Following this major period of maintenance and upgrading work, &quot;Ocean&quot; sailed from Plymouth on Wednesday 24 September 2008 to start sea trials. As part of that upgrade, a PyTEC pyrolysising waste recycling unit was fitted.

On 18 February 2009, &quot;Ocean&quot; sailed from Devonport as part of the &quot;Taurus 09&quot; deployment. She was joined on this deployment by the landing platform dock , as the flagship of the group, which included Type 23 Frigates and and four ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. This exercise was filmed for the second series of the Channel 5 documentary &quot;Warship&quot;. In June 2009, &quot;Ocean&quot; took part in exercise Bersama Shield with HMS &quot;Somerset&quot; and off the Malay Peninsula.

During the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, Prime Minister Gordon Brown assigned &quot;Ocean&quot; and other units to rescue stranded travellers and army personnel across the English Channel in Operation Cunningham.

In 2010, the ship was sent on a multi-purpose deployment. This started with exercise Auriga on the eastern coast of the US. She then moved to Brazil to conduct an exercise with the Brazilian marines; whilst there a defence co-operation agreement was signed on board. She then crossed the Atlantic to Nigeria to participate in the &quot;Nigeria at 50&quot; presidential fleet review and provide training to the Nigerian navy as part of the African partnership programme. She returned to Devonport in November.

===2011–2018===
In April 2011, while under command of Captain Keith Blount, the ship took part in the COUGAR 11 deployment under the ultimate command of Commander Amphibious Task Group (CATG). During this deployment, she took part in Exercise Cypriot Lion.

In May 2011, she was detached from CATG&#x27;s COUGAR 11 deployment and sent with embarked Apaches to aid operations in Libya along with the attack helicopters aboard the French amphibious assault ship &quot;Tonnerre&quot; (L9014). This was the first time that Apache helicopters were sent directly into action from a Royal Navy ship. Her initial complement of three Apaches was bolstered by a fourth soon after, and later a fifth. The deployment included a large medical team, a sign of the ship&#x27;s flexibility.

On 4 May 2012, she moored at Greenwich to prepare for her role of providing logistics support, accommodation and a helicopter landing site during the London 2012 Olympic Games. From 24 to 28 May 2012, she visited Sunderland, her affiliated port, and made other port calls before returning to London on 13 July. After Olympic duty, &quot;Ocean&quot; returned to her home port of HMNB Devonport for a scheduled period of maintenance. The LPH role was provided by until 2014. On 22 July 2014, &quot;Ocean&quot; took over the helicopter carrier role again, after her 15-month, £65 million refit, replacing &quot;Illustrious&quot;, which then returned to her home port Portsmouth for the last time, being decommissioned on 28 August 2014. As part of the Response Force Task Group COUGAR 14 deployment, &quot;Ocean&quot; participated in exercises off Albania and France.

In April 2015 &quot;Ocean&quot; took part in Exercise Joint Warrior 15-1 around the coast of Scotland, with Wildcat helicopters landing on her for the first time. She then stopped again in Sunderland where the ship&#x27;s company exercised their right to the freedom of the city, with more than 300 officers and ratings parading through the city centre.

&quot;Ocean&quot; became the Royal Navy Fleet Flagship in June 2015. In December 2015, she returned to port after Exercise COUGAR 15, an amphibious warfare exercise in the Mediterranean with the French Navy.

In September 2016, &quot; Ocean &quot; left Devonport for the inaugural Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) (JEF(M)) Task Group deployment which is the successor to the annual Cougar deployments. The bulk of this deployment took place East of Suez and demonstrated the UK&#x27;s ongoing ability to deploy highly effective and combat capable maritime forces anywhere in the world.
The core task group included the LSD RFA &quot;Mounts Bay&quot; (L3008), MOD strategic Ro-Ro vessel and . Elements of the Royal Marines 42 Commando, were spread across the force. Frigates and Destroyers from the Royal Navy and French Navy joined throughout the deployment.
On the 60th anniversary of Operation Musketeer, &quot;Ocean&quot; became the flagship of COMATG. This marked the end of the JEF(M) deployment.

On 25 November, the ship rendezvoused with . COMATG assumed command of the U.S. Task Force 50, becoming Commander, Task Force 50 (CTF 50). Due to the U.S. Navy gap in carrier coverage in the Middle East, this was the first time a Royal Navy vessel had commanded the U.S. formation responsible for maritime war fighting in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulfs of Aden and Oman and the Indian Ocean. On 24 March &quot;Ocean&quot; returned to Devonport. During the deployment she steamed 23,000 miles, visited 11 countries, provided a platform for six British ambassadors and High Commissioners and was home to up to 1150 service personnel.

At the end of August 2017, &quot;Ocean&quot; left Devonport for her final deployment, scheduled to take over as Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 flagship in the Mediterranean. Before she could relieve with SNMG2, &quot;Ocean&quot; was redeployed to assist in disaster relief efforts following Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean, and then the subsequent Hurricane Maria.

&quot;Ocean&quot; was decommissioned on 27 March 2018 at HMNB Devonport, with Queen Elizabeth II attending the ceremony.

==Sale to Brazil==
Brazil, seeking a replacement for their navy&#x27;s outgoing flagship, NAe &quot;São Paulo&quot;, began negotiations with the United Kingdom in 2017 to purchase &quot;Ocean&quot; for £84.3 million (312 million Brazilian Reais), following her decommissioning in 2018. An agreement was struck and, after being transferred to Brazil, the former &quot;HMS Ocean&quot; was commissioned as &quot;Atlântico&quot; in June 2018. She has since been the flagship of the Brazilian Navy.

Initially being designated with the initials PHM (&quot;Porta Helicópteros Multipropósito&quot;, Multipurpose Helicopter Carrier), the ship&#x27;s designation was changed to NAM (&quot;Navio Aeródromo Multipropósito&quot;, Multipurpose Aircraft Carrier) in 12 November 2020 due to her ability to host UAVs and VTOL aircraft.

<doc id="247401" wikidata="Q2334861" url="?curid=247401" title="Little Games">
<text>Little Games is the fourth American album by the English rock band the Yardbirds. Recorded and released in 1967, it was their first album recorded after becoming a quartet with Jimmy Page as the sole guitarist and Chris Dreja switching to bass. It was also the only Yardbirds album produced by Mickie Most.

Although the new lineup was becoming more experimental with longer, improvised concert performances, the Yardbirds&#x27; record company brought in successful singles producer Most to coax out more commercial product. However, neither material that properly presented their new approach nor hit singles were forthcoming. The release of the title track &quot;Little Games&quot; that preceded the album did not reach the singles chart in the UK and consequently the album was not released there. However, the album saw limited release in the US, Germany, and New Zealand, but only reached number 80 in the US.

&quot;Little Games&quot; became the Yardbirds&#x27; final studio album, although Most continued to produce singles for the group. These were later collected and released with the original album along with outtakes and alternate mixes on an expanded edition titled &quot;Little Games Sessions &amp; More&quot; in 1992.

==Background==
After the commercially and critically successful Yardbirds&#x27; albums &quot;Having a Rave Up with The Yardbirds&quot; (1965) and &quot;Yardbirds/Over Under Sideways Down&quot; aka &quot;Roger the Engineer&quot; (1966), founder member and bassist/musical director Paul Samwell-Smith left the group to pursue a career as a record producer. He was replaced on bass by studio guitarist Jimmy Page, whom the Yardbirds had originally approached to replace Eric Clapton. Page&#x27;s position as bassist was temporary and within a short while he switched to second lead guitarist alongside Jeff Beck, with rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja taking over on bass. In 1966, the Beck/Page dual lead guitar line-up produced the psychedelic &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;, &quot;Psycho Daisies&quot; and &quot;Stroll On&quot;, the updated remake of &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; for their appearance in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;Blow-Up&quot;. However, by the end of 1966, Beck was fired from the band due to an illness that was preventing him from playing gigs while on tour in the US, and they continued as a quartet with Page as the sole guitarist.

During 1966 and 1967, much of the rock audience began to shift interest from Top 40 singles to albums and concert presentations. During this period, the Yardbirds toured the US extensively, with frequent shows at popular counterculture venues such as the Fillmore. They became more experimental, with longer, improvised sets including light shows, film clips, and audio samples. Their material became more varied and introduced songs such as &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, the Jimmy Page solo-guitar piece &quot;White Summer&quot;, the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;, and extended medleys with re-worked versions of &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; and &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;.

Despite this change in direction, Mickie Most, best known for producing hits for Herman&#x27;s Hermits and Donovan, was brought in by EMI as the Yardbirds&#x27; new record producer. Most was not current with new music trends and although Page had worked earlier for Most as a session guitarist, he was reportedly displeased with Most taking on the production duties. According to biographer Gregg Russo, &quot;the upshot of Most&#x27;s involvement was that the Yardbirds&#x27; stage personality ended up becoming vastly different than their recording persona&quot;.

==Recording and production==
The first Mickie Most-involved recordings took place at Olympic Studios in London on 5 March 1967. This session produced the single &quot;Little Games&quot; backed with &quot;Puzzles&quot;. Although Dreja and drummer Jim McCarty were present to record &quot;Little Games&quot;, Most used studio musicians John Paul Jones (bass and cello arrangement) and Dougie Wright (drums) for their parts to cut down on studio time. The remainder of the songs for &quot;Little Games&quot; were recorded during a three-day session at London&#x27;s De Lane Lea Studios from 29 April to 1 May 1967 and session musicians were used, including Jones (bass on &quot;No Excess Baggage&quot;) and Ian Stewart (piano on &quot;Drinking Muddy Water&quot;). One song, an acoustic guitar instrumental titled &quot;White Summer&quot; is a Jimmy Page solo piece. It uses a &quot;DADGAD&quot; guitar tuning, giving it an Eastern music sound, which is enhanced with Indian-percussion tabla played by Chris Karan and an oboe melody line. Another instrumental, &quot;Glimpses&quot;, features guitar parts with Page using a wah-wah pedal and sampled train station and children&#x27;s playground sounds after a voice-manipulated reading of a poem. Page&#x27;s guitar is also prominent on &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor&quot;, where he introduced his guitar-bowing technique; &quot;Drinking Muddy Water&quot;, which uses a slide-guitar part to follow the vocal line (later used to greater effect on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;You Shook Me&quot;); and the instrumental breaks on &quot;Smile on Me&quot;, including a wah-wah guitar coda.

The recording schedule was so hurried that the group often did not even hear the playbacks. Page recalled, &quot;It was just so bloody rushed. Everything was done in one take because Mickie Most was basically interested in singles and didn&#x27;t believe it was worth the time to do the tracks right on the album&quot;. Yardbirds&#x27; chronicler Gregg Russo notes the result was that &quot;many [of the songs] have a demo quality that time shortages would not allow them to change&quot;. In fact one song, the pop-ish &quot;Little Soldier Boy&quot; was issued with McCarty&#x27;s rough vocal guide providing the part intended for a trumpet.

The three subsequent singles recorded by the Yardbirds and later released on the expanded &quot;Little Games Sessions &amp; More&quot; were given a similar treatment. Only singer Keith Relf appears on the cover version of &quot;Ha! Ha! Said the Clown&quot; (with Al Gorgoni on guitar, Rick Nielsen on organ, Joe Macho on bass and Bobby Gregg on drums, recorded at Columbia Studios New York on 13 June 1967 and Abbey Road Studios on 19 June 1967). Two more cover songs, &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (Jones on bass and orchestral arrangement and Clem Cattini on drums, Olympic Studios on 25 September 1967) and &quot;Goodnight Sweet Josephine&quot; (Nicky Hopkins on piano, Jones on bass and Cattini on drums, De Lane Lea in March 1968) also use session musicians. Only the B-side to their last single, the proto-heavy metal &quot;Think About It&quot;, was recorded by the entire group. The song includes a guitar solo that Page had been using in the group&#x27;s concert performances of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (which he carried over, with some different lyrics, to Led Zeppelin).

==Writing and composition==
Unlike the Yardbirds&#x27; three previous charting singles (&quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot; and &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;), &quot;Little Games&quot; was not written by group members. Composed by Harold Spiro and Phil Wainman, its lyrics are echoed in Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;. Another pop song recorded was &quot;No Excess Baggage&quot;, by the Brill Building songwriters Roger Atkins and Carl D&#x27;Errico, who composed the Animals Top 40 hit &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;. Page adapted &quot;White Summer&quot; from Davy Graham&#x27;s version of the Irish folk song &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot;.

The remaining album songs are credited to the band members and include &quot;Drinking Muddy Water&quot;, an interpretation of the blues classic &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;&quot; and nominally a tribute to bluesman Muddy Waters, and &quot;Smile on Me&quot;, a re-working of Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Shake for Me&quot; (which Wolf later re-worked for his &quot;Killing Floor&quot; which Led Zeppelin adapted for &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;). The Yardbirds also recorded &quot;Stealing Stealing&quot;, a jug-band-style song that has been traced back to Gus Cannon&#x27;s Jug Stompers and the Memphis Jug Band.

Russo describes the four and a half minute instrumental collage &quot;Glimpses&quot; as a &quot;brilliant piece of psychedelic imagery [that] revealed the Yardbirds at their most experimental and inspired&quot;. It features multiple-guitar tracks, with effects and bowing, and an electric sitar-backing propelled along by a 6/8 beat and bass riff by McCarty and Dreja. Relf adds several tracks of chanting vocals, reminiscent of the Yardbirds&#x27; 1965 song &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot;. A barely-understandable truncated mechanical-sounding voice recites:
The psychedelic folk-style song &quot;Only the Black Rose&quot; is credited to Relf and features his vocal with acoustic guitar accompaniment by Page and some subdued percussion effects. Described as &quot;reflective&quot; and &quot;emotive&quot; by Russo, it foreshadows the future Relf/McCarty acoustic folk collaborations Together and Renaissance.

As with &quot;Little Games&quot; and unlike their previous hits, the Yardbirds&#x27; subsequent singles were written by others: Tony Hazzard composed &quot;Ha Ha Said the Clown&quot; (a pop hit for Manfred Mann) and the similarly pop-ish &quot;Good Night Sweet Josephine&quot; and Harry Nilsson supplied &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, written in the style of a nursery rhyme.

==Release and critical reception==
&quot;Little Games&quot; was released as a single on 24 March 1967 in the US and 21 April in the UK. It reached number 51 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK. As a result, EMI chose not to issue the album in the UK and it was released only in Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the US. Issued by Epic in the US on 10 or 24 July 1967, &quot;Little Games&quot; made a relatively weak showing in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, peaking at number 80 during a two-month run in the chart.

A &quot;Pop Spotlight&quot; review in the 29 July 1967 &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine was generic, predicting that the album &quot;should reach the charts in short order&quot;, but noted &quot;Drinking Muddy Water&quot; and &quot;Smile On Max &quot;, the album&#x27;s two guitar-heavy blues-rock songs, as &quot;standouts&quot;. To put it into context, the magazine&#x27;s album chart for the week included the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Flowers&quot;, Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; and the self-titled debut albums &quot;The Doors&quot; and &quot;The Grateful Dead&quot;. &quot;The Yardbirds Greatest Hits&quot;, released in March 1967, was also in the chart where it remained into 1968 and placed at number 73 in the 100 best selling albums of 1967.

More recent reviews have generally found fault with &quot;Little Games&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder gave it three out of five stars and wrote &quot;If almost any group other than the Yardbirds had released &quot;Little Games&quot;, it would be considered a flawed but prime late-&#x27;60s psychedelic/hard rock artifact instead of a serious step backward, and even a disappointment&quot;. An AllMusic review by Dave Thompson of the expanded edition &quot;Little Games Sessions &amp; More&quot; began &quot;the day producer Mickie Most moved in on the Yardbirds was the day the Yardbirds&#x27; own values moved out. The union was a lousy idea from the start&quot;. &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; writer also gave the album three out of five stars, calling it &quot;a disastrous attempt at conventional pop&quot;. The Yardbirds themselves were just as critical – Page reportedly regarded &quot;Little Games&quot; as &quot;horrible&quot; and Jim McCarty described Mickie Most as &quot;a protagonist in our downfall&quot;.

The subsequent Most-produced singles were further unsuccessful attempts to reach the pop market. &quot;Little Games&quot; soon went out of print, but after Led Zeppelin rose to stardom and Page became a focus of attention, fans and collectors sought out copies of the album and drove up prices, resulting in counterfeit copies being introduced. The scarcity of the last singles also led to the 1975 bootleg collection &quot;Golden Eggs&quot;, which was widely circulated and successful for its time. However, &quot;Little Games&quot;, along with singles, outtakes, alternate mixes was released by EMI as the two-CD expanded edition &quot;Little Games Sessions &amp; More&quot; in 1992.

Of the last singles and tracks from &quot;Little Games&quot;, the only songs incorporated into the Yardbirds concert repertoire were &quot;Drinking Muddy Water&quot;, the Jimmy Page showcase &quot;White Summer&quot; (later featured in Led Zeppelin concerts in a medley with &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot;), and the psychedelic &quot;Glimpses&quot;, which was soon replaced by &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; as a concert highlight.

==Track listing==
===Original 1967 album===


====Epic album printing errors====
Epic Records, having made several printing errors with Yardbirds material previously, made several more with &quot;Little Games&quot;. Chris Dreja&#x27;s surname for the songwriting credits (previously misspelled as &quot;Drega&quot; on the album &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot;) was again misprinted on the album record labels, as &quot;Ereja&quot;. This error also appears on the Epic &quot;Drinking Muddy Water&quot; single and the tracks &quot;Smile on Me&quot; and &quot;Drinking Muddy Water&quot; included on the 1970 American compilation &quot;The Yardbirds Featuring Performances By Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page&quot;. The US &quot;Little Games&quot; single (written by Harold Spiro and Phil Wainman) only lists the latter writer, misspelled as &quot;Wienman&quot;.

Epic also mistakenly released a number of stereo versions of &quot;Little Games&quot; in mono version sleeves and pressed with mono LP labels. The three-letter prefix of the master numbers on the record labels and in the LP trail-out grooves properly identify the versions. &quot;XEM&quot; indicates genuine mono copies; if it shows &quot;XSB&quot; (even on the labels, despite the mono catalog number and no indication of STEREO under the Epic logo), it is a stereo pressing.

===1992 expanded edition===
The expanded edition of &quot;Little Games&quot;, titled &quot;Little Games Sessions &amp; More&quot;, was released by EMI America as a two-disc set featuring the original album, plus the singles &quot;Ha Ha Said the Clown&quot;, &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Sweet Josephine&quot;. Also included are several outtakes and alternate takes/mixes. A solo acoustic guitar mix of &quot;White Summer&quot; without the percussion and horn is included along with a version of &quot;Glimpses&quot; with different overdubs. The Yardbirds&#x27; final group single recording and one of the strongest with the Page lineup, &quot;Think About It&quot;, also makes its first official album release here. Additionally, three songs recorded by the Keith Relf/Jim McCarty folk-duo Together and a fourth, credited to Relf and McCarty, are also included.

<text>Gaius Terentilius Harsa or Caius Terentilius Arsa was a Tribune of the Plebs of the early Roman Republic in about 462 BC. In 467 BC, Gaius agitated the plebeians to limit the power of consuls.

== Treason ==
Thinking that the absence of the consuls afforded a good opportunity for tribunitian agitation, he spent several days in haranguing the plebeians on the overbearing arrogance of the patricians. In particular, he inveighed against the authority of the consuls as excessive and intolerable in a free commonwealth, for whilst in the name it was less invidious, in reality, it was almost more harsh and oppressive than that of the kings had been, for now, he said, they had two masters instead of one, with uncontrolled, unlimited powers, who, with nothing to curb their licence, directed all the threats and penalties of the laws against the plebeians. To prevent this unfettered tyranny from lasting forever, he said he would propose an enactment that a commission of five should be appointed to draw up in writing the laws which regulated the power of the consuls. Whatever jurisdiction over themselves the people gave the consul, that and that only was he to exercise; he was not to regard his own licence and caprice as law.

When this measure was promulgated, the patricians were apprehensive lest in the absence of the consuls they might have to accept the yoke. A meeting of the senate was convened by Q. Fabius, the prefect of the city. He made such a violent attack upon the proposed law and its author, that the threats and intimidation could not have been greater even if the two consuls had been standing by the tribune, threatening his life. He accused him of plotting treason, of seizing a favourable moment for compassing the ruin of the commonwealth. Terentilius demanded a written constitution to define and limit the powers of the consul. Terentilius claimed that consuls abused their powers and acted with more freedom than kings.

==Life==
Terentilius agitated for a formal code of laws in the early days of the Roman Republic. He took advantage of the fact that the consuls were away on a campaign against the Volsci to pressure the Roman Senate, controlled by patricians, for the code.

The patricians made a show of making peace with Terentilius, but in fact had no intention of codifying the laws at his request. The later Florentine writer Niccolò Machiavelli commented that this was similar to the Florentine &#x27;Ten of War&#x27; that was eventually reinstated once the people realized it was the excessive abuse of authority that was despised, not the title or function of the office itself.

The story of Terentilius comes to us from one source, Book III of Livy&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;.

<doc id="247405" wikidata="Q339517" url="?curid=247405" title="Crossbill">
<text>Crossbills are birds of the genus Loxia within the finch family (Fringillidae), with six species. These birds are characterized by the mandibles with crossed tips, which gives the group its English name. Adult males tend to be red or orange in color, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.

Crossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation which enables them to extract seeds from cones. These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes, where their food sources grow. They irrupt out of the breeding range when the cone crop fails. Crossbills breed very early in the year, often in winter months, to take advantage of maximum cone supplies.

==Systematics and evolution==
The genus &quot;Loxia&quot; was introduced by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The name is from the Ancient Greek , &quot;crosswise&quot;. The Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner had used the word &quot;Loxia&quot; for a crossbill in 1555 in his &quot;Historiae Animalium&quot;. The type species was designated as &quot;Loxia curvirostra&quot; (red crossbill) by George Robert Gray in 1840.

Analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data indicates that the crossbills and redpolls share a common ancestor and only diverged during the Tortonian (, Late Miocene). The research suggests that the genera &quot;Loxia&quot; and &quot;Carduelis&quot; might be merged into a single genus, for which the name &quot;Loxia&quot; would then have priority. But this would imply changing the name of a large number of species, and given that the adaptations of the crossbills represent a unique evolutionary path (see Evolutionary grade), it seems more appropriate to split up the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot; as it had already been done during most of the 20th century. Unfortunately, the fossil record is restricted to a Late Pliocene () species, &quot;Loxia patevi&quot;, found at Varshets, Bulgaria.

The species of crossbills are difficult to separate, and care is needed even with the two-barred and Hispaniolan crossbills, the easiest. The other species are identified by subtle differences in head shape and bill size, and the identification problems formerly led to much taxonomic speculation, with some scientists considering that the parrot and Scottish crossbills and possibly the Hispaniolan and two-barred crossbills are conspecific.

The identification problem is least severe in North America, where only the red and white-winged species occur, and (possibly) worst in the Scottish Highlands, where three species breed and the two-barred is also a possible vagrant.

Work on vocalization in North America suggests that there are eight or nine discrete populations of red crossbill in that continent alone, which do not interbreed and are (like the named species) adapted to specialize in different conifer species. While several ornithologists seem inclined to give these forms species status, no division of the American red crossbills has yet occurred. Preliminary investigations in Europe and Asia suggest an equal, if not greater, complexity, with several different call types identified; these call types being as different from each other as from the named species of the parrot and Scottish crossbills - suggesting either that they &quot;are&quot; valid species, or else that the parrot and Scottish crossbills may &quot;not&quot; be.

Genetic research on their DNA failed to reveal any difference between any of the crossbills (including the morphologically distinct two-barred), with variation between individuals greater than any difference between the taxa. This led to the suggestion that &quot;limited&quot; interbreeding between the different types prevented significant genetic differentiation, and enabled each type to maintain a degree of morphological plasticity, which may be necessary to enable them to feed on different conifers when their preferred food species has a crop failure. Research in Scotland, however, has shown that the parrot and Scottish crossbills are reproductively isolated from each other and also from the red crossbill, despite irruption of that species into their ranges, and the diagnostic calls and bill dimensions have not been lost. They are, therefore, good species.

Currently accepted species and their preferred food sources are:
Originally, the chestnut-backed sparrow-lark (&quot;Eremopterix leucotis&quot;) and Pine grosbeak (&quot;Pinicola enucleator&quot;) were also classified as belonging within the genus &quot;Loxia&quot;.

==Feeding behavior==
The different species specialize in feeding on different conifer species, with the bill shape optimized for opening that species of conifer. This is achieved by inserting the bill between the conifer cone scales and twisting the lower mandible towards the side to which it crosses, enabling the bird to extract the seed at the bottom of the scale with its tongue.

The mechanism by which the bill-crossing is developed (which usually, but not always, occurs in a 1:1 frequency of left-crossing or right-crossing morphs), and what determines the direction, has hitherto withstood all attempts to resolve it.

It is very probable that there is a genetic basis underlying the phenomenon (young birds whose bills are still straight will give a cone-opening behavior if their bills are gently pressed, and the crossing develops before the birds are fledged and feeding independently), but at least in the red crossbill (the only species which has been somewhat thoroughly researched regarding this question) there is no straightforward mechanism of heritability.

While the direction of crossing seems to be the result of at least three genetic factors working together in a case of epistasis and most probably autosomal, it is not clear whether the 1:1 frequency of both morphs in most cases is the result of genetics or environmental selection. Populations that feed on cones without removing or twisting them will likely show a 1:1 morph distribution, no matter what the genetic basis may be: the fitness of each morph is inversely proportional to its frequency in the population. Such birds can only access the cone with the lower mandible tip pointing &quot;towards&quot; it to successfully extract seeds, and thus a too high number of birds of one morph will result in the food availability for each bird of this morph decreasing.

They can utilize other conifers to their preferred, and often need to do so when their preferred species has a crop failure, but are less efficient in their feeding (not enough to prevent survival, but probably enough to reduce breeding success).

==Fossil record== 
&quot;Loxia patevi&quot; was described from the late Pliocene of Varshets, Bulgaria.

<text>Nubians () (Nobiin: &quot;Nobī,&quot; ) are a Nilo-Saharan speaking ethnic group indigenous to the region which is now northern Sudan and southern Egypt. They originate from the early inhabitants of the central Nile valley, believed to be one of the earliest cradles of civilization. In the southern valley of Egypt, Nubians differ culturally and ethnically from Egyptians, although they intermarried with members of other ethnic groups, especially Arabs. They speak Nubian languages as a mother tongue, part of the Northern Eastern Sudanic languages, and Arabic as a second language.

Neolithic settlements have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC, with Wadi Halfa believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley. Parts of Nubia, particularly Lower Nubia, were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of Meroë or the Kingdom of Kush. By the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (744 BC–656 BC), all of Egypt was united with Nubia, extending down to what is now Khartoum. However, in 656 BC the native Twenty-sixth Dynasty regained control of Egypt. As warriors, the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the bow and arrow. In the Middle Ages, the Nubians converted to Christianity and established three kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, Makuria in the center, and Alodia in the south. They then converted to Islam during the Islamization of the Sudan region.

Today, Nubians in Egypt primarily live in southern Egypt, especially in Kom Ombo and Nasr al-Nuba () north of Aswan, and large cities such as Cairo, while Sudanese Nubians live in northern Sudan, particularly in the region between the city of Wadi Halfa on the Egypt–Sudan border and al Dabbah. Some Nubians were forcibly moved to Khashm el Girba and New Halfa upon the construction of the High Dam in Egypt which flooded their ancestral lands. Additionally, a group known as the Midob live in northern Darfur, a group named Birgid in Central Darfur and several groups known as the Hill Nubians who live in Northern Kordofan in Haraza and a few villages in the northern Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state.

The main Nile Nubian groups from north to south are the Kenzi (Kenzi/Mattokki-speaking), Faddicca (Nobiin-speaking), Halfawi (Nobiin-speaking), Sukkot (Nobiin-speaking), Mahas (Nobiin-speaking), and Danagla (Andaandi-speaking).

==Etymology==
Throughout history various parts of Nubia were known by different names, including &quot;Land of the Bow&quot;, &quot;tꜣ nḥsj&quot;, &quot;jꜣm&quot; &quot;Kerma&quot;, &quot;jrṯt&quot;, &quot;sṯjw&quot;, &quot;wꜣwꜣt&quot;, Meroitic: &quot;akin(e)&quot; &quot;Lower &quot;Nubia&quot;, and Greek &quot;Aethiopia&quot;. The origin of the names &quot;Nubia&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot; are contested. Based on cultural traits, some scholars believe Nubia is derived from the &quot;gold&quot;, although there is no such usage of the term as an ethnonym or toponym that can be found in known Egyptian texts; the Egyptians referred to people from this area as the &quot;nḥsj.w&quot;. The Roman Empire used the term &quot;Nubia&quot; to describe the area of Upper Egypt and northern Sudan

==History==


The prehistory of Nubia dates to the Paleolithic around 300,000 years ago. By about 6000 BC, peoples in the region had developed an agricultural economy. In their history, they adopted the Egyptian hieroglyphic system. Ancient history in Nubia is categorized according to the following periods: A-Group culture (3700–2800 BC), C-Group culture (2300–1600 BC), Kerma culture (2500–1500 BC), Nubian contemporaries of the New Kingdom (1550–1069 BC), the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (1000–653 BC), Napata (1000–275 BC), Meroë (275 BC–300/350 AD), Makuria (340–1317 AD), Nobatia (350–650 AD), and Alodia (600s–1504 AD).

Archaeological evidence has attested that population settlements occurred in Nubia as early as the Late Pleistocene era and from the 5th millennium BC onwards, whereas there is &quot;no or scanty evidence&quot; of human presence in the Egyptian Nile Valley during these periods, which may be due to problems in site preservation.

Several scholars have argued that the African origins of the Egyptian civilisation derived from pastoral communities which emerged in both the Egyptian and Sudanese regions of the Nile Valley in the fifth millennium BCE.

Various biological anthropological studies have shown close, biological affinities between the predynastic southern, Egyptian and the early Nubian populations.

Frank Yurco (1996) remarked that depictions of pharonic iconography such as the royal crowns, Horus falcons and victory scenes were concentrated in the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture and A-Group Lower Nubia. He further elaborated that &quot;Egyptian writing arose in Naqadan Upper Egypt and A-Group Lower Nubia, and not in the Delta cultures, where the direct Western Asian contact was made, [which] further vitiates the Mesopotamian-influence argument&quot;.

In 2023, Christopher Ehret reported that the existing archaeological, linguistic, biological anthropological and genetic evidence had determined the founding populations of Ancient Egyptian areas such as Naqada and El-Badari to be the descendants of longtime inhabitants in Northeastern Africa which included Egypt, Nubia and the northern Horn of Africa.

The linguistic affinities of early Nubian cultures are uncertain. Some research has suggested that the early inhabitants of the Nubia region, during the C-Group and Kerma cultures, were speakers of languages belonging to the Berber and Cushitic branches, respectively, of the Afroasiatic family. More recent research instead suggests that the people of the Kerma culture spoke Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudanic branch and that the peoples of the C-Group culture to their north spoke Cushitic languages. They were succeeded by the first Nubian language speakers, whose tongues belonged to another branch of Eastern Sudanic languages within the Nilo-Saharan phylum. A 4th-century AD victory stela commemorative of Axumite king Ezana contains inscriptions describing two distinct population groups dwelling in ancient Nubia: a &quot;red&quot; population and a &quot;black&quot; population.

Although Egypt and Nubia have a shared pre-dynastic and pharaonic history, the two histories diverge with the fall of Ancient Egypt and the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. At this point, the area of land between the 1st and the 6th cataract of the Nile became known as Nubia.

Egypt was conquered first by the Persians and named the Satrapy (Province) of Mudriya, and two centuries later by the Greeks and then the Romans. During the latter period, however, the Kushites formed the kingdom of Meroë, which was ruled by a series of legendary Candaces or Queens. Mythically, the Candace of Meroë was able to intimidate Alexander the Great into retreat with a great army of elephants, while historical documents suggest that the Nubians defeated the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar, resulting in a favorable peace treaty for Meroë. The kingdom of Meroë also defeated the Persians, and later Christian Nubia defeated the invading Arab armies on three different occasions resulting in the 600 year peace treaty of &quot;Baqt&quot;, the longest lasting treaty in history. The fall of the kingdom of Christian Nubia occurred in the early 1500s resulting in full Islamization and reunification with Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, the Muhammad Ali dynasty, and British colonial rule. After the 1956 independence of Sudan from Egypt, Nubia and the Nubian people became divided between Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan.
Modern Nubians speak Nubian languages, Eastern Sudanic languages that is part of the Nilo-Saharan family. The Old Nubian language is attested from the 8th century AD, and is the oldest recorded language of Africa outside of the Afroasiatic family.

Nubia consisted of four regions with varied agriculture and landscapes. The Nile river and its valley were found in the north and central parts of Nubia, allowing farming using irrigation. The western Sudan had a mixture of peasant agriculture and nomadism. Eastern Sudan had primarily nomadism, with a few areas of irrigation and agriculture. Finally, there was the fertile pastoral region of the south, where Nubia&#x27;s larger agricultural communities were located.

Nubia was dominated by kings from clans that controlled the gold mines. Trade in exotic goods from other parts of Africa (ivory, animal skins) passed to Egypt through Nubia.

==Language==
Modern Nubians speak Nubian languages. They belong to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan phylum. But there is some uncertainty regarding the classification of the languages spoken in Nubia in antiquity. There is some evidence that Cushitic languages were spoken in parts of Lower (northern) Nubia, an ancient region which straddles present-day Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan, and that Eastern Sudanic languages were spoken in Upper and Central Nubia, before the spread of Eastern Sudanic languages even further north into Lower Nubia.

Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechhaus-Gerst (2000) suggest that the ancient peoples of the C-Group and Kerma civilizations spoke Afroasiatic languages of the Berber and Cushitic branches, respectively. They propose that the Nilo-Saharan Nobiin language today contains a number of key pastoralism related loanwords that are of Berber or proto-Highland East Cushitic origin, including the terms for sheep/goatskin, hen/cock, livestock enclosure, butter and milk. This in turn, is interpreted to suggest that the C-Group and Kerma populations, who inhabited the Nile Valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers, spoke Afroasiatic languages.

Claude Rilly (2010, 2016) and Julien Cooper (2017) on the other hand, suggest that the Kerma peoples (of Upper Nubia) spoke Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudanic branch, possibly ancestral to the later Meroitic language, which Rilly also suggests was Nilo-Saharan. Rilly also considers evidence of significant early Afro-Asiatic influence, especially Berber, on Nobiin to be weak (and where present, more likely due to borrowed loanwords than substrata), and considers evidence of substratal influence on Nobiin from an earlier now extinct Eastern Sudanic language to be stronger.
Julien Cooper (2017) suggests that Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudan branch were spoken by the people of Kerma, those further south along the Nile, to the west, and those of Saï (an island to the north of Kerma), but that Afro-Asiatic (most likely Cushitic) languages were spoken by other peoples in Lower Nubia (such as the Medjay and the C-Group culture) living in Nubian regions north of Saï toward Egypt and those southeast of the Nile in Punt in the Eastern dessert. Based partly on an analysis of the phonology of place names and personal names from the relevant regions preserved in ancient texts, he argues that the terms from &quot;Kush&quot; and &quot;Irem&quot; (ancient names for Kerma and the region south of it respectively) in Egyptian texts display traits typical of Eastern Sudanic languages, while those from further north (in Lower Nubia) and east are more typical of the Afro-Asiatic family, noting: &quot;The Irem-list also provides a similar inventory to Kush, placing this firmly in an Eastern Sudanic zone. These Irem/Kush-lists are distinctive from the Wawat-, Medjay-, Punt-, and Wetenet-lists, which provide sounds typical to Afroasiatic languages.&quot;

It is also uncertain to which language family the ancient Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, belongs to the Afroasiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which, she argues, are similar to those of the Afroasiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages. Claude Rilly proposes, based on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary, that Meroitic, like the Nobiin language, belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family.

==Nubian Greeks==

===Axumite subjugation of Nubia===

The Axumite Empire of Ethiopia engaged in a series of invasions that culminated in the capture of the Nubian capital of Meroë in the middle of the 4th century AD, signaling the end of independent Nubian Pagan kingdoms. The Axumites then sent missionaries to the Nubia to establish similar Syrian-based Christianity like in Ethiopia, but were competing with Egyptian-based Christianity, who eventually established the authority of the Coptic Church in the area, and founded new Nubian Christian kingdoms, such as Nobatia, Alodia, and Makuria.

Tribal nomads like the Beja, Afar, and Saho managed to remain autonomous due to their uncentralized nomadic nature. These tribal peoples would sporadically inflict attacks and raids on Axumite communities. The Beja nomads eventually Hellenized and integrated into the Nubian Greek society that had already been present in Lower Nubia for three centuries.

===Nubian Greek society===

Nubian Greek culture followed the pattern of Egyptian Greek and Byzantine Greek civilization, expressed in Nubian Greek art and Nubian Greek literature. The earliest attestations of Nubian Greek literature come from the 5th century; the Nubian Greek language resembles Egyptian and Byzantine Greek; it served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; throughout the Nubian Kingdoms, and had a creolized form for trade among the different peoples in Nubia.

Nubian Greek was unique in that it adopted many words from both Coptic Egyptian and Nubian; Nubian Greek&#x27;s syntax also evolved to establish a fixed word order.

The following is an example of Nubian Greek language: 
 
A plethora of frescoes created between 800–1200AD in Nubian cities such as Faras depicted religious life in the courts of the Nubian Kingdoms; they were made in Byzantine art style.

Nubian Greek titles and government styles in Nubian Kingdoms were based on Byzantine models; even with Islamic encroachments and influence into Nubian territory, the Nubian Greeks saw Constantinople as their spiritual home. Nubian Greek culture disappeared after the Muslim conquest of Nubia around 1450AD.

==Modern Nubians==
The descendants of the ancient Nubians still inhabit the general area of what was ancient Nubia. They currently live in what is called Old Nubia, mainly located in modern Egypt and Sudan. Nubians have been resettled in large numbers (an estimated 50,000 people) away from Wadi Halfa North Sudan in to Khashm el Girba – Sudan and some moved to Southern Egypt since the 1960s, when the Aswan High Dam was built on the Nile, flooding ancestral lands. Most Nubians nowadays work in Egyptian and Sudanese cities. Whereas Arabic was once only learned by Nubian men who travelled for work, it is increasingly being learned by Nubian women who have access to school, radio and television. Nubian women are working outside the home in increasing numbers.

During the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Egypt employed Nubian people as Code talkers.

==Culture==
Nubians have developed a common identity, which has been celebrated in poetry, novels, music, and storytelling.

Nubians in modern Sudan include the Danagla around Dongola Reach, the Mahas from the Third Cataract to Wadi Halfa, and the Sikurta around Aswan. These Nubians write using their own script. They also practice scarification: Mahas men and women have three scars on each cheek, while the Danaqla wear these scars on their temples. Younger generations appear to be abandoning this custom.

Nubia&#x27;s ancient cultural development was influenced by its geography. It is sometimes divided into Upper Nubia and Lower Nubia. Upper Nubia was where the ancient Kingdom of Napata (the Kush) was located. Lower Nubia has been called &quot;the corridor to Africa&quot;, where there was contact and cultural exchange between Nubians, Egyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, and Arabs. Lower Nubia was also where the Kingdom of Meroe flourished. The languages spoken by modern Nubians are based on ancient Sudanic dialects. From north to south, they are: Kenuz, Fadicha (Matoki), Sukkot, Mahas, Danagla.

Kerma, Nepata, and Meroe were Nubia&#x27;s largest population centres. The rich agricultural lands of Nubia supported these cities. Ancient Egyptian rulers sought control of Nubia&#x27;s wealth, including gold, and the important trade routes within its territories. Nubia&#x27;s trade links with Egypt led to Egypt&#x27;s domination over Nubia during the New Kingdom period. The emergence of the Kingdom of Meroe in the 8th century BC led to Egypt being under the control of Nubian rulers for a century, although they preserved many Egyptian cultural traditions. Nubian kings were considered pious scholars and patrons of the arts, copying ancient Egyptian texts and even restoring some Egyptian cultural practices. After this, Egypt&#x27;s influence declined greatly. Meroe became the centre of power for Nubia and cultural links with other parts of Africa gained greater influence.

===Religion===
Today, Nubians practice Islam. To a certain degree, Nubian religious practices involve a syncretism of Islam and traditional folk beliefs. In ancient times, Nubians practiced a mixture of traditional religion and Egyptian religion. Prior to the spread of Islam, many Nubians practiced Christianity.

Beginning in the eighth century, Islam arrived in Nubia. Though Christians and Muslims (primarily Arab merchants at this period) may have lived peacefully together, Arab armies often invaded Christian Nubian kingdoms. An example of this being Makuria, where in 651 an Arab army invaded, but was repulsed, and a treaty known as the &quot;Baqt&quot; was signed, preventing further Arab invasions in exchange for 360 slaves each year. Notably, the Baqt required Nubians to maintain a mosque for Muslim visitors and residents. This, and with the following Ottoman occupation of Lower Nubia in the 1560s, led to the kingdom and Christian Nubian society to disappear. The former Makurian territories south of the 3rd cataract, including the former capital Dongola, had been annexed by the Islamic Funj Sultanate by the early 16th century. Over time, the Nubians gradually converted to Islam, beginning with the Nubian elite. Islam was mainly spread via Sufi preachers that settled in Nubia in the late 14th century onwards. By the sixteenth century, most of the Nubians were Muslim.

Ancient Nepata was an important religious centre in Nubia. It was the location of Gebel Barkal, a massive sandstone hill resembling a rearing cobra in the eyes of the ancient inhabitants. Egyptian priests declared it to be the home of the ancient deity Amun, further enhancing Nepata as an ancient religious site. This was the case for both Egyptians and Nubians. Egyptian and Nubian deities alike were worshipped in Nubia for 2,500 years, even while Nubia was under the control of the New Kingdom of Egypt. Nubian kings and queens were buried near Gebel Barkal, in pyramids as the Egyptian pharaohs were. Nubian pyramids were built at Gebel Barkal, at Nuri (across the Nile from Gebel Barkal), at El Kerru, and at Meroe, south of Gebel Barkal.

==Architecture==

Modern Nubian architecture in Sudan is distinctive, and typically features a large courtyard surrounded by a high wall. A large, ornately decorated gate, preferably facing the Nile, dominates the property. Brightly colored stucco is often decorated with symbols connected with the family inside, or popular motifs such as geometric patterns, palm trees, or the evil eye that wards away bad luck.

Nubians invented the Nubian vault, a type of curved surface forming a vaulted structure.

==Genetics==
Autosomal DNA has been extensively studied in recent years, and some of the findings are as follows:
* Babiker, H. M., Schlebusch, C. M., Hassan, H. Y., et al. (2011) revealed that individuals from northern Sudan clustered with those from Egypt, while individuals from South Sudan clustered with those from Karamoja (Uganda). They conclude that &quot;the similarity of the Nubian and Egyptian populations suggest that migration, potentially bidirectional, occurred along the Nile river Valley, which is consistent with the historical evidence for long-term interactions between Egypt and Nubia.
* Dobon et al. (2015) identified an ancestral autosomal component of West Eurasian origin that is common to many Sudanese Arabs, Nubians and Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the region. Nubians were found to be genetically modelled similar to their Cushitic and Semitic (Afro-Asiatic) neighbors (such as the Beja, Sudanese Arabs, and Ethiopians) rather than to other Nilo-Saharan speakers who lack this Middle Eastern/North African influence. The study showed that these populations formed a &quot;North-East cluster&quot;, which included Northern Sudanese. This may be explained by the aforementioned groups being a mixture of a population similar to Modern Coptic Egyptians, and an ancestral Southern African one.
* Sirak et al. (2015) analysed the DNA of a Christian-period inhabitant of Kulubnarti in northern Nubia near the Egyptian border. They found that this individual was most closely related to Middle Eastern populations. Further excavations of two Early Christian period (AD 550–800) cemeteries at Kulubnarti, one located on the mainland and the other on an island, revealed the existence of two ancestrally and socioeconomically distinct local populations. Preliminary results, including mitochondrial haplogroup analysis, suggests there may be substantial differences in the genetic composition between the two communities, with 70% of individuals from the island cemetery demonstrating African-based haplogroups (L2, L1, and L5), compared to only 36.4% of mainlanders, who instead show an increased prevalence of European and Near Eastern haplogroups (including K1, H, I5, and U1).

* Hollfelder et al. (2017) analysed various populations in Sudan and observed close autosomal affinities between their Nubian and Sudanese Arab samples. The authors concluded that the &quot;Nubians can be seen as a group with substantial genetic material relating to Nilotes that later received much gene-flow from Eurasians and East Africans. The strongest admixture came from Eurasian populations and was likely quite extensive: 39.41%–47.73%.&quot; The study also showed &quot;almost no West African component or, at a higher K, Bantu component&quot;.
* In 2018, Carina M. Schlebusch and Mattias Jakobsson in the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics, found that Nilotic populations from South Sudan (e.g. Dinka, Nuer and Shilluk) remained isolated and received little to no geneflow from Eurasians, West African Bantu-speaking farmers, and other surrounding groups. In contrast, Nubians and Arabs in the north showed admixture from Western Eurasian populations. The population structure analysis and inferred ancestry showed that &quot;the Nubian, Arab, and Beja populations of northeastern Africa roughly display equal admixture fractions from a local northeastern African gene pool (similar to the Nilotic component) and an incoming Eurasian migrant component.&quot;
* Bird, Nancy et al. (2023) discovered that, in contrast to other African groups which saw strong correlation between genetics, ethnicity and geography, the genetic patterns of variation among Sudanese Arabs, Nubians, and Beja, showed no correspondence with ethnicity. All these communities had individuals who fell into two main clusters: &quot;Sudan Nile 1&quot; and &quot;Sudan Nile 2&quot;, with the first showing a maximum of 12% inferred Arabian-related ancestry, and the second upwards of 48%. The main difference between the pooled clusters was the proportion of the component related to Saudi Arabia, with less of such ancestry more commonly seen in the Nubians and Beja on average.

===Y-DNA===
2008 results of an analysis by Hisham Y. Hassan of modern Sudanese entitled &quot;Chromosome Variation Among Sudanese: Restricted Gene Flow, Concordance With Language, Geography, and History&quot; included 39 Nubians found to be of the following Y Chromosome Haplogroups:

* J1 41%
* J2 2%
* E3b1 (E-M78) 15.3%
* E3 (E-M215) 7.6%
* R1b 10.3%
* B-M60 7.7%
* F 10.2%
* I 5.1%

===Christian-Era DNA===
Sirak et al. 2021 obtained and analyzed the whole genomes of 66 individuals from the site of Kulubnarti situated between the 2nd and 3rd cataract and dated to the Christian period between 650 and 1000 CE. The samples were obtained from two cemeteries, R and S. Grave materials between the two cemeteries did not differ, but physical analyses of the remains found differences in morbidity and mortality indicating that the R cemetery individuals were of a higher social class than the cemetery S individuals. The study analyzed the data they obtained along with other published ancient and modern samples from Africa and West Eurasia. The genetic profile of the sampled Christian-era Nubians was found to be a mixture between West Eurasian and Sub Saharan Dinka-related ancestries. The samples were estimated to have approximately 60% West Eurasian related ancestry that likely came from ancient Egyptians but ultimately resembles that found in Bronze or Iron Age Levantines. They also carried approximately 40% Dinka-related ancestry. The study commented that the results reflect deep biological connections among the populations of the Nile Valley and further confirm the presence of West Eurasian ancestry in the Nile valley prior to Arab migrations.

The two cemeteries showed minimal differences in their West Eurasian/Dinka ancestry proportions, formed a genetic clade with each other in relation to other populations, and had a small FST value of 0.0013 reflecting a small genetic distance. These findings in addition to multiple cross cemetery relatives that the analyses have revealed indicate that people of both the R and S cemeteries were part of the same population despite the archaeological and anthropological differences between the two burials showing social stratification.

The study found some difference in Y haplogroups profiles between the two cemeteries with the S cemetery having more west Asian clades. the difference was found to be insignificant, and the study viewed it as likely to be a statistical fluctuation and not evidence of heterogeneity among males from the two cemeteries.

Regarding modern Nubians, despite their superficial resemblance to the Kulubnarti Nubians on the PCA, they were not found to be descended from Kulubnarti Nubians without additional later admixtures. modern Nubians were found to have an increase in Sub-Saharan ancestry along with a change in their west Eurasian ancestry from that found in the ancient samples.

<doc id="247409" wikidata="Q4469383" url="?curid=247409" title="Lien">
<text>A lien ( or ) is a form of security interest granted over an item of property to secure the payment of a debt or performance of some other obligation. The owner of the property, who grants the lien, is referred to as the &quot;lienee&quot; and the person who has the benefit of the lien is referred to as the &quot;lienor&quot; or &quot;lien holder&quot;.

The etymological root is Anglo-French &quot;lien&quot; or &quot;loyen&quot;, meaning &quot;bond&quot;, &quot;restraint&quot;, from the Latin &quot;ligamen&quot;, from &quot;ligare&quot; &quot;to bind&quot;.

In the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of encumbrances and would include other forms of mortgage or charge. In the US, a lien characteristically refers to &quot;nonpossessory&quot; security interests (see generally: ).

In other common-law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest, being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the US, in other countries it refers to a purely &quot;possessory&quot; form of security interest; indeed, when possession of the property is lost, the lien is released. However, common-law countries also recognize a slightly anomalous form of security interest called an &quot;equitable lien&quot;, which arises in certain rare instances.

Despite their differences in terminology and application, there are some similarities between liens in the US and elsewhere in the common-law world.

==United States==
Liens can be &quot;consensual&quot; or &quot;nonconsensual&quot; (&quot;voluntary&quot; or &quot;involuntary&quot; in different states). Consensual liens are imposed by a contract between the creditor and the debtor:

*Mortgage
*Chattel mortgage

Nonconsensual liens typically arise by statute or by the operation of the common law. Those laws give a creditor the right to impose a lien on an item of real property or a chattel by the existence of the relationship of creditor and debtor. Those liens include:

*tax liens, imposed to secure payment of a tax;
*&quot;weed liens&quot; and &quot;demolition liens&quot;, assessed by the government to rectify a property from being a nuisance and public hazard;
*homeowner association (HOA) liens for unpaid assessments, fines, late charges, interest, costs, and attorney fees;
*attorney&#x27;s liens, against funds and documents to secure payment of fees;
*mechanic&#x27;s liens, which secure payment for work done on real property or land;
*judgment liens, imposed to secure payment of a judgment; and
*maritime liens, imposed on ships by admiralty law.

Liens are also &quot;perfected&quot; or &quot;unperfected&quot; (see Perfection (law)). Perfected liens are those for which a creditor has established a priority right in the encumbered property concerning third-party creditors. Perfection is generally accomplished by taking steps required by law to notify third-party creditors of the lien. The fact that an item of property is in the hands of the creditor usually constitutes perfection. Where the property remains in the hands of the debtor, a further step must be taken, like recording a notice of the security interest with the appropriate office.

Perfecting a lien is essential in protecting the secured creditor&#x27;s interest in the property. A perfected lien is valid against bona fide purchasers of property and even against a trustee in bankruptcy; an unperfected lien may not be.

===Equitable lien (U.S.)===
In the United States, references to an &quot;equitable lien&quot; is a right, enforceable only in equity, to have a demand satisfied out of a particular fund or specific property without having possession of the fund or property. An equitable lien is a legal remedy rather than a security interest created to contemplate or support a transaction. In US law, such liens characteristically arise in four circumstances:
# when an occupant of land, believing in good faith to be the owner of the land, makes improvements, repairs, or other expenditure that permanently increases the land&#x27;s value;
# when one of two or more joint owners makes expenditures of the kind described above;
# when a tenant for life completes permanent and beneficial improvements to the estate begun earlier by the testator; and
# when land or other property is transferred subject to the payment of debts, legacies, portions, or annuities to third persons.

===Mover&#x27;s lien===
Movers are typically entitled to a mover&#x27;s lien under UCC § 7-307/308 to withhold a customer&#x27;s goods to secure payment. This is a possessory lien and is the nonconsensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon). However, the concept of a mover&#x27;s lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate. Because the customer is interested in obtaining their goods, they are under duress to pay the ransom. Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under 49 USC 13905. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and delicensing offending moving companies. Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

Disputes between legitimate lienholding of chattels versus hostage-loading can sometimes be averted by the customer, including an advanced (before-the-fact) consensual waiver of the mover&#x27;s right to a lien in the written contract, obligating the moving company to deliver the goods with reasonable dispatch regardless of payment disputes. Failure to do so would constitute conversion or trespass to chattels.

==Other common-law countries==
Outside the US, a common-law lien may be defined as a passive right to retain a chattel (and, sometimes, documentary intangibles and papers) conferred by law. Modern law has generally left the legal lien to cases where it has been historically established without any real effort to make it applicable to current conditions. In &quot;Tappenden v Artus&quot; [1964] 2 QB 185, Diplock LJ referred to a lien as a &quot;self-help&quot; remedy, like &quot;other primitive remedies such as abatement of a nuisance, self-defence or ejection of trespassers to land&quot;. Equitable liens are an unusual species of property right, usually considered &quot;sui generis&quot;.

===Common-law lien===
Common-law liens are divided into &quot;special liens&quot; and &quot;general liens&quot;. A special lien, the more common kind, requires a close connection between the property and the service rendered. A special lien can only be exercised regarding fees relating to the instant transaction; the lienor cannot use the property held as security for past debts. A general lien affects all of the property of the lienee in the possession of the lienor and stands as security for all of the debts of the lienee to the lienor. A special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract, which is commonly done in the case of carriers. A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law, although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale, and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract.

The common-law liens are closely aligned to the so-called &quot;common callings&quot; but are not co-extensive with them.

A common-law lien is a very limited type of security interest. Apart from the fact that it only amounts to a passive right to retain, a lien cannot be transferred; it cannot be asserted by a third party to whom possession of the goods is given to perform the same services that the original party should have performed; and if the chattel is surrendered to the lienor, the lien entitlement is lost forever (except for where the parties agree that the lien shall survive a temporary re-possession by the lienor). A lienee who sells the chattel unlawfully may be liable for conversion and surrendering the lien.

===Equitable lien===
In common-law countries, equitable liens give rise to unique and complex issues. An equitable lien is a nonpossessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an equitable charge. It differs from a charge in that it is nonconsensual. It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) concerning the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property. It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule, which confers a beneficial interest in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase.

It is a matter of conjecture how far equitable liens extend outside the unpaid vendor&#x27;s lien. Equitable liens have been held to exist in several cases involving choses in action, but not yet concerning chattels. The Australian courts have been the most receptive towards equitable liens concerning personal property (see &quot;Hewett v Court&quot; (1983) 57 ALJR 211), but a review of the cases still leaves a lack of clarity concerning the principles upon which an equitable lien will be imposed.
* In &quot;Re Stucley&quot; [1906] 1 Ch 67, a vendor of a reversionary interest in a trust fund sold the interest to the trustee and was held to have an equitable lien in the subject matter. However, it was personalty and not realty.
* In &quot;Barker v Cox&quot; (1876) 4 Ch D 464, the purchaser of property that was included in a marital settlement paid the price in advance to one of the trustees, and the purchaser was held to have an equitable lien in investments which the trustees subsequently acquired with the purchase price.
* In &quot;Langen and Wing v Bell&quot; [1972] Ch 685, a director&#x27;s service agreement required him to assign his shares in the company if he was terminated, and he was to receive a price calculated at a later date when the annual accounts were available; he was held to have an equitable lien over the transferred shares to secure the payment of the eventual purchase price.
* In &quot;Lord Napier and Ettrick v Hunter&quot; [1993] 2 WLR 42, it was held that an indemnity insurer&#x27;s subrogation rights concerning funds improperly paid directly to the insured were subject to an equitable lien.

But overall, there is still a lack of central nexus.

===Statutory liens and contractual liens===
Although arguably not liens as such, two other forms of encumbrance are sometimes referred to as liens.

====Statutory liens====
Certain statutes provide a passive right to retain property against its owner as security for obligations. For example, section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 of the United Kingdom permits an airport to detain aircraft for unpaid airport charges and aviation fuel. Although this right has been treated as a lien under UK insolvency law, it has been argued that such statutory rights are not in fact liens, but rights analogous to liens, although an argument may be made that this is a distinction without a difference.

====Contractual liens====
It has also been argued that an agreement by contract that one party may retain the goods of another party until paid is not a lien, as under the common law, liens could only be nonconsensual. However, under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as liens even if they are not expressed as liens.

==Maritime liens==

A maritime lien is a lien on a vessel given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services or suffered an injury from the vessel&#x27;s use. Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as &quot;tacit hypothecation&quot;. Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.

The maritime lien has been described as &quot;one of the most striking peculiarities of Admiralty law&quot;. A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity. It arises purely by operation of law. It is a claim upon the property, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest. Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as:
# a privileged claim,
# upon maritime property,
# for service to it or damage done by it,
# accruing from the moment that the claim attaches,
# travelling with the property unconditionally,
# enforced by an action &quot;in rem&quot;.

==Nomenclature==

<text>Cynodontia () is a clade of eutheriodont therapsids that first appeared in the Late Permian (approximately 260 mya), and extensively diversified after the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Mammals are cynodonts, as are their extinct ancestors and close relatives (Mammaliaformes), having evolved from advanced probainognathian cynodonts during the Late Triassic.

Non-mammalian cynodonts occupied a variety of ecological niches, both as carnivores and as herbivores. Following the emergence of mammals, most other cynodont lines went extinct, with the last known non-mammaliaform cynodont group, the Tritylodontidae, having its youngest records in the Early Cretaceous.

== Description ==

Early cynodonts have many of the skeletal characteristics of mammals. The teeth were fully differentiated and the braincase bulged at the back of the head. Outside of some crown-group mammals (notably the therians), all cynodonts probably laid eggs. The temporal fenestrae were much larger than those of their ancestors, and the widening of the zygomatic arch in a more mammal-like skull would have allowed for more robust jaw musculature. They also have the secondary palate that other primitive therapsids lacked, except the therocephalians, who were the closest relatives of cynodonts. (However, the secondary palate of cynodonts primarily comprises the maxillae and palatines as in mammals, whereas the secondary palate of the therocephalians primarily comprises the maxillae and the vomer.) The dentary was the largest bone in their lower jaw.

The cynodonts probably had some form of warm-blooded metabolism. This has led to many reconstructions of cynodonts as having fur. Being endothermic they may have needed it for thermoregulation, but fossil evidence of their fur (or lack thereof) has been elusive. Modern mammals have Harderian glands secreting lipids to coat their fur, but the telltale imprint of this structure is only found from the primitive mammal &quot;Morganucodon&quot; and onwards. Nonetheless, recent studies on Permian synapsid coprolites show that more basal therapsids may have had fur, and at any rate fur was already present in Mammaliaformes such as &quot;Castorocauda&quot; and &quot;Megaconus&quot;.

Early cynodonts had numerous small foramina on their snout bones, similar to reptiles. This suggests that they had immobile, non-muscular lips like those of lizards, and lacked muscular cheeks. As a muscular, mobile face is necessary to perform whisking movements and to avoid damage to whiskers, it is unlikely that early cynodonts had whiskers. In prozostrodontian cynodonts, the group that includes mammals, the foramina are replaced by a single large infraorbital foramen, which indicates that the face had become muscular and that whiskers would have been present.

Derived cynodonts developed epipubic bones. These served to strengthen the torso and support abdominal and hindlimb musculature, aiding them in the development of an erect gait, but at the expense of prolonged pregnancy, forcing these animals to give birth to highly altricial young as in modern marsupials and monotremes. Only placentals, and perhaps &quot;Megazostrodon&quot; and &quot;Erythrotherium&quot;, would lose these. A specimen of &quot;Kayentatherium&quot; does indeed demonstrate that at least tritylodontids already had a fundamentally marsupial-like reproductive style, but produced much higher litters at around 38 perinates or possibly eggs.

Cynodonts are the only known synapsid lineage to have produced aerial locomotors, with gliding being known in haramiyidans and various mammal groups, and placental mammals having developed flight.

The largest known non-mammalian cynodont is &quot;Scalenodontoides&quot;, a traversodontid, which has been estimated to have a maximum skull length of approximately based on a fragmentary specimen.

==Evolutionary history==
The closest relatives of cynodonts are therocephalians, with which they form the clade Eutheriodontia.

The earliest cynodonts are known early Lopingian (early Wuchiapingian) aged sediments of the &quot;Tropidostoma&quot; Assemblage Zone, in the Karoo Supergroup of South Africa, belonging to the basal family Charassognathidae. Fossils of Permian cynodonts are relatively rare outside of South Africa, with the most widely distributed genus being &quot;Procynosuchus,&quot; which is known from South Africa, Germany, Tanzania, Zambia, and possibly Russia.

Cynodonts expanded rapidly in diversity after the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Peak disparity in cynodonts occurred from the Induan to the Carnian and in the middle Norian. Post-Early Triassic cynodonts were dominated by members of the advanced clade Eucynodontia, which has two main subdivisions, the predominantly herbivorous Cynognathia and the predominantly carnivorous Probainognathia. During the Early and Middle Triassic, cynodont diversity was dominated by members of Cynognathia, and members of Probainognathia would not become prominent until the Late Triassic (early Norian). Almost all Middle Triassic cynodonts are known from Gondwana, with only one genus (&quot;Nanogomphodon&quot;) having been found in the Northern Hemisphere. Among the most dominant groups of Middle and Late Triassic cynodonts is the herbivorous Traversodontidae, predominantly in Gondwana, which reached a peak diversity in the Late Triassic. Mammaliaformes originated from probainognathian cynodonts during the Late Triassic. Early Mammaliaformes were small bodied insectivores. Only two groups of non-mammaliaform cynodonts existed beyond the end of the Triassic, both belonging to Probainognathia. The first is the insectivorous Tritheledontidae, which briefly lasted into the Early Jurassic. The second is the herbivorous Tritylodontidae, which first appeared in the latest Triassic, which were abundant and diverse during the Jurassic, predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere, persisted into the Early Cretaceous (Barremian-Aptian) in Asia, at least until around 120 million years ago, as represented by &quot;Fossiomanus&quot; from China.

During their evolution, the number of cynodont jaw bones reduced. This move towards a single bone for the mandible paved the way for other bones in the jaw, the articular and angular, to migrate to the cranium, where they function as parts of the mammalian hearing system.

Cynodonts also developed a secondary palate in the roof of the mouth. This caused air flow from the nostrils to travel to a position in the back of the mouth instead of directly through it, allowing cynodonts to chew and breathe at the same time. This characteristic is present in all mammals.

==Taxonomy==
Richard Owen named Cynodontia in 1861, which he assigned to Anomodontia as a family. Robert Broom (1913) reranked Cynodontia as an infraorder, since retained by others, including Colbert and Kitching (1977), Carroll (1988), Gauthier &quot;et al.&quot; (1989), and Rubidge and Cristian Sidor (2001). Olson (1966) assigned Cynodontia to Theriodontia, Colbert and Kitching (1977) to Theriodontia, and Rubridge and Sidor (2001) to Eutheriodontia. William King Gregory (1910), Broom (1913), Carroll (1988), Gauthier &quot;et al.&quot; (1989), Hopson and Kitching (2001) and Botha &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) all considered Cynodontia as belonging to Therapsida. Botha &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) seems to have followed Owen (1861), but without specifying taxonomic rank.

<text>Eucynodontia (&quot;true dog teeth&quot;) is a clade of cynodont therapsids including mammals and most non-mammalian cynodonts. The oldest eucynodonts are known from the Early Triassic and possibly Late Permian. Eucynodontia includes two major subgroups, Cynognathia and Probainognathia.

The clade was named in 1982 by Thomas Kemp, who defined it as all cynodonts more derived than &quot;Thrinaxodon&quot;.

In 2001, Hopson and Kitching redefined the clade Eucynodontia as the least inclusive group containing Mammalia and &quot;Exaeretodon&quot;.

<doc id="247413" wikidata="Q656603" url="?curid=247413" title="Jičín">
<text>Jičín (; or &quot;Gitschin&quot;) is a town in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 16,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

The town&#x27;s history is connected with Albrecht von Wallenstein who had rebuilt the town, and many sights bear his name.

==Administrative division==
Jičín consists of 12 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Dvorce (33)
*Holínské Předměstí (2,013)
*Hubálov (68)
*Moravčice (18)
*Nové Město (4,659)
*Popovice (405)
*Pražské Předměstí (244)
*Robousy (548)
*Sedličky (216)
*Soudná (209)
*Staré Město (507)
*Valdické Předměstí (6,984)
==Etymology==
The origin of the name Jičín is unknown, but according to the most probable hypotheses, it was derived from the German name of Queen Judith of Habsburg &quot;Guta&quot;, or from &quot;Dičín&quot;, derived from the Old Czech word &quot;dík&quot; (meaning &#x27;wild boar&#x27;, of which many lived here).

==Geography==
Jičín is located about northwest of Hradec Králové and northeast of Prague. It lies in the heart of the Jičín Uplands. The highest point is the hill Zebín at above sea level. The Cidlina River flows through the town. Several other small watercources also flow through the municipal territory, including the streams Valdický potok, Popovický potok, Úlibický potok and Trnávka. There are five fishponds in the territory; the largest of them is Šibeňák. Ponds Kníže and Šibeňák are located right in the urban area.

Jičín is sometimes called &quot;Gate to the Bohemian Paradise&quot;, however the territory of the Bohemian Paradise region begins beyond the borders of the Jičín municipal territory. In the northern part there are two nature monuments, Zebín (comprising the hill&#x27;s peak) and Libosad-obora (comprising the whole Libosad park).

==History==

The area of Jičín has been inhabited for almost 8,000 years thanks to the convenient geographical and climatic conditions. The settlement in the area of today&#x27;s town is first mentioned in 1143 in deed of foundation of the Strahov Monastery. The town of Jičín was founded in the 13th century on the place of the village Staré Místo near the Veliš Castle. It was moved northward to its present location shortly afterward, which was better protected by the Cidlina River. The first written mention of Jičín comes from a document by Queen Judith of Habsburg, the wife of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, dated 1 August 1293. The town was built with a regular street layout around a rectangular square and was surrounded by wooden fortifications with reinforced bastions and a trench.

Jičín was first the royal town, but in 1337 King John of Bohemia sold it to the Wartenberg family, who owned it until the middle of the 15th century. The Hussite Wars did not affect the town much. During the 15th century, Jičín changed its lords several times until 1487, when it became a property of the House of Trčka of Lípa. With the succession of Vilém Trčka in 1540, the town began to be rebuilt in stone. The fortifications were rebuilt as well, with three gates connecting the centre with peripheries: the western Pražská Gate, the northern Holínská Gate, and the eastern Valdická Gate (1568–1578), which is the only one preserved today. After a large fire in 1572, most of the wooden houses were replaced by stone Renaissance buildings, often decorated with sgrafitti; the parish church was rebuilt as well. In 1587, Burjan Trčka had built a small castle. In 1607, Jičín was acquired by Zikmund Smiřický. The Smiřický family had built here a new larger castle, which replaced the castle of the Trčka family.

The biggest expansion of the town started in 1621 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when the town became a property of the generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein, who made it the centre of his Duchy of Friedland and minted his own coins there. Several architects worked for him, notably Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni, Giovanni Battista Marini, Andrea Spezza, and Nicolo Sebregondi. He had the castle and the Church of St. James rebuilt completely in the North-Italian style and connected them via a roofed footbridge. The town was to be rebuilt completely into a modern town with separated representative and craftsman parts. The parish Church of St. Ignatius together with the college was given to the Jesuits in 1627. Wallenstein also had a summer house with a court of honor, farm buildings, and a game park built in the northern part of the town near Valdice, and a linden alley along the path leading to the summer house. After the early death of Wallenstein in 1634, the town lost much of its importance.

In 1710 the town became a property of the House of Trauttmansdorff, which meant the arrival of the period of High Baroque, during which many constructions were completed. Many statues and sculptures in the town today come from this period. In 1784 Jičín became the seat of a new region. During the first half of the 19th century the town spread quickly, especially eastward.

The Battle of Gitschin was fought nearby during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.

Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary, head of the Jicin – Jičín District, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

In 2019, the village of Hubálov, originally part of Tuř, was joined to Jičín. The transfer of the entire cadastral territory is unique in the modern history of the country.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Jičín lies at the crossroad of two main road: the I/16 (the section from Mladá Boleslav to Trutnov) and the I/35 (the section from Liberec to Hradec Králové). The I/32 road splits from the I/16 and connects Jičín with the D1 motorway.

Jičín is located on the railway lines Prague–Turnov and Hradec Králové–Turnov.

==Culture==
Jičín is connected with the popular fairy tale character, Robin Hood-like robber Rumcajs. The town hosts the annual festival called &quot;Jičín – The Town of Fairy Tale&quot; established in 1990.

==Sights==

The historic centre is built around a rectangular square with a regular Gothic street layout, remnants of fortifications and arcade Renaissance and Baroque houses.

The historic core is formed by Valdštejnské Square, where is the Valdštejnský Castle. The castle houses the Regional Museum and Gallery, a library and a primary art school, among others. There is also a castle park. Next to the castle is the Church of Saint James the Great. The church, intended as a seat of a never-established bishopric, has never been completed, so it lacks a spire and a cupola.

North of the town is the Baroque summer house of Albrecht von Wallenstein called Valdštejnská Loggia. The original game park around it is nowadays a park called Libosad. The loggia is connected with the town by a -long alley of linden trees. The loggia, the park and the alley together with the town centre are parts of so-called Wallenstein&#x27;s Baroque composed landscape (designed landscape axes connecting sacral buildings, landscape landmarks and the town) which was unfinished due to early death of von Wallenstein.

There are several Jewish sights in the town. The most notable is the former synagogue, which was first documented in 1773.

<text>In human genetics, the Y-chromosomal Adam (more technically known as the Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor, shortened to Y-MRCA), is the patrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) from whom all currently living humans are descended. He is the most recent male from whom all living humans are descended through an unbroken line of their male ancestors. The term Y-MRCA reflects the fact that the Y chromosomes of all currently living human males are directly derived from the Y chromosome of this remote ancestor. 

The analogous concept of the matrilineal most recent common ancestor is known as &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; (mt-MRCA, named for the matrilineal transmission of mtDNA), the most recent woman from whom all living humans are descended matrilineally. As with &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot;, the title of &quot;Y-chromosomal Adam&quot; is not permanently fixed to a single individual, but can advance over the course of human history as paternal lineages become extinct.

Estimates of the time when Y-MRCA lived have also shifted as modern knowledge of human ancestry changes. For example, in 2013, the discovery of a previously unknown Y-chromosomal haplogroup was announced,
which resulted in a slight adjustment of the estimated age of the human Y-MRCA.

By definition, it is not necessary that the Y-MRCA and the mt-MRCA should have lived at the same time.
While estimates as of 2014 suggested the possibility that the two individuals may well have been roughly contemporaneous, the discovery of the archaic Y-haplogroup has pushed back the estimated age of the Y-MRCA beyond the most likely age of the mt-MRCA. As of 2015, estimates of the age of the Y-MRCA range around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, roughly consistent with the emergence of anatomically modern humans.

Y-chromosomal data taken from a Neanderthal from El Sidrón, Spain, produced a Y-T-MRCA (time to Y-MRCA) of 588,000 years ago for Neanderthal and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; patrilineages, dubbed &quot;ante&quot; Adam, and 275,000 years ago for Y-MRCA.

==Definition==
The Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor is the most recent common ancestor of the Y-chromosomes found in currently living human males.

Due to the definition via the &quot;currently living&quot; population, the identity of a MRCA, and by extension of the human Y-MRCA, is time-dependent (it depends on the moment in time intended by the term &quot;currently&quot;).
The MRCA of a population may move forward in time as archaic lineages within the population go extinct:
once a lineage has died out, it is irretrievably lost. This mechanism can thus only shift the title of Y-MRCA forward in time. Such an event could be due to the total extinction of several basal haplogroups.
The same holds for the concepts of matrilineal and patrilineal MRCAs: it follows from the definition of Y-MRCA that he had at least two sons who both have unbroken lineages that have survived to the present day. If the lineages of all but one of those sons die out, then the title of Y-MRCA shifts forward from the remaining son through his patrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had at least two sons who both have living, patrilineal descendants. The title of Y-MRCA is not permanently fixed to a single individual, and the Y-MRCA for any given population would himself have been part of a population which had its own, more remote, Y-MRCA.

Although the informal name &quot;Y-chromosomal Adam&quot; is a reference to the biblical Adam, this should not be misconstrued as implying that the bearer of the chromosome was the only human male alive during his time. 
His other male contemporaries may also have descendants alive today, but not, by definition, through solely patrilineal descent; in other words, none of them have an unbroken male line of descendants (&quot;son&#x27;s son&#x27;s son&#x27;s … son&quot;) connecting them to currently living people.

By the nature of the concept of most recent common ancestors, these estimates can only represent a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; (&quot;limit before which&quot;), until the genome of the entire population has been examined (in this case, the genome of all living humans).

==Age estimate==
Estimates on the age of the Y-MRCA crucially depend on the most archaic known haplogroup extant in contemporary populations. , this is haplogroup A00 (discovered in 2013). Age estimates based on this published during 2014–2015 range between 160,000 and 300,000 years, compatible with the time of emergence and early dispersal of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

===Method===
In addition to the tendency of the title of Y-MRCA to shift forward in time, the estimate of the Y-MRCA&#x27;s DNA sequence, his position in the family tree, the time when he lived, and his place of origin, are all subject to future revisions.

The following events would change the estimate of who the individual designated as Y-MRCA was:
* Further sampling of Y chromosomes could uncover previously unknown divergent lineages. If this happens, Y-chromosome lineages would converge on an individual who lived further back in time.
* The discovery of additional deep rooting mutations in known lineages could lead to a rearrangement of the family tree.
* Revision of the Y-chromosome mutation rate (see below) can change the estimate of the time when he lived.

The time when Y-MRCA lived is determined by applying a molecular clock to human Y-chromosomes. In contrast to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which has a short sequence of 16,000 base pairs, and mutates frequently, the Y chromosome is significantly longer at 60 million base pairs, and has a lower mutation rate. These features of the Y chromosome have slowed down the identification of its polymorphisms; as a consequence, they have reduced the accuracy of Y-chromosome mutation rate estimates.

Methods of estimating the age of the Y-MRCA for a population of human males whose Y-chromosomes have been sequenced are based on applying the theories of molecular evolution to the Y chromosome. Unlike the autosomes, the human Y-chromosome does not recombine often with the X chromosome during meiosis, but is usually transferred intact from father to son; however, it can recombine with the X chromosome in the pseudoautosomal regions at the ends of the Y chromosome. Mutations occur periodically within the Y chromosome, and these mutations are passed on to males in subsequent generations.

These mutations can be used as markers to identify shared patrilineal relationships. Y chromosomes that share a specific mutation are referred to as haplogroups. Y chromosomes within a specific haplogroup are assumed to share a common patrilineal ancestor who was the first to carry the defining mutation. (This assumption could be mistaken, as it is possible for the same mutation to occur more than once.) A family tree of Y chromosomes can be constructed, with the mutations serving as branching points along lineages. The Y-MRCA is positioned at the root of the family tree, as the Y chromosomes of all living males are descended from his Y chromosome.

Researchers can reconstruct ancestral Y chromosome DNA sequences by reversing mutated DNA segments to their original condition. The most likely original or ancestral state of a DNA sequence is determined by comparing human DNA sequences with those of a closely related species, usually non-human primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas. By reversing known mutations in a Y-chromosome lineage, a hypothetical ancestral sequence for the MRCA, Y-chromosomal Adam, can be inferred.

Determining the Y-MRCA&#x27;s DNA sequence, and the time when he lived, involves identifying the human Y-chromosome lineages that are most divergent from each other—the lineages that share the fewest mutations with each other when compared to a non-human primate sequence in a phylogenetic tree. The common ancestor of the most divergent lineages is therefore the common ancestor of all lineages.

===History of estimates===
Early estimates of the age for the Y-MRCA published during the 1990s ranged between roughly 200 and 300 thousand years ago (kya). 
Such estimates were later substantially revised downward, as in Thomson &quot;et al.&quot; 2000, which proposed an age of about 59,000.
This date suggested that the Y-MRCA lived about 84,000 years after his female counterpart mt-MRCA (the matrilineal most recent common ancestor), who lived 150,000–200,000 years ago.
This date also meant that Y-chromosomal Adam lived at a time very close to, and possibly after, the migration from Africa which is believed to have taken place 50,000–80,000 years ago.
One explanation given for this discrepancy in the time depths of patrilineal vs. matrilineal lineages was that females have a better chance of reproducing than males due to the practice of polygyny. When a male individual has several wives, he has effectively prevented other males in the community from reproducing and passing on their Y chromosomes to subsequent generations. On the other hand, polygyny does not prevent most females in a community from passing on their mitochondrial DNA to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success of males and females can lead to fewer male lineages relative to female lineages persisting into the future. These fewer male lineages are more sensitive to drift and would most likely coalesce on a more recent common ancestor. This would potentially explain the more recent dates associated with the Y-MRCA.

The &quot;hyper-recent&quot; estimate of significantly below 100 kya was again corrected upward in studies of the early 2010s, which ranged at about 120 kya to 160 kya.
This revision was due to the rearrangement of the backbone of the Y-chromosome phylogeny following the resequencing of Haplogroup A lineages.
In 2013, Francalacci &quot;et al.&quot; reported the sequencing of male-specific single-nucleotide Y-chromosome polymorphisms (MSY-SNPs) from 1204 Sardinian males, which indicated an estimate of 180,000 to 200,000 years for the common origin of all humans through paternal lineage.
Also in 2013, Poznik &quot;et al.&quot; reported the Y-MRCA to have lived between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago, based on genome sequencing of 69 men from 9 different populations.
In addition, the same study estimated the age of Mitochondrial Eve to about 99,000 and 148,000 years. As these ranges overlap for a time-range of 28,000 years (148 to 120 kya), the results of this study have been cast in terms of the possibility that &quot;Genetic Adam and Eve may have walked on Earth at the same time&quot; in the popular press.

The announcement by Mendez &quot;et al.&quot; of the discovery of a previously unknown lineage, haplogroup A00, in 2013, resulted in another shift in the estimate for the age of Y-chromosomal Adam. The authors estimated the split from the other haplogroups at 338,000 years ago (95% confidence interval 237–581 kya), but later Elhaik &quot;et al.&quot; (2014) dated it to between 163,900 and 260,200 years ago (95% CI), and Karmin &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) dated it to between 192,000 and 307,000 years ago (95% CI). The same study reports that non-African populations converge to a cluster of Y-MRCAs in a window close to 50 kya (out-of-Africa migration), and an additional bottleneck for non-African populations at about 10 kya, interpreted as reflecting cultural changes increasing the variance in male reproductive success (i.e. increased social stratification) in the Neolithic.

==Family tree==
Initial sequencing (Karafet et al., 2008) of the human Y chromosome suggested that two most basal Y-chromosome lineages were Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT. Haplogroup A is found at low frequencies in parts of Africa, but is common among certain hunter-gatherer groups. Haplogroup BT lineages represent the majority of African Y-chromosome lineages and virtually all non-African lineages. Y-chromosomal Adam was represented as the root of these two lineages. Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT represented the lineages of Y-chromosomal Adam himself and of one of his sons, who had a new SNP.

Cruciani et al. 2011, determined that the deepest split in the Y-chromosome tree was found between two previously reported subclades of Haplogroup A, rather than between Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT. Later, group A00 was found, outside of the previously known tree.
The rearrangement of the Y-chromosome family tree implies that lineages classified as Haplogroup A do not necessarily form a monophyletic clade. Haplogroup A therefore refers to a collection of lineages that do not possess the markers that define Haplogroup BT, though Haplogroup A includes the most distantly related Y chromosomes.

The M91 and P97 mutations distinguish Haplogroup A from Haplogroup BT. Within Haplogroup A chromosomes, the M91 marker consists of a stretch of 8 T nucleobase units. In Haplogroup BT and chimpanzee chromosomes, this marker consists of 9 T nucleobase units. This pattern suggested that the 9T stretch of Haplogroup BT was the ancestral version and that Haplogroup A was formed by the deletion of one nucleobase. Haplogroups A1b and A1a were considered subclades of Haplogroup A as they both possessed the M91 with 8Ts.

But according to Cruciani et al. 2011, the region surrounding the M91 marker is a mutational hotspot prone to recurrent mutations. It is therefore possible that the 8T stretch of Haplogroup A may be the ancestral state of M91 and the 9T of Haplogroup BT may be the derived state that arose by an insertion of 1T. This would explain why subclades A1b and A1a-T, the deepest branches of Haplogroup A, both possess the same version of M91 with 8Ts. Furthermore, Cruciani et al. 2011 determined that the P97 marker, which is also used to identify Haplogroup A, possessed the ancestral state in Haplogroup A but the derived state in Haplogroup BT.

==Likely geographic origin==

As current estimates on TMRCA converge with estimates for the age of anatomically modern humans
and well predate the Out of Africa migration, geographical origin hypotheses continue to be limited to the African continent.

According to Cruciani &quot;et al.&quot; 2011, the most basal lineages have been detected in West, Northwest and Central Africa, suggesting plausibility for the Y-MRCA living in the general region of &quot;Central-Northwest Africa&quot;.

Scozzari &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) agreed with a plausible placement in &quot;the north-western quadrant of the African continent&quot; for the emergence of the A1b haplogroup.
 The 2013 report of haplogroup A00 found among the Mbo people of western present-day Cameroon is also compatible with this picture.

The revision of Y-chromosomal phylogeny since 2011 has affected estimates for the likely geographical origin of Y-MRCA as well as estimates on time depth. By the same reasoning, future discovery of presently-unknown archaic haplogroups in living people would again lead to such revisions. In particular, the possible presence of between 1% and 4% Neanderthal-derived DNA in Eurasian genomes implies that the (unlikely) event of a discovery of a single living Eurasian male exhibiting a Neanderthal patrilineal line would immediately push back T-MRCA (&quot;time to MRCA&quot;) to at least twice its current estimate. However, the discovery of a Neanderthal Y-chromosome by Mendez &quot;et al&quot;. suggests the extinction of Neanderthal patrilineages, as the lineage inferred from the Neanderthal sequence is outside of the range of contemporary human genetic variation. Questions of geographical origin would become part of the debate on Neanderthal evolution from &quot;Homo erectus&quot;.

<text>Hypertensive retinopathy is damage to the retina and retinal circulation due to high blood pressure (i.e. hypertension).

==Signs and symptoms==
Most patients with hypertensive retinopathy have no symptoms. However, some may report decreased or blurred vision, and headaches.

===Signs===
Signs of damage to the retina caused by hypertension include:

* Arteriolar changes, such as generalized arteriolar narrowing, focal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, changes in the arteriolar wall (arteriosclerosis) and abnormalities at points where arterioles and venules cross. Manifestations of these changes include &quot;Copper wire arterioles&quot; where the central light reflex occupies most of the width of the arteriole and &quot;Silver wire arterioles&quot; where the central light reflex occupies all of the width of the arteriole, and &quot;arterio-venular (AV) nicking&quot; or &quot;AV nipping&quot;, due to venous constriction and banking.
* Advanced retinopathy lesions, such as microaneurysms, blot hemorrhages and/or flame hemorrhages, ischemic changes (e.g. &quot;cotton wool spots&quot;), hard exudates and in severe cases swelling of the optic disc (optic disc edema), a ring of exudates around the retina called a &quot;macular star&quot; and visual acuity loss, typically due to macular involvement.
* Strongly modulated blood flow pulse in central and branch arteries can result from hypertension. Microangiography by laser Doppler imaging may reveal altered hemodynamics non-invasively.

Mild signs of hypertensive retinopathy can be seen quite frequently in normal people (3–14% of adult individuals aged ≥40 years), even without hypertension. Hypertensive retinopathy is commonly considered a diagnostic feature of a hypertensive emergency although it is not invariably present.

==Pathophysiology==
The changes in hypertensive retinopathy result from damage and adaptive changes in the arterial and arteriolar circulation in response to the high blood pressure.

==Diagnosis==
Fundoscopy and patients history.
===Differential Diagnoses===
Several other diseases can result in retinopathy that can be confused with hypertensive retinopathy. These include diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy due to autoimmune disease, anemia, radiation retinopathy, and central retinal vein occlusion.
===Keith Wagener Barker (KWB) Grades===
;Grade 1
:Vascular Attenuation
;Grade 2
:As grade 1 + Irregularly located, tight constrictions – Known as &quot;AV nicking&quot; or &quot;AV nipping&quot; – Salus&#x27;s sign
;Grade 3
:As grade 2 + Retinal edema, cotton wool spots and flame-hemorrhages &quot;Copper Wiring&quot; + Bonnet&#x27;s Sign + Gunn&#x27;s Sign
;Grade 4
:As grade 3 + optic disc edema + macular star &quot;Silver Wiring&quot;

There is an association between the grade of retinopathy and mortality. In a classic study in 1939 Keith and colleagues described the prognosis of people with differing severity of retinopathy. They showed 70% of those with grade 1 retinopathy were alive after 3 years whereas only 6% of those with grade 4 survived. The most widely used modern classification system bears their name. The role of retinopathy grading in risk stratification is debated, but it has been proposed that individuals with signs of hypertensive retinopathy signs, especially retinal hemorrhages, microaneurysms and cotton-wool spots, should be assessed carefully.

==Management==
A major aim of treatment is to prevent, limit, or reverse target organ damage by lowering the person&#x27;s high blood pressure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Treatment with antihypertensive medications may be required to control the high blood pressure.

<text>Vera Mary Brittain (29 December 1893 – 29 March 1970) was an English Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse, writer, feminist, socialist and pacifist. Her best-selling 1933 memoir &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; recounted her experiences during the First World War and the beginning of her journey towards pacifism.

==Life and work==
Born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England, Vera Brittain was the daughter of a well-to-do paper manufacturer, (Thomas) Arthur Brittain (1864–1935) and his wife, Edith Mary (Bervon) Brittain (1868–1948). Her father was a director of family-owned paper mills in Hanley and Cheddleton. Her mother was born in Aberystwyth, Wales, the daughter of an impoverished musician, John Inglis Bervon.

When Brittain was 18 months old, her family moved to Macclesfield, Cheshire, and 10 years later, in 1905, they moved again, to the spa town of Buxton in Derbyshire. As Brittain was growing up, her only sibling, her brother Edward, nearly two years her junior, was her closest companion. From the age of 13, she attended boarding-school at St Monica&#x27;s, Kingswood, Surrey where her mother&#x27;s sister, Aunt Florence (Miss Bervon), was co-principal with Louise Heath-Jones, who had attended Newnham College, Cambridge.

After two years as a &quot;provincial debutante&quot;, Brittain overcame her father&#x27;s objections and went up to Somerville College, Oxford, to read English Literature. By this time, war had broken out and Brittain had become close to Roland Leighton, one of her brother&#x27;s friends from Uppingham School. Finding her Oxford studies increasingly an irrelevance as her male contemporaries volunteered for war, Brittain delayed her degree after one year in the summer of 1915 to work as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse for much of the First World War. She served initially at the Devonshire Hospital in Buxton, and later in London, Malta and in France. While stationed close to the front at Etaples, her experience nursing German prisoners of war significantly influenced her journey towards internationalism and pacifism.

Roland Leighton, who became her fiancé in August 1915, close friends Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow, and finally her brother Edward were all killed in the war. Many of their letters to each other are reproduced in the book &quot;Letters from a Lost Generation&quot;. In one letter, Leighton speaks for his generation of public-school volunteers when he writes that he feels the need to play an &quot;active part&quot; in the war.

Returning to Oxford in 1919 to read history, Brittain found it difficult as &quot;a war survivor&quot; to adjust to life in postwar society. She met Winifred Holtby at Somerville, and a close friendship developed. They both aspired to become established on the London literary scene, and shared various London flats after coming down from Oxford. Eventually Holtby would become part of the Brittain-Catlin household after Brittain&#x27;s marriage. The bond lasted until Holtby&#x27;s death from kidney failure in 1935. Other literary contemporaries at Somerville included Dorothy L. Sayers, Hilda Reid, Margaret Kennedy and Sylvia Thompson.

In 1925, Brittain married George Catlin, a political scientist (1896–1979). Their son, John Brittain-Catlin (1927–1987), whose relationship with his mother steadily deteriorated as he got older, was an artist, painter, businessman and the author of the posthumously published autobiography &quot;Family Quartet&quot;, which appeared in 1987. Their daughter, born 1930, was the former Labour Cabinet Minister, later Liberal Democrat peer, Shirley Williams (1930–2021), one of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; rebels on the Social Democratic wing of the Labour Party who founded the SDP in 1981. Like Brittain, George Catlin was raised Anglican, as his father was an Anglican clergyman, but unlike her, Catlin had converted to the Catholic Church.

Brittain&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;The Dark Tide&quot; (1923), created scandal as it caricatured dons at Oxford, especially at Somerville. In 1933, she published the work for which she became famous, &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;, followed in 1940 by &quot;Testament of Friendship&quot;— her tribute to and biography of Winifred Holtby —and &quot;Testament of Experience&quot; (1957), the continuation of her own story, which spanned the years between 1925 and 1950. Brittain based many of her novels on actual experiences and actual people. In this regard, her novel &quot;Honourable Estate&quot; (1936) was autobiographical, dealing with her failed friendship with the novelist Phyllis Bentley, her romantic feelings for her American publisher George Brett Jr, and her brother Edward&#x27;s death in action on the Italian Front in 1918. Brittain&#x27;s diaries from 1913 to 1917 were published in 1981 as &quot;Chronicle of Youth&quot;. Some critics have argued that &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; often differs markedly from Brittain&#x27;s writings during the war, especially in respect of her attitudes towards the war, which were more conventional in 1914–18.

In the 1920s, Brittain was a widely published journalist, in &quot;Time and Tide&quot; and many other newspapers and journals. At this time, she also became a regular speaker on behalf of the League of Nations Union, supporting the idea of collective security. However, in June 1936, in the wake of the bestsellerdom of &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; on both sides of the Atlantic, she was invited to speak at a vast peace rally at Maumbury Rings in Dorchester, where she shared a platform with various pacifists, including sponsors of the Peace Pledge Union, the largest pacifist organisation in Britain: Dick Sheppard, George Lansbury, Laurence Housman, and Donald Soper. Afterwards, Sheppard invited her to join the Peace Pledge Union as sponsor. Following six months&#x27; careful reflection, she replied in January 1937 to say she would. Later that year, Brittain also joined the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship. Her newly found pacifism, increasingly Christian in inspiration, came to the fore during the Second World War, when she began the series of &quot;Letters to Peacelovers&quot;.

She was a practical pacifist in the sense that she helped the war effort by working as a fire warden and by travelling around the country raising funds for the Peace Pledge Union&#x27;s food relief campaign. She was vilified for speaking out against saturation bombing of German cities through her 1944 booklet, published as &quot;Seed of Chaos&quot; in Britain and as &quot;Massacre by Bombing&quot; in the United States. In 1945, the Nazis&#x27; Black Book of nearly 3,000 people to be immediately arrested in Britain after a German invasion was shown to include her name.

From the 1930s onwards, Brittain was a regular contributor to the pacifist magazine &quot;Peace News&quot;. She eventually became a member of the magazine&#x27;s editorial board and during the 1950s and 1960s was &quot;writing articles against apartheid and colonialism and in favour of nuclear disarmament&quot;.

In November 1966, she suffered a fall in a badly lit London street en route to a speaking engagement at St Martin-in-the-Fields. She attended the engagement, but afterwards found she had fractured her left arm and broken the little finger of her right hand. These injuries began a physical decline in which her mind became more confused and withdrawn.
Around this time, the BBC interviewed her; when asked of her memories of Roland Leighton, she replied: &quot;Who is Roland&quot;?

Brittain never fully got over the death in June 1918 of her beloved brother, Edward. She died in Wimbledon on 29 March 1970, aged 76. Her will requested that her ashes be scattered on Edward&#x27;s grave on the Asiago Plateau in Italy – &quot;...for nearly 50 years much of my heart has been in that Italian village cemetery&quot;— and her daughter honoured this request in September 1970. Some of Brittain&#x27;s ashes were buried in 1979 in the grave of her husband Sir George Catlin in the churchyard of St James the Great, at Old Milverton in Warwickshire.

==Cultural legacy==
Brittain was portrayed by Cheryl Campbell in the 1979 BBC2 television adaptation of &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;.

Songwriter and fellow Anglican Pacifist Fellowship member Sue Gilmurray wrote a song in Brittain&#x27;s memory, titled &quot;Vera&quot;.

In 1996, The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century documentary series aired on PBS. It chronicles World War I over eight episodes. Brittian&#x27;s writings and experiences are covered in Episode 3 &quot;Total War&quot;.

In 1998, Brittain&#x27;s First World War letters were edited by Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge and published under the title &quot;Letters from a Lost Generation&quot;. They were also adapted by Bostridge for a BBC Radio 4 series starring Amanda Root and Rupert Graves.

&quot;Because You Died&quot;, a new selection of Brittain&#x27;s First World War poetry and prose, edited by Mark Bostridge, was published by Virago in 2008 to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Armistice.

On 9 November 2008, BBC One broadcast an hour-length television documentary on Brittain as part of its Remembrance Day programmes hosted by Jo Brand titled &quot;A Woman in Love and War: Vera Brittain&quot;, where she was portrayed by Katherine Manners.

In February 2009, it was reported that BBC Films was to adapt Brittain&#x27;s memoir &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; into a feature film. Irish actress Saoirse Ronan was cast to play Brittain at first. However, in December 2013, it was announced that Swedish actress Alicia Vikander would be playing Brittain in the film, which was released at the end of 2014 as part of the First World War commemorations. The film also starred Kit Harington, Colin Morgan, Taron Egerton, Alexandra Roach, Dominic West, Emily Watson, Joanna Scanlan, Hayley Atwell, Jonathan Bailey and Anna Chancellor. David Heyman (producer of the Harry Potter films) and Rosie Alison were the producers.

On 9 November 2018, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion commentary by Aaron Schnoor honoured the poetry of the First World War, including Brittain&#x27;s poem &quot;Perhaps&quot;.

On 7 July 2023, Buxton Festival staged the first of a run of performances of &quot;The Land of Might-Have-Been&quot;, a musical show drawing on existing songs by Ivor Novello, presenting a fictionalised version of Brittain&#x27;s life in 1914 and 1915, and exploring her relationships with Roland, Edward and Edward&#x27;s (fictional) gay lover Bobbie Jones, and the impact the war had on them.

Plaques marking Brittain&#x27;s former homes can be seen at 9 Sidmouth Avenue, Newcastle-under-Lyme; 151 Park Road, Buxton; Doughty Street, Bloomsbury; and 117 Wymering Mansions, Maida Vale, west London. There is also a plaque in the Buxton Pavilion Gardens, commemorating Brittain&#x27;s residence in the town, though the dates shown on the plaque for her time there are incorrect.

Vera Brittain&#x27;s archive was sold in 1971 to McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A further collection of papers, amassed during the writing of the authorised biography of Brittain, was donated to Somerville College Library, Oxford, by Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge.

<doc id="247449" wikidata="Q2406418" url="?curid=247449" title="Testament of Youth">
<text>Testament of Youth is a memoir of British nurse and activist Vera Brittain (1893–1970), published in 1933. Brittain&#x27;s memoir covers the years 1900 to 1925, and continues with &quot;Testament of Experience&quot;, published in 1957, and encompassing the years 1925 to 1950. Between these two books comes &quot;Testament of Friendship&quot; (published in 1940), which is essentially a memoir of Brittain&#x27;s close colleague and friend Winifred Holtby. A final segment of memoir, to be called &quot;Testament of Faith&quot; or &quot;Testament of Time&quot;, was planned by Brittain but remained unfinished at her death.

&quot;Testament of Youth&quot; has been acclaimed as a classic for its description of the impact of World War I on the lives of women and the middle-class civilian population of the United Kingdom. The book shows how the impact extended into the postwar years. It is also considered a classic in feminist literature for its depiction of a woman&#x27;s pioneering struggle to forge an independent career in a society only grudgingly tolerant of educated women.

==Narrative==
In the foreword, Brittain describes how she originally intended to write of her experiences as a novel but was unable to achieve the necessary objective distance from her subject. She then tried to publish her original diary from the war years but with all names fictionalised. This too proved unworkable. Only then did she decide to write her personal story, putting her experiences in the wider historic and social context. Several critics have noted the cathartic process by which the memoir deals with her grief at the loss of young men close to her: brother Edward Brittain, her fiancé Roland Leighton, and her friends Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow.

The narrative begins with Vera&#x27;s plans to enter Somerville College, Oxford, and her romance with Roland Leighton, a friend of her brother Edward. Both were commissioned as officers early in World War I, and both were subsequently killed, as were several other members of their social circle.

The book&#x27;s main subject is Vera&#x27;s work as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse, nursing wounded soldiers in London, Malta and at Etaples in France. It also describes how she returned, disillusioned, to Somerville College after the war and completed her BA degree. It covers the beginning of her career in journalism, writing for &quot;Time and Tide&quot; and lecturing for the League of Nations. She visits the graves of her brother Edward in Italy and her fiancé Roland in France. Together with Winifred Holtby she toured the defeated and occupied regions of Germany and Austria in 1923.

It concludes with her meeting her husband George Catlin and their eventual marriage in 1925.

==Publication of source materials==
Between 1922 and 1924, Brittain had attempted to edit her war diaries for publication in response to a publisher&#x27;s competition; however, when they were not selected, she focused for a time on fiction and journalism before ultimately adapting them into her memoir in 1933. The diaries on which the book is partly based were edited by Alan Bishop and published as &quot;Chronicle of Youth&quot; in 1981. In 1998, the war letters which Brittain also drew on in her autobiography were published in an edition by Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge. Entitled &quot;Letters from a Lost Generation&quot;, their appearance was met with considerable acclaim.

==Adaptations==
The book was dramatised by Elaine Morgan as a five-part serial which was transmitted on BBC2 in 1979. This version features Cheryl Campbell as Vera Brittain, Peter Woodward as Roland Leighton, Joanna McCallum as Winifred Holtby and Emrys James and Jane Wenham as Vera&#x27;s parents.

In 1998, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Armistice, a 15-part radio dramatisation of the letters on which &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; was partly based was broadcast on BBC Radio Four. Entitled &quot;Letters from a Lost Generation&quot;, it was dramatised by Mark Bostridge and starred Amanda Root as Vera Brittain and Rupert Graves as Roland Leighton.

In 2009, it was announced that the feature film &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; was in development by BBC Films and Heyday Films producer David Heyman, and was to be directed by James Kent. This had the support of the Vera Brittain Estate, Brittain&#x27;s daughter Shirley Williams, and Brittain&#x27;s biographer Mark Bostridge who acted as a consultant. Saoirse Ronan was cast to play Brittain in 2012 but was replaced in December 2013 when it was announced that Alicia Vikander would play Vera Brittain in the film which was released in late 2014 as part of the First World War commemorations. On 4 February 2014, Kit Harington joined the cast to play the role of Brittain&#x27;s fiancé Roland Leighton. On 13 February 2014, Colin Morgan, Taron Egerton, and Alexandra Roach were announced to have joined the film&#x27;s cast. An ensemble cast was later confirmed as filming began, including Dominic West, Emily Watson, Joanna Scanlan, Hayley Atwell, Jonathan Bailey and Anna Chancellor. It substituted Merton College, Oxford in the scenes showing Brittain&#x27;s time as a student at Somerville College, arguing that filming in Somerville itself would have been too difficult in light of the new buildings constructed there since the film&#x27;s time period.

==Criticism==
A book by Brittain&#x27;s biographer and editor Mark Bostridge, entitled &quot;Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth&quot; was published by Bloomsbury in December 2014. It looks at early versions of the book in the wake of the new film adaptation.

<text>The Welsh Corgi ( or Corgi, plural Corgis, or occasionally the etymologically consistent Corgwn; ) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name &quot;corgi&quot; is thought to be derived from the Welsh words and (which is mutated to ), meaning &quot;dwarf&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;, respectively.

Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Physical differences are seen between the two breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and height, and has a much longer tail than the Pembroke.

Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 14th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.

The Pembroke is the more popular of the two, yet still appears on the Kennel Club&#x27;s vulnerable dog breeds of the United Kingdom list. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained in popularity because Elizabeth II had personally owned more than 30 Pembrokes or Corgi-Dachshund crosses, known as &quot;dorgis&quot;.

==History==
Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are adjoining historical agricultural counties in South West Wales. Welsh Corgis were cattle herding dogs, the type of herding dog referred to as &quot;heelers&quot;, meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move. The combination of their low height off the ground and the innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. In the Welsh language, the word &quot;Corgi&quot; literally translates to dwarf dog (&quot;cor&quot; = dwarf, &quot;gi&quot; = lenitive of &quot;ci&quot;, dog). In Welsh, the term can also be used more broadly to mean a cur or a working dog. Different tales have been told of the Corgi&#x27;s origin; some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories on the origin of the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either Deutsche Bracken or Dachshund.

The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has been attributed to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. In the late 19th century, farmers began to switch from cattle to sheep, but the Corgi is not suited for working sheep. Similarities between the Welsh Corgis have been attributed to crossbreeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from those who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke.

The first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members. A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis began to appear in conformation shows. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of this club were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point, the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number of disputes between breeders of the two types in early shows, as judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them. The Welsh Corgi appeared at Crufts—a dog show held annually in the United Kingdom—for the first time in 1927.

The first championship was awarded at a Cardiff show in 1928, to a red and white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds continued to be judged together until 1934, when the Kennel Club recognized each breed separately. In that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed to which each dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who were free to choose whichever they felt was the most appropriate. The first dog to be named best-in-show at an open conformation show was Ch. Bowhit Pivot.

Cardigan Welsh Corgis continued to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 by the end of the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the postwar years in the United Kingdom; in 1953, it was ranked as the fourth-most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the German Shepherd, and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi &quot;Kaytop Maracas Mint&quot;. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.

The Cardigan Welsh Corgi was listed in the Kennel Club&#x27;s first list of Vulnerable Native Breeds in 2006. This list is for those breeds which register less than 300 dogs in any one year; there had been 84 Cardigan Corgis registered in 2006. After an initial increase, this declined to 46 in 2010, but then rose to the highest numbers since the list began in 2015, with a total of 124 puppies registered. In 2013, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was also added, as there had been only 241 puppies registered that year. While the Kennel Club blamed this decline on the importation of foreign dog breeds, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; faulted the UK&#x27;s 2006 Animal Welfare Act, which banned tail-docking for cosmetic purposes. However, 2015 had an increase of 34% in the number of Pembroke registrations; the popularity of Corgis on Instagram was credited for the change. Pembrokes were removed from the Vulnerable Native Breeds list in 2016.

===United States===
In 1933, the first Welsh Corgis were brought to the United States by American breeder Mrs. Lewis Roesler, for her Merriedip Kennels in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts. She had previously been well known for breeding Old English Sheepdogs. Roesler purchased a Pembroke Corgi, Little Madam, at London&#x27;s Paddington Station for £12. Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several Corgi kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the first registered animal of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr. E.M. Tidd in Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots, which he had purchased in Canada.

Tidd imported Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding lines in 1935, registering him with the AKC as Sierra Bowhit Pivot. In addition to his British titles, he became the first Corgi to be awarded the champion status in the US, and the first such dog to be named Best of Group at a conformation show in the United States. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi club was formed in 1937, and the first show was held at Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge&#x27;s Giralda Farms in New Jersey. Following the Second World War, imports from the United Kingdom included Rozavel Uncle Sam, which dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of best-in-show at an open conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 37th-most popular breed of dog in the US.

A pair of Cardigan Welsh Corgis was imported to the US in 1931, but the first member of that breed to be registered with the AKC was Blodwen of Robinscroft in 1935. They have never had the draw in the US given to the Corgis of the Pembroke type. In 1997, some 752 Cardigan Welsh Corgis were registered with the AKC, compared to 8,281 of the Pembrokes.

==Modern breeds==

The two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, are named for the counties in Wales where they originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water-resistant and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer than that of the Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. They are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, nor have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. Only minor differences in the shape of the head are seen; both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke and has a larger nose. A few days following birth may be needed for the true color of a Corgi&#x27;s coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolor or black and tan markings.
Corgis in the modern era often compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Cardigan and Pembroke Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials – known colloquially as a &quot;mad run&quot;. Welsh Corgis were once used to guard children.

===Cardigan Welsh Corgi===

The differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large, rounded ears and a , fox-like, flowing tail set in line with the body. Though the Cardigan is allowed more colors than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its coat. The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog&#x27;s undercoat is short, soft, and thick. According to the breed standard, the breed stands between at the withers, and should weigh . The skeletal structure of the Cardigan differs from the Pembroke, in that a more exaggerated bend exists in the front two legs, which fits around the ribcage of the animal. In addition, the Cardigan is more heavily set than the Pembroke, with denser bone mass.

A greater number of colours of coat is present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed standard allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable, and brindle. White markings are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle. Several disqualification criteria are used in the breed standard for the purpose of confirmation shows. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes, or nonsolid black noses in dogs without merle coloration.

===Pembroke Welsh Corgi===

Pembrokes feature pointed ears, and are somewhat smaller in stature than the Cardigan. They are low-set, intelligent, strong, and sturdy with stamina sufficient to work a day on the farm. The common height at the withers is , while a male dog of this breed should weigh no more than , and a female . The tail is shorter than that of a Cardigan, which can be accomplished through breeding or docking. Historically, the Pembroke was a breed with a natural bobtail (a very short tail). Due to the advent of tail docking in dogs, the bobtail was not aggressively pursued, with breeders focusing, instead, on other characteristics, and the tail was artificially shortened if need be. Given that some countries now ban docking, some breeders are again attempting to select dogs with the genes for natural bobtails.

Fewer colours of coat appear in the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn, and black, each of which can be with or without white markings. Plain white or grey coats can also be seen, but these would be considered to be a serious fault for the purposes of conformation shows. However, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard.

Pembroke Welsh Corgis have two coats that vary in length along their body. The first coat is a shorter, inner coat that is resistant to harsh weather, while the outer coat is rougher and longer, but still of medium length. The length of the coat differs on various parts of the body. Fur tends to be longer and thicker behind their fore and hind legs, as well as underneath their bodies. In addition, they appear to have more voluminous fur on their chest, neck, and shoulders. Pembroke Welsh corgis have shedding coats.

==Health==

According to the Kennel Club &quot;Purebred Dog Health Survey&quot; conducted in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans; the median age at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The main causes of death were similar in both breeds; the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed a higher proportion of deaths attributed to either kidney failure or urethral obstruction. The survey showed that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions with one exception: Whereas more than a quarter of Pembroke Welsh Corgis surveyed suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which is more common in older dogs. Cataracts in Corgis are treatable with cataract extraction. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskeletal issues, including arthritis. However, hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.

==Cultural impact==
===British royal family===

Queen Elizabeth II had a long association with Corgis, and she reportedly had said, &quot;my Corgis are family&quot;. After a visit to Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath in 1933, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made it well known to their family that they liked the Corgis owned by the Marquess. Their father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), purchased the Pembroke Corgi Rozavel Golden Eagle, from the Rozavel kennels in Surrey. It was renamed Dookie.

Princess Elizabeth was then given a Pembroke Corgi of her own, named Susan, for her 18th birthday in 1944. She had a strong connection to the dog, which was hidden under rugs in the Royal Carriage following her wedding to Prince Philip. Susan became the progenitor of all the Corgis later owned by the royal household. The Queen bred 10 generations of dogs from Susan, owning personally more than 30 of the dogs, which were either purebred Pembroke Welsh Corgis or crossbreed Corgi/Dachshunds called Dorgis. The corgis whose names included Whisky, Sherry, Mint, Dash, and Disco slept in wicker baskets lined with cushions in their own room. Their diet, prepared by a &quot;gourmet chef&quot;, reportedly included fresh rabbit and beef.

In 2018, the last of the Corgis belonging to Queen Elizabeth, and descended from Susan, was reported to have died. However, in 2021 during the COVID-19 lockdown, her son, Prince Andrew, gave her a Corgi named Muick. This was followed by the gift from Andrew&#x27;s daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, of another Corgi named Sandy to mark her 95th official birthday. Upon the death of the Queen in September 2022, Prince Andrew and his former wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, were to take care of Muick and Sandy.

===Other cultural impact===
Corgis have also appeared on screen, on stage, and in novels. Corgis as characters were incorporated into the storybook fantasies &quot;Corgiville Fair&quot;, &quot;The Great Corgiville Kidnapping&quot;, and &quot;Corgiville Christmas&quot; of American author and illustrator Tasha Tudor. In the 1961 Elvis film &quot;Blue Hawaii,&quot; a local Corgi appeared in a scene to help fetch a towel. In 1963, a Corgi was featured in the Walt Disney film &quot;Little Dog Lost&quot;, which led to an increase in popularity for the breed within the United States. A theatrical adaptation took place of Welsh author Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;The BFG&quot; which toured the UK in 1991 required several different Corgis to perform on stage as those of Queen Elizabeth. &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Corgi&quot; is a Belgian animated film depicting the Queen&#x27;s Corgis.

In the anime &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, the crew has a super-intelligent Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Ein, on their ship. The &quot;Top Shelf&quot; graphic novel &quot;Korgi&quot; plays on the folklore tradition of the Corgi as a faerie draft animal. It features the &quot;Mollies&quot; (fairy-like beings) who live in close relationship with the land and their Korgi friends, who are based on and resemble the Welsh Corgi breeds. 

The royal Corgis appeared in Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s segment in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, when she is escorted by James Bond from Buckingham Palace to the stadium.

The American animated TV series &quot;Infinity Train&quot; features a country of anthropomorphic Corgis known as Coriginia ruled by King Atticus, styled &quot;Uniter of the Cardigans and Pembrokes&quot;.

In the American sitcom &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, the characters Captain Holt and Kevin Cozner co-own a Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Cheddar. Cheddar serves as comedic relief and makes reappearances in certain episodes each season.

<doc id="247460" wikidata="Q224981" url="?curid=247460" title="Yoko Kanno">
<text>is a Japanese composer, arranger and music producer of soundtracks for anime series, video games, television dramas and movies. She has written scores for &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Terror in Resonance&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot;, &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot;, &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; and &quot;Darker than Black&quot;. Kanno is a keyboardist and the frontwoman for Seatbelts, who perform many of her compositions.

== Early life ==
Yoko Kanno was born on 18 March 1963, in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Her earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.

Kanno attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. During this time, Kanno—whose parents had only allowed her to listen to classical music—was introduced to rhythm by a friend who played drums in a school band. She spoke of this experience in an interview with Akihiro Tomita:

While with this band, she studied the composition and style of popular music.

While at Waseda, the Japanese video game company Koei asked Kanno to compose the soundtrack to &quot;Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot;. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno&#x27;s music career was launched.

== Career ==
Yoko Kanno&#x27;s soundtrack themes include &quot;Kiseki no Umi&quot; (&quot;Lodoss War&quot;), &quot;Voices&quot; (&quot;Macross Plus&quot;), &quot;Tank!&quot; (&quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;), &quot;Yakusoku wa Iranai&quot; (&quot;Escaflowne&quot;), &quot;Gravity&quot; (&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot;), the whole soundtrack of Turn A Gundam, &quot;Inner Universe&quot; (&quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot;) and &quot;Stand Alone Complex O.S.T&quot;. In regards to making the &quot;Stand Alone Complex&quot; soundtrack, she said:

Having composed in various genres, including blues, classical, jazz, techno and J-pop, she was once asked if she favored a particular genre:

Since she works in the animation industry, she only receives instructions and storyboards from directors which helps her with composing. However, it is uncertain if all of her works are to be included in the finished project. She once said that this is a way she likes to work, for she does not have to deal with rules during composing. In reference to this, she once stated:

She was the lead member of the project band Seatbelts, which regrouped in 2004 to compose the soundtrack for the PlayStation 2 &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; video game (released in Japan in 2005).

She has composed for Koei games released during the late 1980s to early 1990s and for &quot;Napple Tale&quot;, a Dreamcast game. Due to her close involvement in the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; anime, the game released by Bandai also features her work.

Apart from anime and games, Kanno also composes for live-action films and television commercials. Some popular brands she has composed for are Canon, DoCoMo, Fuji Xerox, 7-Eleven, Microsoft, Nissan, Toyota, Shiseido, Avon and MasterCard to name a few. Her contributions to films started in the 1990s but only since 2002 has there been a trend towards the medium, with some of the latter being shown in international film festivals.
She attended Otakon and Anime Expo in 1999, as well as Anime Expo New York in 2002. In 2010, she made a surprise appearance at Anime Expo. Yoko Kanno performed her solo &quot;PianoMe&quot; concert at Otakon 2013.

She composed a three-movement suite, entitled &quot;Ray of Water,&quot; for the ascension of Emperor Naruhito. It was performed for him and Empress Masako at the enthronement celebration on 9 November 2019. Yoshikazu Okada wrote the lyrics for the vocal portion, which was performed at the celebration by the idol group, Arashi.

===Gabriela Robin===
On many of Kanno&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Gabriela Robin&quot; was credited as a lyricist and vocalist, but whenever these songs were performed in concert, either Maaya Sakamoto or Origa would perform them. In a 2009 written interview, Robin said that she would perform live for the first time at Kanno&#x27;s 2009 Tanabata Sonic concert. However, at the end of the concert - which featured Kanno directing the Warsaw Philharmonic - Kanno turned to the audience and sang &quot;Moon&quot;, a song previously attributed to Robin from the &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; soundtrack, revealing that &quot;Gabriela Robin&quot; was simply a pseudonym Kanno used to write songs mixing English and Japanese freely. In a later interview, Kanno said she picked the name because the first orchestral recording she had heard was the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and at the time Yitzhak Rabin served as Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister.

== Personal life ==
In addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French, but her English is poor and she needs translation help to converse in French. 

Commenting on spirituality and religion, Kanno has said:

Kanno enjoys music, photography, and writing. She has penned several journals for Newtype magazine, accompanying her articles with her own photographs for illustrations. Additionally, a collection of photographs taken by Kanno of her protégé and former production partner, Maaya Sakamoto, was showcased in the special event program for Sakamoto&#x27;s thirtieth birthday concert at Nippon Budokan in 2010.

In 2011, Yoko Kanno expressed her support for the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, composing a song titled . Later, she composed NHK&#x27;s official support song on the occasion of the first anniversary of the earthquake entitled , including lyrics by Sendai film director Shunji Iwai. The song features notable natives from the affected areas of Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate.

<text>Matthew Ryan Phillippe ( ; born September 10, 1974) is an American actor. After appearing as Billy Douglas on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1992–1993) and making his feature film debut in &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (1995), he came to prominence in the late 1990s with starring roles in &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997), &quot;54&quot; (1998), &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; (1998), and &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999).

Throughout the 2000s and beyond, Phillippe took on a range of parts in films such as &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot; (2000), &quot;Antitrust&quot; (2001), &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001), &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; (2002), &quot;The I Inside&quot; (2003), &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2006), &quot;Breach&quot; (2007), &quot;Stop-Loss&quot; (2008), &quot;MacGruber&quot; (2010), &quot;The Bang Bang Club&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot; (2011).

Outside of film, Phillippe appeared in the lead role of Bob Lee Swagger on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Shooter&quot; (2016–2018) and reprised his portrayal of Dixon Piper in the Peacock adaptation of &quot;MacGruber&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Phillippe was born in New Castle, Delaware. His mother, Susan, ran a day care center in the family&#x27;s house; his father, Richard Phillippe, was a chemist. Phillippe has three sisters, and is of part French descent. He graduated from Barbizon in Wilmington, Delaware.

Phillippe earned a black belt in Tae Kwon Do in his youth.

==Career==

===Early career (1990–1996)===
Phillippe&#x27;s acting career began after being signed to Cathy Parker Management in Voorhees, New Jersey. Shortly after, he made an appearance in the ABC daytime drama &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. His character, Billy Douglas, whom he played from 1992 to 1993, was the first gay teenager on a daytime soap opera. After leaving the show, Phillippe moved to Los Angeles, where he appeared in a number of small parts in various television series including &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Due South&quot;, the TV miniseries &quot;The Secrets of Lake Success&quot;, and movies, including the 1995 film &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; and the 1996 film &quot;White Squall&quot;.

===Rise to prominence (1997–2001)===
He was cast in the 1997 horror film, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. The film was a success and led to Phillippe gaining wider renown and being cast in a few more high-profile films, including &quot;54&quot; and &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; in 1998. In 1999, he starred in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, a modern retelling of the Choderlos de Laclos novel &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, which also starred Phillippe&#x27;s future wife, Reese Witherspoon. It was a success among its intended teenage audience, cementing Phillippe&#x27;s ability to play characters that require sex appeal. Phillippe can also be seen in the Marcy Playground music video &quot;Comin&#x27; Up From Behind&quot;, which appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. In the years following, he appeared in the crime drama &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot;, starred as a famed software engineer in the thriller &quot;Antitrust&quot;, and co-starred in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, which was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture.

===Critical success and later work (2002–2011)===
Phillippe had supporting parts in the films &quot;Igby Goes Down&quot; (2002) and &quot;Crash&quot; (2005), which won the Best Picture Oscar. His 2003 film &quot;The I Inside&quot; premiered on cable.
In 2006, Phillippe played real-life Navy corpsman John Bradley in the war film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood and following the journey of the United States Marines who lifted the flag at the Battle of Iwo Jima. Phillippe has said that the film was the &quot;best experience&quot; of his career because of its &quot;personal meaning&quot; to him and that he would have &quot;given [his] life&quot; to fight in World War II, noting that both of his grandfathers fought in the war. His performance was positively received by film critic Richard Roeper, who thought it was Phillippe&#x27;s best to date. Phillippe&#x27;s next role was in the thriller &quot;Breach&quot;, in which he played FBI investigator Eric O&#x27;Neill opposite Chris Cooper. He has since commented that he believes Cooper to be &quot;the best actor America has to offer&quot;. He then starred in &quot;Chaos&quot;, in which he plays a police officer; &quot;Five Fingers&quot;, a drama set in Morocco; Kimberly Peirce&#x27;s Iraq war film &quot;Stop-Loss&quot;; and the futuristic &quot;Franklyn&quot;. 

Next up for Phillippe was a rare comedic role as Lt. Dixon Piper in &quot;MacGruber&quot;, a film based on the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL) skit of the same name. It was released in the U.S. and Canada on May 21, 2010. As part of the film&#x27;s promotion, Phillippe made his SNL hosting debut on April 17, 2010. Two days later, on April 19, 2010, Phillippe co-hosted WWE Raw, also in support of &quot;MacGruber&quot;. That same year, Phillippe starred in the Canadian and South African production &quot;The Bang-Bang Club&quot;, which tells the real-life story of the Bang-Bang Club, four South African photographers whose images documented the bloody end of apartheid. Phillippe stars as Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Greg Marinovich. Filming for the movie took place in South Africa beginning in March 2009. Phillippe described the filming process as &quot;really run-and-gun. There were no comforts, and I actually appreciate that.&quot; He noted that the experience affected him, explaining that &quot;we were shooting during the day in Soweto, and it was an endless procession of funerals — death is so common. Kids there have no quality of life. It has made me want to get more involved in Africa-based charities.&quot; An early cut of the film was shown at Cannes Film Festival in May 2009, with the final version shown at Cannes in May 2010. The film officially premiered in September 2010 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. The U.S. rights to the movie were picked up by Tribeca Film, which premiered the movie at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival and opened it in limited release on April 22, 2011.

In mid-2010, Phillippe began filming the adaptation of popular crime novel &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, taking on the role of Louis Roulet, a wealthy Los Angeles playboy accused of a crime for which his culpability is unclear. The movie opened on March 18, 2011, and was generally well received by critics, scoring 82% on Rotten Tomatoes as of late March 2011. Phillippe filmed his next project, the heist action film &quot;Setup&quot;, in December 2010 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The movie focuses on a group of young men from Detroit whose attempt at a diamond heist goes awry and brings them into conflict with a mob boss. The movie had a straight-to-DVD release on September 20, 2011. Phillippe next filmed the dramatic dark comedy &quot;Revenge for Jolly!&quot; in mid-2011. The movie, which tells the story of a man set on finding his dog&#x27;s murderer, premiered at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival. Phillippe subsequently began work on another movie, &quot;Straight A&#x27;s&quot;, in August 2011. Filmed in Shreveport, Louisiana, it stars Phillippe as a man who has been in and out of rehab for years and is now haunted by his mother&#x27;s ghost.

===Return to television and focus on directing and producing (2012–present)===
Starting in November 2011, Phillippe spent several months filming a 10-episode arc on the fifth and final season of the critically acclaimed TV show &quot;Damages&quot;. Playing Channing McClaren, a Julian Assange–like character, it was his first regular TV role since his breakout part on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. The season aired from July to September 2012. In 2012, Phillippe focused on his directorial debut, &quot;Catch Hell&quot;, an indie thriller in which Phillippe stars as a fading film actor who must devise a creative escape after he is kidnapped and tortured while making a movie in Shreveport, Louisiana. In addition to directing, co-producing, and starring in the film, Phillippe co-wrote the script with Joe Gossett. Phillippe has said that the film is based partly on his and his friends&#x27;s life experiences (including the filming of &quot;Straight A&#x27;s&quot; in Shreveport in 2011) but is partly meant to be &quot;a fun scary movie in the vein of &quot;Misery&quot;&quot;. Filming took place on location in Shreveport in the fourth quarter of 2012. The movie was released on October 10, 2014.

In October 2013, Phillippe began filming the action thriller &quot;Reclaim&quot; in Puerto Rico. The movie features Phillippe as an American man who travels to Puerto Rico with his wife to adopt an orphan from Haiti. After a confrontation with a local, the child vanishes. &quot;Reclaim&quot; was released on September 19, 2014. In May 2014, ABC picked up the pilot for &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;, which was shot in Charlotte, North Carolina, in early 2014. The 10-episode mystery series debuted on March 1, 2015, as a midseason entry during the 2014–15 U.S. television season. It is based on the Australian series of the same name, with Phillippe playing a family man who becomes a prime murder suspect after he discovers the body of a child. Phillippe was also attached to a number of possible future film roles, including &quot;Chronicle&quot;, a film that was to have been directed by Jay Alaimo that would have seen him in a story &quot;about two childhood friends who reunite to launch the biggest marijuana dealership in New York City&quot;.

Phillippe, Breckin Meyer, Seth Green, and David E. Siegal run a production company called Lucid Films. In 2010, Phillippe and Meyer began &quot;getting a show going for Showtime&quot;, serving as executive producers. The comedy, &quot;Heavy and Rolling&quot;, tells the story of a Manhattan towncar driver who assumes different identities as he moves towards madness. Phillippe also served as executive producer and narrator on &quot;Isolated&quot;, a documentary that follows five surfers as they travel to remote New Guinea in search of untouched waves. The documentary premiered in January 2013 at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

In 2015, Phillippe was cast in the lead role of Bob Lee Swagger on the USA Network thriller drama series &quot;Shooter&quot;, which premiered in November 2016. In February 2020, Phillippe was announced in the role of Cody Hoyt in the ABC crime drama series &quot;Big Sky&quot;, which was created by David E. Kelley. In 2021, Phillipe starred in the movie &quot;One Shot&quot;, a British action thriller film directed by James Nunn.

== Personal life ==
In 1997, Phillippe met actress Reese Witherspoon at a party for her 21st birthday. The following year, the pair starred together in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;. Phillippe and Witherspoon, who was six months pregnant, married on June 5, 1999, in a small ceremony at the Old Wide Awake Plantation near Charleston, South Carolina. Their daughter was born in 1999 and their son was born in 2003. On October 30, 2006, Phillippe and Witherspoon released a statement announcing that they were formally separating. Witherspoon filed for divorce on November 8, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences as the cause. In light of the couple&#x27;s lack of a prenuptial agreement, she requested that the court refuse to grant spousal support to Phillippe and asked for joint legal custody and sole physical custody of the pair&#x27;s two children. Phillippe filed for joint physical custody of the children on May 15, 2007, and did not seek any spousal support. The couple&#x27;s marriage officially ended on October 5, 2007, with final divorce arrangements settled on June 13, 2008, according to court documents. Phillippe and Witherspoon shared joint custody of their children.

Phillippe began dating model and actress Alexis Knapp in May 2010; they ended their relationship in September that same year. After their breakup, Knapp discovered that she was pregnant by Phillippe and gave birth to a daughter in 2011. Phillippe began dating law student Paulina Slagter in 2011. They became engaged in 2015 but ended their relationship in 2016. In March 2017, Slagter filed a harassment report with the LAPD after Phillippe had been harassing her via text messages. In September 2017, Elsie Hewitt, an ex-girlfriend of Phillippe, filed a lawsuit against him for allegedly punching her, kicking her, and throwing her down stairs. Hewitt was granted an Emergency Protective Order by the LAPD stating Phillippe could not come within of her. In October 2019, the case was settled.

<text>Truro (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Trùru&quot;) is a town in central Nova Scotia, Canada. Truro is the shire town of Colchester County and is located on the south side of the Salmon River floodplain, close to the river&#x27;s mouth at the eastern end of Cobequid Bay.

==History==

The area has been home to the Mi&#x27;kmaq people for several centuries. The Mi&#x27;kmaq name for the Truro area, &quot;Wagobagitik&quot; means &quot;end of the water&#x27;s flow&quot;. Mi&#x27;kmaq people continue to live in the area at the Millbrook and Truro reserves of the Millbrook – We’kopekwitk band.

Acadian settlers came to this area in the early 1700s. The Mi&#x27;kmaq name for the Truro area was shortened by the settlers to &quot;Cobequid&quot;, and the bay to the west of the town is still named Cobequid Bay. By 1727, the settlers had established a small village near the present downtown site of Truro known as &quot;Vil Bois Brule&quot; (Village in the burnt wood). Many Acadians in this region left in the Acadian Exodus which preceded the Expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. In 1761, the British settled the area with Presbyterians of predominantly Ulster Scottish origin who came from Ireland via New England. They named the new settlement after the city of Truro in Cornwall, United Kingdom.

Originally a small farming community, the construction of the Nova Scotia Railway between Halifax, and Pictou in 1858 caused the municipality to experience a fast rate of growth which increased even more when the railway connected to central Canada in 1872 and became the Intercolonial Railway. The Intercolonial, which later became the Canadian National Railway built a large roundhouse and rail yard in Truro. Further rail links to Cape Breton and to the Annapolis Valley through the Dominion Atlantic Railway in 1905 increased the town&#x27;s importance as a transportation hub for Nova Scotia. The railway also attracted industries such as the Truro Woolen Mills in 1870 (which later became Stanfield&#x27;s) and provincial institutions like the provincial Normal School (later the Nova Scotia Teachers College) and the Nova Scotia Agricultural College. The town officially incorporated in 1875. Many figures from the town&#x27;s past were featured in over 40 tree sculptures which were carved in tree trunks after Truro lost most of its Elm trees to Dutch Elm Disease in the 1990s. As of 2018, most of these sculptures were suffering from severe deterioration and were taken down. The history of the town and surrounding county is preserved at the Colchester Historical Museum (c.1900-1901), which is designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act.

=== History ===
Three areas of Truro contain many African Nova Scotian residents. The residents of Upper/Lower Ford Street (“the Marsh”) are descendants of Black Loyalists and Black Refugees. Young Street (“the Hill”) has people from a number of different cultural and ethnic diversities. Black Loyalist descendants make up the vast majority of people in the third area, West Prince Street (“the Island”). Many of Truro&#x27;s black community has roots in the historically important Black Nova Scotian settlements of Guysborough County. Zion United Baptist Church, first founded in 1896 on Prince Street, has long been the spiritual heart of the community.

Truro is also the birthplace of world-renowned contralto, Portia White (1911–1968). To support herself while taking music lessons at the Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts she taught school in Africville and Lucasville. Her national debut occurred in 1941 at the Eaton Auditorium in Toronto, and her international debut came at the Town Hall in New York in 1944. She gave a Command Performance for Queen Elizabeth II at the opening of Confederation Centre in Charlottetown in 1964. A monument commemorating Portia White stands on the grounds of the Zion United Baptist Church.

A number of other prominent Black Canadians have roots in the town. One of Canada&#x27;s most well known civil rights leader, Burnley Allan &quot;Rocky&quot; Jones, was raised in &quot;the Marsh&quot; neighbourhood of Truro. Art Dorrington, the first black hockey player to sign an NHL contract was raised in &quot;the Island&quot;.

== Infrastructure and attractions ==
Truro is known as the Hub of Nova Scotia as it is located at the junction between the Canadian National Railway, running between Halifax and Montreal, and the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway, running between Truro and Port Hawkesbury. Until the 1980s, Truro also hosted a junction between the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s former Dominion Atlantic Railway line running through Windsor and down the Annapolis Valley to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.
An important highway interchange is located just north of Truro in the rural community of Onslow where Highway 102 ends at Highway 104 - both four lane expressways. Secondary roads Trunk 2 and Trunk 4 intersect in the town. Important tertiary roads Route 236 and Route 311 end in the nearby communities of Lower Truro and Onslow respectively. Some of these roads also form part of the Glooscap Trail which is a scenic drive for tourists. Truro railway station is served by Via Rail&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&quot; line.

Nova Scotia Power has several transmission line corridors in or near Truro; additionally Bell Aliant, EastLink and 360networks route most of the major telephone and data communications lines in the province through the town.

Six large sections of the Berlin Wall are located along the Cobequid Trail, on the Agricultural Campus of Dalhousie University.

<doc id="247468" wikidata="Q44152" url="?curid=247468" title="Rey Mysterio">
<text>Óscar Gutiérrez Rubio (born December 11, 1974), better known by his ring name Rey Mysterio, is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand. Widely regarded as one of the greatest cruiserweight wrestlers of all time, Mysterio is an inductee of the AAA Hall of Fame, &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame, and WWE Hall of Fame.

The nephew and trainee of Rey Misterio, Mysterio began wrestling on the independent circuit in 1989 at the age of 14 before signing with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración in 1992. After brief stints with Extreme Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Association, and Wrestle Association R, Mysterio signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996. In WCW, Mysterio helped popularize &quot;lucha libre&quot; in the United States, which led to the rise of cruiserweight wrestling divisions, winning the WCW Cruiserweight Championship five times; the WCW World Tag Team Championship three times; and the WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship once. He lost his mask in a &quot;Lucha de Apuestas&quot; against Kevin Nash, working unmasked until 2002.

Following the closure of WCW in 2001, Mysterio wrestled for promotions including Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, the World Wrestling Council, and the X Wrestling Federation before joining World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002, where he resumed wearing a mask. He stayed with WWE until 2015, winning the World Heavyweight Championship twice; the WWE Championship once; the WWE Cruiserweight Championship three times; the WWE Intercontinental Championship twice; the WWE United States Championship three times, and the WWE Tag Team Championship four times, as well as winning the 2006 Royal Rumble.

Mysterio departed WWE in 2015, going on to appear in promotions including New Japan Pro-Wrestling, Lucha Underground, and Asistencia Asesoría y Administración. He returned to WWE in 2018, where he was joined by his son Dominik.

== Early life ==
Óscar Gutiérrez was born on December 11, 1974, in Chula Vista, California, a suburb of San Diego County. His parents are Mexican nationals Maria del Rosario and Roberto Gutierrez (1948–2024), both from very poor, uneducated backgrounds; Maria was a house cleaner and Roberto was a factory worker. Gutiérrez spent his childhood crossing the border from Tijuana to San Diego each day for school. Gutiérrez dropped out of high school with his parents&#x27; approval. He has three brothers.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1989–1992) ===
Gutiérrez made his debut in Mexico on April 30, 1989, when he was 14 years old. He was trained by his uncle Rey Misterio and wrestled early on in Mexico, where he learned the &quot;Lucha Libre&quot; high flying style that has been his trademark. He had ring names such as &quot;La Lagartija Verde (The Green Lizard)&quot; and &quot;Colibrí (Hummingbird)&quot; before his uncle gave him the name of Rey Misterio Jr. In 1991, while wrestling in Mexico as Colibrí, Mysterio was named &quot;Most Improved Wrestler&quot;. 

=== Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (1992–1996) ===
In Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), Mysterio feuded with Juventud Guerrera. Mysterio&#x27;s uncle Misterio Sr. also took on Guerrera in a tag match: Misterio Sr. and Mysterio Jr. faced Guerrera and his father Fuerza Guerrera.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995–1996) ===
Mysterio signed with Paul Heyman&#x27;s Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1995. He debuted on September 16, 1995, at Gangstas Paradise, defeating Psicosis, who was also making his ECW debut. A feud between the two began, which included a two out of three falls match at South Philly Jam and a Mexican Death match at November to Remember 1995. Mysterio went on to have a series of matches with ECW newcomer Juventud Guerrera during early 1996. He wrestled his final bout for ECW at Big Ass Extreme Bash in March 1996, defeating Guerrera.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1996–2001) ===
==== Cruiserweight division (1996–1998) ====
Mysterio made his World Championship Wrestling (WCW) debut on June 16, 1996, at The Great American Bash, challenging Dean Malenko for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship in a losing effort. At Bash at the Beach on July 7, he defeated Psicosis in a #1 contender&#x27;s match to earn another opportunity at the Cruiserweight Championship, which he won for the first time by defeating Malenko the next night on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. He successfully defended the title against Ultimate Dragon at Hog Wild on August 10, Malenko at Clash of the Champions XXXIII five days later, and Super Caló at Fall Brawl on September 15. On October 27, at Halloween Havoc, he lost the title back to Malenko. Mysterio challenged Ultimate Dragon for the J-Crown Championship in a losing effort at World War 3 on November 24.

On February 23, 1997, he faced Prince Iaukea for the WCW World Television Championship at SuperBrawl VII, but lost after being attacked by Lord Steven Regal. Mysterio also lost a title rematch at Uncensored on March 16. Soon after, Mysterio began a feud with the New World Order (nWo), culminating when he lost a Mexican Death match to nWo member Konnan at Road Wild on August 9. Mysterio was then involved in a feud with his real-life friend and Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero, whom he defeated in a Title vs. Mask match at Halloween Havoc on October 26 to win the Cruiserweight Championship for the second time. On the November 10 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he lost the title back to Guerrero, as well as in a rematch at World War 3 on November 23. On the January 15, 1998, episode of &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;, Mysterio defeated Juventud to win his third Cruiserweight Championship, but lost it nine days later to Chris Jericho at Souled Out. After the match, Jericho continued the beating by using a toolbox he found at ringside. This storyline was used to cover Mysterio&#x27;s need for a knee operation that kept him out of the ring for six months. At Bash at the Beach on July 12, Mysterio returned and defeated Jericho for his fourth Cruiserweight championship. The next night, however, the result was overturned and the belt returned to Jericho due to Dean Malenko interfering.

Later that year, Eddie Guerrero formed a Mexican stable known as the Latino World Order (LWO) (a spin off of New World Order) that included nearly every luchador in the promotion. Mysterio continually refused to join and feuded with Guerrero and the LWO members, including winning a match against longtime rival and LWO member Psicosis in a match at Road Wild on August 8. He was forced to join the group after losing a match to Eddie Guerrero. Mysterio&#x27;s on-and-off tag team partner Billy Kidman joined him during the feud with LWO, wrestling against the LWO despite Mysterio being a part of the group. Mysterio faced Kidman for the Cruiserweight Championship at Starrcade on December 27, but was unsuccessful in a triangle match also involving Juventud. On January 17, 1999, at Souled Out, Mysterio failed to win the title from Kidman in a four-way match that also included Psicosis and Juventud.

==== Giant Killer; unmasking (1998–1999) ====
After the two factions of nWo reformed, they demanded that the LWO disband. Mysterio refused to take off his LWO colors and was attacked by the nWo as a result. This led to a match at SuperBrawl IX on February 21, where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a &quot;Hair vs. Mask match&quot; against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked:

Following SuperBrawl, Mysterio became a &quot;giant killer&quot; by defeating large opponents such as Kevin Nash, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton. At Uncensored on March 14, he lost to Nash after interference from Lex Luger. The next night, on the March 15 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he defeated Billy Kidman to win his fourth Cruiserweight Championship. On the March 22 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Mysterio got his first shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Ric Flair when the names of (allegedly) nearly everyone in the company were put into a hat and a lottery was held. El Dandy was the lottery winner, but he was injured, and Mysterio took the shot instead. The match ended with a disqualification win for Flair, even though Arn Anderson&#x27;s interference on Flair&#x27;s behalf should have theoretically disqualified Flair. The following week, Mysterio and Kidman defeated Flair&#x27;s Four Horsemen stablemates Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship, making Mysterio a double champion. Mysterio successfully defended his Cruiserweight Championship against his tag team partner Kidman at Spring Stampede on April 11 before losing the title on the April 19 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; to Psicosis in a fatal four-way match that also involved Juventud Guerrera and Blitzkrieg. On the following episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he defeated Psicosis to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship. At Slamboree on May 9, Mysterio and Kidman lost the World Tag Team titles to Raven and Perry Saturn in a triangle match, also involving former champions Benoit and Malenko.

==== No Limit Soldiers; Filthy Animals (1999–2001) ====
In mid-1999, Mysterio and Konnan joined Master P&#x27;s No Limit Soldiers and feuded with the West Texas Rednecks. At The Great American Bash on June 13, they defeated Rednecks members Curt Hennig and Bobby Duncum Jr., and at Bash at the Beach on July 11, won a four-on-four elimination tag team match against them. After Master P&#x27;s departure from WCW, Mysterio formed a stable with Eddie Guerrero and Billy Kidman known as the Filthy Animals, turning heel for the first and only time in his career. The Filthy Animals defeated Dead Pool in six-man tag team matches at Road Wild on August 14 and Fall Brawl on September 12. On the August 19 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, Mysterio lost the cruiserweight title to Lenny Lane.

On the October 18 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Mysterio and Konnan defeated Harlem Heat to win the World Tag Team Championship, however, Mysterio was injured during the match and was sidelined. Kidman substituted for Mysterio and teamed with Konnan during their title defense against Harlem Heat and the First Family at Halloween Havoc six days later, where the Filthy Animals lost the titles back to Harlem Heat. Mysterio returned in early 2000 and remained a steady performer, eventually joining the New Blood faction, opposing the Millionaire&#x27;s Club. On the August 14 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Mysterio and Juventud defeated The Great Muta and Vampiro to win the World Tag Team Championship. They were stripped of the title after Ernest Miller pinned Disco Inferno with the stipulation that if he pinned Disco, Mysterio and Guerrera would be stripped of the title. At Fall Brawl on September 17, the Filthy Animals fought The Natural Born Thrillers to a no contest in an elimination tag team match. Mysterio reformed his tag team with Kidman and challenged for the World Tag Team Championship in a triangle match at Halloween Havoc on October 29, facing the champions Natural Born Thrillers and The Boogie Knights in a losing effort.

At Millennium Final on November 16, Mysterio and Kidman lost to KroniK, but avenged their loss at Mayhem ten days later against KroniK and Alex Wright in a handicap match. At Starrcade on December 17, The Filthy Animals lost to The Harris Brothers and Jeff Jarrett in a Bunkhouse Brawl. After this, the Filthy Animals starting feuding with Team Canada, to whom they lost in a Penalty Box match at Sin on January 14, 2001. At SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, Mysterio unsuccessfully challenged Chavo Guerrero Jr. for the Cruiserweight Championship. Kidman and Mysterio participated in a cruiserweight tag team tournament for the newly created WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship and advanced to the final round, where they lost to Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo at Greed on March 18. On the final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; on March 26, they defeated Skipper and Romeo in a rematch to win the Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship before WCW was sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

=== Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2001) ===
After WCW closed down, Mysterio started wrestling independently in Mexico. He made his first ever Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre appearance, debuting in an eight-man tag team match. Mysterio wrestled a total of 10 matches in CMLL before returning to the United States.

=== Independent circuit and Puerto Rico (2002) ===
Upon his return to the US, he worked in IWA Mid-South, the Xcitement Wrestling Federation and the Heartland Wrestling Association, with the likes of Eddie Guerrero and CM Punk. Mysterio traveled to Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council and defeated Eddie Colon for the WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship on January 6, 2002, holding the belt until losing it back to Colon on April 6.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2002–2015) ===
==== Championship reigns (2002–2004) ====
In June 2002, Mysterio signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and promos that hyped his debut began airing. The &quot;Jr.&quot; was dropped from his name and he was billed simply as Rey Mysterio.

Mysterio, with his mask, made his WWE debut on the July 25, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as a face, defeating Chavo Guerrero. His first feud was with Kurt Angle, culminating in a match at SummerSlam on August 25, which Angle won after forcing Mysterio to submit to the ankle lock. He later formed a tag team with Edge, participating in a tournament for the newly created and SmackDown!-exclusive WWE Tag Team Championship. They lost to Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit in the finals of the tournament at No Mercy on October 20; the match was voted Match of the Year by the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;.

At No Mercy on October 3, they failed to win the titles from Suzuki and Duprée, but won them in a rematch on the December 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. They successfully defended the titles against Suzuki and Duprée at Armageddon on December 12, before losing the titles to the Basham Brothers on the January 13, 2005, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after Van Dam was injured.

On February 20, Mysterio teamed up with Eddie Guerrero, winning the WWE Tag Team Championship back from the Basham Brothers at No Way Out. In a departure from traditional booking, Mysterio and Guerrero did not defend their titles at WrestleMania 21 on April 3, but instead had a match against each other, which Mysterio won. On the April 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio and Guerrero lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro). The following week, Guerrero abandoned Mysterio, whom he had considered &quot;his family&quot; earlier in the show, during their rematch for the titles, costing them the match. After a street fight against Chavo on the May 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Eddie came out and suplexed Mysterio on the steel steps, displaying Eddie&#x27;s increasing frustration with being unable to defeat Mysterio.

At Judgment Day on May 22, Mysterio defeated Guerrero by disqualification after Guerrero attacked him with a steel chair. On June 12, in the midst of their feud, Mysterio faced and defeated long-time rival Psicosis for the first time in nearly five years at ECW One Night Stand. Guerrero then threatened to reveal a secret he and Mysterio shared involving Mysterio&#x27;s real life son Dominik, unless Mysterio deferred to Guerrero&#x27;s authority. At The Great American Bash on July 24, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a match with a stipulation that if Guerrero lost, he would not tell the secret. Despite this, Guerrero revealed the secret on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, that he was Dominik&#x27;s biological father. Guerrero said he knew Mysterio was having trouble starting his own family, so Guerrero left Dominik as a baby with Mysterio and his wife Angie to raise. He threatened to take custody of Dominik, drawing up custody papers and having his lawyer present them to Mysterio. At SummerSlam on August 21, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match for the custody of Dominik. On the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio lost to Guerrero in a steel cage match, ending their feud.

On November 13, 2005, Eddie Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in Minneapolis, Minnesota. That same day, at a WWE &quot;Super Show&quot; where &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; were both taped, Mysterio gave an emotional speech about Guerrero, and in a show of respect, removed his mask (though he put his head down, so his face could not be seen). Mysterio went on to defeat Shawn Michaels in an interbrand match later that night. After the match, Michaels and Mysterio hugged in the ring and Mysterio pointed up to the sky, crying, in memory of Guerrero.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2005–2007) ====
Mysterio participated in the main event of Survivor Series on November 27, as part of Team SmackDown! along with Randy Orton, Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), defeating Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Kane, Big Show, Carlito, and Chris Masters). Mysterio faced Big Show, who he eliminated at Survivor Series, in a match billed as &quot;David vs. Goliath&quot; in a &quot;SmackDown!&quot; special show on November 29, which ended as a &quot;no contest&quot; after interference from Show&#x27;s tag team partner, Kane. Mysterio continued to feud with Raw&#x27;s World Tag Team Champions, and found a tag team partner in World Heavyweight Champion Batista. They were booked to face Raw&#x27;s Kane and Big Show in a tag team match at Armageddon on December 18. Two days before the event, Batista and Mysterio defeated MNM on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to win the WWE Tag Team Championship in a match they both dedicated to Guerrero. Mysterio and Batista&#x27;s match with Big Show and Kane was then billed as &quot;Champions vs. Champions&quot;, which they lost. On the December 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, MNM invoked their rematch clause, defeating Batista and Mysterio after interference from Mark Henry to regain the WWE Tag Team Championship. The following week, Mysterio and Batista lost their rematch for the titles in a steel cage match after interference by Henry.

On January 29, 2006, Mysterio was the second entrant in the Royal Rumble match, setting a record by lasting 62 minutes, winning the match, and earning a world title shot by last eliminating Orton. Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No Way Out. Over the following weeks, Orton made disparaging remarks about Eddie Guerrero, which many people, including Orton, felt the comments were unwarranted and distasteful in the wake of Guerrero&#x27;s death. Orton won at No Way Out on February 19, earning Mysterio&#x27;s title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. However, General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania title match, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. At WrestleMania on April 2, Mysterio pinned Orton to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio – billed as an &quot;underdog champion&quot;, made his first successful World Heavyweight title defense against Orton. Mysterio retained the title again during a WrestleMania rematch on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; against Angle three weeks later.

Mysterio quickly moved into a feud with the United States Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), who stated he deserved the World Heavyweight title. This feud saw him face off against three opponents chosen by JBL in the three weeks leading up to their title match at Judgment Day. Mysterio was defeated by Mark Henry and The Great Khali in separate non-title matches before wrestling Kane to a &quot;no contest&quot;. On May 21, Mysterio retained his title against JBL at Judgment Day. The feud intensified when JBL lost the United States Championship to Bobby Lashley five days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after being tricked by Mysterio to take on all comers like Mysterio himself had. JBL vowed that if he did not win his rematch against Mysterio, he would quit SmackDown!. In their main event match, Mysterio retained the World Heavyweight Championship, causing JBL to leave SmackDown!, until ECW One Night Stand on June 11, when he announced his return as a color commentator. Mysterio was booked to defend against ECW wrestler Sabu at ECW One Night Stand. In the weeks leading up to his title defense, Mysterio defeated Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms in a Champion vs. Champion match, and lost to Rob Van Dam at WWE vs. ECW Head-to-Head on June 7. At ECW One Night Stand, Mysterio retained the title, after he and Sabu were ruled unable to continue following a triple jump DDT through a table by Sabu. Mysterio then retained his title in a match against Mark Henry, winning by disqualification after Chavo Guerrero handed Henry a chair and Mysterio acted as if he was hit, a tactic for which Eddie Guerrero was known.

Mysterio began a feud with King Booker, who won a battle royal to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. King Booker attacked Mysterio from behind backstage with the help of King Booker&#x27;s wife Queen Sharmell. The next week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio gained revenge by attacking King Booker and his &quot;court&quot;. On July 23, at The Great American Bash, Mysterio lost the World Heavyweight Championship to King Booker after Chavo interfered in the match and turned on Mysterio, hitting him with a steel chair. Guerrero would also cost Mysterio his rematch the following week. At SummerSlam on August 20, Mysterio lost to Guerrero after Vickie Guerrero tried to stop both men from fighting, but accidentally knocked Mysterio off the top turnbuckle. Vickie then turned on Mysterio by hitting him in the back with a steel chair and gave him an injury, thus, siding with Guerrero. On October 8, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a Falls Count Anywhere match at No Mercy. Subsequently, Guerrero challenged Mysterio to an &quot;I quit&quot; match for the October 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, which Mysterio lost. During the match, Guerrero injured Mysterio&#x27;s knee, which was used to write Mysterio out of the storyline for a while to get knee surgery.

Mysterio made his in-ring return at SummerSlam on August 26, 2007, defeating Guerrero, after he obsessed over Mysterio&#x27;s return as well as wanting to injure Mysterio again. On the August 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio defeated Batista and Finlay in a &quot;Championship Competition&quot; to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Unforgiven, held by The Great Khali. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match after hitting Guerrero&#x27;s knee with a steel chair repeatedly in a similar manner to which Mysterio had been put out of action, ending the feud. After the match, Batista saved Mysterio from an attack by Khali, making the match at Unforgiven a triple threat match. At the event on September 16, Mysterio failed to win the title, which was won by Batista.

At WrestleMania Backlash on May 16, they defeated Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode to win the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship, becoming the first ever father-son tag team champions in WWE history. On the June 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the Mysterios retained their titles against The Usos, albeit with controversy as the referee failed to notice Jimmy&#x27;s shoulder was lifted. After Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville granted a rematch later that night, the Mysterios again retained their titles after Roman Reigns interfered and attacked them, causing a disqualification. On the June 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Mysterio lost to Reigns in a Hell in a Cell match. At the Money in the Bank pre-show on July 18, the Mysterios lost the titles to the Usos, ending their reign at 63 days. They failed to regain the titles at SummerSlam on August 21.

As part of the 2021 Draft, both Rey and Dominik were drafted to the Raw brand. Rey, along with Dominik, were then involved in a feud with The Miz, whom Rey defeated at the Elimination Chamber pre-show on February 19. The feud grew to involve social media star Logan Paul, culminating in a tag team match between the Mysterios and Miz and Paul on Night 1 of WrestleMania 38 on April 2, which the Mysterios lost.

Over the following weeks, The Mysterios began a feud with The Judgment Day (Finn Balor, Damian Priest, and Rhea Ripley), who repeatedly attempted to have Dominik join the stable. At SummerSlam on July 30, the Mysterios defeated Bálor and Priest after interference from a returning Edge. At Clash at the Castle on September 3, Rey and Edge defeated Bálor and Priest. After the match, Dominik hit Edge with a low blow and hit a clothesline on Rey, thus disbanding the Mysterios. On the October 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, he was transferred to the SmackDown brand, refusing to fight his son. Later that night, he won a fatal four-way match for an Intercontinental Championship match against Gunther, which he lost on the November 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

==== Latino World Order (2023–present) ====

At the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2023, Rey was scheduled to enter the Royal Rumble match at No. 17, but was unable to compete due to presumably being attacked either solely by Dominik, who entered the match at No. 18 or the entire The Judgment Day.

On March 10, WWE announced that Mysterio would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Class of 2023. After weeks of continuous torment by Dominik, on the March 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Rey attacked Dominik after he disrespected his mother and sister, accepting his challenge for a match at WrestleMania 39. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Rey would reform the Latino World Order by gifting LWO shirts to Legado Del Fantasma (Santos Escobar, Zelina Vega, Joaquin Wilde, and Cruz Del Toro), as the group had aided Mysterio against The Judgment Day for several weeks prior. At Night 1 of WrestleMania 39 on April 1, Rey defeated Dominik with help from Bad Bunny.

In July, Mysterio competed in the United States Title Invitational Tournament, where he was defeated by LWO stablemate Escobar in the finals via referee stoppage, after suffering from whiplash. On the August 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after Escobar was rendered unable to compete in his title match due to an attack from the champion, Austin Theory, Mysterio took Escobar&#x27;s place and defeated Theory to capture his third United States Championship. At Payback on September 2, he defeated Theory in a rematch to retain the title. On the September 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Mysterio successfully defended the title against Escobar. After the match, they were attacked by The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford). At Fastlane on October 7, Mysterio, Escobar and the returning Carlito defeated Bobby Lashley and The Street Profits in a six-man tag team match. On November 4, at Crown Jewel, Mysterio lost the United States Championship to Logan Paul after Escobar placed brass knuckles in the ring, which Paul used on Mysterio, ending his reign at 85 days.
After a three-month hiatus, Mysterio returned on the March 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, assisting Carlito in winning a street fight against Escobar. Three weeks later, Mysterio lost to Escobar after interference from Dominik. On the March 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Mysterio introduced Dragon Lee as the newest member of the LWO, and Rey and Lee challenged Escobar and Dominik to a tag team match at WrestleMania XL. However, Lee was found attacked backstage the following week, rendering him unable to compete at WrestleMania. Rey was assisted by Andrade to fend off Escobar and Dominik. At Night 1 of WrestleMania XL on April 6, Mysterio and Andrade defeated Escobar and Dominik after interference from Lane Johnson and Jason Kelce. On the April 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after Rey and Lee defeated Los Lotharios (Angel and Berto), Escobar revealed that Carlito had attacked Lee. Carlito then proceeded to attack both Lee and Mysterio after Escobar&#x27;s revelation. As part of the 2024 WWE Draft, Mysterio and the rest of the LWO were drafted to the Raw brand.

== Other media ==
Mysterio has been a subject of several DVDs during his wrestling career, including &quot;Rey Mysterio: 619&quot;, a 2003 documentary of Mysterio&#x27;s career and personal life. WWE also produced &quot;Rey Mysterio: The Biggest Little Man&quot;, a three disc set featuring Mysterio&#x27;s best matches that was released on October 23, 2007. He was also featured on the DVD &quot;Before They Were Wrestling Stars: Rey Mysterio Jr.&quot; in 2007 which featured matches from his time in Mexico. &quot;Rey Mysterio: The Life of a Masked Man&quot; was issued on July 12, 2011. In the UK, Silver Vision released a Mysterio DVD as part of their Best of WWE collection. This featured his matches from SummerSlam 2005, WrestleMania 22, No Mercy 2006, and SummerSlam 2007.

== Personal life ==
Gutiérrez is of Mexican descent. He and his wife, Angie, have two children: a son, Dominik, and a daughter, Aalyah. He has tattoos of his children&#x27;s names on his right and left biceps, tattoos dedicated to his wife, and a tattoo with the initials &quot;EG&quot; for his best friend and fellow wrestler, Eddie Guerrero, who died in 2005. Gutiérrez is part of an extended family of wrestlers, including his son Dominik, uncle Rey Misterio, and his cousins El Hijo de Rey Misterio and Metalika.

On March 19, 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published an article in its continuing series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Gutierrez who was alleged to have obtained nandrolone and stanozolol. WWE subsequently stated that the allegations preceded the Talent Wellness program WWE launched in February 2006. On August 27, 2009, WWE announced that Gutierrez would receive a 30-day suspension due to a violation of the wellness program. Days later, Gutierrez defended himself in a newspaper interview by explaining the drugs as being on a prescription for his knee and arm. While the Wellness Policy allows for prescribed drugs, Gutierrez further contested he had been on a family holiday and subsequently in Europe promoting SummerSlam, giving him only a day to provide the prescription after being notified. On April 26, 2012, WWE suspended Gutierrez for 60 days due to a second violation of their wellness program.

In 2019, Gutiérrez criticized President Donald Trump&#x27;s plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, saying Trump is &quot;definitely not helping&quot; and &quot;a wall is definitely not the solution&quot;; he spent his childhood crossing the border from Mexico to the United States each day for school. 

He is a fervent Catholic, frequently crossing himself before his matches and bearing numerous religious tattoos on his body, most notably a cross on his chest attached to rosaries as well as other crosses and allusions to God.

<doc id="247469" wikidata="Q473575" url="?curid=247469" title="Elvis Stojko">
<text>Elvis Stojko, (born March 22, 1972) is a Canadian figure skater. He was a three-time World champion (1994, 1995, 1997), two-time Olympic silver medallist (1994, 1998), and seven-time Canadian champion (1994, 1996–2000, and 2002).

==Personal life==
Stojko was born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada to a Hungarian mother and Slovenian father and was named after Elvis Presley, of whom his parents were fans. His father arrived in Canada on a boat in 1955 and his mother, Irene (), fled the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Stojko grew up in Richmond Hill, Ontario. There is a hockey arena named after him in Richmond Hill.

Stojko competed in the 2005 WKA Canadian Championships and placed first in the Chinese martial arts division. He has been involved with Ronald McDonald Children&#x27;s Charities in Canada. He settled in Ajijic, Jalisco, Mexico in 2001. On June 20, 2010, he married Mexican figure skater Gladys Orozco in Las Vegas. They resided in Ajijic until June 2014, when they relocated to Toronto. They now live on 140 acres near Bowmanville.

On October 3, 2021, Stojko was revealed to have been named in the Pandora Papers by the CBC.

==Career==
Stojko began skating at the age of four and won his first trophy when he was eleven.

===1990–91 to 1992–93===
At the 1991 World Championships, Stojko became the first person to land a quadruple-double jump combination. He later said he had studied VHS tapes of Kurt Browning, Brian Boitano, Alexander Fadeyev, and Jozef Sabovčík to help him master the quad.

At the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, he finished 7th despite skating a technically strong routine, but a month later he made his first appearance on a major international podium when he placed third at the 1992 World Championships behind winner Viktor Petrenko and Kurt Browning. In 1993 at the World Figure Skating Championships he finished second, once again behind Kurt Browning.

===1993–94 season: Silver at Olympics and first World title===
At the 1994 Canadian Championships in Edmonton, Stojko defeated Kurt Browning in the free skate to win his first national title. At the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway at the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, he skated well enough in the short program to place second, putting him in good position heading into the free skate, after three of the pre-Olympic favourites (Brian Boitano, Viktor Petrenko &amp; Kurt Browning) had disappointing short programs. Stojko had a strong performance in the free skate, despite popping a planned triple axel combination (which he later replaced by doing another triple Axel combination spontaneously) and won the silver medal. Stojko entered the 1994 World Championships in Chiba, Japan, as the favourite and won his first world championship with a performance that included another quadruple jump.

For Stojko&#x27;s free skating program this season, he used music from the soundtrack of &quot;&quot;, the 1993 film biography about Bruce Lee. He was able to demonstrate his interest in karate and tai chi by incorporating movements from his extensive study of the disciplines into the program.

===1994–95 season: Second World title===
Stojko sustained a serious ankle injury during practice for the 1995 Canadian Championships, but was determined to compete anyway. He began his short program but was not able to complete it due to the injury, and was awarded a bye to the 1995 World Championships. His 1995 World Championship skate is regarded as one of his most impressive competitive outings because he completed his full routine despite his still-unhealed injury. Although in second place after the short programme behind American Todd Eldredge, Stojko won the free skate – and his second world championship – with a performance that included a triple lutz-triple toe loop combination in the closing seconds of his programme.

===1995–96 season===
At the 1996 World Championships in Edmonton, Alberta, Stojko fell on his triple axel combo jump, leaving him in seventh place after the short programme. In the free programme he included a quadruple jump combination (the only one in the competition) and moved him all the way up to fourth, just off the podium behind American Rudy Galindo, who won the bronze. His quadruple toe loop–triple toe loop was the first ever performed by a skater in a major competition.

===1996–97 season: Champions Series title===
Stojko won the 1996–97 Champions Series Final (Grand Prix Final) in Hamilton, Ontario, skating to the movie soundtrack of &quot;Dragon Heart&quot;. Two other skaters also landed quad jumps during the free skate (Ilia Kulik and Alexei Urmanov), but not in combination as Stojko did.

At the 1997 World Championships, he again had a strong short programme and placed fourth going into the free. Approximately halfway through the free skate, Alexei Urmanov, leader after the short programme, withdrew from the event with an injury, while Ilia Kulik, in third, had a performance that put him out of contention. Stojko then took the ice and landed his quad-triple combination to earn two perfect scores of 6.0 and another world title.

===1997–98 season: Silver at Nagano Olympics===
Stojko entered the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan as the heavy favorite and was expected to become the first Canadian man to win an Olympic gold medal. He did not disclose to the media that he had suffered a groin injury and was also recovering from a flu that had struck many other athletes during the Games. He was unable to take painkillers due to the possibility of failing his drug test. He later stated in an interview that he was already feeling stiff and sore during the warm-up prior to the long program, and therefore downgraded his planned quadruple toe loop to a triple, likely costing him a chance at gold. Later in the programme, on the landing of a triple axel, Stojko aggravated the injury even further, saying he &quot;felt something snap.&quot; He still managed to successfully complete four more triples after that point, and won the silver medal.

In February 1998, Stojko published a book, &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, about his career.

===1998–99 to 2001–02===
Stojko finished fourth in the 1999 World Championships. After the 1998–99 season, Stojko changed coaches from Doug Leigh to Uschi Keszler and Tim Wood. He won silver at the 2000 World Championships.

Stojko placed eighth at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. He turned professional in 2002.

He appeared as a hockey player Doug, in 2000&#x27;s tv movie Ice Angel.

==2003–present==
Stojko was a commentator for CTV/TSN for the men&#x27;s event at the 2003 World Championships in Washington, D.C. In 2006, he was a celebrity judge on the WE tv series &quot;Skating&#x27;s Next Star&quot;, created and produced by Major League Figure Skating. The show was hosted by Kristi Yamaguchi.

Stojko briefly reinstated as an Olympic-eligible skater and publicly declared his intention to compete in the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy, before changing his mind and resuming his professional skating career. On August 10, 2006, he skated a farewell performance at a gala for the Mariposa skating club, where he trained most of his amateur career. He took a hiatus from active figure skating for several years.

Stojko provided commentary and analysis for Yahoo! Sports during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He wrote an article criticizing the figure skating judging system used during the 2010 Olympics, saying that it did not reward athletes for undertaking quadruple jumps.

Stojko participated in ISF Entertainment&#x27;s acrobatic ice show, &quot;A Rock &amp; Roll Fantasy&quot;, in the July 2010 Calgary Stampede.

Since 2011, Stojko has been racing karts in the Canadian Rotax DD2 Master Class and the SKUSA Mexico Series (S1 and S4 classes).

After Stojko relocated back from Mexico to Canada, he resumed his show skating career. He has participated in the Canadian tour of Stars on Ice since 2016, the show skating events of the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, and Busch Gardens&#x27; Christmas Town events in Williamsburg, Virginia since 2015.

In 2016 Stojko played the role of Mercury in a TV-movie &quot;Ice Girls&quot;.

Stojko played Sam Marshall, an ex-convict, in the Canadian television period drama Murdoch Mysteries, in episode 13 of season 12 &quot;Murdoch and the Undetectable Man&quot; (January 28, 2019)

Stojko was named in the Pandora Papers in 2021.

Since the retirement of Kurt Browning from show skating, Elvis is now the headliner for the Canadian tour of Stars on Ice.

<text>New Glasgow is a town in Pictou County, in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is situated on the banks of the East River of Pictou, which flows into Pictou Harbour, a sub-basin of the Northumberland Strait.

The town&#x27;s population was 9,075 in the 2016 census. New Glasgow is at the centre of the province&#x27;s fourth largest urban area; the population of the New Glasgow census agglomeration in the 2016 census was 34,487. The New Glasgow census agglomeration includes the smaller adjacent towns of Stellarton, Westville, and Trenton as well as adjacent rural areas of the county.

==History==
Scottish immigrants, including those on the ship Hector in 1773, settled the area of the East River of Pictou during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Deacon Thomas Fraser first settled the area at the head of navigation on the East River of Pictou in 1784. The settlement was officially named &quot;New Glasgow&quot;, after Glasgow in Scotland, in 1809, the same year its first trading post was developed.

The discovery of large coal deposits in the East River valley during the early 19th century saw New Glasgow, at the head of navigation, quickly develop into a manufacturing and port community.

In 1829, a horse-drawn tramway was built using standard gauge rails from the settlement of Albion Mines (now Stellarton) to a wharf near New Glasgow. This was the first use of standard gauge rails in what would become Canada. On September 19, 1839, the Albion Railway was opened from Albion Mines to New Glasgow, hauling coal wagons behind steam locomotives such as the Samson along the west bank of the East River of Pictou. This was the second steam-powered railway in what would become Canada, and the first to use iron rails. The railway was extended north to a coal loading pier at Dunbar&#x27;s Point on May 14, 1840.

In 1840, George MacKenzie started the town&#x27;s first shipbuilding company, which eventually built or owned 34 vessels; hundreds of ships would later be built along the East River in New Glasgow. In 1861 the clipper ship &quot;Sebastopol&quot; was built.

In June 1867, the Nova Scotia Railway opened its &quot;Eastern Line&quot; from Truro through New Glasgow to its terminus at the passenger and cargo wharf in Pictou Landing. In 1882 the &quot;Eastern Extension&quot; of the Intercolonial Railway was opened from New Glasgow to Mulgrave on the Strait of Canso, placing New Glasgow on the mainline between Cape Breton Island and the North American rail network.

Economic development in New Glasgow was driven by the steel industry in neighbouring Trenton (site of the first steel manufacturing in Canada), shipbuilding and shipping in Pictou and Pictou Landing, and coal mining in Stellarton and Westville.

After World War I, the famous New York sculptor J. Massey Rhind was commissioned to make the Nova Scotia Highlander soldier cenotaph. In 1946, New Glasgow was the setting for an important civil rights case when Viola Desmond challenged racial segregation of New Glasgow&#x27;s Roseland Theatre. New Glasgow became a service centre for the county during the late 20th century as shopping centres, retail and residential development was spurred by the construction of Highway 104.

===Municipal amalgamation===

Talk of amalgamating the six municipal units in Pictou County has increased in recent years. Among the reasons for this, small towns adjacent to New Glasgow are having a hard time coping financially on their own due to the declining economy. Also, Pictou County has the most politicians per capita in Canada. With the Government of Nova Scotia having already amalgamated Halifax County, Cape Breton County, and Queens County into regional municipalities, Pictou County residents feel it is only a matter of time before that concept is introduced in Pictou County. The two most often suggested scenarios involve amalgamating the entire county (six municipalities) into a single regional municipality, or amalgamating the upper East River towns (New Glasgow, Stellarton, Trenton, Westville) into a single larger town. After several months of public backlash a vote was held and the public spoke against amalgamation, effectively killing any possibility of a future merger.

==Geography==

New Glasgow is located on Nova Scotia&#x27;s north shore, northeast of Halifax, west of the Canso Causeway to Cape Breton and south of the Prince Edward Island ferry at Caribou. The town can be easily accessed from several exits off the Trans Canada Highway. It is in the Atlantic Time Zone, four hours behind UTC.

New Glasgow is divided by the East River (north – south), a tidal estuary with brackish (salt and fresh) water. The three lane George Street bridge is the only vehicle crossing within town limits and is considered the main entrance into the downtown core on the east side of the river. The closest bridges out of town are the Trenton Connector to the north, the Trans Canada Highway to the south and Bridge Avenue (Stellarton) also to the south.

===Climate===

Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies New Glasgow&#x27;s climate as humid continental (Dfb), with rainy and snowy cold winters and warm humid summers. The highest temperature ever recorded in New Glasgow was on 10 August 2001. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 2 February 1961.

===Neighbourhoods===
;South End
The southeastern part of the town is located on the east bank of the East River, immediately north of the unincorporated community of Plymouth and west of the unincorporated community of Priestville. It is largely commercial and centred upon East River Road (signed as Route 348).

The Aberdeen Hospital, New Glasgow business park, New Glasgow Police headquarters, North Nova Education Centre and the Aberdeen Shopping Centre are situated here as well as a residential area.

;Downtown
Located on the east bank of the East River and centred on the George Street Bridge, the downtown core has a central business district along Provost Street and Archimedes Street. Banks, insurance companies, law firms, accounting firms, engineering companies, restaurants and independent retailers are located in historic buildings along these streets.

Formerly industrial, the downtown area along the river has undergone a waterfront revitalization in recent decades as factories and foundries closed and were replaced by a performing arts centre, office buildings and a marina. Currently, only one foundry and several warehouses and a cement plant remain along the rail corridor in this area.

;East Side
The east end is the area east of downtown and is bordered on the east by the unincorporated communities of Frasers Mountain and Linacy. It is largely residential.

;North End
The northeastern part of the town stretches along the east bank of the East River from the downtown to the border with Trenton.

;West Side
The west side of the town is located on the west bank of the East River, consists of a residential area north of George Street through to the unincorporated community of Abercrombie.

The area of the West Side southwest of George Street along Westville Road is a commercial area and includes the Highland Square Mall as well as a district of big box stores. This part of the town borders the town of Stellarton to the south and the Town of Westville to the southwest. Westville Road leads to the town of Westville, about beyond Exit 23 at the Trans Canada Highway.

==Economy==
Major employers in the area include the Aberdeen Hospital, a Michelin tire plant in nearby Granton and the headquarters of Sobeys, a national grocery chain, in nearby Stellarton. However, New Glasgow and Pictou County have suffered the closure of many large employers, including Convergys (~200 jobs), the Northern Pulp Nova Scotia pulp mill in nearby Abercrombie (~300 jobs).

New Glasgow&#x27;s historic downtown core is home to several shops and services. Including restaurants, pubs, cabarets, clothing stores, gift shops, furniture department stores, a marina on the riverfront, government offices and banks. A major revitalization plan was recently announced for the downtown core. A large sum of the funds will be provided by the federal government. Among the projects are a walking bridge that will connect the riverfront marina with the Samson Trail on the west side, improvements to the historic town hall, an updated and possibly expanded library, and beautification of public spaces and storefronts. New Glasgow is the commercial hub of northeastern Nova Scotia.

The Westville Road/Highland Square Mall area has seen significant commercial growth in recent years. A new Walmart opened next to Highland Square in early 2007, replacing the smaller location in the mall. Canadian Tire relocated to Walmart&#x27;s old location in the spring of 2008, making it the second-largest Canadian Tire store in Nova Scotia. Winners opened in Spring 2009, in Canadian Tire&#x27;s former location. Future Shop has built a new store next to the new Canadian Tire, which opened in Spring 2009 but has since closed. SportChek opened a new store inside the mall in Fall 2009. 

About a minute away from the Westville Road commercial district, on the opposite side of the Trans Canada Highway in Stellarton, a new business park is currently being developed. The Holiday Inn Express Hotel Stellarton – New Glasgow was the first confirmed business for the park. It officially opened on July 25, 2008. 

The New Glasgow Farmers Market expanded into an additional, heated facility in November 2015 with the financial assistance of ACOA, The Market is now open every Saturday from 9am until 1pm and boasts more than 70 vendors and more than 1,800 weekly visitors during the peak season from May until October. On July 1, 2017, the New Glasgow Farmers Market will unveil a new community garden project titled The Giving Garden. The project was completed by Market volunteers with the financial grants from the province&#x27;s Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage through the 150 Forward Fund and a Wellness grant from the Pictou County Health Authority.

==Culture==

Museums in New Glasgow include the Carmichael Stewart House Heritage Museum, local Military Museum, and local Sports Hall of Fame.

Glasgow Square Theatre, located on the downtown riverfront, is a 285-seat auditorium that hosts year-round concerts, plays, and other community functions. The theatre can be transformed into an outdoor amphitheatre, one of the few theatres in Canada (if not the only) that can do that. During the summer it hosts celebrations for Canada Day on June 30, the New Glasgow Riverfront Jubilee during the first weekend in August, and the Race on the River Dragon Boat Festival in mid-August.

The New Glasgow Jubilee features local and national musical acts.

The Race on the River features teams representing local companies and organizations paddling along the East River to raise money for local charities.

New Glasgow&#x27;s oldest summer event, The Festival of the Tartans, is a celebration of the town&#x27;s Scottish roots.

==Sports==
In December 1906, the New Glasgow Cubs challenged the Montreal Wanderers for the Stanley Cup. The Cubs were defeated in the two game total goals contest, losing 10–3 on December 27 and 7–2 on December 29.

New Glasgow&#x27;s John Brother MacDonald Stadium (formerly New Glasgow Stadium) used to be home to the Pictou County Crushers of the Maritime Junior Hockey League and the Weeks Major Midgets of the Nova Scotia Major Midget Hockey League. The team now plays at the Pictou County Wellness Centre.

The Crushers were based in Halifax and known as Team Pepsi until 2004 when the Weeks Hockey Organization bought the club and moved it to New Glasgow. After struggling to attract fans in Halifax&#x27;s crowded hockey market, the team is now one of the league&#x27;s top draws.

New Glasgow hosted the 2005 MJAHL All Star game and the 2006 MJAHL Entry Draft. It was announced on December 29, 2006, that New Glasgow would host the 2008 Fred Page Cup, where the Crushers defeated the defending FPC winners from Pembroke, Ontario in the championship game.

The town hosted the Telus Cup (then Air Canada Cup), in 1997 and the 2001 World Under 17 Hockey Championships (co-hosted with Truro).

In 2007, New Glasgow hosted its first Major Junior hockey game (St. John&#x27;s Fog Devils vs P.E.I. Rocket).

On February 9, 2008, New Glasgow was one of six communities across Canada selected to be showcased on CBC Sports&#x27; day-long &quot;Hockey Day in Canada&quot; The New Glasgow segments featured hometown NHL player Jon Sim and the town&#x27;s annual Westside winter carnival.

===Johnny Miles Running Event===

The Johnny Miles Marathon is a set of road races held each year on the third Sunday of June. It was founded in 1975 by local physician Dr. Johnny Miles Williston. Williston named the race after Johnny Miles, the legendary Nova Scotia marathoner for whom he was named. Williston served as co-director of the race until 2000. He died in December 2005. The &quot;Johnny Walk,&quot; which is part of the event activities, is named for both Johnny Miles and Johnny Miles Williston.

On June 20, 2010, the 35th Annual Johnny Miles Marathon and Running Event was held in New Glasgow with a record participation of over 2000 runners. In 2012 the event was named as Run Nova Scotia&#x27;s event of the year. The popular event sold out in both 2012 and 2013.
The event weekend features multiple races including a 5K, 10K, half-marathon and marathon. There is also a 5K kids race and a walking event called the &quot;Johnny Walk.&quot; David MacLennan of Scotsburn, Nova Scotia holds the record for the most wins at the marathon distance, winning his 9th Johnny Miles Marathon in 2012.

==Education==
There are five schools in New Glasgow; including three primary-to-six elementary schools, a junior high school and a high school. The junior high school is made up of grades seven to nine. North Nova Education Centre, which opened its doors in 2003, is made up of grades nine to twelve, and has students from four ‘feeder’ schools, East Pictou Middle School, Trenton Middle School, New Glasgow Junior High School and Thorburn Consolidated.

<doc id="247499" wikidata="Q6143691" url="?curid=247499" title="Picture This (Huey Lewis and the News album)">
<text>Picture This is the second album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released in 1982. The album brought the band their first top-ten hit, &quot;Do You Believe in Love&quot;. It remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart for 35 weeks and peaked at number 7.

== Background ==
The band produced the album themselves along with their manager, Bob Brown. Several outside tunes were included on the album. One of these tunes was &quot;Do You Believe in Love&quot;, written by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. It was released as the album&#x27;s first single and became the band&#x27;s breakthrough hit, reaching the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do&quot;, reached the top 40; while the third single, &quot;Workin&#x27; for a Livin&#x27;&quot;, peaked at number 41.

&quot;Tattoo (Giving It All Up for Love)&quot; is a cover of a Phil Lynott song. Lynott was the singer and bassist for the hard rock group Thin Lizzy, and Huey Lewis had played harmonica on Lynott&#x27;s first two solo albums, as well as Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; album. &quot;Buzz Buzz Buzz&quot; is a cover of a song from 1957 by The Hollywood Flames. &quot;The Only One&quot; was based on a real classmate in Lewis&#x27; junior high school who met an end similar to the person in the song. &quot;He was a very cool kid&quot; said Lewis. &quot;Janey&quot; in the song was also based on the classmate&#x27;s girlfriend, though her name was changed and Lewis does not know of her true fate after her boyfriend&#x27;s death.

<doc id="247533" wikidata="Q180916" url="?curid=247533" title="Vegeta">
<text>( ), fully referred to as , is a fictional character in the Japanese franchise &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; created by Akira Toriyama. Vegeta made his appearance in chapter #204 &quot;Sayonara, Son Goku&quot;, published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on January 7, 1989, seeking the wish-granting Dragon Balls to achieve immortality.

As the first major antagonist of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, Vegeta is the prince of an elite extraterrestrial warrior race known as the Saiyans. As a person, he is naturally blunt, regal, hard-working and is full of his Saiyan pride; he often refers to his heritage and royal status throughout the series, but can also have negative traits such as being extremely haughty along with a destructive temper. He believed that he should be regarded as the strongest fighter in the universe, and becomes obsessed with surpassing Son Goku after losing his battle with the Z fighters. However, after Frieza&#x27;s death, Vegeta unites with the heroes to thwart greater threats to the universe, most notably Cell, Majin Buu, Beerus, Zamasu, Jiren, Broly, Moro and Granolah. Throughout the series, Vegeta&#x27;s role changes from villain to later as one of the heroes, while remaining a key rival to Goku.

Vegeta has been hailed as one of the most iconic characters not only in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, but also in manga and anime history as a whole. He is often cited as one of the most popular examples of rival characters in the industry, due to his character arc and narrative throughout &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;.

==Development==

When creating Vegeta, Toriyama originally intended for him to be a short-lived antagonist and second-tier character, with little influence to &quot;Dragon Ball&#x27;s&quot; story. Toriyama intended for Goku to simply kill him at the climax of their first battle, and portrayed him as simply and one-dimensional as he should have been considering this.

Despite this, the character became more popular than he had expected, and Toriyama became afraid of the backlash of killing him unceremoniously. Thus Toriyama decided to keep Vegeta in the story for longer. Frieza, who was designed as the antagonist of a later story arc whom Vegeta would come into conflict with much later in the story, was used with the secondary aim to create a reasonable &quot;Death&quot; for Vegeta. But he would be revived due to his popularity still.

He explained his surprise at the character&#x27;s popularity in an interview during the release of &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, &quot;I had thought about bringing an end to [his story] as just a villain, but as I was writing, I felt that his villainous [...] warped straightforwardness was unexpectedly interesting. I couldn&#x27;t imagine that a guy with this kind of hairstyle would become popular, and yet he&#x27;d get more votes than Goku in favorite-character polls.&quot;

Toriyama initially harbored a dislike for Vegeta since he was created as a despicable character, but grew to like him as he considered the character&#x27;s personality to be straightforward, therefore easier to write. He also found the character &quot;Extremely helpful to have around&quot;. He stated at one point when he received a lot of fan mail telling him not to kill Vegeta, he purposely did just that. After the release of &quot;Battle of Gods&quot;, Toriyama expressed interest in having Vegeta be the lead in the event of another animated feature, though he insisted this was only his intent and no decision had been made.

Following the trend that names of members of the Saiyan race are puns on vegetables, Vegeta&#x27;s name is a pun of the word &quot;vegetable&quot; itself.

===Voice actors===
In the original Japanese version of the anime and all media, Vegeta is voiced by Ryō Horikawa, with the only exception being &quot;Dragon Ball Daima,&quot; where a mini Vegeta was voiced by Yūdai Mino.

In the Ocean Productions English dub, Vegeta was voiced by Brian Drummond. Drummond returned in the Funimation dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; to voice Vegeta&#x27;s Duplicate.

In Funimation (now Crunchyroll)&#x27;s in house dub, Christopher Sabat has voiced Vegeta in all &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media, including video games. While Sabat continued to dub Vegeta&#x27;s adult incarnation in &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot;, Laura Bailey voiced Vegeta&#x27;s child incarnation in &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot; and Justin Briner voiced Vegeta&#x27;s child incarnation in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;.

In Brazil, where &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is a huge success, Vegeta has been voiced by Alfredo Rollo since his debut. In Latin American Spanish, he&#x27;s consistently been voiced by René García.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;===
Vegeta is introduced as a member of the race. He travels to Earth with his partner Nappa to use the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. Nappa easily fights off Earth&#x27;s heroes and kills Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Yamcha, and Piccolo in the process. Goku then arrives after completing his training with Kaiō-sama. Goku easily defeats Nappa who is then killed by Vegeta, for the shame of being defeated by a low class Saiyan such as Goku. Vegeta fights Goku and is severely beaten by Goku&#x27;s Kaioken technique, forcing him to resort to his Ozaru form to overpower Goku, the first time he has ever transformed in single combat, but he is unable to beat the rest of the heroes due to his sustained injuries from Goku, Gohan, Krillin and Yajirobe. Exhausted and on the brink of death, he barely escapes with his life and is further humiliated by the fact that Goku pleaded with Krillin to spare his life.

Vegeta then travels to planet Namek in an attempt to wish for immortality using that planet&#x27;s Dragon Balls, Earth&#x27;s Dragon Balls having ceased to exist following Piccolo&#x27;s death, cutting the tyrant Frieza off from making the same wish in the process. Upon arrival, Vegeta manages to kill many of Frieza&#x27;s henchmen and also mercilessly destroys a defenseless Namekian village for their Dragon Ball. Later on Vegeta is forced to team up with Gohan, Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin so they can fight off the Ginyu Force and later Frieza. He also kills most members of the Ginyu Force after they are weakened by Goku. Ultimately, he is severely beaten and mortally wounded by Frieza; as he dies, he begs Goku to avenge him and all the other Saiyans whom he was their prince. Vegeta is later unintentionally revived with a wish to revive all of Frieza&#x27;s victims from the Dragon Balls from Earth, and is subsequently sent to Earth with another wish so that he will survive Namek&#x27;s impending explosion. Vegeta later learns that Goku defeated Frieza and managed to flee Namek in time.
After Frieza&#x27;s final defeat, Vegeta chooses to stay on Earth to await Goku&#x27;s return and has a son named Trunks with Bulma. Three years later, Vegeta finally becomes a Super Saiyan and easily destroys Android 19, sent by Dr. Gero to kill Goku. However, even as a Super Saiyan, he is easily defeated by Android 18. Afterwards, Vegeta ascends beyond the Super Saiyan level while training with Future Trunks, a version of his son from an alternate timeline, in the and pummels the artificial life form Cell after he has absorbed Android 17. Vegeta&#x27;s overconfidence leads him to allow Cell to absorb Android 18, upon which Cell achieves his third &quot;perfect&quot; form. After Vegeta fails to defeat Perfect Cell, he is forced to participate in Cell&#x27;s martial arts tournament known as the Cell Games, in which he makes a crucial intervention so Gohan can overpower and defeat Cell in his Super Perfect form.

Seven years later, Vegeta allows himself to be consumed by Babidi&#x27;s evil power for his own desire to become powerful enough to fight and defeat Goku. The M on Vegeta’s forehead stands for Majin. It is a seal put by Babidi to indicate that he controls Vegeta in a certain way. It was placed through black magic. He knew that he was powerful enough to resist mind control. He then goes on an indiscriminate killing spree to provoke Goku to fight him. However, when the monster Majin Buu is revived as a result of the energy released from their fight, Vegeta knocks out Goku from behind after deceiving Goku by feigning a truce. Vegeta then faces Majin Buu alone and ends up sacrificing himself in an attempt to defeat Buu, dedicating his sacrifice to Bulma, Trunks, and also Goku. With all other fighters dead or absorbed, Vegeta is allowed to recover his body and returns to Earth to help Goku, the last warrior remaining, against the threat of Buu. He reluctantly combines bodies with Goku using the &quot;Potara&quot; earrings, to create the fused warrior Vegito, who completely overwhelms Buu with his strength. Eventually, Vegito allows himself to be absorbed into Buu&#x27;s body to free the other heroes absorbed by Buu, but this leads to the splitting of the fusion. Goku and Vegeta manage to free their allies who have been absorbed by Buu, causing him to undergo a final transformation, which results in his return to his original Kid Buu form. On the Kaiō-shin&#x27;s planet, after getting revived once more thanks to the Namekian Dragon Balls, Vegeta battles Buu again to buy time for Goku to gather energy for the &quot;Genki Dama&quot;, which he uses to defeat Majin Buu once and for all. It is during this fight that Vegeta finally admits Goku as both his superior and friend.

Ten years later, at the next World Martial Arts Tournament, Vegeta is among those who witnesses Goku&#x27;s battle with Buu&#x27;s human reincarnation, Uub, and later bids Goku farewell as Goku departs with Uub to his village to train him as his successor.

===&quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;===
In &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, Vegeta tries to appease Beerus so that he will not destroy the Earth and briefly surpasses Goku because of a power boost induced by rage by Beerus slapping Bulma; he then later participates in a ritual to transform Goku into a Super Saiyan god and watches him fight the god of destruction, and in &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot;, Vegeta trains off planet with Whis and returns to Earth to combat the resurrected Frieza, being killed by him when he destroys the Earth, which is reversed by Whis, allowing Goku in the nick of time to finish the tyrant off with a &quot;Kamehameha&quot; wave, in which Vegeta moves out of range.

After the latter two films and anime adaptation in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, Vegeta participates in a tournament where he defeats Frost, Magetta, and Cabba, but is defeated by the assassin Hit. He travels to Planet Potaufeu to retrieve Goten and Trunks, where he fights a copy of himself created by Commeson. He is then reunited with Future Trunks and begins training to fight the evil Goku Black, also training Trunks for the fight. Vegeta travels to the future to counter Goku Black, but is defeated and returns to the past. Vegeta heals and returns to the future for a rematch. Failing to defeat Goku Black before traveling to the present, where he trains, giving him enough strength to best Goku Black in their next encounter. Vegeta and Goku then meet their match against Zamasu&#x27;s fused form, forcing them to once again fuse into Vegito, who defuses from overusing his energy. Vegeta later aids Trunks in defeating Zamasu. Vegeta loses a battle to Arale, and later declines training with Goku due to Bulma&#x27;s pregnancy. When his daughter, Bulla, is born, Vegeta develops a strong attachment to her and becomes very protective over her wellbeing.

Vegeta decides to enter in the Tournament of Power in order to protect his family. During the tournament Vegeta is successful in knocking out numerous fighters. He knocks out Toppo, who achieved the power of a God of Destruction, and then aids Goku in fighting the last remaining member of Universe 11, Jiren. It is during his fight with Jiren and Toppo that Vegeta breaks his limits by his own accord. With two minutes remaining in the tournament, Jiren knocks Vegeta out, who then tearfully sends the last of his remaining power to Goku. In the film &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&quot;, Vegeta and Goku battle Frieza&#x27;s newest recruit, the Saiyan Broly, but he proves too powerful for either of them. Left with no other options, Vegeta learns the fusion dance and fuses with Goku, becoming Gogeta and stopping Broly&#x27;s rampage. After these events, Vegeta and Goku had been recruited by the Galactic Patrol to stop the wicked warlock Moro, who escaped along with his comrades. They confront and fail to defeat him, suffering wounds from the battle. Vegeta resolves to go to Yardrat to train and obtain a means to stop Moro. Returning after having used &quot;Shunkan Ido&quot;, Vegeta takes away Moro&#x27;s stolen life energy and revives the victims of Namek in an act of redemption using a new technique. He maintains the upper-hand, savagely beating the warlock until the tide turns against his favour when Moro absorbs one of his comrades to bolster his power, beating Vegeta into unconsciousness. When Moro starts absorbing the Earth&#x27;s energy after having merged with it, a healed up Vegeta arrives just in time to aid Goku by not only fissioning the energy out of him to prevent him from hiding his weakpoint, but also by personally gathering the necessary energy from the other Dragon Team members and Oob to send it to Goku for him to channel his Ultra Instinct powers one more time and kill Moro (while saving the planet) for good.

Later on, Vegeta and Goku were invited by the alien beings called the Heeters into defeating the powerful Cerealean sniper named Granolah. He engages Granolah in battle after he defeats Goku in his Ultra Instinct state, and gains the upper-hand using the power of Destroyer Gods in a new form he labels &quot;Ultra Ego&quot;, in opposition to his rival&#x27;s Ultra Instinct, that he achieved during training with Beerus, but is beaten in turn after Granolah unleashes his true power. After the Namekian, Monaito, intervenes, he confirms to Goku about the identity of his father, Bardock. After the Heeter, Gas, shows up in order to settle a grudge on the Cerealean, Vegeta, in a show of stubborn pride, gives Granolah a senzu bean so he can fight Gas. Later, he and Goku struggle against the powerful Heeter and are beaten, but are saved at the last moment by the unexpected arrival of Frieza, who proceeds to murder Gas and Elec for their betrayal. He beats Vegeta and Goku down in one blow upon unveiling his new powers, but ultimately spares them.

In &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, Vegeta trains with Goku and Broly on Beerus&#x27; planet, where he attempts to learn the ways Jiren uses to efficiently use his power. He spars with Goku without transformations or energy attacks. He is unable to get contacted because of Beerus&#x27; ice cream cup obstructing Whis&#x27; staff, leaving the situation on Earth to be handled by Piccolo and whoever associates he can enlist. In the post-credits scene, exhausted, Vegeta lands the last blow on Goku, triumphantly declaring himself the winner, much to the boredom of Cheelai and comically moved emotion from Broly and Lemo.

===In other media===

After leaving, Vegeta destroys the planet from space. After the Namek arc, Vegeta travels across space in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt at finding Goku, defeating remnants of Frieza&#x27;s army. After the Buu arc, Vegeta attends a gathering with the other heroes.

Later, he fights Super Android #17, but again, he is knocked out and nearly killed. When Omega Shenron wreaks havoc, he fights with Goku as a Super Saiyan 4 but the two eventually revert to normal. Afterwards, Vegeta says a farewell to Goku, who leaves the duty of protecting Earth in Vegeta&#x27;s hands before he flies off into the sky on Shenron.

Vegeta has appeared in many video games related to the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise as both a playable character and boss. In several games, Vegeta is capable of transforming into a Super Saiyan 3, first introduced in &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Raging Blast&quot;. In the 2003 game &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2&quot;, Vegeta can be absorbed by Boo as one of the alternate forms exclusive to the game. In the 2010 arcade game &quot;Dragon Ball: Heroes&quot;, Vegeta bests Super 17 before and after he merges with Android 18. A Time Breaker-possessed version of Vegeta also appears in the game. In the 2015 game &quot;Dragon Ball: Xenoverse&quot;, Vegeta serves as a mentor to the player character, teaching &quot;Galic Gun&quot;, &quot;Final Barrage&quot;, &quot;Shine Shot&quot;, and &quot;Final Flash&quot;. He has also appeared in other non &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;-related video games, such as &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot;, &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;, and even in the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;/&quot;One Piece&quot;/&quot;Naruto&quot; crossover game &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N&quot;.

Vegeta has made several appearances in other manga, one of which is in Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; self-parody &quot;Neko Majin&quot;, where he battles the titular character. In the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;One Piece&quot; crossover, &quot;Cross Epoch&quot;, Vegeta is re-imagined as a captain of a crew of air pirates which includes Trunks, Usopp, and Nico Robin. On September 15, 2006, Vegeta made a guest appearance in a chapter of the &quot;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo&quot; manga, &quot;Super Kochikame&quot;, entitled . Vegeta appears in the &quot;Karate Shōkōshi Kohinata Minoru&quot; manga in Chapter 178. Two characters go to a restaurant that features live Muay Thai boxing and Vegeta is in the background cheering. He also makes a single panel appearance in Toriyama&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child&quot; special. He is also had an appearance in the newest Dragon Ball Super and Dragon Ball Heroes.

Vegeta has also been the victim of parody: the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; &quot;Gag Special 2005&quot; issue released on November 12, 2004, featured a &quot;Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo&quot; one-shot &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; parody manga. The manga was a humorous retelling of the battle between Goku and Vegeta initial battle; Jelly Jiggler was Goku and Don Patch was Vegeta.

Vegeta has made two contributions to music: in the eighth installment of &quot;Hit Song Collection series&quot; entitled &quot;Character Special 2&quot;, Vegeta sings the song &quot;Vegeta-sama no Oryori Jigoku!!&quot;. The song focuses of Vegeta cooking a special Okonomiyaki, and in &quot;Dragon Ball Kai: Song Collection&quot; he sings the song &quot;Saiyan Blood&quot;, which he brags about how great he is. Other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;-related songs that center around Vegeta are &quot;Koi no Nazonazo&quot; by Kuko and Tricky Shirai which focuses on his and Bulma&#x27;s relationship and &quot;Ai wa Ballad no Yō ni~Vegeta no Theme~&quot; by Shin Oya which represents Vegeta&#x27;s reflections on his life and then current family.

==Abilities==
Up until his tail was cut off, Vegeta could turn into a gigantic monkey-like creature called an by looking at a full moon, an ability common of all Saiyans with tails. Vegeta has the ability to create and enhance attacks with the use of &quot;ki&quot;. He also has the ability to use , which enables him to fly. Constant training and his Saiyan heritage have given him vast superhuman strength, durability, speed, and reflexes. Vegeta can increase his physical capabilities and flight speed many fold if he directs ki into them.

Vegeta is known to give names for his various energy attacks. In his early appearance, Vegeta is seen to use attacks similar to several of the protagonists of the series, such as a , a laser-like disk capable of cutting through solid objects, and a ki wave similar to Goku&#x27;s &quot;Kamehameha&quot;. One of his better known attacks is the , although he uses it only once in the &quot;Z&quot; series proper; during his battle against Goku in an attempt to destroy the Earth. He later develops the and the techniques, which are much more powerful than his older energy attacks. One of Vegeta&#x27;s most commonly used tactics in the series is when he bombards an opponent with an array of small &quot;ki&quot; blasts. He is not known to have an official name for this attack, but it is occasionally called . Later on in the franchise, he develops an even more powerful version of his &quot;Final Flash&quot; attack, called . In &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, Vegeta displays a powerful new attack, entitling it the , where he uses his left hand to fire off a massive beam of green &quot;ki&quot; that widens with distance. Because of his immense strength and power, Vegeta, along with many other characters from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise, can destroy entire planets if not star systems, galaxies and even entire Universes with single attacks if he intends to.

Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. Though he lost his Great Ape form, he gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues. Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful , &quot;Super Saiyan Blue&quot; for short, under Whis&#x27;s tutelage. It is later revealed that he now has access to the red-haired form, originally obtained by Goku, most notably during his fight against Broly.

During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks an enhanced version of the Super Saiyan Blue form, evolving his transformation by breaking his limits by his own accord.

During the &quot;Granolah the Survivor&quot; arc of the manga, Vegeta trains under Beerus to master the God of Destruction&#x27;s power of . This training eventually culminates in Vegeta acquiring a form that he labels , elevating him to be as powerful as Goku&#x27;s completed &quot;Ultra Instinct&quot;. The &quot;Ultra Ego&quot; state allows Vegeta to become more powerful as he takes more damage.

Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the &quot;Potara&quot; earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kaiō-shin. This results in a &#x27;potara fusion&#x27; creating , who, in his reappearance in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method is by performing the &#x27;Metamorese Fusion Dance&#x27;, which creates .

==Reception==

Vegeta has generally received praise by various reviewers from manga, anime and other media. Theron Martin from Anime News Network noted Vegeta&#x27;s pride as being partially responsible for the success of the series. His fight against Goku during the final story arc was also commented to be very entertaining, despite its length as well as Goku and Vegeta&#x27;s fighting styles, which Martin considered to have become stale. In another review, Theron noted Vegeta&#x27;s overcoming his pride to help defeat Cell as the best scene from the fight against said antagonist due to how it creates the climax of the scene. Todd Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk commented on Vegeta&#x27;s skills and anger, noting them to be a good combination for any fight even though it is a one-sided battle due to how powerful he is. Douglass called his reveal as a villain during the appearance of Babidi, &quot;the real meat&quot; of the story. Carlos Ross from Them Anime Reviews found Vegeta and Bulma&#x27;s relationship to have too much comic potential and comments that such characterization was lost.

Vegeta is a popular character in the series, placing fourth in the 1993 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character popularity poll voted on by &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; readers, and moved up to second in the 1995 one. In 2004, fans of the series voted him the second most popular character for a poll in the book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;.

There has also been multiple criticism to his relationship with Bulma with writers finding it forced. In About.com &quot;Top 8 Anime Love Stories&quot;, Vegeta and Bulma&#x27;s relationship ranked second with Katherine Luther commenting that such a relationship was unpredictable by fans. Japanese voice actor Toru Furuya expressed shock Trunks was Bulma&#x27;s and Vegeta&#x27;s child from the future despite the fact that Yamcha and Bulma were often in a relationship and Yamcha was turned into a cheater to cause such change. Hiromi Tsuru, Bulma&#x27;s first Japanese actress, was also shocked by this change, believing her character would end with Yamcha. Bulma&#x27;s voice actress joked that it was difficult for her to love Vegeta, having thought Bulma would end up with Yamcha. Mania Entertainment writer Briana Lawerence listed Vegeta 9th in the article 10 Male Headaches of Anime, criticizing his personality and his repeated desire to surpass Goku&#x27;s power.

Vegeta has appeared in the Anime Grand Prix poll taking high places in the category &quot;best male character&quot; in the 1991 poll and 1992 poll. Vegeta was placed twenty-first in IGN&#x27;s 2009 top anime character of all-time list, calling him &quot;the original unmitigated bastard&quot; that preceded Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge, and in the tenth spot in 2014. Vegeta came third on IGN&#x27;s 2014 Top 10 Anime Villains list, stating, &quot;The most famous bad-guy-turned-not-so-bad in all of anime. Vegeta started out as an alien punk with a sadistic streak and an inferiority complex, but over time he became one of Goku&#x27;s friends, and every now and then, if he was feeling nice that day, he&#x27;d help save the world.&quot; A Biglobe poll conducted in 2012 listed Vegeta at number 16 of Japanese fans&#x27; favorite &quot;tsundere&quot; characters, the highest among male characters on that list, and a Thai magazine about anime characters also listed him among male tsunderes.

A poll by Viz Media, editor responsible for the publication of the series in North America and Europe, confirms that Vegeta is the most popular character in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. Both Goku and Vegeta were criticized for being too overpowered in &quot;Super&quot; to the point they steal the series&#x27; spotlight to the supporting cast while their strategies either lack complexity or create a plothole such as the time limit to the fusion Vegetto.

==Cultural impact==
Vegeta&#x27;s quote &quot;It&#x27;s Over 9000!&quot; has become an internet meme and a popular catchphrase referring to a large number or great quantity. The line originates from the 21st episode of the Ocean Productions English dub, &quot;The Return of Goku&quot;, where Vegeta is voiced by Brian Drummond.

The costume worn by the antagonist Erik Killmonger in the 2018 film &quot;Black Panther&quot; is strikingly similar to Vegeta&#x27;s costume. Killmonger is portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, who is known to be a fan of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. Jordan said Killmonger&#x27;s battle armor may have been inspired by Vegeta&#x27;s battle armor.

===Professional sports===
American UFC fighter Marcus Brimage is an avid fan of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, even citing the series as one of his inspirations for taking up mixed-martial arts. He names the first fight between Goku and Vegeta as one of his favorite battles in the series. American athlete Ronda Rousey wore a singlet referencing Vegeta and the &#x27;It&#x27;s Over 9000!&#x27; meme at Wrestlemania 31. Boca Juniors player Eduardo Salvio often celebrates his goals with a &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; reference, including Vegeta&#x27;s &quot;Final Flash&quot; attack.

===Music===
American rapper Soulja Boy has two songs, titled “Anime” and “Goku”, which reference Vegeta in the lyrics.
In the song entitled &quot;Christ Conscious&quot; by Joey Badass, the song&#x27;s lyrics include the following line: &quot;Got dragon balls, like my name was Vegeta &quot;.
The demo version of the song from &quot;First Impressions&quot; by Thrice has a sample of Vegeta in the intro from the original Ocean dub: &quot;No way! How? It can&#x27;t be! Kakarot a Super Saiyan? But he&#x27;s a low-class soldier, it doesn&#x27;t make any sense!&quot;.
The third album released by the musical-comedy group Starbomb features a song titled &quot;Vegeta&#x27;s Serenade&quot;. The song centers around Vegeta trying to write a love song for Bulma, but keeps getting distracted by his hatred for Goku.

<text>Persicaria is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the knotweed family, Polygonaceae. Plants of the genus are known commonly as knotweeds or smartweeds. It has a cosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide. The genus was segregated from &quot;Polygonum&quot;.

==Description==
The genus includes annual and perennial herbs with taproots or fibrous root systems, or with rhizomes or stolons. The stems are often erect but may be prostrate along the ground, and some species are prickly. The stems are self-supporting or twining and climbing. The leaves are alternately arranged, deciduous, and variously shaped. The brownish or reddish ochrea may be leathery to papery. The inflorescence may be a panicle or a spikelike or headlike arrangement of fascicles of flowers. The flower is white, greenish, reddish, pink or purple, with the tepals partially fused together along the bases. The fruit is an achene which can take a number of shapes, including a disc or a sphere.

==Taxonomy==
Within the family Polygonaceae, &quot;Persicaria&quot; is placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae, where the tribe Persicarieae consists of two sister genera, &quot;Bistorta&quot; and &quot;Koenigia&quot;, together with &quot;Persicaria&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; was a British aircraft carrier built for the Royal Navy and was the world&#x27;s first ship to be designed as an aircraft carrier, although the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s was the first to be commissioned. The ship&#x27;s construction began during the First World War, but she was not completed until after the end of the war, having been delayed by multiple changes in her design after she was laid down. After she was launched, the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard which built her closed, and her fitting out was suspended. Most of the changes made were to optimise her design, in light of the results of experiments with operational carriers.

Finally commissioned in 1924, &quot;Hermes&quot; served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet before spending the bulk of her career assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and the China Station. In the Mediterranean, she worked with other carriers developing multi-carrier tactics. While at the China Station, she helped to suppress piracy in Chinese waters. &quot;Hermes&quot; returned home in 1937 and was placed in reserve before becoming a training ship in 1938.

When the Second World War began in September 1939, the ship was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet and conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Western Approaches. She was transferred to Dakar in October to cooperate with the French Navy in hunting down German commerce raiders and blockade runners. Aside from a brief refit, &quot;Hermes&quot; remained there until the fall of France and the establishment of Vichy France at the end of June 1940. Supported by several cruisers, the ship then blockaded Dakar and attempted to sink the by exploding depth charges underneath her stern, as well as sending Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to attack her at night. While returning from this mission, &quot;Hermes&quot; rammed a British armed merchant cruiser in a storm and required several months of repairs in South Africa, then resumed patrolling for Axis shipping in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.

In February 1941, the ship supported Commonwealth forces in Italian Somaliland during the East African Campaign and did much the same two months later in the Persian Gulf during the Anglo-Iraqi War. After that campaign, &quot;Hermes&quot; spent most of the rest of the year patrolling the Indian Ocean. She was refitted in South Africa between November 1941 and February 1942 and then joined the Eastern Fleet at Ceylon.

&quot;Hermes&quot; was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when a warning of an Indian Ocean raid by the Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that day for the Maldives with no aircraft on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from &quot;Hermes&quot; were lost in the sinking.

The wreck of the ship was discovered in the Bay of Bengal some sixty years after she was sunk roughly 45 mile northeast of Batticaloa. 
&quot;Hermes&quot; is shallow enough to be visited by recreational divers and is frequently visited by tourists.

==Development==
Like &quot;Hōshō&quot;, &quot;Hermes&quot; was based on a cruiser-type hull and she was initially designed to carry both wheeled aircraft and seaplanes. The ship&#x27;s design was derived from a 1916 seaplane carrier design by Gerard Holmes and Sir John Biles, but was considerably enlarged by Sir Eustace d&#x27;Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), in his April 1917 sketch design. Her most notable feature was the seaplane slipway that comprised three sections. The seaplanes would taxi onto the rigid submerged portion aft and dock with a trolley that would carry the aircraft into the hangar. A flexible submerged portion separated the rear section from the rigid forward portion of the slipway to prevent the submerged part from rolling with the ship&#x27;s motion. The entire slipway could be retracted into the ship, and a gantry crane ran the length of the slipway to help recover the seaplanes. The design showed two islands with the full-length flight deck running between them. Each island contained one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators); the forward lift measured and the rear . This design displaced and accommodated six large Short Type 184 seaplanes and six smaller Sopwith Baby seaplanes. The ship&#x27;s armament consisted of six guns.

The DNC produced a detailed design in January 1918 that made some changes to his original sketch, including the addition of a rotating bow catapult to allow the ship to launch aircraft regardless of wind direction, and the ship was laid down that month to the revised design. Progress was slow, as most of the resources of the shipyard were being used to finish the conversion of from a battleship to an aircraft carrier. The leisurely pace of construction allowed for more time with which to rework the ship&#x27;s design. By mid-June the slipway had been deleted from the design and the ship&#x27;s armament had been revised to consist of eleven guns and only a single anti-aircraft gun. By this time, the uncertainty about the best configuration for an aircraft carrier had increased to the point that the Admiralty forbade the builder from working above the hangar deck without express permission. Later that year the ship&#x27;s design was revised again to incorporate a single island, her lifts were changed to a uniform size of , and her armament was altered to ten 6-inch guns and four 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. These changes increased her displacement to .

Construction was suspended after &quot;Hermes&quot; was launched in September 1919 as the Admiralty awaited the results of flight trials with &quot;Eagle&quot; and . Her design was modified in March 1920 with an island superstructure and funnel to starboard, and the forward catapult was removed. The logic behind placing the island to starboard was that pilots generally preferred to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing. A prominent tripod mast was added to house the fire-control systems for her guns.

The last revisions were made to the ship&#x27;s design in May 1921, after the trials with &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot;. The lifts were moved further apart to allow for more space for the arresting gear and they were enlarged to allow the wings of her aircraft to be spread in the hangar. Her anti-ship armament was reduced to six guns and her flight deck was faired into the bow.

===Description===
&quot;Hermes&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load. Each of the ship&#x27;s two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller shaft at a speed of . Steam was supplied by six Yarrow boilers operating at a pressure of . The turbines were designed for a total of , but they produced during her sea trials, giving &quot;Hermes&quot; a speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at .

The ship&#x27;s flight deck was long and her lifts&#x27; dimensions were . Her hangar was long, wide and high. &quot;Hermes&quot; was fitted with longitudinal arresting gear. A large crane was positioned behind the island. Because of her size, the ship was able to carry only about 20 aircraft. Bulk petrol storage consisted of . The ship&#x27;s crew totalled 33 officers and 533 men, exclusive of the air group, in 1939.

For self-defence against enemy warships, &quot;Hermes&quot; had six BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns, three on each side of the ship. All three of her QF Mk V 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were positioned on the flight deck. The ship&#x27;s waterline belt armour was thick and her flight deck, which was also the ship&#x27;s strength deck, was thick. &quot;Hermes&quot; had a metacentric height of and handled well in heavy weather. However, she had quite a large surface area exposed to the wind and required as much as 25 to 30 degrees of weather helm at low speed when the wind was blowing from the side.

==Service==

&quot;Hermes&quot; was laid down by Sir W. G. Armstrong-Whitworth and Company at Walker on the River Tyne on 15 January 1918 as the world&#x27;s first purpose-designed aircraft carrier, and was launched on 11 September 1919. She was christened by Mrs. A. Cooper, daughter of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Walter Long. The shipyard was scheduled to close at the end of 1919 and the Admiralty ordered the ship towed to Devonport, where she arrived in January 1920 for completion.

===1920s===
Captain Arthur Stopford was appointed as the ship&#x27;s commanding officer in February 1923 and the ship began her sea trials in August. After fitting-out, &quot;Hermes&quot; was commissioned on 19 February 1924 and later assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She conducted flying trials with the Fairey IIID reconnaissance biplanes for the next several months. &quot;Hermes&quot; participated in the fleet review conducted by King George V on 26 July in Spithead. Afterwards she was refitted until November and then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. She arrived at Malta on 22 November and needed some repairs to fix storm damage suffered en route. At this time the ship embarked No. 403 Flight with Fairey Flycatcher fighters and 441 Flight with Fairey IIIDs. &quot;Hermes&quot; conducted flying exercises with &quot;Eagle&quot; and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1925 before she began a seven-week refit in Malta on 27 March, then sailed for Portsmouth where she arrived on 29 May after her aircraft had flown ashore.

&quot;Hermes&quot; sailed for the China Station on 17 June with 403 and 441 Flights aboard, but made a lengthy pause en route in the Mediterranean during which Captain Stopford was replaced by Captain C. P. Talbot. She arrived at Hong Kong on 10 August 1925. The ship made her first foreign port visit to Amoy in November. &quot;Hermes&quot; returned to the Mediterranean in early 1926 and was refitted at Malta between April and June. 441 Flight was transferred to &quot;Eagle&quot; at this time in exchange for 440 Flight which flew aboard in September. 442 Flight also joined the ship at this time; both flights were equipped with Fairey IIIs. The ship exercised with the Mediterranean Fleet after her refit was completed and Captain R. Elliot relieved Captain Talbot on 14 August. &quot;Hermes&quot; returned to Hong Kong on 11 October and conducted routine training until she sailed to the naval base at Weihaiwei on 27 July 1927 to escape the summer heat. The ship rendezvoused in September with &quot;Argus&quot;, which was to replace her on the China Station. Before she departed the area, however, both ships attacked the pirate base at Bias Bay and their fleet of junks and sampans. &quot;Hermes&quot; reached the United Kingdom on 26 October and began a refit at Chatham Dockyard at the beginning of November. One of her 4-inch guns was removed at this time. Sometime after this refit, the ship was provided with two single 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; AA guns.

Captain Eliot was relieved by Captain G. Hopwood on 2 December and the ship sailed for the China Station on 21 January 1928. The Fairey IIIDs of 440 Flight had been replaced by IIIFs, and the ship kept the same three flights for this deployment. En route to Hong Kong, &quot;Hermes&quot; stopped at Bangkok, Siam, in March for four days and was inspected by King Rama VII. She reached Hong Kong on 18 March, relieving &quot;Argus&quot;. The ship spent a month in the port of Yantai in May and then the following three weeks in Weihaiwei. While visiting Qinhuangdao in July, one of her Fairey IIIF seaplanes made a forced landing outside the port; the rescued the pilot and towed the aircraft back to the carrier. During the rest of the year, the ship visited Shanghai, Manila, as well as Kudat and Jesselton in Borneo. She began a refit in Hong Kong in January 1929 and Captain J. D. Campbell assumed command on 28 March. After refit was completed in April,&quot; Hermes&quot; conducted flying training before sailing up the Yangtze River to visit Nanjing the following month. Afterwards she spent the next four months at Weihaiwei. She made visits to Qingdao and Japan before returning to Hong Kong on 29 October where she remained for the rest of the year.

===1930s===
On 28 January 1930, &quot;Hermes&quot; transported the British Minister to China, Sir Miles Lampson, to Nanjing for talks with the Chinese Government over the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and she remained there until she sailed downriver to Shanghai on 2 March. By the end of the month, the carrier was back in Hong Kong and remained there until June when she returned to Weihaiwei for her annual summer visit. The ship briefly returned to Hong Kong before departing for Great Britain on 7 August. &quot;Hermes&quot; reached Portsmouth on 23 September, but remained there only six days before transferring to Sheerness. Captain E. J. G. MacKinnon relieved Captain Campbell there on 2 October. She was given a brief refit at Chatham Dockyard before sailing for the China Station. The ship had aboard only 403 and 440 Flights on this deployment and transported six Blackburn Ripons to deliver to Malta and HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;. Hermes departed Portsmouth on 12 November and reached Hong Kong on 2 January 1931. En route to her summer refuge at Weihaiwei, the ship received a report on 9 June that the submarine had been sunk there while on exercise. Captain MacKinnon took command of the rescue effort when &quot;Hermes&quot; arrived at the accident site an hour afterwards. Eight of the submarine&#x27;s crewmen managed to escape through the forward torpedo hatch, but only six of those reached the surface where they were picked up and treated in &quot;Hermes&quot;″s sickbay; two of those six subsequently died.
The ship remained at Weihaiwei until the end of August when she sailed up the Yangtze River for Hankou. She reached the inland port on 5 September and dispatched armed guards to put down unrest on several British-owned merchant ships. Her primary purpose, though, was to aid the Chinese government&#x27;s survey of the massive flooding in the area. Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, were also in the city to survey the flooding with their Lockheed Sirius float-plane and they were invited to use the carrier as their base. Unfortunately, their aircraft was flipped on the morning of 2 October by a strong current as it was being hoisted back into the water by &quot;Hermes&quot;″s crane. They were quickly rescued by a boat from the carrier, but their aircraft was damaged. Captain MacKinnon offered to take them and their aircraft to Shanghai where it could be repaired and the ship departed the next day. She remained in Shanghai until 2 November, when she sailed for Hong Kong. &quot;Hermes&quot; received a distress message on 3 November from a Japanese merchantman, SS &quot;Ryinjin Maru&quot;, that had run aground on the Tan Rocks near the Chinese mainland at the mouth of the Taiwan Strait. The ship managed to rescue nine crew members before she was relieved by the and could proceed to Hong Kong. She reached the city on 7 November and remained in the area until April 1932.

Captain MacKinnon took sick the next month and he was relieved by Captain W. B. Mackenzie on 25 February. After a short refit, the carrier, escorted by the destroyer &quot;Whitehall&quot;, made a brief visit to Amoy in late April before sailing for Weihaiwei where she stayed until 17 September. On that day, &quot;Hermes&quot; sailed for the Japanese city of Nagasaki and then spent four weeks in Shanghai. The ship did not return to Hong Kong until 28 October and spent the next few months there. In January 1933, the carrier visited the Philippines for several weeks before returning to Hong Kong where she was given a brief refit. After short visits to Qingdao and Weihaiwei, &quot;Hermes&quot; departed Hong Kong in mid-June for Great Britain. She reached Sheerness on 22 July, but the ship was transferred shortly afterwards to Chatham Dockyard and opened to the public during Navy Week in early August. She sailed the next month for Devonport Dockyard for a thorough refit. Transverse arresting gear was fitted and her machinery was thoroughly overhauled. Sometime in 1932, the two single 2-pounders were replaced by two quadruple .50-calibre Mark III machine gun mounts.

Captain the Honourable G. Fraser was appointed on 15 August 1934 as the new commanding officer and the ship began trials of the new equipment in early November. At the same time the nine Fairey Seal torpedo bombers of 824 Squadron joined the ship. &quot;Hermes&quot; left Portsmouth on 18 November for the China Station and arrived at Hong Kong on 4 January 1935. The Hawker Osprey reconnaissance biplanes of 803 Squadron were transferred aboard from &quot;Eagle&quot; before that ship left Hong Kong. Pirates captured a British-owned merchant ship, SS &quot;Tungchow&quot;, with 90 British and American children on board on 29 January and &quot;Hermes&quot; was ordered to search for the ship when she failed to arrive at Yantai at her scheduled time. Three Seals spotted her in Bias Bay on 1 February and the pirates abandoned the ship when it was found, leaving the passengers unharmed. &quot;Hermes&quot; remained in the vicinity of Hong Kong until mid-May when she steamed to Weihaiwei. There she remained until 12 September when the Admiralty decided to transfer her to Singapore where she was closer to East Africa in case a military response to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia was deemed necessary. The ship arrived on 19 September and remained in the area for the next five months.

The ship&#x27;s aircraft were detailed to search for the missing &quot;Lady Southern Cross&quot; of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith when it failed to arrive at Singapore on 8 November during an attempt to set a new speed record between Britain and Australia. No sign was found of either the aircraft or its crew despite a month-long search. &quot;Hermes&quot; returned to Hong Kong at the beginning of March 1936 before beginning a tour of Japan on 21 April, escorted by the destroyers and . She summered at Weihaiwei and did not return to Hong Kong until the end of October. For most of January 1937, the carrier, accompanied by the heavy cruiser and the destroyers &quot;Duncan&quot; and , toured the Dutch East Indies. The ship&#x27;s torpedo bombers practised torpedo attacks on the cruisers and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; in February, working with the Royal Air Force&#x27;s torpedo bombers based at RAF Seletar, Singapore. &quot;Hermes&quot; left Singapore on 17 March, leaving 803 Squadron behind, and reached Plymouth on 3 May 1937. Following the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May for King George VI, she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. On 16 July 1938, &quot;Hermes&quot; was transferred from the Reserve Fleet and became a training ship at Devonport.

Plans were made in 1937 to replace &quot;Hermes&quot;″s three single 4-inch guns with two twin 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, one forward and another aft of the island, as well as two octuple 2-pounder mounts. A single High-Angle Control System would have been fitted to control these guns, but the dockyard was overwhelmed with other work and couldn&#x27;t begin to design the changes until July 1938. They were scheduled to be installed between September and December 1939, but the beginning of the war intervened and nothing was done. The ship&#x27;s petrol storage was to be increased to in April 1940, but this also does not seem to have occurred.

===World War II===
The ship was given a brief refit in early August 1939 and Captain F. E. P. Hutton assumed command on 23 August. She was recommissioned the following day, and 12 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 814 Squadron flew aboard on 1 September. &quot;Hermes&quot; conducted anti-submarine patrols in mid-September in an effort to find and destroy U-boats in the Western Approaches. On 18 September, the day after the fleet carrier was sunk on one such patrol, &quot;Hermes&quot; located a submarine, but attacks by her escorting destroyers, and , were ineffective. The carrier was then ordered to return to Devonport where she was fitted with degaussing gear during another brief refit. On 7 October, the ship rendezvoused with the and they arrived at Dakar in French West Africa on 16 October. Designated as Force X, they began searching for German ships in the Atlantic on 25 October. &quot;Hermes&quot; performed these patrols with no sightings until the end of December when she escorted a convoy to Britain where she could be refitted from 9 January to 10 February 1940; the ship then returned to Dakar and resumed her patrols for German commerce raiders and blockade runners.

Captain Richard F. J. Onslow relieved Captain Hutton on 25 May and &quot;Hermes&quot; continued her fruitless patrols. After returning from one such patrol on 29 June, the ship was ordered to leave harbour only nine hours after her arrival and to begin a blockade of Dakar as the Governor of French Senegal had declared the colony&#x27;s allegiance to the Vichy French regime. On the night of 7/8 July, a boat from &quot;Hermes&quot; attempted to drop four depth charges underneath the French battleship &quot;Richelieu&quot;&#x27;s stern in conjunction with a torpedo attack by the Swordfish of 814 Squadron. The boat was successful in reaching the French ship, but the depth charges failed to detonate. The torpedo attack was more successful as one of the battleship&#x27;s propellers was damaged. French aircraft attacked the British forces several times in retaliation, but without success. While returning to Freetown after the attack, &quot;Hermes&quot; accidentally rammed the armed merchant cruiser HMS &quot;Corfu&quot; during a rainstorm in the dark on 10 July. The impact injured three of the carrier&#x27;s crew, one of whom subsequently died of his injuries, but no one from &quot;Corfu&quot;″s crew was injured. The two ships were locked together so that &quot;Corfu&quot;″s crew could walk from one to the other when Captain Onslow ordered most of her crew to be evacuated onto &quot;Hermes&quot;. They were pulled apart by a combination of the carrier&#x27;s turbines at full speed astern and blowing of ballast tanks on board &quot;Corfu&quot; to lighten that ship forward. &quot;Hermes&quot; had crumpled the forward of her bow, mostly above water, and was able to proceed to Freetown at , but &quot;Corfu&quot; had to be towed stern first to Freetown where she arrived three days later. The carrier joined a convoy to South Africa on 5 August and began repairs at Simonstown 12 days later. The repairs were completed on 2 November and the ship arrived back at Freetown on 29 November after working up.

The ship was joined by the light cruiser on 2 December to search for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic. They mostly operated from Saint Helena during the month and were later joined by the armed merchant cruiser to search for the pocket battleship , without success. The force sailed for Simonstown on 31 December and &quot;Hermes&quot; was dispatched to search off the South African coast for Vichy French blockade runners. One such ship was spotted on 26 January, but she returned to Madagascar. On 4 February, the ship headed north to rendezvous with the heavy cruisers and to blockade the Somali port of Kismayo which was under siege by Commonwealth forces. &quot;Hawkins&quot; captured three Italian merchantmen and &quot;Hermes&quot; captured one on 12 February.

On 22 February, the carrier was one of the ships tasked to search for &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; after she was spotted by an aircraft from the light cruiser , but the pocket battleship successfully broke contact. &quot;Hermes&quot; arrived in Colombo, Ceylon, on 4 March and continued to search for Axis shipping. She was sent to the Persian Gulf in April to support British operations in Basra, Iraq, and remained there until mid-June when she returned to patrolling the Indian Ocean between Ceylon and the Seychelles Islands. The ship continued to patrol until 19 November when she arrived in Simonstown for a refit that was not completed until 31 January 1942. &quot;Hermes&quot; was assigned to the Eastern Fleet and arrived at Colombo on 14 February. She put to sea on 19 February to receive the Swordfish of 814 Squadron and to rendezvous with the destroyer to conduct an anti-submarine patrol. The squadron was disembarked on 25 February after the ships arrived in Trincomalee Harbour. The two ships were ordered to Fremantle, Australia, in mid-March to join the Allied naval forces headquartered there, but they were recalled after three days and assigned to Force B of the Eastern Fleet.
After the raid on Colombo by the Japanese aircraft carriers on 5 April, &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Vampire&quot; were sent to Trincomalee to prepare for Operation Ironclad, the British invasion of Madagascar, and 814 Squadron was sent ashore. After advance warning of a Japanese air raid on 9 April 1942, they left Trincomalee and sailed south down the Ceylon coast before it arrived. They were spotted off Batticaloa, however, by a Japanese reconnaissance plane from the battleship . The British intercepted the spot report and ordered the ships to return to Trincomalee with the utmost dispatch and attempted to provide fighter cover for them. The Japanese launched 85 Aichi D3A dive bombers, escorted by nine Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, at the two ships. At least 32 attacked them and sank them in quick order despite the arrival of six Fairey Fulmar II fighters of No. 273 Squadron RAF. Another six Fulmars from 803 and 806 Squadrons arrived after &quot;Hermes&quot; had already sunk. The rest of the Japanese aircraft attacked other ships further north, sinking the RFA &quot;Athelstone&quot; of 5,571 gross register tonnage (GRT), her escort, the corvette , the oil tanker and the Norwegian ship of 2,924 GRT.

&quot;Hermes&quot; sank at coordinates with the loss of 307 men, including Captain Onslow. &quot;Vampire&quot;″s captain and seven crewmen were also killed. Most of the survivors of the attack were picked up by the hospital ship &quot;Vita&quot;. Japanese losses to all causes were four D3As lost and five more damaged, while two Fulmars were shot down.

====Decoy &quot;Hermes&quot;====

The merchant ship SS &quot;Mamari III&quot; was converted to resemble &quot;Hermes&quot; as a decoy ship to confuse the Axis and was redesignated as &quot;Fleet Tender C&quot;. On 4 June 1941, when she was sailing down the east coast of England to Chatham Dockyard in Kent to be converted back into a cargo ship, the decoy &quot;Hermes&quot; hit a submerged wreck off Norfolk during a German aerial attack. Before she could be refloated, she was crippled by German E-boats and abandoned in place.

<doc id="247553" wikidata="Q1034057" url="?curid=247553" title="Can't Stop (board game)">
<text>Can&#x27;t Stop is a board game designed by Sid Sackson originally published by Parker Brothers in 1980; however, that edition has been long out of print in the United States. It was reprinted by Face 2 Face Games in 2007. An iOS version was developed by Playdek and released in 2012. The goal of the game is to &quot;claim&quot; (get to the top of) three of the columns before any of the other players can. But the more that the player risks rolling the dice during a turn, the greater the risk of losing the advances made during that turn.

==Equipment==
The game equipment consists of four dice, a board, a set of eleven markers for each player, and three neutral-colored markers.

The board consists of eleven columns of spaces, one column for each of the numbers 2 through 12. The columns (respectively) have 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5 and 3 spaces each. The number of spaces in each column roughly corresponds to the likelihood of rolling them on two dice.

==Rules==
On each turn, the player rolls the four dice, then divides them into two pairs, adding up each pair. (For example, a player rolling a 1, 2, 3, and 6 could group them as 5 and 7, 4 and 8, or 3 and 9.) If the neutral markers are off the board, they are brought onto the board on the columns corresponding to these totals. If the neutral markers are already on the board in one or both of these columns, they are advanced one space upward. If the neutral markers are on the board, but only in columns that cannot be made with any pair of the current four dice, the turn is over and the player gains nothing. This is generally called &#x27;going bust.&#x27;

After moving the markers, the player chooses whether or not to roll again. If the player stops, they put markers of their color in the location of the current neutral markers. If the player restarts this column on a later turn, they start building from the place where they previously placed their markers. If the player does not stop, they must be able to advance one of the neutral markers on their next roll, or lose any advancement made this turn.

When a player reaches the top space of a column and claims it then this column is won, and no further play in that column is allowed. A player claims three columns to win the game.

The official rules merely say &quot;If you can place a marker, you must...&quot;, not stating if that applies before or after a player decides how to subdivide the four dice. This rule is potentially confusing for the following reason:
::Suppose the player has a neutral marker in the 7-column, with two un-played. The player now rolls 2-2-5-5. Of course, the player wants to declare two sevens. The player still has an unplayed neutral marker, so is the rule interpreted such that the player must place their remaining two neutral markers, playing on 4 and 10? The rule may have only been intended to apply to requiring that all die-pairs be played, if possible. For instance, if the player rolls 3-4-1-2, they may choose to make a 7 and a 3, advancing their 7 marker, and they must also place their 3 marker even though they would prefer to hold it in reserve.

==Variants==
Variants exist including Sid&#x27;s own &quot;Speed&quot; variant, which results in players jumping over their opponents&#x27; markers. This variant leads to fast-paced gameplay and a shorter game.

For a slower variant, try &quot;Blocking&quot;, where players are not allowed to end their turn if one of their markers is on top of another player&#x27;s marker. Note that this variant makes it very difficult to pass a player with an established position on the columns on the side of the board (like 2 and 12).

Another game, Can&#x27;t Stop Express, was published in 1989 by Hexagames. In &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Express&quot;, players roll dice to score points. A review for the &quot;Games International&quot; magazine commented that &quot;Like most of Sid&#x27;s games this is easy to learn yet offers considerable replay value.&quot;

== Reception ==
The game was recommended by the &quot;Spiel des Jahres&quot; jury in 1982, with the jury stating that &quot;[with] Can&#x27;t Stop, author Sid Sackson proves that he also knows how to use dice&quot;. The reviewer Mikko Saari from &quot;Lautapeliopas&quot; considered the game to be &quot;very simple&quot; and praised the engagement due to the push-your-luck mechanism.

The ship was laid down by Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness during World War II as HMS &quot;Elephant&quot;. Construction was suspended in 1945 but work was resumed in 1952 to clear the slipway and the hull was launched on 16 February 1953. The vessel remained unfinished until 1957; then she entered service on 18 November 1959 as HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; after extensive modifications which included installation of a massive Type 984 &#x27;searchlight&#x27; 3D radar, a fully angled deck with a deck-edge lift, and steam catapults. With these changes she more resembled the reconstructed aircraft carrier than the other three ships in the class.

&quot;Hermes&quot; initially operated Supermarine Scimitar, de Havilland Sea Vixen, and Fairey Gannet fixed-wing aircraft, together with Westland Whirlwind helicopters.

==Cost==
The construction cost of &quot;Hermes&quot; was £18 million, with a further £1 million for electronic equipment and a further £10 million for aircraft in 1959.

==Operations==
On 16 November 1962, &quot;Hermes&quot; was cruising off of the Pembrokeshire coast in Wales when one of her helicopters carrying two Members of Parliament, Lord Windlesham and the MP for Loughborough, John Cronin, back from the carrier, which they had been visiting, to RNAS Brawdy, crashed off St David&#x27;s Head. While Cronin and the helicopter&#x27;s two-man crew were saved by another helicopter from &quot;Hermes&quot;, Lord Windlesham and an RAF officer being carried as a passenger were killed.

=== Nuclear role in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis ===
During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the Sea Vixen FAW1s of &quot;Hermes&quot; were tasked to bomb targets in the Soviet Union with the Red Beard nuclear bombs. An observer of the Sea Vixen squadron described his experience as follows: &quot;“We used to do ground attack, and we had a nuclear capability. During the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, I was in our squadron’s nuclear team. We were on red alert for three days, not practice, but for real. I was sweating because my target was Sevastopol in the Crimea.&quot;&quot;

===Proposed operation of F-4 Phantom ===
John Hay, Civil Lord of the Admiralty, said in Parliament on 2 March 1964 that &quot;Phantoms will be operated from &quot;Hermes&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot; and the new carrier when it is built. ... Our present information and advice is that the aircraft should be able to operate from &quot;Hermes&quot; after she has undergone her refit.&quot;
This seemed optimistic, as most sources believed &quot;Victorious&quot; was the smallest carrier then in commission that the modified RN F-4K versions of the Phantom could realistically have operated from. The British Rolls-Royce Spey engines replacing the US General Electric J79 were a political necessity given the cancellation of the supersonic British Hawker Siddeley P.1154 V/STOL aircraft project. The projected superior fuel efficiency using the Spey engines was overshadowed by larger engine size and inflexibility. From the smaller &quot;Hermes&quot; maximum weight at takeoff would be 25 tons rather than 28 tons when operating off &quot;Eagle&quot;. Since this lower weight at launch from &quot;Hermes&quot; would be achieved by carrying less fuel, combat air patrol duration would be 25 to 50 percent less than from &quot;Eagle&quot;; from 2–2.5 hours to 1–1.5 hrs, and only partly compensated by refuelling when airborne. It was optimistically believed &quot;Hermes&quot; could replace its Vixens with Spey-powered Phantoms on a one-to-one basis, i.e. 11–12 with 7–8 Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. While the Phantoms built for the RN were modified in ways similar to Vought F-8 Crusaders for the French Navy – improving deceleration on landing – the modifications were not entirely successful. &quot;Hermes&quot;″s flight deck was too short, her arresting gear as well as her catapults were not powerful enough to recover or launch the F-4Ks, even though they were slightly lighter, more economical and higher performing than their US Navy counterparts. The Phantom trials held on &quot;Hermes&quot; in 1969–1970 proved this, though in the views of the then Minister of Defence, Denis Healey, the carrier could operate the most modern aircraft, but in too small numbers to be effective. While it is clear that McNamara&#x27;s claims that the F-4 was not safe for use on the USN , or 31,000-ton carriers, was rightly rejected by John Hay in 1964.

===Proposed transfer to Australia===
A 1966 review indicated that &quot;Hermes&quot; was surplus to operational requirements and she was offered to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as a replacement for HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot;. In 1968, &quot;Hermes&quot; took part in a combined exercise with the RAN, during which the carrier was visited by senior RAN officers and Australian government officials, while RAN Douglas A-4G Skyhawks and Grumman S-2 Trackers practised landings on the larger carrier. The offer was turned down due to operating and manpower costs.

===Proposed international fleet===
&quot;Hermes&quot; served as one of four Royal Navy strike carriers mainly in the Indian Ocean and finally in the Mediterranean Sea until decommissioned in 1970. She could have seen action against the Egyptians when Egypt closed off the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping in May 1967 when the UK and US contemplated forming an international fleet to open the straits with force if necessary, but the UK backed down. According to a memorandum of conversation dated 25 May 1967 between the US Secretaty of State Dean Rusk and the British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs George Thomson, &#x27;The British felt that a carrier [Hermes] in the Red Sea would be a sitting duck if Nasser got nasty.&#x27;

===Commando/ASW/STOVL carrier===

When the decision was made in the mid-1960s to phase out fixed wing carrier operations &quot;Hermes&quot; was slated to become a &quot;Commando Carrier&quot; for Royal Marine operations (similar in concept to a US Navy LHA). Therefore, &quot;Hermes&quot; was docked down in number 10 Dock in Devonport Dockyard between 1971 and 1973, undergoing a conversion in which her arresting cables, steam catapults, and 3-D radar were removed. Landing craft and berthing for 800 troops were added and her airwing became approximately 20 Westland Sea King helicopters. By 1976, with the Soviet submarine threat becoming apparent and through NATO pressure, a further mild conversion was performed for &quot;Hermes&quot; to become an anti-submarine warfare carrier to patrol the North Atlantic. &quot;Hermes&quot; underwent one more conversion and new capabilities were added when she was refitted at Portsmouth from 1980 to June 1981, during which a 12° ski-jump and facilities for operating BAe Sea Harriers were incorporated.

After this refit the air wing comprised:
*800 NAS 5 Sea Harrier FRS.1 fighter
*826 NAS 12 Sea King HAS.5 ASW

===Falklands War===
&quot;Hermes&quot; was due to be decommissioned in 1982 after the 1981 Defence Review (that would have made the Royal Navy considerably smaller) by the British government, but when the Falklands War broke out, she was made the flagship of the British forces, setting sail for the South Atlantic just three days after the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands. She sailed for the Falklands with an airgroup of 12 Sea Harrier FRS1 attack aircraft of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, and 18 Sea King helicopters. A few weeks after sailing, more aircraft were flown or transported via other ships to replace some losses and augment the task force. &quot;Hermes&quot;″s airgroup grew to 16 Sea Harriers, 10 Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR3s of the Royal Air Force, and 10 Sea Kings (after some of the helicopters were dispersed to other ships) as well as a troop of Special Air Service (SAS) and Royal Marines. As she was the RN&#x27;s largest carrier, she was considered too valuable to risk in close to the Falklands, due to the possibility of Argentine air force attacks. Her Harriers therefore operated at the limit of their endurance radius but were very successful in keeping the enemy aircraft at bay.

Air group at the height of the Falklands Conflict:
*800 NAS – 15 Sea Harrier FRS.1
*826 NAS – 5 Sea King HAS.5
*846 NAS – 5 Sea King HC.4
*No. 1 Squadron RAF – 6 Harrier GR.3

The aircraft carrier was carrying 16 nuclear depth bombs as part of her standard armament when she deployed for the Falklands, and was one of several Royal Navy warships so equipped during the war. The weapons were removed while she was in the South Atlantic during June 1982.

===After the Falklands War===
After her return home from the Falklands conflict &quot;Hermes&quot; entered into a much needed 4-month refit to her propulsion and electrical systems, as well as a thorough cleaning and repainting. When this was completed in November 1982, she embarked stores and performed work-ups exercises. She then took part in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, and the Mediterranean Sea as a commando carrier. In the autumn of 1983 she took part in her last exercise, &quot;Ocean Safari&quot;, where she reverted to a strike carrier role, embarking 12 Sea Harriers, 10 RAF Harrier GR.3s and 10 Sea Kings. After this exercise, she called into Devonport for a minor refit and thereafter into maintained reserve in Portsmouth.

In 1983, when the proposed sale of the aircraft carrier to the Royal Australian Navy was cancelled following the Falklands War, an offer was made to sell &quot;Hermes&quot; and a squadron of Sea Harriers to Australia. However the new Hawke government decided against purchasing a replacement for HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot;.

&quot;Hermes&quot; served with the Royal Navy until 12 April 1984. On this day she entered Portsmouth with a reduced crew, under her own steam, flying the White Ensign for the final time as a seagoing ship.

===&quot;Viraat&quot;===

In April 1986 &quot;Hermes&quot; was towed from Portsmouth Dockyard to Devonport Dockyard to be refitted, reactivated and sold to India, recommissioning and sailing as INS &quot;Viraat&quot; in 1987.

==Complement==
The typical aircraft complement in the late 1960s consisted of 12 Sea Vixen FAW2s, 7 Buccaneer S2s, 4 Gannet AEW3s, 1 Gannet COD4, 5 Wessex HAS3s and 1 Wessex HAS1. Hermes was recommissioned as a commando carrier in 1973, as an ASW carrier in 1976 (carrying around 20 or so Sea King and Wessex helicopters), and then as a V/STOL carrier in 1981. &quot;Hermes&quot; initial complement of aircraft as a V/STOL carrier was five Harriers and 12 Sea King helicopters, though she had the capacity for up to a total of 37 aircraft.

==Preservation attempts==
Following her decommissioning from the Indian Navy in 2017, a crowdfunding campaign was launched to preserve Hermes as a museum piece. The campaign aimed to raise £100,000, but was only able to raise £9,303 before being declared unsuccessful.

On 1 November 2018 the Maharashtra cabinet approved the conversion of &quot;Viraat&quot; into India&#x27;s first moored maritime museum and marine adventure centre. It would be located near Nivati, Sindhudurg district. On 1 July 2019 the Indian Minister of State for Defence informed the Indian Parliament that a decision to scrap Viraat had been taken due to the non-receipt of any financially self-sustaining proposal.

The ship is currently being scrapped in a ship breakers yard in Alang, India. As of December 2020, about five per cent of the ship was already gone. The distinctive take-off ramp used by the Harrier jump jets had been removed. On 10 February 2021, the Supreme Court of India had ordered the dismantling be placed on hold, following a petition by a private firm to turn the ship into a museum, but on 12 April 2021 it dismissed the petition saying it was too late since 40% of the ship had been dismantled.

<doc id="247556" wikidata="Q155024" url="?curid=247556" title="Schmalkaldic League">
<text>The Schmalkaldic League (; ; or ) was a military alliance of Lutheran principalities and cities within the Holy Roman Empire during the mid-16th century. It received its name from the town of Schmalkalden, where the group was founded in 1531.

Although created for religious motives soon after the start of the Reformation, its members later came to have the intention that the League would replace the Holy Roman Empire as their focus of political allegiance.

While it was not the first alliance of its kind, unlike previous formations, such as the League of Torgau, the Schmalkaldic League had a substantial military to defend its political and religious interests.

==Origins==

The League was officially established on 27 February 1531 by Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, and John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, the two most powerful Protestant rulers in the Holy Roman Empire at the time. It originated as a defensive religious alliance, with the members pledging to defend each other if their territories were attacked by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. At the insistence of the Elector of Saxony, membership was conditional on agreement to the Lutheran Augsburg Confession or the Reformed Tetrapolitan Confession.

==Nuremberg religious peace==
The formation of the Schmalkaldic League in 1531 and the threatening attitude of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who, in April 1532, assumed the offensive with an army of 300,000 men, caused Ferdinand of Austria to grant the religious peace.

Ferdinand had made humiliating overtures to Suleiman and as long as he hoped for a favourable response, was not inclined to grant the peace, which the Protestants demanded at the Diet of Regensburg in April 1532. However, as the army of Suleiman drew nearer, he yielded, and on 23 July 1532 the peace was concluded at Nuremberg, where the final deliberations took place.

Those who supported the Reformation obtained religious liberty until the meeting of a council and in a separate compact all proceedings in matters of religion pending before the imperial chamber court were temporarily paused.

==Growth==
In December 1535, the League admitted anyone who would subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, and Anhalt, Württemberg, Pomerania, as well as the free imperial cities of Augsburg, Frankfurt am Main, and the Free Imperial City of Kempten joined the alliance.

In 1538, the Schmalkaldic League allied with the newly reformed Denmark-Norway. In 1545, the League gained the allegiance of the Electoral Palatinate, under the control of Frederick III, Elector Palatine.

In 1544, Denmark-Norway and the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Speyer, which stated that during the reign of Christian III, Denmark-Norway would maintain a peaceful foreign policy towards the Holy Roman Empire. The league would also get limited support from Brandenburg under Joachim II Hector, but during the Schmalkaldic War he would send cavalry support to the Emperor against the league.

==Activities==
The League&#x27;s members agreed to provide 10,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry for their mutual protection. They rarely provoked Charles directly but confiscated church land, expelled bishops and Catholic princes and helped spread Lutheranism throughout northern Germany.

Martin Luther planned to present to the League the Smalcald Articles, a stricter Protestant confession, during a meeting in 1537.

Luther attended the critical meeting in 1537 but spent most of his time suffering from kidney stones. The rulers and princes even met in the home at which Luther was staying. Though Luther was asked to prepare the articles of faith that came to be known as the &quot;Smalcald Articles&quot;, they were not formally adopted at the time of the meeting, but in 1580, they were included in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot;.

==Political environment==

For 15 years, the League existed without opposition because Charles was busy fighting wars with France and the Ottoman Empire. Overall, the Ottoman–Habsburg Wars lasted from 1526 to 1571.

In 1535, Francis I of France, despite vigorously persecuting Protestants at home, supported the Protestant princes in their struggle against their common foe, Charles.

The tactical support ended in 1544 with the signing of the Treaty of Crépy in which the French king, who was fighting the Emperor in Italy, pledged to stop backing the Protestant princes and the League in Germany.

In 1535, Charles led the Conquest of Tunis. Francis, in an effort to limit the power of the Habsburgs, allied with Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire and formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The Italian War of 1536–38 between France and the Holy Roman Empire ended in 1538 with the Truce of Nice.

The final war during that period Charles fought against France, the Italian War of 1542–46, ended with inconclusive results and the Treaty of Crépy.

After the peace with France, Charles signed the Truce of Adrianople in 1547 with the Ottoman Empire, which was allied to Francis, to free even more Habsburg resources for a final confrontation with the League.

==Schmalkaldic War==
After Charles made peace with Francis, he focused on suppressing Protestant resistance within his empire. From 1546 to 1547, in what is known as the Schmalkaldic War, Charles and his allies fought the League over the territories of Ernestine Saxony and Albertine Saxony. Although the League&#x27;s military forces may have been superior, its leaders were incompetent and unable to agree on any definitive battle plans. Despite the fact that Pope Paul III withdrew his troops from the Imperial forces and halved his subsidy, on 24 April 1547, the imperial forces gathered by Charles routed the League&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Mühlberg, capturing many leaders, including, most notably, Johann Frederick the Magnanimous. Philip of Hesse tried to negotiate, but the emperor refused, and Philip surrendered in May. In theory, that meant that the residents of thirty different cities were returned to Catholicism, but that was not the case. The battle effectively won the war for Charles; only two cities continued to resist. Many of the princes and key reformers, such as Martin Bucer, fled to England, where they directly influenced the English Reformation.

==Aftermath==
In 1548, the victorious Charles forced the Schmalkaldic League to agree to the terms set forth in the Augsburg Interim.

A small Protestant victory in 1552 forced Charles to flee across the Alps to avoid capture; the heir Ferdinand (King of the Romans) signed the Peace of Passau, which granted some freedoms to Protestants and ended all of Charles&#x27; hopes of religious unity within his empire.

Three years later, the Peace of Augsburg granted Lutheranism official status within the Holy Roman Empire and let princes choose the official religion within the domains that they controlled, according to the principle of &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot;.

<doc id="247558" wikidata="Q1987186" url="?curid=247558" title="Spork">
<text>A spork is a form of cutlery and combination utensil taking the form of a spoon-like scoop with two to four fork-like tines. Spork-like utensils, such as the terrapin fork or ice cream fork, have been manufactured since the late 19th century; patents for spork-like designs date back to at least 1874. Sporks are commonly used by fast food restaurants, schools, prisons, militaries, backpackers, and airlines.

The word &quot;spork&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;spoon&quot; and &quot;fork&quot;. It appeared in the 1909 supplement to the &quot;Century Dictionary,&quot; where it was described as a trade name and &quot;a &#x27;portmanteau-word&#x27; applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork&quot;. The word &quot;spork&quot; was later registered as a trademark in the US and the UK.

A utensil with a fork on one end and a spoon on the other is also known as a &quot;spork&quot;.

==History==


In the U.S., patents for sporks and proto-sporks have been issued. A combined spoon, fork, and knife closely resembling the modern spork was invented by Samuel W. Francis and issued on February 3, 1874. Other early patents predating the modern spork include , for a &quot;cutting spoon&quot;, granted on November 24, 1908, to Harry L. McCoy and , for a spoon with a tined edge, granted to Frank Emmenegger in November 1912. Many of these inventions predated the use of the term &quot;spork&quot;. Given this significant prior art, the basic concept of combining aspects of a spoon and fork is well established; more modern patents have limited themselves to the specific implementation and appearance of the spork. These design patents do not prevent anyone from designing and manufacturing a different version of a spork. Examples of modern US design patents for sporks include patent number D247,153 issued in February 1978 and patent D388,664 issued in January 1998.

== Etymology ==
The &quot;word&quot; &quot;spork&quot; originated in the early 20th century to describe such devices. In 1951, Hyde W. Ballard of Westtown, Pennsylvania filed an application with the United States Patent Office (USPO; now the United States Patent and Trademark Office) to register &quot;Spork&quot; as a trademark for a combination spoon and fork made of stainless steel. The Van Brode Milling Company subsequently registered SPORK for a combination plastic spoon, fork and knife at the USPO on October 27, 1970, but the registration expired 20 years later. The word Spork accompanied by a stylised design is registered in the US in relation to hand tools, in the name of a UK-based individual.

In the UK, Plastico Limited registered &quot;Spork&quot; as a trademark in relation to cutlery with effect from September 18, 1975, (reg. no. 1052291, now expired). The trademark is also registered in the UK in relation to gardening tools in the name of the same UK based individual who owns US trademark registration no. 2514381. Another British company, Lifeventure, sells titanium and plastic versions using the name &quot;Forkspoon&quot;.

In an unsuccessful lawsuit in 1999 where the company Regalzone sought to invalidate Plastico Limited&#x27;s UK registration for Spork, Justice Neuberger wrote:
==Materials and uses==

Materials such as stainless steel, silver, aluminum, titanium, copper and polycarbonate plastic have been used in spork manufacturing. Plastic sporks are common in prisons in the United States because they are difficult to form into shiv-type weapons to attack other inmates. Prepackaged meals may come with a disposable plastic spork. Sporks are also frequently used by backpackers, Boy Scouts and other outdoorspeople as they are a lightweight and space-saving alternative to carrying both a fork and spoon.

<doc id="247566" wikidata="Q1327994" url="?curid=247566" title="Matador Records">
<text>Matador Records is an independent record label, with a roster of mainly indie rock, but also punk rock, experimental rock, alternative rock, and electronic acts.

==History==
Matador was created in 1989 by Chris Lombardi in his New York City apartment. Lombardi had brought the Austrian duo H.P. Zinker into Wharton Tiers’ Fun City studio to record Matador&#x27;s first release, &quot;...and there was light&quot;. Lombardi continued to add artists to the label&#x27;s roster, with bands like the Dustdevils, Railroad Jerk and Superchunk, before being joined by former Homestead Records manager Gerard Cosloy in 1990.

Lombardi and Cosloy have continued to run Matador Records together with Patrick Amory coming on as Matador&#x27;s label manager in 1994, later becoming label president as well as a partner of Lombardi and Cosloy. Matador first drew mainstream media attention and larger sales with the North American release of Teenage Fanclub’s debut record, &quot;A Catholic Education&quot; in 1990. Other early releases that bolstered the label included Pavement&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; in 1992 and Liz Phair&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; in 1993.

1993 also saw Matador enter into a partnership with Atlantic Records which lasted for several years. In 1996, Capitol Records purchased a 49 percent stake in Matador, which Lombardi and Cosloy bought back in 1999. Beggars Group purchased 50% of Matador in 2002 and took over the label&#x27;s worldwide marketing.

Over the years, the label has moved to larger and larger premises, and it now operates in both London and New York. Matador Europe supervises the promotion, sales and marketing of Matador titles in Europe. The London-based office has also licensed recordings from some North American artists, such as M. Ward, Sleater-Kinney, Modest Mouse, and Superchunk. The roster has grown with the label, and Matador has helped artists such as Yo La Tengo, Cat Power, Cornelius, Solex, Pizzicato Five, Helium and the Arsonists reach audiences worldwide.

In the early 2000s, Matador had to sidestep unwanted involvement in the Recording Industry Association of America dispute over peer-to-peer file sharing networks. Matador&#x27;s Patrick Amory contacted the RIAA multiple times in order to ensure that an erroneous listing on the group&#x27;s website of Matador as an RIAA member was removed. After several attempts, the name of the independent label was removed from the membership list. Despite Matador&#x27;s removal from the RIAA list, four of the label&#x27;s albums have been certified Gold for sales of at least 500,000 units by the association: &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; and &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; by Liz Phair and &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights&quot; and &quot;Antics&quot; by Interpol.

Matador acquired True Panther Sounds as an imprint in 2009. Cosloy, speaking through the Matador blog, stated that True Panther Sounds &quot;will continue to be managed by label founder Dean Bein.&quot; And that the reason Matador acquired True Panther Sounds was simply, &quot;As Victor Kiam once explained his decision to purchase the Remington Shaver operation, “I liked it so much, I bought the company.” The first joint venture by the two labels was Girls’ debut critically acclaimed release ‘Album’ and was &quot;worked through Matador’s fearsome promotional &amp; marketing machinery.&quot;

In October 2010, Matador celebrated the label&#x27;s 21st anniversary with a series of concerts at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Included amongst the performers were Pavement, Yo La Tengo, the New Pornographers, Spoon, Ted Leo &amp; the Pharmacists, Guided By Voices, Kurt Vile, Cold Cave, Fucked Up, Liz Phair, Shearwater, Superchunk, Come, Times New Viking, Belle &amp; Sebastian, Cat Power, Chavez, Perfume Genius, Harlem, and Guitar Wolf.

Matador has continued to sign bands of various genres including Iceage, Lower, Algiers, Majical Cloudz, Car Seat Headrest and Snail Mail.

<text>The Boston Blazers were a member of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League from 1989 to 1997. They were called the New England Blazers from 1989 to 1991 while based in Worcester, Massachusetts, and were renamed the Boston Blazers in 1992 when they moved to Boston. While in Worcester, the Blazers played at the Worcester Centrum. In Boston, they played at the Boston Garden from 1992–1995 and then moved to the FleetCenter in 1996 and played there until 1997.

A separate franchise, also known as the Boston Blazers, was founded in 2007 and played in the National Lacrosse League from 2009 to 2013. While the name of the new team was chosen &quot;in part due to the popularity and nostalgia associated with the former Boston Blazers franchise&quot; it did not share any lineage with the MILL Blazers.

<doc id="247577" wikidata="Q303100" url="?curid=247577" title="Graph isomorphism">
<text>In graph theory, an isomorphism of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is a bijection between the vertex sets of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;
:formula_1
such that any two vertices &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; of &quot;G&quot; are adjacent in &quot;G&quot; if and only if formula_2 and formula_3 are adjacent in &quot;H&quot;. This kind of bijection is commonly described as &quot;edge-preserving bijection&quot;, in accordance with the general notion of isomorphism being a structure-preserving bijection.

If an isomorphism exists between two graphs, then the graphs are called isomorphic and denoted as formula_4. In the case when the isomorphism is a mapping of a graph onto itself, i.e., when &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are one and the same graph, the isomorphism is called an automorphism of &quot;G&quot;.

Graph isomorphism is an equivalence relation on graphs and as such it partitions the class of all graphs into equivalence classes. A set of graphs isomorphic to each other is called an [[isomorphism class]] of graphs. The question of whether graph isomorphism can be determined in polynomial time is a major unsolved problem in computer science, known as the graph isomorphism problem.

The two graphs shown below are isomorphic, despite their different looking drawings.

==Variations==
In the above definition, graphs are understood to be undirected non-labeled non-weighted graphs. However, the notion of isomorphism may be applied to all other variants of the notion of graph, by adding the requirements to preserve the corresponding additional elements of structure: arc directions, edge weights, etc., with the following exception.

===Isomorphism of labeled graphs===
For labeled graphs, two definitions of isomorphism are in use.

Under one definition, an isomorphism is a vertex bijection which is both edge-preserving and label-preserving.

Under another definition, an isomorphism is an edge-preserving vertex bijection which preserves equivalence classes of labels, i.e., vertices with equivalent (e.g., the same) labels are mapped onto the vertices with equivalent labels and vice versa; same with edge labels.

For example, the formula_5 graph with the two vertices labelled with 1 and 2 has a single automorphism under the first definition, but under the second definition there are two auto-morphisms.

The second definition is assumed in certain situations when graphs are endowed with &quot;unique labels&quot; commonly taken from the integer range 1...,&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of the vertices of the graph, used only to uniquely identify the vertices. In such cases two labeled graphs are sometimes said to be isomorphic if the corresponding underlying unlabeled graphs are isomorphic (otherwise the definition of isomorphism would be trivial).

==Motivation==
The formal notion of &quot;isomorphism&quot;, e.g., of &quot;graph isomorphism&quot;, captures the informal notion that some objects have &quot;the same structure&quot; if one ignores individual distinctions of &quot;atomic&quot; components of objects in question. Whenever individuality of &quot;atomic&quot; components (vertices and edges, for graphs) is important for correct representation of whatever is modeled by graphs, the model is refined by imposing additional restrictions on the structure, and other mathematical objects are used: digraphs, labeled graphs, colored graphs, rooted trees and so on. The isomorphism relation may also be defined for all these generalizations of graphs: the isomorphism bijection must preserve the elements of structure which define the object type in question: arcs, labels, vertex/edge colors, the root of the rooted tree, etc.

The notion of &quot;graph isomorphism&quot; allows us to distinguish graph properties inherent to the structures of graphs themselves from properties associated with graph representations: graph drawings, data structures for graphs, graph labelings, etc. For example, if a graph has exactly one cycle, then all graphs in its isomorphism class also have exactly one cycle. On the other hand, in the common case when the vertices of a graph are (&quot;represented&quot; by) the integers 1, 2... &quot;N&quot;, then the expression
:formula_6
may be different for two isomorphic graphs.

== Whitney theorem ==
The Whitney graph isomorphism theorem, shown by Hassler Whitney, states that two connected graphs are isomorphic if and only if their line graphs are isomorphic, with a single exception: &quot;K&quot;3, the complete graph on three vertices, and the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;1,3, which are not isomorphic but both have &quot;K&quot;3 as their line graph. The Whitney graph theorem can be extended to hypergraphs.

==Recognition of graph isomorphism==
While graph isomorphism may be studied in a classical mathematical way, as exemplified by the Whitney theorem, it is recognized that it is a problem to be tackled with an algorithmic approach. The computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic is called the graph isomorphism problem.

Its practical applications include primarily cheminformatics, mathematical chemistry (identification of chemical compounds), and electronic design automation (verification of equivalence of various representations of the design of an electronic circuit).

The graph isomorphism problem is one of few standard problems in computational complexity theory belonging to NP, but not known to belong to either of its well-known (and, if P ≠ NP, disjoint) subsets: P and NP-complete. It is one of only two, out of 12 total, problems listed in whose complexity remains unresolved, the other being integer factorization. It is however known that if the problem is NP-complete then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level.

In November 2015, László Babai, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Chicago, claimed to have proven that the graph isomorphism problem is solvable in quasi-polynomial time. He published preliminary versions of these results in the proceedings of the 2016 Symposium on Theory of Computing, and of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians. In January 2017, Babai briefly retracted the quasi-polynomiality claim and stated a sub-exponential time complexity bound instead. He restored the original claim five days later. , the full journal version of Babai&#x27;s paper has not yet been published.

Its generalization, the subgraph isomorphism problem, is known to be NP-complete.

The main areas of research for the problem are design of fast algorithms and theoretical investigations of its computational complexity, both for the general problem and for special classes of graphs.

The Weisfeiler Leman graph isomorphism test can be used to heuristically test for graph isomorphism. If the test fails the two input graphs are guaranteed to be non-isomorphic. If the test succeeds the graphs may or may not be isomorphic. There are generalizations of the test algorithm that are guaranteed to detect isomorphisms, however their run time is exponential.

Another well-known algorithm for graph isomorphism is the vf2 algorithm, developed by Cordella et al. in 2001. The vf2 algorithm is a depth-first search algorithm that tries to build an isomorphism between two graphs incrementally. It uses a set of feasibility rules to prune the search space, allowing it to efficiently handle graphs with thousands of nodes. The vf2 algorithm has been widely used in various applications, such as pattern recognition, computer vision, and bioinformatics. While it has a worst-case exponential time complexity, it performs well in practice for many types of graphs.

<text>Dzong architecture is used for dzongs, a distinctive type of fortified monastery (, , ) architecture found mainly in Bhutan and Tibet. The architecture is massive in style with towering exterior walls surrounding a complex of courtyards, temples, administrative offices, and monks&#x27; accommodation.
==Characteristics==
Distinctive features include:
* High inward sloping walls of brick and stone painted white with few or no windows in the lower sections of the wall
* Use of a surrounding red ochre stripe near the top of the walls, sometimes punctuated by large gold circles
* Use of unique style flared roofs atop interior temples
* Massive entry doors made of wood and iron
* Interior courtyards and temples brightly colored in Buddhist-themed art motifs such as the ashtamangala or swastika

==Regional differences==
===Bhutan===

Dzongs serve as the religious, military, administrative, and social centers of their district. They are often the site of an annual &quot;tsechu&quot; or religious festival.

Typically half of the rooms inside a dzong serve administrative purposes (such as the office of the &quot;penlop&quot; or governor), while the other half is dedicated to religious purposes, primarily the temple and housing for monks. This division between administrative and religious functions reflects the idealized duality of power between the religious and administrative branches of government.

===Tibet===
Tibet used to be divided into 53 prefecture districts also called &quot;dzongs&quot;. There were two dzongpöns for each dzong, a lama and a layman. They were entrusted with both civil and military powers and are equal in all respects, though subordinate to the generals and the Chinese amban in military matters, until the expulsion of the ambans following the Xinhai Revolution in 1912. Today, 71 counties in the Tibet Autonomous Region are called &quot;dzong&quot;s in the Tibetic languages.

==Siting of dzongs==

Bhutanese dzong architecture reached its zenith in the 17th century under the leadership of Ngawang Namgyal, the 1st Zhabdrung Rinpoche. The Zhabdrung relied on visions and omens to site each of the dzongs. Modern military strategists would observe that the dzongs are well-sited with regard to their function as defensive fortresses. Wangdue Phodrang dzong, for instance, is set upon a spur overlooking the confluence of the Sankosh (Puna Tsang) and Tang Rivers, thus blocking any attacks by southern invaders who attempted to use a river route to bypass the trackless slopes of the middle Himalayas in attacking central Bhutan. Drukgyel Dzong at the head of the Paro valley guards the traditional Tibetan invasion path over the passes of the high Himalayas.

Dzongs were frequently built on a hilltop or mountain spur. If the dzong is built on the side of a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward into the courtyard of the main dzong below (see image at head of article).

Punakha Dzong is distinctive in that it is sited on a relatively flat spit of land at the confluence of the Mo and Pho Rivers. The rivers surround the dzong on three sides, providing protection from attack. This siting proved inauspicious, however, when in 1994 a glacial lake 90 kilometers upstream burst through its ice dam to cause a massive flood on the Pho Chhu, damaging the dzong and taking 23 lives.

==Construction==

By tradition, dzongs are constructed without the use of architectural plans. Instead construction proceeds under the direction of a high lama who establishes each dimension by means of spiritual inspiration.

Dzongs are built using corvée labor applied as a tax against each household in the district. Under this obligation each family provides or hires a decreed number of workers to work for several months at a time (during quiet periods in the agricultural year) in the construction of the dzong.

Dzongs comprise heavy masonry curtain walls surrounding one or more courtyards. The main functional spaces are usually arranged in two separate areas: the administrative offices; and the religious functions - including temples and monks&#x27; accommodation. This accommodation is arranged along the inside of the outer walls and often as a separate stone tower located centrally within the courtyard, housing the main temple, that can be used as an inner defensible citadel. The main internal structures are again built with stone (or as in domestic architecture by rammed clay blocks), and whitewashed inside and out, with a broad red ochre band at the top on the outside. The larger spaces such as the temple have massive internal timber columns and beams to create galleries around an open central full height area. Smaller structures are of elaborately carved and painted timber construction.

The roofs are massively constructed in hardwood and bamboo, highly decorated at the eaves, and are constructed traditionally without the use of nails. They are open at the eaves to provide a ventilated storage area. They were traditionally finished with timber shingles weighted down with stones; but in almost all cases this has now been replaced with corrugated galvanised iron roofing. The roof of Tongsa Dzong, illustrated, is one of the few shingle roofs to survive and was being restored in 2006/7.

The courtyards, usually stone-flagged, are generally at a higher level than the outside and approached by massive staircases and narrow defensible entrances with large wooden doors. All doors have thresholds to discourage the entrance of spirits. Temples are usually set at a level above the courtyard with further staircases up to them.

==Modern architecture in the dzong style==
Larger modern buildings in Bhutan often use the form and many of the external characteristics of dzong architecture in their construction, although incorporating modern techniques such as a concrete frame.

===University of Texas at El Paso===
The campus architecture of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is a rare example of dzong style seen outside the Himalayas. Initial phases were designed by El Paso architect Henry Trost, and later phases have continued in the same style.

In the United States, this style became known as Bhutanese Revival and Neo-Bhutanese Revival. The style was first introduced in America in 1917 by El Paso architect Charles Gibson using photographs from an article on Bhutan in the April 1914 issue of the National Geographic Magazine. Upon the suggestion of Kathleen Worrell, the wife of the dean of the State School of Mines and Metallurgy (today’s University of Texas at El Paso), Gibson’s initial designs appeared on the front page of El Paso newspapers. The governing board of the University of Texas System purchased the designs from Gibson and awarded them to the architectural firm of Trost &amp; Trost. Henry Trost, assisted by the school’s faculty, completed the final designs of four Bhutanese Revival buildings at the school’s Paso del Norte campus.

==UNESCO tentative listing==
In 2012, the Bhutanese government listed five dzongs to its tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site inscription in the future. The five dzongs are Punakha Dzong, Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Paro Dzong, Trongsa Dzong and Dagana Dzong.

<text>Delitzsch () is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Torgau-Oschatz and Muldentalkreis, the city of Leipzig, the district of Leipziger Land and the state of Saxony-Anhalt (districts Saalekreis, Anhalt-Bitterfeld and Wittenberg).

== History ==
After the 1815 Congress of Vienna Saxony had to cede large amounts of its territory to Prussia. The Prussian government established districts in the newly acquired lands, among them the district of Delitzsch.

The state of Prussia was dissolved after the end of the Nazi era, and the new state of Saxony-Anhalt was established, with Delitzsch being a part of it. In 1953 the East German government dissolved the states. They were reestablished after the German reunification in 1990, but Delitzsch and Eilenburg (two districts made up of the former Delitzsch district) were initially given to Saxony instead of Saxony-Anhalt. The two districts again merged in 1994 and formed the present borders. 

In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Delitzsch and Torgau-Oschatz were merged into the new district Nordsachsen.

== Geography ==
The district was located in the triangle between the metropolises of Leipzig, Halle and Bitterfeld. It consists of plain countryside, which is mainly agriculturally used. There is low urbanisation throughout the district. The Mulde River runs through the easternmost part of the district. On the eastern banks there is the Düben Heath (&quot;Dübener Heide&quot;), a nature park extending from here to the east and to the north.

<doc id="247580" wikidata="Q3420974" url="?curid=247580" title="Raymond Lambert">
<text>Raymond Lambert (18 October 1914 – 24 February 1997) was a Swiss mountaineer who together with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay reached an altitude of 8611 metres (just 237 metres from the summit) of Mount Everest, as part of a Swiss Expedition in May 1952. At the time it was the highest point that a climber had ever reached. There was a second Swiss expedition in autumn 1952, but a party including Lambert and Tenzing was forced to turn back at a slightly lower point. The following year Tenzing returned with Edmund Hillary to reach the summit on 29 May 1953.

==Early mountaineering==
He was born Raymond Jules Eugene Lambert in Geneva, where he made his home for his entire life. Lambert was member to a group of elite Genevois climbers. With this group, Lambert tested his skills against French, German and Italian rivals to become the first ascenders of the hardest new climbs in the Mont Blanc Range. Second ascents of the Croz Spur on the Grandes Jorasses and the North Face of the Drus (where his name is immortalised in the Fissure Lambert) put him at the forefront of international mountaineering; however, it was one climb in particular, in 1938, that gave Lambert true legendary status: a winter ascent of the Aiguilles Diables. Caught in a violent February storm, the climbing party found themselves stranded on the summit of Mont Blanc du Tacul. Lambert was the only one capable of contacting rescue. After three days sheltering in a crevasse, all of Lambert&#x27;s toes were severely frostbitten. Subsequently, all of his toes were amputated.

== On Everest ==
For more details on Lambert&#x27;s first attempt, see 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition.

Within a year after the amputation, Lambert was climbing again. His mountaineering career continued through the Second World War and in 1952 he was an obvious choice for Edouard Wyss-Dunant&#x27;s Genevois expedition to Everest. Tibet was now closed to foreigners but Nepal had just opened up. The previous year Eric Shipton&#x27;s British-New Zealand reconnaissance had climbed the Khumbu Icefall and reached the elusive Western Cwm, proving that Everest could be climbed from Nepal. Unfortunately for the British, who had enjoyed exclusive access to the mountain for 21 years, the Nepal government gave the 1952 permit to the Swiss. Building on Shipton&#x27;s experience, the Genevans reached the head of the Western Cwm and climbed the huge face above to the desolate, wind-swept plateau of the South Col. Three Swiss climbers and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay continued towards the summit, pitching a tent at 8,400m. Two returned, leaving Tenzing and Lambert, who had become firm friends, to make a summit attempt. High altitude mountaineering in 1952 was still in its infancy. Even Swiss organisation and technology were not up to the job and, apart from Tenzing, the Sherpas had little experience. Despite the best plans, Tenzing and Lambert now had to spend a night at 8,400m with no sleeping bags and no stove, producing a trickle of drinking water by melting snow over a candle. The oxygen sets were barely operable and when the two men continued in the morning, they were effectively climbing without oxygen. They struggled heroically, at times crawling on all fours, hindered by the dead weight of malfunctioning oxygen sets, finally grinding to a halt near 8595m, approximately 250m short of the summit. Assuming that George Mallory and Andrew Irvine did not reach higher in 1924, this was the highest than anyone had ever been. Lambert&#x27;s extraordinary determination was further confirmed that autumn when, alone out of the spring team, he returned for the second Swiss attempt on Everest. This time he and Tenzing were driven back from the South Col by the November jet stream winds and, to the immense relief of the British team, preparing for 1953, the Swiss admitted defeat.

== After Everest ==
Lambert returned to Nepal in 1954, trespassing across the Tibetan frontier to attempt Gaurisankar. Having failed at Gaurisankar, the expedition attempted Cho Oyu, but was turned back by high winds at about 23000 feet. Lambert returned again to Nepal in 1955 to make the first ascent with Eric Gauchat and Claude Kogan of Ganesh I (7,429m), where Gauchat died from a fall during their return. Subsequent expeditions took him to Pakistan and South America. Then in 1959 he embarked on a completely new career and by 1963, now married with two children, he was a fully qualified glacier pilot, flying to remote and inaccessible icy areas - a vocation which brought him considerable fame until he finally stopped flying in 1987. Ten years later, aged 82, Lambert died near his home in Geneva due to complications of a lung disorder.

== Honour and respect ==
John Hunt recalls meeting Raymond Lambert in 1953 to learn as much as he could about the Swiss attempt on Everest:
&quot;Despite their disappointment, the Swiss were most helpful. However, Raymond told me tactfully, `Monsieur Colonel, vous aurez gros problemes&#x27;, meaning, I think, that we hadn&#x27;t a hope in hell.&quot;
On 26 May 1953, exactly a year after Lambert&#x27;s attempt, Hunt himself photographed the skeletal remains of the tent at 8,400m. Said Hunt:
&quot;It brought home the significance of their performance and made me force myself 50m higher up the ridge, to deposit the supplies for our final camp.&quot;
Three days later Tenzing and Hillary reached the summit. On the way home, the team stopped off at Zürich airport and met the Swiss trail-blazers again. Lord Hunt recalls:
&quot;They offered us unreserved applause. In later years Raymond and I became close friends. He was not a demonstrative person, but the warmth of personality, once bestowed, was very precious to me.&quot;

<text>Hume Blake Cronyn Jr. (July 18, 1911 – June 15, 2003) was a Canadian-American actor, screenwriter and playwright. He appeared in many stage productions, television and film roles throughout his career, and garnered numerous accolades, including three Primetime Emmy Awards and two Tony Awards, as well as a nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Cronyn was the husband of actress Jessica Tandy, with whom he was presented with the Kennedy Center Honor in 1986 and National Medal of Arts in 1990. In 1999, he was awarded with a star on the Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

== Early life ==
Cronyn, one of five children, was born in London, Ontario, Canada. His father, Hume Blake Cronyn Sr., was a businessman and a Member of Parliament for London (after whom the Hume Cronyn Memorial Observatory at Western University, then known as The University of Western Ontario and asteroid (12050) &quot;Humecronyn&quot; are named). His mother, Frances Amelia (née Labatt), was an heiress of the brewing company of the same name; as the daughter of John Labatt and the granddaughter of John Kinder Labatt. Cronyn&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather, Right Reverend Benjamin Cronyn, an Anglican cleric of the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy, served as the first bishop of the Anglican diocese of Huron and founded Huron College, from which grew the University of Western Ontario.

His great-uncle, Benjamin Jr., was both a prominent citizen and early mayor of London, Ontario, but was later indicted for fraud and fled to Vermont. During his tenure in London, he built a mansion called Oakwood, which currently serves as the head office of the &quot;Info-Tech Research Group&quot;. Cronyn was also a cousin of Canadian-born theater producer, Robert Whitehead, and a first cousin of the Canadian-British artist Hugh Verschoyle Cronyn GM (1905–1996).

Cronyn was the first Elmwood School boarder in Ottawa (at the time Elmwood was called Rockliffe Preparatory School) and boarded at Elmwood between 1917 and 1921. After leaving Elmwood, Cronyn went to Ridley College in St. Catharines, and McGill University in Montreal, where he became a member of Kappa Alpha Society. Early in life, Cronyn was an amateur featherweight boxer, having the skills to be nominated for Canada&#x27;s 1932 Olympic Boxing team.

== Career ==

After graduating from Ridley College Cronyn attended McGill University, where he switched majors from pre-law to drama. He continued his acting studies thereafter under Max Reinhardt and at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1934, the same year he joined The Lambs, he made his Broadway debut as a janitor in &quot;Hipper&#x27;s Holiday&quot; and became known for his versatility, playing a number of different roles on stage. He won a Drama Desk Special Award in 1986. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

His first Hollywood film was Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943). He later appeared in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944) and worked on the screenplays of &quot;Rope&quot; (1948) and &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949). He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; (1944) and won a Tony Award for his performance as Polonius opposite Richard Burton&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1964). Cronyn bought the screenplay &quot;What Nancy Wanted&quot; from Norma Barzman, who was later blacklisted with her husband Ben Barzman, with the idea of producing the film and starring Tandy. However, he sold the screenplay to RKO which later filmed it as &quot;The Locket&quot; (1946). Cronyn also made appearances in television, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episodes &quot;Kill With Kindness&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Impromptu Murder&quot; (1958) and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; episodes &quot;Over Fifty? Steal&quot; (1970) and &quot;Odd Man In&quot; (1971).

Cronyn starred with his second wife Jessica Tandy in a short-lived (1953–1954) radio series, &quot;The Marriage&quot; (based on their earlier Broadway play, &quot;The Fourposter&quot;), playing New York attorney Ben Marriott and his wife, former fashion buyer Liz, struggling with her switch to domestic life and their raising an awkward teenage daughter (future soap opera star Denise Alexander). The show was scheduled to move from radio to television, with Cronyn producing as well as acting in the show. However, Tandy suffered a miscarriage and the show&#x27;s debut was delayed a week. The series, which was the first situation comedy broadcast in color, premiered in July 1954 to &quot;warm and enthusiastic reviews&quot;; eight episodes were aired.

The couple also appeared in many memorable dramatic stage, film and television outings, including &quot;The Seventh Cross&quot; (1944), &quot;The Green Years&quot; (1946), &quot;The Gin Game&quot; (1977), &quot;Honky Tonk Freeway&quot; (1981), &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1982), &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), the television film &quot;Foxfire&quot; (1987), &quot;*batteries not included&quot; (1987), &quot;&quot; (1988), &quot;To Dance with the White Dog (1993)&quot; and &quot;Camilla&quot; (1994).

Cronyn had an association with the Stratford Festival as a member of both the acting company and its board of governors. He played Shylock in The Merchant of Venice in 1976, and debuted his play Foxfire in 1980. The play would later move to Broadway (and won Tandy a Best Actress Tony award), and a film version was made in 1987.

In 1990 he won an Emmy award for his role in the TV Movie &quot;Age-Old Friends&quot;.
His later appearances included the films &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; (1993), &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (1996) and the Showtime TV film &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1997).

== Marriages and family ==
Cronyn&#x27;s first marriage was to the philanthropist Emily Woodruff in late 1934 or early 1935. They shared a &quot;lavender marriage&quot; and never lived together. Woodruff insisted that the marriage remain a secret because of her lesbian relationships. They quietly divorced in 1936.
Cronyn married the actress Jessica Tandy in 1942. The couple had a daughter, Tandy, and a son, Christopher. Cronyn and Tandy lived in the Bahamas, then at a lakeside estate in Pound Ridge, New York, and, finally, in Easton, Connecticut. Jessica Tandy died in 1994, aged 85, from ovarian cancer.

After he was widowed, Cronyn married author/playwright Susan Cooper (with whom he had co-written &quot;Foxfire&quot;) in July 1996. His 1991 autobiography, which covered his life and career up to the mid-1960s, was titled &quot;A Terrible Liar&quot; (). His intention to write a second volume never materialized.

== Death ==
Cronyn died on June 15, 2003, from prostate cancer aged 91.

== Honours ==
In 1979, Cronyn was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. On July 11, 1988, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada, giving him the post nominal letters &quot;OC&quot; for life.

Cronyn was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 1999. He also received the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal in 1992 and the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002.

He was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree (LLD) by the University of Western Ontario on October 26, 1974. His wife, Jessica Tandy, was given the same degree on the same day.

<text>A public lending right (PLR) is a program intended to either compensate authors for the potential loss of sales from their works being available in public libraries or as a governmental support of the arts, through support of works available in public libraries, such as books, music and artwork.

Thirty-five countries have a PLR program, and others are considering adopting one. Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, all the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, Australia, Malta and New Zealand currently have PLR programmes. There is ongoing debate in France about implementing one. There is also a move towards having a Europe-wide PLR programme administered by the European Union.

In the United States the Authors Guild began a campaign in support of the PLR in 2018.

The first PLR programme was initiated in Denmark in 1941. However, it was not properly implemented until 1946 due to World War II. The idea spread slowly from country to country and many nations&#x27; PLR programs are quite recent developments.

==National variations==
PLR programmes vary from country to country. Some, like Germany and the Netherlands, have linked PLR to copyright legislation and have made libraries liable to pay authors for every book in their collection. Other countries do not connect PLR to copyright.

In Denmark, the current programme is considered a type of governmental support of the arts, not reimbursement of potential lost sales. Types of works supported are books, music, and visual artworks, created and published in Denmark, and available in public and school libraries.
In the UK, authors Brigid Brophy and Maureen Duffy spearheaded a campaign to achieve a public lending right, following on from John Brophy&#x27;s original notion in the 1950s of &#x27;The Brophy Penny&#x27;. The UK PLR scheme was established with the Public Lending Right Act 1979 which was further expanded in 1982. It was incorporated into the British Library in 2013.

===Payments===
How amounts of payment are determined also varies from country to country. For example, in the UK, pay is based on how many times a book has been taken out of a library, while in Canada, the system of payment is based on whether a library owns a book or not.

The amount of payments is also variable. The amount any one author can receive is never very considerable. In the United Kingdom authors are paid on a per-loan basis calculated from a representative sample of libraries. The rate in 2019 was 8.52 pence per individual loan. In Canada, annual payment is based on the following equation:

where the number of libraries is counted from a national sample (number of copies in each library is irrelevant); share is the percentage contribution to the work (e.g. for books with co-authors, illustrators, translators, or narrators); and the time adjustment is 100% for the first 5 years, decreasing to 50% after 16 years, and is 0% after 25 years. The formula is applied to each title registered by the contributor. , there is a maximum of C$4,500 that any one person can receive in a year.

===Eligibility criteria===
Different countries also have differing eligibility criteria. In most nations only published works are accepted, government publications are rarely counted, nor are bibliographies or dictionaries. Some PLR services are mandated solely to fund literary works of fiction, and some such as Norway, have a sliding scale paying far less to non-fiction works. Many nations also exclude scholarly and academic texts.

==EU directive==
Within the European Union, the public lending right is regulated since November 1992 by directive 92/100/EEC on rental right and lending right. A report in 2002 from the European Commission pointed out that many member countries had failed to implement this directive correctly.

The PLR directive has met with resistance from the side of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). The IFLA has stated that the principles of &#x27;lending right&#x27; can jeopardize free access to the services of publicly accessible libraries, which is the citizen&#x27;s human right. The PLR directive and its implementation in public libraries is rejected by a number of European authors, including Nobel Laureates Dario Fo and José Saramago. Conversely, more than 3000 authors signed a petition opposing PLR cuts in the UK in 2010.

<text>The Isar () is a river in Austria and in Bavaria, Germany. Its source is in the Karwendel mountain range of the Alps. The Isar river enters Germany near Mittenwald and flows through Bad Tölz, Munich, and Landshut before reaching the Danube near Deggendorf. With 295 km length, it is among the longest rivers in Bavaria. It is Germany&#x27;s second most important tributary of the Danube.

==Etymology==
One theory is that the name &quot;Isar&quot; stems from &quot;*es&quot; or &quot;*is&quot; in the Indo-European languages, meaning &quot;flowing water&quot;, and later turned into a word with a meaning narrowed to frozen water (hence English &quot;ice&quot;, ) in Proto-Germanic. The name itself is mentioned for the first time in 763 as &quot;Isura&quot;. Related names include:

*Eisack / Isarco (Italy)
*Ésera (Spain)
*Isar (Spanish town, in the province of Burgos)
*Isauro (Italy)
*Isère (France)
*Isel (Austria)
*IJssel (Netherlands; known to Romans as &quot;Isala&quot;)
*IJzer/Yser (Belgium)
*Isonzo (Italy)
*Jizera (Czech Republic)

==Geography==

The Isar river drains a substantial part of the Bavarian Alps and parts of the Karwendel mountains.

Apart from the larger tributaries of Loisach and Amper, many smaller rivers flow into the Isar. The drainage basin contains some 9,000 square kilometers (roughly 3,500 square miles). During the winter, most of the precipitation in the Alps turns into snow. The snowmelt can result in an increased water flow down the Isar rivers during the spring meltdown. It has an average discharge at the mouth of 174 m3/s.

The official source of the Isar is located in the Hinterau valley east of the village Scharnitz in the Karwendel mountains at a height above sea level of 1160m. The Lavatschbach is the Isar&#x27;s longest headstream. A further source for the young Isar is the Birkkarbach, which has its sources in the Birkkarspitze mountain.

The Isar enters Upper Bavaria after ca. 22 km just north of Scharnitz, the Isar is dammed for the first time between Mittenwald and Krün. Some of the Isar waters are channeled via the Rißbach into the Walchensee, the Rißbach flow direction having been reversed. The Isar water flows into the giant downpipes of the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station. 200 metres lower, the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station releases water into the Kochelsee. From here, it flows into the river Loisach, Isar&#x27;s second most important tributary.

Not far down the Isar river is a large reservoir called Sylvensteinsee was created between 1954 and 1959 to make more energy generation possible and also to avoid flooding. It is located some 12 km south of Lenggries. It has prevented the flooding of Munich, for example in 1979, 1999, and most recently in 2005. At Bad Tölz, the Isar leaves the Bavarian Alps. Bad Tölz marks the river&#x27;s transit from its upper to its middle course.

The Isar river flows through a sub-alpine, glacial morainic landscape towards Wolfratshausen. Just north of the town the Loisach flows into the Isar. The Isar continues on to and through the Munich gravel plain which ends within the city limits of Munich. Further downstream, the river passes Freising, then the Amper flows into the Isar, its most important tributary, at Moosburg. This is where the lower course of the Isar river begins.

Passing Landshut, the river makes its way through the Tertiary Hills of Lower Bavaria all the way into the Danube river. The Isar river descends some 848m to flow into the Danube, about five kilometres away from Deggendorf.

==History==

Among Central European habitats, Alpine rivers are ranked among those most substantially altered by humans over the past hundred years. The Isar Rivers are now protected from development.

At the lower Isar, between Moosburg and Plattling, gold was washed from the river&#x27;s sediments during the 16th and 17th century. However, there was no big economic revenue in this due to the minor amounts of the metal found in the river. Industrialization gave rise to a sociotechnical system were the Isar River was economically exploited through multifunctional use. Over forty hydropower plants were built on the Isar to electrify Bavaria.

Following their executions on October 16, 1946, the ashes of the convicted Nazi war criminals Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hans Frank, Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Alfred Rosenberg, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Wilhelm Frick, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Fritz Sauckel, and Julius Streicher were scattered in the Isar, as were those of Hermann Göring who had committed suicide the previous night in defiance of his scheduled execution.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the federal state of Bavaria financed the construction of major hydroelectric power plants, the Sylvenstein reservoir on the Isar was constructed between 1954 and 1959.

Between 2000 and 2011, the Isarplan was implemented to reduce the risk of flooding. The planning and implementation was the responsibility of the Regional Office for Water Management and the city of Munich. Embankments were removed and the river bed was widened, establishing connections to surrounding flood plains. Riverbed rock ramps were constructed so that fish can move upstream again.

==Environmental issues==

Since the 1920s, the water of the river Isar has been used for the generation of electricity. This has had far-reaching consequences for the local fauna and flora. To provide the 28 hydroelectric power plants with enough water power the river&#x27;s water is diverted several times and almost the whole river was canalized. For example, just north of Mittenwald all the river&#x27;s water was diverted to the lake Walchensee in 1923 for the Walchensee hydroelectric plant. Since 1990, a small portion of the water, 4 cubic meters per second (roughly 1,100 U.S. gallons per second) is allowed to remain in the river Isar to prevent drought.

The construction of the Sylvenstein Dam and numerous regulations relating to the river, pushed through in the early 19th century, have strongly enhanced its character. The construction of the Sylvenstein dam has prevented the river from overflowing its banks. Lately, there have been attempts to bring the Isar river closer back to a natural character. For example, since May 2000 the river is being re-naturalized in the southern part of the river&#x27;s passage through the city of Munich. The riverbed is being widened, the banks are flattened and small gravel islands are built along with near-natural rock ramps to slow the waterflow.

Besides an improved protection against flooding the Isar river was, thus, brought into an almost natural state and this resulted in an improved quality of the recreational area within the city of Munich. The municipal wastewater treatment has also been upgraded along the river. The water pollution, however, is still relatively high. Together with other cities and communities along the river Isar, Munich has set a goal to reduce the number of germs. The sewer treatment plants on the upper river are now disinfecting the raw sewage with ultraviolet.

===Private environmental initiatives===
To preserve the beauty of the Isar valley Gabriel von Seidl founded the &quot;Isartalverein&quot; in 1902. This first civil initiative from Munich purchased 90 ha of land, and today maintains more than 330 km of hiking trails.

<doc id="247588" wikidata="Q2577599" url="?curid=247588" title="Willi Unsoeld">
<text>William Francis Unsoeld (October 5, 1926 – March 4, 1979) was an American mountaineer who was a member of the first American expedition to summit Mount Everest. The American Mount Everest Expedition was led by Norman Dyhrenfurth, and included Unsoeld, Jim Whittaker, Lute Jerstad, Barry Bishop and Tom Hornbein. Whittaker, with Sherpa Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on May 1, 1963. Unsoeld, Hornbein, Bishop and Jerstad reached the top on May 22, 1963. Unsoeld and Hornbein&#x27;s climb was the first ascent from the peak&#x27;s west ridge, and the first major traverse of a Himalayan peak. His subsequent activities included working as a U.S. Forest Service smokejumper, Peace Corps director in Nepal, speaker for Outward Bound, faculty member at Oregon State University and The Evergreen State College and mountaineering guide. He died on Mount Rainier in an avalanche.

==Early life==
Born in Arcata, California, William Francis Unsoeld was raised in Eugene, Oregon. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Oregon State College in 1951, and also studied at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Washington. He helped to create the OSC Mountain Club during his time at Oregon State University.

==Everest ascent==
In the late 1950s Unsoeld was a leading climbing guide in the Grand Teton Mountains. He climbed Mt. Rainier over 200 times.

Unsoeld and Tom Hornbein ascended Everest&#x27;s difficult West Ridge route in May 1963, on a National Geographic Society sponsored expedition while Barry Bishop and Lute Jerstad followed Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay’s South Col route established during their 1953 climb. It was the first simultaneous attempt from two directions.

The grueling expedition cost Unsoeld nine of his toes due to frostbite, and required several months of recovery in the hospital. Unsoeld and the team reunited in July 1963 when they were presented with the National Geographic Society’s highest honor, the Hubbard Medal, by John F. Kennedy.

==Later career==
Unsoeld taught religious studies at Oregon State in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

After a stint in the Peace Corps, Unsoeld joined Outward Bound and traveled about the country giving speeches and promoting the organization.

After leaving Outward Bound he became one of the founding faculty at The Evergreen State College in Washington State. He was highlighted prominently in the first recruiting video in 1971, advising that &quot;not every student should come to Evergreen&quot;.

It was at The Evergreen State College where he created an Outdoor Education Program. This program consisted of four distinct Habitat Groups, one of which was the Winter Mountaineering Group.

==Personal life==
Unsoeld married Jolene Bishoprick Unsoeld in 1951; they had two daughters and two sons. Jolene Unsoeld passed away in November, 2021, and their two sons, Krag and Regon, reside in Olympia, Washington. Their daughter Terres Unsoeld lives in California. Jolene Unsoeld served three terms in the U.S. Congress from 1989 to 1995.

In 1976, Unsoeld and his 22-year-old daughter Nanda Devi Unsoeld were on an expedition to climb her namesake mountain Nanda Devi, the second highest peak in India. His daughter died on September 7 during the climb, which was plagued by accidents and eventual tragedy. The reason for her death was blood clotting caused by the high altitude of the mountain. Asked at his home (where a picture of his daughter was displayed over the fireplace) how he could continue climbing after losing his daughter, Willi responded: &quot;What, you want me to die of a heart attack, drinking beer, eating potato chips, and watching a golf tournament on TV?&quot;

==Death==
Unsoeld died in an avalanche during an Outdoor Education Winter Expedition climb of Mount Rainier on March 4, 1979, at the age of 52. He was leading over a dozen students from The Evergreen State College on an ascent of Mount Rainier at the time. He died during the descent from their high camp in Cadaver Gap along with one student, Janie Diepenbrock from Sacramento, California.

A later analysis of the mishap, excerpts of which were published by the American Alpine Club, said in part: &quot;There are many guides who would not have taken on this particular climb with this particular group, but this is a matter of personal preference rather than a determination as to whether this climb was proper to attempt or not.&quot;

==Legacy==
Known as &quot;The Father of Experiential Education,&quot; Willi Unsoeld influenced the growth of outdoor education, inspiring educational leaders like Simon Priest. His philosophical approach to living and global perspective mentored environmental visionaries like Caril Ridley.

His philosophy focused on experiencing the sacred in nature, the importance of risk in education, and getting personal experience rather than relying on the experiences of others. His dynamic style of mentoring inspired thousands of followers. 

Why don’t you stay in the wilderness? Because that isn’t where it is at; it’s back in the city, back in downtown St. Louis, back in Los Angeles. The final test is whether your experience of the sacred in nature enables you to cope more effectively with the problems of people. If it does not enable you to cope more effectively with the problems — and sometimes it doesn’t, it sometimes sucks you right out into the wilderness and you stay there the rest of your Life – then when that happens, by my scale of value; it’s failed. You go to nature for an experience of the sacred … to re-establish your contact with the core of things, where it’s really at, in order to enable you to come back to the world of people and operate more effectively. Seek ye first the kingdom of nature, that the kingdom of man might be realized. 
Evergreen&#x27;s annual Willi Unsoeld Seminar is held as a living memorial to Unsoeld as a mountaineer, a philosopher and a theologian.

<text>The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) is an upper ontology intended as a foundation ontology for a variety of computer information processing systems. SUMO defines a hierarchy of &quot;classes&quot; and related rules and relationships. These are expressed in a version of the language SUO-KIF, a higher-order logic that has a LISP-like syntax, as well as the TPTP family of languages. A mapping from WordNet synsets to SUMO has been defined. Initially, SUMO was focused on meta-level concepts (general entities that do not belong to a specific problem domain), and thereby would lead naturally to a categorization scheme for encyclopedias. It has now been considerably expanded to include a mid-level ontology and dozens of domain ontologies.

SUMO is organized for interoperability of automated reasoning engines. To maximize compatibility, schema designers can try to assure that their naming conventions use the same meanings as SUMO for identical words (for example, &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;process&quot;). SUMO has an associated open source Sigma knowledge engineering environment.

Initially, Sumo was developed by the Teknowledge Corporation and now is maintained by Articulate Software. SUMO is open source. The first release was in December 2000.

<doc id="247609" wikidata="Q8074135" url="?curid=247609" title="Zoom (1972 TV series)">
<text>Zoom (stylized as ZOOM) is a half-hour educational television program, created almost entirely by children, that aired on PBS originally from January 9, 1972, to February 10, 1978, with reruns being shown until September 12, 1980. It was originated and produced by WGBH-TV in Boston. Inspired by educational shows like &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, but designed to give the kids who watched it a voice without adults on screen, it was, for the most part, unscripted. Far from seeking to make stars of the child performers, their contracts prohibited them from making any television appearances or doing commercials for three years after they left the show.

The show was revived in 1999 and aired on PBS until 2005.

==Premise==
A cast of seven kids (ten in Season 4) known as ZOOMers presented various activities such as games, plays, poems, recipes, jokes, movies and science experiments, all suggested by viewer contributions. These activities were introduced by such titles as ZOOMovie, ZOOM Play of the Week, ZOOMgame, ZOOMdo, ZOOMgoody, ZOOMphenomenon, etc. The cast also had informal chats on subjects such as hospitals, school, family and prejudice, titled ZOOMraps. Each episode ended with a choreographed song performed by the cast.

The ZOOMers were only identified by first names, and in the early seasons half the cast were replaced every six months, allowing a set of veteran cast members to help new members become accustomed to the show. The cast was chosen by audition, and the producers made efforts to include children of multiple cultures and backgrounds.

The mail-in request became a pop culture reference for its musical exhortation to &quot;Write &quot;ZOOM&quot;, Z-double-O-M, Box 3-5-0, Boston, Mass 0-2-1-3-4: send it to &quot;ZOOM&quot;!&quot;. The lines were mostly spoken, but the zip code was sung.

In the opening sequence, each cast member performed a brief &quot;signature move&quot;, and second season cast member Bernadette&#x27;s &quot;arm thing&quot; (a helicopter-like series of arm moves) became famous among the show&#x27;s young audience. By popular demand, Bernadette eventually explained on the show how to perform the move.

The program featured its own language, Ubbi-Dubbi, where the syllable &quot;ub&quot; was added before each vowel sound in each syllable of each word (&quot;H-ub-i, fr-ub-iends,&quot; etc.). For the first two seasons, a word game named &quot;Fannee Doolee&quot; was featured, in which a series of statements about the titular character were presented to the audience without further explanation (e.g., &quot;Fannee Doolee likes sweets, but hates candy&quot;). It was eventually revealed that Fannee Doolee loved all words with double letters and hated all words without them.

Each show had one or two ZOOMguest sequences, short film documentaries about children with special talents (singing, tap-dancing, instrument-making, etc.) or interesting hobbies or jobs. The premiere episode featured a boy who built a boat by making a ring of sticks and twigs and covering them with a tarpaulin.

Throughout the show&#x27;s run, Newton Wayland was the musical director, while Billy Wilson handled choreography during the first four seasons.

In the show&#x27;s first two seasons, Tracy hosted a &quot;Tracy Asks...&quot; sequence in which she asked a question, e.g., &quot;Which came first, the chicken or the egg?&quot; or &quot;What is the world&#x27;s longest word?&quot;, and local children were filmed giving their answers. In later episodes, other cast members hosted and the segment was retitled &quot;ZOOM in the Street&quot;. The first two seasons had &quot;quickie&quot; comedy routines modeled after &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Season 4 featured a recurring mock-soap opera titled &quot;As the World ZOOMs&quot;.

The performers in the original series were known for wearing striped rugby shirts and jeans. The cast often performed barefoot in seasons 1 and 2 but wore shoes from season 3 on.

The first &quot;ZOOM&quot; series lasted six seasons (1972–1978) and featured 49 ZOOMers. During the second and third seasons, cast members were transitioned with a catchy production number that introduced the new cast members to the continuing cast members. The same song was used for each transition (&quot;How do ya do do-dee-do, how do ya do-dee-do-dee-do, how&#x27;s your sister, how&#x27;s your brother, how are you?&quot;), based on the Woody Guthrie song &quot;Howjadoo&quot;. In the last three seasons, entirely new casts were used.

Several episodes were available with captions for the hard-of-hearing.

==Cast (in order by introduction in the opening song)==
Some PBS stations continued to broadcast reruns of the series until September 12, 1980.

==Merchandise==
In 1973, the cast members from the first season released an album titled &quot;Playgrounds&quot; (LP ) (produced by Rupert Holmes) that was available by mail order.

In 1974, A&amp;M Records released an album of songs from the show titled &quot;Come on and ZOOM&quot; (LP ; cassette ), featuring various cast members from the second season and third season. The catalogue number of the album was SP-3402 (213 402 under the PolyGram system).

In 1977, Rounder Records released &quot;ZOOM Tunes&quot;, featuring various cast members from the third season, fourth season, and fifth season. John Nagy and Newton Wayland produced the latter two albums.

Two books for children were based on the 1970s &quot;ZOOM&quot; series:
*&quot;The ZOOM Catalog&quot; (), published by Random House in 1972, was a collection of stories, poems, plays, jokes and activities from the show, featuring the second cast.
*&quot;Do a ZOOMdo&quot;, published by Little Brown in 1975, was a collection of activities from the show, featuring cast members from the second and third seasons.

On December 1, 1998, WGBH released the video-and-book set &quot;Best of the 70s&quot; and &quot;ZOOMers Revisited — Where Are They Now?&quot; ().

On October 28, 2008, WGBH released a two-DVD set, &quot;ZOOM Back to the &#x27;70s&quot;. The first DVD was a reissue of &quot;Best of the 70s&quot;, with extras consisting of behind the scenes stills set to the theme song and a 10-question quiz asking what a few of the cast members are doing today. The second DVD consisted of four episodes from the series.

<text>Alfred Hitchcock Presents is an American television anthology series created, hosted and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, airing on CBS and NBC, alternately, between 1955 and 1965. It features dramas, thrillers, and mysteries. Between 1962 and 1965, it was renamed The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. Hitchcock himself directed only 17 episodes during its run.

By the time the show premiered on October 2, 1955, Hitchcock had been directing films for over three decades. In the 21st century, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; as one of &quot;The 100 Best TV Shows of All Time&quot;. The Writers Guild of America ranked it #79 on their list of the 101 Best-Written TV Series, tying it with &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 18th on its list of 30 Best Horror TV Shows of All Time.

==History==
&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; is well known for its title sequence. The camera fades in on a simple line-drawing caricature of Hitchcock&#x27;s rotund profile (which Hitchcock drew), to the theme music of Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March of a Marionette&quot; (suggested by Hitchcock&#x27;s long-time musical collaborator Bernard Herrmann). Hitchcock appears in silhouette from the right edge of the screen, and then walks to center screen to eclipse the caricature. The caricature drawing and Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March of a Marionette&quot; have become indelibly associated with Hitchcock in popular culture.
After the title sequence, Hitchcock almost always greets his audience with, &quot;Good evening,&quot; before drolly introducing the story from an empty studio or from the set of the current episode; his usually comical monologues were written by James B. Allardice.
 At least two versions of the opening were shot for every episode. A version intended for the American audience would often spoof a recent popular commercial or poke fun at the sponsor, leading into the commercial. 

Hitchcock closed the show in much the same way as it opened, but mainly to tie up loose ends rather than joke. Frequently, a leading character in the story would have seemingly gotten away with a criminal activity. In the postscript, Hitchcock would briefly detail, usually unconvincingly, how fate (or the authorities) eventually brought the character to justice. Hitchcock told &quot;TV Guide&quot; that his reassurances that the criminal had been apprehended were &quot;a necessary gesture to morality.&quot;

&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; finished at number 6 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1956–57 season, number 12 in 1957–58, number 24 in 1958–59, and number 25 in 1959–60. The series was originally 25 minutes per episode, but it was expanded to 50 minutes in 1962 and retitled &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. Hitchcock directed 17 of the 267 filmed episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; — four during the first season and one or two per season thereafter. He directed only the fourth of the 93 50-minute episodes, entitled &quot;I Saw the Whole Thing&quot; with John Forsythe. The last new episode aired on June 26, 1965, but the series has continued to be popular in television syndication for decades, including in the UK, where it is currently being shown on Sky Arts.

==Guest stars and other actors==
Actors appearing in the most episodes include Patricia Hitchcock (Hitchcock&#x27;s daughter), Dick York, Robert Horton, James Gleason, John Williams, Robert H. Harris, Russell Collins, Barbara Baxley, Ray Teal, Percy Helton, Phyllis Thaxter, Carmen Mathews, Mildred Dunnock, Alan Napier, Robert Vaughn and Vincent Price.

Other notable directors included Robert Altman, Ida Lupino, Stuart Rosenberg, Robert Stevenson, David Swift and William Friedkin, who directed the last episode of the show.

==Broadcast history==
The broadcast history was as follows:
* Sunday at 9:30–10 p.m. on CBS: October 2, 1955 – September 1960
* Tuesday at 8:30–9 p.m. on NBC: September 1960 – September 1962
* Thursday at 10–11 p.m. on CBS: September 1962 — December 1962

* Friday at 10–11 p.m. on CBS: September 1963 – September 1964
* Monday at 10–11 p.m. on NBC: October 1964 – September 1965

==Episodes==

&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, 25 minutes long, aired weekly at 9:30 on CBS on Sunday nights from 1955 to 1960, and then at 8:30 on NBC on Tuesday nights from 1960 to 1962. It was followed by &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, which lasted for three seasons, September 1962 to June 1965, adding another 93 episodes to the 268 already produced for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;.

Two episodes that were directed by Hitchcock were nominated for Emmy Awards. The first episode was &quot;The Case of Mr. Pelham&quot; in 1955 that starred Tom Ewell while the second was &quot;Lamb to the Slaughter&quot; in 1958 that starred Barbara Bel Geddes and Harold J. Stone. In 2009 &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot; ranked &quot;Lamb to the Slaughter&quot; at #59. The third season opener &quot;The Glass Eye&quot; (1957) won an Emmy Award for director Robert Stevens. An episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; titled &quot;An Unlocked Window&quot; (1965) earned an Edgar Award for writer James Bridges in 1966.

Among the most famous episodes remains writer Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Man from the South&quot; (1960) starring Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre, in which a man bets his finger that he can start his lighter 10 times in a row. This episode was ranked #41 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. The episode was later referenced and remade in the film &quot;Four Rooms&quot;, with Quentin Tarantino directing a segment called &quot;The Man from Hollywood&quot;.

The 1962 episode &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was not aired by NBC because the sponsor felt that the ending was too gruesome. The plot has a magician&#x27;s helper performing a &quot;sawing a woman in half&quot; trick. Not knowing that the performance is meant to be an illusion, the helper actually cuts an unconscious woman in half. The episode was included in the syndication package for the series and is now considered to be in the public domain.

==Home media==
Universal Studios released the first five seasons of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Season 6 was released on November 12, 2013 via Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace program. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release on DVD-R, available exclusively through Amazon.com.

In Region 2, Universal Pictures UK has released the first three seasons on DVD, and Fabulous Films has released all seven seasons on DVD, including all three seasons of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment has released all seven seasons on DVD in Australia. They have also released all three seasons of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.

==1985 revival==

In 1985, NBC aired a new TV movie pilot based upon the series, combining four newly filmed stories with colorized footage of Hitchcock from the original series to introduce each segment. The movie was a huge ratings success. The &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; revival series debuted in the fall of 1985 and retained the same format as the pilot: newly filmed stories (a mixture of original works and updated remakes of original series episodes) with colorized introductions by Hitchcock. The new series lasted only one season before NBC cancelled it, but it was then produced for three more years by the USA Network.

==In other media==
&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; used Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March of a Marionette&quot; (1872) as its theme song. Hitchcock heard it first in F. W. Murnau&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;&quot;. When he was choosing music for his TV show, he remembered the effect Gounod&#x27;s piece had on him. It was through Hitchcock&#x27;s program that the music achieved its widest audience.

===Books===
A series of literary anthologies with the running title &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; were issued to capitalize on the success of the television series. One volume, devoted to stories that censors would not allow to be adapted for broadcast, was entitled &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories They Wouldn&#x27;t Let Me Do on TV&quot;—though eventually several of the stories collected therein &quot;were&quot; adapted.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories They Wouldn&#x27;t Let Me Do on TV&quot;. Dell, 1958.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: My Favorites in Suspense&quot;. Random House, 1959.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Baker&#x27;s Dozen of Suspense Stories&quot;. Dell, 1963.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories Not for the Nervous&quot;. Random House, 1965.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: 12 Stories for Late at Night&quot;. Dell, 1966.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories That Scared Even Me&quot;. Random House, 1967.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Month of Mysteries&quot;. Random House, 1969.
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: More Stories Not for the Nervous&quot;. Dell, 1970.

===Board Game===
*&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Why&quot;. Milton Bradley, 1958.

===LPs===
In 1958, Imperial Records released &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Music to Be Murdered By&quot;.

In 1962, Golden Records released a record album of six ghost stories for children titled &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Ghost Stories for Young People&quot;. The album opens with Charles Gounod&#x27;s theme music and is hosted by Hitchcock himself. He begins, &quot;How do you do, boys and girls? I&#x27;m delighted to find that you believe in ghosts, too. After all, they believe in you, so it is only common courtesy to return the favor.&quot;

Hitchcock introduces each of the stories, all the while recounting a droll story of his own failed attempts to deal with a leaky faucet (which at the conclusion of the album leads to Hitchcock &quot;drowning&quot; in his flooded home). The ghost stories are read by actor John Allen with minimal sound effects and music. Allen wrote four of the stories:

# &quot;The Haunted and the Haunters (The Pirate&#x27;s Curse)&quot;
# &quot;The Magician (&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part)&quot;
# &quot;Johnny Takes a Dare (The More the Merrier)&quot;
# Saki&#x27;s &quot;The Open Window&quot; (special adaptation)
# &quot;The Helpful Hitchhiker&quot;
# Walter R. Brooks&#x27; &quot;Jimmy Takes Vanishing Lessons&quot;

=== Stage musical adaptation ===

On 1 August 2024, it was announced that a stage musical adaptation of the series would have its world premiere at the Theatre Royal, Bath in March 2025, featuring music and lyrics by Steven Lutvak, book by Jay Dyer and directed by John Doyle.

==Legacy==
American rapper Eminem used the theme song in his song &quot;Alfred&#x27;s Theme&quot; from his album &quot;Music to Be Murdered By – Side B&quot; (2020), which itself is one of two albums inspired by Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 spoken-word record of the same name.
