<text>Arthur Augustus Calwell KC (28 August 1896 – 8 July 1973) was an Australian politician who served as the leader of the Labor Party from 1960 to 1967. He led the party through three federal elections, losing each one in turn.

Calwell grew up in Melbourne and attended St Joseph&#x27;s College. After leaving school, he began working as a clerk for the Victorian state government. He became involved in the labour movement as an officeholder in the public-sector trade union. Before entering parliament, Calwell held various positions in the Labor Party&#x27;s organisation wing, serving terms as state president and as a member of the federal executive. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1940 federal election, standing in the Division of Melbourne.

After the 1943 election, Calwell was elevated to cabinet as Minister for Information, overseeing government censorship and propaganda during World War II. When Ben Chifley became prime minister in 1945, Calwell was also made Minister for Immigration. He oversaw the creation of Australia&#x27;s expanded post-war immigration scheme, at the same time strictly enforcing the White Australia policy. In 1951, he was elected deputy leader of the Labor Party in place of H. V. Evatt, who had succeeded to the leadership upon Chifley&#x27;s death. The two clashed on a number of occasions over the following decade, which encompassed the 1955 party split. In 1960, Evatt retired and Calwell was chosen as his successor, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition.

Calwell and the Labor Party came close to victory at the 1961 election, gaining 15 seats and finishing only two seats shy of a majority. However, those gains were wiped out at the 1963 election. Calwell was one of the most prominent opponents of Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, a stance that was not electorally popular at the time, voting age being then 21. In 1966, Calwell survived a leadership challenge from his deputy Gough Whitlam, survived an assassination attempt with minor injuries, and finally led his party to a landslide defeat at the 1966 election, winning less than one-third of the total seats. He was 70 years old by that point, and resigned the leadership a few months later. He remained in parliament until the 1972 election, which saw Whitlam become prime minister, and died the following year.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Calwell was born on 28 August 1896, in West Melbourne. He was the oldest of seven children born to Margaret Annie (née McLoughlin) and Arthur Albert Calwell. His father worked as a police officer and retired as a superintendent of police. Calwell&#x27;s parents were both born in Australia. His maternal grandfather was Michael McLoughlin, who was born in County Laois, Ireland, and arrived in Melbourne in 1847 after jumping ship. He married Mary Murphy, who was born in County Clare. Calwell&#x27;s paternal grandfather Davis Calwell was an Irish American born in Union County, Pennsylvania, who arrived in Australia in 1853 during the Victorian gold rush. He married Elizabeth Lewis, a Welshwoman, and settled near Ballarat, eventually becoming president of the Bungaree Shire Council. Davis Calwell&#x27;s father, Daniel Calwell, had immigrated to the United States from northern Ireland, and served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in the 1820s.

===Childhood===
Calwell grew up in West Melbourne. As a young boy he contracted diphtheria, which permanently scarred his vocal chords and gave him a lifelong &quot;raspish, nasal voice&quot;. Although his father was an Anglican, Calwell was raised in his mother&#x27;s Catholic faith. He began his education at St Mary&#x27;s College, the local Mercedarian school. In 1909, he won a scholarship to St Joseph&#x27;s College, Melbourne, a Christian Brothers school. One of his closest friends at school was Matthew Beovich, a future Archbishop of Adelaide. In later life Calwell said &quot;I owe everything I have in life, under Almighty God and next to my parents, to the Christian Brothers.&quot; Calwell&#x27;s mother died in 1913, aged 40, when her oldest son was 16 and her youngest child was only three months old. His father remarried, eventually dying in 1938 at the age of 69.

==World War I==
Calwell was an officer in the Australian Army Cadets at the outbreak of World War I, and made two unsuccessful applications for a commission in the Australian Imperial Force. After his second rejection in 1916 he made no further attempts to seek active service, being unwilling to join as an enlisted man; however, he was placed in the Army Reserve and remained there until receiving an honourable discharge in 1926. Calwell joined the Young Ireland Society in 1914, and served as the organisation&#x27;s secretary until 1916. His reputation as an Irish republican brought him to the attention of the military police, which suspected him of involvement in the more radical Irish National Association. His residence was searched on one occasion, and his correspondence was routinely examined by censors. On two occasions there were moves to have him dismissed from the military for disloyalty, but Calwell denied the accusations and there was little proof that he had been actively disloyal.

==Public service career==
Calwell entered the Victorian Public Service in 1913, as a junior clerk in the Department of Agriculture. He transferred to the Department of the Treasury in 1923, where he remained until winning election to parliament in 1940. As with most of his colleagues, Calwell joined the Victorian State Service Clerical Association. He served as secretary and vice-president of that organisation, which in 1925 was reorganised into the state branch of Australian Public Service Association (a forerunner of the modern Community and Public Sector Union). He was elected as the new organisation&#x27;s inaugural president, serving until 1931.

==Early political involvement==

Calwell joined the Labor Party at about the age of 18. He was elected secretary of the Melbourne branch in 1916, and from 1917 served as one of the Clerical Association&#x27;s delegates to the state conference. He was elected to the state executive in the same year, and was state president of the party from 1930 to 1931 – at the time, the youngest person to have held the position. Calwell unsuccessfully sought Labor preselection for the Victorian Legislative Assembly and the Senate on a number of occasions, and was elected to the party&#x27;s federal executive in 1926. He was an assistant secretary to state MP Tom Tunnecliffe for a period, and from 1926 served as secretary to William Maloney, the long-serving Labor member for the federal Division of Melbourne. Maloney would remain in parliament until his death at the age of 85, and Calwell made no effort to force an early retirement, despite being widely seen as the heir apparent to the seat.

==Curtin and Chifley governments (1941–1949)==
Maloney announced he would not run for another term at the 1940 federal election. He died a month before polling day; as a result, no by-election was held in the Division of Melbourne. At the general election, Calwell easily retained the seat for the Labor Party. Due to his tenure as Victorian state president of the party and his long service as Maloney&#x27;s secretary, he was already well known in federal parliament.

During World War II, Calwell was appointed as Minister for Information in the Second Curtin Ministry following the 1943 election, and became well known for his tough attitude towards the Australian press and his strict enforcement of wartime censorship. This earned him the enmity of large sections of the Australian press, and he was dubbed &quot;Cocky&quot; Calwell by his political foes, cartoonists of the period depicting him as an obstinate Australian cockatoo.

In economic policy, Calwell was not a great advocate of nationalisation. Gough Whitlam attributed this to Calwell&#x27;s brand of socialism which was &quot;an emotion rather than an ideology, a memory of the social deprivation he observed in Melbourne during the Depression years.&quot;

===Immigration===
In 1945 when Ben Chifley succeeded Curtin, Calwell became the inaugural Minister for Immigration in the post-war Chifley government. Thus, he was the chief architect of Australia&#x27;s post-war immigration scheme at a time when many European refugees desired a better life far from their war-torn homelands, and he became famous for his relentless promotion of it. Calwell&#x27;s advocacy of the program was crucial because of his links to the trade union movement, and his skillful presentation of the need for immigration. Calwell overcame resistance to mass immigration by promoting it under the slogan &quot;populate or perish&quot;. This drew attention to the need, particularly in light of the recent war in the Pacific, to increase Australia&#x27;s industrial and military capabilities through a massive increase in the population. In July 1947 he signed an agreement with the United Nations Refugee Organisation to accept displaced persons from European countries ravaged by war. Calwell&#x27;s enthusiasm and drive in launching the migration program was a notable feature of the second term of the Chifley government, and has been named by many historians as his greatest achievement (especially given the labour movement&#x27;s hostility to earlier migration programs).

===White Australia===
Calwell was a staunch advocate of the White Australia policy. While Europeans were welcomed to Australia, Calwell attempted to deport many Malayan, Indochinese and Chinese wartime refugees, some of whom had married Australian citizens and started families in Australia. The main instrument of deportation was the &quot;War-time Refugees Removal Act 1949&quot;, which succeeded previous acts that allowed non-whites to stay in certain circumstances. Calwell&#x27;s refusal to grant entry to Lorenzo Gamboa – a Filipino man who had fought with the U.S. Army and had an Australian wife and children – caused an international incident with the Philippines. President Elpidio Quirino expressed his disappointment &quot;that our neighbour, to whom we looked for friendship, should exclude us because of our colour&quot;, and the Philippine House of Representatives passed a bill that would have excluded Australians from the country. Calwell remained unmoved, and told a rally prior to the 1949 election that &quot;I am sure we don&#x27;t want half-castes running over our country&quot; and &quot;if we let in any U.S. citizen, we will have to admit U.S. negroes. I don&#x27;t think any mothers and fathers want to see that&quot;.

==Opposition (1949–1960)==
Calwell left ministerial office from the 1949 election when the Chifley government was defeated by the Liberal Party, led by Robert Menzies. The following period in opposition was one of great frustration. Like many Labor parliamentarians and union officials at the time, Calwell was a Roman Catholic. The Australian Catholic Church was in this period fiercely anti-communist and had in the 1940s encouraged Catholic trade unionists to oppose communists within their trade unions. The organisations that co-ordinated Catholic efforts were called Industrial Groups. Calwell had originally supported the Industrial Groups in Victoria and continued to do so until the early 1950s. After Chifley&#x27;s death in 1951, H. V. Evatt became the Labor leader, and Calwell became his Deputy. Under Evatt, Labor&#x27;s attitude towards the Industrial Groups began to change, as Evatt suspected that one of their aims was to promote the Catholic element within the Labor Party.

Calwell&#x27;s friendship with many of the leaders of the Industrial Groups (known collectively as &quot;Groupers&quot;) led Evatt to privately question his loyalty. The two men thus had an increasingly difficult working relationship. This culminated in Evatt drafting and delivering the Labor Platform for the 1954 federal election without consulting Calwell. Labor was narrowly defeated at the polls, which deepened the rift between the two men.

Evatt&#x27;s subsequent public attack on the &quot;Groupers&quot; and his insistence on their expulsion from the party placed Calwell in a difficult position. He was made to choose between the Evatt-led official Labor Party and the &quot;Groupers&quot; (who were mainly Catholic and Victorian). During a specially convened Labor Conference in Hobart in May 1955, the &quot;Groupers&quot; were expelled from the Labor Party and Calwell chose to stay within the party. Calwell&#x27;s loyalty to the party was to cause him much personal and political anguish: he lost many of its oldest friends at this time, including the Archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix, and was, for a time, denied Communion at his parish church.

Ironically, this loyalty to the party did not prevent him from being deeply distrusted by the left-wing of the ALP, especially in his home state of Victoria. For many years, he had a stormy relationship with the state Labor Party. He never favoured the communist philosophy and was eloquent in his attacks on communists, whom he once called, &quot;Pathological exhibits... human scum... paranoiacs, degenerates, morons, bludgers... pack of dingoes... industrial outlaws and political lepers... ratbags. If these people went to Russia, Stalin wouldn&#x27;t even use them for manure.&quot;

==Leader of the Opposition (1960–1967)==
Evatt retired in 1960, and Calwell was acting leader before he succeeded him as Leader of the Australian Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition, with Gough Whitlam as his deputy. Calwell very nearly defeated Menzies at the 1961 federal election, owing to widespread discontent at Menzies&#x27; deflationary economic policies, as well as the unprecedented (and temporary) endorsement of the ALP by the usually pro-Liberal &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. It is generally accepted that unfavourable Democratic Labor preferences were the primary reason why Labor came up two seats short of toppling the Coalition despite winning an 18-seat swing and a majority of the two-party vote. Ultimately, a narrow loss in Bruce, located in the DLP&#x27;s heartland of Melbourne, ended any realistic chance of a Labor win, but the Coalition was not assured of another term in government until the Brisbane-area seat of Moreton was called for the Liberals hours later. Labor actually won 62 seats, the same as the Coalition. However, two of those seats were in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, and members from the territories then did not count for purposes of forming a government.

After this, however, Menzies was able to exploit divisions in the ALP over foreign policy and state aid for Catholic schools to recover his position. Calwell opposed the use of Australian troops in Malaya and the establishment of American military communications bases in Australia. He also upheld the traditional Labor policy of denying state aid to private schools.

At the 1963 election, Calwell hoped to build on his gains from two years earlier, but was severely damaged by a picture in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that showed him and Whitlam outside a Canberra hotel, waiting for word from Labor&#x27;s Federal Conference as to the policies upon which they should fight the election.

In an accompanying story, Alan Reid of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; wrote that Labor was ruled by &quot;36 faceless men&quot;. The Liberals seized on it, issuing a leaflet accusing Calwell of taking direction from &quot;36 unknown men, not elected to Parliament nor responsible to the people.&quot; At the election, Labor suffered a 10-seat swing. Many thought that Calwell should retire, but he was determined to stay and fight.

Calwell made his strongest stand with his vehement opposition to Australia&#x27;s military involvement in the Vietnam War and the introduction of conscription to provide troops for the war, publicly saying that &quot;a vote for Menzies was a blood vote&quot;. Unfortunately for Calwell, the war was initially very popular in Australia and continued to be so after Menzies retired in 1966. Menzies&#x27; successor, Harold Holt, seized on this and fought the 1966 election on the Vietnam issue. Labor suffered a crushing defeat, losing nine seats while the Coalition won the largest majority government in Australian history at the time.

It was clear by this time that Calwell&#x27;s awkward, tactless image was no match for that of his charismatic and ambitious young Deputy Leader, the urbane, middle-class, university-educated Whitlam. In particular, Whitlam&#x27;s clear mastery of the media gave him a huge advantage over Calwell, who looked and sounded substantially older than his 70 years. Calwell, an old-fashioned stump orator whose career was forged in the days of the raucous public meeting, had always come across badly on television, compared with the smooth, avuncular and rich-voiced Menzies and the suave Holt. Calwell was also regarded by 1966 as an aged relic of the Great Depression era. He was still campaigning about socialism and nationalisation, and continued to defend the White Australia policy. Calwell resigned as Labor leader two months after the election, in January 1967; Whitlam succeeded him.

===Attempted assassination===
Calwell was only the second victim of an attempted political assassination in Australia (the first being Prince Alfred in 1868). On 21 June 1966, Calwell addressed an anti-conscription rally at Mosman Town Hall in Sydney. As he was leaving the meeting, and just as his car was about to drive off, a 19-year-old student named Peter Kocan approached the passenger side of the vehicle and fired a sawn-off rifle at Calwell at point-blank range. However, the closed window deflected the bullet, which lodged harmlessly in his coat lapel, and he sustained only minor facial injuries from broken glass. Reflecting his Catholic values, Calwell later forgave and visited Kocan in the mental hospital (where he was confined for ten years), and through a regular correspondence encouraged his eventual rehabilitation.

==Later life and death==

By the time Calwell&#x27;s political career ended he was the Father of the House of Representatives, having served as an MP for 32 years. He was frequently critical of Whitlam, especially since he knew that Whitlam intended abandoning the White Australia policy.

At the 1972 election which brought Whitlam to the prime ministership, Calwell retired from Parliament. After a period of slow deterioration in his health, and a nearly four week stint in hospital, Calwell died on 8 July 1973. He was given a state funeral at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, and was buried at Melbourne General Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Elizabeth and his daughter Mary Elizabeth.

Notwithstanding Calwell&#x27;s poor relations with the conservative press in Australia and his public battles against right-wing Catholics like Archbishop Mannix and B. A. Santamaria, he maintained a cordial relationship with Menzies. Menzies, for his part, never lost his respect and outright personal liking for Calwell. He attended Calwell&#x27;s funeral, but (according to his biographer Allan W. Martin) became so overwhelmed by grief after arriving at the cathedral that he was unable to compose himself and leave his car.

==Personal life==
Calwell&#x27;s first marriage was to Margaret Mary Murphy in 1921. She died the following year in 1922, and ten years later, on 29 August 1932, he married Elizabeth (Bessie) Marren, a strong-willed, intelligent and well-read Irishwoman who was social editor (as &quot;Cecilia&quot;) of the Catholic weekly newspaper, the &quot;Tribune&quot;. In 1933 they launched the &quot;Irish Review&quot; as the official organ of the Victorian Irish Association. Calwell had met Elizabeth at Irish language classes run by the Gaelic League in Melbourne, and retained an interest in and fluency in the language.

Calwell and his second wife had two children, Mary Elizabeth (b. 1934) and Arthur Andrew (b. 1937). His son, known as Art, died of leukaemia in June 1948 at the age of eleven. Calwell was profoundly affected by his son&#x27;s death, and subsequently wore only black neckties. His wife later recalled it as &quot;the cruellest blow Arthur has ever suffered. In fact, he has never been the same since that dreadful day&quot;. Calwell&#x27;s daughter was described by &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; in 1995 as his &quot;most passionate defender and admirer&quot;. In 2013, she published a sympathetic biography of her father titled &quot;I Am Bound to Be True&quot;, hoping to &quot;correct what she believes is the maligning of his legacy&quot;.

Outside of the political arena, Calwell was a devotee of the North Melbourne Football Club and was the first life member of the club. He was always devoted to the Roman Catholic Church despite his many conflicts with church leaders. He was made a Knight Commander with Star of the Order of St Gregory the Great (KC*SG) by Pope Paul VI (following nomination by Australian cardinal Martin Toal) for his lifelong service to the church. This was despite much of the local hostility to Calwell by some Catholic bishops, who supported the splinter Democratic Labor Party.

==Racial views==
Calwell&#x27;s remark in parliament in 1947 that &quot;two Wongs don&#x27;t make a White&quot; was widely reported at the time, both in Australia and overseas. This statement is widely quoted as evidence of Calwell&#x27;s racism. The remark referenced to a Chinese resident called Wong who was wrongly threatened with deportation, and a Liberal MP, Thomas White, the Member for Balaclava, in addition to being a wordplay on the saying &quot;two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right&quot;. According to Hansard, Calwell said &quot;there are many Wongs in the Chinese community, but I have to say — and I am sure that the honorable Member for Balaclava will not mind doing so — that &#x27;two Wongs do not make a White.

In his autobiography, Calwell said it was intended as a &quot;jocose remark&quot;, and that it had been &quot;so often misrepresented it has become tiresome&quot;. He attributed this to the press, stating that &quot;because of some anti-Australian Asian journalist or perhaps because some Australian pressman with a chip on his shoulder, a Labor Party hater, the name of White was deliberately altered into a definition of colour&quot;.

In his final year in parliament, Calwell made several statements regarding non-white immigration to Australia. In March 1972 he publicly endorsed British Conservative MP Enoch Powell&#x27;s views on race, later describing the United Kingdom as having experienced a &quot;black tragedy&quot;. In May 1972, in response to comments from customs minister Don Chipp supporting a multi-racial society, Calwell released a statement strongly opposing non-white migration to Australia, stating that he was &quot;appalled&quot; at the thought and was &quot;opposed to the creation of a chocolate-coloured Australia&quot;. In a subsequent interview with &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, he stated that non-white migrants would lower community living standards as they &quot;live on the smell of an oily rag and breed like flies&quot;.

Calwell believed himself to be free of personal prejudice against people of other races while believing that they should exist in separation. This is reflected by Calwell&#x27;s comments in his 1972 memoirs &quot;Be Just and Fear Not&quot; in which he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:

I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatise the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.

Speaking regarding the incident involving Lorenzo Gamboa, when a questioner brought up his U.S. citizenship for consideration, Calwell responded &quot;If we let in any U.S. citizen we will have to admit U.S. negroes. I don&#x27;t think any mothers and fathers want to see that.&quot;

In 1948, Calwell announced that no Japanese war brides would be allowed to settle in Australia, stating &quot;it would be the grossest act of public indecency to permit any Japanese of either sex to pollute Australia&quot; while relatives of deceased Australian soldiers were alive.

Of Indigenous Australians, Calwell wrote: &quot;If any people are homeless in Australia today, it is the Aboriginals. They are the only non-European descended people to whom we owe any debt. Some day, I hope, we will do justice to them.&quot;

<doc id="251528" wikidata="Q146502" url="?curid=251528" title="Lijepa naša domovino">
<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Croatia. Often simply referred to as &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;Our Beautiful&#x27;) in Croatia, it is a phrase widely used as a metonym for the country.

== History ==
The original lyrics were written by Antun Mihanović and first published under the title &quot;Horvatska domovina&quot; (&#x27;Croatian Homeland&#x27;) in 1835. In 1846, Josip Runjanin (1821–1878) composed the music for &quot;Horvatska domovina&quot;. Runjanin&#x27;s army bandmaster Josip Wendl adapted his music for a military brass orchestra. The original form of the melody is unknown because the original has not been recovered to this day.

The song was scored and harmonized for a male choir by a teacher and organist of the Zagreb Cathedral Vatroslav Lichtenegger in 1861, and after that it started to be performed as the Croats&#x27; ethnic anthem. The title &quot;Lijepa naša&quot; has been applied since that time. The original text has 14 verses. Since then, a few minor adjustments have been made to the lyrics.

The song was not immediately adopted by the Croatian Parliament as the national anthem. In 1907, the Association of Croatian Singing Clubs requested the parliament to do so but received no response, even though the song was used as the state anthem in unofficial capacity at ceremonies, including the 29 October 1918 session of parliament when Croatia formally dissolved its ties with Austria-Hungary.

Between 1918 and 1941, segments of the Croatian national anthem were part of the national anthem of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and it was unofficial hymn of Croats. During the World War II, in the Independent State of Croatia it was also used as state anthem, albeit with some modifications to the lyrics. Croatian Partisans were also using it, for example during ZAVNOH sessions.

The song officially became the state anthem of Croatia through amendments of the Constitution of Croatia adopted by the parliament of the SR Croatia on 29 February 1972. It was confirmed by constitutions of 1974 and 1990, when its lyrics were slightly modified, and by the Coat of Arms, Flag, and National Anthem of the Republic of Croatia Act.

== Lyrics ==
=== Current official ===
On most occasions, only the first verse is performed.
===Original poem===

The poem first published in the cultural magazine &quot;Danica ilirska&quot;, No. 10, edited by Ljudevit Gaj, in 1835 originally consisted of fourteen verses but today, only verses one, two, thirteen, and fourteen are part of the national anthem.

<text>Battleships is the international title of a video game based on the classic board game. The object is to sink the opponent&#x27;s entire fleet (six ships) without him sinking the player&#x27;s fleet first.

This version of the game had the particularity of allowing fire by salvos of up to 24 shots, depending on the number of unsunk ships the player had. After all shots were placed by the player, a scene showing a ship firing its guns at the enemy fleet was played, showing hits and damage. The game could be played in Hotseat, since each player&#x27;s fleet placement was never shown after the game had started proper.

There also have been other versions of the battleship game for various consoles and handheld devices, including &quot;Battleship&quot;.

<doc id="251534" wikidata="Q241588" url="?curid=251534" title="Middle class">
<text>The middle class refers to a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy, often defined by occupation, income, education, or social status. The term has historically been associated with modernity, capitalism and political debate. Common definitions for the middle class range from the middle fifth of individuals on a nation&#x27;s income ladder, to everyone but the poorest and wealthiest 20%. Theories like &quot;Paradox of Interest&quot; use decile groups and wealth distribution data to determine the size and wealth share of the middle class.

Terminology differs in the United States, where the term &quot;middle class&quot; describes people who in other countries would be described as working class. There has been significant global middle-class growth over time. In February 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; asserted that over half of the world&#x27;s population belonged to the middle class, as a result of rapid growth in emerging countries. It characterized the middle class as having a reasonable amount of discretionary income and defined it as beginning at the point where people have roughly a third of their income left for discretionary spending after paying for basic food and shelter.

==History and evolution of the term==
The term &quot;middle class&quot; is first attested in James Bradshaw&#x27;s 1745 pamphlet &quot;Scheme to prevent running Irish Wools to France.&quot; Another phrase used in early modern Europe was &quot;the middling sort&quot;.

The term &quot;middle class&quot; has had several and sometimes contradictory meanings. Friedrich Engels saw the category as an intermediate social class between the nobility and the peasantry in late-feudalist society. While the nobility owned much of the countryside, and the peasantry worked it, a new &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; (literally &quot;town-dwellers&quot;) arose around mercantile functions in the city. In France, the middle classes helped drive the French Revolution. This &quot;middle class&quot; eventually overthrew the ruling monarchists of feudal society, thus becoming the new ruling class or bourgeoisie in the new capitalist-dominated societies.

The modern usage of the term &quot;middle-class&quot;, however, dates to the 1913 UK Registrar-General&#x27;s report, in which the statistician T. H. C. Stevenson identified the middle class as those falling between the upper-class and the working-class. The middle class includes: professionals, managers, and senior civil servants. The chief defining characteristic of membership in the middle-class is control of significant human capital while still being under the dominion of the elite upper class, who control much of the financial and legal capital in the world.

Within capitalism, &quot;middle-class&quot; initially referred to the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;; later, with the further differentiation of classes as capitalist societies developed, the term came to be synonymous with the term &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot;. The boom-and-bust cycles of capitalist economies result in the periodic (and more or less temporary) impoverishment and proletarianization of much of the &quot;petite bourgeois&quot; world, resulting in their moving back and forth between working-class and petite-bourgeois status. The typical modern definitions of &quot;middle class&quot; tend to ignore the fact that the classical petite-bourgeoisie is and has always been the owner of a small-to medium-sized business whose income is derived almost exclusively from the employment of workers; &quot;middle class&quot; came to refer to the combination of the labour aristocracy, professionals, and salaried, white-collar workers.

The size of the middle class depends on how it is defined, whether by education, wealth, environment of upbringing, social network, manners or values, etc. These are all related, but are far from deterministically dependent. The following factors are often ascribed in the literature on this topic to a &quot;middle class:&quot;

* Achievement of tertiary education.
* Holding professional qualifications, including academics, lawyers, chartered engineers, politicians, and doctors, regardless of leisure or wealth.
* Belief in &quot;bourgeois&quot; values, such as high rates of house ownership, delayed gratification, and jobs that are perceived to be secure.
* Lifestyle. In the United Kingdom, social status has historically been linked less directly to wealth than in the United States, and has also been judged by such characteristics as accent (Received Pronunciation and U and non-U English), manners, type of school attended (state or private school), occupation, and the class of a person&#x27;s family, circle of friends and acquaintances.

In the United States, by the end of the twentieth century, more people identified themselves as middle-class (with insignificant numbers identifying themselves as upper-class). The Labour Party in the UK, which grew out of the organised labour movement and originally drew almost all of its support from the working-class, reinvented itself under Tony Blair in the 1990s as &quot;New Labour&quot;, a party competing with the Conservative Party for the votes of the middle-class as well as those of the Labour Party&#x27;s traditional group of voters – the working-class. Around 40% of British people consider themselves to be middle class, and this number has remained relatively stable over the last few decades.

According to the OECD, the middle class refers to households with income between 75% and 200% of the median national income.

==Marxism==
Marxism defines social classes according to their relationship with the means of production. The main basis of social class division of Marxism: the possession of means of production, the role and position it plays in social labor organization (production process), the distribution of wealth and resources and the amount. Marxist writers have used the term middle class in various ways. In the first sense, it is used for the bourgeoisie (the urban merchant and professional class) that arose between the aristocracy and the proletariat in the waning years of feudalism in the Marxist model. Vladimir Lenin stated that the &quot;peasantry ... in Russia constitute eight- or nine-tenths of the petty bourgeoisie&quot;. However, in modern developed countries, Marxist writers define the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; as primarily comprising (as the name implies) owners of small to medium-sized businesses, who derive their income from the exploitation of wage-laborers (and who are in turn exploited by the &quot;big&quot; bourgeoisie i.e. bankers, owners of large corporate trusts, etc.) as well as the highly educated professional class of doctors, engineers, architects, lawyers, university professors, salaried middle-management of capitalist enterprises of all sizes, etc. – as the &quot;middle class&quot; which stands between the ruling capitalist &quot;owners of the means of production&quot; and the working class (whose income is derived solely from hourly wages).

Louis C. Fraina (Lewis Corey), a pioneer 20th-century American Marxist theoretician, defined the middle class as &quot;the class of independent small enterprisers, owners of productive property from which a livelihood is derived&quot;. From Fraina&#x27;s perspective, this social category included &quot;propertied farmers&quot; but not propertyless tenant farmers. Middle class also included salaried managerial and supervisory employees but not &quot;the masses of propertyless, dependent salaried employees. Fraina speculated that the entire category of salaried employees might be adequately described as a &quot;new middle class&quot; in economic terms, although this remained a social grouping in which &quot;most of whose members are a new proletariat.&quot;

==Professional–managerial class==
In 1977, Barbara Ehrenreich and John Ehrenreich defined a new class in the United States as &quot;salaried mental workers who do not own the means of production and whose major function in the social division of labor ... [is] ... the reproduction of capitalist culture and capitalist class relations;&quot; the Ehrenreichs named this group the &quot;professional–managerial class&quot;. This group of middle-class professionals is distinguished from other social classes by their training and education (typically business qualifications and university degrees), with example occupations including academics and teachers, social workers, engineers, accountants, managers, nurses, and middle-level administrators. The Ehrenreichs developed their definition from studies by André Gorz, Serge Mallet, and others, of a &quot;new working class,&quot; which, despite education and a perception of themselves as middle class, were part of the working class because they did not own the means of production, and were wage earners paid to produce a piece of capital. The professional–managerial class seek higher rank status and salaries and tend to have incomes above the average for their country.

==Recent global growth==
Modern definitions of the term &quot;middle class&quot; are often politically motivated and vary according to the exigencies of political purpose which they were conceived to serve in the first place as well as due to the multiplicity of more- or less-scientific methods used to measure and compare wealth between modern advanced industrial states, where poverty is relatively low and the distribution of wealth more egalitarian in a relative sense, and in developing countries, where poverty and a profoundly unequal distribution of wealth crush the vast majority of the population. Many of these methods of comparison have been harshly criticised; for example, economist Thomas Piketty, in his book &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot;, describes one of the most commonly used comparative measures of wealth across the globe, the Gini coefficient, as being an example of &quot;synthetic indices ... which mix very different things, such as inequality with respect to labor and capital, so that it is impossible to distinguish clearly among the multiple dimensions of inequality and the various mechanisms at work.&quot;

In February 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; asserted that over half the world&#x27;s population now belongs to the middle class, as a result of rapid growth in emerging countries. It characterized the middle class as having a reasonable amount of discretionary income, so that they do not live from hand-to-mouth as the poor do, and defined it as beginning at the point where people have roughly a third of their income left for discretionary spending after paying for basic food and shelter. This allows people to buy consumer goods, improve their health care, and provide for their children&#x27;s education. Most of the emerging middle class consists of people who are middle class by the standards of the developing world but not the developed one, since their money incomes do not match developed country levels, but the percentage of it which is discretionary does. By this definition, the number of middle-class people in Asia exceeded that in the West sometime around 2007 or 2008.

&quot;The Economist&quot; article pointed out that in many emerging countries, the middle class has not grown incrementally but explosively. The point at which the poor start entering the middle class by the millions is alleged to be the time when poor countries get the maximum benefit from cheap labour through international trade, before they price themselves out of world markets for cheap goods. It is also a period of rapid urbanization, when subsistence farmers abandon marginal farms to work in factories, resulting in a several-fold increase in their economic productivity before their wages catch up to international levels. That stage was reached in China sometime between 1990 and 2005, when the Chinese &quot;middle class&quot; grew from 15% to 62% of the population and is just being reached in India now.

&quot;The Economist&quot; predicted that surge across the poverty line should continue for a couple of decades and the global middle class will grow exponentially between now and 2030. Based on the rapid growth, scholars expect the global middle class to be the driving force for sustainable development. This assumption, however, is contested (see below).

As the American middle class is estimated by some researchers to comprise approximately 45% of the population, &quot;The Economist&quot; article would put the size of the American middle class below the world average. This difference is due to the extreme difference in definitions between &quot;The Economist&quot; and many other models.

In 2010, a working paper by the OECD asserted that 1.8 billion people were now members of the global &quot;middle class&quot;. Credit Suisse&#x27;s Global Wealth Report 2014, released in October 2014, estimated that one billion adults belonged to the &quot;middle class,&quot; with wealth anywhere between the range of $10,000–$100,000.

According to a study carried out by the Pew Research Center, a combined 16% of the world&#x27;s population in 2011 were &quot;upper-middle income&quot; and &quot;upper income&quot;.

An April 2019 OECD report said that the millennial generation is being pushed out of the middle class throughout the Western world.

===China===
Since the beginning of the 21st century, China&#x27;s middle class has grown by significant margins. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, by 2013, some 420 million people, or 31%, of the Chinese population qualified as middle class. Based on the World Bank definition of middle class as those having with daily spending between $10 and $50 per day, nearly 40% of the Chinese population were considered middle class as of 2017.

China&#x27;s middle class represents a significant market force with effects extending beyond its borders. The promise of increased prosperity and a consumer society has been a driving force behind this growth, while also suggesting the potential for political changes similar to those seen in Europe and North America. However, it&#x27;s important to note that the Chinese middle class differs substantially from its Western counterparts. Despite its growth, it remains a relatively small group profoundly joined with the Chinese state. This unique relationship challenges assumptions about its role in political change. Criticisms from this demographic often center on improving efficiency and social justice within the existing political framework, rather than advocating for a regime change.

===India===
Estimates vary widely on the number of middle-class people in India. A 1983 article put the Indian middle class as somewhere between 70 and 100 million. According to one study the middle class in India stood at between 60 and 80 million by 1990. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, 78 million of India&#x27;s population are considered middle class as of 2017, if defined using the cutoff of those making more than $10 per day, a standard used by the India&#x27;s National Council of Applied Economic Research. If including those with incomes between $2 and $10 per day, the number increases to 604 million. This was termed by researchers as the &quot;new middle class&quot;. Measures considered include geography, lifestyle, income, and education. The World Inequality Report in 2018 further concluded that elites (i.e. the top 10%) are accumulating wealth at a greater rate than the middle class, that rather than growing, India&#x27;s middle class may be shrinking in size.

===Africa===
According to a 2014 study by Standard Bank economist Simon Freemantle, a total of 15.3 million households in 11 surveyed nations of Africa are middle class: Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. In South Africa, a report conducted by the Institute for Race Relations in 2015 estimated that between 10% and 20% of South Africans are middle class, based on various criteria. An earlier study estimated that in 2008 21.3% of South Africans were members of the middle class.

A study by EIU Canback indicates 90% of Africans fall below an income of $10 a day. The proportion of Africans in the $10–$20 middle class (excluding South Africa), rose from 4.4% to only 6.2% between 2004 and 2014. Over the same period, the proportion of &quot;upper middle class&quot; income ($20–$50 a day) went from 1.4% to 2.3%.

According to a 2014 study by the German Development Institute, the middle class of Sub-Saharan Africa rose from 14 million to 31 million people between 1990 and 2010.

===Latin America===
Over the years estimates on the size of the Latin America&#x27;s middle class have varied. A 1960 study stated that the middle strata in Latin America as a whole, exclusive of Indians, constituted just under 20% of the national society. A 1964 study estimated that 45 million Latin Americans belonged to the urban middle class while 15 million to the urban well-to-do and 8 million to the rural middle class and well-to-do. In Brazil, according to one estimate, in 1970 the lower middle class comprised 12% of the population, while the upper middle class comprised 3%. In the mid-1970s it was estimated by one authority that the Brazilian middle class comprised between 15 and 25% of the population. A 1969 economic survey estimated that 15% of Brazilians belonged to the middle class. By 1970, according to one study, the middle class of Argentina comprised 38% of the economically active population, compared with 19% in Brazil and 24% in Mexico. A 1975 study on Mexico estimated that the middle class in 1968 (defined as families earning between 2,000 and 5,000 pesos annually) comprised 36.4% of the population, while the upper class (defined as families earning over 5,000 pesos annually) comprised 9.4% of the population and the lower class (defined as families earning less than 2,000 pesos annually) comprised 53.9% of the population.

According to a study by the World Bank, the number of Latin Americans who are middle class rose from 103 million to 152 million between 2003 and 2009.

===Russia===
In 2012, the &quot;middle class&quot; in Russia was estimated as 15% of the whole population. Due to sustainable growth, the pre-crisis level was exceeded. In 2015, research from the Russian Academy of Sciences estimated that around 15% of the Russian population are &quot;firmly middle class&quot;, while around another 25% are &quot;on the periphery&quot;.

<text>Louis Carl Heinrich Friedrich Paschen (22 January 1865 – 25 February 1947) was a German physicist, known for his work on electrical discharges. He is also known for the Paschen series, a series of hydrogen spectral lines in the infrared region that he first observed in 1908. He established the now widely used Paschen curve in his article &quot;Über die zum Funkenübergang in Luft, Wasserstoff und Kohlensäure bei verschiedenen Drücken erforderliche Potentialdifferenz&quot;. He is known for the Paschen-Back effect, which is the Zeeman effect&#x27;s becoming non-linear at high magnetic field. He helped explain the hollow cathode effect in 1916.

==Life==
Paschen was born in Schwerin, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. From 1884 to 1888 he studied at the universities of Berlin and Strassburg, after which he became an assistant at the Academy of Münster. He became a professor at the Technische Hochschule Hannover in 1893 and professor of physics at the University of Tübingen in 1901. He served as president of the Physikalisch-Technischen Reichsanstalt from 1924–33 and an honorary professor of the University of Berlin in 1925.

During the second world war he had the Chinese scientist He Zehui to stay at his house and she became like a daughter to him. With his help she was introduced to Walther Bothe who led the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Heidelberg.

Paschen taught in Berlin until his death in Potsdam in 1947. He is buried at the Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery.

<text>The private sector is the part of the economy which is owned by private groups, usually as a means of establishment for profit or non profit, rather than being owned by the government.

==Employment==
The private sector employs most of the workforce in some countries. In private sector, activities are guided by the motive to earn money, i.e. operate by capitalist standards.

A 2013 study by the International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) identified that 90 percent of jobs in developing countries are in the private sector.

==Diversification==
In free enterprise countries, such as the United States, the private sector is wider, and the state places fewer constraints on firms. In countries with more government authority, such as China, the public sector makes up most of the economy.

== Regulation ==
States legally regulate the private sector. Businesses operating within a country must comply with the laws in that country. In some cases, usually involving multinational corporations that can pick and choose their suppliers and locations based on their perception of the regulatory environment, local state regulations have resulted in uneven practices within one company. For example, workers in one country may benefit from strong labour unions, while workers in another country have very weak laws supporting labour unions, even though they work for the same employer. In some cases, industries and individual businesses choose self-regulation by applying higher standards for dealing with their workers, customers, or the environment than the minimum that is legally required of them.

There can be negative effects from the private sector. In the early 1980s, the Corrections Corporation of America pioneered the idea of running prisons for a profit. Today, corporate-run prisons hold eight percent of America&#x27;s inmates. Since it is from the private sector, their main priority is not rehabilitation, but profit. This has resulted in many human rights violations across the United States.

<doc id="251541" wikidata="Q7258882" url="?curid=251541" title="Puffin crossing">
<text>A puffin crossing (its name derived from the phrase &quot;pedestrian user-friendly intelligent&quot;) is a type of pedestrian crossing in use in the United Kingdom.

The design is distinct from the older pelican crossing in that the lights signalling to the pedestrians are on the same side of the road as the pedestrian, rather than across the road. From 2016, pelican crossings began to be phased out in the United Kingdom, to be replaced with puffin crossings.

They have two sensors on top of the traffic lights (pedestrian crossing detector; PCD, and pedestrian kerb detector; PKD). These sensors detect if pedestrians are crossing slowly and can hold the red traffic light longer if needed. If a pedestrian presses the button but then walks off, the PKD will cancel the request making the lights more efficient.

==Function==
Unlike the older pelican crossing designs, where the pedestrian signal lights are mounted on the opposite side of the road, the puffin crossing has them mounted at the near road side, set diagonally to the road edge. This allows the pedestrian to monitor passing traffic while waiting for the signal to cross. A second reason for the design is that having the lights closer to the user assists visually impaired people who could have difficulty viewing the signal from across the carriageway.

Some push-button units (the lower box in the image) are also fitted with a tactile knob under the unit which rotates when the user may cross. This feature is to assist visually impaired people who struggle to see the light change.

After a request to cross (by button press), a kerb side detector monitors the pedestrian&#x27;s presence at the crossing. Should the pedestrian cross prematurely, walk away from the crossing, or wait outside the detection area, the pedestrian&#x27;s request to cross could be automatically cancelled. This is so traffic is not halted unnecessarily. An on-crossing detector ensures that the signal for vehicles remains red until pedestrians have finished crossing (within practical limits). Unlike the pelican crossing, there is no transitional &quot;flashing&quot; phase.

The pedestrian phase will start at the moment all three of these conditions are fulfilled:
* the pedestrian push button has been pressed since the end of the last pedestrian phase
* the &quot;Maximum Traffic Green Timer&quot; has expired
* the detectors indicate that a pedestrian is still waiting to cross

The &quot;Maximum Traffic Green Timer&quot; is started either when the pedestrian push button is pressed or when the traffic signals first turn green after the previous pedestrian phase. The latter arrangement is termed the &quot;pre-timed Maximum Facility&quot;.

===Concerns===
Concerns have been expressed that Puffin crossings may be less safe than Pelican crossings due to the nearside indicator not being visible while crossing, and being at a different focal length, reducing traffic awareness. The indicator box itself also blocks the view of the road completely for shorter pedestrians due to being installed at head height. However, a 2005 study commissioned by the DfT found that Puffins were safer than Pelican crossings with fewer pedestrian accidents and fewer involving cars,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.roadsafetygb.org.uk/news/2170.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; despite confusing pedestrians.

In 2014, Transport for London announced that they would stop installing Puffins, saying that &quot;Pedestrians have previously indicated to us that they dislike the uncertainty of not knowing whether the &#x27;green man&#x27; is still lit once they have started crossing, which happens with nearside signals.&quot; Birmingham City Council also said that year that they would not be installing low level indicators at busy city centre crossings, expressing concern that the pedestrian indicator could be obscured by crowds.

<doc id="251542" wikidata="Q2341687" url="?curid=251542" title="Bow Street Runners">
<text>The Bow Street Runners were the law enforcement officers of the Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court in the City of Westminster. They have been called London&#x27;s first professional police force. The force originally numbered six men and was founded in 1749 by magistrate Henry Fielding, who was also well known as an author. His assistant, brother, and successor as magistrate, John Fielding, moulded the constables into a professional and effective force. &quot;Bow Street Runners&quot; was the public&#x27;s nickname for the officers although the officers did not use the term themselves and considered it derogatory. The group was disbanded in 1839 and its personnel merged with the Metropolitan Police, which had been formed ten years earlier but the London metropolitan detective bureau trace their origins back from there.

==Policing before 1749==
The Bow Street Runners are considered the first British police force. Before the force was founded, the law enforcing system was in the hands of private citizens and single individuals with very little intervention from the state. A police force like the Maréchaussée already present in France would have been ill-suited to Britain, which saw examples such as the French one as a threat to their liberty and balanced constitution in favour of an arbitrary and tyrannical government. The enforcement of the law then was mostly up to the private citizens, who had the right and duty to prosecute crimes in which they were involved or in which they were not. At the cry of &#x27;murder!&#x27; or &#x27;stop thief!&#x27; everyone was entitled and obliged to join the pursuit. Once the criminal had been apprehended, the parish constables and night watchmen, who were the only public figures provided by the state and who were typically part-time and local, would make the arrest.

As a result, the state set a reward to encourage citizens to arrest and prosecute offenders. The first of such rewards was established in 1692 of the amount of £40 for the conviction of a highwayman and in the following years it was extended to burglars, coiners and other forms of offence. The reward was to be increased in 1720 when, after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession and the consequent rise of criminal offences, the government offered £100 for the conviction of a highwayman. Although the offer of such a reward was conceived as an incentive for the victims of an offence to proceed to the prosecution and to bring criminals to justice, the efforts of the government also increased the number of private and unofficial thief-takers, who would solve petty crime for a fee.

Thief-takers became infamously known not so much for what they were supposed to do, catching real criminals and prosecuting them, as for &quot;setting themselves up as intermediaries between victims and their attackers, extracting payments for the return of stolen goods and using the threat of prosecution to keep offenders in thrall&quot;. Some of them, such as Jonathan Wild, became infamous at the time for staging robberies in order to receive the reward.

==History==
===Origins===

Magistrate Henry Fielding decided to regulate, regularise, formalise and legalise the thief-takers&#x27; activity due to high rates of corruption and mistaken or malicious arrests, therefore creating the Bow Street Runners. His Runners were not dissimilar to the thief-takers, but differed from them in their formal attachment to the Bow Street magistrates&#x27; office and in being paid by the magistrate with funds from central government. They worked out of Fielding&#x27;s office and court at No. 4 Bow Street, and did not patrol but served writs and arrested offenders on the authority of the magistrates, travelling nationwide to apprehend criminals.

Henry Fielding&#x27;s work was carried on by his brother Justice John Fielding, who succeeded him as magistrate in the Bow Street office. Under John Fielding, the institution of the Bow Street Runners gained more and more recognition from the government, although the force was only funded intermittently in the years that followed. It served as the guiding principle for the way that policing developed over the next 80 years. Bow Street was a manifestation of the move towards increasing professionalisation and state control of street life, beginning in London.

===Henry Fielding (1750–1754)===
Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle turned to Henry Fielding for help. Fielding had become a Westminster magistrate in 1748 and in his house in Bow Street, Covent Garden, he had started a kind of magisterial work that was different from anything that had been done before. Taking up the legacy of his predecessor, Sir Thomas de Veil, Fielding turned Bow Street into a court-like setting in which to conduct examinations.

However, his reformed method was not limited to his magisterial activity in Bow Street; it was also extended outside of the magistrate&#x27;s office. In fact, since 1749–50 Henry Fielding had begun organising a group of men with the task of apprehending offenders and taking them to Bow Street for examination and commitment to trial. Such an organised intervention was needed, according to Fielding, because of the difficulties and reluctance of private citizens to apprehend criminals, especially if those were part of a gang — reluctance largely caused by the fear of retaliation and by the extremely high costs of the prosecution that would have to be paid by the victim of the crime. This activity, however, was very similar to the thief-takers&#x27; enterprise and, as such, it could have been considered as corrupt as the latter. Therefore, Fielding wrote a number of pamphlets to justify the activity of thief-taking; he argued that the legitimacy of this activity had been undermined by the actions of a few (see for example Jonathan Wild) and that, in fact, thief-takers performed a public service where the civil authorities were weaker. Another step towards the legitimation of the activity of the Bow Street Runners concerned the lawfulness of an arrest made by an ordinary citizen. Fielding made clear that constables were not the only ones to have the right to make an arrest, but under special circumstances – such as with a warrant issued by a magistrate – also private citizens could act against a suspected criminal and arrest them.

Another problem that Fielding had to face was that of the economic support of the Runners; without any direct funding from the government, the men at Fielding&#x27;s service were left relying on the rewards issued by the state after an offender&#x27;s conviction and by private citizens in order to retrieve their stolen goods. It is also true that many of the original Runners were also serving constables, so they were financially supported by the state. Nevertheless, the problem persisted and, in 1753, Fielding&#x27;s initiative came close to failing when his men had stopped their thief-taking activity for some time. A way out of this situation came in the same year, when the government lamented spending too much money on rewards with no apparent decrease in the crime rates. At this point, the Duke of Newcastle, the secretary of state at the time, asked Fielding for advice, which he presently gave. The document that Fielding presented to the government revolved around the activity of the Bow Street officers; Fielding&#x27;s suggestion included that he be given more money in addition to his own magistrate&#x27;s stipend for two main purposes. The first was, of course, to offer economic support to the officers working in Bow Street, which would have allowed these men to extend their policing activities well beyond the simple thief-taking. The other purpose was to advertise the activity of the Bow Street office and to encourage private citizens to report crimes and provide information about offenders; the advertisements would be published in the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot;, a paper in which, as some critics have pointed out, the Fielding brothers had a financial interest.

In late 1753, the government approved Fielding&#x27;s proposal and established an annual subvention of £200, that allowed Fielding not only to support the advertisement and the Bow Street officers but also to maintain a stable group of clerks who kept detailed records of their activities. A new kind of magistrate&#x27;s office and policing activity was therefore established; after the death of Henry Fielding in 1754, it was carried on by his brother John, who had overseen the whole project and was to further expand and develop it over the following years.

===Sir John&#x27;s Runners (1754–1780)===

When Henry Fielding died in 1754, he was succeeded as Magistrate by his brother Sir John Fielding, who had previously been his assistant for four years. Known as the &quot;Blind Beak of Bow Street&quot;, John Fielding refined the patrol into the first truly effective police force for the capital, later adding officers mounted on horseback, and remained chief magistrate of Westminster until his death in 1780.

As soon as he was appointed, John Fielding examined the activity of the Bow Street office and the issues that needed to be addressed; the financial contribution from the state was still in place, so his pamphlet focused mainly on the need to tackle violence and highway robbery in particular. At the beginning, Fielding shared his office with Saunders Welch, an energetic former grocer elected High Constable of Holborn. Eventually, the government agreed to establish a separate magistrate office from which Welch could operate, leaving Fielding as the dominant presence in Bow Street. Over the years, the government subvention raised from the initial £200 to £400 in 1757 and to £600 by 1765, as Fielding managed to persuade the Duke of Newcastle, now First Lord of the Treasury, of the increasing costs of an active policing and advertising, as well as of the need of recruiting a permanent clerical staff for the office. The administration of the funds was left largely in Fielding&#x27;s hands. He provided payments to six officers, for investigating and attempting to apprehend offenders, and occasionally to a few assistants.

During John Fielding&#x27;s time as a magistrate, the Bow Street office seems to have been open for most of the day and for most days of the week, even when Fielding was not himself in the office, and there was always a so-called &#x27;ordinary&#x27; to whom one could report offences also during the night-time. One of the main activities carried out by clerks and assistants in the office was to collect and record information about offences and offenders, therefore creating a sort of criminal database that could turn useful to officers in their investigating activities. Fielding believed that a national system of criminal information circulating throughout not only the metropolis of London but also the entire country would ensure that offenders would be arrested and brought to justice; moreover, anyone contemplating an offence would be deterred from doing so.

In addition, he introduced innovations at the Bow Street office that would have a great effect on the first procedures of criminal prosecution. Fielding created a court-like setting that could attract and accommodate a large audience for his examinations of suspected offenders, opened and available for the public for long and regular hours. In doing so, he turned the office from being the mere house of a magistrate to being the Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court in which several justices were employed in rotation in order to keep the office open for long hours every day. This process of transformation was further amplified by Fielding&#x27;s success in encouraging the London press to attend and provide their readers with a weekly report on his activity.

===John Fielding&#x27;s legacy (1780–1815)===
Just after John Fielding&#x27;s death in 1780, the crisis of the administration of criminal law renewed itself, primarily for three different factors. The first was the rise in crime rates because the end of a period of war (in this case the American Revolution) and the consequent return in the country of many soldiers and sailors, who were now out of a job. The second factor was directly linked to the first and concerned the issue of transportation to the American colonies, which had been established in 1718 and begun the principal sanction imposed on convicted felons. The loss of the American territories resulted in convicts piling up in inadequate jails, as they continued to be sentenced to transportation, without an actual destination. The government was forced to find either an alternative destination for convicts sentenced to transportation or an alternative sanction. The third factor concerned the events that took place in London in June 1780, known as the Gordon Riots during which the authorities lost control of the streets of the city. Those events highlighted the weakness of London policing and magisterial system.

The government responded by establishing the Home Department in 1782, therefore allowing the administration of criminal law to receive more focused attention than before. In time, this office would provide a centre to deal with all the aspects of criminal administration. In 1782 it also supported the new Bow Street Foot Patrols. Eventually, in 1785, the Home Department attempted to introduce and pass ″&quot;A Bill for the further Prevention of Crimes, and for the more speedy Detection and Punishment of Offenders against the Peace, in the Cities of London and Westminster, the Borough of Southwark, and certain Parts adjacent to them&quot;″, which was meant to provide a measure of central control over the many police forces across the metropolis but failed to do so. Some elements were derived from the existing institutions, particularly Bow Street, but the concept of the metropolis as a unified district and a central command overseeing many policing divisions was completely new. 
In addition to the reform of the structure of the London policing forces, the bill included clauses aimed at the prevention of crime, such as giving police preventive powers to search and arrested on suspicion. An example is when they arrest Colonel Edward Despard, for provoking the Despard Plot. In 1792, Parliament did pass legislation that introduced some reform to the system, the (32 Geo. 3. c. 53) which contained two elements of the 1785 bill: one was the establishment of public offices where magistrates monopolized the administration of criminal law throughout the metropolis, and the other was the increase in the powers of the police. The act was mainly based on the model presented by the Bow Street office and on Fielding&#x27;s conception of the magistrate and of how to deal with crime, therefore leading to the replication of the Bow Street structure throughout London.

Under the new legislation, the Bow Street office maintained a privileged position among the other offices of the metropolis, due to the closer relationship of its magistrates with the Home Office and to the financial resources at their disposal, regulated by an informal agreement with the Treasury rather than by legislation, therefore increasing the policing resources available. This made it possible for the government to use the Runners and the patrolmen as they thought necessary, increasing their range of investigation, that now included more engagement with threats to national security and social disorder, as can be seen by the fewer and fewer accounts of Runners giving evidence in trials at the Old Bailey.

===The Runners&#x27; last years (1815–1839)===
In the new century, crime rates diminished in the metropolis, therefore the contribution of the Runners to the policing of property offences decreased considerably; they continued to investigate offences in London, but not as actively as they had before. Their incomes from London crime diminished as the position that Bow Street had once held in the commitment of felons to trial continued to erode with the expansion of the patrol and the creation of new police offices from 1792. By the early 1820s, Bow Street was responsible for just over 10% of the accused felons being committed to trial at the Old Bailey. After 1815, the Runners&#x27; most regular employment was to respond to help requests from prosecutors outside London. These were likely cases in which their skill and experience was thought to be useful in investigating offences in the provinces.

After the Metropolitan Police Act 1829, which established the Metropolitan Police, the policing responsibilities of the Bow Street magistrates were very considerably diminished. The Bow Street patrol was gradually absorbed into the new police force and Bow Street was left with only the Runners. Even then, the Home Office held much of the authority over the activity of the Runners and was mainly concerned to bring Bow Street&#x27;s finances under control. The Bow Street magistrates&#x27; effective loss of authority over the activity of the Runners and the government&#x27;s concern to control costs meant that the funds for the office were much diminished in the 1830s.

In 1834, a parliamentary committee recommended that the Bow Street men and constables should be incorporated with the Metropolitan Police as soon as possible and, although this report was not enforced, their conclusions were taken up and expanded by another committee in 1837. The reports of these committees were enacted into law as a renewal of the Police Act in 1839 and, in doing so, made the Runners at Bow Street redundant.

==Policing activity==
Bow Street&#x27;s involvement in a case began quite simply with the arrival of a victim or a messenger who wanted to report a crime. This was encouraged by the promise of a reward to the messenger (usually a shilling) and of a paid advertisement in one or more papers of the stolen goods. Fielding believed strongly in the importance of a rapid spread of information and therefore advertising was very important to his policing strategy. Of course, this included also the advertising of the activity carried out in Bow Street, as well as exhortations to victims to report offences and any kind of information on criminals and stolen goods.

In case of robbery or other serious offences, Bow Street officers were immediately involved and dispatched. The success of their detection work and of the apprehension of offenders relied on the rapid collection and communication of information about the crime committed and on the descriptions of the offenders. Officers could go out on their own initiative to investigate an offence, as essentially they were hired by the victims to give them help. Most victims were expected to pay the expenses of the investigation and to offer a small reward for information as well. They would also have to face the expenses of an eventual trial, even though if the offender was convicted they would have had the right to receive financial compensation from the court.

Later, as a response to the numerous reports of attacks by footpads and highwaymen, Fielding decided to send some men to patrol the squares of Westminster and the highways leading into the city, also on horseback from 1756, though by 1766–67 horseback patrolling had been sharply curtailed, due to the excessive costs. Nevertheless, two &#x27;pursuit horses&#x27; were maintained to send officers to patrol roads from time to time. The patrol activity of the Bow Street officers is an indicator of a fundamental characteristic of the Bow Street policing system, which is its undefined geographical range. In fact, the officers were not restricted to a particular area of the city but were able to operate across the entire metropolis, and also beyond London itself. To facilitate the reach of the office, Fielding was named in the commissions of the peace of Kent, Essex and Surrey, in addition to those of Middlesex and Westminster. That meant that the Bow Street officers did not have to seek the assistance of local magistrates in the counties surrounding London in order to make an arrest or carry out a search. Otherwise, they would have had to seek such assistance, although in practice there was not any impediment to their working wherever their enquiries took them, as some accounts from 1756 show that they pursued suspects into Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and even to Bristol.

Fielding&#x27;s policing system relied very much on the information provided by informants, to whom were directed the many pamphlets and advertisements published by the Bow Street office. Turnpike gatekeepers and publicans were therefore encouraged to report crimes and offences as soon as possible to Bow Street, in order to allow Fielding&#x27;s men to presently seek out and apprehend the offenders.

<doc id="251547" wikidata="Q1427950" url="?curid=251547" title="Scotland Act 1998">
<text>The Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which legislated for the establishment of the devolved Scottish Parliament with tax varying powers and the Scottish Government (then Scottish Executive). It was one of the most significant constitutional pieces of legislation to be passed by the UK Parliament between the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 and the European Union (Withdrawal) Act in 2018 and is the most significant piece of legislation to affect Scotland since the Acts of Union in 1707 which ratified the Treaty of Union and led to the disbandment of the Parliament of Scotland.

==Content and history==
The Act was introduced by the Labour government in 1998 to give effect to the Scottish devolution referendum in 1997 which showed that Scotland was in favour of both of the set questions, firstly for the creation of a parliament for Scotland and secondly, that this parliament should have tax varying powers. The Act creates the Scottish Parliament, sets out how Members of the Scottish Parliament are to be elected, makes some provision about the internal operation of the Parliament (although many issues are left for the Parliament itself to regulate) and sets out the process for the Parliament to consider and pass Bills which become Acts of the Scottish Parliament once they receive royal assent. The Act specifically declares the continued power of the UK Parliament to legislate in respect of Scotland; thereby upholding the concept of Westminster&#x27;s absolute parliamentary sovereignty.

The Act also provides for the creation of a &#x27;Scottish Executive&#x27; though one of the early actions of the SNP administration that won power in the 2007 elections was to rebrand the Scottish Executive, as the group of Ministers and their civil servants had been known, as the Scottish Government. Despite the re-branding, the &#x27;Scottish Executive&#x27; still uses the original description for a number of purposes (s.44 of the Scotland Act defines the nature of the body but does not use the words &quot;shall be known as&quot; with regard to a name as is the case with various other bodies whose names are thus fixed by statute). It consists of a First Minister and other Ministers appointed by the Monarch with the approval of the Parliament, including the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.

The Act sets out the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. Rather than listing the matters over which the Scottish Parliament does control (devolved powers), it specifies the matters over which it does not (reserved matters). It further designates a list of statutes which are not amenable to amendment or repeal by the Parliament which includes the Human Rights Act 1998 and many provisions of the Scotland Act itself. Even when acting within its legislative competence, the Act further constrains the powers of the Parliament by inhibiting it from acting in a manner incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights or European Community law. The same constraints apply to acts of the Scottish Executive.

The Act grants the Secretary of State for Scotland power to direct the Scottish Government not to take any action which he has reasonable grounds to believe &quot;would be incompatible with any international obligations&quot; or to act where he believes such action &quot;is required for the purpose of giving effect to any such obligations&quot;.

The Act also sets up mechanisms to resolve disputes over questions about legislative competence of the Parliament and powers of the Executive. The ultimate appeal in such matters lies to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (prior to 1 October 2009, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council). The Westminster government can unilaterally prohibit an Act of the Scottish Parliament — even if legislatively competent — from receiving royal assent if it believes the law would affect matters of reserved law; this provision has been only used once, to veto the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill in 2023.

The Act also allows the powers of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive to be adjusted over time by agreement between both parliaments by means of an Order in Council.

The Act was passed on 17 November 1998, and received royal assent two days later on 19 November. The first elections were held in May 1999 and the Scottish Parliament and Executive assumed their full powers on 1 July 1999.

==Amendments to the Act==
The Act was amended by the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004 to end the link between the number of MPs at Westminster and the number of constituency MSPs. It was amended again in 2016 as a reaction to the 2014 Scottish Independence vote.

The Wales Act 2014 made amendments to Part 4A of the Scotland Act around the definition of a Scottish taxpayer, to ensure that an individual could not be a taxpayer in both Scotland and Wales in the same year.

The Act has been amended by:
*Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004
*Constitutional Reform Act 2005 
*Scotland Act 2012
*Wales Act 2014
*Scotland Act 2016
*European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018

<doc id="251548" wikidata="Q155581" url="?curid=251548" title="Wenceslaus II of Bohemia">
<text>Wenceslaus II Přemyslid (; ; 27 September 1271 – 21 June 1305) was King of Bohemia (1278–1305), Duke of Cracow (1291–1305), and King of Poland (1296–1305).

He was the only son of King Ottokar II of Bohemia and Ottokar&#x27;s second wife Kunigunda. He was born in 1271, ten years after the marriage of his parents. Kunigunda was the daughter of Rostislav Mikhailovich, lord of Slavonia, son of a Grand Prince of Kiev, and Anna of Hungary, daughter of Béla IV of Hungary. His great-grandfather was the German king Philip of Swabia. Wenceslaus II was the grandfather of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV. He was a member of the Přemyslid dynasty.

==Early years==
In 1276 Rudolf I, King of the Romans, placed Ottokar under the ban of the empire and besieged Vienna. This compelled Ottokar in November 1276 to sign a new treaty by which he gave up all claims to Austria and the neighbouring duchies, retaining for himself only Bohemia and Moravia. Wenceslaus was then betrothed to Rudolf&#x27;s daughter Judith, creating an uneasy peace. Wenceslaus&#x27;s father died on 26 August 1278 in the Battle on the Marchfeld shortly before Wenceslaus&#x27; seventh birthday.

Before Wenceslaus became of age, the government was handled by Otto V, Margrave of Brandenburg, who is said to have held Wenceslaus captive in several locations. He returned to Bohemia in 1283, at the age of twelve. His mother&#x27;s second husband, Záviš of Falkenstein, ruled instead of him for a few years.

On 24 January 1285, Wenceslaus married Judith of Habsburg, daughter of Rudolf I, to whom he had been betrothed since 1276. In 1290, Wenceslaus had Záviš beheaded for alleged treason and began ruling independently.

==Polish kingship==

In 1291, High Duke Przemysł II of Poland ceded the sovereign Duchy of Kraków to Wenceslaus. Kraków was associated with the overlordship of Poland, but Przemysł held the other duchies and in 1295 was crowned king. After Przemysł&#x27;s death in 1296, Wenceslaus became overlord of Poland and in 1300, and had himself crowned its king.

==Silver in Kutná Hora==
In 1298, silver was discovered at Kuttenberg (now Kutná Hora) in Central Bohemia. Wenceslaus took control of the mine by making silver production a royal monopoly and issued the Prague groschen, which became the most popular of the early Groschen-type coins. Kutná Hora was one of the richest European silver strikes ever: between 1300 and 1340 the mine may have produced as much as 20 tons of silver a year.

In 1300, Wenceslaus issued the new royal mining code &quot;Ius regale montanorum&quot;. This was a legal document that specified all administrative as well as technical terms and conditions necessary for the operation of mines.

==The Crown of Hungary and death==

Queen Judith died in 1297. Wenceslaus&#x27; second wife was Elisabeth Richeza, daughter of King Przemysl II of Poland (1295–1296).

In 1301, Wenceslaus&#x27; kinsman Andrew III of Hungary died and the Árpád dynasty became extinct in the male line. Wenceslaus was one of the relatives who claimed the throne, and he accepted it from a party of Hungarians on behalf of his young son, betrothed to Andrew&#x27;s only child, Elizabeth. On 27 August 1301, his son was crowned in Székesfehérvár as king of Hungary.

At that time the Kingdom of Hungary was split into several de facto principalities, and young Wenceslaus was only accepted as the King of Hungary by the rulers in Upper Hungary (Matthew III Csák), West-Transdanubia in modern-day Burgenland and West-Transdanubia, (where the Güssings Kőszegi (Croatian: &quot;Gisingovci&quot;) family were their strongest supporters, and on territory around the capital, Buda. But the Abas and Matthew Csák switched sides in 1303 and started to support Wenceslaus&#x27; rival Charles Robert of Anjou. Consequently, the young Wenceslaus, in Ofen (Buda), became afraid and wrote to his father in Prague for help. His father took a large army and invaded Buda, but having considered the situation, he took his son and the Hungarian crown and returned to Bohemia (1304). Ivan Kőszegi was named to represent Wenceslaus III in Hungary.

Wenceslaus II died on 21 June 1305, at the age of 33, probably of tuberculosis. He was succeeded by his son, Wenceslaus III, the last of the Přemyslid kings.

==Review of government of Wenceslaus II==
Wenceslaus II is considered one of the most important Czech kings. He built a great empire stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Danube river and established numerous cities, such as Plzeň in 1295. He won for his family three royal crowns (Bohemia, Hungary and Poland). The Kingdom of Bohemia was the largest producer of silver in Europe in his time. He created Prague Groschen, which was an important European currency for centuries.

During his reign, there was great urban development. He planned to build the first university in Central Europe. The power and wealth of the Kingdom of Bohemia gave rise to great respect, but also to the hostility of European royal families. His son King Wenceslaus III was unable to maintain a mighty empire, and soon after the untimely death of Wenceslaus II, his empire began to crumble.

==Family==

In 1285 in Eger (Cheb), he married the German Princess Judith of Habsburg (1271–1297), daughter of King Rudolf I of Germany and his wife Gertrude of Hohenberg. She died shortly after their 10th child was born:
* Přemysl Otakar (6 May 1288 – 19 November 1288).
* Wenceslaus III (6 October 1289 – 4 August 1306); King of Bohemia, King of Hungary and King of Poland.
* Agnes (6 October 1289 – soon after 6 August 1296), twin of Wenceslaus; married in 1296 to Rupert, eldest surviving son of German King Adolf of Nassau.
* Anne (10 October 1290 – 3 September 1313), married in 1306 to Henry of Carinthia.
* Elisabeth (20 January 1292 – 28 September 1330), married in 1310 to John of Luxembourg.
* Judith (3 March 1293 – 3 August 1294).
* John (26 February 1294 – 1 March 1295).
* John (21 February 1295 – 6 December 1296).
* Margaret (21 February 1296 – 8 April 1322), married in 1308 to Bolesław III the Generous, Duke of Wrocław.
* Judith (born and died 21 May 1297).
In 1303, he married the Princess Elisabeth Richeza of Poland (1286–1335), daughter of Przemysł II, King of Poland. They had one child:
* Agnes (25 June 1305 – before 4 January 1337), married to Henry I, Duke of Jawor.

Wenceslaus also had numerous illegitimate children, including Jan Volek (?? – 27 September 1351), bishop of Olomouc, and possibly Elizabeth, Abbess of Pustiměřu.

<doc id="251549" wikidata="Q5255370" url="?curid=251549" title="Deming regression">
<text>In statistics, Deming regression, named after W. Edwards Deming, is an errors-in-variables model that tries to find the line of best fit for a two-dimensional data set. It differs from the simple linear regression in that it accounts for errors in observations on both the &quot;x&quot;- and the &quot;y&quot;- axis. It is a special case of total least squares, which allows for any number of predictors and a more complicated error structure.

Deming regression is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation of an errors-in-variables model in which the errors for the two variables are assumed to be independent and normally distributed, and the ratio of their variances, denoted &quot;δ&quot;, is known. In practice, this ratio might be estimated from related data-sources; however the regression procedure takes no account for possible errors in estimating this ratio.

The Deming regression is only slightly more difficult to compute than the simple linear regression. Most statistical software packages used in clinical chemistry offer Deming regression.

The model was originally introduced by who considered the case &quot;δ&quot; = 1, and then more generally by with arbitrary &quot;δ&quot;. However their ideas remained largely unnoticed for more than 50 years, until they were revived by and later propagated even more by . The latter book became so popular in clinical chemistry and related fields that the method was even dubbed &quot;Deming regression&quot; in those fields.

== Specification ==

Assume that the available data (&quot;yi&quot;, &quot;xi&quot;) are measured observations of the &quot;true&quot; values (&quot;yi*&quot;, &quot;xi*&quot;), which lie on the regression line:
: formula_1
where errors &quot;ε&quot; and &quot;η&quot; are independent and the ratio of their variances is assumed to be known:
: formula_2

In practice, the variances of the formula_3 and formula_4 parameters are often unknown, which complicates the estimate of formula_5. Note that when the measurement method for formula_3 and formula_4 is the same, these variances are likely to be equal, so formula_8 for this case.

We seek to find the line of &quot;best fit&quot; 
: formula_9
such that the weighted sum of squared residuals of the model is minimized:
: formula_10

See for a full derivation. 
== Solution ==
The solution can be expressed in terms of the second-degree sample moments. That is, we first calculate the following quantities (all sums go from &quot;i&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot;):
:formula_11

Finally, the least-squares estimates of model&#x27;s parameters will be
: formula_12

==Orthogonal regression==
For the case of equal error variances, i.e., when formula_13, Deming regression becomes orthogonal regression: it minimizes the sum of squared perpendicular distances from the data points to the regression line. In this case, denote each observation as a point formula_14 in the complex plane (i.e., the point formula_15 where formula_16 is the imaginary unit). Denote as formula_17 the sum of the squared differences of the data points from the centroid formula_18 (also denoted in complex coordinates), which is the point whose horizontal and vertical locations are the averages of those of the data points. Then:

*If formula_19, then every line through the centroid is a line of best orthogonal fit.
*If formula_20, the orthogonal regression line goes through the centroid and is parallel to the vector from the origin to formula_21.

A trigonometric representation of the orthogonal regression line was given by Coolidge in 1913.

===Application===

In the case of three non-collinear points in the plane, the triangle with these points as its vertices has a unique Steiner inellipse that is tangent to the triangle&#x27;s sides at their midpoints. The major axis of this ellipse falls on the orthogonal regression line for the three vertices. The quantification of a biological cell&#x27;s intrinsic cellular noise can be quantified upon applying Deming regression to the observed behavior of a two reporter synthetic biological circuit.

When humans are asked to draw a linear regression on a scatterplot by guessing, their answers are closer to orthogonal regression than to ordinary least squares regression.

== York regression ==
The York regression extends Deming regression by allowing correlated errors in x and y.

<text>&quot;They think it&#x27;s all over&quot; is a quote from Kenneth Wolstenholme&#x27;s BBC TV commentary in the closing moments of the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, when England beat West Germany 4–2 after extra time to win the FIFA World Cup. In the final few seconds of the match, Wolstenholme said:

:&quot;And here comes Hurst! He&#x27;s got...&quot; 
:: (Wolstenholme is distracted by some of the crowd spilling onto the pitch)
:&quot;Some people are on the pitch! They think it&#x27;s all over!&quot;
::(Geoff Hurst scores to put England two goals ahead)
:&quot;It is now, it&#x27;s four!&quot;

Soon after the 1966 victory, Wolstenholme&#x27;s quote became a widely used expression.

==In popular culture==

The phrase, along with other calls from English football matches, appears in New Order&#x27;s song &quot;World In Motion&quot;, although in that case Wolstenholme re-recorded it with the slightly different words &quot;Well, some of the crowd are on the pitch. They think it&#x27;s all over. Well it is now&quot;. The British band The Dentists called their first album &quot;Some People Are on the Pitch They Think It&#x27;s All Over It Is Now&quot; in Wolstenholme&#x27;s honour; the LP begins with a sample of Wolstenholme&#x27;s original commentary. Track #3 on British folk metal act Skyclad&#x27;s EP &quot;Jig-a-Jig&quot; is called &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;. The song contains the phrase &quot;They think it&#x27;s all over. Well is it now?&quot; in its chorus and includes several references to the 1966 FIFA World Cup.

In Neil Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; the last words that the character Cooper says are, &quot;You think it&#x27;s all over? It is now.&quot;

The quotation was also used as the title of the BBC&#x27;s satirical sports quiz show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, which appeared on BBC One from 1995 to 2006. The show has heightened the popularity of the phrase in recent years, though Kenneth Wolstenholme was reportedly unhappy with the use of the phrase for the title of the show.

An alternative mix for The Beatles song &quot;Glass Onion&quot;, which appeared on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;, contained a portion of Kenneth Wolstenholme&#x27;s commentary. At the end of the track he can be heard shouting &quot;It&#x27;s a goal!&quot; repeating for several seconds until the track fades.

In the Discworld book &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot; the book has two false endings, each followed by &quot;You think it&#x27;s all over?&quot; and at the actual end &quot;It is Now!&quot;

BBC parodist Dave Henson used the line to refer to the 1966 winning team during his parody of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; by Puff Daddy and the Family/The Police.
:&quot;Boys of &#x27;66 hey take a bow..&quot;
:&quot;They think it&#x27;s all over, it is now!&quot;

The video game &quot;Kinect Sports&quot;, which has football as one of the six sports represented, has two achievements that refer to the quote: &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over...&quot; is awarded when the players wins their first football match, and &quot;...It Is Now!&quot; is obtained when the player wins with a goal scored in the final 10 seconds.

<text>Victoria Mary, Lady Nicolson, CH (née Sackville-West; 9 March 1892 – 2 June 1962), usually known as Vita Sackville-West, was an English author and garden designer.

Sackville-West was a successful novelist, poet and journalist, as well as a prolific letter writer and diarist. She published more than a dozen collections of poetry and 13 novels during her life. She was twice awarded the Hawthornden Prize for Imaginative Literature: in 1927 for her pastoral epic, &quot;The Land&quot;, and in 1933 for her &quot;Collected Poems&quot;. She was the inspiration for the protagonist of &quot;&quot;, by her friend and lover Virginia Woolf.
She wrote a column in &quot;The Observer&quot; from 1946 to 1961 and is remembered for the celebrated garden at Sissinghurst in Kent, created with her husband, Sir Harold Nicolson.

==Biography==

===Antecedents===
Victoria Mary Sackville-West — called Vita, to distinguish her from her mother — was born on 9 March 1892 at Knole, the Kent home of Sackville-West&#x27;s aristocratic ancestors. She was the only child of cousins Victoria Sackville-West and Lionel Sackville-West, 3rd Baron Sackville. Vita&#x27;s mother, the illegitimate daughter of Lionel Sackville-West, 2nd Baron Sackville and the Spanish dancer Pepita (Josefa de Oliva, née Durán y Ortega), had been raised in a Parisian convent.

Although the marriage of Sackville-West&#x27;s parents was initially happy, the couple drifted apart shortly after her birth. Lionel took a mistress, an opera singer who came to live with them at Knole.

Knole had been given to Thomas Sackville by Elizabeth I, in the sixteenth century. The Sackville-West family followed the English aristocracy&#x27;s inheritance customs, preventing Vita from inheriting Knole upon the death of her father; this was a source of life-long bitterness for her. The house followed the title, and was bequeathed instead by her father to his brother Charles, who became the 4th Baron.

===Early life===
Sackville-West was initially taught at home by governesses and later attended Helen Wolff&#x27;s school for girls, an exclusive day school in Mayfair, where she met first loves Violet Keppel and Rosamund Grosvenor. She did not befriend local children and found it hard to make friends at school. Her biographers characterise her childhood as one filled by loneliness and isolation. She wrote prolifically at Knole, penning eight full-length (unpublished) novels between 1906 and 1910, ballads and many plays, some in French. Her lack of formal education led to later shyness with her peers, such as those in the Bloomsbury Group. She felt herself to be sluggish of mind and she was never at the intellectual heart of her social group.

Sackville-West&#x27;s apparently Roma lineage introduced a passion for &quot;gypsy&quot; ways, a culture she perceived to be hot-blooded, heart-led, dark, and romantic. It informed the stormy nature of many of her later love affairs and was a strong theme in her writing. Sackville-West visited Roma camps and felt herself to be at one with them.

Vita&#x27;s mother had a wide array of famous lovers, including financier J. P. Morgan and Sir John Murray Scott (from 1897 until his death in 1912). Scott, secretary to the couple who inherited and developed the Wallace Collection, was a devoted companion and Lady Sackville and he were rarely apart during their years together. During her childhood, Vita spent a great deal of time in Scott&#x27;s apartments in Paris, perfecting her already fluent French.

===First loves===
Sackville-West debuted in 1910. She was wooed by Orazio Pucci, son of a distinguished Florentine family; by Lord Granby (later 9th Duke of Rutland); and by Lord Lascelles (later 6th Earl of Harewood), among others. In 1924 she had a passionate affair with historian Geoffrey Scott. Scott&#x27;s marriage collapsed shortly thereafter, as was often the fallout with Sackville-West&#x27;s affairs, all with women after this point (as most of them had been beforehand).

Sackville-West fell in love with Rosamund Grosvenor (1888–1944), who was four years her senior. In her journal, Vita wrote &quot;Oh, I dare say I realized vaguely that I had no business to sleep with Rosamund, and I should certainly never have allowed anyone to find it out,&quot; but she saw no real conflict. Lady Sackville, Vita&#x27;s mother, invited Rosamund to visit the family at their villa in Monte Carlo (1910). Rosamund also stayed with Vita at Knole House, at Murray Scott&#x27;s pied-à-terre on the Rue Laffitte in Paris, and at Sluie, Scott&#x27;s shooting lodge in the Scottish Highlands, near Banchory. Their secret relationship ended in 1913 when Vita married.

Sackville-West was more deeply involved with Violet Keppel, daughter of the Hon. George Keppel and his wife, Alice Keppel. The sexual relationship began when they were both in their teens and strongly influenced them for years. Both later married and became writers.

=== Marriage to Harold Nicolson ===

Sackville-West was courted for 18 months by young diplomat Harold Nicolson, whom she found to be a secretive character. She writes that the wooing was entirely chaste and throughout they did not so much as kiss. In 1913, at age 21, Vita married him in the private chapel at Knole. Vita&#x27;s parents were opposed to the marriage on the grounds that &quot;penniless&quot; Nicolson had an annual income of only £250. He was the third secretary at the British Embassy in Constantinople at the time. Another of Sackville-West&#x27;s suitors, Lord Granby, had an annual income of £100,000, owned vast acres of land and was heir to an old title, Duke of Rutland.

The couple had an open marriage. Both Sackville-West and her husband had same-sex relationships before and during their marriage, as did some of the Bloomsbury Group of writers and artists, with whom they had connections. Sackville-West saw herself as psychologically divided into two: one side of her personality was more feminine, soft, submissive, and attracted to men while the other side was more masculine, hard, aggressive, and attracted to women.

Following the pattern of his father&#x27;s career, Harold Nicolson was at various times a diplomat, journalist, broadcaster, Member of Parliament, and author of biographies and novels. After the wedding the couple lived in Cihangir, a suburb of Constantinople (now Istanbul), the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Sackville-West loved Constantinople, but the duties of a diplomat&#x27;s wife did not appeal to her. It was only during this time that she attempted to don, with good grace, the part of a &quot;correct and adoring wife of the brilliant young diplomat&quot;, as she sarcastically wrote. When she became pregnant, in the summer of 1914, the couple returned to England to ensure that she could give birth in a British hospital.

The family lived at 182 Ebury Street, Belgravia and bought Long Barn in Kent as a country house (1915–1930). They employed the architect Edwin Lutyens to make improvements to the house. The British declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, following Ottoman naval attacks on Russia, precluded any return to Constantinople.

The couple had two children: Benedict (1914–1978), an art historian, and Nigel (1917–2004), a well-known editor, politician, and writer. Another son was stillborn in 1915.

===Relationship with Violet Keppel===
Sackville-West continued to receive devoted letters from her lover Violet Keppel. She was deeply upset to read of Keppel&#x27;s engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Her response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel and persuade her to honour their commitment. Keppel, depressed and suicidal, did eventually marry her fiancé, under pressure from her mother, though Keppel made it clear that she did not love her husband. Sackville-West called the marriage her own greatest failure.

Sackville-West and Keppel disappeared together several times from 1918 on, mostly to France. One day in 1918 Vita writes that she experienced a radical &#x27;liberation&#x27;, where her male aspect was unexpectedly freed. She writes: &quot;I went into wild spirits; I ran, I shouted, I jumped, I climbed, I vaulted over gates, I felt like a schoolboy let out on a holiday... that wild irresponsible day&quot;.

The mothers of both women joined forces to sabotage the relationship and force their daughters back to their husbands. But they were unsuccessful. Sackville-West often dressed as a man, styled as Keppel&#x27;s husband. The two women made a bond to remain faithful to one another, pledging that neither would engage in sexual relations with their husbands.

Keppel continued to pursue her lover to great lengths, until Sackville-West&#x27;s affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote that she felt very low, entertaining thoughts of suicide, believing that Nicolson would be better off without her. In 1920 the lovers ran off again to France together and their husbands chased after them in a small two-seater aeroplane. Sackville-West heard allegations that Keppel and her husband Trefusis had been involved sexually, and she broke off the relationship as the lesbian oath of fidelity had been broken. Despite the rift, the two women stayed devoted to one another.

===Persia===
From 1925 to 1927, Nicolson lived in Tehran where Sackville-West often visited him. Sackville-West&#x27;s book &quot;A Passenger to Tehran&quot; recounts her time there. The couple were involved in planning the coronation of Rezā Khan and got to know the six-year old Crown Prince Mohammad Reza well. She also visited and wrote about the former capital of Isfahan to see the Safavid palaces.

===Relationship with Virginia Woolf===
Sackville-West&#x27;s relationship with the prominent writer Virginia Woolf began in 1925 and ended in 1935, reaching its height between 1925 and 1928. The American scholar Louise DeSalvo wrote that the ten years while they were together were the artistic peak of both women&#x27;s careers, owing to the positive influence they had on one another: &quot;neither had ever written so much so well, and neither would ever again reach this peak of accomplishment&quot;.

In December 1922, Sackville-West first met Virginia Woolf at a dinner party in London. Though Sackville-West came from an aristocratic family that was far richer than Woolf&#x27;s own, the women bonded over their confined childhoods and emotionally absent parents. Woolf knew about Sackville-West&#x27;s relationship with Keppel and was impressed by her free spirit.

Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf&#x27;s writings, considering her to be the better author. She told Woolf in one letter: &quot;I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed&quot;. Though Woolf envied Sackville-West&#x27;s ability to write quickly, she was inclined to believe that the volumes were written too much in haste: &quot;Vita&#x27;s prose is too fluent&quot;.

As the two grew close, Woolf disclosed that as a child she had been abused by her step-brother. It was largely due to Sackville-West&#x27;s support that Woolf began to heal from the trauma, allowing her for the first time to have a satisfying erotic relationship. Woolf purchased a mirror during a trip to France with Sackville-West, saying she felt she could look in a mirror for the first time in her life. Sackville-West&#x27;s support gave Woolf greater confidence and helped her cast off her self-image of a sickly semi-recluse. She persuaded Woolf that her nervous ailments had been misdiagnosed, and that she should focus on her own varied intellectual projects; that she must learn to rest.

To help the Woolfs, Sackville-West chose their Hogarth Press to be her publisher. &quot;Seducers in Ecuador&quot;, the first Sackville-West novel to be published by Hogarth, sold only 1,500 copies in its first year. &quot;The Edwardians&quot;, published next, sold 30,000 copies in its first six months. The boost helped Hogarth financially, though Woolf did not always value the books&#x27; romantic themes. The increased security of the Press&#x27;s fortunes allowed Woolf to write more experimental novels such as &quot;The Waves&quot;. Though contemporary critics consider Woolf a better writer, critics in the 1920s viewed Sackville-West as more accomplished, with her books outselling Woolf&#x27;s by a large margin.

Sackville-West loved to travel, frequently going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia. These trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, noteworthy for its theme of longing for someone absent, was partly inspired by Sackville-West&#x27;s frequent absences. Sackville-West inspired Woolf to write one of her most famous novels, &quot;&quot;, featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West&#x27;s son Nigel Nicolson as &quot;the longest and most charming love-letter in literature.&quot;

There were, however, tensions in the relationship. Woolf was often bothered by what she viewed as Sackville-West&#x27;s promiscuity, charging that Sackville-West&#x27;s great need for sex led her to take up with anyone who struck her fancy. In &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1929), Woolf attacks patriarchal inheritance laws. This was an implicit criticism of Sackville-West, who never questioned the leading social and political position of the aristocracy to which she belonged. She felt that Sackville-West was unable to critique the system she was both a part of and, to a certain extent, a victim of. In the 1930s they clashed over Nicolson&#x27;s &quot;unfortunate&quot; involvement with Oswald Mosley and the New Party (later renamed the British Union of Fascists), and they were at odds over the imminent war. Sackville-West supported rearmament while Woolf remained loyal to her pacifism; this contributed to the distancing of their relationship in 1935.

However, the two women reconnected in 1937 and remained close until Woolf&#x27;s death in 1941.

===Other lovers===
One of Sackville-West&#x27;s male suitors, Henry Lascelles, would later marry the Princess Royal and become the 6th Earl of Harewood.

In 1927, Sackville-West had an affair with Mary Garman, a member of the Bloomsbury Group; between 1929 and 1931, she maintained a relationship with Hilda Matheson, head of the BBC Talks Department. In 1931, Sackville-West was in a ménage à trois with journalist Evelyn Irons and Irons&#x27;s lover, Olive Rinder. Irons had interviewed Sackville-West after her novel &quot;The Edwardians&quot; had become a best-seller.

==Sissinghurst==

In 1930 the family acquired and moved to Sissinghurst Castle, near Cranbrook, Kent. It had once been owned by Vita&#x27;s ancestors. This gave it a dynastic attraction as she was excluded from inheriting Knole and a title. Sissinghurst was an Elizabethan ruin and the creation of the gardens would be a joint labour of love that would last many decades, first entailing years of clearing debris from the land. Nicolson provided the architectural structure, with strong classical lines, which would frame his wife&#x27;s innovative informal planting schemes. She created a new and experimental system of enclosures or rooms, such as the White Garden, Rose Garden, Orchard, Cottage Garden and Nuttery. She also innovated single colour-themed gardens and design principles orientating the visitors&#x27; experience to discovery and exploration. Her first garden at Long Barn (Kent, 1915–1930) was experimental, a place of learning by trial and error and she carried over her ideas and projects to Sissinghurst, using her hard won experience. Sissinghurst was first opened to the public in 1938.

Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break as she needed money to pay for Sissinghurst. Nicolson, having left the Foreign Office, no longer had a diplomat&#x27;s salary to draw upon. She also had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton College. She felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf. In 1947 she began a weekly column in &quot;The Observer&quot; called &quot;In your Garden&quot;, although she was not a trained horticulturist or designer. She continued the very popular column until a year before her death, and writing helped to make Sissinghurst one of the most famous and visited gardens in England. In 1948 she became a founder member of the National Trust&#x27;s garden committee. The grounds are now run by the National Trust. She was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal from the Royal Horticultural Society.

==Writing==
===&quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot;===
In the early 1920s Sackville-West wrote a memoir of her relationships. In it she sought to explain both why she had chosen to stay with Nicolson and why she had fallen in love with Violet Keppel. The work, titled &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot;, was not published until 1973. In the book she uses metaphors from nature to present her account as truthful and honest, describing her life as a &quot;bog&quot; and a &quot;swamp&quot;, suggesting that her personal life was naturally unappealing and unpleasant. Sackville-West stated that she wanted to explain her sexuality, which she presented as being at the core of her personality. She wrote that in the future &quot;it will be recognized that many more people of my type do exist than under the present-day system of hypocrisy is commonly admitted&quot;.

Reflecting a certain ambivalence about her sexuality, Sackville-West presented her sexual desires for Keppel as both &quot;deviant&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;, as if she herself was uncertain of whether her sexuality was normal or not, though the American scholar Georgia Johnston has argued that Sackville-West&#x27;s confusion on this point was due to her wish to have this memoir published one day. In this regard, Sackville-West wrote of her deep desire and love for Keppel while at same time declaring her &quot;shame&quot; about this &quot;duality with which I was too weak and too self-indulgent to struggle&quot;. At various times, Sackville-West called herself a &quot;pariah&quot; with a &quot;perverted nature&quot; and &quot;unnatural&quot; feelings for Keppel, who was portrayed as a tempting, if degrading, object of her desire. Sackville-West called for a &quot;spirit of candor&quot; in society that would allow for tolerance of gay and bisexual people. Much influenced by the theories promoted by sexologists like Magnus Hirschfeld, Edward Carpenter, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud, Sackville-West sometimes wrote of her sexuality as abnormal and wrong and due to some psychological flaw she was born with, portraying heterosexuality as the norm that she wanted, but failed to live up to.

Several times, Sackville-West stated that she wrote &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot; for scientific purposes so people would be able to understand bisexual people, which would thus allow her, despite her self-condemnation, to present her sexuality as in some way normal. Several of the sexologists Sackville-West cited, most notably Carpenter and Ellis, had argued that homosexuality and bisexuality were in fact normal, and despite her condemning herself, her use of a &quot;scientific&quot; approach backed up with quotes from Ellis and Carpenter allowed her to present her bisexuality as implicitly normal. Writing in the third person, Sackville-West declared &quot;she regrets that the person Harold married wasn&#x27;t entirely and wholly what he had thought of her, and that the person who loves and owns Violet isn&#x27;t a second person, because each suits each other&quot;. Sackville-West presented her sexuality as part of the personality she had been born with, portraying herself as an accursed woman who should be the object of sympathy, not condemnation.

In 1973, when her son Nigel Nicolson published &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot;, he was uncertain if he was going to be charged with obscenity, going to considerable lengths to stress the legitimacy of a love for a person of the same sex in his introduction. Despite portraying herself as in some way &quot;deviant&quot; because of her feelings for women, Sackville-West also wrote in &quot;Portrait of a Marriage&quot; of the discovery and acceptance of her bisexuality as a teenager as the joyous &quot;liberation of half my personality&quot;, suggesting that she did not really see herself as a woman with &quot;deviant&quot; sexuality, as this statement contradicted what she had written at the beginning of the book about her &quot;perverted&quot; sexuality. Johnson wrote that Sackville-West, in presenting the lesbian side of herself in terms that depicted Keppel as evil and Nicolson as good, was the only way possible at the time to express this side of her personality, writing &quot;even if annihilating herself seemed the only way she could present any type of acceptable self.&quot;

The memoir was dramatised by the BBC (and PBS in North America) in 1990, starring Janet McTeer as Vita, and Cathryn Harrison as Violet. The series won four BAFTAs.

===&quot;Challenge&quot;===
Sackville-West&#x27;s novel &quot;Challenge&quot; (1923) also bears witness to her affair with Keppel: Sackville-West and Keppel had started writing this book as a collaborative endeavour. It was published in America but banned in the UK until 1974.

The male character&#x27;s name, Julian, had been Sackville-West&#x27;s nickname when passing as a man. &quot;Challenge&quot; (first entitled &quot;Rebellion&quot;, then &quot;Enchantment&quot;, then &quot;Vanity&quot; and at some point &quot;Foam&quot;), is a &quot;roman à clef&quot; with the character of Julian being a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Keppel. Notably, Sackville-West in &quot;Challenge&quot; defends Keppel against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Keppel a &quot;swine&quot; and a &quot;pig&quot;, and in the book Julian goes out of his way to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig. In the book, Julian says that &quot;Eve is not a &#x27;little swine&#x27;, she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine&quot;.

Reflecting her obsession with the Romani people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romani woman with an &quot;insinuating femininity&quot; that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence. Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: &quot;Don&#x27;t &quot;please&quot; dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did&quot;. When &quot;Challenge&quot; was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romani reading: &quot;This book is yours, honoured witch. If you read it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free&quot;. Throughout their relationship, Keppel was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally drowns herself by walking in the sea when Julian is aboard a boat and too far off to hear her calling for him. The book&#x27;s ending reflected Sackville-West&#x27;s guilt about breaking her relationship with Keppel.

Her mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita&#x27;s son Nigel Nicolson praises his mother: &quot;She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything ... How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?&quot;

Sackville-West was fascinated with and often wrote about the Roma people. As the British scholar Kirstie Blair noted, for her: &quot;Gypsies represent liberation, excitement, danger and the free expression of sexuality&quot;. In particular, the Roma women, especially Spanish Romani women, served as a symbol for female homosexuality in her writings. As with many other female writers in this period, for Sackville-West, the Romani represented a social element both familiar and strange; a people perceived and admired as flamboyant romantics while at the same time viewed and hated as shifty, dishonest types; a rootless people who belonged nowhere yet could be found everywhere in Europe, serving as a symbol for a sort of unconventional femininity. The picture Sackville-West held of the Romani was much influenced by orientalism, as the Romani were believed to have originated from India. The idea of a people who belonged nowhere, existing outside of the values of &quot;civilization&quot;, held genuine appeal to her as it offered up the possibility of gender roles different from those held in the West. Sackville-West was English, but she invented Romani ancestry for herself on the Spanish side of her family, explaining her bohemian behaviour as due to her alleged &quot;Gypsy&quot; descent.

===&quot;Orlando&quot;===
Woolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write her novel &quot;&quot; (1928), featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. Reflecting Sackville-West&#x27;s interest in the Romani, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romani witch whom he married), it is at a Romani camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romani in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West&#x27;s Romani fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romani caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romani, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. &quot;Orlando&quot;, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate, not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man), ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world.

===&quot;Family History&quot;===
Sackville-West&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Family History&quot; tells the story of Evelyn Jarrold, a rich widow who married into a family which owes its recent wealth and social position to the ownership of coal mines, and her ill-fated love affair with Miles Vane-Merrick, a much younger man with progressive social ideas. Evelyn Jarrold&#x27;s husband, Tommy, died in the Great War, and she has nothing to occupy her apart from her son Dan (the Jarrolds&#x27; heir, who is away at Eton), social events, and visits to her dressmaker. Vane-Merrick is a farming landowner and Member of Parliament, and is writing a book on economics. He represents new, progressive values and the male world of work and economic activity, and Evelyn Jarrold represents traditional values and the female world of family ties and social engagements.

The characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in &quot;Family History&quot; are socialists, pacifists and feminists, thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. In &quot;Orlando&quot;, Woolf allowed Vita to finally &quot;own&quot; Knole, and in &quot;Family History&quot;, Vita returns the gesture, as the Anquetils have children who turned out to be intelligent and decent people. Woolf had never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother. In casting her fictional alter-ego as an excellent mother she was offering a &quot;gift&quot; to Woolf.

===Other work and achievements===
Most of the novels were an immediate success (except &quot;Dark Island&quot;, &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; and &quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot;). &quot;All Passion Spent&quot; (1931) and &quot;Seducers in Ecuador&quot; (1924) sold especially well. Somewhat ironically &quot;Seducers&quot; overtook her mentor&#x27;s novel &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; at the top of the sales charts.

&quot;The Edwardians&quot; (1930) and &quot;All Passion Spent&quot; are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long-suppressed sense of freedom and whimsy after a life-time of following convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. &quot;All Passion Spent&quot; appears to reflect Woolf&#x27;s influence. The character of Lady Slane begins to truly live only after the death of her husband, a former prime minister. She befriends the servants of her estate, discovering the lives of people she had previously ignored. At the end of the novel Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage in order to pursue her career as a musician.

&quot;Grand Canyon&quot; (1942) is a science fiction &quot;cautionary tale&quot; (as she termed it) about a Nazi invasion of an unprepared United States. The book takes an unsuspected twist, however, that makes it something more than a typical invasion yarn.

A recently rediscovered work from 1922 &quot;A Note of Explanation&quot; was written specifically to be a part of the miniature collection of books within the doll&#x27;s House, and tells the story of a sprite that inhabits the doll&#x27;s house and re-tells several fairy tales from the point of view of the sprite, indicating how they had influenced the story.
The book was adapted for the stage by Emily Ingram under the title &quot;A Sprite in the Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in 2019 and was performed in Edinburgh, at the Palace of Holyrood House as part of their Christmas festivities.

The poetry remains the least known of Sackville-West&#x27;s work. It encompassed epics and translations of volumes such as Rilke&#x27;s &quot;Duino Elegies&quot;. Her epic poems &quot;The Land&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Garden&quot; (1946) reflect an enduring passion for the earth and family tradition.&quot;The Land&quot; may have been written in response to the central work of Modernist poetry &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (also published by Hogarth Press). She dedicated her poem to her lover Dorothy Wellesley. A recording of Sackville-West reading it was released by the British Columbia label. Her poem won the Hawthornden Prize in 1927. She won it again in 1933 with her &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, becoming the only writer to do so twice. &quot;The Garden&quot; won the Heinemann Award for literature.

Her epic poem &quot;Solitude&quot;, published by the Hogarth Press in October 1938 contains references to the Bible, Paracelsus, Ixion, Catullus, Andromeda, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and a Sabine bride, all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938. The narrator of &quot;Solitude&quot; has an ardent love of the English countryside. Though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer present and who is deeply missed. At one point, the narrator&#x27;s horror and disgust at Ixion, a brutal rapist, implies that she is a woman. At another point in the poem, her desire to free Andromeda from her chains and to make love suggests that she is a lesbian. The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books, as both cultivate her mind. She thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature.

She is not well known as a biographer. The most famous of those works is her biography of Saint Joan of Arc in the work of the same name. Additionally, she composed a dual biography of Saint Teresa of Ávila and Thérèse of Lisieux entitled &quot;The Eagle and the Dove,&quot; a biography of the author Aphra Behn, and a biography of her maternal grandmother, the Spanish dancer known as &quot;Pepita&quot;.

Despite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often forced herself to participate in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to feel a sense of belonging. Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favour with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin. In 1947 Sackville-West was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

==Death and legacy==
Vita Sackville-West died at Sissinghurst in June 1962, aged 70, from abdominal cancer. She was cremated and ashes buried in the family crypt within the church at Withyham, eastern Sussex.

Sissinghurst Castle is owned by the National Trust. Her son Nigel Nicolson lived there after her death, and following his death in 2004 his own son Adam Nicolson, Baron Carnock, came to live there with his family. With his wife, the horticulturalist Sarah Raven, they committed to restore the mixed working farm and growing food on the property for residents and visitors, a function that had withered under the aegis of the Trust.

The film &quot;Vita and Virginia&quot;, with Gemma Arterton as Vita and Elizabeth Debicki as Virginia, had its world premiere at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. It is directed by Chanya Button and based on a play by Eileen Atkins, created from the love letters between Sackville-West and Woolf. The play was first performed in London in October 1993 and off Broadway in November 1994.

<text>In number theory, the study of Diophantine approximation deals with the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers. It is named after Diophantus of Alexandria.

The first problem was to know how well a real number can be approximated by rational numbers. For this problem, a rational number &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; is a &quot;good&quot; approximation of a real number &quot;α&quot; if the absolute value of the difference between &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; and &quot;α&quot; may not decrease if &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; is replaced by another rational number with a smaller denominator. This problem was solved during the 18th century by means of simple continued fractions.

Knowing the &quot;best&quot; approximations of a given number, the main problem of the field is to find sharp upper and lower bounds of the above difference, expressed as a function of the denominator. It appears that these bounds depend on the nature of the real numbers to be approximated: the lower bound for the approximation of a rational number by another rational number is larger than the lower bound for algebraic numbers, which is itself larger than the lower bound for all real numbers. Thus a real number that may be better approximated than the bound for algebraic numbers is certainly a transcendental number. 

This knowledge enabled Liouville, in 1844, to produce the first explicit transcendental number. Later, the proofs that  and &quot;e&quot; are transcendental were obtained by a similar method. 

Diophantine approximations and transcendental number theory are very close areas that share many theorems and methods. Diophantine approximations also have important applications in the study of Diophantine equations.

The 2022 Fields Medal was awarded to James Maynard, in part for his work on Diophantine approximation.

== Best Diophantine approximations of a real number ==
Given a real number , there are two ways to define a best Diophantine approximation of . For the first definition, the rational number is a &quot;best Diophantine approximation&quot; of if
:formula_1
for every rational number different from such that .

For the second definition, the above inequality is replaced by
:formula_2

A best approximation for the second definition is also a best approximation for the first one, but the converse is not true in general.

The theory of continued fractions allows us to compute the best approximations of a real number: for the second definition, they are the convergents of its expression as a regular continued fraction. For the first definition, one has to consider also the semiconvergents.

For example, the constant &quot;e&quot; = 2.718281828459045235... has the (regular) continued fraction representation

:formula_3

Its best approximations for the second definition are
:formula_4
while, for the first definition, they are
:formula_5

==Measure of the accuracy of approximations ==

The obvious measure of the accuracy of a Diophantine approximation of a real number by a rational number is formula_6 However, this quantity can always be made arbitrarily small by increasing the absolute values of and ; thus the accuracy of the approximation is usually estimated by comparing this quantity to some function of the denominator , typically a negative power of it.

For such a comparison, one may want upper bounds or lower bounds of the accuracy. A lower bound is typically described by a theorem like &quot;for every element of some subset of the real numbers and every rational number , we have formula_7 &quot;. In some cases, &quot;every rational number&quot; may be replaced by &quot;all rational numbers except a finite number of them&quot;, which amounts to multiplying by some constant depending on .

For upper bounds, one has to take into account that not all the &quot;best&quot; Diophantine approximations provided by the convergents may have the desired accuracy. Therefore, the theorems take the form &quot;for every element of some subset of the real numbers, there are infinitely many rational numbers such that formula_8 &quot;.

===Badly approximable numbers===
A badly approximable number is an &quot;x&quot; for which there is a positive constant &quot;c&quot; such that for all rational &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; we have

:formula_9

The badly approximable numbers are precisely those with bounded partial quotients.

Equivalently, a number is badly approximable if and only if its Markov constant is finite and its simple continued fraction is bounded.

== Lower bounds for Diophantine approximations ==

=== Approximation of a rational by other rationals ===
A rational number formula_10 may be obviously and perfectly approximated by formula_11 for every positive integer &quot;i&quot;.

If formula_12 we have
:formula_13
because formula_14 is a positive integer and is thus not lower than 1. Thus the accuracy of the approximation is bad relative to irrational numbers (see next sections).

It may be remarked that the preceding proof uses a variant of the pigeonhole principle: a non-negative integer that is not 0 is not smaller than 1. This apparently trivial remark is used in almost every proof of lower bounds for Diophantine approximations, even the most sophisticated ones.

In summary, a rational number is perfectly approximated by itself, but is badly approximated by any other rational number.

=== Approximation of algebraic numbers, Liouville&#x27;s result ===
In the 1840s, Joseph Liouville obtained the first lower bound for the approximation of algebraic numbers: If &quot;x&quot; is an irrational algebraic number of degree &quot;n&quot; over the rational numbers, then there exists a constant such that

:formula_15

holds for all integers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; where .

This result allowed him to produce the first proven example of a transcendental number, the Liouville constant
:formula_16
which does not satisfy Liouville&#x27;s theorem, whichever degree &quot;n&quot; is chosen.

This link between Diophantine approximations and transcendental number theory continues to the present day. Many of the proof techniques are shared between the two areas.

=== Approximation of algebraic numbers, Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem ===
Over more than a century, there were many efforts to improve Liouville&#x27;s theorem: every improvement of the bound enables us to prove that more numbers are transcendental. The main improvements are due to , , , and , leading finally to the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem: If is an irrational algebraic number and , then there exists a positive real number such that
:formula_17
holds for every integer and such that .

In some sense, this result is optimal, as the theorem would be false with &quot;ε&quot; = 0. This is an immediate consequence of the upper bounds described below.

=== Simultaneous approximations of algebraic numbers ===

Subsequently, Wolfgang M. Schmidt generalized this to the case of simultaneous approximations, proving that: If are algebraic numbers such that are linearly independent over the rational numbers and is any given positive real number, then there are only finitely many rational -tuples such that
:formula_18

Again, this result is optimal in the sense that one may not remove from the exponent.

=== Effective bounds ===
All preceding lower bounds are not effective, in the sense that the proofs do not provide any way to compute the constant implied in the statements. This means that one cannot use the results or their proofs to obtain bounds on the size of solutions of related Diophantine equations. However, these techniques and results can often be used to bound the number of solutions of such equations.

Nevertheless, a refinement of Baker&#x27;s theorem by Feldman provides an effective bound: if &quot;x&quot; is an algebraic number of degree &quot;n&quot; over the rational numbers, then there exist effectively computable constants &quot;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &lt; &quot;n&quot; such that

:formula_19

Aleksandr Khinchin proved in 1926 that if the series formula_20 diverges, then almost every real number (in the sense of Lebesgue measure) is formula_21-approximable, and if the series converges, then almost every real number is not formula_21-approximable. The circle of ideas surrounding this theorem and its relatives is known as &quot;metric Diophantine approximation&quot; or the &quot;metric theory of Diophantine approximation&quot; (not to be confused with height &quot;metrics&quot; in Diophantine geometry) or &quot;metric number theory&quot;.

 proved a generalization of Khinchin&#x27;s result, and posed what is now known as the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture on the analogue of Khinchin&#x27;s dichotomy for general, not necessarily decreasing, sequences formula_21 . proved that a Hausdorff measure analogue of the Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture is equivalent to the original Duffin–Schaeffer conjecture, which is a priori weaker.
In July 2019, Dimitris Koukoulopoulos and James Maynard announced a proof of the conjecture.

=== Hausdorff dimension of exceptional sets ===

An important example of a function formula_21 to which Khinchin&#x27;s theorem can be applied is the function formula_25, where &quot;c&quot; &gt; 1 is a real number. For this function, the relevant series converges and so Khinchin&#x27;s theorem tells us that almost every point is not formula_26-approximable. Thus, the set of numbers which are formula_26-approximable forms a subset of the real line of Lebesgue measure zero. The Jarník-Besicovitch theorem, due to V. Jarník and A. S. Besicovitch, states that the Hausdorff dimension of this set is equal to formula_28. In particular, the set of numbers which are formula_26-approximable for some formula_30 (known as the set of &quot;very well approximable numbers&quot;) has Hausdorff dimension one, while the set of numbers which are formula_26-approximable for all formula_30 (known as the set of Liouville numbers) has Hausdorff dimension zero.

Another important example is the function formula_33, where formula_34 is a real number. For this function, the relevant series diverges and so Khinchin&#x27;s theorem tells us that almost every number is formula_35-approximable. This is the same as saying that every such number is &quot;well approximable&quot;, where a number is called well approximable if it is not badly approximable. So an appropriate analogue of the Jarník-Besicovitch theorem should concern the Hausdorff dimension of the set of badly approximable numbers. And indeed, V. Jarník proved that the Hausdorff dimension of this set is equal to one. This result was improved by W. M. Schmidt, who showed that the set of badly approximable numbers is &quot;incompressible&quot;, meaning that if formula_36 is a sequence of bi-Lipschitz maps, then the set of numbers &quot;x&quot; for which formula_37 are all badly approximable has Hausdorff dimension one. Schmidt also generalized Jarník&#x27;s theorem to higher dimensions, a significant achievement because Jarník&#x27;s argument is essentially one-dimensional, depending on the apparatus of continued fractions.

== Uniform distribution ==

Another topic that has seen a thorough development is the theory of uniform distribution mod 1. Take a sequence &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ... of real numbers and consider their &quot;fractional parts&quot;. That is, more abstractly, look at the sequence in formula_38, which is a circle. For any interval &quot;I&quot; on the circle we look at the proportion of the sequence&#x27;s elements that lie in it, up to some integer &quot;N&quot;, and compare it to the proportion of the circumference occupied by &quot;I&quot;. &quot;Uniform distribution&quot; means that in the limit, as &quot;N&quot; grows, the proportion of hits on the interval tends to the &#x27;expected&#x27; value. Hermann Weyl proved a basic result showing that this was equivalent to bounds for exponential sums formed from the sequence. This showed that Diophantine approximation results were closely related to the general problem of cancellation in exponential sums, which occurs throughout analytic number theory in the bounding of error terms.

Related to uniform distribution is the topic of irregularities of distribution, which is of a combinatorial nature.

== Algorithms ==
Grotschel, Lovasz and Schrijver describe algorithms for finding approximately-best diophantine approximations, both for individual real numbers and for set of real numbers. The latter problem is called simultaneous diophantine approximation.

== Unsolved problems ==

There are still simply stated unsolved problems remaining in Diophantine approximation, for example the &quot;Littlewood conjecture&quot; and the &quot;lonely runner conjecture&quot;.
It is also unknown if there are algebraic numbers with unbounded coefficients in their continued fraction expansion.

== Recent developments ==

In his plenary address at the International Mathematical Congress in Kyoto (1990), Grigory Margulis outlined a broad program rooted in ergodic theory that allows one to prove number-theoretic results using the dynamical and ergodic properties of actions of subgroups of semisimple Lie groups. The work of D. Kleinbock, G. Margulis and their collaborators demonstrated the power of this novel approach to classical problems in Diophantine approximation. Among its notable successes are the proof of the decades-old Oppenheim conjecture by Margulis, with later extensions by Dani and Margulis and Eskin–Margulis–Mozes, and the proof of Baker and Sprindzhuk conjectures in the Diophantine approximations on manifolds by Kleinbock and Margulis. Various generalizations of the above results of Aleksandr Khinchin in metric Diophantine approximation have also been obtained within this framework.

<text>Flagellants are practitioners of a form of mortification of the flesh by whipping their skin with various instruments of penance. Many Christian confraternities of penitents have flagellants, who beat themselves, both in the privacy of their dwellings and in public processions, to repent of sins and share in the Passion of Jesus.

In the 14th century, a movement within Western Christianity known as Flagellantism became popular and adherents &quot;began beating their flesh in a public penitential ritual in response to war, famine, plague and fear engendered by millenarianism.&quot; Though this movement withered away, the practices of public repentance and promoting peace were adopted by the flagellants in Christian, especially Roman Catholic, confraternities of penitents that exist to the present-day.

== History ==

Flagellation (from Latin &quot;flagellare&quot;, to whip) was quite a common practice amongst the more fervently religious throughout antiquity. The practice became popular in 1260 thanks to the example of Blessed Raniero Fasani of Perugia, a saintly hermit who began scourging himself publicly after receiving an apparition of the Virgin Mary and St. Bevignate who told him to start preaching penance for sins and to establish peace. He attracted followers and the movement grew in popularity throughout Italy and the rest of Europe.

Christianity has formed a permanent tradition surrounding the doctrine of mortification of the flesh, ranging from self-denial, wearing hairshirts and chains, to fasting and self-flagellation using the discipline. Those who practice self-flagellation claim that St. Paul&#x27;s statement in the Bible ‘I chastise my body’ refers to self-inflicted bodily scourging (). There are prominent Christians who have practiced self-flagellation. Martin Luther, the Protestant Reformer, self-flagellated among other ascetic practices during his early years as an Augustinian friar (although he later condemned such practices). Likewise, the Congregationalist writer Sarah Osborn also practiced self-flagellation in order &quot;to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God&quot;. It became &quot;quite common&quot; for members of the Tractarian movement within the Anglican Communion to practice self-flagellation using a discipline.

Historically speaking, in the 11th century, Peter Damian, a Benedictine monk in the Roman Catholic tradition, taught that spirituality should manifest itself in physical discipline; he admonished those who sought to follow Christ to practice self-flagellation for the duration of the time it takes one to recite forty Psalms, increasing the number of flagellations on holy days of the liturgical calendar. For Damian, only those who shared in the sufferings of Christ could be saved. Throughout Christian history, the mortification of the flesh, wherein one denies physical pleasures, has been commonly followed by members of the clergy, especially in Christian monasteries and convents; the 11th-century Dominicus Loricatus repeated the entire Psalter twenty times in one week, accompanying each psalm with a hundred lash-strokes to his back. The distinction of the Flagellants was to take this self-mortification into the cities and other public spaces as a demonstration of piety.

== Flagellantism ==

Flagellantism was a 14th-century movement, consisting of penitents in the Catholic Church. It began as a Christian pilgrimage and was later condemned by the Catholic Church as heretical. The followers were noted for including public flagellation in their rituals. This was a common practice during the Black Death, or the Great Plague.
===Spread in the 14th century===
The first recorded incident was in Central Italy in Perugia, in 1259, the year after severe crop damage and famine throughout Europe. From Perugia the phenomenon seemed to spread across Northern Italy and into Austria. Other incidents are recorded in 1296, 1333-34 (the Doves), notably at the time of the Black Death (1349), and 1399. The practice peaked during the Black Death. Spontaneously Flagellant groups arose across Northern and Central Europe in 1349, including in England.

Initially the Catholic Church tolerated the Flagellants and individual monks, friars and priests joined in the early movements. By the 14th century, the Church was less tolerant and the rapid spread of the movement was alarming. Clement VI officially condemned them in a bull of October 20, 1349 and instructed Church leaders to suppress the Flagellants. This position was reinforced in 1372 by Gregory XI who associated the Flagellants with other heretical groups, notably the Beghards, and instructed inquisitors to eradicate them. They were accused of heresies including doubting the need for the sacraments, denying ordinary ecclesiastical jurisdiction and claiming to work miracles. In 1392, a sect of Flagellants and Beghards, consisting of peasants, were found throughout Swabia and Wurzburg. The papal inquisitor imposed the penance of preaching and joining a crusade against the Ottoman Turks.

The Inquisition was active against any revival of the movement in the 15th century, but action against the flagellants was often taken by the local princes. In 1414, 80–90 followers of Konrad Schmid were burned in Thuringia, in Germany, even though they had recanted. Three hundred were burnt in one day in 1416, also in Thuringia. Other trials where the accused were condemned as Flagellants were recorded as late as the 1480s. The practice of flagellation within the bounds of the Catholic Church continued as an accepted form of penance.

Rulers like Catherine de&#x27; Medici and France&#x27;s King Henry III supported Flagellants but Henry IV banned them. Flagellant orders like &quot;Hermanos Penitentes&quot; (Spanish &#x27;Penitential Brothers&#x27;) also appeared in colonial Spanish America, even against the specific orders of Church authorities.

====In Italy====

The first recorded cases of mass popular flagellation occurred in Perugia, in 1259. The prime cause of the Perugia episode is unclear, but it followed an outbreak of an epidemic and chroniclers report how mania spread throughout almost all the people of the city. Thousands of citizens gathered in great processions, singing and with crosses and banners, they marched throughout the city whipping themselves. It is reported that surprising acts of charity and repentance accompanied the marchers. However, one chronicler noted that anyone who did not join in the flagellation was accused of being in league with the devil. They also killed Jews and priests who opposed them. Marvin Harris links them to the Messianic preaching of Gioacchino da Fiore. 

Similar processions occurred across Northern Italy, with groups of up to 10,000 strong processing in Modena, Bologna, Reggio and Parma. Although certain city authorities refused the Flagellant processions entry. 

A similar movement arose again in 1399, again in Northern Italy in the form of the White Penitents or &quot;Bianchi&quot; movement. This rising is said to have been started by a peasant who saw a vision. The movement became known as the &quot;laudesi&quot; from their constant hymn singing. At its peak, a group of over 15,000 adherents gathered in Modena and marched to Rome, but the movement rapidly faded when one of its leaders was burned at the stake by order of Boniface IX.

====In Germany and the Low Countries ====

The German and Low Countries movement, the Brothers of the Cross, is particularly well documented - they wore white robes and marched across Germany in 33.5 day campaigns (each day referred to a year of Jesus&#x27;s earthly life) of penance, only stopping in any one place for no more than a day. They established their camps in fields near towns and held their rituals twice a day. The ritual began with the reading of a letter, claimed to have been delivered by an angel and justifying the Flagellants&#x27; activities. Next, the followers would fall to their knees and scourge themselves, gesturing with their free hands to indicate their sin and striking themselves rhythmically to songs, known as &quot;Geisslerlieder&quot;, until blood flowed. Sometimes the blood was soaked up in rags and treated as a holy relic. Originally members were required to receive permission to join from their spouses and to prove that they could pay for their food. However, some towns began to notice that sometimes Flagellants brought plague to towns where it had not yet surfaced. Therefore, later they were denied entry. They responded with increased physical penance.

== Modern flagellants ==
=== Christianity ===

==== Roman Catholicism ====
Modern processions of hooded Flagellants are still a feature of various Mediterranean Christian countries, mainly in Italy, Spain and some of its former colonies such as the Philippines, usually every year during Lent and intensify during Holy Week. For example, in the &quot;comune&quot; of Guardia Sanframondi in Campania, such parades are organized once every seven years. In Italy, members of the Flagellant movement were called &quot;disciplinati&quot;, while &quot;laudesi&quot; never practiced flagellation, but met together in their own chapel to sing &quot;laudi&quot; (canticles) in honour of the Blessed Virgin, but which gradually assumed a dramatic form and grew into a theatrical form known as &quot;rappresentazioni sacre&quot;. A play in the Roman dialect of the 14th century, edited by Vattasso (Studi e Testi, no. 4, p. 53), explicitly bears the title lauda.

In the Philippines, some practice penitential flagellation and have themselves briefly crucified, at times in fulfilment of a &quot;panatà&quot; (sacred vow) made to God. Both customs are deemed as heterodox acts of penance by the Church in the Philippines, whose episcopate have condemned repeatedly.
&quot;Los hermanos penitentes&quot; (English: “The penitent brothers”) is a semi-secret society of flagellants among Hispanic Roman Catholics in the American states of Colorado and New Mexico.

=== Other religions ===
Unrelated practices exist in non-Christian traditions, including actual flagellation amongst some Shiites who were converted by the Qizilbash (commemorating the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali).

<text>The Italian Communist Party (, PCI) was a communist and democratic socialist political party in Italy. It was established in Livorno as the Communist Party of Italy (, PCd&#x27;I) on 21 January 1921, when it seceded from the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), under the leadership of Amadeo Bordiga, Antonio Gramsci, and Nicola Bombacci. Outlawed during the Italian fascist regime, the party continued to operate underground and played a major role in the Italian resistance movement. The party&#x27;s peaceful and national road to socialism, or the Italian road to socialism, the realisation of the communist project through democracy, repudiating the use of violence and applying the Constitution of Italy in all its parts, a strategy inaugurated under Palmiro Togliatti but that some date back to Gramsci, would become the leitmotif of the party&#x27;s history.

Having changed its name in 1943, the PCI became the second largest political party of Italy after World War II, attracting the support of about a third of the vote share during the 1970s. At the time, it was the largest Communist party in the Western world, with peak support reaching 2.3 million members in 1947, and peak share being 34.4% of the vote (12.6 million votes) in the 1976 Italian general election. The PCI was part of the Constituent Assembly of Italy and the Italian government from 1944 to 1947, when the United States ordered a removal from government of the PCI and PSI. The PCI–PSI alliance lasted until 1956; the two parties continued to govern at the local and regional level until the 1990s. Apart from the 1944–1947 years and occasional external support to the organic centre-left (1960s–1970s), which included the PSI, the PCI always remained at the opposition in the Italian Parliament, with more accommodation as part of the Historic Compromise of the 1970s, which ended in 1980, until its dissolution in 1991, not without controversy and much debate among its members.

The PCI included Marxist–Leninists and Marxist revisionists, with a notable social-democratic faction being the &quot;miglioristi&quot;. Under the leadership of Enrico Berlinguer and the influence of the &quot;miglioristi&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s, Marxism–Leninism was removed from the party statute and the PCI adhered to the Eurocommunist trend, seeking independence from the Soviet Union and moving into a democratic socialist direction. In 1991, it was dissolved and re-launched as the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), which joined the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists. The more radical members of the organisation formally seceded to establish the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC).

==History==

===Early years===

The roots of the PCI date back to 1921, when the I Congress of the Communist Party of Italy was held in Livorno on 21 January, following a split in the XVII Congress of the Italian Socialist Party. The split occurred after the Congress of Livorno refused to expel the reformist group as required by the Communist International (Comintern). The main factions of the new party were L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo, based in Turin and led by Antonio Gramsci, and the Maximalist faction led by Nicola Bombacci. Amadeo Bordiga was elected secretary of the new party.

The party was officially founded as the Communist Party of Italy – Section of the Communist International (&quot;Partito Comunista d&#x27;Italia – Sezione dell&#x27;Internazionale Comunista&quot;), since the Comintern was structured as a single world party according to Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s vision. In the 1921 Italian general election, the party obtained 4.6% of the vote and 15 seats in the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies. At the time, it was an active yet small faction within the Italian political left, which was strongly led by the PSI, while on the international level it was Soviet-led.

During its 2nd Congress in 1922, the new party registered 43,000 members. This was in part due to the entrance of almost the whole Socialist Youth Federation (&quot;Federazione Giovanile Socialista&quot;). The party adopted a slim structure headed by a Central Committee of 15 members, five of whom were also in the Executive Committee (EC), namely Ambrogio Belloni, Nicola Bombacci, Amadeo Bordiga (EC), Bruno Fortichiari (EC), Egidio Gennari, Antonio Gramsci, Ruggero Grieco (EC), Anselmo Marabini, Francesco Misiano, Giovanni Parodi, Luigi Polano, Luigi Repossi (EC), Cesare Sessa, Ludovico Tarsia, and Umberto Terracini (EC).

Since its formation, the party strived to organise itself on some bases that were not a mere reproduction of the traditional parties&#x27; bases. It then took again some arguments that distinguished the battle within the PSI, namely the idea that it is necessary to form an environment fiercely hostile to bourgeois society and that is an anticipation of the future socialist society. The purpose of this was not considered utopian because already in this society, especially in production, some structures are born on future results. In the first years of the PCd&#x27;I, there was no official leader; the accepted leader, first of the faction/tendency and then of the party, was Bordiga (Left) of the communist left current. Leaders of the minority currents were Angelo Tasca (Right) and Gramsci (Centre).

===Conflict between factions===
As a territorial section of Comintern, the PCd&#x27;I adopted the same program, the same conception of the party and the same tactics adopted by the II Congress in Moscow of 1920. The official program, drawn up in ten points, began with the intrinsically catastrophic nature of the capitalist system and terminated with the extinction of the state. It follows in a synthetic way the model outlined by Lenin for the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). For a while, this identity resisted, but the fast progress of the reaction in Europe produced a change of tactics in a democratic direction within the Bolshevik party and consequently within the Comintern. This happened in particular regarding the possibility, previously opposed, of an alliance with the social democratic and bourgeois parties. This provoked a tension in the party between the majority (Left) and the minority factions (the Right and the Centre) supported by the Comintern. The proposals of the Left were no longer accepted and the conflict between the factions became irremediable.

===Bolshevisation===
In 1923, some members of the party were arrested and put on trial for &quot;conspiracy against the State&quot;. This allowed the intense activity of the Communist International to deprive the party&#x27;s left-wing of authority and give control to the minority centre which had aligned with Moscow. In 1924–1925, the Comintern began a campaign of Bolshevisation, which forced each party to conform to the discipline and orders of Moscow. During the clandestine conference held in Como to ratify the party leadership in May 1924, 35 of the 45 federation secretaries, plus the secretary of the youth federation, voted for Bordiga&#x27;s Left, four for Gramsci&#x27;s Centre, and five for Tasca&#x27;s Right.

Before the Lyon Congress in 1926, the Centre won almost all the votes in the absence of much of the Left, who were unable to attend as a result of fascist controls and lack of Comintern support. Recourse to the Comintern against this evident manoeuvre had little effect. The PCd&#x27;I as conceived by the Left terminated. The organisation continued with the support of the Comintern and a new structure and leadership. In 1922, the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; was closed and in 1924 a new Centre newspaper, &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;, edited by Gramsci, was founded. The Left continued as a faction, principally functioning in exile. It published the newspaper &quot;Bilan&quot;, a monthly theoretical bulletin.

In 1926, Bordiga and Gramsci were arrested and imprisoned on the island of Ustica. In 1927, Palmiro Togliatti was elected secretary in place of Gramsci. In 1930, Bordiga was expelled from the Comintern and accused of Trotskyism. After Joseph Stalin dissolved the Communist International in 1943, the exiled members of the PCd&#x27;I in Moscow changed the party&#x27;s name to the PCI on 15 May. Under this name, it reorganised in Italy and became a parliamentary party after the fall of Fascism.

===Resistance to fascism===
The party and its militants were actively involved in the resistance to Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime through clandestine action. They were well prepared for clandestine activity because of the structure of their organisation, and the fact that they had been victims of systematic repression by the authorities; more than three quarters of the political prisoners between 1926 and 1943 were communists. Throughout the dictatorship, the party was able to maintain and feed a clandestine network, distribute propaganda leaflets and newspapers, and infiltrate fascist unions and youth organisations. In 1935, the party led a campaign against the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The party and communist partisans, among others, then went on to play a major role in the resistance movement that led to the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy.

On 15 May 1943, the party changed its official name to the Italian Communist Party (&quot;Partito Comunista Italiano&quot;), often shortened to PCI. This change was not surprising as PCI started being used as the party&#x27;s acronym around 1924–1925. This name change also reflected a change in the Comintern&#x27;s role—it increasingly became a federation of national communist parties. This trend accelerated after Lenin&#x27;s death and its new name emphasised the party&#x27;s shift from an international focus to an Italian one. At the time, it was a hotly contested issue for the two major factions of the party. On one side, the Leninist preferred the single world party as it was internationalist and strongly centralised, while on the other side the Italians wanted a party more tailored to their nation&#x27;s peculiarities and more autonomy.

After the fall of Fascist Italy on 25 July 1943, the PCI returned to a formally legal status, playing a major role during the national liberation, known in Italy as &quot;Resistenza&quot; (Resistance) and forming many partisan groups. In April 1944, after the &quot;Svolta di Salerno&quot; (Salerno&#x27;s turning point), Togliatti, who had returned to Italy the month prior after 18 years of exile, agreed to cooperate with King Victor Emmanuel III and his prime minister of Italy, the Marshal Pietro Badoglio. After the turn, the PCI took part in every government during the national liberation and constitutional period from June 1944 to May 1947. Their contribution to the new Italian democratic constitution was decisive. The Gullo decrees of 1944, named after Fausto Gullo, sought to improve social and economic conditions in the countryside. During Badoglio and Ferruccio Parri&#x27;s cabinets, Togliatti served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy. During the Resistance, the PCI became increasingly popular, as the majority of partisans were communists. The Garibaldi Brigades, promoted by the PCI, were among the more numerous partisan forces.

===Post-war years===
The PCI took part in the 1946 Italian general election and the 1946 Italian institutional referendum, campaigning for a republic. In the election, the PCI was third, behind Christian Democracy (DC) and the PSI, gaining almost 19% of votes and electing 104 members of the Constituent Assembly of Italy. The popular referendum resulted in the replacement of the monarchy with a republic, after 54% of the votes were in favour and 46% against. Luciano Canfora saw the Salerno Turn and 1944 as a rebirth of the PCI, and said &quot;the PCI had gradually followed a path which required it, as a historical task, to occupy the space of social democracy in the Italian political panorama.&quot;

As part of the May 1947 crises, the PCI was excluded from government. Alcide De Gasperi, the DC leader and prime minister of Italy, was losing popularity, and feared that the leftist coalition would take power. While the PCI was growing particularly fast due to its organising efforts supporting sharecroppers in Sicily, Tuscany, and Umbria, movements that were also bolstered by the reforms of Fausto Gullo, the Italian Minister of Agriculture. On 1 May, the nation was thrown into crisis by the Portella della Ginestra massacre, in which eleven leftist peasants (including four children) were murdered at an International Workers&#x27; Day parade in Palermo by Salvatore Giuliano and his gang. In the political chaos that ensued, the United States government engineered the expulsion of all left-wing ministers from the cabinet on 31 May. The PCI would not have a national position in government again. De Gasperi did this under pressure from the United States Secretary of State, George Marshall, who had informed him that anti-communism was a pre-condition for receiving American aid, and Ambassador James Clement Dunn, who had directly asked de Gasperi to dissolve the parliament and remove the PCI.

In the 1948 Italian general election, the party joined the PSI in the Popular Democratic Front (FDP) but was defeated by the DC. The United States government provided support to anti-PCI groups in the election, and argued that should the PCI win, the Marshall Plan and other aids could be terminated. It spent $10–20 million on anti-communist propaganda and other covert operations, much of it through the Economic Cooperation Administration of the Marshall Plan, and then laundered through individual banks. Fearful of the possible FDP&#x27;s electoral victory, the British and American governments also undermined their campaign for legal justice by tolerating the efforts made by Italy&#x27;s top authorities to prevent any of the alleged Italian war criminals from being extradited and taken to court. The denial of Italian war crimes was backed up by the Italian state, academe, and media, re-inventing Italy as only a victim of Nazism and the post-war Foibe massacres.

The party gained considerable electoral success during the following years and occasionally supplied external support to the Organic centre-left governments, although it never directly joined a government. It successfully lobbied Fiat to set up the AvtoVAZ (Lada) car factory in the Soviet Union (1966). The party did best in Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, and Umbria, where it regularly won the local administrative elections, and in some of the industrialised cities of Northern Italy. At the city government level during the course of the post-war period, the PCI demonstrated in cities like Bologna and Florence their capacity for uncorrupt, efficient and clean government. After the 1975 Italian local elections, the PCI was the strongest force in nearly all of the municipal councils of the great cities.

===From the 1950s to the 1960s===
The Soviet Union&#x27;s brutal suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 created a split within the PCI. The party leadership, including Palmiro Togliatti and Giorgio Napolitano (who in 2006 became President of Italy), regarded the Hungarian insurgents as counter-revolutionaries as reported at the time in &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;, the official PCI newspaper. Giuseppe Di Vittorio, chief of the communist trade union Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), repudiated the leadership position, as did prominent party member Antonio Giolitti and Italian Socialist Party national secretary Pietro Nenni, a close ally of the PCI. Napolitano later hinted at doubts over the propriety of his decision. He would eventually write in &quot;From the Communist Party to European Socialism. A Political Autobiography&quot; (&quot;Dal Pci al socialismo europeo. Un&#x27;autobiografia politica&quot;) that he regretted his justification of the Soviet intervention but quieted his concerns at the time for the sake of party unity and the international leadership of Soviet Communism. Giolitti and Nenni went on to split with the PCI over this issue. Napolitano became a leading member of the &quot;miglioristi&quot; faction within the PCI that promoted a social-democratic direction in party policy.

In the mid-1960s, the United States Department of State estimated the party membership to be approximately 1,350,000, or 4.2% of the working age population, making it the largest Communist party in per capita terms in the capitalist world at the time and the largest party at all in the whole of Western Europe with the Social Democratic Party of Germany. United States government sources said that the party was receiving $40–50 million per year from the Soviets when their investment in Italy was $5–6 million. Although the PCI relied on Soviet financial assistance more than any other Communist party supported by Moscow, declassified information shows this to be exaggerated.

According to the former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin, Longo and other PCI leaders became alarmed at the possibility of a coup in Italy after the Athens Colonel coup in April 1967 that led to the Greek junta. These fears were not completely unfounded as there had been two attempted coups in Italy, Piano Solo in 1964 and Golpe Borghese in 1970, by military and neo-fascist groups. The PCI&#x27;s Giorgio Amendola formally requested Soviet assistance to prepare the party in case of such an event. The KGB drew up and implemented a plan to provide the PCI with its own intelligence and clandestine signal corps. From 1967 through 1973, PCI members were sent to East Germany and Moscow to receive training in clandestine warfare and information gathering techniques by both the Stasi and the KGB. Shortly before the 1972 Italian general election, Longo personally wrote to Leonid Brezhnev asking for and receiving an additional $5.7 million in funding. This was on top of the $3.5 million that the Soviet Union gave the PCI in 1971. The Soviets also provided additional funding through the use of front organisations providing generous contracts to PCI members.

===Leadership of Enrico Berlinguer===
In 1969, Enrico Berlinguer, the PCI deputy national secretary and later secretary general, took part in the international conference of the communist parties in Moscow, where his delegation disagreed with the official political line and refused to support the final report. Unexpectedly to his hosts, his speech challenged the communist leadership in Moscow. He refused to excommunicate the Chinese Communist Party and directly told Brezhnev that the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, which he called &quot;the tragedy in Prague&quot;, had made clear the considerable differences within the communist movement on fundamental questions, such as national sovereignty, socialist democracy, and the freedom of culture. At the time, the PCI, which had absorbed the PSI&#x27;s left-wing, the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity, so strengthening its leadership over the Italian left, was the largest communist party in a capitalist state, garnering 34.4% of the vote in the 1976 Italian general election.

Relationships between the PCI and the Soviet Union gradually fell apart as the party moved away from Soviet obedience and Marxist–Leninist orthodoxy in the 1970s and 1980s and toward Eurocommunism and the Socialist International. The PCI sought a collaboration with the socialist and Christian democracy parties, a policy known the Historic Compromise. The kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro, the DC leader, by the Red Brigades in May 1978 put an end to any hopes of such a compromise. The compromise was largely abandoned as a PCI policy in 1981. The Proletarian Unity Party merged into the PCI in 1984.

During the Years of Lead, the PCI strongly opposed the terrorism and the Red Brigades, who in turn murdered or wounded many PCI members or trade unionists close to the PCI. According to Mitrokhin, the party asked the Soviets to pressure the StB, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s State Security, to withdraw their support to the group, which Moscow was unable or unwilling to do. This, along with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, led to a complete break with Moscow in 1979. In 1980, the PCI refused to participate in the international conference of Communist parties in Paris; cash payments to the PCI continued until 1984.

===Dissolution===
Achille Occhetto became general secretary of the PCI in 1988. At a 1989 conference in a working-class section of Bologna, Occhetto stunned the party faithful with a speech heralding the Revolutions of 1989, a move now referred to in Italian politics as the &quot;svolta della Bolognina&quot; (Bolognina turning point). The collapse of the Communist governments in the Eastern Europe led Occhetto to conclude that the era of Eurocommunism was over. Under his leadership, the PCI dissolved and refounded itself as the Democratic Party of the Left, which branded itself as a progressive left-wing and democratic socialist party. A third of the PCI membership, led by Armando Cossutta, refused to join the PDS, and instead seceded to form the Communist Refoundation Party.

==Popular support==
In all its history, the PCI was particularly strong in Central Italy, in the Red Regions of Emilia-Romagna, Marche, Tuscany, and Umbria, as well as in the industrialised cities of Northern Italy. The party&#x27;s municipal showcase was Bologna, which was held continuously by the PCI from 1945 onwards. Amongst other measures, the local PCI administration tackled urban problems with successful programmes of health for the elderly, nursery education and traffic reform, while also undertaking initiatives in housing and school meal provisions.

Communist administrations at a local level helped to aid new businesses while also introducing innovative social reforms. From 1946 to 1956, the Communist city council built 31 nursery schools, 896 flats, and 9 schools. Health care improved substantially, street lighting was installed, new drains and municipal launderettes were built and 8,000 children received subsidised school meals. In 1972, the then-mayor of Bologna, Renato Zangheri, introduced a new and innovative traffic plan with strict limitations for private vehicles and a renewed concentration on cheap public transport. Bologna&#x27;s social services continued to expand throughout the early and mid-1970s. The city centre was restored, centres for the mentally sick were instituted to help those who had been released from recently closed psychiatric hospitals, handicapped persons were offered training and found suitable jobs, afternoon activities for schoolchildren were made less mindless than the traditional &quot;doposcuola&quot; (after-school activities), and school programming for the whole day helped working parents.

<doc id="251567" wikidata="Q140575" url="?curid=251567" title="Zahi Hawass">
<text>Zahi Abass Hawass (; born May 28, 1947) is an Egyptian archaeologist, Egyptologist, and former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, a position he held twice. He has worked at archaeological sites in the Nile Delta, the Western Desert and the Upper Nile Valley.

==Early life==
Hawass was born in a small village near Damietta, Egypt. Although he originally dreamed of becoming an attorney, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Greek and Roman Archaeology from Alexandria University in 1967. In 1979, Hawass earned a diploma in Egyptology from Cairo University. He then worked at the Great Pyramids as an inspector—a combination of administrator and archaeologist.

When he was 33 years old, Hawass was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to attend the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia to study Egyptology, earning a Master of Arts degree in the subject and also one in Syro-Palestinian Archaeology in 1983, and his PhD in Egyptology in 1987 from the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World (AAMW), concentrating on &quot;The Funerary Establishments of Khufu, Khafra and Menkaura During the Old Kingdom.&quot;

==Career==
=== Archaeology and early government career ===
Hawass was Associate Director of Excavation at Hermopolis in 1968 and Tarrana 1970–74. Since 1975, he has been Excavation Director and Restoration Director at various sites throughout Egypt, predominantly Giza.

From 1969 to 1975, Hawass was Inspector of Antiquities for a multitude of archaeological expeditions, for instance the Yale Expedition at Abydos, Egypt in 1969, and Abu Simbel between 1972 and 1974.

He sporadically taught Egyptian archaeology and history and culture at universities in Egypt and the USA between 1988 and 2001, most notably at the American University in Cairo, the University of California, Los Angeles and Alexandria University. Hawass has described his efforts as trying to help institute a systematic program for the preservation and restoration of historical monuments, while training Egyptians to improve their expertise on methods of excavation, retrieval and preservation.

==== Giza ====

Hawass was Inspector of Antiquities for Giza 1972–74, First Inspector until 1979 and Chief Inspector in 1980. Starting in 1987, he held the position of Director General of the Giza monuments, which included the sites of Giza, Saqqara, Memphis, Dahshur, Abusir and Bahariya Oasis.

After the discovery of Gantenbrink&#x27;s Door in 1993, he left the position – according to Hawass, a resignation – but was reinstated several months later, following a change in leadership and the transformation of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization into the Supreme Council of Antiquities.

He was promoted to Undersecretary of the State for the Giza Monuments in 1998.

Hawass continues to be involved in archaeological projects at Giza and other sites in Egypt. , he headed the science committee overseeing the ScanPyramids project.

=== Politics ===
In 2002, Hawass was appointed as the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. When US President Barack Obama visited Cairo in June 2009, Hawass gave him personal tours of ancient Egyptian archaeological sites. Facing mandatory retirement, he was promoted by President Hosni Mubarak to the post of Vice Minister of Culture at the end of 2009.

====2011 protest vandalism====
On January 29, 2011, in the midst of the Egyptian protests of that year, Hawass arrived at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo to find that a number of cases had been broken into and a number of antiquities damaged, so police were brought in to secure the museum. According to Andrew Lawler, reporting for &quot;Science&quot;, Hawass said that he &quot;faxed a colleague in Italy that 13 cases were destroyed. My heart is broken and my blood is boiling&quot;.

Hawass later told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that thieves looking for gold broke 70 objects, including two sculptures of the pharaoh Tutankhamun and took two skulls from a research lab, before being stopped as they left the museum.

====Minister of Antiquities====
Hawass was appointed to the position of Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs, a newly created cabinet post, by Mubarak on January 31, 2011, as part of a cabinet shake-up during the 2011 protests. A press release including a statement from Hawass stated that he &quot;will continue excavating, writing books, and representing his country,&quot; ensuring that archaeological sites in Egypt were being safeguarded and looted objects returned. Regarding the Egyptian Museum looting, he said: &quot;The museum was dark and the nine robbers did not recognise the value of what was in the vitrines. They opened thirteen cases, threw the seventy objects on the ground and broke them, including one Tutankhamun case, from which they broke the statue of the king on a panther. However, the broken objects can all be restored, and we will begin the restoration process this week.&quot; Hawass rejected comparisons with the looting of antiquities in Iraq and Afghanistan.

On February 13, Mahmoud Kassem of &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported Hawass as saying that &quot;18 artifacts, including statues of King Tutankhamun&quot;, were stolen from the Egyptian Museum in January; Kassem, paraphrasing Hawass, continues: &quot;The missing objects include 11 wooden shabti statuettes from Yuya, a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamun carried by a goddess and a statue of Nefertiti making offerings&quot;.

Egyptian state television reported that Hawass called upon Egyptians not to believe the “lies and fabrications” of the Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya satellite television channels. Hawass later said: “They should give us the opportunity to change things, and if nothing happens they can march again. But you can’t bring in a new president now, in this time. We need Mubarak to stay and make the transition”. On March 3, 2011, he resigned after a list was posted on his personal website of dozens of sites across Egypt that were looted during the 2011 protests.

Hawass was reappointed Minister of Antiquities by then-Prime Minister Essam Sharaf. On March 30, 2011, a tweet was posted, stating: &quot;I am very happy to be the Minister of Antiquities once again!&quot; but resigned on July 17, 2011, after Sharaf informed him he would not be continuing in the position. According to opinion report from an Egyptian commentator in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Hawass was &quot;sacked&quot;.

=== Claimed discoveries ===

As his biography at the National Geographic Explorers webpage notes, he states that he is

==Appearances==
Hawass has appeared on television specials on channels such as the &quot;National Geographic Channel&quot;, the &quot;History Channel&quot; and the &quot;Discovery Channel&quot;. Hawass has also appeared in several episodes of the U.S. television show &quot;Digging for the Truth&quot;, discussing mummies, the pyramids, Tutankhamun, Cleopatra and Ramesses II. He also appeared on &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; during a segment on the curse of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. In 2010, Hawass appeared on a reality-based television show on The History Channel called &quot;Chasing Mummies&quot;.

Hawass also worked alongside Egyptologist Otto Schaden during the opening of Tomb KV63 in February 2006 – the first intact tomb to be found in the Valley of the Kings since 1922.

In June 2007, Hawass announced that he and a team of experts may have identified the mummy of Hatshepsut, in KV60, a small tomb in the Valley of the Kings. The opening of the sealed tomb was described in 2006 as &quot;one of the most important events in the Valley of the Kings for almost a hundred years.&quot;

Hawass was interviewed about his work by Keith Floyd as part of his television series &quot;Floyd around the Med&quot; in the episode &quot;Cairo, Egypt and Aswan to Luxor&quot; (2000).

Hawass was the host of the documentary &quot;Egypt&#x27;s Ten Greatest Discoveries&quot;.

==Views==
===Return of artifacts to Egypt===
Hawass has repeatedly spearheaded movements to return many prominent and irregularly taken Ancient Egyptian artifacts back to Egypt from collections in various other countries. Examples of these artifacts include: the Rosetta Stone, the bust of Nefertiti, the Dendera zodiac ceiling painting from the Dendera Temple, the bust of Ankhhaf (the architect of the Khafre Pyramid), the faces of Amenhotep III&#x27;s tomb at the Louvre Museum, the Luxor Temple&#x27;s obelisk at the Place de la Concorde and the statue of Hemiunu.

In July 2003, the Egyptians requested the return of the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum. Hawass, then serving as Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo, spoke at a press conference saying: &quot;If the British want to be remembered, if they want to restore their reputation, they should volunteer to return the Rosetta Stone because it is the icon of our Egyptian identity&quot;. Referring to Egyptian antiquities at the British Museum, Hawass said: &quot;These are Egyptian monuments. I will make life miserable for anyone who keeps them&quot;.

In 2019, Hawass relaunched his restitution campaign, asking the Berlin State Museums, the British Museum and the Musée du Louvre: “How can you refuse to lend to the new Grand Egyptian Museum when you have taken so many antiquities from Egypt?&quot; All three museums refused his loan requests.

In 2022, Hawass launched another petition, calling once again for the return of the Rosetta Stone, the bust of Nefertiti and the Dendera Zodiac ceiling to Egypt.

===DNA testing of Egyptian mummies===
Hawass has been skeptical of the DNA testing of Egyptian mummies: &quot;From what I understand,&quot; he has said, &quot;it is not always accurate and it cannot always be done with complete success when dealing with mummies. Until we know for sure that it is accurate, we will not use it in our research.&quot;

In December 2000, a joint team from Waseda University in Japan and Cairo&#x27;s Ain Shams University tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian mummies, but was denied by the Egyptian Government. Hawass stated at the time that DNA analysis was out of the question because it would not lead to anything.

In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of Tutankhamun and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture. German researchers Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer have cast doubt on this theory, suggesting other possible alternatives for Tutankhamun&#x27;s cause of death.

In 2012, a study signed by Hawass disclosed that Ramses III may have had a haplogroup E1b1a that most dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, and it also occurs at moderate frequencies in North Africa, West Asia, and Southern Europe.

A 2020 study by Gad, Hawass, et al. analysed mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroups from Tutankhamun&#x27;s family members of the 18th Dynasty, using comprehensive control procedures to ensure quality results. The study found that the Y-chromosome haplogroup of the family was R1b. Haplogroup R1b is carried by modern Egyptians. Modern Egypt is also the only African country that is known to harbor all three R1 subtypes, including R1b-M269. While mitochondrial linage was found to be on K and H2b, both haplogroups did not originate in Africa yet it exists in both Ancient and Modern Egyptians.

=== On Afrocentrism ===
Hawass refutes Afrocentrist Claims of Ancient Egyptian history, he explained “We are not against Black people at all, but we are against this group that entered the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir to announce ideas that have no basis in truth and are fantasies”, that after a group of Afrocentric travel group was founded to be falsifying history in the Egyptian Museum. he added &quot;“There is a very important fact Afrocentrists need to know: the depictions on Egyptian temples from the Old Kingdom to the end of the Late Period show the King of Egypt and in front of him are captives from Africa, Libya, Syria, and Palestine,” he said referring to Ramses III Prisoner tiles among other evidence that show the difference between Egyptians and their neighbors.

Following Netflix&#x27;s Cleopatra controversy, Hawas appeared in a 90-minute documentary &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, released on director Curtis Ryan Woodside&#x27;s YouTube channel, describes itself as telling the &quot;true&quot; story of the Ptolemaic dynasty&#x27;s last ruler. &quot;Was Cleopatra black? First of all, I have nothing against black people at all, but I am stating the facts -- look at the Macedonian queens, none of them were black&quot;, Hawass, says in the documentary. Yet he criticized the lawsuit against Netflix over the film stating “We can’t make a case against the Netflix platform, because we will definitely lose as they have the right to broadcast as long as it is a matter of freedom of opinion, and we can make a movie that overshadows everything they did.. but our case against them will not be successful.” he also pointed out, “Two years ago, Mostafa Waziri (the Supreme Council of Antiquities) and I worked with the Netflix platform on the archaeological discoveries in Saqqara, and the film has been translated into 129 languages and will be released soon. They broadcast all the work.”

In 2023, after ending his lecture about ancient Egypt at Columbus, Ohio, Zahi Hawass asked the audience whether they have any questions. An Afro-American woman stood up and asked: “Why do you attack us?”. He said “When the woman asked me this question, I replied, ‘No I didn’t attack you, but let’s discuss the evidence that refutes the claim of ancient Egypt’s black African origins’,” and he went on explaining and providing evidence that Ancient Egyptian civilization is Egyptian made not African made, “African countries and Egypt share the same Nile. But the ancient Egyptian civilization occurred here in Egypt, not in any other African country,” said Hawass “The granite came from Aswan, diorite from Nubia, sandstone from Kom Ombo, alabaster from Het-Nub in Middle Egypt, white limestone from Tura, basalt from Fayoum and turquoise and copper from Sinai. Egypt also has plenty of gold,” he explained.

=== Aliens and the Pyramids ===
Hawas criticized a tweet by US billionaire Elon Musk claiming that aliens built the pyramids, he stated in TV interview that that studying ancient Egyptian civilization provides a comprehensive understanding of its secrets. “Elon Musk’s comment on the pyramids indicates his lack of knowledge about the history of Egyptian civilization,” he said. He noted that there are those who spread false rumors about ancient Egyptian civilization to gain attention, stressing: “Anyone who doubts Egyptian civilization, I will confront them. I am holding a stick for anyone who spreads these false rumors.” Hawas often refer to Merer Papyrus and Tombs of pyramids builders as the biggest evidence on the fact that the pyramids were built by Egyptian workers.

=== Biblical and Quranic stories ===
Hawass said that the archeology and antiquities do not contain proof that Moses or Joseph lived in Egypt or the exodus of the Israelites from it. He said, “I am a Muslim who believes that our Master Moses lived in Egypt and that the exodus occurred from Egypt, but on the other hand, is there evidence in the antiquities that prove this? The answer is no&quot;. Hawass also asserted that there is no archeological evidence confirming the identity of the pharaoh who ruled during the arrival of the Prophets Moses and Joseph to Egypt, adding that information currently available on the issue is limited to guesses and speculation.

==Controversies==

===Relationships with other archaeologists===
Hawass has been accused of domineering behaviour, forbidding archaeologists to announce their own findings and courting the media for his own gain after they were denied access to archaeological sites because, according to Hawass, they were too amateurish. A few, however, have said in interviews that some of what Hawass has done for the field was long overdue. Hawass has typically ignored or dismissed his critics and, when asked about it, he indicated that what he does is for the sake of Egypt and the preservation of its antiquities.

===Views on Jews and Israel===
Hawass has been a long-standing opponent of normalised relations between Israel and Egypt. In January 2009, Hawass wrote in &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot;: &quot;The concept of killing women, children, and elderly people ... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of Palestine&quot; and that &quot;the only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and torment—so much so that they have become artists in this field.&quot; He explained that he was not referring to the Jews&#x27; &quot;[original] faith&quot; but rather &quot;the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison, which is aimed against all of mankind.&quot; In an interview on Egyptian television in April 2009, Hawass stated that &quot;although Jews are few in number, they control the entire world&quot; and commented on the &quot;control they have&quot; of the American economy and the media. He later wrote that he was using rhetoric to explain political fragmentation among the Arabs, and that he does not believe in a &quot;Jewish conspiracy to control the world&quot;.

Nevertheless, Zahi Hawass aided the Egyptian government on renovating an old dilapidated synagogue in what was once a Jewish neighborhood in Old Cairo, stating: &quot;If you don&#x27;t restore the Jewish synagogues, you lose part of your history.&quot;

===Aftermath of 2011 protests===
Criticism of Hawass, in Egypt and more broadly, increased following the protests in Egypt in 2011. On July 12, 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Hawass receives an honorarium each year &quot;of as much as $200,000 from &quot;National Geographic&quot; to be an explorer-in-residence even as he controls access to the ancient sites it often features in its reports.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; also reported that he has relationships with two American companies that do business in Egypt.

On April 17, 2011, Hawass was sentenced to jail for one year for refusing to obey a court ruling relating to a contract for the gift shop at the Egyptian Museum to a company with links to Hawass. The ruling was appealed and this specific sentence was suspended pending appeal. The following day, the National Council of Egypt&#x27;s Administrative Court issued a decree to overturn the court&#x27;s original ruling, specifying that he would serve no jail time, and would instead remain in his position as Minister of Antiquities. The jail sentence was lifted after a new contract was solicited for the running of the gift shop.

===Association with Mubarak===
As Minister of Antiquities, Hawass was closely associated with the government of former President Hosni Mubarak. His resignation as minister on March 3, 2011, and his re-appointment to the Ministry on March 30, 2011, have been seen as part of the overall events surrounding Mubarak&#x27;s resignation. It was reported that his re-appointment angered numerous factions, who opposed the appointment of any of the old guard under Mubarak to new positions in the government. The 2011 Egyptian protests resulted in increased criticism of Hawass. Demonstrators called for his resignation, and the upheaval increased attention on his relationship with the Mubarak family and the way in which he has increased his public profile in recent years.

===Commercial endeavours===
Hawass has lent his name to a line of men&#x27;s apparel, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a line of rugged khakis, denim shirts and carefully worn leather jackets that are meant, according to the catalog copy, to hark &quot;back to Egypt’s golden age of discovery in the early 20th century&quot;; the clothing was first sold at Harrods department store in London, in April 2011. Critics say the Hawass clothing commercializes Egyptian history, and objected to their understanding that &quot;models had sat on or scuffed priceless ancient artifacts during the photo shoot&quot;, an accusation that was denied by Hawass and the clothing manufacturers. Hawass already sells a line of Stetson hats reproducing the ones he wears, which &quot;very much resemble&quot; the ones worn by Harrison Ford in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies.
== Personal life ==
Hawas is married to Fekrya Hawas, a gynecologist whom he met in 1967. they have two grown sons, one a physician, the other a restaurateur, both living in Cairo.

He was a close friend with actor Omar Sharif and accompanied him in his final days until his death in 2015. in 2020, Hawas posted an Instagram post remembering his friend &quot;yesterday I remembered my dear friend Omar El-Sherif who was born on April 10th. We used to celebrate together and I would sing for him the song by Marilyn Monroe celebrating the birthday of President JF Kennedy and he would sing the same song to me on my birthday.&quot;

Hawas was a friend of Jehan Sadat, the former First Lady of Egypt. Hawas and Sadat organized &quot;private tour of the country’s pharaonic sites&quot; for guests for years until her death in 2021, &quot;Her charisma was electrifying to an extent that when she spoke the audience would be so silent you could hear a pin drop&quot; Hawas said remembering her.

Hawass is often mistaken for being a Coptic Christian because of his name, even though he is Muslim.
==Honors and awards==
Hawass is the recipient of the Egyptian state award of the first degree for his work in the Sphinx restoration project. In 2001, he was silver medallist offered by the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. In 2002, he was awarded the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate and the glass obelisk from US scholars for his efforts to the protection and preservation of Ancient Egyptian monuments. In 2003, Hawass was given international membership in the Russian Academy for Natural Sciences (RANS) and, in 2006, he was chosen as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people by &quot;Time&quot;. In 2015, he was awarded the Golden Memorial Medal of Charles University. In 2018, he was awarded by the Academia Brasileira de Letras for being the only archaeologist who wrote more than 30 books. In the same year, he received the Presidential Medal of the Republic of Kosovo in recognition for his entire academic output. Also in 2018, he received the grand prize of the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Culture. In 2022, he received the plaque of honour from the Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences of Cairo.

Hawass has received many honorary degrees. From outside Egypt, he has received honorary doctorates from the University of Pennsylvania (2000), the University of Lisbon (2011), the Chandrakasem Rajabhat University (2011), the New Bulgarian University (2016), the Universidad Católica Santo Domingo (2016), the Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola (2017) and the Russian State University for the Humanities (2021).

<text>The Beckmann rearrangement, named after the German chemist Ernst Otto Beckmann (1853–1923), is a rearrangement of an oxime functional group to substituted amides. The rearrangement has also been successfully performed on haloimines and nitrones. Cyclic oximes and haloimines yield lactams.

The Beckmann rearrangement is often catalyzed by acid; however, other reagents have been known to promote the rearrangement. These include tosyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus pentoxide, triethylamine, sodium hydroxide, trimethylsilyl iodide among others. The Beckmann fragmentation is another reaction that often competes with the rearrangement, though careful selection of promoting reagent and solvent conditions can favor the formation of one over the other, sometimes giving almost exclusively one product. The rearrangement occurs stereospecifically for ketoximes and N-chloro/N-fluoro imines, with the migrating group being anti-periplanar to the leaving group on the nitrogen. Certain conditions have been known to racemize the oxime geometry, leading to the formation of both regioisomers. The rearrangement of aldoximes occurs with stereospecificity in the gas phase and without stereospecificity in the solution phase. A few methodologies allow for the rearrangement of aldoximes to primary amides, but fragmentation commonly competes in these systems. Nitrone rearrangement also occurs without stereospecificity; the regioisomer formed has the amide nitrogen substituted with the group possessing the greatest migratory aptitude.

The archetypal Beckmann rearrangement is the conversion of cyclohexanone to caprolactam via the oxime. Caprolactam is the feedstock in the production of Nylon 6.

The Beckmann solution consists of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and acetic anhydride, and was widely used to catalyze the rearrangement. Other acids, such as sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, and hydrogen fluoride have all been used. Sulfuric acid is the most commonly used acid for commercial lactam production due to its formation of an ammonium sulfate by-product when neutralized with ammonia. Ammonium sulfate is a common agricultural fertilizer providing nitrogen and sulfur.

== Reaction mechanism ==
The most common reaction mechanism of the Beckmann rearrangement consists generally of an alkyl migration anti-periplanar to the expulsion of a leaving group to form a nitrilium ion. This is followed by solvolysis to an imidate and then tautomerization to the amide:

This nitrilium ion has been known to be intercepted by other nucleophiles, including the leaving group from the oxime.

Presumably after the phenyl group migrates and expels the cyanate, the latter then attacks the nitrilium ion formed. In carbon tetrachloride the isocyanate can be isolated, whereas in ethanol, the urethane is formed after solvolysis of the isocyanate.

One computational study has established the mechanism accounting for solvent molecules and substituents. The rearrangement of acetone oxime in the Beckmann solution involved three acetic acid molecules and one proton (present as an oxonium ion). In the transition state leading to the iminium ion (σ-complex), the methyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom in a concerted reaction as the hydroxyl group is expelled. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is stabilized by three acetic acid molecules. In the next step the electrophilic carbon atom in the nitrilium ion is attacked by water and a proton is donated back to acetic acid. In the transition state leading to the imidate, the water oxygen atom is coordinated to 4 other atoms. In the third step, an isomerization step protonates the nitrogen atom leading to the amide.

The same computation with a hydroxonium ion and 6 molecules of water has the same result, but when the migrating substituent is a phenyl group, the mechanism favors the formation of an intermediate three-membered π-complex. This π-complex is not found in the H3O+(H2O)6.

With the cyclohexanone-oxime, the relief of ring strain results in a third reaction mechanism, leading directly to the protonated caprolactam in a single concerted step without the intermediate formation of a π-complex or σ-complex.

== Cyanuric chloride assisted Beckmann reaction==
Beckmann rearrangement can be rendered catalytic using cyanuric chloride and zinc chloride as a co-catalyst. For example, cyclododecanone can be converted to the corresponding lactam, the monomer used in the production of Nylon 12.

The reaction mechanism for this reaction is based on a catalytic cycle with cyanuric chloride activating the hydroxyl group via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction product is dislodged and replaced by new reactant via an intermediate Meisenheimer complex.
== Beckmann fragmentation ==
The Beckmann fragmentation is a reaction that frequently competes with the Beckmann rearrangement. When the group α to the oxime is capable of stabilizing carbocation formation, the fragmentation becomes a viable reaction pathway. The reaction generates a nitrile and a carbocation, which is quickly intercepted to form a variety of products. The nitrile can also be hydrolyzed under reaction conditions to give carboxylic acids. Different reaction conditions can favor the fragmentation over the rearrangement.
Quaternary carbon centers promote fragmentation by stabilizing carbocation formation through hyperconjugation. As shown in the above picture, the &quot;stable&quot; carbocation is formed, which then loses a hydrogen to give a site of unsaturation. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms also promote fragmentation through the formation of ketones and imines respectively.

Sulfur is also capable of promoting fragmentation, albeit at a longer range than oxygen or nitrogen.

Silicon is capable of directing the fragmentation through the beta-silicon effect.

The carbocation intermediate in this reaction is intercepted by nucleophilic fluoride from diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST):

== Semmler–Wolff reaction==
The oxime of cyclohexenone with acid forms aniline in a dehydration – aromatization reaction called the Semmler–Wolff reaction or Wolff aromatization 

The mechanism can be shown as below:

The reaction is intrinsically a special case of the Beckmann rearrangement combined with neighbouring group participation.

==Applications in drug synthesis==
An industrial synthesis of paracetamol developed by Hoechst–Celanese involves the conversion of a methyl ketone to an acetanilide via a Beckmann rearrangement.

The thermal rearrangement that occurs in the synthesis of ketamine was claimed to be a Beckmann rearrangement according to: url.

<doc id="251572" wikidata="Q28106902" url="?curid=251572" title="Garganey">
<text>The garganey (Spatula querquedula) is a small dabbling duck. It breeds in much of Europe and across the Palearctic, but is strictly migratory, with the entire population moving to Africa, India (in particular Santragachi), Bangladesh (in the natural reservoirs of Sylhet district) and Australasia during the winter of the Northern hemisphere, where large flocks can occur. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Like other small ducks such as the Eurasian teal, this species rises easily from the water with a fast twisting wader-like flight.

Their breeding habitat is grassland adjacent to shallow marshes and steppe lakes.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of the garganey was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He introduced the binomial name &quot;Anas querquedula&quot;. A molecular phylogentic study comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2009 found that the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, as then defined, was non-monophyletic. The genus was subsequently split into four monophyletic genera with ten species including the garganey moved into the resurrected genus &quot;Spatula&quot;. This genus had been originally proposed by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The name &quot;Spatula&quot; is the Latin for a &quot;spoon&quot; or &quot;spatula&quot;. The specific epithet is derived from Latin &quot;querquedula&quot;, a word believed to represent to its call.

The common English name dates from the 17th century and comes from Lombard language &quot;gargenei&quot;, the plural of &quot;garganell&quot;, which ultimately comes from the Late Latin &quot;gargala&quot; &quot;tracheal artery&quot;. The English usage owes its origins to Conrad Gesner who used the Italian name in the third volume of his &quot;Historiae Animalium&quot; (History of Animals) of 1555.

==Description==
The adult male is unmistakable, with its brown head and breast with a broad white crescent over the eye. The rest of the plumage is grey, with loose grey scapular feathers. It has a grey bill and legs. In flight, it shows a pale blue speculum with a white border. When swimming it will show prominent white edges on its tertials. His crown (anatomy) is dark and his face is reddish brown.

Some care is needed in separating the brown female from the similar common teal, but the stronger face markings and more frequent head-shaking when dabbling are good indicators. Confusion with the female of the blue-winged teal is also possible, but the head and bill shape is different, and the latter species has yellow legs. Pale eyebrow, dark eye line, pale lore spot bordered by a second dark line.

Measurements:

* Size: 41 cm
* Wingspan: 58 – 69 cm.
* Weight: 300–440 g

These birds feed mainly by skimming rather than upending.

The male has a distinctive crackling mating call; the female is rather silent for a female duck, but can manage a feeble &quot;quack&quot;.

Garganey are rare breeding birds in the British Isles, with most breeding in quiet marshes in Norfolk and Suffolk. In Ireland a few pairs breed in County Wexford, and at Lough Beg in County Londonderry, with occasional breeding elsewhere.

The garganey is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. The status of the garganey on the IUCN Red List is least concern.

<text>Can (stylized in all caps) were a German experimental rock band formed in Cologne in 1968 by Holger Czukay (bass, tape editing), Irmin Schmidt (keyboards), Michael Karoli (guitar), and Jaki Liebezeit (drums). They featured several vocalists, including American Malcolm Mooney (1968–70) and Japanese Damo Suzuki (1970–73). They have been hailed as pioneers of the German krautrock scene.

The founding members of Can came from backgrounds in avant-garde music and jazz. They blended elements of psychedelic rock, funk, and musique concrète on influential albums such as &quot;Tago Mago&quot; (1971), &quot;Ege Bamyasi&quot; (1972) and &quot;Future Days&quot; (1973). Can also had commercial success with singles such as &quot;Spoon&quot; (1971) and &quot;I Want More&quot; (1976) reaching national singles charts. Their work has influenced rock, post-punk, and ambient acts.

==History==

===1960s===

Can was formed in Cologne, Germany, in 1968 by Holger Czukay (bass), Irmin Schmidt (keyboard), Jaki Liebezeit (drums) and Michael Karoli (guitar). Czukay and Schmidt were from academic backgrounds, students of the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, and were fascinated by the possibilities of rock and roll. The band initially used the name Inner Space.

In late 1968, the band enlisted the American vocalist Malcolm Mooney. They recorded an album, &quot;Prepare to Meet Thy Pnoom,&quot; but could not find a recording company to release it. They appeared briefly in the 1969 film &quot;&quot; backing the singer Margarete Juvan.

At Mooney&#x27;s suggestion, the band changed their name to Can. Mooney suggested the name for its positive meanings in various languages. Liebezeit later suggested the backronym &quot;communism, anarchism, nihilism&quot;, after an English magazine claimed this was the intended meaning.

Can accepted an invitation from a friend to move into his castle, Schloss Nörvenich, and use it as a recording studio. There, they recorded their debut album, &quot;Monster Movie&quot; (1969). It contained new versions of two songs previously recorded for &quot;Prepared to Meet Thy Pnoom&quot;, &quot;Father Cannot Yell&quot; and &quot;Outside My Door&quot;. &quot;Monster Movie&quot; received acclaim. 

During one live performance, Mooney suffered a mental breakdown, shouting &quot;upstairs, downstairs&quot; for three hours, even after Can had stopped playing. On his psychiatrist&#x27;s advice, he left Can and returned to the US at the end of 1969. Mooney made his last recordings with Can that December. He was replaced in 1970 by a young Japanese traveller, Damo Suzuki, whom Czukay and Liebezeit found busking outside a Munich café and invited to join their performance that night.

===1971–1973===

The next few years saw Can release their most acclaimed works. While their earlier recordings were loosely based on traditional song structures, Can developed a fluid improvisational style. The double album &quot;Tago Mago&quot; (1971) is often seen as groundbreaking, influential and deeply unconventional, based on intensely rhythmic jazz-inspired drumming, improvised guitar and keyboard soloing (frequently intertwining), tape edits as composition, and Suzuki&#x27;s idiosyncratic vocalisms. Czukay said it &quot;was an attempt in achieving a mystery musical world from light to darkness and return&quot;.

In 1971, the band composed the music for the three-part German-language television crime miniseries &quot;Das Messer&quot; (&quot;The Knife&quot;), directed by Rolf von Sydow. The track &quot;Spoon&quot; was used as the theme song and, released as a single, reached number 6 in the German singles chart.

&quot;Tago Mago&quot; was followed in 1972 by &quot;Ege Bamyasi&quot;, a more accessible but still avant-garde record which featured &quot;Spoon&quot; and the catchy &quot;Vitamin C&quot;. Czukay said, &quot;We could achieve an excellent dry and ambient sound... [&quot;Ege Bamyasi&quot;] reflects the group being in a lighter mood.&quot;

It was followed by &quot;Future Days&quot; in 1973, an early example of ambient music that also includes the pop song &quot;Moonshake&quot;. Czukay said, &quot;&#x27;Bel Air&#x27; [the 20-minute track that takes up all of side two on the original &quot;Future Days&quot; LP] showed Can in a state of being an electric symphony group performing a peaceful though sometimes dramatic landscape painting.&quot;

Suzuki left soon after the recording of &quot;Future Days&quot; to marry his German girlfriend, and become a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. Vocals were taken over by Karoli and Schmidt, but after Suzuki&#x27;s departure, fewer of Can&#x27;s tracks featured vocals, as the band experimented with the ambient music it had begun with &quot;Future Days&quot;.

===1974–1979===
&quot;Soon Over Babaluma&quot; from 1974 continued in the ambient style of &quot;Future Days&quot;, but with some of the abrasive edge of &quot;Tago Mago&quot; and &quot;Ege Bamyasi&quot;. In 1975, Can signed with Virgin Records in the UK and EMI/Harvest in West Germany, appearing the same year on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in a memorable performance of &quot;Vernal Equinox&quot; in which Schmidt played one keyboard section with a series of rapid karate chops. Shortly after the appearance Schmidt suffered a broken leg which led to cancellation of the band&#x27;s UK tour.
The later albums, &quot;Landed&quot; (1975) and &quot;Flow Motion&quot; (1976), saw Can moving towards a somewhat more conventional style as its recording technology improved. The disco single &quot;I Want More&quot; from &quot;Flow Motion&quot; became its only hit record outside West Germany. Co-written by live sound mixer Peter Gilmour, it reached No 26 in the UK charts in October 1976, which prompted an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, where Czukay performed with a double bass. In 1977 Can was joined by former Traffic bassist Rosko Gee and percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah, both of whom provided vocals, appearing on the albums &quot;Saw Delight&quot; (1977), &quot;Out of Reach&quot; (1978) and &quot;Can&quot; (1979).

During this period, Czukay was pushed to the fringes of the group&#x27;s activity due to disagreements about the band&#x27;s creative direction and his failure as a bass guitarist to keep up with the growth of the other musicians. Bass guitar was something Czukay had &quot;taken up almost by default&quot; and he readily admitted his limitations on the instrument. After Gee joined Can, Czukay made sounds using shortwave radios, Morse code keys, tape recorders and other sundry objects. He left Can in late 1977 and did not appear on the albums &quot;Out of Reach&quot; or &quot;Can&quot;, although he was involved with production work for the latter album.

===After the split and reunion===
After the split, all the former members were involved in musical projects, often as session musicians for other artists. Czukay recorded several ambient albums and collaborated with David Sylvian among others. Jaki Liebezeit played extensively with bassists Jah Wobble and Bill Laswell, with a drum ensemble called Drums off Chaos and in 2005 with Datenverarbeiter on the online album &quot;Givt&quot;.

In 1986, they briefly reformed, with original vocalist Mooney, to record &quot;Rite Time&quot; (released in 1989). There was a further reunion in 1991 by Karoli, Liebezeit, Mooney and Schmidt to record a track for the Wim Wenders film &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; and in August 1999 by Karoli, Liebezeit and Schmidt with Jono Podmore to record a cover of &quot;The Third Man Theme&quot; for Grönland Records&#x27; compilation album &quot;Pop 2000&quot;. In 1999, the four core members of Can (Karoli, Liebezeit, Schmidt and Czukay) performed live at the same show, although playing separately with their current solo projects (Sofortkontakt, Club Off Chaos, Kumo and U-She respectively). Can have since been the subject of numerous compilations, live albums and samples. In 2004, the band began a series of Super Audio CD remasters of its back catalog, which were finished in 2006.

Karoli died of cancer on 17 November 2001. Liebezeit died of pneumonia on 22 January 2017. Czukay died of natural causes on 5 September 2017. Suzuki died of cancer on 9 February 2024.

== Archive releases ==
Can released a compilation album &quot;Limited Edition&quot; in 1974, and expanded it to a double album &quot;Unlimited Edition&quot; in 1976 from their unreleased studio recordings. &quot;Delay 1968&quot;, released in 1981, was a compilation of unreleased 1968–1969 recordings. &quot;Cannibalism 2&quot;, a compilation album of album and single material, also included one unreleased song, &quot;Melting Away&quot;, from the 1960s.

In 1995, &quot;The Peel Sessions&quot; was released, a compilation of Can recordings at the BBC. In 1999, &quot;Can Box&quot; was released, with a Can video documentary, a concert recording from 1972 and a double live CD compiled by Michael Karoli and later released separately as &quot;Can Live Music (Live 1971–1977)&quot;. Unreleased live music of Can have been also released on the 40th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Tago Mago&quot; in 2011 and 17 LP collection box &quot;Can&quot; in 2014.

&quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;, released in 2012, was overseen by Irmin Schmidt and Daniel Miller, compiled by Schmidt and Jono Podmore, and edited by Podmore.

A series of releases of live recordings began in 2021 and had reached 6 releases as of November 2024, with the recording dates ranging from 1973 to 1977.

==Style==
Can developed a repetitive, rhythmic style with influences of North African music, Stockhausen, and American minimalists such as Steve Reich and Terry Riley. Czukay and Schmidt were both pupils of Stockhausen, and Can inherited a grounding in his musical theory. Schmidt was trained as a classical pianist, while Karoli brought the influence of gypsy music through his esoteric studies. Liebezeit had strong jazz leanings. The band&#x27;s sound was originally intended to be based on the sound of ethnic music, so when the band decided to pick up the garage rock sound, original member David Johnson left. This world music trend was later exemplified on albums such as &quot;Ege Bamyasi&quot; (the name meaning &quot;Aegean okra&quot; in Turkish), &quot;Future Days&quot; and &quot;Saw Delight&quot;, and by incorporating new band members with different nationalities. A series of tracks on Can albums, known as &quot;Ethnological Forgery Series&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;E.F.S&quot;, demonstrated the band&#x27;s ability to successfully recreate ethnic-sounding music. They constructed their music largely through collective spontaneous composition, sampling themselves in the studio and editing down the results. Czukay referred to Can&#x27;s live and studio performances as &quot;instant compositions&quot;.

The band&#x27;s early rock influences include the Beatles and the Velvet Underground as well as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Frank Zappa. The band have admitted that the beginning of Can&#x27;s &quot;Father Cannot Yell&quot; was inspired by the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;European Son&quot;. Malcolm Mooney&#x27;s voice has been compared to that of James Brown (an acknowledged hero of the band members) and their early style, rooted in psychedelic music, drew comparisons with Pink Floyd. Czukay&#x27;s extensive editing has occasionally been compared to the late-&#x27;60s music of trumpeter Miles Davis (such as &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;): Can and Davis both would record long groove-intensive improvisations, then edit the best bits together for their albums. Czukay and Teo Macero (Davis&#x27;s producer and editor) both had roots in the &quot;musique concrète&quot; of the 1940s and &#x27;50s. Irmin Schmidt stated in a discussion with Michael Karoli in 1996 concerning the various citations of influences upon their music: &quot;You know, it&#x27;s funny that in spite of all the supposed influences on us that have been written about, the one overriding influence has never been mentioned: Michael von Biel.&quot;

Suzuki was a very different singer from Mooney, with a multilingual (he claimed to sing in &quot;the language of the Stone Age&quot;) and often inscrutable vocal style. With Suzuki, the band made their most critically and commercially successful albums. The rhythm section&#x27;s work on &quot;Tago Mago&quot; has been especially praised: one critic writes that much of the album is based on &quot;long improvisations built around hypnotic rhythm patterns&quot;; another writes that &quot;Halleluhwah&quot; finds them &quot;pounding out a monster trance/funk beat&quot;.

===Improvisation, recording and live shows===
Much of Can&#x27;s music was based on free improvisation and then edited for the studio albums. Karlheinz Freynik, after visiting one of Can&#x27;s sessions described them as &quot;very anarchic&quot;, as if they were &quot;turning away from the others, and diving into their subconscious, and playing their things&quot;, but after a while they moved into the centerpiece of the improvisation, &quot;they gathered and their minds kind of connected to each other.&quot; The band, commenting on their style, said the core of their synergy is a spiritual communication in contrast to intellectual communication—they doesn&#x27;t hear what the other members play, but playing by themselves. If their individual direction worked out, &quot;everything melted together&quot;.

Malcolm Mooney, describing the band&#x27;s daily routine in early 60s, said the band worked every day for about thirteen hours a day with a lunch break. After the recording, they reviewed the recent tapes at home and take notes. Malcolm listened to the tracks, and &quot;planned a change of lyric, or tell Irmin. Because Irmin for me was a tutor in this music.&quot;

When preparing soundtracks, only Irmin Schmidt would view the film and then give the rest of the band a general description of the scenes they would be scoring. This assisted in the improvised soundtrack being successful both inside and outside the film&#x27;s context.
Can&#x27;s live shows often spontaneously melded improvisational snippets with sonical fragments from their albums. The track &quot;Colchester Finale&quot;, appearing on the &quot;Can Live&quot; album, incorporates portions of &quot;Halleluhwah&quot; into a composition lasting over half an hour. Early concerts found Mooney and Suzuki often able to shock audiences. The actor David Niven was asked by Czukay what he had thought of a concert, Niven replied: &quot;It was great, but I didn&#x27;t know it was music.&quot; After the departure of Suzuki, the music grew in intensity without a vocal centre. The band maintained their ability to collectively improvise with or without central themes for hours at a time (their longest performance, in Berlin, lasted over six hours), resulting in a large archive of performances. Can made attempts to find a new vocalist after the departure of Damo Suzuki, although no one quite fit the position. In 1975, folk singer Tim Hardin took the lead vocal spot and played guitar with Can for one song, at two gigs, performing his own &quot;The Lady Came From Baltimore&quot;. Malaysian vocalist Thaiga Raj Raja Ratnam played six dates with the band between January and March 1976. Another temporary vocalist, Englishman Michael Cousins, a.k.a. &quot;Magic Michael&quot;, toured with Can from March (France) to April (West Germany) 1976.

== Legacy and influence ==
In the late 1970s, Can influenced major artists working in the post-punk genre such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Fall, Public Image Ltd, Teardrop Explodes&#x27;s Julian Cope, and Joy Division. In the 1980s, Can were referenced by British new wave acts such as Pete Shelley, Gary Numan, Ultravox, the Jesus and Mary Chain and Primal Scream. The Lumerians and Happy Mondays have cited Can as an influence. Critic Simon Reynolds wrote that &quot;Can&#x27;s pan-global avant-funk anticipated many of the moves made by sampladelic dance genres like trip hop, ethnotechno and ambient jungle.&quot; Brian Eno made a short film in tribute to Can, while John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers appeared at the Echo Awards ceremony, at which Can were awarded the most prestigious music award in Germany. 

Radiohead cited Can as an influence on their albums &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001). Inspired by Can, they constructed their own studio and worked by recording jams and then editing the recordings. Radiohead covered &quot;The Thief&quot; in live performances in the early 2000s. Mark E. Smith of the Fall paid tribute to Suzuki with the track &quot;I Am Damo Suzuki&quot; on the 1985 album &quot;This Nation&#x27;s Saving Grace&quot;. The Jesus and Mary Chain covered &quot;Mushroom&quot; live in the mid-1980s. Mark Hollis of Talk Talk had mentioned Can several times as an influence for their later albums, &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; and &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;. Avant-pop band Stereolab often incorporate a repetitive motorik beat, promoted by Can.

At least five notable bands have named themselves in tribute to Can: the Mooney Suzuki for Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki; the indie rock band Spoon after the hit &quot;Spoon&quot;; the electronic band Egebamyasi, formed by Scottish musician Mr Egg in 1984, after Can&#x27;s album &quot;Ege Bamyasi&quot;; Hunters &amp; Collectors after a song on the &quot;Landed&quot; album; and Moonshake, named for a track on &quot;Future Days&quot;, and formed by ex-Wolfhounds frontman David Callahan. The Scottish writer Alan Warner has written two novels dedicated to several Can members (&quot;Morvern Callar&quot; to Holger Czukay, &quot;The Man Who Walks&quot; to Michael Karoli, &quot;Kitchenly 434&quot; to Irmin Schmidt), as well as publishing &quot;Tago Mago: Permission to Dream&quot;, about their album &quot;Tago Mago&quot;. The &quot;Sacrilege&quot; remix album features remixes of Can tracks by artists who were influenced by Can and krautrock in general, including Brian Eno, The Orb, Sonic Youth, and U.N.K.L.E. Their ethnomusicological tendencies pre-date the craze for world music in the 1980s. While not nearly as influential on electronic music as Kraftwerk, they were important early pioneers of ambient music, along with Tangerine Dream and the aforementioned band. Many groups working in the post-rock genre can look to Can as an influence as part of the larger krautrock scene, as can New Prog bands such as The Mars Volta. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the group a &quot;pioneering space rock band&quot;. Kanye West has sampled &quot;Sing Swan Song&quot; on his song &quot;Drunk &amp; Hot Girls&quot; from his 2007 album &quot;Graduation&quot;. The UK band Loop was deeply influenced by Can for their repetitive polyrhythmic style, covering Can&#x27;s &quot;Mother Sky&quot; on their &quot;Black Sun&quot; EP. The Yugoslav progressive/psychedelic rock band Igra Staklenih Perli, heavily influenced by Can, on their self-titled debut album released the song &quot;Pečurka&quot; (&quot;Mushroom&quot;) as a tribute to Can.

In 21st century, the band has been name-checked as a formative influence in LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s debut single &quot;Losing My Edge&quot;. Oasis&#x27; 2008 single &quot;The Shock of the Lightning&quot; was inspired by Can and Neu!. The Japanese psych/krautrock band Minami Deutsch is heavily influenced by Can, and band member Kyotaro Mitula performed with Damo Suzuki at the Roadburn Festival.

<text>Tuttlingen is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the south of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Rottweil, Zollernalbkreis, Sigmaringen, Constance and Schwarzwald-Baar.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Tuttlingen&quot;, which was created in 1806. After several minor changes it was merged with the Oberamt Spaichingen and converted into the district in 1938. In 1973, it was enlarged by some municipalities from the dissolved districts Donaueschingen and Stockach.

== Mining ==
From an old 3.5 km mine in a Doggererzflöz in Weilheim is wood in the Tuttlinger Fruchtkasten . Steel was produced in Tuttlingen by the Schwäbische Hüttenwerke in Ludwigshal. The furnace in Harras was closed in 1832. By building railways new calculations make the ironore of the area unprofitable. After the Franco-Prussian War mining was stopped.

==Geography==
The landscape of the district are the hills of the Swabian Alb, with the Danube as the main river.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show a deer antler in the top part, the symbol of the state of Württemberg. The area of the district became part of Württemberg in the 14th century. The half wheel in the bottom is the symbol of the Lords of Hohenberg, representing an Austrian possession in the district.

<text>Walking into Clarksdale is the only studio album by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, both formerly of English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released by Atlantic Records on 20 April 1998. The album was recorded and mixed by Steve Albini at Abbey Road Studios.

The album debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart at No. 8, while reaching No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart. The single &quot;Most High&quot; was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1999, and reached No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and No. 26 in the UK.

Plant re-recorded the song &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot; with Alison Krauss for their 2007 collaboration album &quot;Raising Sand&quot;. This re-recording won the Record of the Year award at the 2009 Grammy Awards. &quot;House of Love&quot; was later re-recorded with different lyrics by Robert Plant and the Sensational Space Shifters for their 2014 studio album &quot;Lullaby and the Ceaseless Roar&quot;.

The title of the album refers to Clarksdale, Mississippi, a town in the Mississippi Delta considered to be the birthplace of blues music.

== Background and recording ==
Following their successful &quot;No Quarter&quot; tour and subsequent live album release, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant began writing &quot;Walking into Clarksdale.&quot; For the new record, Page and Plant pursued a more stripped-down sound, eschewing the heavy orchestration of their live performances in favor of a more traditional four-piece band. The initial demos for the album were written by Page on a Harmony H1260 Sovereign guitar, first used during the recording of &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;.

The band met at RAK Studios in August 1997 where they recorded &quot;Burning Up&quot; and &quot;Shining in the Light&quot;. Shortly after, the band left RAK for Abbey Road&#x27;s EMI Number Two Studio, where they recorded the rest of the album over the course of 35 days in August and September. Page characterized the band&#x27;s approach as &quot;minimalistic&quot;, stating that the band wanted to avoid &quot;embellishments for the sake of it&quot; and that &quot;every note was played in its place to mean something.&quot;

The album was recorded and mixed by Steve Albini, known for producing Nirvana&#x27;s final album &quot;In Utero&quot;. Plant reported he had long admired Albini&#x27;s music and recording techniques. Each song was recorded in a single take, with the full band live in the studio, with the exception of guitar layering on the title track and string and keyboard overdubs on &quot;Upon a Golden Horse&quot; and &quot;Most High&quot;.

== Release==
&quot;Walking Into Clarksdale&quot; was released internationally on 20 April 1998 and in North America on 21 April to widespread critical acclaim. The album received significant promotion from Atlantic Records, which mounted an extensive marketing campaign. This included advertising on major U.S. cable channels, placements in prominent national print outlets such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and numerous interviews on major talk shows. A &quot;substantial radio buy&quot; in the top 20 radio markets further bolstered its visibility.

In a novel move, Atlantic Records partnered with Ticketmaster to promote the album directly to fans purchasing tickets for the 1998 tour—a first for the label. These efforts contributed to strong sales, earning the album gold certification in the United States.

The album’s lead single, &quot;Most High,&quot; was released on 30 March 1998. It debuted at No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart and quickly climbed to No. 1. A second single, &quot;Shining in the Light,&quot; followed on 30 May 1998.

The album&#x27;s cover, designed by Martin Callomon, features photography by Anton Corbijn, renowned for his work with U2 and Depeche Mode. &quot;Walking Into Clarksdale&quot; was later named 1998 Album of the Year by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

== Tour ==
To promote &quot;Walking into Clarksdale&quot;, Page and Plant kicked off 1998&#x27;s &quot;Walking into Everywhere&quot; Tour. The tour, consisting of three tours of Eastern Europe, North America, and Western Europe, consisted of 97 tour dates and featured a mix of both new material and Led Zeppelin classics. The band&#x27;s concert in Bucharest, Romania was professionally filmed for a cancelled home video release, and parts of the concert were broadcast live on the MTV special “Live from the 10 Spot” to promote the album.

Three additional tour legs in Japan, Australia, and South America were planned for 1999. However, following a final appearance in Paris on 10 December 1998 at the Amnesty International “The Struggle Continues…” concert, Robert Plant dissolved the partnership and the planned 1999 tour was cancelled.

<doc id="251579" wikidata="Q472182" url="?curid=251579" title="Charles Dow">
<text>Charles Henry Dow (; November 6, 1851 – December 4, 1902) was an American journalist who co-founded Dow Jones &amp; Company with Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser.

Dow also co-founded &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, which has become one of the most respected financial publications in the world. He also invented the Dow Jones Industrial Average as part of his research into market movements. He developed a series of principles for understanding and analyzing market behavior which later became known as Dow theory, the groundwork for technical analysis.

==Working on Wall Street==
Simultaneously to his work in publishing, in 1885 Dow also served as a Partner in the NYSE brokerage house of Goodbody, Glynn and Dow where he remained until its dissolution six years later. His Partner, Robert Goodbody, was an Irish citizen and thus at that time ineligible to own a seat. By 1891, both men would part ways. Robert would start his own firm entitled Robert Goodbody &amp; Co, which would become the fifth largest brokerage firm in the United States, before being bought by Merrill Lynch in 1971.

==Dow Jones Averages==
The stock price average was created on July 3, 1884, by Charles Dow as part of the &quot;Customer&#x27;s Afternoon Letter&quot;. At its inception, it consisted of 11 companies—9 railroads and 2 non-rail companies, Pacific Mail Steamship and Western Union Telegraph.
On September 23, 1889, the “20 Active Stock” index was introduced. It included 18 railroad and 2 non-rail stocks.

Nowadays, the DJIA remains one of the oldest and popular stock indices in the world.

On October 25, 1896, Dow replaced the 2 non-rail stocks in the “20 Active Stock” index with 2 rail stocks and the index became the Dow Jones Railroad Average (DJRA). The DJRA remained a rail average of 20 stocks until January 2, 1970, when the average was changed to the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA)—9 railroad stocks were replaced by 9 airline and trucking stocks.

==Theory of stock price movements==

In 1899, Dow started an editorial column in his newspaper in order to educate the general reader until his death in 1902. The column dealt mainly with stock market activities and economic matters. It was in this column that he often put forward his ideas of stock price movements, which were the foundation of what was later called the Dow Theory.
Unfortunately, his complete editorial writings are not available to the general reader. However, most of his writings can be found in the following books:
# Samuel Armstrong Nelson, The ABC of stock speculation &#x27;The A B C of Stock Speculation&#x27;, 1902
# George W. Bishop, &quot;Charles H. Dow and The Dow Theory&quot;, 1960
# Laura Sether ed., &quot;Dow Theory Unplugged: Charles Dow&#x27;s Original Editorials &amp; Their Relevance Today&quot;, 2009
The basic idea of Dow is that the stock price is affected by various factors interacting at the same time, leading to distinct patterns of stock price movement. The first step is to establish from past data the relationship between these patterns and each important factor. Thereafter, by identifying the main factors which are presently working, we can predict the probable future movement of stock price. One of the most important contributions to stock market thought was his theory of the three movements in the market.

==Personal==
At age 30, having moved to New York City the prior year to accept a job offer, Dow married his wife Lucy, who had a daughter from a previous marriage. The couple had no children of their own.

<doc id="251582" wikidata="Q9324400" url="?curid=251582" title="Elephant shrew">
<text>Elephant shrews, also called jumping shrews or sengis, are small insectivorous mammals native to Africa, belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea. Their traditional common English name &quot;elephant shrew&quot; comes from a perceived resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and their superficial similarity with shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. However, phylogenetic analysis has revealed that elephant shrews are not properly classified with true shrews, but are in fact more closely related to elephants than to shrews. In 1997, the biologist Jonathan Kingdon proposed that they instead be called &quot;sengis&quot; (singular &quot;sengi&quot;), a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa, and in 1998, they were classified into the new clade Afrotheria.


They are widely distributed across the southern part of Africa, and although common nowhere, can be found in almost any type of habitat, from the Namib Desert to boulder-strewn outcrops in South Africa to thick forest. One species, the North African elephant shrew, remains in the semi-arid, mountainous country in the far northwest of Africa. The Somali elephant shrew went unobserved from 1968 to 2020 but was rediscovered by a group of scientists in Djibouti.

==Description==

Elephant shrews are small, quadrupedal, insectivorous mammals. They have scaly tails, long snouts, and bear a superficial resemblance to shrews or rodents. They have long legs relative to their size, which are used to move from one place to another like rabbits. 
Elephant shrews use their flexible proboscises to search for food, with the length of the snout varying between species. 

They are one of the fastest small mammals, having been recorded to reach speeds of . They vary in size from about , from . One species of giant sengi, the grey-faced sengi, weighs about 700 g. Compared to other mammalian insectivores, sengis have relatively large brains. Their lifespans are about two and a half to four years in the wild. They have large canine teeth, and also high-crowned cheek teeth similar to those of ungulates. Their dental formula is G

==Behavior and ecology==
Although mostly diurnal and very active, they are difficult to trap and very seldom seen; elephant shrews are wary, well camouflaged, and adept at dashing away from threats. Several species make a series of cleared pathways through the undergrowth and spend their day patrolling them for insect life. If the animal is disturbed, the pathway provides an obstacle-free escape route.

Elephant shrews are solitary animals, despite many species living in monogamous pairs. They share and defend their home territory, which is marked using their scent glands. Scent markings are also used for mate attraction.

Short-eared elephant shrews inhabit the dry steppes and stone deserts of southwestern Africa. They can even be found in the Namib Desert, one of the driest regions of the earth. Females drive away other females, while males try to ward off other males. Although they live in pairs, the partners do not care much for each other and their sole purpose of even associating with the opposite sex is for reproduction. Social behaviors are not very common and they even have separate nests. The one or two young are well developed at birth; they are able to run within a few hours.

Female elephant shrews undergo a menstrual cycle similar to that of human females, making it one of the few nonprimate mammals to do so. Elephant shrews were used in the 1940s to study the human menstruation cycle. The elephant shrew mating period lasts for several days. After mating, the pair will return to their solitary habits. After a gestation period varying from 45 to 60 days, the female will bear litters of one to three young several times a year. The young are born relatively well developed, but remain in the nest for several days before venturing outside.

After five days, the young&#x27;s milk diet is supplemented with mashed insects, which are collected and transported in the cheek pouches of the female. The young then slowly start to explore their environment and hunt for insects. After about 15 days, the young will begin the migratory phase of their lives, which lessens their dependency on their mother. The young will then establish their own home ranges (about ) and will become sexually active within 41–46 days.

The thermal characteristics of elephant shrews with similar body size, habitat and distribution are very close in most of the classifications. They can maintain homeothermy in different ambient temperatures where most of the species regulate their body temperature at 35 °C and neither become hyperthermic but they balance the heat offload by increasing the EWL (evaporative water loss).

===Feeding habits===
Elephant shrews mainly eat insects, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and earthworms. While awake, as much as 80% of their time may be spent foraging. An elephant shrew uses its nose to find prey and uses its tongue to flick small food into its mouth, much like an anteater. Eating large prey can pose a challenge; an elephant shrew struggling with an earthworm must first pin its prey to the ground with a forefoot. Then, turning its head to one side, it chews pieces off with its cheek teeth, much like a dog chewing a bone. This is a sloppy process, and many small pieces of worm drop to the ground; these are simply flicked up with the tongue. Some elephant shrews also feed on small amounts of plant matter, especially new leaves, seeds, and small fruits.

==Evolution==
A number of fossil species are known, all from Africa. They were separate from the similar-appearing order Leptictida. A considerable diversification of macroscelids occurred in the Paleogene period. The earliest definitive member was &quot;Chambia&quot; from the early-middle Eocene of Tunisia. Some early macroscelids, such as &quot;Myohyrax&quot;, were so similar to hyraxes that they were initially included with that group, while others, such as &quot;Mylomygale&quot;, were relatively rodent-like. These unusual forms all died out by the Pleistocene. Although macroscelids were classified in the past with many groups, often on the basis of superficial characteristics, considerable morphological and molecular evidence places them within Afrotheria, at the base of Afroinsectivora.

In terms of timing, the divergence between macroscelids and afrosoricidans is thought to have occurred roughly 57.5 million years (Ma) ago, in the late Paleocene, while the diversification of extant macroscelids apparently began when the &quot;Rhynchocyon&quot; lineage split off about 33 Ma ago, in the early Oligocene. &quot;Elephantulus&quot; is considered to have separated from Macroscelidini later in the Oligocene, about 28.5 Ma ago.

<text>In mathematics, a quartic equation is one which can be expressed as a &quot;quartic function&quot; equaling zero. The general form of a quartic equation is

:formula_1
where &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0.

The quartic is the highest order polynomial equation that can be solved by radicals in the general case (i.e., one in which the coefficients can take any value).

==History==
Lodovico Ferrari is attributed with the discovery of the solution to the quartic in 1540, but since this solution, like all algebraic solutions of the quartic, requires the solution of a cubic to be found, it could not be published immediately. The solution of the quartic was published together with that of the cubic by Ferrari&#x27;s mentor Gerolamo Cardano in the book &quot;Ars Magna&quot; (1545).

The proof that this was the highest order general polynomial for which such solutions could be found was first given in the Abel–Ruffini theorem in 1824, proving that all attempts at solving the higher order polynomials would be futile. The notes left by Évariste Galois before his death in a duel in 1832 later led to an elegant complete theory of the roots of polynomials, of which this theorem was one result.

== Solving a quartic equation, special cases ==

Consider a quartic equation expressed in the form formula_2:

There exists a general formula for finding the roots to quartic equations, provided the coefficient of the leading term is non-zero. However, since the general method is quite complex and susceptible to errors in execution, it is better to apply one of the special cases listed below if possible.

=== Degenerate case ===
If the constant term &quot;a&quot;4 = 0, then one of the roots is &quot;x&quot; = 0, and the other roots can be found by dividing by &quot;x&quot;, and solving the resulting cubic equation,
:formula_3

=== Evident roots: 1 and −1 and − ===

Call our quartic polynomial . Since 1 raised to any power is 1,
: formula_4
Thus if formula_5 and so = 1 is a root of . It can similarly be shown that if formula_6 = −1 is a root.

In either case the full quartic can then be divided by the factor or respectively yielding a new cubic polynomial, which can be solved to find the quartic&#x27;s other roots.

If formula_7 formula_8 and formula_9 then formula_10 is a root of the equation. The full quartic can then be factorized this way:
: formula_11

Alternatively, if formula_7 formula_13 and formula_14 then and become two known roots. divided by is a quadratic polynomial.

=== Biquadratic equations ===
A quartic equation where &quot;a&quot;3 and &quot;a&quot;1 are equal to 0 takes the form
:formula_15

and thus is a biquadratic equation, which is easy to solve: let formula_16, so our equation becomes

:formula_17

which is a simple quadratic equation, whose solutions are easily found using the quadratic formula:

:formula_18

When we&#x27;ve solved it (i.e. found these two &quot;z&quot; values), we can extract &quot;x&quot; from them

:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22

If either of the &quot;z&quot; solutions were negative or complex numbers, then some of the &quot;x&quot; solutions are complex numbers.

=== Quasi-symmetric equations ===

: formula_23

Steps:

# Divide by &quot;x&quot; 2.
# Use variable change &quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;m&quot;/&quot;x&quot;.
# So, &quot;z&quot; 2 = &quot;x&quot; 2 + (&quot;m&quot;/&quot;x&quot;) 2 + 2&quot;m&quot;.

This leads to:

:formula_24, 
:formula_25,
:formula_26 (a quadratic in &quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;m&quot;/&quot;x&quot;)

=== Multiple roots ===

If the quartic has a double root, it can be found by taking the polynomial greatest common divisor with its derivative. Then they can be divided out and the resulting quadratic equation solved.

In general, there exist only four possible cases of quartic equations with multiple roots, which are listed below:

# Multiplicity-4 (M4): when the general quartic equation can be expressed as formula_27, for some real number formula_28. This case can always be reduced to a biquadratic equation.
# Multiplicity-3 (M3): when the general quartic equation can be expressed as formula_29, where formula_28 and formula_31 are two different real numbers. This is the only case that can never be reduced to a biquadratic equation.
# Double Multiplicity-2 (DM2): when the general quartic equation can be expressed as formula_32, where formula_28 and formula_31 are two different real numbers or a pair of non-real complex conjugate numbers. This case can also always be reduced to a biquadratic equation.
# Single Multiplicity-2 (SM2): when the general quartic equation can be expressed as formula_35, where formula_28, formula_31, and formula_38 are three different real numbers or formula_28 is a real number and formula_31 and formula_38 are a pair of non-real complex conjugate numbers. This case is divided into two subcases, those that can be reduced to a biquadratic equation and those that can&#x27;t.

So, if the three non-monic coefficients of the depressed quartic equation, formula_42, in terms of the five coefficients of the general quartic equation are given as follows: formula_43, formula_44 and formula_45, then the criteria to identify a priori each case of quartic equations with multiple roots and their respective solutions are shown below.

* M4. The general quartic equation corresponds to this case whenever formula_46, so the four roots of this equation are given as follows: formula_47.
* M3. The general quartic equation corresponds to this case whenever formula_48 and formula_49, so the four roots of this equation are given as follows: formula_50  and formula_51 , whether formula_52; otherwise, formula_53  and formula_54.
* DM2. The general quartic equation corresponds to this case whenever formula_55, so the four roots of this equation are given as follows: formula_56 and formula_57.
* Biquadratic SM2. The general quartic equation corresponds to this subcase of the SM2 equations whenever formula_58, so the four roots of this equation are given as follows: formula_59, formula_60 and formula_61.
* Non-Biquadratic SM2. The general quartic equation corresponds to this subcase of the SM2 equations whenever formula_62, so the four roots of this equation are given by the following formula: formula_63, where formula_64, formula_65 and formula_66.

== The general case ==

To begin, the quartic must first be converted to a &quot;depressed quartic&quot;.

=== Converting to a depressed quartic ===
Let

be the general quartic equation which it is desired to solve. Divide both sides by ,
:formula_67

The first step, if is not already zero, should be to eliminate the 3 term. To do this, change variables from to , such that
:formula_68
Then
:formula_69
Expanding the powers of the binomials produces
:formula_70
Collecting the same powers of &quot;u&quot; yields
:formula_71

Now rename the coefficients of . Let
:formula_72
The resulting equation is

which is a depressed quartic equation.

If formula_73 then we have the special case of a biquadratic equation, which is easily solved, as explained above. Note that the general solution, given below, will &quot;not&quot; work for the special case formula_74 The equation must be solved as a biquadratic.

In either case, once the depressed quartic is solved for , substituting those values into
:formula_75
produces the values for that solve the original quartic.

=== Solving a depressed quartic when ≠ 0 ===
After converting to a depressed quartic equation
:formula_76
and excluding the special case = 0, which is solved as a biquadratic, we assume from here on that 

We will separate the terms left and right as
:formula_77
and add in terms to both sides which make them both into perfect squares.

Let be any solution of this cubic equation:
:formula_78 
Then (since ≠ 0)
:formula_79
so we may divide by it, giving
:formula_80

Then
:formula_81

Subtracting, we get the difference of two squares which is the product of the sum and difference of their roots
:formula_82
which can be solved by applying the quadratic formula to each of the two factors. So the possible values of are:
:formula_83 
:formula_84 
:formula_85 or
:formula_86 

Using another from among the three roots of the cubic simply causes these same four values of to appear in a different order. The solutions of the cubic are:
:formula_87
:formula_88
using any one of the three possible cube roots. A wise strategy is to choose the sign of the square-root that makes the absolute value of as large as possible.
:formula_89
:formula_90

=== Ferrari&#x27;s solution ===
Otherwise, the depressed quartic can be solved by means of a method discovered by Lodovico Ferrari. Once the depressed quartic has been obtained, the next step is to add the valid identity
:formula_91
to equation (), yielding

The effect has been to fold up the &quot;u&quot;4 term into a perfect square: (&quot;u&quot;2 + a)2. The second term, &quot;au&quot;2 did not disappear, but its sign has changed and it has been moved to the right side.

The next step is to insert a variable &quot;y&quot; into the perfect square on the left side of equation (), and a corresponding 2&quot;y&quot; into the coefficient of &quot;u&quot;2 in the right side. To accomplish these insertions, the following valid formulas will be added to equation (),
:formula_92
and
:formula_93
These two formulas, added together, produce
:formula_94
which added to equation () produces
:formula_95
This is equivalent to
The objective now is to choose a value for &quot;y&quot; such that the right side of equation () becomes a perfect square. This can be done by letting the discriminant of the quadratic function become zero. To explain this, first expand a perfect square so that it equals a quadratic function:
:formula_96
The quadratic function on the right side has three coefficients. It can be verified that squaring the second coefficient and then subtracting four times the product of the first and third coefficients yields zero:
:formula_97

Therefore to make the right side of equation () into a perfect square, the following equation must be solved:
:formula_98
Multiply the binomial with the polynomial,
:formula_99
Divide both sides by −4, and move the −&quot;b&quot;2/4 to the right,
:formula_100
Divide both sides by 2,
This is a cubic equation in &quot;y&quot;. Solve for &quot;y&quot; using any method for solving such equations (e.g. conversion to a reduced cubic and application of Cardano&#x27;s formula). Any of the three possible roots will do.

==== Folding the second perfect square ====
With the value for &quot;y&quot; so selected, it is now known that the right side of equation () is a perfect square of the form
:formula_101
::(This is correct for both signs of square root, as long as the same sign is taken for both square roots. A ± is redundant, as it would be absorbed by another ± a few equations further down this page.)
so that it can be folded:
:formula_102
::Note: If &quot;b&quot; ≠ 0 then &quot;a&quot; + 2&quot;y&quot; ≠ 0. If &quot;b&quot; = 0 then this would be a biquadratic equation, which we solved earlier.
Therefore equation () becomes
 \right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;|}}
Equation () has a pair of folded perfect squares, one on each side of the equation. The two perfect squares balance each other.

If two squares are equal, then the sides of the two squares are also equal, as shown by:
 \right). &lt;/math&gt;|}}
Collecting like powers of &quot;u&quot; produces
 \right) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;|}}
::Note: The subscript &quot;s&quot; of formula_103 and formula_104 is to note that they are dependent.
Equation () is a quadratic equation for &quot;u&quot;. Its solution is
:formula_105
Simplifying, one gets
:formula_106
This is the solution of the depressed quartic, therefore the solutions of the original quartic equation are
 \right)} \over 2}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}
::Remember: The two formula_103 come from the same place in equation (), and should both have the same sign, while the sign of formula_108 is independent.

==== Summary of Ferrari&#x27;s method ====
Given the quartic equation

:formula_109

its solution can be found by means of the following calculations:

:formula_110

:formula_111

:formula_112

If formula_113 then

::formula_114

Otherwise, continue with

:formula_115

:formula_116

:formula_117

(either sign of the square root will do)

:formula_118

(there are 3 complex roots, any one of them will do)

:formula_119

:formula_120

:formula_121

::The two ±s must have the same sign, the ±&quot;t&quot; is independent. To get all roots, compute &quot;x&quot; for ±&quot;s&quot;,±&quot;t&quot; = +,+ and for +,−; and for −,+ and for −,−. This formula handles repeated roots without problem.

Ferrari was the first to discover one of these labyrinthine solutions. The equation which he solved was

:formula_122

which was already in depressed form. It has a pair of solutions which can be found with the set of formulas shown above.

=== Ferrari&#x27;s solution in the special case of real coefficients ===

If the coefficients of the quartic equation are real then the nested depressed cubic equation () also has real coefficients, thus it has at least one real root.

Furthermore the cubic function
:formula_123
where P and Q are given by () has the properties that
:formula_124 and
formula_125
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are given by ().

This means that () has a real root greater than formula_126,
and therefore that () has a real root greater than formula_127.

Using this root the term formula_128 in () is always real,
which ensures that the two quadratic equations () have real coefficients.

=== Obtaining alternative solutions the hard way ===

It could happen that one only obtained one solution through the formulae above, because not all four sign patterns are tried for four solutions, and the solution obtained is complex. It may also be the case that one is only looking for a real solution. Let &quot;x&quot;1 denote the complex solution. If all the original coefficients &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; are real—which should be the case when one desires only real solutions – then there is another complex solution &quot;x&quot;2 which is the complex conjugate of &quot;x&quot;1. If the other two roots are denoted as &quot;x&quot;3 and &quot;x&quot;4 then the quartic equation can be expressed as
:formula_129
but this quartic equation is equivalent to the product of two quadratic equations:

and

Since
:formula_130
then
:formula_131

Let
:formula_132
:formula_133
so that equation () becomes

Also let there be (unknown) variables &quot;w&quot; and &quot;v&quot; such that equation () becomes

Multiplying equations () and () produces

Comparing equation () to the original quartic equation, it can be seen that
:formula_134
:formula_135
:formula_136
and
:formula_137
Therefore
:formula_138
:formula_139
Equation () can be solved for &quot;x&quot; yielding
:formula_140
:formula_141
One of these two solutions should be the desired real solution.

== Alternative methods ==

=== Quick and memorable solution from first principles ===

Most textbook solutions of the quartic equation require a substitution that is hard to memorize. Here is an approach that makes it easy to understand. The job is done if we can factor the quartic equation into a product of two quadratics. Let

:formula_142

By equating coefficients, this results in the following set of simultaneous equations: 
:formula_143

This is harder to solve than it looks, but if we start again with a depressed quartic where formula_144, which can be obtained by substituting formula_145 for formula_146, then formula_147, and: 
:formula_148

It&#x27;s now easy to eliminate both formula_149 and formula_150 by doing the following: 
:formula_151

If we set formula_152, then this equation turns into the cubic equation: 
:formula_153
which is solved elsewhere. Once you have formula_154, then: 
:formula_155

The symmetries in this solution are easy to see. There are three roots of the cubic, corresponding to the three ways that a quartic can be factored into two quadratics, and choosing positive or negative values of formula_154 for the square root of formula_157 merely exchanges the two quadratics with one another.

=== Galois theory and factorization ===

The symmetric group &quot;S&quot;4 on four elements has the Klein four-group as a normal subgroup. This suggests using a resolvent whose roots may be variously described as a discrete Fourier transform or a Hadamard matrix transform of the roots.
Suppose &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot; from 0 to 3 are roots of 
:formula_158 
If we now set
:formula_159
then since the transformation is an involution, we may express the roots in terms of the four si in exactly the same way. Since we know the value &quot;s&quot;0 = −&quot;b&quot;/2, we really only need the values for s1, s2 and s3. These we may find by expanding the polynomial 
:formula_160
which if we make the simplifying assumption that &quot;b&quot; = 0, is equal to
:formula_161
This polynomial is of degree six, but only of degree three in z2, and so the corresponding equation is solvable. By trial we can determine which three roots are the correct ones, and hence find the solutions of the quartic.

We can remove any requirement for trial by using a root of the same resolvent polynomial for factoring; if w is any root of (3), and if

: formula_162
: formula_163

then

:formula_164

We therefore can solve the quartic by solving for w and then solving for the roots of the two factors using the quadratic formula.

=== Approximate methods ===
The methods described above are, in principle, exact root-finding methods. It is also possible to use successive approximation methods which iteratively converge towards the roots, such as the Durand–Kerner method. Iterative methods are the only ones available for quintic and higher-order equations, beyond trivial or special cases.

<text>Georges Jean Raymond Pompidou ( ; ; 5 July 19112 April 1974) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1969 to his death in 1974. He previously served as Prime Minister of France under President Charles de Gaulle from 1962 to 1968, a longevity record under the Fifth Republic.

In the context of the strong growth of the last years of the &quot;Trente Glorieuses&quot;, Pompidou continued De Gaulle&#x27;s policy of modernisation, which was symbolised by the presidential use of the Concorde, the creation of large industrial groups and the launch of the high-speed train project (TGV). The government invested heavily in the automobile, agribusiness, steel, telecommunications, nuclear and aerospace sectors and also created the minimum wage (SMIC) and the Ministry of the Environment.

His foreign policy was pragmatic but in line with the Gaullist principle of French autonomy within the Western Bloc. It was marked by a warming of relations with Richard Nixon&#x27;s United States, close relations with Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s Soviet Union, the launch of the &#x27;snake in the tunnel&#x27; and the relaunching of European construction by facilitating the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry to the EEC in contrast to de Gaulle&#x27;s opposition. Pompidou died in office in 1974 of Waldenström&#x27;s disease, a rare form of blood cancer.

An admirer of contemporary art, Pompidou&#x27;s name remains known worldwide for the Centre Pompidou, which he initiated and was inaugurated in 1977; it subsequently spread the name with its branches in Metz (France), Málaga (Spain), Brussels (Belgium) and Shanghai (China). A Georges Pompidou Museum is also dedicated to him in his hometown.

==Early life==
The family of Georges Pompidou was of very modest origins. He was the grandson of farmers of modest means in Cantal on both his father&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s side. His case is thus often cited as a typical example of social mobility in the Third Republic because of public schooling.

Georges Jean Raymond Pompidou was born on 5 July 1911 in the commune of Montboudif, in the department of Cantal, in south-central France. After his &quot;hypokhâgne&quot; at Lycée Pierre-de-Fermat and his &quot;khâgne&quot; at Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he befriended the future Senegalese poet and Léopold Sédar Senghor, Pompidou attended the École Normale Supérieure from which he graduated with a degree of &quot;agrégation&quot; in literature.

He first taught literature at the lycée Henri IV in Paris until he was hired in 1953 by Guy de Rothschild to work at Rothschild. In 1956, he was appointed the bank&#x27;s general manager, a position that he held until 1962. Later, he was hired by Charles de Gaulle to manage the Anne de Gaulle Foundation for Down syndrome (de Gaulle&#x27;s youngest daughter, Anne, had Down syndrome).

==Prime minister==
Jacques Chirac served as an aide to Prime Minister Pompidou and recalled:

He served as prime minister of France under de Gaulle after Michel Debré resigned, from 14 April 1962 to 10 July 1968, and to this day is the longest serving French prime minister under the Fifth Republic. His nomination was controversial because he was not a member of the National Assembly. In October 1962, he was defeated in a vote of no-confidence, but de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly. This was the last time a French government fell to a confidence vote until the collapse of Michel Barnier&#x27;s government in 2024. The Gaullists won the legislative election and Pompidou was reappointed as prime minister. 

In 1964, he was faced with a miners&#x27; strike. He led the 1967 legislative campaign of the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic to a narrow victory. Pompidou was widely regarded as being responsible for the peaceful resolution of the student uprising of May 1968. His strategy was to break the coalition of students and workers by negotiating with the trade-unions and employers (Grenelle conference).

During the events of May 1968, disagreements arose between Pompidou and de Gaulle. Pompidou did not understand why the President did not inform him of his departure to Baden-Baden on 29 May. Their relationship, until then very good, would be strained from then on. Pompidou led and won the 1968 legislative campaign, overseeing a tremendous victory of the Gaullist Party. He then resigned. Nevertheless, in part due to his actions during the May 1968 crisis, he appeared as the natural successor to de Gaulle. Pompidou announced his candidature for the Presidency in January 1969.

In social policy, Pompidou&#x27;s tenure as prime minister witnessed the establishment of the National Employment Fund in 1963 to counter the negative effects on employment caused by industrial restructuring.

==Presidency==
After the failure of the 1969 constitutional referendum, de Gaulle resigned and Pompidou was elected president of France. In the general election of 15 June 1969, he defeated the centrist president of the Senate and acting president Alain Poher by a wide margin (58% to 42%). Though a Gaullist, Pompidou was more pragmatic than de Gaulle, notably facilitating the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Community on 1 January 1973. He embarked on an industrialisation plan and initiated the Arianespace project, as well as the TGV project, and furthered the French civilian nuclear programme. He was sceptical about the &quot;New Society&quot; programme of his prime minister, Jacques Chaban-Delmas. In 1972, he replaced Chaban-Delmas with Pierre Messmer, a more conservative Gaullist. While the left-wing opposition organised itself and proposed a &quot;Common Programme&quot; before the 1973 legislative election, Pompidou widened his presidential majority by including Centrist pro-European parties. In addition, he paid special attention to regional and local needs in order to strengthen his political party, the UDR (Union des Democrates pour la Ve République), which he made a central and lasting force in the Gaullist movement.

===Foreign affairs===
The United States was eager to restore positive relations with France after de Gaulle&#x27;s departure from office. New US President Richard Nixon and his top adviser Henry Kissinger admired Pompidou; the politicians were in agreement on most major policy issues. The United States offered to help the French nuclear programme. Economic difficulties, however, arose following the Nixon Shock and the 1973–1975 recession, particularly over the role of the American dollar as the medium for world trade.

Pompidou sought to maintain good relations with the newly independent former French colonies in Africa, relying on such powerful figures as Jacques Foccart and René Journiac who maintained informal networks with African strongmen. In 1971, he visited Mauritania, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, and Gabon. He brought a message of cooperation and financial assistance, but without the traditional paternalism. More broadly, he made an effort to foster closer relations with North African and Middle Eastern countries in order to develop a hinterland including all nations bordering the Mediterranean.

===Modernising Paris===
Pompidou&#x27;s time in office was marked by constant efforts to modernise France&#x27;s capital city. He spearheaded construction of a modern art museum, the Centre Beaubourg (renamed Centre Pompidou after his death), on the edge of the Marais area of Paris. Other attempts at modernisation included tearing down the open-air markets at Les Halles and replacing them with the shopping mall of the same name, building the Montparnasse Tower, and constructing an expressway on the right bank of the Seine.

==Death in office==
While still in office, Pompidou died on 2 April 1974 at his apartment, from Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Although his illness had not been disclosed and the government officially denied any health problems, there were reports of ill health and speculation of possible cancer during his last year in office. However, even on the day of his death, Pompidou had a visit scheduled from Rwandan President Grégoire Kayibanda.

His body was buried on 4 April, in the churchyard of Orvilliers, where he had bought an old baker&#x27;s house which he turned into a weekend home. The official memorial service for him was held at Notre-Dame de Paris with 3,000 dignitaries in attendance, including foreign heads of state. April 6 was declared a national day of mourning and entertainment and cultural events were canceled, theatres and schools closed.

A controversy arose surrounding the secrecy kept over Pompidou&#x27;s illness, and the political class agreed that future presidents would have to provide reports on the state of their health; however, President François Mitterrand, who had pledged during his 1981 campaign to publish regular health bulletins, would also conceal the severity of his cancer during his presidency.

== Personal life ==
Pompidou was married to Claude Cahour, who would outlive him by more than thirty years. The couple adopted a son, Alain Pompidou, who went on to serve as president of the European Patent Office.

<text>The Waikato () is a region of the upper North Island of New Zealand. It covers the Waikato District, Waipa District, Matamata-Piako District, South Waikato District and Hamilton City, as well as Hauraki, Coromandel Peninsula, the northern King Country, much of the Taupō District, and parts of the Rotorua Lakes District. It is governed by the Waikato Regional Council.

The Waikato stretches from Coromandel Peninsula in the north, to the north-eastern slopes of Mount Ruapehu in the south, and spans the North Island from the west coast, through the Waikato and Hauraki to Coromandel Peninsula on the east coast. Broadly, the extent of the region is the Waikato River catchment. Other major catchments are those of the Waihou, Piako, Awakino and Mokau rivers. The region is bounded by Auckland on the north, Bay of Plenty on the east, Hawke&#x27;s Bay on the south-east, and Manawatū-Whanganui and Taranaki on the south. Waikato Region is the fourth largest region in the country in area and population: It has a land area of and a population of 

The region encompasses all or part of eleven territorial authorities, the most of any region of New Zealand. It is centred on the Waikato which consists of Waikato District, Matamata-Piako District, Waipa District, South Waikato District and Hamilton City. In descending order of land area the eleven territorial authorities are Taupō District (part), Waikato District, Waitomo District (part), Thames-Coromandel District, Ōtorohanga District, South Waikato District, Matamata-Piako District, Waipa District, Hauraki District, Rotorua Lakes District (part), and Hamilton City.

== Name and etymology ==
The name for the region is taken from the Waikato River; &quot;waikato&quot; is a Māori word traditionally translated as &quot;flowing water&quot; (specifically, &quot;wai&quot; = &quot;water&quot; and &quot;kato&quot; = &quot;the pull of the river current in the sea&quot;).

When Waikato is used in spoken language some people use it in the definite article, &quot;the Waikato&quot;, whereas some people do not use &quot;the&quot;. It is unknown why a difference is made. &quot;The&quot; usually refers to a smaller region than the Waikato local government region. Two definitions that would meet with wide acceptance are those of the Waikato rugby football union and of Hamilton Waikato tourism.

==Geography==

To the west, the region is bounded by the Tasman Sea. The coastal region is largely rough hill country, known locally as the Hakarimata Range, though it is more gently undulating in the north, closer to the mouth of the Waikato River. The coast is punctured by three large natural harbours: Raglan Harbour, Aotea Harbour, and Kawhia Harbour. The area around Raglan is noted for its volcanic black sand beaches and for its fine surfing conditions at Manu Bay and Ruapuke beach.

To the east of the coastal hills lies the broad alluvial plain of the Waikato River. This region has a wet temperate climate, and the land is largely pastoral farmland created by European settlers draining the extensive natural swamps, although it also contains undrained peat swamp such as the peat dome south of Ngatea. It is in the broad undulating Waikato Plains that most of the region&#x27;s population resides, and the land is intensively farmed with both livestock, mainly dairy cattle but with sheep farming on the hillier west margins, and crops such as maize. The area around Cambridge has many thoroughbred stables.

The north of the region around Te Kauwhata produces some of New Zealand&#x27;s best wines. Dozens of small shallow lakes lie in this area, the largest of which is Lake Waikare.

To the east, the land rises towards the forested slopes of the Kaimai and Mamaku Ranges. The upper reaches of the Waikato River are used for hydroelectricity, helped by several large artificial lakes in the region&#x27;s south-east. The lowest and earliest-created such lake is Lake Karapiro, now developed as a world-class rowing centre, where the world championships were held in 2010. The river flows out of the country&#x27;s largest lake, Lake Taupō, which is served by several important fishing rivers such as the Tongariro, on the Central Plateau, draining the eastern side of Mount Ruapehu and its neighbours.

The climate is mild and temperate with moderate rainfall of per annum, with the higher western hills having the most rain. Summers are drier with typical maximum temperatures of 22–28 degrees Celsius and overnight lows of 12–16 degrees. Summer droughts occur one year in ten. Typical winter maxima are 10–16 degrees Celsius, with lows generally ranging from 0–8 degrees. Depressions experience regular morning fog, under anticyclonic conditions, which burns off by late morning to produce many still, clear sunny days. Morning frosts are also common during winter anticyclones. Another distinctive feature is the low average wind speed in the interior basin due to the sheltering influence of the hills and mountains to the west and south-west. The prevailing winter wind is from the south-west. The Waikato has very high sunshine hours by world standards, averaging 2200 hours per year or about 40% higher than in the UK. This results in rapid growth of grass, crops and ornamental plants.

Hamilton Waikato takes in the local government areas of Hamilton City, the southern part of Waikato district, Waipa district, most of Matamata-Piako district and the South Waikato district. Hamilton Waikato tourism takes in additionally the northern part of Waikato district (Tuakau and other centres), the northern King Country (Waitomo and Ōtorohanga districts), and the Te Aroha district.

The parts of Waikato region beyond these limits are usually identified as Thames Valley and/or Hauraki/Coromandel (for the north-eastern part of Waikato region) and Taupō, on the Volcanic or Central Plateau (for the south-eastern part of the region).

==Demographics==
Waikato Region covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Waikato Region had a population of 498,771 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 40,569 people (8.9%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 95,130 people (23.6%) since the 2013 census. There were 246,723 males, 250,380 females and 1,671 people of other genders in 180,006 dwellings. 2.8% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 37.9 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 100,743 people (20.2%) aged under 15 years, 93,111 (18.7%) aged 15 to 29, 218,808 (43.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 86,109 (17.3%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 71.7% European (Pākehā); 25.2% Māori; 5.2% Pasifika; 12.2% Asian; 1.4% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.3% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 95.9%, Māori language by 6.3%, Samoan by 0.6% and other languages by 12.4%. No language could be spoken by 2.2% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.5%. The percentage of people born overseas was 21.7, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 30.6% Christian, 2.2% Hindu, 1.2% Islam, 1.8% Māori religious beliefs, 0.9% Buddhist, 0.5% New Age, 0.1% Jewish, and 2.2% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 53.5%, and 7.4% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 65,295 (16.4%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 212,241 (53.3%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 101,277 (25.4%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $40,300, compared with $41,500 nationally. 40,746 people (10.2%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 200,928 (50.5%) people were employed full-time, 53,667 (13.5%) were part-time, and 12,165 (3.1%) were unemployed.

===Cities and towns===

The largest city in the Waikato Region is Hamilton, with an urban population of . It is home to the University of Waikato and the Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec).

Other major towns in the region are Tokoroa, Te Awamutu, Cambridge and Taupō with respective populations of , , and . (These populations include the urban and peri-urban areas). The region also includes the smaller towns of Huntly, Matamata, Morrinsville, Ngāruawāhia, Ōtorohanga, Paeroa, Putāruru, Raglan, Te Aroha, Te Kauwhata, Te Kūiti, Thames, Tīrau, Tuakau, Tūrangi, Whangamatā and Whitianga.

==Economy==

The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of the Waikato region was estimated at NZ$25.84 billion in the year to March 2019, 8.5% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The subnational GDP per capita was estimated at $54,128 in the same period. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $3.14 billion (13.0%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $5.70 billion (23.5%), service industries contributed $13.35 billion (55.0%), and taxes and duties contributed $2.08 billion (8.6%).

Between 2000 and 2004, Waikato economic growth was lower than the national average. But from 2004 to 2007, real gross regional product for the Waikato Region increased by 5 per cent per year compared with 3.2 per cent for the national average. This faster growth can be attributed to rapidly growing dairy and business services industries, facilitated by proximity to the Auckland city, the main international gateway for New Zealand.

=== Agriculture ===
Given the suitable geography and climate, the Waikato economy is strongly based on agriculture, especially dairy. Dairy farming has been the main agricultural activity since the late nineteenth century. Within the Waikato region, small co-operative dairy companies were widespread during the 20th century. Towards the end of the 20th century, frequent mergers of co-operative dairy companies occurred, which ultimately ended in the formation of New Zealand wide dairy co-operative Fonterra in 2001. In 2007, dairy farming and dairy processing combined contributed $2 billion (13%) to GRP, which had risen to $2.4bn by 2014, but only 13,683 (7.6%) of jobs in 2016.

Dairy farms are mainly family owned (2,608 of 4,020 farms in 2016) with owners employing sharemilkers in many cases (1,412 sharemilkers). The size of the average dairy herd in the Waikato has progressively increased. It was about 320 cows in 2012 and in 2016 was about 351 (total Waikato herd 1.41m cows), milked in either a herringbone or automated rotary cowshed so a large herd can be milked in under two hours. The cows are kept on grassland pasture all year due to the mild climate. In the Waikato the original English grasses used by earlier settlers – browntop, fescue and Yorkshire Fog – have been replaced with higher producing Italian ryegrass and nitrogen-fixing white clover. Farmers use a variety of supplementary feeds in winter or during the infrequent summer droughts. Main feeds are hay, grass silage and chopped corn feed. The later is often fed out on a concrete pad to save transportation and wastage by trampling.

=== Manufacturing ===
The manufacturing sector in Waikato contributed $2,688 million in GDP in the year to March 2018, 11.1% of the regional GDP. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, the sector employed 18,519 people, or 9.9% of the region&#x27;s employed population.

With a large dairy farming industry, the Waikato also has a large dairy processing industry. Fonterra operates dairy processing plants at Te Rapa, Te Awamutu, Hautapu, Morrinsville, Waitoa, Tīrau and Lichfield. Other dairy processing plants include Tatua Dairy Company&#x27;s plant at Tatuanui, and Open Country Dairy&#x27;s plant at Horotiu and Waharoa.

The Waikato region has eight major freezing works: AFFCO at Horotiu, Greenlea at Hamilton and Morrinsville, Silver Fern Farms at Te Aroha and Waitoa, Te Kuiti Meat Processors and Universal Beef Packers at Te Kuiti, and Crusader Meats at Benneydale.

The Kinleith Mill south of Tokoroa processes wood from the surrounding forests into pulp and paper.

==History==

Before the arrival of Europeans, the Waikato contained the third most densely populated part of New Zealand, after Northland/Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. The Waikato &quot;rohe&quot; (area) was inhabited by &quot;iwi&quot; (tribes) such as those of the Tainui confederation, including Waikato and Ngāti Toa. Between about 1750 and 1842 the area was subject to a large number of invasions by other Māori iwi and hapu confederations and large scale population migrations took place by a number of &quot;hapū&quot; and &quot;iwi&quot;. The largest battle ever fought in New Zealand took place near Ohaupo about 1790–1805, between two competing alliances of &quot;hapū&quot;. During the latter stages of this volatile period, known as the Musket Wars (1807–1845), conflict led to a migration south to Taranaki and eventually Kapiti Island.

In 1840 44 Waikato chiefs travelled north to the Manukau Heads and Manukau Harbour to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, officially making the Waikato area part of New Zealand. Three Ngāti Maniapoto chiefs signed, as did three Ngāti Haua chiefs but most signatories were Waikato. Chief Te Whero whero did not sign, &quot;probably due to the lack of dignity compared to the Waitangi event&quot;. Unusually, the copy signed was in English. Between 1840 and 1860 the CMS missionaries of the Anglican church assisted Waikato Māori in revolutionising their economy in the Kihikihi area by the introduction of such crops as peaches, maize and wheat.

Missionaries brought in millers and helped Māori establish eight flour mills. These flourished until 1857, as they provided flour for the growing Auckland market in the 1850s and for a brief while were exporting to Australia. There were mills at Aotea, Kaitotehe, Karakariki, Kihikihi, Kirikiriroa, Kohanga, Kopatauaki, Mahoe, Mangaharakeke, Mangapapa, Mangarewarewa, Mangatawhiri, Matamata pā, Maungakawa, Maungatautari, Mohoaonui, Otawhao, Patetere, Rangataiki, Rangiaowhia, Taupō, Te Kopua, Te Rore, Tireke, Tuakau, Waitetuna, Whaingaroa and Whatawhata.

The route used to travel to and from Auckland was by dray to the Puniu stream, along the Waipā River to its junction with the Waikato. Near the Waikato Heads travellers entered the small Awaroa River. During summer it was necessary to push or pull the waka through to the Manukau Harbour at Waiuku. By the 1850s a small bullock track had been established to Auckland via the settlements of Mauku, Drury, Papakura and Otahuhu, or waka could take the sea route across the Manukau to Ihumatao (where Auckland International Airport is now). The main tribe to use this route and the main traders were the Maniapoto tribe. They occupied an area of fertile land south of Te Awamutu at Kihikihi and Rangiaowhia. Maniapoto sold wheat, peaches, potatoes and other food to Auckland and bought back shirts, sugar, tobacco and rum. The boom time ended in 1856–1857 with the end of the Australian gold rush, allowing importing of cheaper food, especially flour, from Australia. Even in the boom time of 1854–55, food grown by Waikato Māori, such as Ngāti Maniapoto, was taken to the Auckland market in very small amounts compared to food from the Waiheke Island -Thames area. In early 1855 Ngāti Maniapoto took only 3 canoes of potatoes to Auckland compared to 279 canoes containing a much wider variety of food from the Thames area. Missionaries had also established schools for Māori. Benjamin and Harriet Ashwell ran a school for 50 Māori girls aged 6–17 at Taupiri in 1853. The girls had been at the school for up to 3 years and could read and write in English and do mental arithmetic.

At the time of the Waikato campaign of 1863 against the rebel Māori King Movement forces, the population was estimated by the government at about 3,500 Māori.

During the late 1850s Maniapoto in particular become disgruntled in their dealings with Pakeha. They complained about the way they were treated in Auckland by traders but their chief complaint was that the government was underpaying them for land they were selling. The average price paid by government was 6d per acre but it was sold to settlers for 10/- per acre. The government argued that it had to pay for surveying and administration costs but to Māori it seemed unfair. Before the elevation of the first Māori king there was a wide range of opinions among influential Māori with some such as Wirimu Tamihana&#x27;s father advocating supporting the Crown while Te Heuheu of Tuwharetoa advocated all out war against the government. This view was initially unpopular as the king movement hoped to work alongside the crown. Māori were upset at the number of children that had been fathered by Pakeha, who had then disappeared. The children were left to be raised by their mothers with general hapu support. John Gorst, a well-educated government agent, reported significant numbers of half-caste children in the Waikato in the late 1850s. However, in the Ngati Maniapoto iwi at least 7 Pakeha integrated successfully with the tribe from 1842, marrying Maori women. The best known are William Searancke, who became an important government agent, and Frenchman Louis Hetet, who became a successful trader. Their half-caste children lived with the iwi, and some became leading figures.

What tipped the balance was conflict and criminal activity within the Waikato region. Influential chiefs said the treaty had promised the government would help maintain peace. They asked for government magistrates and courts. The government attempted to fulfil these requests but many of the young men who put themselves forward for the positions simply saw that they had an opportunity to get wealthy at the government&#x27;s expense. This upset the older chiefs, who wanted the strong Māori leader Te Wherowhero to return from Mangere to his lands at Tamahere (South Hamilton) to rein in the out-of-control young chief magistrates.

The Waikato has a prominent history, particularly regarding relationships between Māori and European in early colonial New Zealand. The Waikato was within the defined boundaries of the colonial provinces of New Ulster (1841–1853) and Auckland (1853–1876) but was principally Māori. During the land wars of the 1860s, the Waikato was the scene of five battles in what is referred to as the Invasion of the Waikato. In retaliation for the help Waikato Māori (mainly Ngāti Maniapoto) gave Taranaki Māori in their conflict over land in the earlier First Taranaki War, and the decision by some Waikato &quot;hapu&quot; to form a separate kingdom – the King Movement or &quot;Kingitanga&quot; – in opposition to the government, the colonial government, with the help of troops brought from Britain and Queenite Māori loyal to the Crown, pushed south from the main settlement of Auckland, fighting against Waikato raiders in Auckland before venturing into the Waikato to attack the combined &quot;hapu&quot; of the King Movement. During 1863 and 1864 fighting occurred at Pukekohe East, Titi hill, Burtts Farm, Galloway Redoubt, Kiri Kiri, Martyn&#x27;s Farm, Patumahoe, Rhodes Clearing, Williamson&#x27;s Clearing, Otau, Camerontown, Kakaramea and Wairoa ranges (all Auckland), Meremere, Rangiriri, Ngāruawāhia, Rangiaowhia (southwest of Cambridge), Hairini Ridge and Ōrākau (near Kihikihi), all resulting in defeat for the &quot;Kingitanga&quot; forces. Eventually the rebel King Movement forces pulled back to positions in the area to the south of the Punui River in South Waikato, still known as the King Country, after 19 defeats by the British. &quot;Rewi&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, one of New Zealand&#x27;s first motion pictures, in 1925, portrayed an entertaining, fictionalized version of the Ōrākau siege.

The headquarters of the Māori King Movement are now at Turangawaewae Marae at Ngāruawāhia.

After the end of the war and the withdrawal of British and Australian troops, the region experienced a long period of economic recession after 1866. Most Māori had moved to the King Country and European settlers were more attracted to the South Island with its large gold discovery in Otago and the more easily farmed Canterbury Plains. The Waikato had poor land access and was not suitable for sheep farming which dominated livestock production in New Zealand until the 1890s invention of refrigeration. Dairying and the completion of the main trunk railway line at the turn of the century lead to a small, steady increase in population. After 1900, dairy production in the Waikato continued to grow, exporting butter and cheese mainly to Britain.

=== Local government history ===
Following major floods in 1907, a Waikato River Board was formed in 1911. However, it was reported as ineffective in 1921 and ceased to operate, though the need for a replacement was considered in 1933.

Hauraki Catchment Board was set up in 1946.

Major floods also occurred in 1953 and 1956. Waikato Valley Authority was established by the Waikato Valley Authority Act on 26 October 1956. The Water and Soil Conservation Act 1967 extended it to become a Catchment/Regional Water Board. The Ministry of Works and Development Abolition Act 1988, left WVA with that work and it became the Waikato Catchment Board.

The Waikato United Council, was formulated under the Local Government Act 1974, but due to objections excluded Thames/Coromandel district, though otherwise covered the present extent of the region. It was set up under the Town and Country Planning Act 1977 and the Waikato Region Constitution Order 1980. WUC covered Hamilton City, Huntly, Ngāruawāhia, Cambridge, Te Awamutu, Matamata, Putāruru and Tokoroa boroughs, Matamata, Raglan, Waikato, and Waipa counties, Ōtorohanga and Waitomo districts. It took over the Hamilton Regional Planning Authority and mainly dealt with regional planning and civil defence. By 1989, WUC had committees for regional planning, civil defence, regional government, and the Waikato Regional Development Board. From 1987 it also included Thames-Coromandel District, Great Barrier Island, Hauraki Plains, Ohinemuri and Piako counties, and Morrinsville, Paeroa, Te Aroha and Waihi boroughs.

On 1 November 1989, Waikato Regional Council was established by the Local Government (Waikato Region) Reorganisation Order 1989. from 40 former authorities:- 2 catchment boards (Hauraki and Waikato), 3 united councils (Waikato, Thames Valley and part of Tongariro), 12 noxious plants authorities, 11 pest destruction boards and 12 drainage boards. The Land Transport Act 1998 added transport to WRC&#x27;s responsibilities. From 1 November 2010 Environment Waikato took over the southern parts of Franklin District. That seems to be the only legislation naming it &#x27;Environment Waikato&#x27;, which had been its operating name until 2011, shortly after the &#x27;Rates Control Team&#x27; won about half the seats in the 2010 election.

== Politics ==
In the 2010 local government elections, the Waikato Region had the country&#x27;s lowest rate of returned votes. Since then the percentage turnout has declined further.

==People==
The people of the Waikato use the nickname Mooloo to apply to themselves or to their region, particularly in relation to sporting endeavours. The word was likely first applied to the Waikato provincial rugby team. Its origin is related to the mascot of a pantomime-like milking cow used in parades, public events and sports matches — particularly rugby, reflecting the importance of the dairy industry to the region. Waikato hosts the Chiefs Super Rugby team and Waikato Mitre 10 Cup rugby team at Waikato Stadium and the Northern Districts Knights in domestic cricket at Seddon Park, both in Hamilton.

<text>The Waikato River is the longest river in New Zealand, running for through the North Island. It rises on the eastern slopes of Mount Ruapehu, joining the Tongariro River system and flowing through Lake Taupō, New Zealand&#x27;s largest lake. It then drains Taupō at the lake&#x27;s northeastern edge, creates the Huka Falls, and flows northwest through the Waikato Plains. It empties into the Tasman Sea south of Auckland, at Port Waikato. It gives its name to the Waikato region that surrounds the Waikato Plains. The present course of the river was largely formed about 17,000 years ago. Contributing factors were climate warming, forest being reestablished in the river headwaters and the deepening, rather than widening, of the existing river channel. The channel was gradually eroded as far up river as Piarere, leaving the old Hinuera channel through the Hinuera Gap high and dry. The remains of the old course are seen clearly at Hinuera, where the cliffs mark the ancient river edges. The Waikato&#x27;s main tributary is the Waipā River, which converges with it at Ngāruawāhia.

The name &quot;Waikato&quot; comes from the Māori language and translates as &quot;flowing water&quot;. The Waikato River has spiritual meaning for various local Māori tribes, including the large Tainui, who regard it as a source of their mana, or pride. The widely respected marae of Tūrangawaewae is close to its banks at Ngāruawāhia.

For many years the Tainui tribe have sought to re-establish their links to the river after the New Zealand Wars (see Invasion of the Waikato) and the subsequent confiscations of the 1860s, and are continuing negotiations with the New Zealand government. The Tainui iwi was advised not to bring a case for the river before the Waitangi Tribunal as they would not win. An out-of-court settlement was arranged and the deed of settlement signed by the Crown and Waikato-Tainui in August 2008 settled the raupatu claim to the Waikato River, although other claims for land blocks and harbours are still outstanding. Waikato-Tainui now have joint management of the river with Waikato Regional Council.

==Origin==
The ancestral Waikato River flowed from an ancient lake (Lake Huka) in the centre of the North Island through deep gorges of welded ignimbrite and rhyolite, northward through the Hinuera Valley and Hauraki Basin into the Thames Estuary. It is possible that the river flowed through the Waikato Basin about a million years ago before returning to its Hinuera course. After the huge Oruanui eruption 27,000 years ago ignimbrite was showered all over the North Island to a thickness of . A new lake was formed – Lake Taupō. The water accumulated until a new outlet was forced above the present lake level, near Waihora Bay. Over the next few thousand years the bed of the river was raised by large amounts of eruption debris. Then the original, blocked outlet suddenly gave way; the lake level fell as about of water and debris poured out in a catastrophic breakthrough flood causing the river to change course near Piarere. The Hinuera Gap and Waitoa River are evidence of the river&#x27;s former course. The water level dropped quickly and the river stayed in this new course through the Maungatautari gorge and Hamilton Basin. Deposits show that the Waikato River was already in the Waikato Basin 21,800 years ago.

==Course==

The river starts in the form of many small streams on the eastern slopes of Mount Ruapehu. The Mangatoetoenui Glacier (once also called the Waikato Glacier) is one of the principal sources. The southernmost tributary is called the Upper Waikato Stream. The Waipakihi River joins the Waikato from the Kaimanawa Mountains to the west. From the point where the river meets the Waihohonu Stream, down to Lake Taupō, it has been formally named the Tongariro River since 1945.

The Poutu Stream joins from Lake Rotoaira to the east, as a tributary of the Tongariro, which flows northward, with State Highway 1 in parallel, through the town of Tūrangi, and into the southern side of Lake Taupō. Extensive engineering of lakes, tunnels and canals are used to generate hydroelectric power in the Tongariro Power Scheme.

The Waikato River flows out of Lake Taupō at the town of Taupō in Tapuaeharuru Bay at the northeast end of the lake. It flows northeast past the town, alongside State Highway 1, to the Huka Falls. State Highway 5 runs more or less parallel to the river as it flows further northeast. About from the lake, the river flows west and into the southern end of Lake Ohakuri. It exits from the northwest end of that lake and flows west through the small Lake Atiamuri and into the long east–west oriented Lake Whakamaru, with State Highway 30 following its course. It passes northwest through Lake Maraetai and Lake Waipapa, where it is joined by the Waipapa River, then north through Lake Arapuni and into Lake Karapiro. Pokaiwhenua Stream joins the river in Lake Karapiro. Nine hydroelectric power stations at eight dams extract energy from the river between Taupō and Karapiro. All the lakes in this stretch of the river (apart from Lake Taupō) are artificial.

The river leaves the Volcanic Plateau at Karapiro, where it emerges from the Maungatautari Gorge, and flows northwest into the Waikato Basin, flowing through the towns of Cambridge, Hamilton, and Ngāruawāhia. It is joined by its largest tributary, the Waipā River, at Ngāruawāhia. It then flows north through the Taupiri Gorge to enter the lower Waikato region. Further north is Huntly and then Meremere, where the Whangamarino and Maramarua Rivers join it. From Mercer, where the Mangatawhiri River joins it, the Waikato flows west and southwest. Just before its mouth at Port Waikato, the Araroa River joins from the north. Numerous small islands lie in the long, thin delta of the river as it passes through low-lying swampy land between Meremere and the coast, the largest of which is Motutieke Island.

There are also over 40 islands between Ngāruawāhia and Tuakau, depending on the level of the river. Maurea Islands, just south of Rangiriri were subject to a restoration trial to test comparative weed treatments, the main weeds being alder and yellow flag iris.

In prehistoric times, the Waikato&#x27;s course has occasionally shifted to flow north through the Hinuera Gap into the Firth of Thames and from there into the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana. The most recent occasion this is known to have occurred ended some 20,000 years ago, although it is possible that it also flowed north more recently, until about 1800 years ago. A remnant of this former course can be seen as a spur on Lake Karapiro to the south of the settlement of Piarere. The river&#x27;s current course is largely the result of the massive Hatepe eruption of the Taupō Volcano in 180 AD.

The mean discharge of the Waikato River is , with the highest flows typically occurring in July and August. Specific mean annual floods are low (60–70 L s-1 km-2), and the frequency of events with greater than 3 times the median flow is 0.4 events / year, due to flow regulation and groundwater storage in pumice.

==Human use==
As well as being a water and recreation resource, the river was historically a critical communications and transport link for the communities along it. It took about 3 days to paddle a waka from Waiuku to the Cambridge/Te Awamutu area. Taupō, Mangakino, Cambridge, Hamilton, Horotiu, Ngāruawāhia, Huntly, Hampton Downs, Meremere, Waiuku and Port Waikato are on or close to it. The Waikato River in Hamilton is frequently used by rowers, kayakers and powered pleasure craft. Water-skiers and jet skis have zones outside the city limits where they can be used.

The river was of military importance in the land wars between New Zealand settler and Kingitanga forces during 1863–64 and significant battles were fought. Three shallow draft gunboats were designed in New Zealand and built in Sydney in kitset form; the hulk of the paddle steamer Rangiriri is preserved at Hamilton. In addition locally sourced barges were rebuilt with steel plating to carry troops and supplies. In support of these invasions, New Zealand developed its first &quot;navy&quot;, the Waikato Flotilla, run by an Australian Francis Cadell who was presented with a gold watch and diamonds by the New Zealand government in recognition of his service. A cemetery containing the graves of the British military dead can be found at Rangiriri opposite the hotel, shops and cafe.

===Electricity generation===

The Waikato&#x27;s first hydro-electric power station was the Horahora Power Station, now located under the Horahora bridge deep beneath the surface of Lake Karapiro. Horahora was built to supply electricity for the Martha gold mines at Waihi.

The river has a series of eight dams and nine hydro-electric power stations that generate electricity for the national grid. These were constructed between 1929 and 1971 to meet growing demand for electricity.

The power scheme begins at Lake Taupō, which has control gates to regulate the flow of water into the river. Once released through the gates it takes over 18 hours for the water to flow to the last power station at Karapiro. On its journey downstream it passes through power stations at Aratiatia, Ohakuri, Atiamuri, Whakamaru, Maraetai, Waipapa, Arapuni and Karapiro.

Approximately 4000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity is generated annually by the scheme, which is around 13% of New Zealand&#x27;s total electrical generating capacity.

The river also provides cooling water for the coal/natural gas fired thermal power station at Huntly. The power station uses river water as a cooling medium for the old steam units, which means that large quantities of warm water is returned to the river. To limit environmental impacts, conditions are imposed by its resource consent, specifying the quantity of water that can be removed by the station along with the maximum temperature of the water when returned to the river, . These conditions mean that output of the older steam units can be restricted, especially on very hot summer days. In 2006, a cooling tower was installed. This allows one 250 MW unit to run at full load even during such times.

=== Drinking water ===

After widescale droughts in 1994, the use of the Waikato River to supply drinking water for Auckland was first considered. In July 2002, a water treatment plant was opened at Tuakau, which was expanded in 2021 after major droughts in 2020.

=== Recreation ===
The lower Waikato is popular for duck shooting.

==== Boating ====
The Waikato is renowned among whitewater kayaking enthusiasts, specifically for the Full James rapid located north of Taupō. The Full James was the site of the 1999 World Whitewater Championships, as well as the pre-World event the year before.

Lake Karapiro (an artificial lake) is regarded as one of New Zealand&#x27;s best rowing venues. The World Rowing Championships in 1978 and 2010, and the 1950 British Empire Games were hosted at Karapiro.

The section of the river that flows through Hamilton has the most diverse river traffic with many schools and clubs using rowing skiffs. Rowing races are also held on the river. Jet skis are confined to the city margins because of their noise. Power boats regularly use the river, including manufacturers and boating shops testing and demonstrating boats, especially in summer. In addition there are numerous kayaks and a few waka.

There are council boat ramps, run by Waikato District, Hamilton City, South Waikato District and Taupō District, at Port Waikato Rd; Hoods Landing Rd, Otaua; Elbow Rd, Aka aka; River Rd, Tuakau; Riverbank Rd, Mercer; Churchill East Rd, Rangiriri; Ohinewai Landing Rd; Boatie Reserve SH1, Parry St and Riverview Rd, Huntly; SH1 Taupiri; Waikato Esplanade, Ngāruawāhia; Farm and Braithwaite Parks, Pukete; Swarbricks Landing, Hamilton Pde, Pine Beach, Ferrybank, Memorial Park, Roose Commerce Park, Hayes Paddock, Hamilton Gardens; Narrows Lane, Tamahere; Karapiro (6 ramps); Arapuni (4); Maraetai; Whakamaru (3); Ohakuri and Mangakino.
==== Public cruises ====
A ferry service along part of its length was for years conducted by Caesar Roose, several of whose descendants still live beside it. He brought the 1894 400-passenger steamer &quot;Manuwai&quot; from the Whanganui in 1920. In 1924 a Cambridge to Port Waikato excursion was being run 2 or 3 times a year, taking 12 to 14 hours downstream and a few hours longer upstream; for example steamers in 1939 took about 90 minutes from Ngāruawāhia to Hamilton. &quot;Manuwai&quot; sank at her moorings in 1938, but was taken to Mercer for repair in 1939, where she was converted to a barge. Several of the old steamers remain under, or beside the river, including the &quot;Manuwai&quot;, &quot;Rawhiti&quot; (built 1925) and &quot;Freetrader&quot; on the west bank just south of Mercer. A 1928 article listed 14 boats that had provided river services. To improve navigation, rocks in the Narrows at Tamahere were removed in 1919.

Public cruises operate from Aratiatia to Huka Falls, across the river to Orakei Korako, from Hamilton Gardens to Mystery Creek and Fairfield Bridge and, since 2009, from Tuakau to Port Waikato.

On 19 July 2021 a ferry service began on the river in Hamilton, linking Swarbrick&#x27;s Landing and Braithwaite Park with the museum and gardens. Services ended with liquidation of the company in September 2022.

==== Cycle and walk trails ====
Three trails follow parts of the river.

Boosted by New Zealand Cycle Trail funding, the Waikato River Trails, a series of connected river cycling trails in the South Waikato. The River Trail has five sections, open to both walkers or bikes, between Lake Karapiro and Aratiatia. It opened in 2011.

Te Awa River Ride runs for following the river from Horahora, near the end of the Waikato River Trails, via Cambridge and Hamilton to Ngāruawāhia. Completion was planned for 2017, but the Cambridge-Hamilton section opening was further delayed from 2021 and opened on 9 December 2022. North of AFFCO at Horotiu, the route includes the second longest cycle bridge in the country (after the Timber Trail), a long cable network arch bridge, budgeted to cost $2.6m and to open in August, but opened in November 2017. The section from the Avantidrome through St Peter&#x27;s School of Cambridge and Tamahere was being constructed in 2019/2020, including an underpass at SH21 to Tamahere Park.

Te Araroa (the walkway running the length of the country) follows the Waikato for most of its between Mercer and Hamilton.

==Ecology==

=== Species ===
The Waikato River and its hydro lakes are home to at least 19 types of native fish and 10 types of introduced fish. The introduced species include rainbow and brown trout providing what has been called &quot;the finest fly-fishing in the world&quot;. Other introduced species, like the carp and mosquitofish, have become major pests.

=== Environmental issues ===

The large catchment area of the Waikato River is highly fertile farmland, so intensive agriculture is present. Due to the agricultural activity within the catchment significant agricultural pollution is leached into groundwater and contained in the runoff. The mismanagement of nitrogen fertilizer and effluent spreading practices in dairy farming is seen as the major causes of this pollution. Since 2000 Environment Waikato has joined with conservation minded farmers to bring about more efficient and scientific use of fertilizers.

The removal of the native vegetation throughout the catchment to accommodate the increasing demand for farmland has contributed to the silting-up of the river with loose soils from eroded farmland, although most of the silting is due to the construction of the many hydrodams. In its pre-1930s wild state, the silt was flushed from the river every winter by flood surges. The remnants of these can be seen in the silt channels carved out of what is now St Andrews golf course, adjacent to the river in Hamilton.

Arsenic enters the river at concentrations that reach 0.035 grams of arsenic per cubic metre in places, exceeding the WHO provisional guideline of 0.01 grams of arsenic per cubic metre and making the water unsuitable for drinking water unless treated. The majority of arsenic in the Waikato River comes from the Wairakei Geothermal Power Station. The amount of arsenic gradually declines as the river flows northwards and is at its lowest at the Waikato River Heads.

Since 2002, around of water a day has been drawn from the river at Tuakau, treated and pumped along a pipe north to Auckland, where it is mixed with local water. This met 8% of Auckland&#x27;s water needs in 2010/11. In December 2012 capacity was increased to , and in 2013 work started to increase it to . The treatment plant meets New Zealand&#x27;s 2000 drinking water standards according to Water Care NZ. This is equal to or better than the A standard for Auckland&#x27;s other water supplies.

Slightly-modified human wastes are pumped into the river downriver of several towns. Hamilton city has one of the most modern water treatment systems in the world following a 2003 report by GHB water consultants. In 2007 $22 million was spent upgrading the existing intake station south of the city at Riverlea. This will meet the cities demand until 2016. Waste water in its untreated state is 99.9% water and 0.1% other matter. A series of sophisticated machines produce clean water of a high standard getting rid of bad tastes odours and toxins to meet the upgraded NZ water standards. The Pukete 2 project which started in 2002 will upgrade the plant in a series of stages costing $24 million.

A further issue is industrial and metropolitan waste from early-established landfills and waste-emitting factories on the banks of the river. These include an unlined waste dump at Horotiu, just downriver from Hamilton, whose leachates include persistent organic pollutants such as dieldrin in quantities toxic to freshwater marine life. The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website.

<text>Edward William Brooke III (October 26, 1919 – January 3, 2015) was an American lawyer and Republican Party politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 1967 to 1979. He was the first African American elected to the United States Senate by popular vote. Prior to serving in the Senate, he served as the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from 1963 until 1967. Edward Brooke was the first African-American since Reconstruction in 1874 to have been elected to the United States Senate and he was the first African-American since 1881 to have held a United States Senate seat. Brooke was also the first African-American U.S. senator to ever be re-elected. He was the longest-serving African-American U.S. senator until surpassed by Tim Scott in 2025.

Born to a middle-class black family, Brooke was raised in Washington, D.C. After attending Howard University, he graduated from Boston University School of Law in 1948 after serving in the U.S. Army during World War II. Beginning in 1950, he became involved in politics, when he ran for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. After serving as chairman of the Boston Finance Commission, Brooke was elected attorney general in 1962, becoming the first African-American to be elected attorney general of any state.

He served as attorney general for four years, before running for Senate in 1966. In the election, he defeated Democratic former Governor Endicott Peabody in a landslide, and was seated on January 3, 1967. In the Senate, Brooke aligned with the liberal faction in the Republican party. He co-wrote the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited housing discrimination. He was re-elected to a second term in 1972, after defeating attorney John Droney. Brooke became a prominent critic of Republican President Richard Nixon, and was the first Senate Republican to call for Nixon&#x27;s resignation in light of the Watergate scandal. In 1978, he ran for a third term, but was defeated by Democrat Paul Tsongas. After leaving the Senate, Brooke practiced law in Washington, D.C., and was affiliated with various businesses and nonprofit organizations. Brooke died in 2015, at his home in Coral Gables, Florida, at the age of 95, and was the last living former U.S. senator born in the 1910s.

== Early life and education ==
Edward William Brooke III was born on October 26, 1919, in Washington, D.C., to a middle-class black family. His father Edward William Brooke Jr. was a lawyer and graduate of Howard University who worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and his mother was Helen (née Seldon) Brooke. He was the second of three children. Brooke was raised in a racially segregated environment that was &quot;insulated from the harsh realities of the Deep South&quot;, with Brooke rarely interacting with the white community. He attended Dunbar High School—then one of the most prestigious academic high schools for African Americans—and graduated in 1936. After graduating, he enrolled in Howard University, where he first considered studying in medicine, before ending up studying social studies and political science. Brooke graduated from university in 1941, with a bachelor of science degree, After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Brooke graduated from the Boston University School of Law in 1948. &quot;I never studied much at Howard,&quot; he later reflected, &quot;but at Boston University, I didn&#x27;t do much else but study.&quot;

==Military service==

Brooke enlisted in the United States Army in 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He saw combat in Italy as a member of the segregated 366th Infantry Regiment. Brooke spent 195 days with his unit in Italy. There, his fluent Italian and his light skin enabled him to cross enemy lines to communicate with Italian partisans. By the end of the war, Brooke had attained the rank of captain, a Bronze Star Medal, and a Distinguished Service Award.

Brooke&#x27;s time in the army exposed him to the inequality and racism which existed in the army system. This, combined with the signing of Executive Order 9066, led him to rethink his support of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His time in the army also changed his perception of race, with him meeting his future-wife Remigia Ferrari-Scacco in Italy. He reasoned that &quot;race had not mattered during our courtship in Italy, and therefore it should not have mattered in the United States&quot;.

== Early career ==
After graduating from Boston University, Brooke worked as a lawyer. He declined offers to join established law firms, instead opening his own law practice in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston.

===Politics===
Brooke began his foray in politics in 1950, when, at the urging of friends from his former army unit, Brooke ran for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Brooke didn&#x27;t affiliate with both of the major parties, choosing instead to run in both the Democratic and Republican primaries. He won the Republican nomination, and was endorsed by the party, but lost the general election in a landslide to his Democratic opponent. Two years later, he ran again for the same seat, but again lost the election to the same Democratic opponent. In 1960, Brooke ran for secretary of state (which, in Massachusetts, is styled &quot;Secretary of the Commonwealth&quot;); he won the Republican nomination, becoming the first black person to be nominated for statewide office in Massachusetts. However, he lost the election to future mayor of Boston Kevin White, whose campaign issued a bumper sticker saying, &quot;Vote White,&quot; which some took as a reference to Brooke&#x27;s race. 

Despite losing the secretary&#x27;s race to White, the closeness of the results led to Republican leaders taking notice of Brooke&#x27;s potential. Governor John Volpe sought to reward Brooke for his efforts, and offered him a number of jobs, most of them judicial in nature. Seeking a position with a higher political profile, Brooke eventually accepted the position of Finance Commission of Boston, where he investigated financial irregularities and uncovered evidence of corruption in city affairs. He was described in the press as having &quot;the tenacity of a terrier&quot;, and it was reported that he &quot;restore[d] to vigorous life an agency which many had thought moribund.&quot; He parlayed his achievements into a successful election as Attorney General of Massachusetts in 1962, becoming the first African-American to be elected attorney general of any state.

As attorney general, Brooke gained a reputation as a vigorous prosecutor of organized crime and corruption, securing convictions against a number of members of the administration of governor Foster Furcolo; an indictment against Furcolo was dismissed due to lack of evidence. He also coordinated with local police departments on the Boston Strangler case, although the press mocked him for permitting an alleged psychic to participate in the investigation. In 1964, following the nomination of Barry Goldwater as the Republican party&#x27;s nominee for president, Brooke found Goldwater&#x27;s nomination offensive. He publicly broke with the party, and implored Republicans &quot;not to invest in the &#x27;pseudo-conservatism&#x27; of zealots&quot;. His public repudiation of Goldwater actually helped Brooke win re-election in 1964, as he won by a plurality of nearly 800,000. Encouraged by an outpour of positive support, Brooke continued to offer blunt criticisms of the Republicans, though he began softening his rhetoric by proposing strategies to rebuild the Republican party. This included an off-year national convention to &quot;hammer out an agreement for the future of the party&quot; and &quot;draft a responsible platform to address bread-and-butter issues&quot;. By 1965, Brooke had emerged as the main Republican spokesman for racial equality, despite &quot;never rallying his race to challenge segregation barriers with the inspirational fervor of a Martin Luther King.&quot;

==U.S. Senate==
=== First term (1967–1973) ===

At the November 8, 1966, Massachusetts Senate election, Brooke defeated former Governor Endicott Peabody with 1,213,473 votes to Peabody&#x27;s 744,761, and served as a United States senator for two terms, from January 3, 1967, to January 3, 1979. The black vote had, &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;no measurable bearing&quot; on the election as less than 3% of the state&#x27;s population was black, and Peabody also supported civil rights for blacks. Brooke said, &quot;I do not intend to be a national leader of the Negro people&quot;, and the magazine said that he &quot;condemned both Stokely Carmichael and Georgia&#x27;s Lester Maddox&quot; as extremists; his historic election nonetheless gave Brooke &quot;a 50-state constituency&quot;, the magazine wrote, &quot;a power base that no other Senator can claim&quot;.

Brooke said &quot;In all my years in the Senate, I never encountered an overt act of hostility&quot;. He recalled visiting the swimming pool at the Russell Senate Office Building, where segregationists John C. Stennis, John Little McClellan, and Strom Thurmond invited the new senator to join them in the water. &quot;There was no hesitation or ill will that I could see. Yet these were men who consistently voted against legislation that would have provided equal opportunity to others of my race ... it was increasingly evident that some members of the Senate played on bigotry purely for political gain&quot;.

==== Tenure ====
A member of the moderate-to-liberal Northeastern wing of the Republican Party, Brooke organized the Senate&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday Club&quot; of progressive Republicans who met for Wednesday lunches and strategy discussions. Brooke, who supported Michigan Governor George W. Romney and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s bids for the 1968 GOP presidential nomination against Richard Nixon&#x27;s, often differed with President Nixon on matters of social policy and civil rights. In 1967, Brooke was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.

In 1967, Brooke went to Vietnam on a three-week trip as a fact-finding mission. During his first formal speech in the Senate following the trip, he reversed his previous position on the Vietnam War that increased negotiations with the North Vietnamese rather than an escalation of the fighting were needed. He began to favor President Johnson&#x27;s &quot;patient&quot; approach to Vietnam as he had been convinced that &quot;the enemy is not disposed to participate in any meaningful negotiations&quot;.

By his second year in the Senate, Brooke had taken his place as a leading advocate against discrimination in housing and on behalf of affordable housing. With Walter Mondale, a Minnesota Democrat and fellow member of the Senate Banking Committee, he co-authored the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing. The Act also created HUD&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity as the primary enforcer of the law. President Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act into law on April 11, one week after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Dissatisfied with the weakened enforcement provisions that emerged from the legislative process, Brooke repeatedly proposed stronger provisions during his Senate career. In 1969, Congress enacted the &quot;Brooke Amendment&quot; to the federal publicly assisted housing program which limited the tenants&#x27; out-of-pocket rent expenditure to 25 percent of their income. Additionally, Brooke voted in favor of the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

During the Nixon presidency, Brooke opposed repeated Administration attempts to close down the Job Corps and the Office of Economic Opportunity and to weaken the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—all foundational elements of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society.

In 1969, Brooke spoke at Wellesley College&#x27;s commencement against &quot;coercive protest&quot; and was understood by some students as calling protesters &quot;elite s&quot; Then student government president Hillary Rodham departed from her planned speech to rebut Brooke&#x27;s words, affirming the &quot;indispensable task of criticizing and constructive protest,&quot; for which she was featured in &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

On June 9, 1969, Brooke voted in favor of President Nixon&#x27;s nomination of Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States following the retirement of Earl Warren. Brooke was a leader of the bipartisan coalition that defeated the Senate confirmation of Clement Haynsworth, President Nixon&#x27;s nominee to the Supreme Court on November 21, 1969. A few months later, he again organized sufficient Republican support to defeat Nixon&#x27;s third Supreme Court nominee Harrold Carswell on April 8, 1970. The following month, Nixon nominee Harry Blackmun (who later wrote the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; opinion) was confirmed on May 12, 1970, with Brooke voting in favor. On December 6, 1971, Brooke voted in favor of Nixon&#x27;s nomination of Lewis F. Powell Jr., while on December 10, Brooke voted against Nixon&#x27;s nomination of William Rehnquist as Associate Justice. On December 17, 1975, Brooke voted in favor of President Gerald Ford&#x27;s nomination of John Paul Stevens to the Supreme Court.

=== Second term (1973–1979) ===
==== Relations with the White House and 1972 election ====
Despite Brooke&#x27;s disagreements with Nixon, the president reportedly respected the senator&#x27;s abilities; after Nixon&#x27;s election he had offered to make Brooke a member of his cabinet, or appoint him as ambassador to the UN. The press discussed Brooke as a possible replacement for Spiro Agnew as Nixon&#x27;s running mate in the 1972 presidential election. While Nixon retained Agnew, Brooke was re-elected in 1972, defeating Democrat John J. Droney by a vote of 64%–35%. Edward Brooke was the first African American ever to have been re-elected to the United States Senate.

==== Tenure ====
Before the first year of his second term ended, Brooke became the first Republican to call on President Nixon to resign, on November 4, 1973, shortly after the Watergate-related &quot;Saturday night massacre&quot;. He repeated the recommendation in a meeting with Nixon at the White House on November 13, 1973. He had risen to become the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and on two powerful Appropriations subcommittees, Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Foreign Operations. From these positions, Brooke defended and strengthened the programs he supported; for example, he was a leader in enactment of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which ensured married women the right to establish credit in their own name.

In 1974, with Indiana senator Birch Bayh, Brooke led the fight to retain Title IX, a 1972 amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965, which guarantees equal educational opportunity (including athletic participation) to girls and women.

In 1975, with the extension and expansion of the Voting Rights Act at stake, Brooke faced Stennis in &quot;extended debate&quot; and won the Senate&#x27;s support for the extension. In 1976, he also took on the role of supporter of wide-scale, legalized abortion. The Appropriations bill for HHS became the battleground over this issue because it funds Medicaid. The Anti-abortion movement fought, eventually successfully, to prohibit funding for abortions of low-income women insured by Medicaid. Brooke led the fight against restrictions in the Senate Appropriations Committee and in the House–Senate Conference until his defeat. The press again speculated on his possible candidacy for the Vice Presidency as Gerald Ford&#x27;s running mate in 1976, with &quot;Time&quot; calling him an &quot;able legislator and a staunch party loyalist&quot;.

In Massachusetts, Brooke&#x27;s support among Catholics weakened due to his stance on abortion. During the 1978 re-election campaign, the state&#x27;s bishops spoke in opposition to his leading role.

===Electoral history===









==Post-Senate life==
After leaving the Senate, Brooke practiced law in Washington, D.C., first as a partner at the Washington firm of O&#x27;Connor &amp; Hannan; later of counsel to Csaplar &amp; Bok in Boston. He also served as chairman of the board of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. In 1984 he was selected as chairman of the Boston Bank of Commerce, and one year later was named to the board of directors of Grumman.

In 1992, a Brooke assistant stated in a plea agreement as part of an investigation into corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that Brooke had falsely answered questions about whether he or the assistant had tried to improperly influence HUD officials on behalf of housing and real estate developers who had paid large consulting fees to Brooke. The HUD investigation ended with no charges being brought against Brooke.

In 1996, Brooke became the first chairman of the World Policy Council, a think tank of Alpha Phi Alpha, an African-American fraternity. The Council&#x27;s purpose is to expand the fraternity&#x27;s involvement in politics, and social and current policy to encompass international concerns. In 2006 Brooke served as the council&#x27;s chairman emeritus and was honorary chairman at the Centennial Convention of Alpha Phi Alpha held in Washington, D.C.

== Political positions ==
Edward Brooke was a self-described moderate or liberal Republican, generally referred to as Rockefeller Republicans. On social issues he was a liberal who supported civil rights, women&#x27;s rights, and civil liberties such as gay rights. On economic issues he was fiscally conservative, but was pragmatic about it; he still allowed that &quot;There are things that people can&#x27;t do for themselves and therefore government must do it for them&quot;.

During the 2008 presidential election, Brooke indicated in a WBUR-FM interview that he favored Democratic nominee Barack Obama.

==Awards and honors==
* Presidential Medal of Freedom 
* Congressional Gold Medal, presented on October 28, 2009, two days after Brooke&#x27;s 90th birthday At his 2009 Congressional Gold Medal Acceptance speech, Brooke scolded policymakers for excessive partisan bickering.
* Bronze Star Medal
* Adam Clayton Powell Award (Phoenix Award) in 1979
*Jeremy Nicholson Negro Achievement Award, acknowledging his outstanding contributions to the African-American community 
*The Edward W. Brooke Courthouse (dedicated June 20, 2000) in Boston; part of the Massachusetts Trial Court system and houses the Central Division of the Boston Municipal Court, Boston Juvenile Court, Family Court, and Boston Housing Court, among others. 
*In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Edward Brooke on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.

==Personal life and death==
Brooke had an affair with broadcast journalist Barbara Walters in the 1970s. Walters stated that the affair was ended to protect their careers from scandal.

Brooke went through a divorce late in his second term. His finances were investigated by the Senate, and John Kerry, then a prosecutor in Middlesex County, announced an investigation into statements Brooke made in the divorce case. Prosecutors eventually determined that Brooke had made false statements about his finances during the divorce, and that they were pertinent, but not material enough to have affected the outcome. Brooke was not charged with a crime, but the negative publicity cost him some support in his 1978 reelection campaign, and as a result he lost to Paul Tsongas.

In September 2002, Brooke was diagnosed with breast cancer and assumed a national role in raising awareness of the disease among men.

On January 3, 2015, Brooke died at his home in Coral Gables, Florida, at age 95. At the time of his death, he was the last living former U.S. senator born in the 1910s. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>was a Japanese amateur astronomer who discovered Comet C/1996 B2, also known as Comet Hyakutake on January 31, 1996, while using 25×150 binoculars.

Hyakutake graduated from the Kyushu Sangyo University as a photography major and started working at a newspaper in Fukuoka. He first became interested in astronomy after seeing Comet Ikeya–Seki in 1965. He began searching for comets in 1989. In 1993, he moved to Hayato for because “the skies were much clearer there” and so he could better continue his search for comets. His first discovery was Comet C/1995 Y1, on December 26, 1995.

Hyakutake discovered C/1996 B2 while looking for C/1995 Y1, a comet he had discovered a few weeks before.

He died in Kokubu, Kagoshima, in 2002 at age 51 of an aneurysm which had led to internal bleeding.

Asteroid 7291 Hyakutake is named after him.

<text>Comet Ikeya–Seki, formally designated C/1965 S1, 1965 VIII, and 1965f, was a long-period comet discovered independently by Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki. First observed as a faint telescopic object on 18 September 1965, the first calculations of its orbit suggested that on October 21, it would pass just above the Sun&#x27;s surface, and would probably become extremely bright.

Comets can defy such predictions, but Ikeya–Seki performed as expected. As it approached perihelion observers reported that it was clearly visible in the daytime sky next to the Sun. In Japan, where it reached perihelion at local noon, it was seen shining at magnitude −10. It proved to be one of the brightest comets seen in the last thousand years, and is sometimes known as the &quot;Great Comet of 1965&quot;.

The comet was seen to break into three pieces just before its perihelion passage. The three pieces continued in almost identical orbits, and the comet re-appeared in the morning sky in late October, showing a very bright tail. By early 1966, it had faded from view as it receded into the outer Solar System.

Ikeya–Seki is a member of the Kreutz sungrazers, which are suggested to be fragments of a large comet. 

== Discovery and observations ==

Comet Ikeya–Seki was independently discovered on 18 September 1965 by Japanese amateur astronomers Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki within roughly 15 minutes of each other. The recent passage of a typhoon had afforded favorably clear conditions for identifying the comet. Upon discovery, the comet was an 8th-magnitude object visually located 10° west of α Hydrae, moving east across the sky at around 1° per day; acceleration of the comet and significant brightening was observed shortly afterwards. Based on preliminary estimations of Ikeya–Seki&#x27;s orbit, Fred Whipple of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory conjectured that Ikeya–Seki was a sungrazing comet. Subsequent and more accurate computations of the comet&#x27;s orbital properties showed a close similarity between Ikeya–Seki and the Great Comet of 1882, including the calculated perihelion of 0.0079 AU (1.2 million km, 0.7 million mi). Leading up to perihelion, Ikeya–Seki&#x27;s light curve was also similar to the 1882 comet. The comet brightened to magnitude +4 by 7 October, with a tail extending to over 1° in length. By mid-October, the tail had extended to a length of 10°. The comet&#x27;s approach of the Sun visually placed the comet at increasingly lower altitude and brighter skies, leading to greater difficulty in estimating the comet&#x27;s brightness as perihelion drew nearer. Nonetheless, Ikeya–Seki&#x27;s increasing luminosity remained apparent; in the Southern Hemisphere, where visibility of the comet was most favorable around the time of perihelion, observers reported Ikeya–Sekit to be as bright as magnitude 0 by 18 October. The comet brightened considerably in the 60 hours after 18 October. By 20 October, the comet had become easily visible with the naked eye in daylight. Ikeya–Seki continued to brighten as perihelion approached, becoming comparable in brightness to the full Moon. The comet also projected a slightly curved tail; 2° of the tail was sufficiently visible to the naked eye with manual obscuration of the Sun.
In October–November 1965 the observation was conducted from Mauna Kea, Hawaii. One of the key findings from this study was the documentation of the comet&#x27;s rapid brightening and the detection of fragmentation in its nucleus. The images obtained provided evidence of the comet&#x27;s intense interaction with solar radiation and its effects on the comet&#x27;s physical structure.

Ikeya–Seki reached perihelion at 21:18 UTC on 21 October. As viewed from Earth, the comet and the Sun were separated by only a few arcminutes. Observations indicated that the comet&#x27;s nucleus began to break apart near the time of perihelion, with Japanese observers noting two small fragments detaching from the primary nucleus that later evaporated soon after. The comet faded after perihelion as it receded from the Sun, with the coma dimming to magnitude +3 by 26 October. However, its tail elongated, reaching a length of at least 15° by 26 October and reaching a maximum of nearly 30° in early November 1965. While the fragmented nucleus of Ikeya–Seki had hitherto remained close together, by 6 November two primary components had become visually distinct in both separation and brightness. Though the comet&#x27;s coma had dimmed to magnitude 7.4 by 27 November, a tail spanning 10° remained visible to the naked eye. The comet dimmed below naked-eye visibility by early December. The two components of Ikeya–Seki&#x27;s fractured nucleus remained apparent with increasing visual separation, moving apart at approximately ; one was brighter but more diffuse in appearance than the other. Extrapolation of the observed positions of the two nuclei calculated by Zdenek Sekanina suggested that the nuclei broke apart on 26 October. Similar calculations by H. Pohn of the United States Geological Survey yielded 26 October as the date of separation, though Sekanina believed Pohn&#x27;s calculation used different cometary fragments. By 1966, the two fragments were separated by nearly a full arcminute. Although Ikeya–Seki&#x27;s brightness closely paralleled the Great Comet of 1882, Ikeya–Seki dimmed much more rapidly after perihelion; while the 1882 comet was observed for up to eight months following perihelion, the last photographs of Ikeya–Seki were taken prior to mid-February 1966, after which the comet became fainter than magnitude +13. Ikeya–Seki was indiscernible in a 60-second exposure using a 40-inch reflector telescope at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station in mid-March 1966.

== Structure and composition ==

Observations obtained by the McMath–Pierce solar telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory detected emission lines associated with ionized calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, sodium, vanadium, and cyanide in Ikeya–Seki&#x27;s coma. The properties of the ionized iron and nickel lines suggested Ikeya–Seki reached an effective temperature of around 4800 K around perihelion.

== Observing campaigns ==
Ikeya–Seki&#x27;s perihelion presented a unique opportunity for astrophysical observations to be taken of a bright comet passing extremely close to the Sun. Additionally, the orientation of the comet&#x27;s orbit with respect to Earth&#x27;s was virtually ideal for observation of Ikeya–Seki. Several observatoriesincluding Kitt Peak National Observatory, Lick Observatory, and Haute-Provence Observatoryperformed spectrographic observations of the comet near perihelion, documenting strong emission lines associated with ionized calcium, iron, sodium, and other metals. Spectrograms were also obtained by a rocket launched from the White Sands Missile Range to observe the comet in ultraviolet. A pair of rocket launches from Wallops Island intended to provide similar data proved unsuccessful. Efforts at MIT and Harvard to detect radio emission from the comet yielded negative results. A Convair 990 operated by NASA out of Hawaii and a Boeing 707 with scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory were also involved in observational efforts targeting Ikeya–Seki. Gemini 6A was also planned to incorporate observation of the comet until the loss of the Agena target vehicle led to the cancellation of the original mission. Elizabeth Roemer remarked of the breadth of observational data in &quot;Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific&quot; that &quot;There seems no doubt that the appearance of Comet Ikeya–Seki will stand as a landmark in cometary physics.&quot;

<text>A baker is a tradesperson who bakes and sometimes sells breads and other products made of flour by using an oven or other concentrated heat source. The place where a baker works is called a bakery.

==History==
===Ancient history===
Since grains have been a staple food for millennia, the activity of baking is a very old one. Control of yeast, however, is relatively recent. By the fifth and sixth centuries BCE, the ancient Greeks used enclosed ovens heated by wood fires; communities usually baked bread in a large communal oven. Greeks baked dozens and possibly hundreds of types of bread; Athenaeus described seventy-two varieties.

In ancient Rome several centuries later, the first mass production of breads occurred, and &quot;the baking profession can be said to have started at that time.&quot; Ancient Roman bakers used honey and oil in their products, creating pastries rather than breads. In ancient Rome, bakers (Latin, &quot;pistor&quot;) were sometimes slaves, who were (like other slave-artisans) sometimes manumitted. Large households in Rome normally had their own bakers. During those times, most of the people used to bake their own bread but bakeries (pistrina) were popular all over the towns.

The Gauls are credited with discovering that the addition of beer froth to bread dough made well-leavened bread, marking the use of controlled yeast for bread dough.

===Medieval Europe===

In Medieval Europe, baking ovens were often separated from other buildings (and sometimes located outside city walls) to mitigate the risk of fire. Because bread was an important staple food, bakers&#x27; production factors (such as bolting yields, ingredients, and loaf sizes) were heavily regulated. For example, Henry III of England promulgated the Assize of Bread and Ale in 1267, subjecting all commercial bakers and brewers to various fees in order to practice their trade and imposing various regulations, such as inspection and verification of weights and measures, quality control, and price controls. Soon after the enactment of the Assize, &quot;baking became a very stable industry, and was executed much more professionally than brewing, resulting in towns and villages having fewer bakers than brewers.&quot; Because ovens were expensive capital investments and required careful operation, specialized bakeries opened.

Bakers were often part of the guild system, which was well-established by the sixteenth century: master bakers instructed apprentices and were assisted by journeymen. In Amsterdam in 1694, for example, the cake-bakers, pie-bakers, and rusk-bakers separated from an earlier Bread Bakers Guild and formed their own guild, regulating the trade. A fraternity of bakers in London existed as early as 1155, according to records of payments to the Exchequer; the Worshipful Company of Bakers was formed by charters dated 1486, 1569, and 1685. The guild still exists today, with mostly ceremonial and charitable functions. Five bakers have served as lord mayor of London.

A group of bakers is called a &quot;tabernacle&quot;.

===Ming dynasty China===
In Ming dynasty China, bakers were divided into different social statuses according to their customers. Bakers were among the thousands of servants who served in the Ming Palace, including recruited cooks, imperial eunuchs, and trained serving-women (&quot;Shangshiju&quot;). Bakers often joined the occupation through apprenticeship, or by being born into a family of bakers.

In addition to the secular aspect of baking, Ming bakers also were responsible for providing pastries for use in various rituals, festivals and ceremonies, such as zongzi. In &quot;Shi Fu Meets a Friend at Tanque&quot; buns were provided for the construction ceremony.

Within bakeries, traditional patriarchal hierarchy controlled. For the family-owned bakery, the eldest male figure (usually the father) in the highest position of the hierarchy. For example, in Feng Menglong&#x27;s story, when Mr. Bo went out looking for the family&#x27;s lost silver, his wife was ordered to take care of the bakery.

Ming fiction and art records examples of various bakers; for example, in Feng Menglong&#x27;s story, the Bo couple owns a bakery to sell the cakes and snacks while in &quot;Water Margin&quot;, the character Wu Dalang does not have a settled store and sells pancakes on the shoulder pole along the street The Ming-era painter Qiu Ying&#x27;s work &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; shows food stores alongside the street and peddlers who are selling food along the streets.

The Ming work &quot;Ming Dai Tong Su Ri Yong Lei Shu&quot;, which records techniques and items needed in Ming daily life, devotes a full chapter to culinary skills, including the preparation of pancakes and other types of cakes.

The work &quot;The Plum in the Golden Vase&quot; mentions baozi (steam bun).

===Columbian Exchange===
The Columbian Exchange, which began in 1492, had a profound influence on the baking occupation. Access to sugar greatly increased as a result of new cultivation in the Caribbean, and ingredients such as cocoa and chocolate became available in the Old World. In the eighteenth century, processors learned how to refine sugar from sugar beets, allowing Europeans to grow sugar locally. These developments led to an increase in the sophistication of baking and pastries, and the development of new products such as puff pastries and Danish dough.

===18th century to present===

Two important books on bread-baking were published in the 1770s: Paul-Jacques Malaouin published &quot;L&#x27;art du meinier, du boulanger et du vermicellier&quot; (&quot;The Art of the Miller, the Bread-Baker, and the Pasta-Maker&quot;) in 1775, and Antoine-Augustin Parmentier published &quot;Le parfair boulanger&quot; (&quot;The Perfect Bread-Baker&quot;) in 1778.

A study of the English city of Manchester from 1824–85, during the Industrial Revolution, determined that &quot;baker and shopkeeper&quot; was the third-most common occupation, with 178 male bakers, 19 female bakers, and 8 bakers of unknown sex in the city at that time. This occupation was less common that cloth manufacturer and tavern/public house worker, but more common than cotton spinner, merchant, calico printer, or grocer.

In 1895, the New York State Assembly passed a reformist &quot;bakeshop law&quot; which included protections for bakery workers; the law &quot;banned employees from sleeping in the bakeries; specified the drainage, plumbing and maintenance necessary to keep the bakeries sanitary (cats were specifically allowed to stay on the premise—presumably to deal with the rats); limited the daily and weekly maximum of hours worked; and established an inspectorate to make sure these conditions were met.&quot; The legislation was soon replicated in other states. Joseph Lochner, a bakery owner in Utica, New York, was subsequently convicted of violating the law for forcing his employees to work more than sixty hours a week. He appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided, in the highly influential case of &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905), over a dissent from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, that the labor law violated a constitutional right to &quot;freedom of contract&quot;. This case marked the beginning of a &quot;pro-employer, laissez-faire&quot; era, later known as the &quot;Lochner&quot; era, which &quot;would cast a long shadow over American law, society, and politics&quot; until the late 1930s, when &quot;Lochner&quot; was repudiated. Frustrated with the rapid deterioration of working conditions, bakery workers in New York went on strike in August 1905.

==In religion==
===Christianity===
The first bakeries emerged in Jerusalem, after contact with the Egyptians, from whom the Hebrews learned better manufacturing techniques and obtained the recipe. A short time later, there was already a famous bakers&#x27; street in the city.

The prophet Elisha, then Jesus, performed the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves.

The bread is at the center of the Christian Eucharist; it is &quot;sacramental bread&quot;, &quot;singing bread&quot;, or &quot;angel&#x27;s bread&quot;. Jesus defines himself as &quot;the bread of life&quot; (John 6:35). Divine &quot;grace&quot; is called &quot;the bread of the strong&quot; and preaching, religious teaching, &quot;the bread of the word of God&quot;. In Hebrew, Bethlehem means &quot;house of bread&quot;, and Jesus was born in a city called Bread.

===Roman Catholic patron saints===
In Roman Catholic tradition, the patron saint of bakers and pastry chefs is Honoratus of Amiens (Honoré), a sixth-century bishop of Amiens in northern France for whom the St. Honoré cake is named. Lazarus of Bethany (Lazare) was originally a competitor to Honoré for the title of patron saint of bakers, but in the 17th century the French bakers&#x27; guild settled in favor of Honoré.

==As a surname==

&quot;Baker&quot; is an easily recognizable English surname of medieval occupational origin; &quot;Baxster&quot; is the female form. Equivalent family names of occupational origin meaning &quot;baker&quot; exist in other languages: &quot;Boulanger&quot;, &quot;Bulinger&quot;, &quot;Dufour&quot;, and &quot;Fournier&quot; in French, &quot;Bäcker&quot; in German, and &quot;Piekarz&quot; in Polish.

==Duties and occupational hazards==
According to the &quot;Occupational Outlook Handbook&quot; (&quot;OOH&quot;) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor,

Bakers encounter a number of occupational hazards. &quot;OOH&quot; reports that bakeries, &quot;especially large manufacturing facilities, are filled with potential dangers such as hot ovens, mixing machines, and dough cutters. As a result, bakers have a higher rate of injuries and illnesses than the national average. Although their work is generally safe, bakers may endure back strains caused by lifting or moving heavy bags of flour or other products. Other common risks include cuts, scrapes, and burns. To reduce these risks, bakers often wear back supports, aprons, and gloves.&quot;

Baker&#x27;s asthma—commonly caused by flour allergens and the microbial enzymes (often &quot;Aspergillus&quot;-derived) used to facilitate breadmaking—is one of the common causes of occupational asthma worldwide.

===Comparison with pastry chef===
Both bakers and pastry chefs make desserts and breads. In some restaurants and shops, a single individual serves in both roles. In other environments, there is a distinction between the two positions, with bakers making breads, rolls, and muffins, and pastry chefs making desserts, such as cakes, pies, tarts, and cookies. Even when both bakers and pastry chefs work in the same place, however, there may be overlap.

==Equipment==

A variety of equipment is used by bakers, including:

* Baker&#x27;s peel – A large, flat paddle, either wood or metal, used to slide loaves into and out of an oven
* Rolling pin – A tool used to roll and flatten dough
* Flour scoops – A tool used to add, remove, or measure flour
* Brushes – A tool used to brush off excess flour from dough, and for glazing
* Flour mills – A tool used to mill grains; may be either hand-cranked or mechanical

==Employment statistics==
===United States===
According to the &quot;Occupational Outlook Handbook&quot; published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, there were 185,300 bakers in the U.S. in 2014, with median pay of $23,600 per year or $11.35 per hour. About 28% of U.S. bakers work in stand-alone bakeries or in tortilla manufacturing; 26% work in grocery stores; 15% work in restaurants and other eating places; and 5% were self-employed. About 30% of U.S. bakers worked part-time in 2014.

<doc id="251620" wikidata="Q2588810" url="?curid=251620" title="Culture of Bulgaria">
<text>A number of ancient civilizations, including the Thracians, ancient Greeks, Scythians, Celts, ancient Romans, Goths (Ostrogoths and Visigoths), Slavs (East and West Slavs), Varangians and the Bulgars have left their mark on the culture, history and heritage of Bulgaria. Due to this great variety of influences, Bulgaria has adopted many unusual traditions. Thracian artifacts include numerous temples, tombs, golden treasures and ancient rites and rituals, while the Bulgars have left traces of their heritage in statehood, early architecture, music and dances. Thracian rituals such as the Tryphon Zarezan which is dedicated to Saint Tryphon of Campsada, Kukeri and Martenitsa are to this day kept alive in the modern Bulgarian culture.
The oldest treasure of worked gold in the world, dating back to the 5th millennium BC, comes from the site of the Varna Necropolis.

Bulgaria functioned as a cultural hub of Slavic Europe during much of the Middle Ages, exerting considerable literary and cultural influence over the Eastern Orthodox Slavic world by means of the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools. Bulgaria also gave the world the Cyrillic script, the second most widely used alphabet and sixth most-used writing system in the world, which originated in these two schools in the tenth century.

Bulgaria&#x27;s contribution to humanity continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with individuals such as John Atanasoff — a United States citizen of Bulgarian and British descent, regarded as the father of the digital computer. A number of noted opera-singers (Nicolai Ghiaurov, Boris Christoff, Raina Kabaivanska, Ghena Dimitrova, Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Vesselina Kasarova), pianist Alexis Weissenberg, and successful artists (Christo, Pascin, Vladimir Dimitrov) popularized the culture of Bulgaria abroad.

==Music==
Bulgaria has a long-standing musical tradition dating to the early Middle Ages. One of the earliest known composers of Medieval Europe, Yoan Kukuzel (ca. 1280–1360), became famous for his work &quot;Polieleion of the Bulgarian Woman&quot;. About 90 of his works have survived. Kukuzel also reformed the Byzantine musical writing system, and became known as &quot;The Angel-voiced&quot; for his singing abilities.

The tradition of church singing in Bulgaria is more than thousand years old. In the Bulgarian Orthodox Church there are two traditions of church singing - Eastern monodic (one-voice) singing and choral (polyphonic). The Eastern monodic singing observes the tradition of Greek and Byzantine music as well as the requirements of the eight-voices polyphonic canon of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The second tradition is the choral church music, established during the nineteenth century, when in Bulgaria enters the influence of Russian polyphonic choral church music. Many Bulgarian composers (Dobri Hristov, Petar Dinev, etc.) create their works in the spirit of Russian polyphony. Today Orthodox music is alive and is performed both during church worship services and at concerts by secular choirs and soloists. Contemporary Bulgarian worldwide recognized choirs and singers in whose repertoire permanently takes place the orthodox music are: Yoan Kukuzel Choir, Plovdiv Boys&#x27; Choir &#x27;Stefka Blagoeva&#x27;, Sofia Boys&#x27; Choir, Madrigal Sofia Choir, Sofia Orthodox Choir, Sofia Priest Choir, etc., worldwide famous opera singers Boris Christoff and Nicola Ghiuselev.

The distinctive sound of Bulgarian folk music comes partly from the asymmetric rhythms, harmony and polyphony, such as the use of close intervals like the major second and the singing of a drone accompaniment underneath the melody, especially common in songs from the Shopluk region in Western Bulgaria and the Pirin region.

Bulgarian folk music is unique in its complex harmonies and highly irregular rhythms. These kinds of rhythms, also called &quot;uneven beats&quot; or &quot;asymmetric measures&quot;, were introduced to musicologists only in 1886 when music teacher Anastas Stoyan published Bulgarian folk melodies for the first time. Examples of such beats are , , , and , or composite ones like , and . Each area of Bulgaria has a characteristic music and dance style. Bulgarian folk music inspired and was used by musicians like Kate Bush and George Harrison.

Bulgarian vocal style has a unique throat quality, while the singers themselves are renowned for their range. Their voices are low and soprano and the children love singing as well as anything artistic. Diatonic scales predominate but in the Rhodope Mountains, for example, pentatonic scales occur, while in Thrace chromatic scales with augmented intervals (similar to the music of Classical Greece). Also, the intonation varies, and is quite different from the modern Western equal temperament. Depending on whether the melody moves up or down, an interval can augment or decrease by a quarter tone.

Musical instruments (also characteristic of the whole Balkan region) include &quot;gaida&quot; (bagpipe), &quot;kaval&quot; (rim-blown flute), &quot;zurna&quot; or &quot;zurla&quot; (another woodwind, similar to oboe typical among Roma), &quot;tambura&quot; (long-necked lute), &quot;gadulka&quot; (bowed instrument held upright).

The gaida of Bulgaria is worthy of its own subsection. In Bulgaria the gaida has been a long symbol of the country and its heritage, and is one of the more well-known instruments of the country. The gaida most widely used is the Thracian gaida. There is in the Rhodope Mountains the deep-sounding kaba gaida. In the north, common of Dobrudzha and the Vlachs there is the dzhura gaida. Also in the Strandzha region near the border with Turkey there is the Strandzha gaida. The bag itself is made of a goat skin turned inside out, and most often the rims of the different parts of the instrument - chanter and drone pipe - have a piece of horn on it.

Dances have complex steps matching the rhythms, and are often fast. Most are circle-dances or line dances called &quot;horo&quot;; but some are done singly or in pairs.

Although traditional music and dance are not popular among Bulgarian city youth, they are often performed at weddings, and generally in countryside festivals. They are also performed in Bulgaria and abroad by amateur and professional performing artists and choirs.

Regional folk musical styles abound in Bulgaria. Northern Bulgaria, Dobruja, Shopluk, Thrace, Strandzha, Macedonia and Rhodopes - all have distinctive sounds. Much of traditional folk music revolved around holidays like Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Day, midsummer, and the Feast of St. Lazarus, as well as the Strandzha region&#x27;s unusual Nestinarstvo rites on May 21.

Several world-renowned troupes perform Bulgarian folk music, including the State Ensemble for Folk Songs and Dances, founded by Philip Koutev (1903–1982), Trio Bulgarka and the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir, who are featured, among others, on the anthologies titled &quot;Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares&quot;, volume 2 of which received a Grammy Award in 1989.

One internationally known artist, Valya Balkanska, sang the song &quot;Izlel e Delyu Haydutin&quot;, which was chosen to be part of the Voyager Golden Record selection of music sent into space in the two Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir also known as &quot;Mystery of Bulgarian voices&quot; has also attained a considerable degree of fame.

==Customs and rites==

Bulgarians often give each other a martenitsa () — an adornment made of white and red yarn and worn on the wrist or pinned on the clothes — from March 1 until the end of the month. Alternatively, one can take off the martenitsa earlier if one sees a stork (considered a harbinger of spring). One can then tie the martenitsa to the blossoming branch of a tree. Family-members and friends in Bulgaria customarily exchange martenitsas, which they regard as symbols of health and longevity. The white thread represents peace and tranquility, while the red one stands for the cycles of life. Bulgarians may also refer to the holiday of 1 March as Baba Marta (), meaning &quot;Grandmother March&quot;. It preserves an ancient pagan tradition. Many legends exist regarding the birth of this custom, some of them dating back to the 7th century and the time of Khan Kubrat, the ruler of Old Great Bulgaria. Other tales relate the martenitsa to Thracian and Zoroastrian beliefs. Romania and some parts of Greece also have a similar custom. In 2017, UNESCO added the cultural practices centered around the martenitsa ritual in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

The ancient Bulgarian ritual of kukeri (), performed by costumed men, seeks to scare away evil spirits and bring good harvest and health to the community. The costumes, made of animal furs and fleeces, cover the whole of the body. A mask, adorned with horns and decoration, covers the head of each &quot;kuker&quot;, who also have bells attached to his waist. The kukeri dance, jump and shout in an attempt to banish all evil from the village. Some of the performers impersonate royalty, field-workers and craftsmen. The adornments on the costumes vary from one region to another. In 2015, the ritual was entered in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists as part of the traditional Surva Folk Fest held annually in Pernik.

Another characteristic custom called Nestinarstvo (), or &quot;firedancing&quot;, is found in the Strandzha region. This ancient custom involves dancing into fire or over live embers. Women dance into the fire with their bare feet without suffering any injury or pain. In 2009, the ritual was entered in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

==UNESCO World Heritage Sites==

Bulgaria has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which are part of the national route tourist map of 100 national tourist sites
of the Bulgarian Tourist Union:

*The early medieval large rock relief Madara Rider
*Two Thracian tombs (one in Sveshtari and one in Kazanlak)
*Three monuments of medieval Bulgarian culture (the Boyana Church, the Rila Monastery and the Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo)
*Two examples of natural beauty: the Fisherman Momerioland the Sreburna Nature Reserve
*The ancient city of Nessebur — a unique combination of European cultural interaction, as well as, historically, one of the most important centres of seaborne trade in the Black Sea
*&quot;Surva&quot;- International Kukeri Festival in Pernik, Bulgaria. One of the biggest masquerade festival on the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Conducted in the last three days of January. Kukeri or Surva Festival (Mummer&#x27;s games) in the town of Pernik, is the most spectacular &quot;Kukeri&quot; event in Bulgaria. At the end of January thousands of &quot;kukeri&quot; participants from different regions of Bulgaria, as well as from all around the world gather in Pernik for the three-day event. The festival held in Pernik is the oldest festival of the masquerade games in Bulgaria. The first edition was opened on January 16, 1966. In 1995 the International Federation of Carnival Cities accepted the town of Pernik as its full member. In 2009 Pernik was proclaimed as the European capital of Surva&#x27;s and Mummer&#x27;s. The news that the Kukeri tradition and the Surva Festival in Pernik will be included in UNESCO&#x27;s list of protected non-material cultural heritage, was announced before the inaugural ceremony of the 20th edition of the mummery fest in 2015.

Local archaeologists assume that the number of archaeological sites is the third-largest in Europe after Italy and Greece.

==Theatres==
According to the Bulgarian Statistical Institute as of 2005 there were 75 theatres in Bulgaria including National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria with around 30,000 seats altogether.

The first theatrical events in Bulgaria are related to community centers which were the center of the spiritual and social life of the country in the middle of the 19th century.

The first theatrical production was presented in Shumen in 1856. This is the comedy Mihal Mouseoed by Sava Dobroplodni, who at that time was a teacher in Shumen.

The name of Dobri Voynikov means the beginning of the Bulgarian theater. They call it the father of the Bulgarian drama and theater. According to the fact - an inaccurate definition, because the first dramaturgic work in Bulgaria is the comedy of Theodosius Ikonomov, &quot;The Lovecycle Wanderer or Bella of the hunting poet Sahatchiya&quot;, published in 1863 but compiled as early as 1857. The first theatrical performances on the Bulgarian stage are also not Soldiers. These are the comedy &quot;Mihal&quot;, translated by Greek and adapted for the Bulgarian audience by Sava Dobroplodni, who organized her performance in Shumen, and the dramas &quot;Multitudes Genoveva&quot; and &quot;Belisarius&quot;, placed by Krastyu Pishurka in Lom. All three titles were first played in 1856.

Vazov tells of theater in the 1870s. Until then, dozens of theatrical and pre-theatrical performances have been performed. The first of them began to be organized in the 1940s and 1950s. Even then there are traces of scenographic attempts in our country.

A more important theatrical fact during the Renaissance was the creation of the Svishtov People&#x27;s Theater. The Bulgarian performances in the town began in the 1870s, when the two enthusiastic theaters - Dimitar Shishmanov and Nikolay Pavlovich - returned in their home country. The first is a director, the second is a local theater painter. The Svishtov performances are played on a specially built stage, whose artistic layout is entrusted to N. Pavlovich. And he probably managed to overcome the level of the then Bulgarian theater.

During the period 1900–1917, the Bulgarian theater entered a new stage of its development - a stage of real professionalisation of the acting art, the Europeanization of the appearance of the spectacle and the permanent establishment of the National Theater as a nationally representative cultural institution.

The Bulgarian Theater in the years to 1989 has ideological-party orientation. It is in the service of socialist realism.

The arts are called &quot;the means of education&quot;, and &quot;socialist realism - the only method of artistic creativity&quot;. Changes in society, culture, the arts, the theater are ubiquitous. The imposition of socialist realism takes place through the repertoire, the new Bulgarian drama, as well as the staging practice.

The dynamic development of the Bulgarian theater after 1989 typifies theater phenomena for a long period of nearly 25 years and highlights by them trends, essential characteristics and innovative movements.

Famous Bulgarian theatrical actors are: Georgi Kaloyanchev, Stoyanka Mutafova, Roza Popova, Vasil Gendov, Georgi Partsalev, Velko Kanev, Pavel Poppandov, Maria Sapundjieva, Iossif Surchadzhiev and others.

Famous Bulgarian playwrights include: Peyo Yavorov, Nedyalko Yordanov, Stoslav Stratiev, Rangel Ignatov and others.

==Visual art==

Bulgaria has a rich heritage in the visual arts, especially in frescoes, murals and icons. The Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak offers fine examples of excellently preserved ancient Thracian art. Tomb art provides one of the most important sources of information about Thracian lifestyle and culture. Visual arts in the Bulgarian lands experienced an upsurge during the entire period of the Middle Ages. The crypt of the Alexander Nevski cathedral features an exhibition of a large collection of medieval icons. The earliest of those dates from around the 9th century. The Tarnovo Artistic School, the mainstream of the Bulgarian fine arts and architecture between 13th and 14th centuries, takes its name from the capital and main cultural center of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Tarnovo. Although it shows the influence of some tendencies of the Palaeologan Renaissance in the Byzantine Empire, the Tarnovo painting had its own unique features which makes it a separate artistic school.
Art historians classify its products into two types:

*mural painting: mural decoration of churches
*iconography: easel painting
The works of the school show some degree of realism, portrait individualism and psychology.

The unique and realistic portraits in the Boyana Church class as forerunners of the Renaissance.

The wall piers and the arches often featured medallion-shaped bust images of saints. Magnificent examples of those survive in Church of Saints Peter and Paul Church in Tarnovo. Along with traditional scenes such as &quot;Christ&#x27;s passions&quot; and &quot;Feast cycle&quot; in the second layer; &quot;Christ Pantokrator&quot; in the dome and the Madonna with the infant Christ in the apse, specific images and scenes also appear. During the period of Ottoman rule (1396–1878) the authorities suppressed Bulgarian art. Many churches suffered destruction, and newly built ones remained somewhat modest. In the end of the 18th century the Islamic Ottoman Empire began to decay slowly, thus permitting the Bulgarian National Revival of the 18th and 19th centuries to occur. Bulgaria experienced a revival in every area of culture. Following the Liberation in 1878, fine arts rapidly recovered and came under the influence of European artistic currents such as late Romanticism.

After 1878 until the middle of the 20th century, there was an extremely intensive process of incorporating the Bulgarian art into the contemporary European artistic culture. The development of Bulgarian art follows the path of the ethnographic and descriptive genre scenes, painted by the artists after the Liberation, such as Ivan Markvichka, Anton Mitov, Ivan Angelov, Yaroslav Veshin in the exquisite landscapes and elegant portraits typical of the beginning of the 20th century by Nikola Petrov, Nikola Marinov, Stefan Ivanov, Elena Karamihailova together with the expressive decoration of the 1920s (Ivan Milev, Ivan Penkov, Pencho Georgiev ... ) to the extremely wealthy creative talents and various plastic quests in the 1930s and 1940s by Vladimir Dimitrov - The Master, Zlatyu Boyadzhiev, Dechko Uzunov, Nenko Balkanski, Sirak Skitnik, Vera Nedkova, Ivan Nenov, Bencho Obreshkov, with many different artists from different parts of the country.

The cartoon, the illustration and the layout of the book with the three great ones first appear as they are called Alexander Bozhinov, Ilia Beshkov, Raiko Aleksiev, Kiril Buyukliiski, Alexander Zhendov, Stoyan Venev, Sirak Skitnik. The Bulgarian sculpture is also developing: Boris Shaz and Zheko Spiridonov, Andrey Nikolov and Ivan Lazarov, Lyubomir Dalchev, Vaska Emanouilova, Marko Markov, Ivan Funev give it its foundation. But the development of Bulgarian art continues to develop vigorously and independently in our time also.

==Cuisine==

The relatively warm climate and diverse geography afford excellent growing conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits, Bulgarian cuisine (, &quot;bulgarska kuhnya&quot;) offers great diversity.

Famous for its rich salads required at every meal, Bulgarian cuisine also features diverse quality dairy products and a variety of wines and local alcoholic drinks such as rakia (), mastika () and menta (). Bulgarian cuisine also features a variety of hot and cold soups, for example tarator. Many different Bulgarian pastries exist as well, such as banitsa, a traditional pastry prepared by layering a mixture of whisked eggs and pieces of Bulgarian cheese with filo pastry and then baking it in an oven.

Traditionally, Bulgarian cooks put lucky charms into their pastry on certain occasions, particularly on Christmas Eve, the first day of Christmas, or New Year&#x27;s Eve. Such charms may include coins or small symbolic objects (such as a small piece of a dogwood branch with a bud, symbolizing health or longevity). , people have started writing happy wishes on small pieces of paper and wrapping them in tin foil. Messages may include wishes for happiness, health, long life or success throughout the new year.

Bulgarians eat banitsa — hot or cold — for breakfast with plain yogurt, ayran, or boza. Some varieties include banitsa with spinach (, &quot;spanachena banitsa&quot;) or the sweet version, banitsa with milk (, &quot;mlechna banitsa&quot;) or pumpkin (, &quot;tikvenik&quot;).

The Bulgarian lyutenitsa () is a spicy mixture of mashed and cooked tomatoes, aubergines, garlic, hot peppers and vegetable oil, seasoned with salt, pepper and parsley. Variations of lyutenitsa exist in the national cuisines of most Balkan states.

Tripe soup (, &quot;skhembe chorba&quot;) takes as its basis the thick lining of the cleaned stomach of cattle, prepared with milk and seasoned with vinegar, garlic and hot peppers. Under Ottoman rule, the sultans allegedly preferred tripe soup made by Bulgarian cooks, whose mastery in preparing the dish remained unmatched in the Balkans. In addition, Bulgaria is included in the Michelin catalog because of its rich cuisine and traditional dishes.
Exports of Bulgarian wine go worldwide; and until 1990 the country exported the world&#x27;s second-largest total of bottled wine. The rich soil, perfect climate and the millennia-old tradition of wine-making, which dates back to the time of the Thracians, contribute to the wide variety of fine Bulgarian wines. As of 2007, Bulgaria produced 200,000 tonnes of wine annually, ranking 20th in the world.

==Media==

Bulgaria&#x27;s media are generally deemed unbiased, although the state still dominates the field through the Bulgarian National Television (BNT), the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR), and the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. Bulgarian media have a record of unbiased reporting, although they are deemed potentially at risk of political influence due to the lack of legislation to protect them. The written media have no legal restrictions and newspaper publishing is entirely liberal. The extensive freedom of the press means that no exact number of publications can be established, although some research put an estimate of around 900 print media outlets for 2006. The largest-circulation daily newspapers include &quot;Dneven Trud&quot; and &quot;24 Chasa&quot;.

Non-printed media sources, such as television and radio, are overseen by the Council for Electronic Media (CEM), an independent body with the authority to issue broadcasting licenses. Apart from a state-operated national television channel, radio station and the Bulgarian News Agency, a large number of private television and radio stations exist. However, most Bulgarian media experience a number of negative trends, such as general degradation of media products, self-censorship and economic or political pressure. &quot;Slavi&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;Gospodari Na Efira&quot; are among the most popular TV programs, both having more than 1,000,000 views per show.

Internet media are growing in popularity due to the wide range of available opinions and viewpoints, lack of censorship and diverse content.

==Religion==
Bulgaria is officially a secular nation and the Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion but designates Orthodoxy as a &quot;traditional&quot; religion. In the 2001 census, 82.6% Bulgarians declared themselves Orthodox Christians, 12.2% Muslim, 1.2% other Christian denominations, 4% other religions (Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Judaism) and zero percent atheists. Most citizens of Bulgaria have associations — at least nominally — with the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Founded in 870 AD under the Patriarchate of Constantinople (from which it obtained its first primate, its clergy and theological texts), the Bulgarian Orthodox Church had autocephalous status since 927 AD. The Church became subordinate within the Patriarchate of Constantinople, twice during the periods of Byzantine (1018 – 1185) and Ottoman (1396 – 1878) domination. It was re-established first in 1870 in the form of the Bulgarian Exarchate, and then in the 1950s as the Bulgarian Patriarchate.

Islam came to Bulgaria at the end of the fourteenth century after the conquest of the country by the Ottomans. It gradually gained ground throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries through the introduction of Turkish colonists. One Islamic sect, Ahmadiyya, faces problems in Bulgaria. Some officials have moved against Ahmadis
on the grounds that other countries also attack the religious rights of Ahmadis, who many Muslims regard as heretical.

In the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries, missionaries from Rome converted Bulgarian Paulicians in the districts of Plovdiv and Svishtov to Roman Catholicism. their descendants form the bulk of Bulgarian Catholics, whose number stood at 44,000 in 2001.
Missionaries from the United States introduced Protestantism into Bulgarian territory in 1857. Missionary work continued throughout the second half of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century. In 2001 Bulgaria had some 42,000 Protestants.

Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism became popular among Bulgarians in the time of perestroika and especially after the fall of communist regime and are usually a co-religion or co-belief to Bulgarians who otherwise are Christians (Roman Catholicism or Orthodoxy). Among these Eastern (Asian) religions Buddhist centres are officially registered in Bulgaria as religious denominations. The number of followers of Buddhism has increased gradually in recent years also due to the influx of Vietnamese citizens (predominantly Buddhist) to Bulgaria.

According to the most recent Eurostat &quot;Eurobarometer&quot; poll, in 2005,
40% of Bulgarian citizens responded that &quot;they believe there is a God&quot;, whereas 40% answered that &quot;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot;, 13% that &quot;they do not believe there is a God, spirit, nor life force&quot;, and 6% did not answer.

==Clothing==
Bulgarian traditional clothing is diverse, and every ethnographic area in Bulgaria has its distinct styles. 
Bulgarians call their traditional clothing &#x27;носия&#x27; (nosiya).

<doc id="251626" wikidata="Q334015" url="?curid=251626" title="Winnie Ewing">
<text>Winifred Margaret Ewing (; 10 July 1929 – 21 June 2023) was a Scottish lawyer and politician who figured prominently in the Scottish National Party.

Born and raised in Glasgow, Ewing studied law at the University of Glasgow, where she joined the university&#x27;s Scottish Nationalist Association. After graduating, she worked as a lawyer, serving as secretary of the Glasgow Bar Association from 1962 to 1967. Ewing was elected to the House of Commons in the 1967 Hamilton by-election and her presence at Westminster led to a rise in membership for the SNP. Although she lost her seat in the 1970 election, she was re-elected in February 1974, this time for the Moray and Nairn constituency. Ewing lost her seat in the 1979 election and, after making numerous attempts to seek re-election, failed to do so.

Ewing was elected to the European Parliament in the 1979 elections, representing the Highlands and Islands. In Europe, she acquired the nickname &quot;Madame Écosse&quot; because of her advocacy of Scottish interests. In 1987, she became the president of the Scottish National Party. She served as vice president of the European Radical Alliance and by 1995 had become Britain&#x27;s longest serving MEP. In the first elections to the Scottish Parliament, she was elected to represent the Highlands and Islands. As the oldest qualified member, it was her duty to preside over the opening of the Scottish Parliament.

==Early life==
Ewing was born Winifred Margaret Woodburn on 10 July 1929 in Glasgow, to Christina Bell Anderson and George Woodburn, a small business owner. She was educated at Battlefield School and Queen&#x27;s Park Secondary School. In 1946 she matriculated at the University of Glasgow where she graduated with an MA and LLB. Although relatively inactive in politics at that time, she joined the Student Nationalists. Following her graduation, she qualified and practised as a solicitor and notary public. She was Secretary of the Glasgow Bar Association from 1962 to 1967.

== Political career ==

Ewing became active in campaigning for Scottish independence through her membership of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association, and won the 1967 Hamilton by-election as the Scottish National Party (SNP) candidate. She was elected with the help of a team including her election agent, John McAteer. On 16 November, she made her first appearance at Westminster, with her husband and children accompanying her on the journey. She arrived at the parliament in a Scottish-built Hillman Imp and was greeted by a crowd and a pipe band.

Ewing said at the time &quot;stop the world, Scotland wants to get on&quot;, and her presence at Westminster led to a rise in membership for the SNP. It was speculated that Ewing&#x27;s electoral gain led to the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission by the Labour government of Harold Wilson to look into the viability of a devolved Scottish Assembly. In hindsight it could be said to mark the start of modern politics in Scotland, according to Professor Richard Finlay of Strathclyde University, bringing young people and women from non-political backgrounds into politics for the first time, whilst Labour and Tory party organisation and branch numbers were declining.

Despite her high profile, Ewing was unsuccessful in retaining the Hamilton seat at the 1970 general election. At the following February 1974 election she stood for Moray and Nairn and was returned to Westminster, although another election followed in October of the same year when her already marginal majority declined. Following the October election she was announced as the SNP&#x27;s spokesperson on external affairs and the EEC. She first became an MEP in 1975, at a time when the European Parliament was still composed of representative delegations from national parliaments. She lost her Westminster seat at the May 1979 election, but within weeks had gained a seat in the European Parliament at the first direct elections to the Parliament. Ewing was unsuccessful at seeking to return to Westminster as the SNP candidate for Orkney and Shetland in 1983, coming third.
Ewing was elected the SNP Party President in 1987. It was during her time as an MEP that she acquired the nickname (French for &#x27;Mrs Scotland&#x27;) because of her advocacy of Scottish interests in Strasbourg and Brussels. That sobriquet was first used by &quot;Le Monde&quot; and with Ewing using the term as a badge of pride, it stuck. By 1995 she had become Britain&#x27;s longest serving MEP. She served as Vice President of the European Radical Alliance, which in addition to the SNP also included French, Belgian, Italian and Spanish MEPs.

In 1999, she did not stand for the European Parliament, instead becoming a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) in the first session of the Scottish Parliament, representing the Highlands and Islands. As the oldest qualified member, it was her duty to preside over the opening of the Scottish Parliament, a session she opened with the statement: &quot;The Scottish Parliament, adjourned on the 25th day of March in the year 1707, is hereby reconvened&quot;. She sat as a member on the European Committee and the Public Petitions Committee.
During the controversy that arose in the early years of the Scottish Parliament surrounding proposals to repeal Clause 28 (a law banning the active promotion of homosexuality in schools), she joined her son Fergus Ewing in abstaining, although her daughter in law Margaret Ewing supported repeal as did the majority of her party&#x27;s MSPs. In June 2001, having turned 72 years old, she announced that she would retire from Parliament at the end of the session. In January 2003, her husband, Stewart Ewing, died from a heart attack after a fire at their home. He had been active with her in politics for many years, and had himself served as an SNP councillor for the Summerston area in Glasgow, gaining the seat of Dick Dynes, the leader of the Labour Group on Glasgow District Council in 1977, a result described by &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; as &quot;an absolute sensation&quot;. Later in 2003 she stood down from being an MSP, although she continued to serve as the SNP&#x27;s President. On 15 July 2005, she announced she would be stepping down as President of the Scottish National Party at its September Conference, bringing to an end her 38-year career in representative politics.

Nicola Sturgeon said that Ewing had given her &quot;hugely valuable advice&quot; on public speaking, and that Ewing had given her some important advice as a young woman in politics, namely &quot;Stand your ground and believe in yourself&quot; and &quot;a more vibrant, colourful, dynamic, passionate, committed person, you would struggle to meet.&quot;

==Outside Parliament==
Ewing was a vice president of equal rights charity Parity. In April 2009, BBC Alba broadcast a biographical documentary &quot;Madame Ecosse&quot;, produced by Madmac Productions. It was rebroadcast on BBC Scotland to mark her 80th birthday. Nicola Sturgeon named Ewing as her Political Hero on BBC News in 2018.

==Personal life==

Winnie and Stuart Ewing had three children, two of whom also went on to a career in politics: their son, Fergus Ewing, was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and went on to hold several cabinet posts. Their daughter, Annabelle Ewing, was an MP from 2001 to 2005 and was elected an MSP in 2006. Ewing died at her home in Bridge of Weir on 21 June 2023, at age 93.

==Awards and honours==
In 1990 she was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 2003 the Law Society of Scotland made her an honorary member. She was awarded honorary LLD degrees from the University of Glasgow in 1995 and the University of Aberdeen in 2004. She was awarded Doctor of the University degrees from the Open University in 1993 and the University of Stirling in 2012. In 2009, a portrait of her painted by David Donaldson in 1970 was lent to the Scottish Parliament and put on display.

<text>Gerard Hendrik (Geert) Hofstede (2 October 1928 – 12 February 2020) was a Dutch social psychologist, IBM employee, and Professor Emeritus of Organizational Anthropology and International Management at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, well known for his pioneering research on cross-cultural groups and organizations.

He is best known for developing one of the earliest and most popular frameworks for measuring cultural dimensions in a global perspective. Here he described national cultures along six dimensions: Power Distance, Individualism, Uncertainty avoidance, Masculinity, Long Term Orientation, and Indulgence vs. restraint. He was known for his books &quot;Culture&#x27;s Consequences&quot; and &quot;Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind&quot;, co-authored with his son Gert Jan Hofstede. The latter book deals with organizational culture, which is a different structure from national culture, but also has measurable dimensions, and the same research methodology is used for both.

== Biography ==
Born to Gerrit and Evertine Geessine (Veenhoven) Hofstede, Geert Hofstede attended schools in The Hague and Apeldoorn, and received his high school diploma (Gymnasium Beta) in 1945. In 1953, Hofstede graduated from Delft Technical University with an MSc in Mechanical Engineering. After working in the industry for ten years, Hofstede entered part-time doctoral study at Groningen University in The Netherlands, and received his PhD in social psychology cum laude in 1967. His thesis was titled &quot;The Game of Budget Control&quot;.

Upon his graduation from Delft in 1953, Hofstede joined the Dutch military, working as a technical officer in the Dutch army for two years. After leaving the military he worked in industry from 1955 to 1965, starting as a factory hand in Amsterdam. In 1965 he started his graduate study in Groningen and joined IBM International, working as a management trainer and manager of personnel research. He founded and managed the Personnel Research Department. During a two-year sabbatical from IBM from 1971 to 1973 he was a visiting lecturer at IMEDE (now the International Institute for Management Development). In 1980, Hofstede co-founded and became the first Director for the IRIC, the Institute for Research on Intercultural Cooperation, located at Tilburg University since 1998.

Since his retirement in 1993, Hofstede visited numerous universities worldwide to educate students on his theoretical approaches and to continue his research in this field. He was Professor Emeritus of Organizational Anthropology and International Management at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, and served as an extramural fellow of the Center of Economic Research at Tilburg University in Tilburg, Netherlands.

Hofstede received many honorary awards, and in 2011 was made a Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion (Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw). He held honorary doctorates from seven universities in Europe, Nyenrode Business University, New Bulgarian University, Athens University of Economics and Business, University of Gothenburg, University of Liège, ISM University of Management and Economics, University of Pécs in 2009, and University of Tartu in 2012. He also received honorary professorships at The University of Hong Kong 1992–2000; the Beijing University of International Business and Economics (UIBE), Beijing, China; and the Renmin University of China, Beijing, China.

In 1955, Hofstede married Maaike A. van den Hoek. Together, they had four sons: Gert-Jan Hofstede, who is a population biologist and social scientist in information management; Rokus Hofstede, who works as a translator; Bart Hofstede, a Cultural Counselor for the Kingdom of the Netherlands who has served in Berlin, Paris and is now serving in Beijing, and Gideon Hofstede, who works as an international marketeer. He also had ten grandchildren. Gert-Jan has worked extensively with his father and co-authored several works in the realm of culture study.

In 2014, a movie was released about Hofstede&#x27;s life and work, &quot;An Engineer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;.

In 2016, he received his 9th honorary doctorate in Prague, at the age of 88. He died on February 12, 2020.

== Work ==
Hofstede was a researcher in the fields of organizational studies and more concretely organizational culture, also cultural economics and management. He was a well-known pioneer in his research of cross-cultural groups and organizations and played a major role in developing a systematic framework for assessing and differentiating national cultures and organizational cultures. His studies demonstrated that there are national and regional cultural groups that influence the behavior of societies and organizations.

=== Early inspiration ===
When World War II ended, Geert Hofstede was seventeen and had always lived in the Netherlands under rather difficult circumstances, so he decided that it was time for him to explore the world. He entered technical college in 1945, and had one year of internships, including a voyage to Indonesia in 1947 as an assistant ship&#x27;s engineer with abbott Olivier Perbet. It was his first time out of his country and being immersed in a foreign culture, and it was an early influence in his career to study cross-cultures. He was also influenced by a trip he made to England after meeting an English girl introduced to him by a friend of his family Alain Meiar, where he experienced culture shock. He was struck by the cultural differences that he noticed between England and the Netherlands, two very close European countries. These early experiences helped translate into a lifelong career in cross-cultural research.

A second important period in his life was working in industry between 1955 and 1965, when he held professional and managerial jobs in three different Dutch industrial companies. By experiencing management, he had a chance to see the organization from the bottom up working as a mechanic. This training and background as an engineer shaped his research and his approach to social situations. He claims that his description of social situations appeals to a number of people: &quot;I still have the mind of an engineer to the extent that I try to be specific...and be clear about what I am saying&quot;. That was important in his development of quantifying cultures on different dimensions.

=== IBM research ===
At IBM International, Hofstede started working as a management trainer and manager of personnel research, and founded and managed the Personnel Research Department. This was his transition from the field of engineering and into psychology. In this role, he played an active role in the introduction and application of employee opinion surveys in over 70 national subsidiaries of IBM around the world. He traveled across Europe and the Middle East to interview people and conduct surveys regarding people&#x27;s behavior in large organizations and how they collaborated. He collected large amounts of data, but the pressures of his daily job made him unable to conduct a significant amount of research. When he took a two-year sabbatical from IBM in 1971, he delved deeper into the data he had collected from his job and discovered that there were significant differences between cultures in other organizations but got the same ranking of answers by country. At the time, the results of the IBM&#x27;s surveys, with over 100,000 questionnaires, were one of the largest cross-national databases in existence.

He became a visiting lecturer at IMEDE (now the International Institute for Management Development) in Lausanne, Switzerland. At IMEDE, he administered a selection of IBM questionnaire items to his course participants, who were international managers from over 30 countries and from a variety of different private and public organizations unrelated to IBM. Hofstede found that the same results that he discovered in the IBM surveys had reproduced themselves significantly in the sample of his students. This was the first hard piece of evidence that the differences among countries was not specific to IBM, but, instead, were due to a generalized set of shared socialization skills that were specific to people having grown up in the same country, and not necessarily the same organization.

Hofstede rejoined IBM and informed it of the enormous database that IBM had at its disposal and wanted to create a research project to continue this new way of examining the data. After a lack of opportunity to conduct his research at IBM, he found two part-time jobs, including one at the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Brussels as a Professor of Management, while simultaneously teaching part-time at INSEAD business school in Fontainebleau, France. Between 1973 and 1979, he worked on the data, and analyzed it in a variety of ways. He used existing literature in psychology, sociology, political science, and anthropology to relate his findings in a larger scope of study. In 1980, he published his book &quot;Culture&#x27;s Consequences&quot;, where the results of his analysis were presented.

=== Research on national cultures and critiques ===

==== Research on national cultures ====
Hofstede&#x27;s analysis defined four initial dimensions of national culture that were positioned against analysis of 40 initial countries. As a trained psychologist, he began his analysis of the survey data he had collected at IBM at the individual respondent level. At the end of two years, he realized he needed an &quot;ecological&quot; analysis, in which respondents were contextualized by their countries. By aggregating individuals as societal units, he could examine national cultures rather than individual personalities.

Hofstede&#x27;s model explaining national cultural differences and their consequences, when introduced in 1980, came at a time when cultural differences between societies had become increasingly relevant for both economic and political reasons. The analysis of his survey data and his claims led many management practitioners to embrace the model, especially after the publication of his 1991 book, &quot;Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind&quot;.

In 1980, Hofstede co-founded and became the first Director for the IRIC, the Institute for Research on Intercultural Cooperation, located at Tilburg University since 1998. Much of Hofstede&#x27;s research on the basic dimensions of nations came through the IRIC. In 2001, Hofstede published an entirely re-written second edition of &quot;Culture&#x27;s Consequences&quot;. In 2010, a third edition of &quot;Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind&quot; was published with Gert Jan Hofstede, Michael H. Bond and as co-authors. In this book, there were two new dimensions that were added, and the number of countries covered was between 76 and 93. This book also introduced the topic of organizational cultures as a separate and different phenomenon.

==== Critiques ====

Despite the popularity of Hofstede&#x27;s model, some critics have argued that his conceptualization of culture and its impact on people&#x27;s behavior might be incorrect. The most cited criticism of his work is by Professor Brendan McSweeney (Royal Holloway, University of London and Stockholm University), who argues that Hofstede&#x27;s claims about the role of national culture indicates too much determinism that might be linked to fundamental flaws in his methodology. Hofstede replied to this critique, arguing that the second edition of his book had responded to many of McSweeney&#x27;s concerns and that he viewed the resistance to his ideas as a sign that he was shifting the prevalent paradigm in cross-cultural studies. McSweeney has rejected Hofstede&#x27;s reply, arguing that the same profound methodological flaws that characterize the original analysis of the IBM data remain in the second edition.

Another key critique, which largely focuses on level of analysis, is by Professor Barry Gerhart (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Professor Meiyu Fang (National Central University, Taiwan), who point out that among other problems with Hofstede&#x27;s research (and the way it is widely interpreted) is that his results actually only show that around 2 to 4 percent of variance in individual values is explained by national differences – in other words 96 percent, and perhaps more, is not explained. And that there is nothing in Hofstede&#x27;s work that pertains to individual-level behaviours or actions.

In a 2008 article in the Academy of Management&#x27;s journal, The Academy of Management Review, Galit Ailon deconstructs &quot;Culture&#x27;s Consequences&quot; by mirroring it against its own assumptions and logic. Ailon finds several inconsistencies at the level of both theory and methodology, and cautions against an uncritical reading of Hofstede&#x27;s cultural dimensions.

Philippe d&#x27;Iribarne, director of research at the CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) in Paris expressed concern that &quot;a theory of culture that considers culture to be &#x27;shared meaning&#x27; does not allow for representation of the forms of unity and continuity.&quot; Part of d&#x27;Iribarne&#x27;s objections have been with the weaknesses of Hofstede&#x27;s terminology in general and category names specifically (e.g., power distance as a culture as whole versus a culture&#x27;s acceptance of hierarchy only within organizational settings). More pointedly, d&#x27;Iribarne questions the generalized conclusions that Hofstede draws from the data, imposing Hofstede&#x27;s own value system on what the data show. For instance, d&#x27;Iribarne questioned Hofstede&#x27;s conclusions from the uncertainty avoidance statistics, arguing that Hofstede superimposes his own view that data. For d&#x27;Iribarne, Hostede simply presumes that showing high stress at work correlates with weak uncertainty avoidance, while d&#x27;Iribarne asserts that the presence of high stress could just as readily indicate high stress results from high uncertainty avoidance, since no external control exists in low uncertainty avoidance cultures. Finally, d&#x27;Iribarne questions Hofstede&#x27;s implicit assumption of uniformity in complex organizations, let alone entire national cultures. Such assumptions of uniformity are useful, d&#x27;Iribarne writes only &quot;if one thinks of a culture specific to a close-knit community.&quot; Instead, though, d&#x27;Iribarne notes that in most situations, &quot;society is split into more or less antagonistic groups&quot; and in any case, &quot;meaning is not only received but produced&quot;; in short, Hofstede does not allow for the fact that people do not remain static in how they interact with one another. Philippe d&#x27;Iribarne fills out the bare bones of Hofstede&#x27;s simplified structure, a point with which Hofstede himself acknowledged when he wrote that, &quot;The two approaches are complementary -- mine is more quantitative, d&#x27;Iribarne&#x27;s more qualitative. I provided a skeleton for the countries he studied, and he provided the flesh. The skeleton I proposed is a worldwide structure in cultural differences among cultures.&quot;

Other academics also point to a fundamental flaw in the common application of Hofstede&#x27;s culture dimensions. Hofstede&#x27;s culture dimensions and scores are national or &quot;ecological&quot; in nature and do not apply to &quot;individual&quot; people living in the sampled countries: In Hofstede&#x27;s analysis, the correlations of his culture variables are significant when aggregated to the national level but not significant at the individual level. This means that no cultural implications can be drawn about individual people living in a certain country; to do so is to commit an “ecological fallacy”. To avoid this fallacy and resulting confusion Brewer and Venaik recommend avoiding the use of the Hofstede dimension scores in management research and training. The same authors compare the Hofstede culture dimension scores with equivalent dimension scores from the GLOBE culture model and show severe problems in face, discriminant and convergent validity across the two models.

In a re-analysis of the cross-national value data, based on Hofstede, Shalom Schwartz and Ronald Inglehart and his own factor analysis of recent World Values Survey data, (Corvinus University of Budapest) found however a large-scale confirmation of Hofstede&#x27;s value scales with other value survey research results. Especially the dimensions Power Distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Long-Term Orientation and Indulgence versus Restraint are closely correlated with value dimensions reported by Inglehart, Schwartz and the current data from the World Values Survey.

=== Reception of his work ===

Hofstede&#x27;s books have appeared in 23 languages. His publications have been cited several ten thousand times, which makes him one of the currently most cited European social scientist.

He received much recognition for his work in cross-cultural analysis. In 2004, the Hanze University Groningen, the Netherlands established the Geert Hofstede Lecture, a bi-annual conference in the area of intercultural communication. In 2006, Maastricht University, the Netherlands inaugurated a Geert Hofstede Chair in cultural diversity.

In 2008, six European universities united to create the Master in International Communication (MIC), and named themselves the Geert Hofstede Consortium.

In 2009, Reputation Institute, which &quot;recognizes individuals who have greatly contributed to the field of reputation through both scholarship and practice&quot;, nominated Hofstede as the Best Scholar of the year.

In October 2010, Maastricht University School of Business and Economics launched the Geert Hofstede Fund, aiming at encouraging activities around multicultural interactions and research about the impact of cultural differences.

<text>Earth materials include minerals, rocks, soil and water. These are the naturally occurring materials found on Earth that constitute the raw materials upon which our global society exists. Earth materials are vital resources that provide the basic components for life, agriculture and industry.




==Definitions==

The type of materials available locally will of course vary depending upon the conditions in the area of the building site. Take considerations of what is explained below.

In many areas, indigenous stone is available from the local region, such as limestone, marble, granite, and sandstone. It may be cut in quarries or removed from the surface of the ground (flag and fieldstone). Ideally, stone from the building site can be utilized. Depending on the stone type, it can be used for structural block, facing block, pavers, and crushed stone.

Most brick plants are located near the clay source they use to make brick. Bricks are molded and baked blocks of clay. Brick products come in many forms, including structural brick, face brick, roof tile, structural tile, paving brick, and floor tile.

Caliche is a soft limestone material which is mined from areas with calcium-carbonate soils and limestone bedrock. It is best known as a road bed material, but it can be processed into an unfired building block, stabilized with an additive such as cement. Other earth materials include soil blocks typically stabilized with a cement additive and produced with forms or compression.

Rammed Earth consists of walls made from moist, sandy soil, or stabilized soil, which is tamped into form work. Walls are a minimum of 12″ thick. Soils should contain about 30% clay and 70% sand.
==Considerations==

The use of locally available and indigenous earth materials has several advantages in terms of sustainability. They are:

Reduction of energy costs related to transportation.
Reduction of material costs due to reduced transportation costs, especially for well-established industries.
Support of local businesses and resource bases.
Care must be taken to ensure that non-renewable earth materials are not over-extracted. Ecological balance within the region needs to be maintained while efficiently utilizing its resources. Many local suppliers carry materials that have been shipped in from out of the area, so it is important to ask for locally produced/quarried materials.

Both brick and stone materials are aesthetically pleasing, durable, and low maintenance. Exterior walls weather well, eliminating the need for constant refinishing and sealing. Interior use of brick and stone can also provide excellent thermal mass, or be used to provide radiant heat. Some stone and brick makes an ideal flooring or exterior paving material, cool in summer and possessing good thermal properties for passive solar heating. Caliche block has been produced for applications similar to stone and brick mentioned above. Caliche or earth material block has special structural and finishing characteristics.

Rammed earth is more often considered for use in walls, although it can also be used for floors. Rammed earth and caliche block can be used for structural walls, and offer great potential as low-cost material alternatives with low embodied energy. In addition, such materials are fireproof.

Caliche block and rammed earth can be produced on-site. It is very important to have soils tested for construction material use. Some soils, such as highly expansive or bentonite soils, are not suitable for structural use. Testing labs are available in most areas to determine material suitability for structural use and meeting codes.

Soils for traditional adobe construction are not found in some areas, but other soils for earth building options are available. Many areas have a high percentage of soils suitable for ramming.
(Official areas are approximately 19,610 acres in the Austin, TX area, according to the US. Department of Agriculture).

Caliche is also abundant in many areas (covering 14% of the Austin geographic area, for instance) and is readily available locally.

<text>Alfonsus (Fons) Trompenaars (born 1953, Amsterdam) is a Dutch
organizational theorist, management consultant, and author in the field of ethics. known for the development of Trompenaars&#x27; model of national culture differences and Dilemma Theory.

== Biography ==
In 1979, Trompenaars received his MA in economics at the Vrije Universiteit and in 1983 his PhD from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for the thesis &quot;The Organization of Meaning and the Meaning of Organization&quot;.

In 1981 Trompenaars started his career at the Royal Dutch Shell Personnel Division, working on job classification and management development. In 1989 together with Charles Hampden-Turner he founded and directed the consultancy firm &quot;Centre for International Business Studies&quot;, working for such companies as BP, Philips, IBM, Heineken, AMD, Mars, Motorola, General Motors, Merrill Lynch, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, ABN AMRO, ING, PepsiCo, Honeywell. In 1998 the company was bought by KPMG and renamed &quot;Trompenaars Hampden-Turner&quot;.

Trompenaars was awarded the International Professional Practice Area Research Award by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) in 1991.

=== Trompenaars&#x27; model of national culture differences ===
Trompenaars&#x27; model of national culture differences is a framework for cross-cultural communication applied to general business and management, developed by Trompenaars and Charles Hampden-Turner. This model of national culture differences has seven dimensions.
# Universalism vs. particularism (&quot;What is more important, rules or relationships?&quot;) 
# Individualism vs. collectivism (communitarianism) (&quot;Do we function in a group or as individuals?&quot;)
# Neutral vs. emotional (&quot;Do we display our emotions?&quot;) 
# Specific vs. diffuse (&quot;How separate we keep our private and working lives&quot;)
# Achievement vs. ascription (&quot;Do we have to prove ourselves to receive status or is it given to us?&quot;)
# Sequential vs. synchronic (&quot;Do we do things one at a time or several things at once?&quot;) 
# Internal vs. external control (&quot;Do we control our environment or are we controlled by it?&quot;) 
There are five orientations covering the ways in which human beings deal with each other.

=== Trompenaars Hampden-Turner Dilemma Thinking ===

Source:

Dilemma theory, as proposed by Fons Trompenaars and Charles Hampden-Turner, is a framework for understanding and managing cultural differences in organizations. Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner suggest that cultural diversity often leads to dilemmas or tensions between conflicting cultural values. These dilemmas can arise in various areas such as communication, decision-making, leadership, and teamwork.

The key premise of dilemma theory is that these cultural dilemmas are not problems to be solved but rather paradoxes to be managed. Instead of trying to eliminate one side of the dilemma in favor of the other, individuals and organizations must learn to navigate the tensions between conflicting values.

<text>The Rammelsberg is a mountain, high, on the northern edge of the Harz range, south of the historic town of Goslar in the North German state of Lower Saxony. The mountain is the location of an important silver, copper, and lead mine. When it closed in 1988, it had been the only mine still working continuously for over 1,000 years. Because of its long history of mining and testimony to the advancement and exchange of technology over many centuries, the visitor mine of Rammelsberg was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992.

== Name ==
According to legend, the mountain was named after a knight called &quot;Ramm&quot;, who was a henchman of Emperor Otto the Great. In 968, whilst out hunting, the knight tied his horse to a tree, in order to pursue some deer through almost impassable terrain. His charger impatiently pawed the ground with its hooves whilst waiting for his master to return and so exposed a vein of silver ore. According to another explanation, the name may be derived from the widespread ramsons () found on the slopes. It is most probably however, that &quot;ram&quot; is a very old word-explanation for &quot;ore with copper&quot;. In Italian today &quot;rame&quot; means &quot;copper&quot;.

== Ore formation ==

Unlike the mineral deposits of the Upper Harz, the ore deposits at the Rammelsberg were caused by the escape of hot, metal-bearing, thermal springs on the sea floor in the Devonian period. This formation is referred to as a sedimentary exhalative deposit. At the bottom of the Devonian sea, two large massive sulfide lenses formed that were later caught up in the folding of rocks during the Carboniferous period and so lie overturned at an angle in the mountain.

Ore mining started in the &quot;Old Bed&quot; or &quot;Old Orebody&quot; (&quot;Altes Lager&quot;), exposed on the surface by erosion, during the Bronze Age. The &quot;New Bed&quot; (&quot;Neues Lager&quot;) was only discovered in the 19th century as a result of specific exploration. The mines were exhausted only in the 1980s, and were shut down in 1988. The ore contained an average of 14% of zinc, 6% lead, 2% copper, 1 g/t gold and 140 g/t silver.

== Mining history ==
The mining history of the Rammelsberg occurred as a continuous process in different phases. Initially the main product was copper ore, then, (much) later lead, and with lead, silver.

The analysis of written sources and archaeological finds of unsmelted pieces of ore and slag found during archaeological excavations between 1981 and 1985 at Düna (near Osterode) in the South Harz indicates that the earliest mining activity at the Rammelsberg occurred in the late 7th century AD. Anglo-Saxon burial objects made of Harz ore were also excavated in England.

=== Middle Ages ===

Mining on the Rammelsberg was first mentioned in the records around 968 by the Saxon chronicler, Widukind of Corvey. According to his &quot;Res gestae saxonicae&quot;, Emperor Otto the Great had silver ore deposits () opened and extracted. The mining settlement of Goslar was not mentioned until 979. In 1005, attracted by the presence of silver, King Henry II of Germany had the Imperial Palace of Goslar (&quot;Kaiserpfalz Goslar&quot;) built at the foot of Mt. Rammelsberg, and held his first Imperial Assembly there in 1009. Extended by his Salian successors Conrad II and Henry III, the palace of Goslar gradually replaced the former Royal palace of Werla. 

The profitable mines remained a &quot;Reichsgut&quot; directly belonging to the Holy Roman Emperor. When in 1175 Emperor Frederick Barbarossa called for support on his campaign against the Italian cities of the Lombard League, the Welf duke Henry the Lion demanded his enfeoffment with the Goslar mines in return, which Frederick denied. Duke Henry laid siege to the town and had the mining installations demolished. Restored after his deposition in 1180, the Rammelberg mines were again contested in 1198/99 during the Welf-Hohenstaufen throne quarrel between his son Otto IV and Frederick&#x27;s son Philip of Swabia.

After Imperial influence waned, the mines were held in pledge by the council of the Imperial city of Goslar, who officially purchased the entitlement to the rights and royalties from mining (&quot;Bergregal&quot;) in 1359. A mining accident is documented in 1376, when more than 100 miners were buried and killed. The main ores mined at Rammelsberg were lead-zinc ore, copper ore, sulphur ore, mixed ore (&quot;Melierterz&quot;), brown spar (&quot;Braunerz&quot;), barite ore (&quot;Grauerz&quot;), banding ore (&quot;Banderz&quot;) and kniest along with the important minerals of galena, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, baryte and vitriols. The chief metals extracted from these ores included silver, lead, copper and zinc, on which the wealth of Goslar was based. Because of this wealth, Goslar and the Rammelsberg mines were influential in the Hanseatic League throughout the 1440s, but in 1552, control over the mine was transferred from Goslar to the Margraviate of Brandenburg

=== Modern era ===
The Goslar mines for centuries had been a thorn in the side of the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel ruling over the adjacent Harz estates. In 1552 – after decades of legal proceedings, feuds and skirmishing – Duke Henry V took the occasion of the city&#x27;s weakened position upon the Schmalkaldic War and seized ownership of the mines from the citizens. Mining operations were further promoted by Henry&#x27;s son and successor Duke Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1568. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the Goslar citizens once again tried to regain the Rammelsberg mines distinguishing themselves as loyal supporters of the Imperial forces against the Protestant commander Christian the Younger of Brunswick; however, to no avail as his nephew Duke Augustus the Younger reconciled with Emperor Ferdinand in 1642. Under the Welf dukes, gold was also won from the 18th century onwards.

With Goslar the Rammelsberg mines passed to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 and to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866. Under the 1936/37 &quot;Rammelsbergprojekt&quot;, the mine was greatly expanded at the behest of the Nazi authorities as part of the Four-year plan. The Nazis saw the Rammelsberg with its metal ores as vital to their war efforts and the difficulty of mineral dressing the ore had been technically solved (using froth flotation). This led to the construction of the present-day surface installations including the hillside processing plant and Rammelsberg shaft. The architects were Fritz Schupp and Martin Kremmer, who designed other important industrial buildings (including the &quot;Zeche Zollverein&quot; in the Ruhr area, now also a UNESCO World Heritage Site).
After more than 1000 years during which almost 30 million tonnes of ore were extracted, the mine was finally closed by the Preussag company on 30 June 1988 as the mineral deposits had been largely exhausted. A citizens&#x27; association argued forcefully against plans to demolish the surface installations and fill in the historic underground mine workings. Consequently, the disused mine was developed into a museum to preserve its heritage and display the history of the mine and its industrial equipment.

=== Prospecting in 2009 ===
In February 2009, the company, Scandinavian Highlands Holding A/S, published the results of geophysical investigations by its subsidiary, Harz Minerals GmbH, according to which hitherto unknown mineral deposits of the size of those at the Rammelsberg may be present, two kilometres west of the Rammelsberg ore deposits. In autumn 2009 several exploratory bores were sunk in the area of the Hessenkopf and Gosetal to a depth of 500–600 metres. At the end of January 2010, after a news blackout of several months, the company announced that they would soon be drilling to a depth of 800 metres, where they suspected there would be rich mineral deposits.

== World Heritage Site ==

In 1992 the museum became a UNESCO World Heritage project together with Goslar&#x27;s Old Town. In 2010 this World Heritage Site was expanded to include the Upper Harz Water Regale, Walkenried Abbey and the historic Samson Pit. The Rammelsberg Museum and Visitor Mine is an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH).

The World Heritage Site protects many artifacts from the medieval era of mining operations at the mountain, including:
* old pithead dumps and slag heaps (the oldest dating from the 10th century)
* ore transportation tracks dating from the 12th century
* the Roeder Gallery (with a flatrod system and several water wheels that support the drainage of the pit and the hoisting of ore; there is a replica in the Deutsches Museum in Munich)
* the Feuergezäher Vault (the oldest &quot;nogged&quot; (&quot;ausgemauert&quot;) underground mining space in Central Europe)
* the Rathstiefste Gallery (medieval drainage adit; decorated with coloured vitriol encrustations)
* the headframe (18th century)
* the Master Malter&#x27;s Tower (&quot;Maltermeisterturm&quot;) (oldest above-ground mining building in Germany)

== Mine installations ==

=== Master Malter&#x27;s Tower ===

The Master Malter&#x27;s Tower (&quot;Maltermeisterturm&quot;) is the oldest surviving above-ground mine building on the Rammelsberg and, probably, in Germany as well. It was built around 1500 on a slagheap on the side of the Rammelsberg. Initially the tower was used to oversee the pits; from 1578 it was used as a bell tower (&quot;Anläuteturm&quot;).

Since the mid-18th century the master malter (&quot;Maltermeister&quot;) lived in the tower. He managed the wood needed for the mine, which was measured in malters, hence the name.

=== Herzberg Pond ===

In order to have enough water to drive water wheels during times of drought the Herzberg Pond was created in 1561. Since 1926, this has been used as a woodland swimming pool. Until the closure of the mine, water was used for cooling and the warm water was pumped back into the pond where it heated the swimming basin of the woodland pool.

=== Low-grade ore dressing on the Bollrich ===
Due to the German &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; (&quot;economic miracle&quot;) after the Second World War and sharply rising lead and zinc prices in 1950, investigations were undertaken into the deposits of banding ore (&quot;Banderz&quot;). After successful trials into the processing of this low-grade ore (recoverable metal content of about 25%), the dressing of banding ore was begun in 1953 on the Bollrich above the village of Oker. Once again the mine architect, Fritz Schupp, was responsible for planning the facilities.

The site was linked to the Rammelsberg mine via the pit railway through the Gelenbeek Gallery. The removal of concentrates to the lead smelter at Oker and the Harlingerode zinc works was facilitated by a standard gauge railway line.
== Commemorative coin ==
In 2008 Goslar&#x27;s &quot;Old Town&quot; and the Rammelsberg Mine formed the motif for the annually issued 100 Euro gold coins from the series of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

== Harzer Wandernadel ==
The Rammelsberg Museum is No. 91 in the system of checkpoints forming the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network.

<doc id="251647" wikidata="Q11009" url="?curid=251647" title="Nut (fruit)">
<text>A nut is a fruit consisting of a hard or tough nutshell protecting a kernel which is usually edible. In general usage and in a culinary sense, many dry seeds are called nuts, but in a botanical context, &quot;nut&quot; implies that the shell does not open to release the seed (indehiscent).

Most seeds come from fruits that naturally free themselves from the shell, but this is not the case in nuts such as hazelnuts, chestnuts, and acorns, which have hard shell walls and originate from a compound ovary. 

== Definition ==

A seed is the mature fertilised ovule of a plant; it consists of three parts, the embryo which will develop into a new plant, stored food for the embryo, and a protective seed coat. Botanically, a nut is a fruit with a woody pericarp developing from a syncarpous gynoecium. Nuts may be contained in an involucre, a cup-shaped structure formed from the flower bracts. The involucre may be scaly, spiny, leafy or tubular, depending on the species of nut. Most nuts come from the pistils with &quot;inferior&quot; ovaries (see flower) and all are &quot;indehiscent&quot; (not opening at maturity). True nuts are produced, for example, by some plant families of the order Fagales. These include beech (&quot;Fagus&quot;), chestnut (&quot;Castanea&quot;), oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;), stone-oak (&quot;Lithocarpus&quot;) and tanoak (&quot;Notholithocarpus&quot;) in the family Fagaceae, as well as hazel, filbert (&quot;Corylus&quot;) and hornbeam (&quot;Carpinus&quot;) in the family Betulaceae.

A small nut may be called a &quot;nutlet&quot; (formerly called a nucule, a term otherwise referring to the oogonium of stoneworts). In botany, the term &quot;nutlet&quot; can be used to describe a pyrena or pyrene, which is a seed covered by a stony layer, such as the kernel of a drupe. 
Walnuts and hickories (Juglandaceae) have fruits that are difficult to classify. They are considered to be nuts under some definitions but are also referred to as drupaceous nuts.

==Evolutionary history==
== Toxicity ==

Nuts used for food are a common source of food allergens. Reactions can range from mild symptoms to severe ones, a condition known as anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. The reaction is due to the release of histamine by the body in response to an allergen in the nuts, causing skin and other possible reactions. Tree nut allergies are distinct from peanut allergy, as peanuts are legumes, whereas a tree nut is a hard-shelled nut; however, experts suggest that a person with an allergy to peanuts should avoid eating tree nuts, and vice versa.

== Consumption as food ==

Nuts contain the diverse nutrients that are needed for the growth of a new plant. Composition varies, but they tend to have a low water and carbohydrate content, with high levels of fats, protein, dietary minerals, and vitamins. 

Nuts are eaten by humans and wildlife. Because nuts generally have a high oil content, they are a significant energy source. Many seeds are edible by humans and used in cooking, eaten raw, sprouted, or roasted as a snack food, ground to make nut butters, or pressed for oil that is used in cooking and cosmetics. 

===Constituents===
Nuts are the source of energy and nutrients for the new plant. They contain a relatively large quantity of calories, essential unsaturated and monounsaturated fats including linoleic acid and linolenic acid, vitamins, and essential amino acids.

<doc id="251649" wikidata="Q953306" url="?curid=251649" title="Grimshaw (chess)">
<text>A Grimshaw is a device found in chess problems in which two pieces (usually a rook and bishop) arriving on a particular square mutually interfere with each other. It is named after the 19th-century problem composer Walter Grimshaw. The Grimshaw is one of the most common devices found in directmates.
==Examples with description==
The theme can be understood by reference to the displayed example by A. G. Corrias (published in &quot;Good Companion&quot;, 1917). 

=== A. G. Corrias example ===
The problem is a mate in two (White must move first and checkmate Black in two moves against any defense). The key is 1.Qb1, which threatens 2.Qb7#. Black has three ways to defend against this.
* One is to play 1...c3, giving his king a new flight square at c4, but this unguards d3, allowing White to mate with 2.Qd3#.

It is the other two black defenses, however, which show the Grimshaw theme.
* Black can play 1...Bb2, thus cutting off the white queen&#x27;s path to b7. However, the bishop on b2 interferes with the a2 rook and stops it moving along the rank - this allows White to play 2.Qh1# (after a different black move, this would not be possible because of 2...Rg2, blocking the check).
* Black can instead play 1...Rb2, cutting off the white queen with the rook rather than the bishop. However, just as the bishop on b2 interferes with the rook, so the rook on b2 interferes with the bishop, allowing White to play 2.Qf5# (a mate not otherwise possible, because of 2...Be5, blocking the check).

It is this mutual interference between two black pieces on the one square (in this case, a rook and a bishop on b2) that constitutes a Grimshaw.

=== Second Example ===
The key in the puzzle on the right is 1. Qd2. This move has no threat, but it leaves black in zugzwang: Black must either move one of his bishops or rooks, or move a pawn. However, any bishop or rook move must unguard one of the squares of d5, d6, d7 or d8, allowing White to mate on d5, d6 or d7 with the queen, and d8 with the knight. The lines are:

:1. Qd2!
:*1... Bxd2 2. Nd8#
:*1... Rb7 2. Qd5# (2... Bxd5 not possible)
:*1... Rc6 2. Qd5# (2... Bxd5 not possible)
:*1... Bb6 2. Qd6# (2... Rxd6 not possible; 2... exd6 not possible due to pin)
:*1... Bc6 2. Qd6# (2... Rxd6 not possible; 2... exd6 not possible due to pin)
:*1... Bb7 2. Qd7# (2... Rxd7 not possible)
:*1... Bc7 2. Qd7# (2... Rxd7 not possible)
:*1... Rb6 2. Nd8# (2... Bxd8 not possible)
:*1... Rc7 2. Nd8# (2... Bxd8 not possible)
:*1... e3 2. Bf5#
:*1... f3 2. Qxh6#
:*1... h5 2. Ng5#

==Grimshaws involving pawns==
The pieces involved in Grimshaws are usually rook and bishop, as in the previous example, although Grimshaws involving pawns are also seen, as in this mate in two example by Frank Janet (published in the &quot;St.Louis Globe Democrat&quot;, 1916):

The key is 1.Qd7, threatening 2.Qf5#. As in the previous example, Black can defend by cutting White&#x27;s queen off from its intended destination square, but two of these defences have fatal flaws in that they interfere with other pieces: 1...Be6 interferes with the pawn on e7, allowing 2.Qxc7# (2...e5 would be possible were the bishop not on e6) and 1...e6 interferes with the bishop, allowing 2.Qxa4# (2...Bc4 would be possible were the pawn not on e6). It is this mutual interference between bishop and pawn on e6 which constitutes the pawn Grimshaw. There are several other non-thematic black defences in this problem — see below for them all.

:1.Qd7 (threatening 2.Qf5#)
:*1...Be6 2.Qxc7#
:*1...e6 2.Qxa4#
:*1...Ne6 2.Nd5#
:*1...Ra5 2.Qd4#
:*1...Nxe3 2.fxe3#
:*1...Ng3 2.fxg3#

==Multiple Grimshaws==
Sometimes, multiple Grimshaws can be combined in one problem. Here are two examples by Lev Ilych Loshinsky each with three Grimshaws.

=== First example ===
This was first published in &quot;L&#x27;Italia Scacchistica&quot;, 1930. It is a mate in two. The key is 1.Rb1, with the threat 2.d4#. Each of Black&#x27;s defences produces a Grimshaw interference which stops him from capturing White&#x27;s mating piece. Black&#x27;s defences, with White&#x27;s replies, are:

*1...Re6 2.Nd7# (2...Bxd7 not possible)
*1...Be6 2.Bd6# (2...Rxd6 not possible)
*1...Rg4 2.Ne6# (2...Bxe6 not possible)
*1...Bg4 2.Bg1# (2...Rxg1 not possible)
*1...Rb2 2.Qxc3# (2...Bxc3 not possible)
*1...Bb2 2.Qf2# (2...Rxf2 not possible)

There is one other black defence: 1...Rd6 leading to the simple recapture 2.Bxd6# (this is essentially the same mate as that which follows 1...Be6).
=== Second example ===
This second Loshinsky example, also a mate in two, is from &quot;Tijdschrift v.d. Nederlandse Schaakbond&quot;, 1930, and is one of the most famous of all chess problems. It is a complete block (if White could pass his first move, then he could reply to every black move with a mate), and White&#x27;s key, 1.Bb3, holds this block, making no threat, but putting Black in zugzwang. Black has six defences leading to three Grimshaws, one of them a pawn Grimshaw:

*1...Rb7 2.Rc6# (2...Bxc6 not possible)
*1...Bb7 2.Re7# (2...Rxe7 not possible)
*1...Rg7 2.Qe5# (2...Bxe5 not possible)
*1...Bg7 2.Qxf7# (2...Rxf7 not possible)
*1...Bf6 2.Qg4# (2...f5 not possible)
*1...f6 2.Qe4# (2...Be5 not possible)

After other black moves, White can play one of the above moves to mate; the three exceptions are 1...f5, taking away that square from the king and allowed 2.Qd6# and two recaptures: 1...Rxc7 2.Nxc7# and 1...Bxd4 2.Nxd4#.

==Novotny==
A close relative of the Grimshaw is the Novotny, which is essentially a Grimshaw brought about by a white sacrifice on a square where it can be captured by two different black pieces – whichever black piece captures the white piece, it interferes with the other.

<doc id="251650" wikidata="Q1076362" url="?curid=251650" title="Jinx">
<text>A jinx (also jynx), in popular superstition and folklore, is a curse or the attribute of attracting bad or negative luck.

Examples of &quot;jinxing&quot; in the 21st-century press include the suggestion a ship might be &quot;jinxed&quot;. The connection was made with two cruise liners, the MS &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; and the &quot;Emerald Princess&quot;, after misfortunes. In the 20th century, the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; was sometimes said to be jinxed, having twice struck a friendly ship, with considerable loss of life.

== Etymology ==
The &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; states that &quot;jynx&quot;, meaning a charm or spell, was in usage in English as early as the 1690s. The same source states that &quot;jinx&quot;, with that specific spelling, is first attested in American English in 1911. Jynx/jinx is traced to the 17th-century word &quot;jyng&quot;, meaning &quot;a spell&quot;, and ultimately to the Latin word &quot;iynx&quot;, also spelled &quot;jynx&quot;, as &#x27;j&#x27; and &#x27;i&#x27; are the same letter in Latin. The Latin &quot;iynx&quot; came from the Greek name of the wryneck bird, &quot;iunx&quot;, associated with sorcery; not only was the bird used in the casting of spells and in divination, but the Ancient Romans and Greeks traced the bird&#x27;s mythological origins to a sorceress named Iynx, who was transformed into this bird to punish her for a spell cast on the god Zeus.

==History==
A &quot;Mr Jinx&quot; appeared in &quot;Ballou&#x27;s monthly magazine&quot; – Volume 6, page 276, in 1857.

Barry Popik of the American Dialect Society suggests that the word should be traced back to an American folksong called &quot;Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines&quot; written by William Lingard in 1868.

In 1887, the character Jinks Hoodoo, described as &quot;a curse to everybody, including himself&quot; appeared in the musical comedy &quot;Little Puck&quot;, and the name was quickly picked up by the press.

==In sports==
One of the uses of the word &quot;jinx&quot; has been in the context of baseball; in the short story &quot;The Jinx&quot; (1910) – later collected in the book &quot;The Jinx: Stories of the Diamond&quot; (1911) – Allen Sangree wrote:

By th&#x27; bones of Mike Kelly, I&#x27;ll do it! Yes, sir, I&#x27;ll hoodoo th&#x27; whole darned club, I will. I&#x27;ll put a jinx on &#x27;em or my name ain&#x27;t Dasher, an&#x27; that goes!

And again

And later referenced in &quot;Pitching at a Pinch&quot; (1912), Christy Mathewson explained that &quot;a jinx is something which brings bad luck to a ball player.&quot; Baseball&#x27;s most common &quot;jinx&quot; belief is that talking about a pitcher&#x27;s ongoing no-hitter will cause it to be ended. See also Curse of the Bambino.

<text>Golden moles are small insectivorous burrowing mammals endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa. They comprise the family Chrysochloridae (the only family in the suborder Chrysochloridea) and as such they are taxonomically distinct from the true moles, family Talpidae, and other mole-like families, all of which, to various degrees, they resemble as a result of evolutionary convergence. There are 21 species. Some (e.g., &quot;Chrysochloris asiatica&quot;, &quot;Amblysomus hottentotus&quot;) are relatively common, whereas others (e.g., species of &quot;Chrysospalax&quot;, &quot;Cryptochloris&quot;, &quot;Neamblysomus&quot;) are rare and endangered.

== Taxonomy ==
Despite their extreme evolutionary convergence with moles, their closest relatives are the otter shrews and tenrecs. They are more distantly related to other insectivorous African mammals such as aardvarks and elephant shrews, and even more distantly related to elephants and sirenians.

==Characteristics and affinities==
Like most burrowing mammals with similar habits, the Chrysochloridae have short legs with powerful digging claws, very dense fur that repels dirt and moisture, and toughened skin, particularly on the head. The fur varies from black to pale yellow or grey, and has an iridescent sheen of green, blue, violet or copper when viewed in light. 

Their eyes are non-functional and covered with furred skin. The external ears are just tiny openings. In particular, golden moles bear a remarkable resemblance to the marsupial moles of Australia, family Notoryctidae, which they resemble so suggestively that at one time, the marsupial/placental divide notwithstanding, some argued that they were related. Considerations that influenced the debate might have included the view that the Chrysochloridae are very primitive placentals and the fact that they have many mole-like specializations similar to specializations in marsupial moles. 

The rhinarium is a greatly enlarged, dry leathery pad that protects their nostrils while the animal digs. In this respect, too, they resemble the marsupial moles. Some authors claim their primary sense is of touch, and they are particularly sensitive to vibrations, which may indicate approaching danger. Note below, however, the observations on the malleus in the middle ear.

The species range in size from about to about . They have muscular shoulders and the forelimbs are radically adapted for digging; all the toes on the forefeet have been reduced, except for a large, pick-like third claw on the third toe. In comparison to true moles, the fifth digit is absent and the first and fourth digits are vestigial. The adaptations of the hind feet are less dramatic: They retain all five toes and are webbed as an adaptation to efficient backward shoveling of soil loosened by the front claws.

At one time, the Chrysochloridae were regarded as primitive. Supporting arguments of this included that they were thought to have originated in Gondwana, that they had a low resting metabolic rate, and that they could switch off thermoregulation when inactive. Like the tenrecs, they possess a cloaca, and males lack a scrotum. However, these points are no longer regarded as strongly suggestive of golden moles as undeveloped &quot;reptilian mammals&quot;; some are seen rather as adaptations to regional climatic conditions. Going into a torpor when resting or during cold weather enables them to conserve energy and reduce urgent requirements for food. Similarly, they have developed particularly efficient kidneys, and some species do not need to drink water at all. They tend to drown if they fall into water.

==Habits and ecology==
Chrysochloridae are subterranean, afrotherian mammals endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, and most of which are recorded from South Africa in particular. Other regions include Lake Victoria, Western Cape, and Namibia. They live in a variety of environments; forest, swamps, deserts, or mountainous terrain. &quot;Chrysospalax&quot; species tend to forage above ground in leaf litter in forests or in meadows. &quot;Eremitalpa&quot; species such as Grant&#x27;s golden mole live in the sandy Namib desert, where they cannot form tunnels because the sand collapses. Instead during the day, when they must seek shelter, they &quot;swim&quot; through the loose sand, using their broad claws to paddle, and dive down some to where it is bearably cool. There they enter a state of torpor, thus conserving energy. At night they emerge to forage on the surface rather than wasting energy shifting sand. Their main prey are termites that live under isolated grass clumps, and they might travel for a night in search of food. They seek promising clumps by listening for wind-rustled grass-root stresses and termites&#x27; head-banging alarm signals, neither of which can be heard easily above ground, so they stop periodically and dip their heads under the sand to listen.

Most other species construct both foraging superficial burrows and deeper permanent burrows for residence. Residential burrows are relatively complex in form and may penetrate as far as below ground and include deep chambers for use for refuge, and other chambers as latrines. They push excavated soil up to the surface, as in mole-hills, or compact it into the tunnel walls. 

They feed on small insects and earthworms or small vertebrates such as lizards or burrowing snakes. They depend on their sense of hearing to locate much of their prey, and the cochleas of a number of golden mole species have been found to be long and highly coiled, which may indicate a greater ecological dependence on low frequency auditory cues than seen in Talpid moles.

==Morphology==
Golden moles share a number of features, varying by species, seldom seen elsewhere among living mammals, including three forearm long-bones, hyoid-mandible articulation, and a hypertrophied malleus. Some species have hypertrophied (enlarged) middle ear ossicles, in particular the malleus. These animals have the largest malleus relative to body size of any animal. This morphology may be adapted for the detection of seismic signals. In this respect there is some apparent convergent evolution to burrowing reptiles in the family Amphisbaenidae.

==Reproduction==
Females give birth to one to three hairless young in a grass-lined nest within the burrow system. Breeding occurs throughout the year. The adults are solitary, and their burrowing territory may be aggressively defended from intruders, especially where resources are relatively scarce.

==Status==
Of the 21 species of golden mole, no fewer than 11 are threatened with extinction, the primary cause of which being human-induced habitat loss. Additionally sand mining, poor agricultural practices, and predation by domestic cats and dogs are causes of population decline.

==Classification==

The taxonomy of the Chrysochloridae is undergoing a review in the light of new genetic information. They have traditionally been listed with the shrews, hedgehogs and a grab-bag of small, difficult-to-place creatures as part of the order Insectivora. Some authorities retain this classification, at least for the time being. Others group the golden moles with the tenrecs in a new order, which is sometimes known as Tenrecomorpha, while others call it Afrosoricida and reserve Tenrecomorpha for the family Tenrecidae.

<text>The speculum is a patch, often distinctly coloured, on the secondary wing feathers, or &quot;remiges&quot;, of some birds.

Examples of the colour(s) of the speculum in a number of ducks are:

* Common teal and green-winged teal: Iridescent green edged with buff.
* Blue-winged teal: Iridescent green. The species&#x27; common name comes from the sky-blue wing coverts.
* Crested duck and bronze-winged duck: Iridescent purple-bronze, edged white.
* Pacific black duck: Iridescent green, edged light buff.
* Mallard: Iridescent purple-blue with white edges.
* American black duck: Iridescent violet bordered in black and may have a thin white trailing edge.
* Northern pintail: Iridescent green in male and brown in female, both are white on trailing edge.
* Gadwall: Both sexes have white inner secondaries.
* Yellow-billed duck: Iridescent green or blue, bordered white.

Bright wing speculums are also known from a number of other birds; among them are several parrots from the genus &quot;Amazona&quot; with red or orange speculums, though in this case the colors are pigmentary and non-iridescent.

<text>The Saint Thomas Christians, also called Syrian Christians of India, Marthoma Suriyani Nasrani, Malankara Nasrani, or Nasrani Mappila, are an ethno-religious community of Indian Christians in the state of Kerala (Malabar region), who, for the most part, employ the Eastern and Western liturgical rites of Syriac Christianity. They trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. The Saint Thomas Christians had been historically a part of the hierarchy of the Church of the East but are now divided into several different Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, Protestant, and independent bodies, each with their own liturgies and traditions. They are Malayalis and their mother tongue is Malayalam. &quot;Nasrani&quot; or Nazarene is a Syriac term for Christians, who were among the first converts to Christianity in the Near East.

Historically, this community was organised as the Province of India of the Church of the East, by Patriarch Timothy I (780–823 AD) in the eighth century, it was served by bishops and a local dynastic archdeacon. In the 14th century, the Church of the East declined in the Near East, due to persecution from Tamerlane. Portuguese colonial overtures to bring St Thomas Christians into the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, administered by their &quot;Padroado&quot; system in the 16th century, led to the first of several rifts (schisms) in the community. The attempts of the Portuguese culminated in the Synod of Diamper, formally subjugating them to the Portuguese Padroado and imposing upon them the Roman Rite of worship. The Portuguese oppression provoked a violent resistance among the Thomasine Christians, that took expression in the Coonan Cross Oath protest in 1653. This led to the permanent schism among the Thomas&#x27; Christians of India, leading to the formation of &quot;Puthenkur&quot; or &quot;Puthenkūttukār&quot; (&quot;New allegiance&quot; ) and &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; or &quot;Pazhayakūr&quot; (&quot;Old allegiance&quot;) factions. The &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; comprise the present day Syro-Malabar Church and Chaldean Syrian Church which continue to employ the East Syriac Rite liturgy. In addition to those that are a part of the Assyrian Church of the East, the &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; include converts to the Roman faith, while those who embrace the West Syriac rite are &quot;Puthenkur.&quot; The &quot;Puthenkur&quot; group, who continued to resist the Catholic missionaries, organized themselves as the independent Malankara Church and entered into a new communion with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch, inheriting from them the West Syriac Rite, replacing the old East Syriac Rite liturgy.

The Chaldean Syrian Church based in Thrissur represents the continuation of the traditional pre-sixteenth century church of Saint Thomas Christians in India. It forms the Indian archdiocese of the Iraq-based Assyrian Church of the East, which is one of the descendant churches of the Church of the East. They were a minority faction within the Paḻayakūṟ faction, which joined with the Church of the East Bishop during the 1870s.

The Eastern Catholic faction is in full communion with the Holy See in Rome. This includes the aforementioned Syro-Malabar Church, which follows the East Syriac Rite, as well as the West Syriac Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. The Oriental Orthodox faction includes the autocephalous Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and Malabar Independent Syrian Church along with the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, an integral part of the Syriac Orthodox Church headed by the Patriarch of Antioch.

Oriental Protestant denominations include the Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India. Being a reformed church influenced by British Anglican missionaries in the 1800s, the Mar Thoma Church employs a reformed variant of the liturgical West Syriac Rite. The St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India is an evangelical faction that split off from the Marthoma Church in 1961. Meanwhile, the CSI Syrian Christians represents those Malankara Syrian Christians, who joined the Anglican Church in 1836 and eventually became part of the Church of South India, a United Protestant denomination. The C.S.I. is in full communion with the Mar Thoma Syrian Church. By the 20th century, various Syrian Christians joined Pentecostal and other evangelical denominations like the Kerala Brethren, Indian Pentecostal Church of God, Assemblies of God, among others. They are known as Pentecostal Saint Thomas Christians.

== Terminology ==
The Saint Thomas Christians have also been nicknamed such due to their reverence for Saint Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have brought Christianity to India. The name dates back to the period of Portuguese colonisation. They are also known, especially locally, as &quot;Nasrani&quot; or &quot;Nasrani Mappila&quot;. The former means &quot;Christian&quot;; it appears to have been derived from the Hebrew word Netzer or the Aramaic Nasraya from Isaiah 11:1. &quot;Nasrani&quot; is evolved from the Syriac term for &quot;Christian&quot; that emerges from the Greek word &quot;Nazōraioi&quot;, Nazarene in English. &quot;Mappila&quot; is an honorific applied to members of non-Indian faiths and descendants of immigrants from the middle east who had intermarried with the local population, including Muslims (&quot;Jonaka Mappila&quot;) and Jews (&quot;Yuda Mappila&quot;). Some Syrian Christians of Travancore continue to attach this honorific title to their names. The Government of India designates members of the community as &quot;Syrian Christians&quot;, a term originating with the Dutch colonial authority that distinguishes the Saint Thomas Christians, who used Syriac (within East Syriac Rite or West Syriac Rite) as their liturgical language, from newly evangelised Christians who followed the Roman Rite. The terms &quot;Syrian&quot; or &quot;Syriac&quot; relate not to their ethnicity but to their historical, religious and liturgical connection to the Church of the East, or East Syriac Church.

==Ethnic divisions==
Internally the Saint Thomas Christian community is divided into two ethnic groups, the majority &quot;Vadakkumbhagar&quot; or Northist and the minority &quot;Tekkumbhagar&quot; or Southist. Saint Thomas Christian tradition traces the origin of these ethno-geographical epithets to the city of Kodungallur, the historic capital of the medieval Chera dynasty. The early converts of Saint Thomas the Apostle and those who later joined the faith in India are believed to have initially resided on the northern side of the city of Kodungallur and for that reason became known as Vadakkumbhagar or Northist.

In either the 4th or 8th century, the Syriac Christian merchant magnate Knai Thoma is noted to have arrived and settled in southern Kodungallur with a cohort of merchants and clergymen. Because they dwelled on the southern side, the descendants of Thoma&#x27;s migration became known as Tekkumbhagar or Southist. The Southist community is primarily known by the appellation &quot;K&#x27;nā&#x27;nāya&quot; (Syriac for Canaanite), an adjectival epithet of Knai Thoma.

The &quot;Oxford History of the Christian Church&quot; summarizes the division of the community in the following quote: 
&quot;In time, Jewish Christians of the most exclusive communities descended from settlers who accompanied Knayil Thomma (Kanayi) became known as &#x27;Southists&#x27; (Tekkumbha ̄gar)...They distinguished between themselves and &#x27;Northists&#x27; (Vatakkumbha ̄gar). The &#x27;Northists&#x27;, on the other hand, claimed direct descent from the very oldest Christians of the country, those who had been won to Christ by the Apostle Thomas himself. They had already long inhabited northern parts of Kodungallur. They had been there even before various waves of newcomers had arrived from the Babylonian or Mesopotamian provinces of Sassanian Persia.&quot;

– Historian of South Asian Studies, Robert E. Frykenberg (2010)

== History ==

=== Origin ===

According to tradition, Thomas the Apostle came to Muziris on the Kerala coast in AD 52 which is in present-day Pattanam, near Kodungallur, Kerala.

The Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala in the 1st century AD, and it was possible for an Aramaic-speaking Jew, such as St. Thomas from Galilee, to make a trip to Kerala then. The earliest known source connecting the Apostle to Northwest India, specifically the Indo-Parthian Kingdom is the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot;, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa.

A number of 3rd and 4th century Roman writers also mention Thomas&#x27; trip to India, including Ambrose of Milan, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome, and Ephrem the Syrian, while Eusebius of Caesarea records that St. Clement of Alexandria&#x27;s teacher Pantaenus from Alexandria visited a Christian community in India using the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew language in the 2nd century.

The tradition of origin of the Christians in Kerala is found in a version of the Songs of Thomas or &quot;Thomma Parvam&quot;, written in 1601 and believed to be a summary of a larger and older work. Thomas is described as arriving in or around Maliankara and founding &quot;Ēḻarappaḷḷikaḷ&quot; (Seven great churches): Kodungallur, Kottakavu, Palayoor, Kokkamangalam, Nilackal, Niranam and Kollam. Some other churches, namely Thiruvithamcode Arappally (a &quot;half church&quot;), Malayattoor and Aruvithura are often called &quot;Arappallikal&quot;. The &quot;Thomma Parvam&quot; also narrates the conversion of Jews, natives, and the local King at Kodungallur by St Thomas. It is possible that the Jews who became Christians at that time were absorbed by what became the Nasrani Community in Kerala. The &quot;Thomma Parvam&quot; further narrates St Thomas&#x27;s mission in the rest of South India and his martyrdom at Mylapore in present-day Chennai, Tamil Nadu. According to legend, the community began with Thomas&#x27;s conversion of 32 Brahmin families, namely Pakalomattom, Sankarapuri, Kalli, Kaliyankal, Koikara, Madapoor, Muttodal, Kottakara, Nedumpilly, Palackal, Panakkamattom, Kunnappilly, Vazhappilly, Payyappilly, Maliakkal, Pattamukku, Thaiyil, etc.

While there is much doubt on the cultural background of early Christians, there is evidence that some members of the St Thomas Christian community observed Brahmin customs in the Middle Ages, such as the wearing of the Upanayana (sacred thread) and having a kudumi. The medieval historian Pius Malekandathil believes these were customs adopted and privileges won during the beginning of the Brahmin dominance of medieval Kerala. He argues that the Syrian Christians in Kerala, integrated with Persian Christian migrant merchants, in the 9th century to become a powerful trading community and were granted the privileges by the local rulers to promote revenue generation and to undermine Buddhist and Jain traders who rivaled the Brahmins for religious and political hegemony in Kerala at the time.
An organized Christian presence in India dates to the arrival of East Syriac settlers and missionaries from Persia, members of what would become the Church of the East, in around the 3rd century. Saint Thomas Christians trace the further growth of their community to the arrival of Jewish-Christians (early East Syriac Christians) from the region of Mesopotamia led by Knāi Thoma (anglicized as Thomas of Cana), which is said to have occurred either in the 4th or 8th century. The subgroup of the Saint Thomas Christians known as the Knanaya or Southists trace their lineage to Thomas of Cana, while the group known as the Northists claim descent from the early Christians evangelized by Thomas the Apostle. The traditional histories of the Thomas Christians note that the immigration of the Knanites reinvigorated the church of India, which was at the moment of their arrival deprived of ecclesial leadership. The arrival of the migrants is also associated with connecting the native Church of St. Thomas with the Syriac Christian tradition of the Church of the East.

During this time period Thomas of Cana received copper plates of socio-economic and religious rights for his relations, his party, and all people of his religion. The granting of these plates is noted to have enhanced the social position of all the ancient Christians of India and secured for them royal protection from the Chera dynasty. The Thomas of Cana copper plates were extant in Kerala until the 17th century after which point they were lost.

=== Classical period ===
As the community grew and immigration by East Syriac Christians increased, the connection with the Church of the East, centred in the Persian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, strengthened. From the early 4th century the Patriarch of the Church of the East provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch Ishoyahb III solidified the Church of the East&#x27;s jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community. In the 8th century Patriarch Timothy I organised the community as the Ecclesiastical Province of India, one of the church&#x27;s Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a metropolitan bishop, dispatched from Persia, the &quot;Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India&quot;. His metropolitan see was probably in Cranganore, or (perhaps nominally) in Mylapore, where the shrine of Thomas was located. Under him were a varying number of bishops, as well as a native Archdeacon, who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.

Some contact and transmission of knowledge of the Saint Thomas Christians managed to reach the Christian West, even after the rise of the Islamic empires. Byzantine traveller Cosmas Indicopleustes wrote of Syrian Christians he met in India and Sri Lanka in the 6th century. In 883 the English king Alfred the Great reportedly sent a mission and gifts to Saint Thomas&#x27; tomb in India. During the Crusades, distorted accounts of the Saint Thomas Christians and the Nestorian Church gave rise to the European legend of Prester John.
The port at Kollam, then known as Quilon, was founded in 825 by Maruvān Sapir Iso, a Persian Christian merchant, with sanction from Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal, the king of the independent Venad or the State of Quilon, a feudatory under Sthanu Ravi Varma &quot;Perumal&quot; of the Chera kingdom. Sapir Iso is usually identified either as the East Syriac Christian merchant who led the East Syriac bishops Mar Sabor and Mar Proth to the Christians of Malabar or as the first of those two bishops. This accompanied the second Assyrian migration into the Malabar coast other than the Knanaya migration. The two bishops were instrumental in founding many Christian churches with Syrian liturgy along the Malabar coast and were venerated as &quot;Qandishangal&quot; (saints) since then by the Thomas Christians. It is believed that Sapir Iso also proposed that the Chera king create a new seaport near Kollam in lieu of his request that he rebuild the almost vanished inland seaport at Kollam (kore-ke-ni) near Backare (Thevalakara), also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils, which had been without trade for several centuries because the Cheras were overrun by the Pallavas in the 6th century, ending the spice trade from the Malabar coast. The Tharisapalli plates presented to Maruvan Sapor Iso by Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal granted the Christians the privilege of overseeing foreign trade in the city as well as control over its weights and measures in a move designed to increase Quilon&#x27;s trade and wealth.

Thus began the Malayalam Era, known as Kollavarsham after the city, indicating the importance of Kollam in the 9th century.

The great distances involved and the geopolitical turmoil of the period caused India to be cut off from the church&#x27;s heartland in Mesopotamia at several points. In the 11th century the province was suppressed by the church entirely, as it had become impossible to reach, but effective relations were restored by 1301. However, following the collapse of the Church of the East&#x27;s hierarchy in most of Asia later in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from the church, and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.

MS Vatican Syriac 22 is the oldest known Syriac manuscript copied in India. It is a lectionary of Pauline Epistles copied on AD 1301 (1612 AG) in Kodungallūr (Cranganore, ) at the Church dedicated to Mar Quriaqos.
This manuscript is written in Estrangela script by a very young deacon named Zakharya bar Joseph bar Zakharya who was just 14 at the time of writing. The scribe refers Catholicos-Patriarch of the East Yahballaha III as Yahaballaha &quot;the fifth&quot;. Johannes P. M. van der Ploeg comments that this may indicate that the patriarch was not well known among the Indian Christians.
In 1490, a delegation from the Saint Thomas Christians visited the Patriarch of the East, Shemon IV, to bring a bishop for India. One among them was Joseph the Indian, who later became famous for his visit to Rome and the account of Malabar in Book VI of &quot;Paesi novamente retrovati&quot; (1507) by Fracanzano da Montalboddo. The patriarch responded positively to the request of Saint Thomas Christians, and appointed two bishops, Mar Thoma and Mar Yohannan, dispatching them to India. These bishops, and three more (Mar Yahballaha, Mar Dinkha and Mar Yaqov) who followed them in 1503–1504, reaffirmed and strengthened traditional ties between India and the Patriarchate. They were later followed by another bishop, Mar Abraham, who died in 1597. By that time, Christians of the Malabar Coast were facing new challenges, caused by the establishment of Portuguese presence in India.

=== Portuguese contact ===
The Saint Thomas Christians first encountered the Portuguese in 1498, during the expedition of Vasco da Gama. At the time the community was in a tenuous position: though thriving in the spice trade and protected by their own militia, the local political sphere was volatile and the Saint Thomas Christians found themselves under pressure from the rajas of Calicut and Cochin and other small kingdoms in the area. The Saint Thomas Christians and the Portuguese newcomers quickly formed an alliance.

The Portuguese had a keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in spreading their version of Christianity, which had been forged during several centuries of warfare in the Reconquista. Facilitating their goals was the &quot;Padroado Real&quot;, a series of treaties and decrees in which the Pope conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered. They set up in Goa, forming a colonial government and a Latin church hierarchy under the Archbishop of Goa, and quickly set to bringing the Saint Thomas Christians under his authority.

The Portuguese subjection of the Saint Thomas Christians was relatively measured at first, but they became more aggressive after 1552, the year of the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob and of a schism in the Church of the East, which resulted in there being two rival Patriarchs—one of whom entered communion with the Catholic Church. Both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese consistently managed to outmaneuver them, and effectively cut off the Saint Thomas Christians from their hierarchy in 1575, when the Padroado legislated that neither patriarch could send representatives to India without Portuguese approval.

By 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, Aleixo de Menezes, had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon Givargis, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy. The Archbishop convened the Synod of Diamper, which implemented various liturgical and structural reforms in the Indian church. The Synod brought the parishes directly under the Archbishop&#x27;s purview; anathematised certain &quot;superstitious&quot; social customs characteristic of their Hindu neighbors, including untouchability and a caste hierarchy; and purged the liturgy, the East Syriac Rite, of elements deemed unacceptable according to the Latin protocol. A number of Syriac texts were condemned and ordered burnt, including the Peshitta, the Syriac version of the Bible. Some of the reforms, especially the elimination of caste status, reduced the Saint Thomas Christians&#x27; standing with their socially stratified Hindu neighbors. The Synod formally brought the Saint Thomas Christians into the Catholic Church but the actions of the Portuguese over the ensuing years fueled resentment in segments of the community, and ultimately led to open resistance to their power.

=== Division and defiance ===
Over the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Portuguese and the remaining native hierarchy, and after 1641 Archdeacon Thomas, the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George of Cross, was often at odds with the Latin prelates. In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the appearance in Mylapore of a mysterious figure named Ahatallah, who claimed to have been sent by the Pope, from the Church of Antioch to serve as &quot;Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China&quot;.

Ahatallah made a strong impression on the native clergy, but the Portuguese quickly decided he was an impostor, and put him on a ship bound for Europe by way of Goa. Archdeacon Thomas, desperate for a new ecclesiastical leader to free his people from the Padroado, travelled to Cochin and demanded to meet Ahatallah and examine his credentials. The Portuguese refused, stating the ship had already left for Goa. Ahatallah was never heard from in India again, inspiring false rumours that the Portuguese had murdered him and inflaming anti-Portuguese sentiments even more.

This was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians; in 1653, Thomas and community representatives met at the Church of Our Lady in Mattancherry to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Padroado Archbishop Francisco Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd. 
There are various versions about the wording of oath, one version being that the oath was directed against the Portuguese, another that it was directed against Jesuits, yet another version that it was directed against the authority of Roman Catholic Church. The independent Malankara Church regard the Coonan Cross Oath as the moment their Church regained its independence from the Catholic Church, which they lost during the Synod of Diamper. The Syro Malabar Church deny this argument and regard the Coonan Cross Oath as an explosion against decades long suppression and overbearing attitude of Padroado Latin prelates.

After the events of Coonan Cross Oath three letters were circulated claiming that they had been sent by Ahathalla. One such letter was read at a meeting at Edappally on 5 February 1653. This letter granted to the archdeacon some powers of the archbishop. On hearing it, a vast crowd enthusiastically welcomed Archdeacon Thomas as the governor of their Church and four senior priests were appointed as his counsilors, namely, Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen of Kallisseri, Kuravilangad Parambil Palliveettil Chandy, Kaduthuruthi Kadavil Chandy, Angamali Vengur Giwargis Kathanar. At a further meeting held at Alangat, on 23 May 1653, another letter was read stating that it was from Ahathalla. It instructed the Saint Thomas Christians in the absence of a bishop, twelve of the cattanars (priests) might lay their hands on Thomas, and that this would be adequate as episcopal consecration. The authenticity of these letters is not clear. Some are of the opinion that these letters might be forged by Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar who was a skilled Syriac writer. The letters were read with enthusiasm in the churches of the Thomas Christians and Archdeacon Thomas was later proclaimed bishop in a ceremony in which twelve priests laid hands on him, elevating him as Metropolitan with the title &quot;Thoma I&quot; and he added such ancient titles as &#x27;Metran of All India&#x27;, &#x27;Gate of India&#x27;.

At this point, the Portuguese missionaries attempted reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but were not successful. Later, in 1657, Pope Alexander VII sent the Italian priest Joseph Sebastiani as the head of a Carmelite mission of the &quot;Propaganda Fide&quot; to regain the trust of the dissident St. Thomas Christians. Sebastiani and other Carmelites pressed that the ordination of the archdeacon as metropolitan by the priests in the absence of another bishop was not in accordance with Church laws. They succeeded in convincing a large group of Saint Thomas Christians, including Kadavil Chandy, Palliveettil Chandy and Vengur Giwargis, and Thoma I began to lose his followers. In the meantime, Sebastiani returned to Rome and was consecrated as bishop on 15 December 1659. He reached Kerala again in 1661, being appointed as the Vicar Apostolic of Malabar by the pope. Within a short time period he restored majority of the churches that had been with Thoma I to Catholic Church. However, in 1663, with the conquest of Cochin by the Dutch, the control of the Portuguese on the Malabar coast was lost. The Dutch declared that all the European missionaries had to leave Kerala. Before leaving Kerala, on 1 February 1663, Sebastiani consecrated Palliveettil Chandy was consecrated as the bishop of the Thomas Christians who adhered to Catholic Church. He soon also designated himself as &#x27;Metran of All India&#x27; and &#x27;Gate of India&#x27;.
Thoma I, meanwhile sent requests to various Oriental Churches to receive canonical consecration as bishop. In 1665, Gregorios Abdal Jaleel, a bishop sent by the Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius ʿAbdulmasīḥ I, arrived in India and the faction under the leadership of Thoma I welcomed him. The bishop was sent in correspondence to the letter sent by Thoma I to the Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch. Bishop Abdul Jaleel consecrated Thoma I canonically as a bishop and regularised his episcopal succession. This led to the first lasting formal schism in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Bishop Palliveettil Chandy came to be known as &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; (or &quot;Old Allegiance&quot;), and the branch affiliated with Thoma I came to be known as &quot;Puthenkur&quot; (or &quot;New Allegiance&quot;). These appellations have been somewhat controversial, though, as both parties considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other party as schismatic. The &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; faction was also known as Romo-Syrians and organized as the Syrian Catholic Church whereas the &quot;Puthenkur&quot; faction was also known as &quot;Jacobite Syrians&quot; and organized as the Malankara Syrian Church.

Between 1661 and 1665, the Paḻayakūṟ faction (Syrian Catholics) claimed 72 of the 116 churches, while Archdeacon Thoma I and the Puthenkur faction (Malankara Syrians) claimed 32. The remaining 12 churches were shared between the two factions until the late nineteenth century. The Paḻayakūṟ faction is the body from which the modern Syro-Malabar Church and Chaldean Syrian Church descend. The Puthenkur faction is the body from which the Jacobite, Orthodox, CSI Syrian Christians, Marthoma, St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and Malabar Independent Syrian Church originate.

This visit of Gregorios Abdal Jaleel gradually introduced the West Syriac liturgy, customs and script to the Malabar Coast. The visits of prelates from the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch continued since then and this led to gradual replacement of the East Syriac Rite liturgy with the West Syriac Rite and the Malankara Church affiliated to the Miaphysite Christology of the Oriental Orthodox Communion. Furthermore, ʿAbdulmasīḥ I sent Maphrian Baselios Yaldo in 1685, along with Bishop Ivanios Hidayattullah who vehemently propagated the West Syriac Rite and solidified the association of the Malankara Church with the Syriac Orthodox Church.

The main body of the Paḻayakūṟ faction (Syrian Catholics) came to be known as the Syro-Malabar Church. They continued with their East Syriac traditions and stayed within the Catholic Church with Diophysite creed. They had to remain under the foreign Latin bishops, with the only exception of Palliveettil Chandy and Kariattil Ousep. Their Indian East Syriac Catholic hierarchy was restored on 21 December 1923, with Augustine Kandathil as the first Metropolitan and Head.

===Failed attempts for reunification and solidification of the schism===
A minority within the community of Saint Thomas Christians tried to preserve the use of the East Syriac Rite and re-establishing ties with Patriarchs of the Church of the East, who occasionally sent envoys to India. At the beginning of the 18th century, Bishop Shemʿon of ʿAda (d. ) and in (), Bishop Gabriel of Ardishai (d. ) arrived to India, sent by the Chaldean Patriarch. Bishop Gabriel temporarily succeeded in reviving the traditionalist community, but was faced with prolonged rivalry, both from West Syriac (Jacobite) and Latin Catholic (&quot;Propaganda Fide&quot; and &quot;Padroado&quot;) leadership.

In 1751, Jacobite Maphrian Baselios Shakrallah Qasabgi came to Kerala. He was highly instrumental in replacing the East Syriac Rite with West Syriac Rite among the &quot;Puthenkur&quot; faction. He was accompanied by Gregorios Hanna Bakhudaidi, the Jacobite Archbishop of Jerusalem, and Yukhannon (Ivanios) Christophoros of Mosul, whom the Maphrian consecrated as a bishop during his tenure in Kerala. The delegation was sent from the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate to firmly establish West Syriac Rite among the &quot;Puthenkur&quot; and regularise the orders of their leader, Thoma V. However, Thoma V died without having reconsecrated, but having himself consecrated his successor as Thoma VI. Thoma VI strongly resisted the efforts of the delegation. Very often the Syriac Orthodox delegates selected their own candidates and ordained them as priests, without consulting Thoma VI. Meanwhile, the &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; were being increasingly subjugated by their colonial Latin ecclesiastical administrators.

Thoma VI, therefore, initiated efforts to reunify both the factions. However, the Carmelite missionaries working among the &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; were reluctant to reciprocate to his efforts fearing that the indigenous bishop would take away their authority and influence over the faction after the proposed reunification of the Saint Thomas Christians was fulfilled. On the other hand, the Syriac Orthodox delegates were extending their influence upon the &quot;Puthenkur&quot;, insisting the faction to shift to the West Syriac Rite. Shakrallah, immediately prior to his death, consecrated Kurian Kattumangat as Bishop Abraham Koorilose in 1764.

By 1770, Gregorios and Ivanios had Thoma VI reconsecrated as &#x27;Dionysios I&#x27;. Thoma VI had to receive all orders of priesthood from the tonsure to the episcopal consecration. Thoma VI received support from &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; leaders, who informed him of the ill-treatment and discrimination that they faced from the missionaries. Consequently, two priestly leaders among them: Kariattil Iousep Malpan and Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar decided to meet the Pope to convey the message of Thoma VI. The Jacobite delegates were soon at odds with Thoma VI and hence in 1772 they raised Abraham Koorilose to the Metropolitan rank at the new Mattancherry Church in Cochin, constructed by Shakrallah. Abraham Koorilose received recognition from the Rajah of Cochin. Kariyattil Iousep, accompanied by Paremmakkal Thoma and two other deacons, made the trip from Kerala in 1778 and he was consecrated as the Archbishop of Cranganore in 1782. However, the efforts drastically failed because of the unexpected death of Iousep while in Goa. &quot;Varthamanappusthakam&quot;, written by Thoma Kathanar in 1785, provides the detail of this journey until the death of the archbishop.

Following this, in 1787, representatives from eighty-four &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; churches assembled at Angamaly and drew up the &quot;Angamāly Padiyōla&quot; against the colonial Latin hegemony, declaring their allegiance to the Paremmakkal Thoma and urged for the reinstatement of their native East Syriac hierarchy. Meanwhile, Dionysios I (Thoma VI) managed to imprison his rival, Abraham Koorilose who finally escaped from the states of Travancore and Cochin where the majority of Saint Thomas Christians lived to Anjoor in the territory of the Samuthiri (Zamorin of Calicut). There Koorilose spent his days in prayer and meditation in a hut. A few relatives and friends joined him there. This group, originally known as the &quot;Thozhiyur Church&quot;, was later confirmed as an independent Syrian Church in Malabar by the Madras High Court, through a verdict in 1862. Subsequently, they took the name Malabar Independent Syrian Church.

=== British period ===
In 1795, the kings of Travancore and Cochin entered into tributary alliance with the British East Indian Company to repel the attacks from Tipu Sultan. The states soon became client regimes of the company: both were forced to disband their military. The political order of the states also began to collapse. Saint Thomas Christians were hit hard by the loss of their privileged military role, their kalari network was dissolved and many families lost their livelihood. The trading class, as well as the office bearers, also suffered the setback and many Europeans who visited the states between 1801 and 1820 noted the poor and depressed condition of Saint Thomas Christians of the &quot;Puthenkur&quot;. Some partisan fund allocation for the churches by the British officials triggered a breakdown in the relationship between Saint Thomas Christians and prominent Hindu castes, at least temporarily. In 1815, the British Resident, Colonel John Munro, founded a seminary in Kottayam, for the theological education of Jacobite Christian priests and invited the Anglican missionaries to teach there. This could be regarded as the beginning of the relationship between the CMS (Church Mission Society) and the Saint Thomas Christians of the &quot;Puthenkur&quot;.

==== Further divisions ====

As a protest against the interference of the Anglican Church in the affairs of the &quot;Puthenkur&quot; faction of the Saint Thomas Christians, the Metropolitan, Cheppad Dionysios, convened a Synod at Mavelikara on 16 January 1836. There it was declared that &quot;Malankara Church&quot; would be subject to the Syrian traditions and Patriarch of Antioch. The declaration resulted in the separation of the CMS missionaries from the communion with the &quot;Malankara Church&quot;. Cheppad Dionysios, abdicated during the tenure of an Antiochian prelate named Yuyakim Koorilose (arrived , d. ). During his stay in among the &quot;Puthenkur&quot;, Koorilose completed the transition to West Syriac ritual practices. However, a minority from the &quot;Malankara Church&quot;, who were in favour of the Reformed ideologies of the missionaries, stood along with them and joined the Anglican Church. These Saint Thomas Anglicans, were the first Reformed group to emerge from the Saint Thomas Christian community and they worked along with the missionaries in their evangelical, educational and reformative activities. By 1879, the Diocese of Travancore and Cochin of the Church of England was established in Kottayam. On 27 September 1947, the Anglican dioceses in South India, merged with other Protestant churches in the region and formed the Church of South India (CSI); an independent United Church in full communion with all its predecessor denominations. Since then, Anglican Syrian Christians have been members of the Church of South India and also came to be known as CSI Syrian Christians.

In 1860, tired of their Latin subjugation, the &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; sent a delegation headed by Antony Thondanatt (d. ) to Mosul to make a plea to the Chaldean Catholic patriarch to consecrate a bishop of their own rite for them. In response, Patriarch Joseph VI Audo consecrated Thomas Rokos, titular archbishop of Basra, and dispatched him to visit the alienated Malabar Christian flock in 1861. However, the mission failed due to the protests of the apostolic delegate at Mosul, Henri Amanton, and the vicar apostolic of Verapoly. As a result, the Pope forced the Patriarch to call back the bishop. There was yet another incident on 5 June 1864. Patriarch Joseph VI consecrated Elias Mellus, bishop of Aqra, and sent him to India. But this effort too was met with the same fate as before and Mellus was called back in 1882. Meanwhile, in 1862, an attempt was made to reestablish direct ties between traditionalist Christian communities in India and the Assyrian Patriarch Shimun XVIII consecrated the aforementioned Thondanatt as Abdisho, the Metropolitan of India, but his task proved to be very difficult and challenging. He intensified his activity after 1882, fulfilling the aspirations of local Christians of the East Syriac Rite for the full re-establishment of traditional ecclesiastical structure. Until his death in 1900, he partially succeeded in organizing the local church, that was named the Chaldean Syrian Church. After his death, local Christians appealed to Shimun XIX, Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East in Qochanis who was forthcoming, and in December 1907 consecrated Abimalek Timotheus as metropolitan bishop for India. He reached his diocese in February 1908, and took over the administration. He organized ecclesiastical structures, and continued with revitalisation of the East Syriac Rite.

By June 1875, there were two factions among the &quot;Malankara Church&quot;: &quot;Conservative Party&quot; and &quot;Reform Party&quot;. Mathews Athanasius was the Malankara Metropolitan approved by the Governments of Travancore and of Cochin and he was supportive to the reforming of the Jacobite church with evangelistic ideologies. Hence the group with Mathews Athanasius was known as &quot;Reform Party&quot; The conservative faction, under the leadership of Metropolitan Pulikkottil Joseph Dionysious II, opposed the attempts to do away with the age-old traditions of the church, which resulted in a stir in the community. Being invited by this faction, the Antiochene Patriarch Ignatius Peter III arrived in Kerala. In June 1876, at the synod of Mulanthuruthy, presided over by the Patriarch, the Syrian faction formally came under the Antiochene Patriarchate. The synod condemned Mathews Athanasius for abstaining from it, but his followers stayed firm with him. His successor Thomas Athanasius and the bishop&#x27;s faction lost the lawsuit to the Patriarchal faction in the Royal Court of Travancore on 12 July 1889. Nonetheless, the Reform Party continued as an independent Church and thereafter a series of suits arose on the rights over churches and associated properties. Later they chose the name Mar Thoma Syrian Church.

In 1911, Patriarch Ignatius ʿAbdullāh II excommunicated Vattasseril Geevarghese Dionysios (Dionysios VI), the Malankara Metropolitan, due to dispute of authority over the properties of the &quot;Malankara Church&quot;. This led to the division of the Church into two groups, with one group accepting the supreme authority of the patriarch and the other supporting Dionysios VI. The group led by Dionysios VI invited Patriarch Ignatius ʿAbdulmasīḥ II, who was deposed from Patriarchate by the Turkish authorities. In 1912, ʿAbdulmasīḥ II arrived in India and he consecrated Baselios Paulose I (d. ) as Maphrian (Syriac Orthodox Catholicos). This was not recognised by the Syriac Orthodox Church. Previously ʿAbdulmasīḥ II himself had declined the request for the installation of a Maphrianate for India in 1902 during his patriarchate. The independent group under Metropolitan Dionysios VI, known as the &#x27;Metropolitan&#x27;s Party&#x27;, started endorsing the claims for autocephaly. The other group, known as the &#x27;Patriarch&#x27;s Party&#x27;, remained loyal to the Patriarch and was led by Coorilos Paulose, succeeded by Athanasius Paulose. The two sides filed a series of lawsuits in the civil courts and some parallel attempts to reconcile both the parties also took place. In 1958, bishops of both the parties sealed their reconciliation and signed a treaty which in turn recognised the autonomy of reunited factions, with its own synod of bishops under the presidency of the Catholicos. The verdict of the Supreme Court of India in 1958, legitimizing the autonomy of Kerala church, was instrumental in this formal reconciliation between the two sides. In 1964, Patriarch Ignatius Yaʿqub III consecrated Baselios Augen I (d. ) as the Catholicos. Nonetheless, in 1975, both the parties split again with the decision of the &quot;Universal Syrian Synod&quot;, held in Damascus, to depose the Catholicos in Kerala and Baselios Paulose II was consecrated as the Catholicos for the &#x27;Patriarch faction&#x27;. Today the West Syriac Oriental Orthodox community in India is divided between the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox church) and the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church (an autonomous church under the Antiochene Patriarchate).

In 1930, a section of the &quot;Malankara Church&quot; under the leadership of Archbishop Geevarghese Ivanios and Jacob Theophilos left the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and came into communion with the Catholic Church. They are known as Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. On 11 June 1932, Trivandrum was recognised as a Metropolitan See sui juris, with Thiruvalla as its suffragan. On 10 February 2005, the church was raised to the status of a Major archiepiscopal church. The canonical installation of Cyril Baselios as the first Major Archbishop took place on 14 May 2005 and simultaneously the title &#x27;Catholicos&#x27; was legitimized. The St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute (SEERI), inaugurated on 14 September 1985, comes under the Syro-Malankara Catholic Archbishop of Thiruvalla.

In 1961, there was a split in the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church which resulted in the formation of St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India.

Pentecostalism began to spread among Saint Thomas Christians from 1911, due to American missionary work. The first Syrian Pentecostals came from Kerala Brethren, who were in turn mostly ex-Marthomites. As the movement gained momentum, groups of people from all traditional St. Thomas Christian denominations became part of various emerging Pentecostal and evangelical fellowships. Pentecostals from Syrian Christian background spearheaded the movement in Kerala and to a lesser extent in India, by providing the necessary leadership for establishing denominations like Indian Pentecostal Church of God, Assemblies of God in India, Church of God (Full Gospel) in India, The Pentecostal Mission and many other Neo-charismatic churches. The Syro-Malabar Church too has a very active Charismatic ministry, operated through establishments such as the Divine Retreat Centre, Muringoor.

==== Involvement in politics ====
Participation based on caste and community divisions and sympathies has been a feature of politics in the present day state of Kerala and its predecessor entities. Until the mid-20th century the primary cause of the divisions between the various communities was competition for rights and resources.

Like other communities, Saint Thomas Christians have been involved in regional politics on a community basis. In 1888, Travancore became the first princely state in India to establish a Legislative Council, which was reformed as the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly in 1904. A few Saint Thomas Christian leaders were elected to the Legislative Council but there was resentment that their share of the available seats was proportionately less than that of other prominent castes. This resentment led to a series of campaigns for equal representation both in the legislature and in government positions. &quot;Jatiaikya Sangham&quot;, an organization formed with an objective of reuniting the &quot;Paḻayakūṟ&quot; and &quot;Puthenkur&quot; communities, came up with the idea of a newspaper that resulted in the establishment of &quot;Nasrani Deepika&quot; by Nidhirikkal Manikkathanar in 1887. Newspapers such as the &quot;Nasrani Deepika&quot; and &quot;Malayala Manorama&quot; disseminated their grievances.

In 1918, Saint Thomas Christians formed the League for Equal Civic Rights, which sought the opening of all branches of government service to Christians, Muslims and avarna Hindus, as well as an end to the practice of untouchability. Their demands were partially met in 1922 when the Revenue Department was separated from the &quot;Devaswom&quot;, a semi-government organization that managed the Hindu temples, thus removing the restriction on non-Hindus and avarnas in the executive service. In the 1920s, Saint Thomas Christian leaders such as George Joseph were advised by Mahatma Gandhi to detach from Vaikom Satyagraha, an agitation for the temple entry rights of avarna Hindus, as he considered the issue to be one of concern to Hindus alone. Titus Theverthundiyil was one of the 78 marchers selected by Gandhi to take part in the 1930 Dandi March, to break the British salt monopoly.

With the institution in 1932 of a bicameral legislature in Travancore, four Saint Thomas Christians found a place in among the 24 seats of the lower house, but not comparable with other forward castes. The 1931 census recorded over 31 per cent of the population as being Christian, compared to around 4 per cent in 1820. Some restrictions were imposed on Saint Thomas Christian parishes to start new schools and later on the Diwan attempted to take over the schools owned by the community. There followed a period of fierce confrontation between the Diwan and Saint Thomas Christians—many leaders were arrested, prominent news papers were banned and large banks owned by the community members were liquidated. In 1937, general elections were held and Joint Political Congress played a significant role to attain much better representation for allied communities. T.M. Varghese was elected as the Deputy President of the Assembly where C. P. Ramaswami Iyer was the ex officio President. On the collapse of Joint Political Congress due to internal conflicts, Saint Thomas Christian leaders allied with Nairs in a common platform- &quot;Travancore State Congress&quot; where they fought together for responsible government and also to oust Iyer. Abraham Marthoma mobilised Syrian Christians against the divan&#x27;s move not to unite with free India. In the three-member Cabinet of Travancore formed after the first general elections in 1948, Varghese was a Cabinet Minister. However the first Saint Thomas Christian to become a minister in the central government of India was Padma Vibhushan John Mathai, who served as India&#x27;s first Railway Minister and subsequently as India&#x27;s Finance Minister, taking office shortly after the presentation of India&#x27;s first Budget, in 1948.

 Though the government initiated the legislation process for reforming the land and the education sectors, these were considered as infringements over the rights by the school managements and landowners, who were predominantly Saint Thomas Christians and Nairs. The disagreements of the Saint Thomas Christians further widened and they allied with Nair Service Society to mobilize against the government, which culminated in a violent struggle, called the Liberation Struggle, in 1958. The Communist government was dismissed on 31 July 1959 and the President&#x27;s rule was imposed in the state under Article 356 of the Constitution of India.

== Socio-cultural and religious identity ==

St. Thomas Christians are a distinct community, both in terms of culture and religion. Though their liturgy and theology remained that of East-Syrian Christians of Persia, their life-style customs and traditions were basically Indian. It is oft-quoted: &quot;Nazranis are Indian in culture, Christian in faith and Syrian in liturgy&quot;.

At present, Saint Thomas Christians represent a multi-cultural group. Their culture is largely derived from East Syriac, West Syriac, Hindu, Jewish, and Latin liturgical influences, blended with local customs and later elements derived from indigenous Indian and European colonial contacts. Their language is Malayalam, the language of Kerala, and Syriac is used for liturgical purposes.

Jewish influence has been observed in Malabar Nasrani liturgy and traditions. Their celebration of Holy Liturgy (Holy Mass) was and still is called the Qurbana, which is derived from the Aramaic term &quot;Qurbana&quot; (ܩܘܪܒܢܐ), meaning &quot;sacrifice&quot;. Nasrani Qurbana used to be held in Syriac till the early 20th century.
Saint Thomas Christians typically followed the social customs of their Hindu neighbours, and the vestiges of Hindu symbolism could be seen in their devotional practices. Social sins like Untouchability entered their practices and the Synod of Diamper abolished it. The sacraments related to birth, marriage, pregnancy, death etc. also adapted nuances from Hindu religious practices. Even today, tying Minnu, a Hindu symbol of marriage is the most important rite in the Christian marriages too. In 1519, a Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa on his visit to Malabar commented on the practice of Saint Thomas Christian priests using Kudumi similar to that of Hindus, in his manuscript &quot;Book of Duarte Barbosa&quot;.

In the social stratification of medieval Malabar, Saint Thomas Christians succeeded in relating their social status with that of upper-caste Hindus on account of their numerical strength and influence and observance of many Brahmin and upper caste customs. In the 13th and 14th centuries, many Saint Thomas Christians were involved in the pepper trade for the local rulers and many were appointed as port revenue officers. The local rulers rewarded them with grants of land and many other privileges. With growing numerical strength, a large number of Saint Thomas Christians settled in the inland pepper-growing regions. They had the right to recruit and train soldiers and Christian trainers were given with the honorary title &quot;Panikkar&quot; like their Nair counterparts. They were also entitled with the privilege to collect the tax, and the tax-collectors were honored with the title &quot;Tharakan&quot;.

Like Brahmins they had the right to sit before the Kings and also to ride on horse or elephant, like the royals. They were protectors of seventeen underprivileged castes and communities and hence they were called &quot;Lords of Seventeen Castes&quot;. They did not allow the lower-castes to join their community for fear that it could imperil their upper-caste status. But this regal period ended when the community fell under the power of the Rajas of Cochin and Travancore. They owned a large number of Kalaripayattu training centers and the Rajas of Travancore and Cochin, including the renowned Marthanda Varma, recruited trained Christian warriors to defend their kingdom.
The upper-caste Hindus and Saint Thomas Christians took part in one another&#x27;s festival celebrations and in some places in Kerala, the Hindu Temples and Saint Thomas Christian Churches were built on adjoining sites by the Hindu kings. Until the 19th century, Saint Thomas Christians had the right of access to Hindu temples and some leading Saint Thomas Christians held the status of sponsors at Hindu shrines and temple festivals. But in the 19th century, Saint Thomas Christian integration with the Hindu caste system was disrupted: their clean-caste status was questioned in some localities and they were denied access to many Hindu temples. They tried to retaliate by denouncing Hindu festivals as heathen idolatry. Clashes between upper-caste Hindus and Saint Thomas Christians occurred from the late 1880s, especially when festivals coincided. Internecine violence among various Saint Thomas Christian denominations aggravated their problems.

=== Existing traditions, music, rituals and social life ===

Saint Thomas Christians still retain many of their ancient traditions and rituals, both in their social and religious life. Saint Thomas Christian services have many unique characteristics compared to others. Prior to the 1970s, the Nasrani &quot;Qurbana&quot; was completely sung in Syriac. Many of the tunes of the Saint Thomas Christian worship in Kerala, especially those in the East Syriac tradition, are remnants of ancient Syriac tunes of antiquity.

* Saint Thomas Christians observe Holy Thursday with high reverence. This day is referred to as &quot;Pesaha&quot;, a Malayalam word derived from the Aramaic or Hebrew word for Passover—Pasha or Pesah—commemorating the Last Supper of Jesus Christ during Passover in Jerusalem. The tradition of consuming &quot;Pesaha Appam&quot; after the church service is observed by the entire community under the leadership of the head of the family. Special long services followed by the Holy Qurbana are conducted during the &quot;Pesaha&quot; eve in the churches.
* The community observes Lent, locally called &quot;Anpathu noyambu&quot; (the fifty days&#x27; fast) or the &quot;Valiya noyambu&quot; (&quot;Sawma Rabba&quot;, the Great Fast), from Clean Monday or the preceding Sunday (called the &quot;Pētūrttà&quot; (meaning &quot;looking back&quot;), this is the original practice and it still prevails among the Chaldean Syrian Church) to the day before Easter, abjuring all meat, fish and egg. They also traditionally observe &quot;the 25 days&#x27; fast&quot; which ends on the day of Christmas.
* Generally, footwear is removed before entering the church and women cover their heads during worship.
*On the day of Palm Sunday known as &quot;Oshana&quot; or &quot;Hoshana&quot; Sunday, flowers are strewn about the sanctuary, loaned from the Hindu ritual of offering flowers, and the crowd shouts &quot;Oshana&quot; ( (ʾōshaʿnā) meaning &#x27;save, rescue, savior&#x27; in Aramaic). Then palm leaves are blessed and distributed after the &quot;Qurbana&quot; (Holy Mass).
* The celebration of Holy Liturgy (Holy Mass) is commonly called the &quot;Holy Qurbana&quot;, regardless of whether it is the East Syriac Holy Qurbana or West Syriac Holy Qurobo. The &quot;Holy Qurbana&quot; is mostly conducted and prayers recited in Malayalam. However, significant parts of the &quot;Holy Qurbana&quot; are sung in Syriac. During the 20th century, the &#x27;Qurbana-kramam&#x27; i.e. the &#x27;book containing the order of worship&#x27;, was translated into English, for the benefit of worshipers who lived outside Kerala, and did not know to read or write Malayalam.
* Saint Thomas Christians use East Syriac term &quot;Māràn Īshoʿ Mîshîħa&quot; (Jesus&#x27; name in Aramaic) to denote Jesus Christ.
* The Saint Thomas Christians, particularly of the West Syriac Rite, pray the canonical hours of the &quot;Shehimo&quot; seven times a day.
* Another surviving tradition is the use of &quot;muthukoda&quot; (ornamental umbrella) for church celebrations, marriages and other festivals. Traditional drums, arch decorations and ornamental umbrellas and Panchavadyam are part of the church celebrations. Their use has become popular all over Kerala.
* The sacraments and ceremonies of Saint Thomas Christians related to house building, birth and marriage have close similarity with those of Hindus in Kerala. The sacrament of Death express Christian canonical themes very distantly and the influence of Hindu culture is quite noticeable. Much stress is given to ideas concerning eternal life after death and the anticipation of Christ&#x27;s final judgment.
* Saint Thomas Christians do not marry close relatives. The rule is that the bride and groom must not be related for at least five or seven generations.
* Saint Thomas Christians generally prefer arranged marriages and the prospective partners see each other in the Pennukanal (Bride Viewing) ceremony at bride&#x27;s home.
* Saint Thomas Christian marriage customs are uniquely different from Western Christian marriage and local Hindu marriage customs. For example, engagement and marriage are usually performed together in the same service. Unlike Western Christian traditions, there is no direct ring exchange between groom and bride during engagement, rather it is offered and mediated by the Kathanar who represents Jesus Christ, symbolizing that it is God who brings the couple together into marriage. The tying of the Minnu (Mangalasutra) and the giving of the &quot;&quot;Manthrakodi&quot; or &quot;Pudava&quot; to the bride are the major wedding rituals loaned from Hinduism. &quot;Manthrakodi&quot;, a silk saree with a golden zari border is blessed by the priest and is placed by the bridegroom by covering the hair of the bride, it symbolises the &quot;Pudavakodukkal&quot;&quot; ceremony of the Nambudiri Brahmins, where similarly the bridegroom places a silk cloth by covering the head of the bride.
* Saint Thomas Christians widely use Nilavilakku (a lighted metal lamp), Kindi, Kalasha and other bronze articles in their houses and churches.
*The night before the marriage a ceremony known as &quot;&quot;Madhuram Veppu&quot;, is conducted. The ceremony is conducted separately for the bride and the bridegroom. It includes serving the bride and the bridegroom sweets by the maternal uncle. It has been loaned from the Knānāya (Southist) community&#x27;s tradition called as &quot;Chantham Charthal&quot;&quot;, where similarly the couple are served sweets. &quot;Chantham Charthal&quot; for the bride includes applying of Henna, Sandal and turmeric over the palms and legs as a symbolism of purity. The face of the bridegroom is cleanly shaved as a ritual. All the traditions are accompanied by the &quot;Panan Pattu&quot; performed by the &quot;Panan&quot; caste, who sings the grants and privileges given to the Syrian Christians.
* The traditional dress of a Saint Thomas Christian woman is the Chatta and Mundu, a seamless white garment, which is now limited to older female adherents. Following the general trend, the Sari and Churidar have become predominant among the younger generations.
* Many artforms like Margamkali (an ancient dance form performed in a circular configuration with a Nilavilakku at the centre) and Parichamuttukali (an ancient martial dance form where Syrian Christian men with swords and shields follows the movements and steps of Kalaripayattu) still exist amongst the Saint Thomas Syrian Christian community.

===Church architecture===

The earliest documentary evidence is Tharisapally Copper Plate, which refers to the construction of the church of Tharisapally in Quilon between 823 and 849 AD. Antonio Gouvea, Portuguese envoy to Malabar, mentions in his 16th-century work &quot;Jornada&quot; that almost all the churches of Saint Thomas Christians followed the models of Hindu temples of that period, but were distinguished by the huge granite cross in the front yard of the church. Despite the external similarity with temples, the structuring of the interior space of the church always followed the East Syriac architectural theology. Thus the contemporary style is formed as an amalgamation of Indian architecture and Assyrian liturgical concepts. The church is arranged east-to-west, with the interior structured into three levels: the &quot;madbaha&quot; (sanctuary), the &quot;qestroma&quot; (choir) and the &quot;haykla&quot; (nave).

The &quot;madbaha&quot;, arranged in the topmost platform at the eastern side of the building, represents Heaven. The primary altar is attached to the eastern wall. To the north of the &quot;madbaha&quot; is the &quot;diaqonikon&quot; (sacristry); to the south is the baptistery.The &quot;madbaha&quot; is protected with rails and is veiled by a red curtain most of the time; this is opened during the Holy Qurbana (Eucharist). An oil lamp within the sanctuary is kept glowing at all times to represent the presence of God. The &quot;madbaha&quot; is connected to the &quot;qestroma&quot; and &quot;haykla&quot; by a low-walled path called the &quot;sqaqona&quot;. The &quot;qestroma&quot; contains seats for the choir and lower clergy. The &quot;haykla&quot; contains an elevated platform or &quot;bema&quot;, which includes an altar, two lecterns for reading, and chairs for higher clergy. Worshipers stand before the altar, with separate seating for men and women.

The main entrance is on the western side of the building; a vestibule, pillars, pilasters, and other architectural ornaments adorn the front end, and a flag mast stands in the front yard. One or two bells are installed in the back yard to signal the timing of ritual services, the death of a church member, or to inform the public of calamities.

===The Persian Crosses===

The East Syriac Churches of the St. Thomas Christians have accepted the Persian cross as their symbol. They call it the Nasrani Menorah or Mar Thoma Sleeva (St. Thomas&#x27; Cross). There are several interpretations for the St. Thomas Christian Symbol. The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish menorah, an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of seven branched lamp stand (candelabra). The St. Thomas&#x27; Cross also appears on the official emblem of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.

The interpretation based on local culture states that the Cross without the figure of Jesus and with flowery arms symbolising &quot;joyfulness&quot; points to the resurrection theology of St. Paul, the downward-facing bird (most likely a dove) on the top represents the role of the Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Cross indicates Christ. The lotus symbolizing God the Father, who has begotten the Son. The three steps indicate Calvary and symbolise the Church, the channel of grace flowing from the Cross. The lotus may also symbolise the cultural association with Buddhism and the Cross over it shows that Christianity was established in the land of Buddha.

== Today ==

Writing in 2010, Devika and Varghese noted that &quot;[The St. Thomas Christians] are at present a substantial minority, a powerful presence in all fields of life in Kerala.&quot;

=== Socioeconomic status ===
Even though the Saint Thomas Christians had to compromise their social and religious privileges in the aftermath of Portuguese subjugation, they started reemerging as a powerful community from the 19th century onward. They played a pioneering role in many spheres such as banking, commerce, cash crops, print media, the film industry, etc. Around 2003, among Saint Thomas Christians, 17.4 percent of the adult population are self-employed – the highest rate statistically among all the communities in the state of Kerala. Saint Thomas Christians lead all others with respect to per capita ownership of land, with many of them owning large estates. With changing conditions, they have shifted from the agriculture of rice and coconut to plantation based agriculture and the trading of rubber, spices and cash crops. They also take a prominent role in the educational institutions of Kerala and throughout India. The educational accomplishments of the community have helped its members to attain a good proportion of the Central and State Government jobs. Kerala Government in the year 2024 happened to present the community wise account of the government employees in its Legislative Assembly. According to the data, out of the then total 5,45,423 government employees in the state, 73,713 are from forward Christian communities, ie., Saint Thomas Christians, which accounts for the 13.5 percent of the total government employees. With their level of education and limited employment opportunities within the state of Kerala, they became the community with the highest rate of migration. Their resultant foreign remittances have also helped the socioeconomic progress of the community. According to the Kerala Migration Survey (1998) by the Center for Developmental Studies, Kerala, Saint Thomas Christians top all other communities in Kerala with respect to the Socioeconomic Development Index which is based on parameters such as the possession of &quot;land, housing &amp; consumer durables&quot;, education and employment status.

=== Demographics ===
The Saint Thomas Syrian Christians form 12.5 percent of the total population of Kerala and 70.73 percent of the Christians in the state. K. C. Zachariah notes that the 20th century was period of significant transition for the Saint Thomas Christians in terms of its demographic and socioeconomic status. Around 1900, the community was concentrated in a few areas, was geographically static and &quot;... was characterised by very high death rate, very high birth rate, very early age at marriage, and 10 to 12 children per married woman&quot;. The population had increased eight-fold during the preceding century, from a base figure of about 100,000, and comprised nearly 50 per cent children. But, the population growth of Saint Thomas Christians came down drastically after the 1960s, with the lowest birth rate, highest age at marriage, highest family planning user rate, and lowest fertility rate compared to other communities in Kerala. The proportion of children has come down to less than 25 percent. The absolute and relative size of the community is in a diminishing trend and is approaching a zero population growth regime.

, in Kerala, more than 85 per cent of the Saint Thomas Christian population live in the seven southern districts of the state – Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam and Trissur. They have also migrated to other cities in India like Ooty, Mangalore, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Delhi, Mumbai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Migration steeply increased in the post-independence period and major destinations were United States of America, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and the Middle East. According to a rough estimate, 20–25 percent of the Saint Thomas Christians live outside the state of Kerala.

==Syrian Christian caste status ==
Despite the sectarian differences, Saint Thomas Syrian Christians share a common social status within the Caste system of Kerala and is considered as an Upper caste community.

In historic kingdoms of Kerala such as those of Cochin and Travancore, Saint Thomas Christians were granted caste privileges that put them on the same level as Upper caste Hindus. Anthropologist, L.K. Ananthakrishna Iyer recorded that they were given privileges in addition to those granted to groups such as Nairs, such as the right to have enclosures in front of their houses, which was otherwise only granted to the Brahmins, and were placed &quot;almost on par with the Sovereigns&quot;. They followed the same rules of caste and pollution as did Hindus, and sometimes they were considered to be pollution neutralisers. Decree II of Action IX of the Synod of Diamper enforced by the Portuguese Inquisition in 1599 prohibited the practice of untouchability by the Saint Thomas Christians except in practical circumstances when required by law and when it was necessary to ensure social contact with the Varna Hindus.

They tend to be endogamous, and tend not to intermarry even with other Christian groupings. Internal division of Saint Thomas Christians into Northists and Southists and also into a number of sects based on the ecclesiastical orientation makes the pattern of segmentation an exceedingly complex. Forrester suggests that the Northist-Southist division forms two groups within the Saint Thomas Christian community which are closely analogous to sub-castes.

== Christian conventions ==
The Maramon Convention is one of the largest annual Christian gatherings in Asia. It takes place in Maramon, near Kozhencherry, during February on the vast sand-bed of the Pamba River next to the Kozhencherry Bridge. The first convention was held in March 1895 for 10 days.

Another major convention in Kerala is the annual Central Travancore Convention held at Saint Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Makamkunnu of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. The first convention was held in 1915.

One of the biggest conventions of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church is the Kallooppara Orthodox Convention. It takes place on the Koithottu sand banks of the Manimala River with over 5,000 annual participants. This convention was started in 1943 lasting 8 days.

Ranni Orthodox Convention is an annual convention of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. The convention is now held in Ranni town at Mar Gregorios Catholicate Centre and began in 1967.

Mallapally Orthodox Syrian Convention of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church is an annual convention in Mallapally, Pathanamthitta. The first convention took place in 1989 at Mallapally Valiyapally (St. John&#x27;s Bethany Orthodox Valiyapally).

Trivandrum Orthodox Convention is an annual convention organized by Trivandrum Orthodox Diocese. The convention takes place at Holy Trinity Aramana, Ulloor and was started in 1988.

<text>Pierre Alechinsky (; born 19 October 1927) is a Belgian artist. He has lived and worked in France since 1951. His work is related to tachisme, abstract expressionism, and lyrical abstraction.

==Life==
Alechinsky was born in Schaerbeek, Belgium, to a Russian Jewish father and a Belgian Walloon mother. In 1944, he attended the l&#x27;École nationale supérieure d&#x27;Architecture et des Arts décoratifs de La Cambre, Brussels where he studied illustration techniques, printing, and photography. In 1945, he discovered the work of Henri Michaux, Jean Dubuffet and developed a friendship with the art critic Jacques Putman.

==Art career==
In 1949, he joined Christian Dotremont, Karel Appel, Constant, Jan Nieuwenhuys, and Asger Jorn to form the art group COBRA. He participated both with the COBRA exhibitions and went to Paris to study engraving at Atelier 17 under the guidance of Stanley William Hayter in 1951.

In 1954, he had his first exhibition in Paris and started to become interested in Chinese and Japanese calligraphy. In the early 1950s he was the Paris correspondent for the Japanese journal Bokubi (the Beauty of Ink) published by Morita Shiryu of the Bokujinkai group. In 1955, encouraged by Henri Storck and Luc de Heusch, he left for Japan with his wife. He exhibited Night, 1952 (Ohara Museum of Art, Kurashiki) and made a film: Japanese Calligraphy – Christian Dotremont would write the commentary with music by André Souris.

By 1960, he had exhibited in London, Bern, and at the Venice Biennial, and then in Pittsburgh, New York City, Amsterdam, and Silkeborg as his international reputation grew.

He worked with Walasse Ting and continued to be close to Christian Dotremont. He also developed links with André Breton.

His international career continued throughout the seventies and by 1983 he became Professor of painting at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. For the season 2018/2019 at the Vienna State Opera Pierre Alechinsky designed the large-scale picture (176 sqm) &quot;Loin d&#x27;ici&quot; as part of the exhibition series &quot;Safety Curtain&quot;, conceived by museum in progress.

==Awards==
In 1994 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Free University of Brussels, and in 1995 one of his designs was used on a Belgian stamp.

==Collections==
His works are held in the collections of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, the Tate, Museum Ludwig in Cologne, the New York Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Art Museum of Southeast Texas in Beaumont, Texas, the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale, Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the Fisogni Museum in Tradate, Italy. The main-belt asteroid 14832 Alechinsky was named in his honour in October 2000.

<text>Cacophony was an American heavy metal band formed in 1986 by guitarists Marty Friedman and Jason Becker, and signed to Shrapnel Records. They released two studio albums and remained active until 1989, after which both guitarists forged their own solo careers and joined other bands.

==History==
The two albums released by Cacophony, &quot;Speed Metal Symphony&quot; (1987) and &quot;Go Off!&quot; (1988), were showpieces of the kind of highly technical playing typical of the 1980s shred era, with songs featuring fast tempos, melodic solos, exotic neoclassical scales and dual guitar harmonizations. Several of the tracks were entirely instrumental, which prominently demonstrated Friedman and Becker&#x27;s renowned technical skills. In a 2009 article by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, &quot;Speed Metal Symphony&quot; was ranked ninth in a list of all-time top ten shred albums.

Both Friedman and Becker released their own solo albums—&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Kiss&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Burn&quot;, respectively—in 1988, before the release of &quot;Go Off!&quot; Friedman later joined the thrash metal band Megadeth in 1990, remaining with them for nine years as well as releasing several more solo albums, while Becker enjoyed a short stint in David Lee Roth&#x27;s solo band from 1989 to 1991. Becker&#x27;s time with Roth was abruptly cut short due to an onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative disease that rendered him completely unable to play and, soon afterwards, move or speak.

<doc id="251678" wikidata="Q7776868" url="?curid=251678" title="The Zero Hour (Japanese radio series)">
<text>was the first of over a dozen live radio programs broadcast by Japan during the Pacific War. To reach a large geographical area these transmissions included shortwave radio frequencies in the 31 m band. The program featured Allied prisoners of war (POW) reading current news and playing prerecorded music, and sending messages from POWs to their families back home and to Allied soldiers and sailors serving in the Pacific theater. These messages were interlaced with demoralizing commentary and appeals to surrender or sabotage the Allied war effort. &quot;The Zero Hour&quot; also featured the female announcer, Iva Toguri D&#x27;Aquino, one of several who were dubbed Tokyo Rose.

&quot;The Zero Hour&quot; was the brainchild of Major Shigetsugu Tsuneishi, who joined the Japanese Imperial Army&#x27;s 8th Section G-2 (Psychological Warfare) unit as the Army representative to the Information Liaison Confidential Committee, which oversaw the coordination of the nationalized news agencies, in November 1941. His first effort was a propagandistic photographic magazine called &quot;Front&quot;, based on the format of the American magazine &quot;Life&quot;.

Major Tsuneishi established an office at Radio Tokyo (NHK) and issued orders to the NHK Overseas Bureau&#x27;s American, European, Asian, Editorial and Administration Divisions through Bureau Chief Yoshio Muto. Thereafter, all news broadcasts became official announcements of the Japanese Imperial Army General Headquarters (GHQ). The American Division radio announcers section was headed by Yuichi Hirakawa, a native Japanese with a degree in Dramatics from the University of Washington.

Tsuneishi acquired a veteran radio announcer with the capture of Australian Army Major Charles Cousens, who had been a popular and highly regarded news commenter in Sydney before the War. During an interrogation at the General Staff HQ in Tokyo on August 1, 1942, Tsuneishi made it clear to Cousens that he had to broadcast for the Japanese or face execution before putting him to work at 6 p.m. that same evening. Cousens was subsequently tasked with writing and broadcasting &quot;radio essays&quot; on the need to have high ideals as a human being, collections of platitudes with no propaganda value.
