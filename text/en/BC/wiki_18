<text>A virtual pet (also known as a digital pet, artificial pet, or pet-raising simulation) is a type of artificial human companion. They are usually kept for companionship or enjoyment, or as an alternative to a real pet.

Digital pets have no concrete physical form other than the hardware they run on. Interaction with virtual pets may or may not be goal oriented. If it is, then the user must keep it alive as long as possible and often help it to grow into higher forms. Keeping the pet alive and growing often requires feeding, grooming and playing with the pet. Some digital pets require more than just food to keep them alive. Daily interaction is required in the form of playing games, virtual petting, providing love and acknowledgment can help keep your virtual pet happy and growing healthy.

Digital pets can be simulations of real animals, as in the Petz series, or fantasy ones, like the Tamagotchi or Digimon series. Unlike biological simulations, the pet does not usually reproduce.

==Types==

===Web-based===
Virtual pet sites are usually free to play for all who sign up. They can be accessed through web browsers and often include a virtual community, such as Neopia in Neopets. In these worlds, a user can play games to earn virtual money which is usually spent on items and food for pets. One large branch of virtual pet games are sim horse games.

Some sites adopt out pets to put on a webpage and use for role-playing in chat rooms. They often require the adoptee to have a page ready for their pet. Sometimes they have a setup for breeding one&#x27;s pets and then adopting them out.

===Software-based===
There are many video games that focus on the care, raising, breeding or exhibition of simulated animals. Such games are described as a sub-class of life simulation game. Since the computing power is more powerful than with webpage or gadget based digital pets, these are usually able to achieve a higher level of visual effects and interactivity. Pet-raising simulations often lack a victory condition or challenge, and can be classified as software toys.

The pet may be capable of learning to do a variety of tasks. &quot;This quality of rich intelligence distinguishes artificial pets from other kinds of A-life, in which individuals have simple rules but the population as a whole develops emergent properties&quot;. For artificial pets, their behaviors are typically &quot;preprogrammed and are not truly emergent&quot;.

A screen mate is a downloadable virtual pet that creates a small animation that walks around a computer desktop and over open screens unpredictably. Each pet is a small animation of an animal (such as a sheep or a frog, or in some cases a human or bottle cap) that can be interacted by clicking on or dragging, which lifts the pet as if you were picking it up. Most screen mates are free to download and used for entertainment purposes.

==History==
The first-known virtual pet was a screen-cursor chasing cat called Neko. It was rather called a &quot;desktop pet&quot; since at that time the term &quot;virtual pet&quot; did not exist.

PF.Magic released the first widely popular virtual pets in 1995 with &quot;Dogz&quot;, followed by &quot;&quot; in the spring of 1996, eventually becoming a franchise known as &quot;Petz&quot;. The digital pets were further popularized when Tamagotchi and Digimon were introduced in 1996 and 1997.

Digital pets like Tamagotchi and Digimon were a massive fad across Japan, the United States and United Kingdom during the late 1990s. Today, there are also &quot;Digital Pets&quot; which have physical robotic bodies, known as Ludobots or entertainment robots.

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, virtual pets specialized to be official mascots of personal websites known as &quot;cyber pets&quot; (or &quot;cyberpets&quot;) could be especially seen in websites hosted with GeoCities, Tripod, or Angelfire. There were also webpages which allowed users to &quot;adopt&quot; cyber pets for their websites.

==Controversy==
The popularity of virtual pets in the United States, and the constant need for attention the pets required, led to them being banned from schools across the country, a move that hastened the virtual pet&#x27;s decline from popularity.

A &quot;Mad&quot; cover on regular issue #362, October 1997 shows a gun being pointed at a virtual pet with Alfred E. Neuman&#x27;s face and the line &quot;If you don&#x27;t buy this magazine, we&#x27;ll kill this virtual pet!&quot; Illustrated by Mark Fredrickson. The cover parodies the January 1973 issue of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; which depicted a gun being held to a real dog&#x27;s head and the line, &quot;If you don&#x27;t buy this magazine, we&#x27;ll kill this dog.&quot;

=== Relationship with digital pet ===
There is research concerning the relationship between digital pets and their owners, and their impact on the emotions of people. For example, Furby affects the way people think about their identity, and many children think that Furby is alive in a &quot;Furby kind of way&quot; in Sherry Turkle&#x27;s research.

==Common features==

There are many common features between different digital pets, some of them are used to give a sense of reality to the user (such as the pet responding to &quot;touch&quot;), and some for enhancing playability (such as training).

===Communication===
With advanced video gaming technology, most modern digital pets do not show a message box nor icon to display the pet&#x27;s internal variable, health state or emotion like earlier generations (such as Tamagotchi). Instead, users can only understand the pet by interpreting their actions, body language, facial expressions, etc. This helps to make a pet&#x27;s behavior seem natural, rather than calculated, and fosters a feeling of a relationship between user and digital pet.

===Sense of reality===
To give a sense of reality to users, most digital pets have certain level of autonomy and unpredictability. The user can interact with the pet and this process of personalizing can make the pet more distinctive. Personalizing increases the feeling of responsibility for the pet to the user. For example, if a Tamagotchi is unattended for long enough, it will &quot;die&quot;.

===Interactivity===
To increase user&#x27;s personal attachment to the pet, the pet interacts with the user. Interactivity can be classified into two categories: Short-term and long-term.

Short-term interactivity includes direct interaction or action to reaction from the pet. Example: &quot;touch&quot; a pet with mouse cursor and the pet will give a direct response to the &quot;touching&quot;.

Long-term interactivity includes action that affects the pet&#x27;s growth, behavior or life span. For example, training a pet may have a good effect on the pet&#x27;s behavior. Long-term interactivity is quite important for a sense of reality as the user would think that he has some lasting influence on the pet.

Two kinds of interactivity are often combined. Training (long-term interaction) may happen through continuing short-term interaction. Similarly, playing with a pet (short-term interaction) may, if continued over the long term, make the pet more optimistic.

===Example of common features===
# Responds to calling
# Responds to touching
# Training the pet
# Supplies or toys for the pet
# Dressing up the pet
# Competition or trial amongst pets
# Meeting other pets
# Complaining when it needs care

<doc id="242604" wikidata="Q1367461" url="?curid=242604" title="Mass customization">
<text>Mass customization makes use of flexible computer-aided systems to produce custom products. Such systems combine the low unit costs of mass production processes with the flexibility of individual customization.

Mass customization is the new frontier in business for both manufacturing and service industries. At its core, is a tremendous increase in variety and customization without a corresponding increase in costs. At its limit, it is the mass production of individually customized goods and services. At its best, it provides strategic advantage and economic value.

==Product design strategy==
Mass customization is a product design strategy and is currently used with both delayed differentiation and modular design to enhance the value delivered to customers.

Mass customization is the method of, &quot;effectively postponing the task of differentiating a product for a specific customer until the latest possible point in the supply network&quot;.

From a collaborative engineering perspective, mass customization can be viewed as collaborative efforts between customers and manufacturers, who have different sets of priorities and need to jointly search for solutions that best match customers&#x27; individual specific needs with manufacturers&#x27; customization capabilities.

==History==
The concept of mass customization is attributed to Stan Davis in &quot;Future Perfect&quot;, and was defined by as &quot;producing goods and services to meet individual customers&#x27; needs with near mass production efficiency&quot;. concurred, calling it &quot;a strategy that creates value by some form of company-customer interaction at the fabrication and assembly stage of the operations level to create customized products with production cost and monetary price similar to those of mass-produced products&quot;. Similarly, highlights that mass customization involves balancing operational drivers by defining it as, &quot;the capability to manufacture a relatively high volume of product options for a relatively large market (or collection of niche markets) that demands customization, without tradeoffs in cost, delivery and quality&quot;.

==Implementation==
Many implementations of mass customization are operational today, such as software-based product configurators that make it possible to add and/or change functionalities of a core product or to build fully custom enclosures from scratch. This degree of mass customization, however, has only seen limited adoption. If an enterprise&#x27;s marketing department offers individual products (atomic market fragmentation), it doesn&#x27;t often mean that a product is produced individually, but rather that similar variants of the same mass-produced item are available. Additionally, in a fashion context, existing technologies to predict clothing size from user input data have been shown to be not yet of high enough suitability for mass customization purposes.

Companies that have succeeded with mass-customization business models tend to supply purely electronic products. However, these are not true &quot;mass customizers&quot; in the original sense, since they do not offer an alternative to mass production of material goods.

==Variants==
 described four types of mass customization:
* Collaborative customization (also considered co-creation) – Firms talk to individual customers to determine the precise product offering that best serves the customer&#x27;s needs (see personalized marketing and personal marketing orientation). This information is then used to specify and manufacture a product that suits that specific customer. For example, some clothing companies will manufacture pants or jackets to fit an individual customer. This is also being taken into deeper customization via 3D printing with companies like Shapeways. Examples: Tailored suits; Converse lets consumers choose the color or pattern of every element of certain types of shoes, either in-store or online.
* Adaptive customization – Firms produce a standardized product, but this product is customizable in the hands of the end-user (the customers alter the product themselves). Example: Lutron lights, which are programmable so that customers can easily customize the aesthetic effect.
* Transparent customization – Firms provide individual customers with unique products, without explicitly telling them that the products are customized. In this case there is a need to accurately assess customer needs. Example: Google AdWords and AdSense
* Cosmetic customization – Firms produce a standardized physical product, but market it to different customers in unique ways. Example: Soft Drink served in: A can, 1.25L bottle, 2L bottle.

He suggested a business model, &quot;the 8.5-figure-path&quot;, a process going from invention to mass production to continuous improvement to mass customization and back to invention.

==Market research==
Kamis, Koufaris and Stern (2008) conducted experiments to test the impacts of mass customization when postponed to the stage of retail, online shopping. They found that users perceive greater usefulness and enjoyment with a mass customization interface vs. a more typical shopping interface, particularly in a task of moderate complexity.

<doc id="242606" wikidata="Q161904" url="?curid=242606" title="Khufu">
<text>Khufu or Cheops (died 2566 BC) was an ancient Egyptian monarch who was the second pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty, in the first half of the Old Kingdom period (26th century BC). Khufu succeeded his father Sneferu as king. He is generally accepted as having commissioned the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but many other aspects of his reign are poorly documented.

The only completely preserved portrait of the king is a small ivory figurine found in a temple ruin of a later period at Abydos in 1903. All other reliefs and statues were found in fragments, and many buildings of Khufu are lost. Everything known about Khufu comes from inscriptions in his necropolis at Giza and later documents. For example, Khufu is the main character noted in the Westcar Papyrus from the 13th dynasty.

Most documents that mention king Khufu were written by ancient Egyptian and Greek historians around 300 BC. Khufu&#x27;s obituary is presented there in a conflicting way: while the king enjoyed a long-lasting cultural heritage preservation during the period of the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom, the ancient historians Manetho, Diodorus and Herodotus hand down a very negative depiction of Khufu&#x27;s character. As a result, an obscure and critical picture of Khufu&#x27;s personality persists.

== Khufu&#x27;s name ==
Khufu&#x27;s name was dedicated to the god Khnum, which might point to an increase of Khnum&#x27;s popularity and religious importance. In fact, several royal and religious titles introduced at this time may point out that Egyptian pharaohs sought to accentuate their divine origin and status by dedicating their cartouche names (official royal names) to certain deities. Khufu may have viewed himself as a divine creator, a role that was already given to Khnum, the god of creation and growth. As a consequence, the king connected Khnum&#x27;s name with his own. Khufu&#x27;s full name (Khnum-khufu) means &quot;Khnum protect me&quot;. While modern Egyptological pronunciation renders his name as &quot;Khufu&quot;, at the time of his reign his name was probably pronounced as &quot;Kha(w)yafwi(y)&quot;, and during the Hellenized era, &quot;Khewaf(w)&quot;.

The pharaoh officially used two versions of his birth name: &quot;Khnum-khufu&quot; and &quot;Khufu&quot;. The first (complete) version clearly exhibits Khufu&#x27;s religious loyalty to Khnum, the second (shorter) version does not. It is unknown as to why the king would use a shortened name version since it hides the name of Khnum and the king&#x27;s name connection to this god. It might be possible though, that the short name was not meant to be connected to any god at all.

Khufu is well known under his Hellenized name , Khéops or Cheops (, , by Diodorus and Herodotus) and less well known under another Hellenized name, , Súphis (, , by Manetho). A rare version of the name of Khufu, used by Josephus, is , Sofe (, ). (The pronunciations given here are for English; the pronunciations in Ancient Greek were different.) Arab historians, who wrote mystic stories about Khufu and the Giza pyramids, called him Saurid () or Salhuk (سلهوق).

==Family==
=== Khufu&#x27;s origin ===

The royal family of Khufu was quite large. It is uncertain if Khufu was actually the biological son of Sneferu. Egyptologists believe Sneferu was Khufu&#x27;s father, but only because it was handed down by later historians that the eldest son or a selected descendant would inherit the throne. In 1925, the tomb of queen Hetepheres I, &quot;G 7000x&quot;, was found east of Khufu&#x27;s pyramid. It contained many precious grave goods, and several inscriptions give her the title &quot;Mut-nesut&quot; (meaning &quot;mother of a king&quot;), together with the name of king Sneferu. Therefore, it seemed clear at first that Hetepheres was the wife of Sneferu, and that they were Khufu&#x27;s parents. More recently, however, some have doubted this theory, because Hetepheres is not known to have borne the title &quot;Hemet-nesut&quot; (meaning &quot;king&#x27;s wife&quot;), a title indispensable to confirm a queen&#x27;s royal status. 

Instead of the spouse&#x27;s title, Hetepheres bore only the title &quot;Sat-netjer-khetef&quot; (verbatim: &quot;daughter of his divine body&quot;; symbolically: &quot;king&#x27;s bodily daughter&quot;), a title mentioned for the first time. As a result, researchers now think Khufu may not have been Sneferu&#x27;s biological son, but that Sneferu legitimised Khufu&#x27;s rank and familial position by marriage. By apotheosizing his mother as the daughter of a living god, Khufu&#x27;s new rank was secured. This theory may be supported by the circumstance that Khufu&#x27;s mother was buried close to her son and not in the necropolis of her husband, as it was to be expected.

=== Family tree ===
The following list presents family members, which can be assigned to Khufu with certainty.Parents:
* Sneferu: Most likely his father, maybe just his stepfather. Famous pharaoh and builder of three pyramids.
* Hetepheres I: Most likely his mother. Wife of king Sneferu and well known for her precious grave goods found at Giza.
Spouses:
* Meritites I: First wife of Khufu
* Henutsen: Second wife of Khufu. She is mentioned on the famous Inventory Stela.

Brothers and sisters:
* Hetepheres: Wife of Ankhhaf
* Ankhhaf: The eldest brother. His nephew would later become pharaoh Khafra.
* Nefermaat: Half-brother; buried at Meidum and owner of the famous &quot;mastaba of the geese&quot;
* Rahotep: Elder brother or half-brother. Owner of a life-size double statue portraying him and his wife &quot;Nofret&quot;, displayed in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo.

Sons of Khufu:
* Kawab: Most possibly the eldest son and crown prince, he died before Khufu&#x27;s own end of reign and thus did not follow Khufu on the throne.
* Djedefra: Also known as Radjedef and Ratoises. Became the first throne successor. 
* Khafre: Most possibly second throne successor
* Djedefhor: Also known as Hordjedef. Mentioned in the Papyrus Westcar 
* Baufra: Possibly a son of Khufu, but neither archaeologically nor contemporarily attested. Only known from two much later documents. 
* Babaef I: Also known as Khnum-baef I

==Reign==
=== Length of reign ===
It is still unclear how long exactly Khufu ruled over Egypt. Dates from Khufu&#x27;s final years suggest that he was approaching his 30-year jubilee, but may have just missed it.

One of them was found at the Dakhla Oasis in the Libyan Desert. Khufu&#x27;s serekh name is carved in a rock inscription reporting the &quot;&quot;Mefat&quot;-travelling in the year after the 13th (biennial) cattle count under Hor-Medjedu&quot;, reignal year 27.

Several papyrus fragments, known as the Diary of Merer, were found at Khufu&#x27;s harbor at Wadi al-Jarf. They log the transport of limestone blocks from Tura to the Great Pyramid of Giza in the &quot;year after the 13th cattle count under Hor-Medjedw&quot;.

The highest known date from Khufu&#x27;s reign is related to his funeral. Four instances of graffiti from the western of two rock-cut pits along the south side of the Great Pyramid attest to a date from the 28th or 29th reignal year of Khufu: the 14th census, month 1 of the season Shemu (spring-early summer).

The Royal Canon of Turin from the 19th Dynasty, gives 23 years of rulership for Khufu. The ancient historian Herodotus gives 50 years, and the ancient historian Manetho even credits him 63 years of reign. These figures are now considered an exaggeration or a misinterpretation of antiquated sources.

=== Political activities ===
There are only a few hints about Khufu&#x27;s political activities within and outside Egypt. Within Egypt, Khufu is documented in several building inscriptions and statues. Khufu&#x27;s name appears in inscriptions at Elkab and Elephantine and in local quarries at Hatnub and Wadi Hammamat. At Saqqara two terracotta figures of the goddess Bastet were found, on which, at their bases, the horus name of Khufu is incised. They were deposited at Saqqara during the Middle Kingdom, but their creation can be dated back to Khufu&#x27;s reign.

==== Wadi Maghareh ====

At Wadi Maghareh in the Sinai a rock inscription depicts Khufu with the double crown. Khufu sent several expeditions in an attempt to find turquoise and copper mines. Like other kings, such as Sekhemkhet, Sneferu and Sahure, who are also depicted in impressive reliefs there, he was looking for those two precious materials. Khufu also entertained contacts with Byblos. He sent several expeditions to Byblos in an attempt to trade copper tools and weapons for precious Lebanon cedar wood. This kind of wood was essential for building large and stable funerary boats and indeed the boats discovered at the Great Pyramid were made of it.

==== Wadi al-Jarf ====
New evidence regarding political activities under Khufu&#x27;s reign has recently been found at the site of the ancient port of Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea coast in the east of Egypt. The first traces of such a harbour were excavated in 1823 by John Gardner Wilkinson and James Burton, but the site was quickly abandoned and then forgotten over time. In 1954, French scholars François Bissey and René Chabot-Morisseau re-excavated the harbour, but their works were brought to an end by the Suez Crisis in 1956. In June 2011, an archaeological team led by French Egyptologists Pierre Tallet and Gregory Marouard, organized by the French Institute of Oriental Archeology (&quot;IFAO&quot;), restarted work at the site. Among other material, a collection of hundreds of papyrus fragments were found in 2013 dating back 4,500 years. The papyrus is currently exhibited at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass called this ancient papyrus “the greatest discovery in Egypt in the 21st century.”

Ten of these papyri are very well preserved. The majority of these documents date to the 27th year of Khufu&#x27;s reign and describe how the central administration sent food and supplies to the sailors and wharf workers. The dating of these important documents is secured by phrases typical for the Old Kingdom period, as well as the fact that the letters are addressed to the king himself, using his Horus name. This was typical when the king in question was still alive; when the ruler was dead he was addressed by his cartouche name or birth name. One document is of special interest: the diary of Merer, an official involved in the building of the Great Pyramid. Using the diary, researchers were able to reconstruct three months of his life, providing new insight into the everyday lives of people of the Fourth Dynasty. These papyri are the earliest examples of imprinted papyri ever found in Egypt. Another inscription, found on the limestone walls of the harbor, mentions the head of the royal scribes controlling the exchange of goods: &quot;Idu&quot;.

Khufu&#x27;s cartouche name is also inscribed on some of the heavy limestone blocks at the site. The harbor was of strategic and economic importance to Khufu because ships brought precious materials, such as turquoise, copper and ore from the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula. The papyri fragments show several storage lists naming the delivered goods. The papyri also mention a certain harbour at the opposite coast of Wadi al-Jarf, on the western shore of the Sinai Peninsula, where the ancient fortress Tell Ras Budran was excavated in 1960 by Gregory Mumford. The papyri and the fortress together reveal an explicit sailing route across the Red Sea for the very first time in history. It is the oldest archaeologically detected sailing route of Ancient Egypt. According to Tallet, the harbor could also have been one of the legendary high sea harbours of Ancient Egypt, from where expeditions to the infamous gold land Punt had started.

==Monuments and statues==
===Statues===

The only three-dimensional depiction of Khufu that has survived time nearly completely is a small and well restored ivory figurine known as the Khufu Statuette. It shows the king with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The king is seated on a throne with a short backrest, at the left side of his knees the Horus-name &quot;Medjedu&quot; is preserved, and, at the right side, a fragment of the lower part of the cartouche name &quot;Khnum-Khuf&quot; is visible. Khufu holds a flail in his left hand and his right hand rests together with his lower arm on his right upper leg. The artifact was found in 1903 by Flinders Petrie at Kom el-Sultan near Abydos. The figurine was found headless; according to Petrie, it was caused by an accident while digging. When Petrie recognized the importance of the find, he stopped all other work and offered a reward to any workman who could find the head. Three weeks later the head was found after intense sifting in a deeper level of the room rubble. 

Today the little statue is restored and on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo in room 32 under its inventory number &quot;JE 36143&quot;. Most Egyptologists believe the statuette is contemporary, but some scholars, such as Zahi Hawass, think that it was an artistic reproduction of the 26th dynasty. He argues that no building that clearly dates to the Fourth Dynasty was ever excavated at Kom el-Sultan or Abydos. Furthermore, he points out that the face of Khufu is unusually squat and chubby and shows no emotional expression. Hawass compared the facial stylistics with statues of contemporary kings, such as Sneferu, Khaefra and Menkaura. The faces of these three kings are of even beauty, slender and with a kindly expression—the clear result of idealistic motivations; they are not based on reality. The appearance of Khufu on the ivory statue instead looks like the artist did not care very much about professionalism or diligence.

He believes Khufu himself would never have allowed the display of such a comparatively sloppy work. And finally, Hawass also argues that the sort of throne the figurine sits on does not match the artistic styles of any Old Kingdom artifact. Old Kingdom thrones had a backrest that reached up to the neck of the king. But the ultimate proof that convinces Hawass about the statue being a reproduction of much later time is the &quot;Nehenekh&quot; flail in Khufu&#x27;s left hand. Depictions of a king with such a flail as a ceremonial insignia appear no earlier than the Middle Kingdom. Zahi Hawass therefore concludes that the figurine was possibly made as an amulet or lucky charm to sell to pious citizens.

Deitrich Wildung has examined the representation of Nubian features in Egyptian iconography since the predynastic era and has argued that Khufu had these specific, Nubian features and this was represented in his statues.

 Excavations at Saqqara in 2001 and 2003 revealed a pair of terracotta statues depicting a lion goddess (possibly Bastet or Sekhmet). On her feet two figures of childlike kings are preserved. While the right figurine can be identified as king Khufu by his Horus name, the left one depicts king Pepy I of 6th dynasty, called by his birth name. The figurines of Pepy were added to the statue groups in later times, because they were placed separately and at a distance from the deity.

This is inconsistent with a typical statue group of the Old Kingdom—normally all statue groups were built as an artistic unit. The two statue groups are similar to each other in size and scale but differ in that one lion goddess holds a scepter. The excavators point out that the statues were restored during the Middle Kingdom, after they were broken apart. However, it seems that the reason for the restoration lay more in an interest in the goddess, than in a royal cult around the king figures: their names were covered with gypsum.

The Palermo Stone reports on its fragment &quot;C-2&quot; the creation of two oversize standing statues for the king; one is said to have been made of copper, the other of pure gold.

Furthermore, several alabaster and travertine fragments of seated statues, which were found by George Reisner during his excavations at Giza, were once inscribed with Khufu&#x27;s full royal titulary. Today, the complete or partially preserved cartouches with the name &quot;Khufu&quot; or &quot;Khnum-Khuf&quot; remain. One of the fragments, that of a small seated statue, shows the legs and feet of a sitting king from the knuckles downward. To the right of them the name &quot;...fu&quot; in a cartouche is visible, and it can easily be reconstructed as the cartouche name &quot;Khufu&quot;.

Two further objects are on display at the Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum Hildesheim. These are also made of alabaster. One of them shows the head of a cat goddess (most probably Bastet or Sekhmet). The position of her right arm suggests that the bust once belonged to a statue group similar to the well-known triad of Mycerinus.

Several statue heads might have belonged to Khufu. One of them is the so-called &quot;Brooklyn head&quot; of the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. It is 54.3 cm large and made of pink granite. Because of its chubby cheeks the head is assigned to Khufu as well as to king Huni. A similar object is on display at the State Collection of Egyptian Art in Munich. The head is made of limestone and is comparatively small at only 5.7 cm.
=== Reliefs ===
Khufu is depicted in several relief fragments found scattered in his necropolis and elsewhere. All reliefs were made of finely polished limestone. Some of them originate from the ruined pyramid temple and the destroyed causeway, where they once covered the walls completely. Others were found re-used in the pyramid necropolis of king Amenemhet I at Lisht and at Tanis and Bubastis. One of the relief fragments shows the cartouche of Khufu with the phrase: &quot;Building of the sanctuaries of the gods&quot;. Another one shows a row of fat oxen decorated with flowers—they were prepared as sacrifices during an offering procession. The guiding inscription calls them &quot;the surroundings of &quot;Tefef&quot; serve Khufu&quot;, &quot;beautiful bulls of Khufu&quot; and &quot;bawling for Khufu&quot;. A third one shows the earliest known depiction of royal warfare: the scene is called &quot;archers prepare&quot;, since it shows archers drawing their bows. And a fourth example shows the king with the double crown impaling a hippopotamus.

At the Wadi Maghareh in Sinai a rock inscription contains Khufu&#x27;s names and titles and reports: &quot;&quot;Hor-Medjedu, Khnum-Khuf, Bikuj-Nebu&quot;, the great god and smiter of the troglodytes, all protection and life are with him&quot;. The work-off of the relief is similar to that of king Snefru. In one scene king Khufu wears the double-crown; nearby, the depiction of the god Thoth is visible. In another scene, close by, Khufu wears the &quot;Atef&quot;-crown while smiting an enemy. In this scene the god Wepwawet is present.

None of the numerous relief fragments shows king Khufu offering to a god. This is remarkable, since reliefs of Sneferu and those of all kings from Menkaura onward show the king offering to a deity. It is possible that the lack of this special depiction influenced later ancient Greek historians in their assumptions that Khufu could have actually closed all temples and prohibited any sacrifice.

===Pyramid complex===


The pyramid complex of Khufu was erected in the northeastern section of the plateau of Giza. It is possible that the lack of building space, the lack of local limestone quarries and the loosened ground at Dahshur forced Khufu to move north, away from the pyramid of his predecessor Sneferu. Khufu chose the high end of a natural plateau so that his future pyramid would be widely visible. Khufu decided to call his pyramid &quot;Akhet-Khufu&quot; (meaning &quot;horizon of Khufu&quot;).

The Great Pyramid has a base measurement of ca. 750 x 750 ft (≙ 230.4 x 230.4 m) and today a height of . Once it had been high, but the pyramidion and the limestone casing are completely lost due to stone robbery. The lack of the casing allows a full view of the inner core of the pyramid. It was erected in small steps by more or less roughly hewn blocks of dark limestone. The casing was made of nearly white limestone. The outer surface of the casing stones were finely polished so the pyramid shimmered in bright, natural lime-white when new. The pyramidion might have been covered in electrum, but there is no archaeological proof of that. The inner corridors and chambers have walls and ceilings made of polished granite, one of the hardest stones known in Khufu&#x27;s time. The mortar used was a mixture of gypsum, sand, pulverized limestone and water.

The original entrance to the pyramid is on the northern side. Inside the pyramid are three chambers: at the top is the burial chamber of the king (the &quot;king&#x27;s chamber&quot;), in the middle is the statue chamber (erroneously called the &quot;queen&#x27;s chamber&quot;), and under the foundation is an unfinished subterranean chamber (&quot;underworld chamber&quot;). Whilst the burial chamber is identified by its large sarcophagus made of granite, the use of the &quot;queen&#x27;s chamber&quot; is still disputed—it might have been the serdab of the &quot;Ka&quot; statue of Khufu. The subterranean chamber remains mysterious as it was left unfinished. 

A tight corridor heading south at the western end of the chamber and an unfinished shaft at the eastern middle might indicate that the subterranean chamber was the oldest of the three chambers and that the original building plan contained a simple chamber complex with several rooms and corridors. But for unknown reasons the works were stopped and two further chambers were built inside the pyramid. Remarkable is the so-called &quot;Grand Gallery&quot; leading to the king&#x27;s chamber: It has a corbelled arch ceiling and measures in height and in length. The gallery has an important static function; it diverts the weight of the stone mass above the king&#x27;s chamber into the surrounding pyramid core.

Khufu&#x27;s pyramid was surrounded by an enclosure wall, with each segment in distance from the pyramid. On the eastern side, directly in front of the pyramid, Khufu&#x27;s mortuary temple was built. Its foundation was made of black basalt, a great part of which is still preserved. Pillars and portals were made of red granite and the ceiling stones were of white limestone. Today nothing remains but the foundation. From the mortuary temple a causeway 0.43 miles long once connected to the valley temple. The valley temple was possibly made of the same stones as the mortuary temple, but since even the foundation is not preserved, the original form and size of the valley temple remain unknown.

On the eastern side of the pyramid lies the &quot;East Cemetery&quot; of the Khufu necropolis, containing the mastabas of princes and princesses. Three small satellite pyramids, belonging to the queens &quot;Hetepheres&quot; (G1-a), &quot;Meritites I&quot; (G1-b) and possibly &quot;Henutsen&quot; (G1-c) were erected at the southeast corner of Khufu&#x27;s pyramid. Close behind the queens&#x27; pyramids G1-b and G1-c, the cult pyramid of Khufu was found in 2005. On the southern side of the Great Pyramid lie some further mastabas and the pits of the funerary boats of Khufu. On the western side lies the &quot;West Cemetery&quot;, where the highest officials and priests were interred.

A possible part of Khufu&#x27;s funerary complex is the famous Great Sphinx of Giza. It is a large limestone statue in the shape of a recumbent lion with the head of a human, decorated with a royal &quot;Nemes&quot; headdress. The Sphinx was directly hewn out of the plateau of Giza and originally painted with red, ochre, green and black. To this day it is passionately disputed as to who exactly gave the order to build it: the most probable candidates are Khufu, his elder son Djedefra and his younger son Khaefra. One of the difficulties of a correct attribution lies in the lack of any perfectly preserved portrait of Khufu. The faces of Djedefre and Khaefra are both similar to that of the Sphinx, but they do not match perfectly. Another riddle is the original cultic and symbolic function of the Sphinx. Much later it was called &quot;Heru-im-Akhet&quot; (&quot;Hârmachís&quot;; &quot;Horus at the horizon&quot;) by the Egyptians and &quot;Abu el-Hὀl&quot; (&quot;father of terror&quot;) by the Arabians. It might be that the Sphinx, as an allegoric and mystified representation of the king, simply guarded the sacred cemetery of Giza.

== Khufu in later Egyptian traditions ==
=== Old Kingdom ===
Khufu possessed an extensive mortuary cult during the Old Kingdom. At the end of 6th dynasty at least 67 mortuary priests and 6 independent high officials serving at the necropolis are archaeologically attested. Ten of them were already serving during the late 4th dynasty (seven of them were royal family members), 28 were serving during the 5th dynasty and 29 during the 6th dynasty. This is remarkable: Khufu&#x27;s famous (step-)father Sneferu enjoyed &quot;only&quot; 18 mortuary priesthoods during the same period of time, even Djedefra enjoyed only 8 and Khaefra enjoyed 28. Such mortuary cults were very important for the state&#x27;s economy, because for the oblations special domains had to be established. A huge number of domains&#x27; names are attested for the time of Khufu&#x27;s reign. However, by the end of the 6th dynasty the number of domains abated quickly. With the beginning of the 7th dynasty no domain&#x27;s name was handed down any more.

=== Middle Kingdom ===
At Wadi Hammamat a rock inscription dates back to the 12th dynasty. It lists five cartouche names: &quot;Khufu, Djedefra, Khafra, Baufra&quot; and &quot;Djedefhor&quot;. Because all royal names are written inside cartouches, it was often believed that Baufra and Djedefhor once had ruled for short time, but contemporary sources entitle them as mere princes. Khufu&#x27;s attendance roll call in this list might indicate that he and his followers were worshipped as patron saints. This theory is promoted by findings such as alabaster vessels with Khufu&#x27;s name found at Koptos, the pilgrimage destination of Wadi Hammamat travellers.

A literary masterpiece from the 13th dynasty talking about Khufu is the famous Papyrus Westcar, where king Khufu witnesses a magical wonder and receives a prophecy from a magician named Dedi. Within the story, Khufu is characterised in a difficult-to-assess way. On one hand, he is depicted as ruthless when deciding to have a condemned prisoner decapitated to test the alleged magical powers of Dedi. On the other hand, Khufu is depicted as inquisitive, reasonable and generous: He accepts Dedi&#x27;s outrage and his subsequent alternative offer for the prisoner, questions the circumstances and contents of Dedi&#x27;s prophecy and rewards the magician generously after all. The contradictory depiction of Khufu is the subject of great dispute between Egyptologists and historians to this day. Especially earlier Egyptologists and historians such as Adolf Erman, Kurt Heinrich Sethe and Wolfgang Helck evaluated Khufu&#x27;s character as heartless and sacrilegious. They leaned on the ancient Greek traditions of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, who described an exaggerated negative character image of Khufu, ignoring the paradoxical (because positive) traditions the Egyptians themselves had always taught.

But other Egyptologists, such as Dietrich Wildung, see Khufu&#x27;s order as an act of mercy: the prisoner would have received his life back if Dedi had actually performed his magical trick. Wildung thinks that Dedi&#x27;s refusal was an allusion to the respect Egyptians showed to human life. The ancient Egyptians were of the opinion that human life should not be misused for dark magic or similar evil things. Verena Lepper and Miriam Lichtheim suspect that a difficult-to-assess depiction of Khufu was exactly what the author had planned. He wanted to create a mysterious character.

=== New Kingdom ===
During the New Kingdom the necropolis of Khufu and the local mortuary cults were reorganized and Giza became an important economic and cultic destination again. During the Eighteenth Dynasty king Amenhotep II erected a memorial temple and a royal fame stele close to the Great Sphinx. His son and throne follower Thutmose IV freed the Sphinx from sand and placed a memorial stele—known as the &quot;Dream Stele&quot;—between its front paws. The two steles&#x27; inscriptions are similar in their narrative contents, but neither of them gives specific information about the true builder of the Great Sphinx.

At the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty a temple for the goddess Isis was built at the satellite pyramid &quot;G1-c&quot; (that of queen Henutsen) at Khufu&#x27;s necropolis. During the Twenty-first Dynasty the temple got extended, and, during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, the extensions continued. From this period of time several &quot;priests of Isis&quot; (&quot;Hem-netjer-Iset&quot;), who were also &quot;priests of Khufu&quot; (&quot;Hem-netjer-Khufu&quot;), worked there. From the same dynasty a golden seal ring with the name of a priest &quot;Neferibrê&quot; was found at Giza.

=== Late Period ===
During the Late Period huge numbers of scarabs with the name of Khufu were sold to the citizens, possibly as some kind of lucky charms. More than 30 scarabs are preserved. At Isis&#x27; temple a family tree of the Isis priests is on display, which lists the names of priests from 670 to 488 BC. From the same period comes the famous Inventory Stela, which names Khufu and his wife Henutsen. However, modern Egyptologists question whether Khufu was still personally adored as a royal ancestor at this time; they think it more likely that Khufu was already seen as a mere symbolic foundation figure for the history of the Isis temple.

== Khufu in ancient Greek traditions ==
=== Manetho ===
The later Egyptian historian Manetho called Khufu &quot;Sûphis&quot; and credited him with a rulership of 63 years. He also mentions that Khufu built the Great Pyramid, then he claims that his contemporary Herodotus says that the pyramid was built by a king &quot;Khéops&quot;. Manetho thought &quot;Khéops&quot; and &quot;Sûphis&quot; to be two different kings. Manetho also says that Khufu received a contempt against the gods and that he had written a sacred book about that and that he (Manetho) received that book during his travel through Egypt. The story about the alleged &quot;Sacred Book&quot; is questioned by modern Egyptologists, for it would be highly unusual that a pharaoh wrote books and that such a precious document could be sold away so easily.

=== Herodotus ===
The Greek historian Herodotus instead depicts Khufu as a heretic and cruel tyrant. In his literary work &quot;Historiae&quot;, Book II, chapter 124–126, he writes: &quot;As long as &quot;Rhámpsinîtos&quot; was king, as they told me, there was nothing but orderly rule in Egypt, and the land prospered greatly. But after him &quot;Khéops&quot; became king over them and brought them to every kind of suffering: He closed all the temples; after this he kept the priests from sacrificing there and then he forced all the Egyptians to work for him. So some were ordered to draw stones from the stone quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and others he forced to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to those called the Libyan mountains. And they worked by 100,000 men at a time, for each three months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid. For the length of it is 5 furlongs and the breadth 10 fathoms and the height, where it is highest, 8 fathoms, and it is made of polished stone and with figures carved upon it. For this, they said, 10 years were spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which he caused to be made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile.

For the making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of 20 years; and the pyramid is square, each side measuring 800 feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than 30 feet in length. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call &#x27;rows&#x27; and others &#x27;bases&#x27;: When they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with devices made of short pieces of timber, lifting them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However, that may be, the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges.

On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if I remember correctly what the interpreter said while reading this inscription for me, a sum of 1600 silver talents was spent. Kheops moreover came to such a pitch of evilness, that being in want of money he sent his own daughter to a brothel and ordered her to obtain from those who came a certain amount of money (how much it was they did not tell me). But she not only obtained the sum that was appointed by her father, but she also formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her a memorial: She requested each man who came in to her to give her one stone for her building project. And of these stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the three, each side being 150 feet in length.&quot;

The same goes for the story about king Khafre. He is depicted as the direct follower of Khufu and as likewise evil and that he ruled for 56 years. In chapter 127–128 Herodotus writes: &quot;After Khéops was dead his brother &quot;Khéphrên&quot; succeeded to the royal throne. This king followed the same manner as the other ... and ruled for 56 years. Here they reckon altogether 106 years, during which they say that there was nothing but evil for the Egyptians, and the temples were kept closed and not opened during all that time&quot;.

Herodotus closes the story of the evil kings in chapter 128 with the words: &quot;These kings the Egyptians (because of their hate against them) are not very willing to say their names. What&#x27;s more, they even call the pyramids after the name of &quot;Philítîs&quot; the shepherd, who at that time pastured flocks in those regions.&quot;

=== Diodorus of Sicily ===
The ancient historian Diodorus claims that Khufu was so much abhorred by his own people in later times that the mortuary priests secretly brought the royal sarcophagus, together with the corpse of Khufu, to another, hidden grave. With this narration he strengthens and confirms the view of the Greek scholars, that Khufu&#x27;s pyramid (and the other two, as well) must have been the result of slavery. However, at the same time, Diodorus distances himself from Herodotus and argues that Herodotus &quot;only tells fairy tales and entertaining fiction&quot;. Diodorus claims that the Egyptians of his lifetime were unable to tell him with certainty who actually built the pyramids. He also states that he did not really trust the interpreters and that the true builder might have been someone different: the Khufu pyramid was (according to him) built by a king named &quot;Harmais&quot;, the Khafre pyramid was thought to be built by king Amasis II and the Menkaura pyramid was allegedly the work of king Inaros I.

Diodorus states that the Khufu pyramid was beautifully covered in white, but the top was said to be capped. The pyramid therefore already had no pyramidion anymore. He also thinks that the pyramid was built with ramps, which were removed during the finishing of the limestone shell. Diodorus estimates that the total number of workers was 300,000 and that the building works lasted for 20 years.

== Khufu in Arabic traditions ==
In AD 642, the Arabs conquered Egypt. Upon arriving at the Giza pyramids, they searched for explanations as to who could have built these monuments. By this time, no inhabitant of Egypt was able to tell and no one could translate the Egyptian hieroglyphs anymore. As a consequence, the Arab historians wrote down their own theories and stories.

The best known story about Khufu and his pyramid can be found in the book &quot;Hitat&quot; (completely: &quot;al-Mawāʿiẓ wa-’l-iʿtibār fī ḏikr al-ḫiṭaṭ wa-’l-ʾāṯār&quot;), written in 1430 by Muhammad al-Maqrizi (1364–1442). This book contains several collected theories and myths about Khufu, especially about the Great Pyramid. Though King Khufu himself is seldom mentioned, many Arab writers were convinced that the Great Pyramid (and the others, too) were built by the god Hermes (named &quot;Idris&quot; by the Arabs).

Al-Maqrizi notes that Khufu was named &quot;Saurid&quot;, &quot;Salhuk&quot; and/or &quot;Sarjak&quot; by the biblical Amalekites. Then he writes that Khufu built the pyramids after repeated nightmares in which the earth turned upside-down, the stars fell down and people were screaming in terror. Another nightmare showed the stars falling down from heaven and kidnapping humans, then putting them beneath two large mountains. King Khufu then received a warning from his prophets about a devastating deluge that would come and destroy Egypt. To protect his treasures and books of wisdom, Khufu built the three pyramids of Giza.

== Modern egyptological evaluations ==
Over time, Egyptologists examined possible motives and reasons as to how Khufu&#x27;s reputation changed over time. Closer examinations of and comparisons between contemporary documents, later documents and Greek and Coptic readings reveal that Khufu&#x27;s reputation changed slowly, and that the positive views about the king still prevailed during the Greek and Ptolemaic era. Alan B. Lloyd, for example, points to documents and inscriptions from the 6th dynasty listing an important town called &quot;Menat-Khufu&quot;, meaning &quot;nurse of Khufu&quot;. This town was still held in high esteem during the Middle Kingdom period. Lloyd is convinced that such a heart-warming name wouldn&#x27;t have been chosen to honour a king with a bad (or, at least, questionable) reputation. Furthermore, he points to the overwhelming number of places where mortuary cults for Khufu were practiced, even outside Giza. These mortuary cults were still practiced even in Saitic and Persian periods.

The famous Lamentation Texts from the First Intermediate Period reveal some interesting views about the monumental tombs from the past; they were at that time seen as proof of vanity. However, they give no hint of a negative reputation of the kings themselves, and thus they do not judge Khufu in a negative way.

Modern Egyptologists evaluate Herodotus&#x27;s and Diodorus&#x27;s stories as some sort of defamation, based on both authors&#x27; contemporary philosophy. They call for caution against the credibility of the ancient traditions. They argue that the classical authors lived around 2,000 years after Khufu, and their sources that were available in their lifetimes surely were antiquated. Additionally some Egyptologists point out that the philosophies of the ancient Egyptians had changed since the Old Kingdom. Oversized tombs such as the Giza pyramids must have appalled the Greeks and even the later priests of the New Kingdom, because they remembered the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten and his megalomaniac building projects. 

This negative picture was presumably projected onto Khufu and his pyramid. The view was possibly promoted by the fact that during Khufu&#x27;s lifetime, permission for the creation of oversized statues made of precious stone and their displaying in public was limited to the king. In their era, the Greek authors, mortuary priests, and temple priests could only explain the impressive monuments and statues of Khufu as the result of a megalomaniac. These negative evaluations were applied to Khufu.

Furthermore, several Egyptologists point out that Roman historians such as Pliny the Elder and Frontinus (both around AD 70) equally do not hesitate to ridicule the pyramids of Giza: Frontinus calls them &quot;idle pyramids, containing the indispensable structures likewise to some of our abandoned aqueducts at Rome&quot; and Pliny describes them as &quot;the idle and foolish ostentation of royal wealth&quot;. Egyptologists clearly see politically and socially motivated intentions in these criticisms and it seems paradoxical that the use of these monuments was forgotten, but the names of their builders remained immortalized.

Another hint to Khufu&#x27;s bad reputation within the Greek and Roman folk might be hidden in the Coptic reading of Khufu&#x27;s name. The Egyptian hieroglyphs forming the name &quot;Khufu&quot; are read in Coptic as &quot;Shêfet&quot;, which actually would mean &quot;bad luck&quot; or &quot;sinful&quot; in their language. The Coptic reading derives from a later pronunciation of &quot;Khufu&quot; as &quot;Shufu&quot;, which in turn led to the Greek reading &quot;Suphis&quot;. Possibly the bad meaning of the Coptic reading of &quot;Khufu&quot; was unconsciously copied by the Greek and Roman authors.

On the other hand, some Egyptologists think that the ancient historians received their material for their stories not only from priests, but from the citizens living close to the time of the building of the necropolis. Among the &quot;simple folk&quot;, also, negative or critical views about the pyramids might have been handed down, and the mortuary cult of the priests was surely part of tradition. Additionally a long-standing literary tradition does not prove popularity. Even if Khufu&#x27;s name survived within the literary traditions for so long, different cultural circles surely fostered different views about Khufu&#x27;s character and historical deeds. The narrations of Diodorus, for example, are credited with more trust than those of Herodotus, because Diodorus collected the tales with much more scepsis. The fact that Diodorus credits the Giza pyramid to Greek kings, might be reasoned in legends of his lifetimes and that the pyramids were demonstrably reused in late periods by Greek and Roman kings and noblemen.

Modern Egyptologists and historians also call for caution about the credibility of the Arabian stories. They point out that medieval Arabs were guided by the strict Islamic belief that only one god exists, and therefore no other gods were allowed to be mentioned. As a consequence, they transferred Egyptian kings and gods into biblical prophets and kings. The Egyptian god Thoth, named &quot;Hermes&quot; by the Greeks, for example, was named after the prophet Henoch. King Khufu, as already mentioned, was named &quot;Saurid&quot;, &quot;Salhuk&quot; and/or &quot;Sarjak&quot;, and often replaced in other stories by a prophet named &quot;Šaddād bīn &#x27;Âd&quot;. Furthermore, scholars point to several contradictions which can be found in Al-Maqrizi&#x27;s book. For example, in the first chapter of the Hitat, the Copts are said to have denied any intrusion of the Amalekites in Egypt and the pyramids were erected as the tomb of Šaddād bīn &#x27;Âd. But some chapters later, Al-Maqrizi claims that the Copts call Saurid the builder of the pyramids.

==Khufu in popular culture==
Because of his fame, Khufu is the subject of several modern references, similar to kings and queens such as Akhenaten, Nefertiti and Tutankhamen. His historical figure appears in movies, novels and documentaries. In 1827, Jane C. Loudon wrote the novel &quot;The Mummy! A Tale of the 22nd Century&quot;. The story describes the citizens of the 22nd century, which became highly advanced technologically, but totally immoral. Only the mummy of Khufu can save them. In 1939, Nagib Mahfuz wrote the novel &quot;Khufu&#x27;s Wisdom&quot;, which is based on the stories of Papyrus Westcar. 

In 1997, French author Guy Rachet published the novel series &quot;Le roman des pyramides&quot;, including five volumes, of which the first two (&quot;Le temple soleil&quot; and &quot;Rêve de pierre&quot;) use Khufu and his tomb as a theme. In 2004, spiritualist Page Bryant published the novel &quot;The Second Coming of the Star Gods&quot;, which deals with Khufu&#x27;s alleged celestial origin. The novel &quot;The Legend of The Vampire Khufu&quot;, published by Raymond Mayotte in 2010, deals with king Khufu awakening in his pyramid as a vampire.

Films which deal with Khufu, or have the Great Pyramid as a subject, include Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot; from 1955, a fictional account of the building of the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Stargate&quot; from 1994, in which an extraterrestrial device is found near the pyramids.

Khufu and his pyramid are the subject of pseudoscientific theories purporting that Khufu&#x27;s pyramid was built with the help of extraterrestrials and that Khufu simply seized and re-used the monument, ignoring archaeological evidence or even falsifying it.

A near-Earth asteroid bears Khufu&#x27;s name: &quot;3362 Khufu&quot;.

Khufu and his pyramid are referenced in several computer games such as &quot;Tomb Raider – The Last Revelation&quot;, in which the player must enter Khufu&#x27;s pyramid and face the god Seth as the final boss. Another example is &quot;Duck Tales 2&quot; for the Game Boy; the player here must guide Uncle Scrooge through a trap-loaded Khufu&#x27;s pyramid. In the classic action role playing game Titan Quest, the Giza Plateau is a large desert region in Egypt, where the tomb of Khufu and the Great Sphinx can be found. He is also mentioned in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;, where the player can find his tomb.

<text>The Year of the Three Emperors, or the Year of the Three Kaisers (), refers to the year 1888 during the German Empire in German history. The year is considered to have memorable significance because of the deaths of two German Emperors, or Kaisers, leading to a rapid succession of three monarchs within one year. The three different emperors who ruled over Germany during this year were Wilhelm I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. The mnemonic &quot;&quot; (English: &quot;three eights, three emperors&quot;) is still used today in Germany by children and adults alike to learn the year in question.

==Situation==
Following the death of Frederick William IV in 1861, Wilhelm I became King of Prussia. As the monarch of the largest German state which had a key role in the unification, due largely to Bismarck&#x27;s efforts, Emperor Wilhelm I had ruled over the German Empire ever since the unification of Germany on 18 January 1871. He lived until he was almost 91 years old and reigned over Prussia for 27 years and over Germany for 17 years. His son, Crown Prince Frederick William, was celebrated for his military actions because of his leadership during the wars fought to unify Germany. Frederick commanded staffs and armies during the Second Schleswig War, the Austro-Prussian War, and the Franco-Prussian War. Crown Prince Frederick William had just turned 56 before the year 1888. Frederick also had a number of children at the time, and his heir-apparent was named Wilhelm, after his grandfather. Wilhelm turned 29 in January 1888.

==Rapid succession==
Emperor Wilhelm I died on 9 March 1888 after his long reign. He was then succeeded by his son, Frederick William. Frederick William became known as Frederick III when he assumed the throne. Along with his military successes, Frederick III was a reputed liberal and married to the United Kingdom&#x27;s liberal Princess Royal Victoria. However, by the time of his father&#x27;s death, Frederick was 56 years old and had already developed a terminal case of cancer of the larynx before he assumed the German imperial throne. Frederick attempted to have it treated, but it was not successful. Due to this illness and subsequent treatment, Frederick could not talk during his short reign and had to communicate through writing. Frederick still accomplished some of his duties as emperor despite his protracted illness; however, he did not have any lasting effect upon Germany. He died after only 99 days of rule on 15 June 1888. Frederick&#x27;s son, Wilhelm II, then succeeded to the throne at age 29. Unlike his father, Wilhelm II did not have many liberal tendencies. Wilhelm II eventually led Germany into World War I and ruled until his abdication and the fall of the German Empire in 1918 at the end of war.

<text>Olsen Brothers () were a Danish rock/pop music duo, formed by brothers Jørgen (born 15 March 1950) and Niels &quot;Noller&quot; Olsen (born 13 April 1954), both from Odense, who won the Eurovision Song Contest 2000. They formed their first band, The Kids, in 1965. The Kids warmed up for The Kinks in the K.B. Hallen in 1965 and released their first single in 1967.

==Career==
Both Jørgen and Niels Olsen participated in the musical &quot;Hair&quot; at the Cirkusbygningen in Copenhagen in March 1971, and went on tour afterwards throughout Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

The Olsen Brothers&#x27; first album was released in 1972; in total they have released 13 albums. Some of the biggest hit singles include &quot;Angelina&quot; (1972), &quot;For What We Are&quot; (1973), &quot;Julie&quot; (1977), &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1978), &quot;Dans Dans Dans&quot; (1979), &quot;Marie, Marie&quot; (1982), &quot;Neon Madonna&quot; (1985), &quot;Wings Of Love&quot; (2000), &quot;We Believe In Love&quot; (2001), &quot;Look Up Look Down&quot; (performed with Cliff Richard) (2009) and &quot;Brothers To Brothers&quot; (2013).

The Olsen Brothers have sold approximately 3.2 million albums, 1.5 million singles and 2.7 million compilations.
They have a two-voice harmony, and among their “fans&quot; are Cliff Richard and Björn Ulvaeus, who both call the Olsen Brothers the &quot;European Everly Brothers&quot;.

===Dansk Melodi Grand Prix and Eurovision participation===
The Olsen Brothers, and, on occasion, Jørgen Olsen on his own, took part in a number of annual competitions known as Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, the winner of which would represent Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest.

====DMGP 2000 and Eurovision Song Contest 2000====
They won the annual Dansk Melodi Grand Prix song competition in 2000 in Copenhagen, and went on to represent Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 in Stockholm. where they won with the song &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot; (translated from the Danish &quot;Smuk som et Stjerneskud&quot; (literally translated as &quot;Beautiful as a Shooting Star&quot;). At one stage, they sold 100,000 copies in one day in Denmark; they became the second Danish act to win the competition. On the day of their victory, Jørgen Olsen was 50 years and 61 days of age, making him the oldest artist to win the contest. However, he only held the record for one year, as Dave Benton triumphed in 2001 at the age of 50 years and 101 days. The combined ages of The Olsen Brothers make them the oldest aged act ever to win the contest.

They opened the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 in Copenhagen with a short reprise of their winning song from the previous year, followed by a full performance of their new release, &quot;Walk Right Back&quot;.

====Later years====
In 2005 for the first time since their victory, they re-entered the Danish Melodi Grand Prix, the national pre-selection for the Eurovision contest, with the song &quot;Little Yellow Radio&quot;. It was widely reported that they hoped to repeat their triumph; however, this time they had to settle for second place, finishing behind Jakob Sveistrup.

Their song &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot; was nominated as one of the 14 finalists for Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest, held in Copenhagen, Denmark on 22 October 2005. They performed the song at the event, finishing 6th overall from 14 songs. The winner was &quot;Waterloo&quot; by ABBA.

In 2019, the brothers called a hiatus to their musical career after Niels was diagnosed with brain cancer. However, Niels was declared cancer-free by the end of 2020, in a development that was described as &quot;against the odds&quot;. He has not ruled out returning to music in the future.

<doc id="242617" wikidata="Q1131696" url="?curid=242617" title="Rite of passage">
<text>A rite of passage is a ceremony or ritual of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of status in society. In cultural anthropology the term is the Anglicisation of &quot;rite de passage&quot;, a French term innovated by the ethnographer Arnold van Gennep in his work &quot;Les rites de passage&quot;, &quot;The Rites of Passage&quot;. The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.

== Original conception ==
In English, Van Gennep&#x27;s first sentence of his first chapter begins:

&quot;Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups.&quot;

The population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, &quot;as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors.&quot; A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.

Van Gennep further distinguishes between &quot;the secular&quot; and &quot;the sacred sphere.&quot; Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent &quot;the simplest level of development,&quot; he hypothesizes that &quot;social groups in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations.&quot; Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase. Passage between these groups requires a ceremony, or ritual rite of passage.

The rest of Van Gennep&#x27;s book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all: &quot;It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ...&quot; He is able to find some universals, mainly two: &quot;the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred.&quot; (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.

==Stages==
Rites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. &quot;I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, &quot;preliminal rites&quot;, those executed during the transitional stage &quot;liminal (or threshold) rites&quot;, and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world &quot;postliminal rites&quot;.&quot;

In the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. &quot;The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.&quot; There is often a detachment or &quot;cutting away&quot; from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is &quot;cutting away&quot; the former self: the civilian.

The transition (liminal) phase is the period between stages, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. &quot;The attributes of liminality or of liminal &quot;personae&quot; (&quot;threshold people&quot;) are necessarily ambiguous.&quot;

In the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject.&quot; Having completed the rite and assumed their &quot;new&quot; identity, one re-enters society with one&#x27;s new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus &quot;in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the &#x27;sacred bond&#x27;, the &#x27;sacred cord&#x27;, the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown.&quot;

==Psychological effects==
Laboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce cognitive dissonance. It is theorized that such dissonance heightens group attraction among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used. Rewards during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity. As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce conformity among new members. Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of affiliation.

Aronson and Mills tested the Festinger&#x27;s (1957) theory of cognitive dissonance by having three groups read either embarrassing material, not very embarrassing material, or nothing at all to a group. Aronson and Mills summarized Festinger&#x27;s theory of cognitive dissonance as such when discussing the rationale for their study: &quot;No matter how attractive a group is to a person it is rarely completely positive, i.e., usually there are some aspects of the group that the individual does not like. If he has undergone an unpleasant initiation to gain admission to the group, his cognition that he has gone through an unpleasant experience for the sake of membership is dissonant with his cognition that there are things about the group that he does not like. He can reduce this dissonance in two ways. He can convince himself that the initiation was not very unpleasant, or he can exaggerate the positive characteristics of the group and minimize its negative aspects. With increasing severity of initiation it becomes more and more difficult to believe that the initiation was not very bad. Thus, a person who has gone through a painful initiation to become a member of a group should tend to reduce his dissonance by over estimating the attractiveness of the group.&quot; Those who read the severely embarrassing material perceived the group as more attractive than those who read the mildly embarrassing material or nothing at all. Another study using mathematical subtraction tasks reached the opposite conclusion but research using electrical shocks supported the concept that suffering increased the degree to which participants liked the group.

==Cultural==

Initiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership. It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world. Initiation rites are &quot;a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body&quot;. These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship. In Zulu culture, entering womanhood is celebrated by the Umhlanga.

==Types and examples==
Rites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as &quot;Man Up Global&quot;. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. Adventure education programs, such as Outward Bound, have often been described as potential rites of passage. Pamela Cushing researched the rites of passage impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite of passage impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase. Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the &quot;Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage&quot; as a modern and weaker version of the rites of passage typically used by outdoor adventure programs.

There have been variations on this walk, such as seasons in which the remaining contestants paddle a boat to the final challenge and drop the torches into the ocean along the way.

<text>Rites of Passage is an African American History program sponsored by the Stamford, Connecticut US public schools. The program consists of an extra day of schooling on Saturday for 12 weeks, service projects, and a culminating educational trip to Gambia and Senegal, the ancestral homes of many African Americans. The highlight of the trip is a visit to Goree Island, and the Door of No Return. The Door of No Return symbolizes the last point of departure of African slaves being shipped to the Western Hemisphere. As Rodney Bass, the founder and director of the program describes it:

By passing through &quot;The Door of No Return&quot; the students invalidate the legacy of slavery and reconnect with the ancestral heritage, linking their past to their present. We have seen the positive changes in the educational performance of our alumni students, and also the greater impact they have had on our community and the possibilities for their future.

The program is open to 7th grade students. Students must apply and be accepted. Typical participation is 10 to 20 students.

The program was founded by Rodney Bass, a former principal in the Stamford school system. He was moved by his own first visit to West Africa. He and the other teachers who lead the program:

hypothesized that we can help produce healthier young people who now understand slavery was not their beginning, nor the principal means of defining the African-American experience, but instead a real, limited part of a legacy of faith, pride, and endurance that spans millennia.

The program is open to students of all races and heritages. 2010 marked its fifth anniversary.

<text>Łomża () is a city in north-eastern Poland, approximately to the north-east of Warsaw and west of Białystok. It is situated alongside the Narew river as part of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. It is the capital of Łomża County and has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Łomża since 1925.

Łomża is one of the principal economic, educational, and cultural centres of north-eastern Masovia as well as one of the three main cities of Podlaskie Voivodeship (beside Białystok and Suwałki). It lends its name to the protected area of Łomża Landscape Park. The town is also the location of the Łomża Brewery.

==History==
===Early history===

Łomża was founded in the 10th century, on the site of the present day village called Stara Łomża (&quot;Old Łomża&quot;). It was first mentioned in official records in the 14th century. Łomża received its municipal rights in 1416, and became an important political and economic center in the mid-16th century. Łomża was a royal city of Poland and the capital of the Łomża Land, an administrative unit (ziemia) of the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province until Poland lost its independence in 1795.

Polish Duke Bolesław IV the Curly built a palace there in the 12th century. In 1444 the town was granted an exemption from the transit tax on Narew river contributing to its further development. In the 16th century King Sigismund II Augustus gave Łomża the right to hold great fairs three times a year, similar to Warsaw and Płock. In 1614 the Jesuits founded a Jesuit College, which as today&#x27;s &quot;I Liceum Ogólnokształcące&quot; is among the oldest high schools in Poland. In 1618 a great fire destroyed most of the city, and six years later, an epidemic killed 5,021 persons decimating its population. A series of disasters (including the Swedish invasion and the Cossack raids) resulted in its rapid decline. The 3rd Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Łomża before the Third Partition of Poland.

===Late modern period===

As a result of the Partitions of Poland Łomża was annexed by Prussia in 1795. In 1807 it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, within which it was the seat of the Łomża Department. In 1815 Łomża became part of Congress Poland, which was forcibly integrated into the Russian Empire over the course of the 19th century. After the Russian massacres of Polish protesters in Warsaw in 1861, Polish demonstrations took place in Łomża, at which even romantic poet Władysław Syrokomla gave a public speech, however, they ended in October 1861 when the Russians imposed martial law. Afterwards the Polish resistance began preparations for an uprising. In 1863 the January Uprising broke out and many local Poles joined it. In July 1863, the Russians carried out a massacre of 50 unarmed young Poles in the nearby forest in Wygoda, mainly students of local schools, who joined the uprising. The victims were tortured and murdered in gruesome ways: some had their eyes gouged out, bones broken, or insides torn out before they died. From November 1863, the Russians carried out mass arrests and confiscations of Polish property, and many insurgents escaped from the country. Russians deported hundreds of Poles from the county to Katorga to Siberia, and Łomża was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents. At the place of the executions, Poles put up crosses several times, and the Russians removed them.
During World War I, the Russian administration was evacuated in June 1915, and the city was occupied by Germany from August 1915 until 1918. In 1916 the Poles finally erected a still preserved monument at the site of the Russian executions of Polish insurgents. In 1916–1917, the Polish Legions were stationed in the city. In 1917–1918, Łomża was the location of a German internment camp for soldiers of the Polish Legions. In November 1918, Poland regained independence, and the occupying German forces opened fire on Poles who tried to liberate the city, but it was still reintegrated with the reborn Polish state.

During the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–1921, the city was attacked by the Russians on July 29, 1920, and then it was defended by the Poles for a week. Łomża was directly in the path of the Russian army&#x27;s catastrophic retreat following its defeat at the Battle of Warsaw. On August 15, 1920, the Soviet General August Kork of the 15th Army mounted an unsuccessful defence of the town against the Polish Fourth Army of General Leonard Skierski, before continuing its retreat eastward under pressure from the Polish forces.

===World War II===

In September 1939, during the joint Soviet and German invasion of Poland, Łomża was largely destroyed by the Wehrmacht during the Battle of Łomża, and then was briefly occupied by Germany. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; entered Łomża in mid-September to commit various crimes against Poles. Germans carried out searches of Polish offices, organizations, and Catholic institutions, including the bishop&#x27;s seat and the Capuchin monastery, and banned preaching and the organization of meetings.

On September 26, 1939, a Soviet aircraft dropped anti-Polish propaganda leaflets, which stated that &quot;Poles are not capable of self-governing their country,&quot; so &quot;the Soviets come to take care of them out of mercy.&quot; Soon afterwards the city was turned over by the Germans to the Red Army, which entered on September 29 and was incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. The Soviets established a local station of the NKVD, and the Polish population was subjected to various repressions. In January 1940, the Soviets changed several street names, even calling one &quot;September 17 Street&quot;, after the day of the Soviet invasion of Poland. At least 32 Poles from Łomża were murdered by the Russians in the Katyn massacre in 1940. The Soviets carried out arrests of the Capuchin monks and expelled Benedictine nuns in mid-1940. According to Soviet data from September 1940, over 330 Polish families were deported from the district to the USSR. In 1941 the local Polish underground resistance movement was weakened when the Soviets arrested its commander. The Soviets held 2,128 people in the local prison as of June 21, 1941, the day before Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and on June 20–21 they carried out mass deportations of Poles to Russia. Łomża remained under Soviet control until Operation Barbarossa.
In June 1941, at the onset of the Russian campaign Łomża was captured by the Wehrmacht and used as a communications hub by the German forces. Hundreds of Poles, including those initially held in the local prison and local Polish intelligentsia, were murdered in large massacres in nearby villages of Sławiec, Jeziorko and Pniewo in 1942–1943. The Jewish population of Łomża, which numbered 9,000 at the beginning of the war, was almost entirely wiped out, murdered at a nearby forest or sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp to be murdered there. Only a few dozen survived. Since 1943, the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; carried out deportations of Poles including teenage boys from the local prison to the Stutthof concentration camp.

The Red Army fought back and successfully captured Łomża on September 13, 1944. Afterwards the city was restored to Poland.

===Recent period===
Between 1946 and 1975, the oldest part of the city was rebuilt. New housing estates came into existence along with several industrial plants, among them Łomża cotton and furniture factories and starch manufacturer PEPEES, as well as municipal thermal power station. The city transit system was also established during this time. By the beginning of the 1970s, the population had reached almost 30,000 inhabitants. It was the capital of the Łomża Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

==Jewish community==
References to Jewish residents in Łomża () date to 1494. The population numbers date back only to 1808, when 157 Jews were officially counted. A magnificent stone synagogue was built there in 1881 on the initiative of Rabbi Eliezer-Simcha Rabinowicz. The Great Synagogue designed by Enrico Marconi became a centre of the Zionist movement. The Lomza Yeshiva attracted hundreds of Orthodox Jewish students, founded in 1883. In 1931, there were 8,912 Jews who lived in the city.

World War I was especially hard on the Jewish community of Łomża, which was a major battle area against German military forces. In 1915, the Jewish Aid Society estimated that 22,000 Jewish residents of Łomża were made homeless from the war.

On October 29, 1941, German troops forced over 1,000 Jewish residents of Łomża to kneel in trenches, and they murdered them all with machine guns. They continued murdering entire families.

On 12 August 1941, a Łomża Ghetto was created in the vicinity of the Old Market Square (Stary Rynek). The Nazi Einsatzkommando under SS-Obersturmführer Hermann Schaper committed mass killings of alleged Soviet collaborators a few days later. The number of Jews herded into the Łomża Ghetto from surrounding villages and towns including Jedwabne, Stawiski, Piątnica, Rotki, Wizna, Łomża, and others, ranged from 10,000 to 18,000. Over two-thousand people were murdered in the Giełczyn Forest outside of town. Many Jews perished from malnutrition and diseases such as dysentery and typhus. The rest were shipped to Auschwitz. The Łomża synagogue was destroyed. The ghetto was liquidated in the final deportation action on 1 November 1942. Only a small number of the Jews of Łomża survived the Holocaust; some found refuge with Catholic Polish families.

At the end of 1944, the Red Army recaptured the territory. Following the Yalta Conference, the Soviets ceded the city to Poland, with its total population reduced to 12,500 inhabitants, none of whom were Jewish.

One of the only visible remnants of the city&#x27;s Jewish history is the Jewish cemetery. In 1999, the Łomża Jewish Cemetery Foundation was officially founded as a charity devoted to restoring the cemetery, showing respect to the deceased buried there, and to improve relations between Poles and Jews. Łomża declared the Jewish cemetery to be historical sites, and the city erected signed warning that any damage caused would be punishable under the Historical Site Preservation Law. The city also decided to install doors and replace the roof on one of the original cemetery&#x27;s buildings.

In the 1997, a Torah was discovered that had been hidden in a home in Łomża since World War II. The Torah was discovered while the home was being razed to build new housing. The Torah was bought by Gerald C. Bender, a man living in Illinois in the United States whose father had been born and raised in Łomża. Bender bought the Torah in order to donate it to a synagogue.

==Demographics==
Łomża is the third largest city in Podlaskie Voivodeship with 62,019 inhabitants as of 2021.

==Religion==
The inhabitants of Łomża are predominantly Roman Catholic, although over the centuries in addition to the Catholics, followers of other religions have settled there. There is evidence of many Jewish and Protestant gravestones at the Łomża cemeteries, particularly the two abandoned Jewish cemeteries.

==Education==
The history of education in Łomża dates back to the early 15th century, when the first parish was founded. In 1614, Jesuits residing in Łomża created a Collegium (present-day I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Tadeusza Kościuszki). One of its rectors was Andrew Bobola. The educational level has not decreased after the KEN school pijarom in 1774. Łomża has educated a number of dignitaries, among others: Szymon Konarski, Rafał Krajewski, Jakub Ignacy Weight, Wojciech Szweykowski, and Adam Chętnik.

Currently in Łomża there is a well-developed network of public and private schools at all levels. There are seven primary schools, eight schools, ten secondary schools, six universities (including three non-public) and two schools of art. The educational level in Łomża is high, based on the results of the exams and countrywide lists. For example, I Liceum Ogólnokształcące rates as a top national and central Poland school.

==Economy==

The economy of Łomża is closely connected to its natural environment, with agricultural and forestry industries at the forefront of the region&#x27;s economic development. The economy is ecologically friendly, including the food industries, brewing, electronics, the manufacture of building materials and furniture, the production and processing of agricultural crops, as well as tourism and agro-tourism. 
Even the largest companies employ less than 1,000 workers, even though a number of firms are listed on the Podlaskie Top One Hundred Entrepreneurs. Among them, the Łomża Brewery (large scale producer of beer), DOMEL (producer of unleaded windows), FARGOTEX (importer of upholstery fabrics), Konrad (importer of farm animals), Łomża furniture factory (Łomżyńska Fabryka Mebli), PEPEES (producer of potato starch), Purzeczko (the personal and property protection). On top of that, the city is a registered office of the Podlaskie Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture.

By the end of 2007, the number of people steadily employed in Łomża was 13,408, including 7,170 women, however, the unemployment rate () remained considerably high at 14.1 percent. The number of businesses registered by the end of 2008 was 6,421 of which 6,280 belonged to the private sector.

==Sports==

The history of sport in Łomża dates back to the end of the 19th century, when the first amateur races were held in 1897. Two years later, Łomża Rowing Society was established, and initiated its activities on January 26, 1902.

The first football club was founded on April 16, 1926, currently known as ŁKS Łomża. It is the city&#x27;s most successful football club, having played on the Polish second tier in the 1930s, 1940s, and 2000s.

There are several sports clubs in town including volleyball, basketball, athletics, and martial arts. The inhabitants of the town have been the most successful in athletics, sports fighting and bodybuilding. Sports in Łomża are supported by the Society for Promoting Physical Culture and the Łomża School Sports Association. In 1998, an indoor sports arena opened for national and international sporting events, including indoor football matches and martial arts tournaments.

In 2009, a contract was signed for the construction of a municipal swimming pool to open in 2011, which is the second such facility in the city.

<doc id="242621" wikidata="Q16368" url="?curid=242621" title="List of bones of the human skeleton">
<text>The human skeleton of an adult usually consists of around 206 bones, depending on the counting of Sternum (which may alternatively be included as the manubrium, body of sternum, and the xiphoid process). It is composed of 270 bones at the time of birth, but later decreases to 206: 80 bones in the axial skeleton and 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton. 172 of 206 bones are part of a pair and the remaining 34 are unpaired. Many small accessory bones, such as sesamoid bones, are not included in this. The precise count of bones can vary among individuals because of natural anatomical variations.

==Introduction==
As a person ages, some bones fuse, a process which typically lasts until sometime within the third decade of life. Therefore, the number of bones in an individual may be evaluated differently throughout a lifetime. In addition, the bones of the skull and face are counted as separate bones, despite being fused naturally. Some reliable sesamoid bones such as the pisiform are counted, while others, such as the hallux sesamoids, are not.

Individuals may have more or fewer bones than the average (even accounting for developmental stage) owing to anatomical variations. The most common variations include sutural (wormian) bones, which are located along the sutural lines on the back of the skull, and sesamoid bones which develop within some tendons, mainly in the hands and feet. Some individuals may also have additional (i.e., supernumerary) cervical ribs or lumbar vertebrae. Amputations or other injuries may result in the loss of bones. Complete bone fractures may split one bone into multiple pieces. Other genetic conditions may result in abnormally higher (e.g. polydactyly or conjoined twins) or lower (e.g. oligodactyly) counts of bones.

==Bones==
The axial skeleton, comprising the spine, chest and head, contains 80 bones. The appendicular skeleton, comprising the arms and legs, including the shoulder and pelvic girdles, contains 126 bones, bringing the total for the entire skeleton to 206 bones. Infants are born with about 270 bones with most of it being cartilage, but will later fuse together and decrease over time to 206 bones.

<doc id="242622" wikidata="Q7437939" url="?curid=242622" title="Scottish Republican Socialist Movement">
<text>The Scottish Republican Socialist Movement (SRSM) is a political organisation that was formed out of the now defunct Scottish Republican Socialist Party (SRSP), a political party that operated in Scotland.

The SRSM campaigns for Scottish independence at a grassroots level and through cross-party organisations like Independence First, and organises regular events, including the annual 1320 Declaration of Arbroath rally, the Glencoe rally, and the John MacLean commemoration. It publishes two magazines, called &quot;Scottish Worker&#x27;s Republic&quot; and &quot;Red Duster&quot;.

==History==

===Formation===
The Scottish Republican Socialist Clubs were formed in 1973 to introduce socialism to the Scottish National Party (SNP) and grow support for Scottish independence among the left. After the expulsion of the 79 Group from the SNP, the Republican Clubs decided to form a coherent political party and the Scottish Republican Socialist Party was created in 1982.

While agreeing with the SNP insofar that they believed in independence, the SRSP believed this should be combined with support for revolutionary socialism. They argued that independence is meaningless to the working class unless it is socialist, and adopted an abstentionist position towards UK general elections.

===Affiliation to the Scottish Socialist Party (1998–2006)===
In 1998, the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) was formed and the SRSP narrowly decided to join them, reforming as a cross-party movement called the Scottish Republican Socialist Movement. Many members ended up within the SSP, but not exclusively.

In December 2004, the SRSM was designated as a banned organisation by the SNP because of its affiliation with the Scottish Socialist Party. As a result, SNP members were no longer allowed to be members of the SRSM.

The SRSM was active in campaigning against attempts within the SSP to ditch the policy of supporting independence. It succeeded at persuading high-profile SSP members like Alan McCombes, Rosie Kane, and Kevin Williamson to speak at its rallies and for its cause. The SRSM twice attempted to entrench a commitment to Scottish independence in the SSP&#x27;s constitution.

In 2005, there were calls for the SRSM to be ejected from the SSP due to its vocal support for the Irish Republican Socialist Party and other Irish political groups that have been characterised as &quot;opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process&quot;. In the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, journalist Paul Hutcheon characterised the movement as having &quot;web-links to Irish terror groups&quot;. John Patrick, a member of the SRSM and the SSP&#x27;s animal rights spokesperson, insisted that the SRSM had no political links to organisations in Ireland but had a relationship &quot;based on solidarity in trying to break up the British state&quot;.

===Disaffiliation and later activity (2006–present)===
In October 2006, the SRSM announced that it was disaffiliating from the Scottish Socialist Party, citing unhappiness with unionist elements within the party and the failure of their third attempt to entrench a commitment to independence in the party constitution. The SRSM confirmed it would continue to operate as a cross-party organisation, and a &quot;minority&quot; of SRSM members remained part of the SSP.

In September 2012, the SRSM were banned from participating in the 2012 March and Rally for Scottish Independence in Edinburgh, because reports circulated by the Better Together campaign characterised the SRSM as &quot;a group who regularly burn Union flags, attack the Queen, glorify terrorism and advocate a violent Scottish revolution&quot;. The SRSM&#x27;s organiser, Donald Anderson, responded by stating the organisation &quot;do not have any intention of burning flags at the Edinburgh rally&quot;, and that: &quot;We will be there as individuals carrying Saltires, despite Unionist objections to our national flag. The Imperialist Union flag is not called the &#x27;butcher&#x27;s apron&#x27; for nothing.&quot;

The organisation reaffirmed and also updated its key values/demands at its Ard Fheis on Saturday 29 November 2014. The SRSM stands for:
*Independent Scottish Socialist Republic
*A Scotland that is nuclear free and out of NATO
*A democratic society based on a sustainable economy and workers&#x27; control.

The organisation is cross party and non-party and endeavours to work with all other organisations that share its goal of an independent Scotland.

The organisation organises a number of annual events including a republican Burns Night and commemorations at Glencoe, Arbroath and Bannockburn. Its main annual event however is the John Maclean March and Rally each November.

The Honorary President and Treasurer is Donald Anderson.

<doc id="242623" wikidata="Q241520" url="?curid=242623" title="Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann">
<text>Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann were Danish singers and musicians. Together they won the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix in 1963, and went on to represent Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 with the song &quot;Dansevise&quot; (&quot;Dancing tune&quot;) with music by Otto Francker and lyrics by Sejr Volmer-Sørensen. The song won the competition. No other Danish song would take first place in the Eurovision competition again until the year 2000 when the Olsen Brothers won with their song, &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot;, and again in 2013 when Emmelie de Forest won with the song &quot;Only Teardrops&quot;

Jørgen Ingmann was born on 26 April 1925 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Grethe Clemmensen was born on 17 June 1938 in Copenhagen, Denmark. They met in 1955, were married in 1956 and got divorced in 1975. Grethe Ingmann became the first Eurovision winner to die, which was because of cancer on 18 August 1990 in Denmark and Jørgen Ingmann died on 21 March 2015 in Denmark.

The US success of Jörgen Ingmann&#x27;s version of Jerry Lordan&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Apache&quot; (which hit no 1 in US Singles&#x27; list in 1961) was largely due to EMI&#x27;s omission to release The Shadows&#x27; original 1960 version in time in the US. The cover version of the Dane came first and The Shadows&#x27; hit could not keep up with it in the US. In subsequent years, Jerry Lordan wrote many other instrumental hits for The Shadows (&quot;Wonderful Land&quot;, Atlantis, Maroc 5). The Shadows could never really break through in the US, not even in the wave of the &quot;British Invasion&quot; in the mid-sixties.

<text>The trapezoid bone (lesser multangular bone) is a carpal bone in tetrapods, including humans. It is the smallest bone in the distal row of carpal bones that give structure to the palm of the hand. It may be known by its wedge-shaped form, the broad end of the wedge constituting the dorsal, the narrow end the palmar surface; and by its having four articular facets touching each other, and separated by sharp edges. It is homologous with the &quot;second distal carpal&quot; of reptiles and amphibians.

==Structure==
The trapezoid is a four-sided carpal bone found within the hand. The trapezoid is found within the distal row of carpal bones. 

===Surfaces===
The &quot;superior surface&quot;, quadrilateral, smooth, and slightly concave, articulates with the scaphoid.

The &quot;inferior surface&quot; articulates with the proximal end of the second metacarpal bone; it is convex from side to side, concave from before backward and subdivided by an elevated ridge into two unequal facets.

The &quot;dorsal&quot; and &quot;palmar surfaces&quot; are rough for the attachment of ligaments, the former being the larger of the two.

The &quot;lateral surface&quot;, convex and smooth, articulates with the trapezium.

The &quot;medial surface&quot; is concave and smooth in front, for articulation with the capitate; rough behind, for the attachment of an interosseous ligament.

==Function==
The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. 

==Clinical Significance==

Isolated fractures of the trapezoid are rare, representing 0.4% of the total, thus being the least common of all carpal fractures. This is due to the bone being in a fairly protected position. Distally, it forms a stable, relatively immobile joint with the second metacarpal, radially and proximally it forms strong ligaments with the trapezium and the capitate ulnarly, scaphoid respectively.

However, injury can occur through axial force applied to the second metacarpal base. Subluxations, such as ones caused by delivering a blow, are not uncommon. Direct trauma to the bone can also cause fracture.

Due to its rarity, standard treatment has not been established. A wide range of treatments are possible, including rest, surgery and casting.

==History==
The etymology derives from the Greek &quot;trapezion&quot; which means &quot;irregular quadrilateral,&quot; from &quot;tra-&quot; &quot;four&quot; and &quot;peza&quot; &quot;foot&quot; or &quot;edge.&quot; Literally, &quot;a little table&quot; from &quot;trapeza&quot; meaning &quot;table&quot; and &quot;-oeides&quot; &quot;shaped.&quot;

<text>In the human body, the cuboid bone is one of the seven tarsal bones of the foot.

==Structure==
The cuboid bone is the most lateral of the bones in the distal row of the tarsus. It is roughly cubical in shape, and presents a prominence in its inferior (or plantar) surface, the tuberosity of the cuboid. The bone provides a groove where the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle passes to reach its insertion in the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform bones.

===Surfaces===
The dorsal surface, directed upward and lateralward, is rough, for the attachment of ligaments.

The plantar surface presents in front a deep groove, the peroneal sulcus, which runs obliquely forward and medialward; it lodges the tendon of the peroneus longus, and is bounded behind by a prominent ridge, to which the long plantar ligament is attached.

The ridge ends laterally in an eminence, the tuberosity, the surface of which presents an oval facet; on this facet glides the sesamoid bone or cartilage frequently found in the tendon of the peroneus longus. The surface of bone behind the groove is rough, for the attachment of the plantar calcaneocuboid ligament, a few fibers of the flexor hallucis brevis, and a fasciculus from the tendon of the tibialis posterior.

The lateral surface presents a deep notch formed by the commencement of the peroneal sulcus.

The posterior surface is smooth, triangular, and concavo-convex, for articulation with the anterior surface of the calcaneus (the calcaneocuboid joint); its infero-medial angle projects backward as a process which underlies and supports the anterior end of the calcaneus.

The anterior surface, of smaller size, but also irregularly triangular, is divided by a vertical ridge into two facets, forming the fourth and fifth tarsometatarsal joints: the medial facet, quadrilateral in form, articulates with the fourth metatarsal; the lateral, larger and more triangular, articulates with the fifth.

The medial surface is broad, irregularly quadrilateral, and presents at its middle and upper part a smooth oval facet, for articulation with the third cuneiform; and behind this (occasionally) a smaller facet, for articulation with the navicular bone; it is rough in the rest of its extent, for the attachment of strong interosseous ligaments.

===Muscle attachments===
Only one muscle is attached to the cuboid bone; the tibialis posterior. The tibialis posterior inserts to the under surface of the cuboid bone. While the flexor hallucis brevis arises, by a pointed tendinous process, from the medial part of the under surface of the cuboid bone, from the contiguous portion of the lateral cuneiform bone, and from the prolongation of the tendon of the tibialis posterior.

==Clinical significance==
In a condition known as cuboid syndrome, the cuboid can be subluxated downward causing a swollen kind of ache along the central portion of the lateral border of the foot.

<doc id="242627" wikidata="Q513689" url="?curid=242627" title="Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport">
<text>Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport (, ) is an international freight and former passenger airport serving Dakar, the capital of Senegal. The airport is situated near the town of Yoff, a northern suburb of Dakar. It was known as Dakar-Yoff International Airport () until 9 October 1996, when it was renamed in honor of Léopold Sédar Senghor, the first president of Senegal.

==History==
During World War II, Dakar Airport was a key link in the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command Natal-Dakar air route, which provided a transoceanic link between Brazil and French West Africa after 1942. Massive amounts of cargo were stored at Dakar, which were then transported along the North African Cairo-Dakar transport route for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel. From Dakar, flights were made to Dakhla Airport, near Villa Cisneros in what was then Spanish Sahara, or to Atar Airport, depending on the load on the air route. In addition to being the western terminus of the North African route, Dakar was the northern terminus for the South African route, which transported personnel to Pretoria, South Africa, with numerous stopovers at Robertsfield (now Roberts International Airport), Liberia, the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia.

Before the introduction of long-range jets in the mid-1970s, it was an important stopover point for the routes between Europe and South America, along with the Canary Islands.

From 21 January 1976 to 31 March 1982, Air France Concordes used the airport as a refueling stop between Paris and Rio de Janeiro on Wednesdays and Sundays.

The airport was a Space Shuttle landing site until 1987, when it was determined that a dip in the runway could damage the shuttle upon landing.

It was one of the five main hubs of the now defunct multi-national airline Air Afrique.

Aeroflot used to serve the airport from the 1970s, it flew the Moscow-Dakar route with stopovers midroute. In the 1990s, Aeroflot replaced the route with a nonstop flight from Moscow to Dakar. However, this service was terminated somewhere around 2000. Marking the end of the airline’s 3 decades-long presence in the airport.

The airport has often been used as a stopover on flights between North America and Southern Africa. Delta Air Lines started service on 4 December 2006 between Atlanta and Johannesburg, with an intermediate stop in Dakar. This stopover has since been removed, with Dakar now served nonstop by Delta from New York–JFK. South African Airways used Dakar as a stopover with both its flights from Johannesburg to Washington and New York. The stopover for the New York–JFK flight was later removed, while the Johannesburg to Washington–Dulles flight now operates via Accra.

Senegal Airlines had a hub operation and their headquarters at the airport before the company&#x27;s demise in April, 2016.

Construction of a replacement airport, Blaise Diagne International, inland from Léopold Sédar Senghor, began in 2007. Saudi Binladin Group constructed the new airport, named after the first black African elected to France&#x27;s parliament in 1914, Blaise Diagne. It was initially expected to take 30 months to build and is designed for an initial capacity of 3 million passengers a year – almost double the 1.7 million annual traffic handled by the existing airport. Blaise Diagne was delayed several times and finally opened on 7 December 2017. As of March 2020 Senghor Airport serves only charter flights and scheduled cargo services, but not regular passenger flights.

==Other facilities==
The head office of &quot;Agence Nationale de l&#x27;Aviation Civile du Sénégal&quot; is also on the airport property.

At one time Air Sénégal International had its head office on the grounds of the airport.

The airport is also home to the French Air Force&#x27;s Dakar-Ouakam Air Base (Base aérienne Dakar-Ouakam; also known as Air Base 160, &quot;Base aérienne 160 Dakar-Ouakam&quot;). The Dakar-Ouakam Air Base formed the military section of the airport.

The airport can handle wide body jets, including in the past the Airbus A340-600 from South African Airways, and the Boeing 777-200 from Air France. In 2015, the airport served about 1,986,000 passengers.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
Since the opening of its successor in 2017, commercial operations were shifted there. However, in January 2024, Air Senegal launched flights to Saint-Louis (XLS) on Mondays and Fridays. There are plans to use Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport (DKR) as a domestic hub airport for Air Senegal with flights to the interior of the country to Kédougou (KGG), Tambacounda (TUD), and Matam (MAX) using newly acquired Czech L-410 type aircraft .

<doc id="242628" wikidata="Q134514" url="?curid=242628" title="Suez">
<text>Suez (, , , ) is a seaport city with a population of about 800,000 in north-eastern Egypt, located on the north coast of the Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea, near the southern terminus of the Suez Canal. It is the capital and largest city of the Suez Governorate. It has three ports: the Suez Port (Port Tewfik), al-Adabiya, and al-Zaytiya, and extensive port facilities. Together, the three cities form the Suez metropolitan area, located mostly in Africa with a small portion in Asia.

Railway lines and highways connect the city with Cairo, Port Said, and Ismailia. Suez has a petrochemical plant, and its oil refineries have pipelines carrying the finished product to Cairo. These are represented in the flag of the governorate: the blue background refers to the sea, the gear refers to Suez&#x27;s status as an industrial governorate, and the flame refers to the petroleum firms of Suez.

The modern city of Suez is a successor of the ancient city of Clysma, a major Red Sea port and a center of monasticism.

== Etymology ==
The city&#x27;s name is derived from a form of the Arabic word for &#x27;liquorice&#x27; ().

==History==
===Achaemenid era===
Darius the Great&#x27;s Suez Inscriptions were texts written in Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian and Egyptian on five monuments erected in Wadi Tumilat, commemorating the opening of a canal between the Nile and the Bitter Lakes, to facilitate a shipping connection between Egypt, then a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, and Persia (i.e. the greater portion of the Empire itself).

====Text of the Suez Inscriptions====
Partial transliteration and translation of the inscription:

Transliteration of the Old Persian text:
English translation:
&quot;King Darius says: I am a Persian; setting out from Persia I conquered Egypt. I ordered to dig this canal from the river that is called Nile and flows in Egypt, to the sea that begins in Persia. Therefore, when this canal had been dug as I had ordered, ships went from Egypt through this canal to Persia, as I had intended.&quot;

===Early Islamic era===
In the 7th century AD a town named &quot;Kolzum&quot; stood just north of the site of present-day Suez and served as eastern terminus of a canal built by Amr ibn al-&#x27;As, linking the Nile River and the Red Sea. Kolzum&#x27;s trade fell following the closure of the canal in 770 by the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur, to prevent his enemies in Arabia from accessing supplies from Egypt and the lands north of it. Nonetheless, the town benefited from the trade that remained between Egypt and Arabia. By 780 al-Mansur&#x27;s successor al-Mahdi restored part of the canal. The Qarmatians led by al-Hasan al-A&#x27;sam defeated a Fatimid army headed by Jawhar al-Siqilli at Kolzum in 971 and thereby captured the town. Following his defeat in Cairo by al-Siqilli at the end of that year, Hasan and his forces retreated to Arabia via Kolzum. Suez was situated nearby and served as a source of drinking water for Kolzum, according to the Arab traveler al-Muqaddasi, who visited in 986.

The Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, Saladin, fortified both Kolzum and Suez in order to defend Egypt&#x27;s eastern frontier from Crusader raids by Raynald of Chatillon. Between 1183 and 1184, Raynald had ships stationed in the Red Sea to prevent the Ayyubid garrison at Kolzum from accessing water. In response, Saladin&#x27;s brother al-Adil had Husam ad-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; build a naval fleet, which sailed to the southern port of Aidab to end Raynald&#x27;s venture. By the 13th century, it was recorded that Kolzum was in ruins, as was Suez, which had gradually replaced the former as a population center. According to Muslim historians al-Maqrizi and al-Idrisi, Kolzum had once been a prosperous town, until it was occupied and plundered by Bedouins. Arab geographer al-Dimashqi noted that Kolzum belonged to the Mamluk province of al-Karak at the time.

===Ottoman and Egyptian rule===

To prevent Portuguese attacks against Egyptian coastal towns and the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Qansuh al-Ghawri, the last Mamluk sultan, ordered a 6,000-man force headed by Selman Reis to defend Suez in 1507, which in turn limited the Mamluk military&#x27;s capabilities against the Ottomans in the Mediterranean Sea. Following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt at the beginning of the 16th century, Suez became both a major naval and trading station. The Ottoman fleets at Suez were instrumental in disputing control over Indian Ocean trade with the Portuguese. in the Red Sea in the 16th &amp; 17th century. Campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. Yellow - Factories ( Mokha) Red - Allied Territorie or under influence. Dark Green - Campaigns of Adal.

==== Portuguese attacks ====

In trying to limit the Ottoman Navy to the Red Sea, after the siege of Diu in 1538, a Portuguese fleet was sent in 1541 to seek out and destroy the Ottoman navy. After capturing El Tor on the Egyptian coast, the fleet&#x27;s commander Estevão da Gama gave the order to attack Suez, but failed to engage the Ottoman fleet as the Ottomans had received intelligence about the incoming attack beforehand. Instead, the Portuguese fleet spent the next 7 months in the Red Sea sailing from port to port and waiting in Massawa before eventually leaving for India.

German explorer Carsten Niebuhr noted that in the 18th century a 20-strong fleet sailed annually from Suez to Jeddah, which served both as Mecca&#x27;s port and Egypt&#x27;s gateway for trade with India. However, by the French invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798, Suez had once again devolved into an unimportant town. Fighting between French and Ottoman troops in 1800 left most of the town in ruins. Its importance as a port increased after the Suez Canal opened in 1869.

===Modern era===
The city was virtually destroyed during battles in the late 1960s and early 1970s between Egyptian and Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula. The town was deserted following the Six-Day War in 1967. Avraham Adan tried to capture the city but it failed, it cost the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) 80 troops killed, 120 wounded and 40 tanks destroyed. Reconstruction of Suez began soon after Egypt reopened the Suez Canal, following the Yom Kippur War with Israel.

Suez was the first city to hold major protests against the government of Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Egyptian revolution and was the scene of the first fatality of that uprising. On account of this, it has been called the Sidi Bouzid of Egypt, recalling that small town&#x27;s role in the 2010–2011 Tunisian revolution.

In 2021, the container ship &quot;Ever Given&quot; became stuck across the Suez canal near Suez. This came to be known as the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction.

==City districts==
The city is divided into five main districts:

===El Arbaeen District===

The most populous district of the city, it has most of the government buildings and public institutions. It also has the city&#x27;s main fruit and vegetable markets in addition to other markets and stores selling various commodities.

===Suez District===

Suez district is considered the most affluent area in the city. The real estate there is significantly more expensive than any other district in the city. Its buildings have more modern architectural style than those in the El Arbaeen District. It includes the affluent neighbourhood of Port Tawfik, which directly overlooks the Suez Canal. Port Tawfik includes some old-style houses that date back to the era of English occupation. The district also includes two of Egypt&#x27;s most important oil refineries; El-Nasr Petroleum Company and Suez Petroleum Company. Also, Suez Port, one of Egypt&#x27;s main ports, lies within the perimeter of Suez District.

===El Ganayen District===
This district stretches all the way to the border with Ismailia Governorate and contains the entire Asian territory of the city. It has all the rural areas of the city and can be thought of as the city&#x27;s &quot;countryside&quot;.

===Faisal District===
It includes the newer neighbourhoods of the city. Most of the areas at Faisal District were established after the 1973 Yom Kippur war, which had destroyed vast areas of the city. Examples of neighborhoods in Faisal District include Al-Sabbah, Al-Amal and Al-Mushi, to name a few.

===Ataqah District===
It is characterised by the existence of many industrial areas. There are plants and factories specialising in fertilisers, cement, steel, cooking oil, flour products, oil rigs, ceramic tiles, sugar, and many other products. There is also the Attaka Power Plant.

The district also includes Ain Sokhna, one of Egypt&#x27;s most important sea resorts, overlooking the Gulf of Suez. Ain Sokhna has numerous high-class sea resorts and is frequented by many tourists, Egyptians and foreigners, all over the year due to its warm weather. The district is also home to the Ain Sokhna Sea Port, one of Egypt&#x27;s main sea ports operated by the Dubai-based DP World Company and the Al-Ataka Fishing Port, which is the city&#x27;s main fish production port.

==Suez Canal==

In ancient times, there was a canal from the Nile delta to the Gulf of Suez, when the gulf extended further north than it does today. This canal fell into disuse, and the present canal was built in the nineteenth century.

The Suez Canal offers a significantly shorter passage for ships, as compared to passing round the Cape of Good Hope. The construction of the Suez Canal was favoured by the natural conditions of the region: the comparatively short distance between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the occurrence of a line of lakes or depressions which became lakes (Lake Manzala in the north, and depressions, Timsah and the Bitter Lakes, part way along the route), and the generally flat terrain. The construction of the canal was proposed by the engineer and French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, who in 1854 acquired from Said Pasha the rights of constructing and operating the canal for a period of 99 years. The &quot;Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez&quot; was formed. Construction took 11 years, and the canal opened on 17 November 1869. The canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade.

In July 1956, just a few days after the fourth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Egyptian government under President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal Company, which had been run by the French and owned privately, with the British as the largest shareholders. In 1956, Israeli, British and French forces invaded the Suez Canal, which became known as the Suez Crisis. Following Israel&#x27;s invasion and occupation of the Sinai Peninsula in the Six-Day War of 1967, the Canal was closed, and did not reopen until 1975.

On March 23, 2021, a container ship called the Ever Given ran aground in the canal and blocked it.

Today, the Canal is a vital link in world trade, and contributes significantly to the Egyptian economy; in 2009 the income generated from the canal accounted for 3.7% of Egypt&#x27;s GDP.

<doc id="242633" wikidata="Q1277650" url="?curid=242633" title="Míl Espáine">
<text>In Irish origin myths, Míl Espáine or Míl Espáne (later Latinized as Milesius) is the mythical ancestor of the final inhabitants of Ireland, the &quot;sons of Míl&quot; or Milesians, who represent the vast majority of the Irish Gaels. His father was Bile, son of Breogan. Modern historians believe he is a creation of medieval Irish Christian writers.

==Name and origin==
Mark Williams characterises the name &quot;Míl Espáine&quot; as an &quot;etymological figment&quot; translated from the Latin &quot;mīles Hispaniae&quot;, meaning &quot;soldier of Hispania (Spain)&quot;, attested in a passage (§ 13) in the 9th-century work &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (&quot;The History of the Britons&quot;) by Nennius.

As A.G. van Hamel has suggested, the status of Iberia as the land of origin can be traced back to Isidore of Seville, who in the introduction to his history of the Goths, Vandals and Suebi had elevated Iberia/Hispania to the &quot;mother of all races&quot;. Another likely reason the Irish were said to come from Iberia was the mistaken belief that &quot;Hibernia&quot;, the Latin name of Ireland, came from &quot;Iberia&quot;/&quot;Hiberia&quot;. A further explanation may lie in the mistake made by some classical geographers in locating Ireland closely opposite Iberia. For instance, the &quot;Lebar Gabála&quot; (§ 100) recounts that from Bregon&#x27;s Tower, the Milesian Íth was able to see right across the sea to Ireland. In Galician history, that tower is the Torre de Hercules in A Coruña, Galicia.

==Legend==
===&quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;===
The earliest surviving mention of the character is from the 9th century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (History of the Britons). It says that Ireland was settled by three groups of people from the Iberian Peninsula. The first group are the people of Partholón, who all die of plague. The second group are the people of Nemed, who eventually return to Iberia. The third group are led by three sons of a warrior of Spain (&quot;tres filii militis Hispaniae&quot;), who sail to Ireland with thirty ships, each carrying thirty wives. They see a glass tower in the middle of the sea with men on top of it, but the men do not answer their calls. The Milesians set out to take the tower, but when they reach it, all but one of their ships are sunk by a great wave. Only one ship is saved, and its passengers are the ancestors of all the Irish. In the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, it is the people of Nemed who are drowned while trying to capture a tower by the sea.

===&quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;===
The earliest version of the Irish &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (Book of the Taking of Ireland) was compiled in the 11th century. It says that Ireland was settled by six groups of people: the people of Cessair, the people of Partholón, the people of Nemed, the Fir Bolg, the supernatural Tuatha Dé Danann, and lastly the sons of Míl Espáine, an Irish borrowing of the Latin &quot;mīles Hispaniae&quot;. 
The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; traces the Irish back to the Scythians and further back to Japheth, one of the sons of Noah. It says that Míl was born in Iberia and was the son of Bilé, son of Breogán. Some versions say Míl&#x27;s birth name was Golam.

According to some versions, Míl returns to Scythia, the land of his forebears, where he becomes an army commander. He then spends some time in Egypt, where he marries Scota, a daughter of the pharaoh. Míl eventually returns to Iberia, where he wins several great battles before dying there.

One of Míl&#x27;s relatives, Íth, visits Ireland but is killed there by the Tuatha Dé Danann. Míl&#x27;s eight sons—Éber Finn, Éber Donn, Érimón, Ír, Érannan, Amergin, Colptha and Airech—sail to Ireland and take possession of it from the Tuatha Dé Danann.

==Offspring==
Among the sons of Míl in Ireland were Éber Finn, Érimón, Ír and Amergin. The traditional genealogies of Gaelic Ireland and Gaelic Scotland trace the ancestors of the Gaels back to one of the first three sons. Typically, the descendants of Éber Finn were prominent in Munster (including the Eóganachta, Uí Fidgenti and Uí Liatháin), the progeny of Ír, through his son Éber formed the bulk of Ulster (including the Ulaidh; Dál nAraidi, Conmhaícne, Ciarraige and Corco Mruad) and then offspring of Érimón were most powerful in Connacht, Leinster and parts of Ulster (including the Connachta, Uí Néill, Clan Colla, Uí Maine, Laighin, Dalcassians and the Érainn).

According to John O&#x27;Hart in &quot;Irish Pedigrees&quot; (1876), in his younger days, Milesius, while travelling through Africa, is said to have killed three lions and subsequently bore three lions as his symbol. Each of the lions were borne by his progeny: Heber Fionn and Heremon (as well as their descendants) bore the gold and red lions respectively, while his grandson Heber mac Ír bore the blue lion.

<text>John Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Baxter (September 27, 1958 January 25, 2002) was an Enron Corporation executive who resigned in May 2001 before committing suicide the following year. Prior to his death he had agreed to testify before Congress in the Enron scandal.

==Early life==

Baxter was born in Amityville, New York, and graduated from New York University. After graduating, he served in the U.S. Air Force from 1980 to 1985 and rose to the rank of captain. After he was discharged from the military, he enrolled at Columbia University where he received an MBA degree two years later. He worked in investment banking briefly before he joined Enron in 1991 where he rose to the executive position of chief strategy officer before his resignation.

==Scandal at Enron==
On August 15, 2001, Sherron Watkins, Vice President of Corporate Development at Enron, wrote an anonymous letter to Kenneth Lay sharing her concerns about the company&#x27;s accounting practices, and cited Baxter&#x27;s prior complaints to Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and other Enron executives regarding what he considered Enron&#x27;s unethical and possible illegal transactions. This was a day after the abrupt resignation of Skilling as CEO of Enron, who was later characterized by writers Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind in &quot;The Smartest Guys in the Room&quot; as being Baxter&#x27;s closest friend at Enron.

Baxter would later be sued personally for $30 million after the bankruptcy of Enron due to his sale of $30 million worth of Enron stock in the months prior to Enron&#x27;s bankruptcy in December 2001.

&quot;Fortune&quot; magazine writer Bethany McLean described Baxter in &quot;Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room&quot; as being a good deal-maker but also being a manic depressive.

Skilling stated before Congress in February 2002 that Baxter had visited Skilling shortly after Enron had declared bankruptcy and was &quot;heartbroken&quot; by what had happened at Enron. In his testimony, Skilling quoted Baxter as saying: &quot;They&#x27;re calling us child molesters. That will never wash off.&quot;

== Suicide ==
On January 25, 2002, after agreeing to testify before Congressional committees in February 2002 after being subpoenaed regarding his knowledge and evidence of the scandal at Enron, Baxter was found dead in his black Mercedes-Benz S500 in Sugar Land, Texas, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The ammunition used was a Glaser Safety Slug, which at the time was misreported as snake shot. A revolver was found in his car and a suicide note was found in his wife&#x27;s car at their home. An autopsy was performed by the Harris County Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office and the death was ruled a suicide. Baxter&#x27;s suicide was partly dramatized during the opening credits of &quot;&quot;.

His suicide note was hand printed, though not signed, for his wife, Carol. The letter expressed Baxter&#x27;s despair over the direction his life had taken.

The full text of the note read:

&lt;poem&gt;Carol, 
I am so sorry for this. I feel I just can&#x27;t go on. I have always tried to do the right thing but where there was once great pride now it&#x27;s gone. I love you and the children so much. I just can&#x27;t be any good to you or myself. The pain is overwhelming.
Please try to forgive me.
Cliff&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004 was the second edition of the annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest for young singers aged eight to fifteen. It was held on 20 November 2004, in Håkons Hall, Lillehammer, Norway and lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes. It was presented by Stian Barsnes Simonsen and Nadia Hasnaoui, broadcast in twenty countries and viewed by 100 million people. Eighteen countries participated, and participated for the first time.

The contest was won by 9-year-old María Isabel who represented with her song &quot;Antes muerta que sencilla&quot; (Better Dead Than Plain) from her debut album &quot;¡No me toques las palmas que me conozco!&quot; which was released before the contest. Dino Jelusić, who won the 2003 contest for , presented the award to María. Since then, Isabel has entered the charts in not only Spain but France, Italy, Scandinavia, Latin America and has gone on to release further albums in her home country.

, who came ninth received more sets of twelve points than the , who came second. , who came sixth, were voted by all the other countries that took part, which is more than the number of countries that voted for , who came fourth and , who came third.

Incidentally, the same three countries occupied the top three places as last year, just in a different order. These three countries were Spain, the United Kingdom, and Croatia.

== Origins and history ==

The origins of the contest date back to 2000 when Danmarks Radio held a song contest for Danish children that year and the following year. The idea was extended to a Scandinavian song competition in 2002, known as MGP Nordic, with Denmark, Norway and Sweden as participants. In November 2002, the EBU picked up the idea for a song contest featuring children and opened the competition to all EBU member broadcasters making it a pan-European event. The working title of the programme was &quot;Eurovision Song Contest for Children&quot;, branded with the name of the EBU&#x27;s already long-running and popular song competition, the Eurovision Song Contest. Denmark was asked to host the first programme that took place the following year after their experience with their own contests and the MGP Nordic.

==Location==

===Host city selection===
Norway was the third country of choice for this contest as the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) had, in May 2003, originally chosen broadcaster ITV of the United Kingdom to host the event. Shortly after the first contest in Copenhagen, it was confirmed that the next edition would be held in Manchester on 20 November 2004. However, ITV pulled out in May 2004 due to finance and scheduling problems. In August 2004, it was revealed that Granada Television, who would have co-produced the show with Carlton Television, had decided to pull out of the deal claiming the allocated budget of €1,500,000 was too small. The EBU offered funding of €900,000 to produce the event, but the ITV company said it would have cost almost €2,500,000 so asked them to find a new host broadcaster. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years&#x27; audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount.

The venue was therefore moved to Croatia, the winning country of 2003, but the Croatian broadcaster HRT reportedly forgot that the prospective venue for the event was already booked for the period the Junior Eurovision Song Contest was to take place. It was at this point that in June 2004, with five months remaining until the event would be held, that Norwegian broadcaster NRK offered to organise the next contest. Hosting duties were confirmed by the broadcaster itself a few days later, adding that the competition would take place at Håkons Hall in Lillehammer on the same date as originally planned.

===Venue===

Håkons Hall, sometimes anglicized as Håkon Hall and Haakons Hall, is an arena located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, Norway, built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. With a spectator capacity of 11,500 people, it is the largest handball and ice hockey venue in the country.

Håkons Hall is regularly used for handball and ice hockey tournaments, concerts, exhibitions, conferences and banquets. The venue is owned by Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiapark, which owns all the Olympic venues in Lillehammer. The Norwegian Olympic Museum is located in the arena, which is located next to the smaller Kristins Hall. The hall was opened on 1 February 1993 having cost 238 million Norwegian krone (NOK).

== Participating countries ==

The EBU released the initial list of participants with 20 competing countries. France and Switzerland made their debut in the contest. Although initially confirmed as a participating countries, both and ended up pulling out before the contest. There were also early reports that had planned to enter in the contest, but did not appear on the final list of participants.

Prior to the event, a compilation album featuring all the songs from the 2004 contest, along with karaoke versions, was put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by Universal Music Group in November 2004.

==Format==
===Visual design===
On 2 September 2004, host broadcaster NRK presented the official logo of the contest. The theme of the show was later confirmed as bright Nordic winter nights, sparkling stars and snow crystals, set in a hip-hop atmosphere.

===Presenters===
On 23 September 2004, it was announced that Nadia Hasnaoui and Stian Barsnes Simonsen would host the contest. The hosting couple also led the final of national qualifying rounds to the competition, Melodi Grand Prix Junior 2004 on 12 June.

===Voting===
All countries used televoting to decide on their top ten. In normal Eurovision fashion, each country&#x27;s favourite song was given 12 points, their second favourite 10, and their third to tenth favourites were given 8–1 points.

==Contest overview==
The event took place on 20 November 2004 at 20:15 CET. Eighteen countries participated, with the running order published on 14 October 2004. All the countries competing were eligible to vote by televote. Spain won with 171 points, with the United Kingdom, Croatia, Romania, Denmark, completing the top five. Belarus, Sweden, Switzerland, Latvia, and Poland, both of whom came last, occupied the bottom five positions.

The show was opened by the flag parade showing all participating countries. The interval act included Irish boy band Westlife performed &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head?&quot; live on stage.

<doc id="242643" wikidata="Q421801" url="?curid=242643" title="Calcium carbide">
<text>Calcium carbide, also known as calcium acetylide, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of . Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.

The pure material is colorless, while pieces of technical-grade calcium carbide are grey or brown and consist of about 80–85% of (the rest is CaO (calcium oxide), (calcium phosphide), CaS (calcium sulfide), (calcium nitride), SiC (silicon carbide), C (carbon), etc.). In the presence of trace moisture, technical-grade calcium carbide emits an unpleasant odor reminiscent of garlic.

Applications of calcium carbide include manufacture of acetylene gas, generation of acetylene in carbide lamps, manufacture of chemicals for fertilizer, and steelmaking.

==Production==
Calcium carbide is produced industrially in an electric arc furnace from a mixture of lime and coke at approximately . This is an endothermic reaction requiring per mole and high temperatures to drive off the carbon monoxide. This method has not changed since its invention in 1892:

The high temperature required for this reaction is not practically achievable by traditional combustion, so the reaction is performed in an electric arc furnace with graphite electrodes. The carbide product produced generally contains around 80% calcium carbide by weight. The carbide is crushed to produce small lumps that can range from a few mm up to 50 mm. The impurities are concentrated in the finer fractions. The content of the product is assayed by measuring the amount of acetylene produced on hydrolysis. As an example, the British and German standards for the content of the coarser fractions are 295 L/kg and 300 L/kg respectively (at 101 kPa pressure and temperature). Impurities present in the carbide include calcium phosphide, which produces phosphine when hydrolysed.

This reaction was an important part of the Industrial Revolution in chemistry, and was made possible in the United States as a result of massive amounts of inexpensive hydroelectric power produced at Niagara Falls before the turn of the 20th century.
The electric arc furnace method was discovered in 1892 by T. L. Willson, and independently in the same year by H. Moissan. In Jajce, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Austrian industrialist Josef Kranz and his &quot;Bosnische-Elektrizitäts AG&quot; company, whose successor later became &quot;Elektro-Bosna&quot;, opened the largest chemical factory for the production of calcium carbide at the time in Europe in 1899. A hydroelectric power station on the Pliva river with an installed capacity of 8 MW was constructed to supply electricity for the factory, the first power station of its kind in Southeast Europe, and became operational on 24 March 1899.

==Crystal structure==
Calcium carbide is a calcium salt of acetylene, consisting of calcium cations and acetylide anions . Pure calcium carbide is a colourless solid. The common crystalline form at room temperature is a distorted rock-salt structure with the units lying parallel. There are three different polymorphs which appear at room temperature: the tetragonal structure and two different monoclinic structures.

==Applications==

===Production of acetylene===
The reaction of calcium carbide with water, producing acetylene and calcium hydroxide, was discovered by Friedrich Wöhler in 1862.

This reaction was the basis of the industrial manufacture of acetylene, and is the major industrial use of calcium carbide.

Today acetylene is mainly manufactured by the partial combustion of methane or appears as a side product in the ethylene stream from cracking of hydrocarbons. Approximately 400,000 tonnes are produced this way annually (see acetylene preparation).

In China, acetylene derived from calcium carbide remains a raw material for the chemical industry, in particular for the production of polyvinyl chloride. Locally produced acetylene is more economical than using imported oil. Production of calcium carbide in China has been increasing. In 2005 output was 8.94 million tons, with the capacity to produce 17 million tons.

In the United States, Europe, and Japan, consumption of calcium carbide is generally declining. Production levels in the US during the 1990s were 236,000 tons per year.

===Production of calcium cyanamide===
Calcium carbide reacts with nitrogen at high temperature to form calcium cyanamide:
Commonly known as nitrolime, calcium cyanamide is used as fertilizer. It is hydrolysed to cyanamide, .

===Steelmaking===
Calcium carbide is used:
* in the desulfurization of iron (pig iron, cast iron and steel)
* as a fuel in steelmaking to extend the scrap ratio to liquid iron, depending on economics.
* as a powerful deoxidizer at ladle treatment facilities.

===Carbide lamps===

Calcium carbide is used in carbide lamps. Water dripping on carbide produces acetylene gas, which burns and produces light. While these lamps gave steadier and brighter light than candles, they were dangerous in coal mines, where flammable methane gas made them a serious hazard. The presence of flammable gases in coal mines led to miner safety lamps such as the Davy lamp, in which a wire gauze reduces the risk of methane ignition. Carbide lamps were still used extensively in slate, copper, and tin mines where methane is not a serious hazard. Most miners&#x27; lamps have now been replaced by electric lamps.

Carbide lamps are still used for mining in some less wealthy countries, for example in the silver mines near Potosí, Bolivia. Carbide lamps are also still used by some cavers exploring caves and other underground areas, although they are increasingly being replaced in this use by LED lights.

Carbide lamps were also used extensively as headlamps in early automobiles, motorcycles and bicycles, but have been replaced entirely by electric lamps.

===Other uses===
Calcium carbide is sometimes used as source of acetylene, which like ethylene gas, is a ripening agent. However, this is illegal in some countries as, in the production of acetylene from calcium carbide, contamination often leads to trace production of phosphine and arsine. These impurities can be removed by passing the acetylene gas through acidified copper sulfate solution, but, in developing countries, this precaution is often neglected.

Calcium carbide is used in toy cannons such as the Big-Bang Cannon, as well as in bamboo cannons. In the Netherlands calcium carbide is used around new-year to shoot with milk churns.

Calcium carbide, together with calcium phosphide, is used in floating, self-igniting naval signal flares, such as those produced by the Holmes&#x27; Marine Life Protection Association.

Calcium carbide is used to determine the moisture content of soil. When soil and calcium carbide are mixed in a closed pressure cylinder, the water content in soil reacts with calcium carbide to release acetylene whose pressure can be measured to determine the moisture content.

Calcium carbide is sold commercially as a mole repellent. When it comes into contact with water, the gas produced drives moles away.

<doc id="242648" wikidata="Q949610" url="?curid=242648" title="Shimano">
<text>, originally and later , is a Japanese multinational manufacturing company for cycling components, fishing tackle and rowing equipment, which also produced golf supplies until 2005 and snowboarding gear until 2008. Named after founder Shozaburo Shimano (, 1894–1958) and headquartered in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, the company has 32 consolidated and 11 unconsolidated subsidiaries, with the primary manufacturing plants based in Kunshan (China), Malaysia and Singapore.

In 2017, Shimano had net sales of US $3.2 billion, 38% in Europe, 35% in Asia, and 11% in North America. Bicycle components represented 80%, fishing tackle 19%, and other products 0.1%. The company is publicly traded, with 93 million shares of common stock outstanding.

They are also the official neutral support for most of the UCI World Tour.

== Cycling ==
Shimano sales constitute an estimated 70–80% of the global bicycle component market by value. Its products include drivetrain, brake, wheel, and pedal components for road, mountain, track, and hybrid bikes. The components include cranksets comprising cranks and chainrings, bottom brackets, chains, rear chain sprockets and cassettes, front and rear wheel hubs, gear shift levers, brakes, brake levers, cables, and front and rear dérailleurs. Shimano Total Integration (STI) is Shimano&#x27;s integrated shifter and brake lever combination for road bicycles. The Italian firm Campagnolo as well as US-based SRAM are Shimano&#x27;s primary competitors in the cycling marketplace.

When the 1970s United States bike boom exceeded the capacity of the European bicycle component manufacturers, Japanese manufacturers SunTour and Shimano rapidly stepped in to fill the void. While both companies provided products for all price ranges of the market, SunTour also focused on refinement of existing systems and designs for higher-end products, while Shimano initially paid more attention to rethinking the basic systems and bringing out innovations such as Positron shifting (a precursor to index shifting) and front freewheel systems at the low end of the market. In the 1980s, with Shimano pushing technical innovation and lower prices, the more traditional European component manufacturers lost significant market presence. During this period, in contrast to the near-universal marketing technique of introducing innovations on the expensive side of the marketplace and relying on consumer demand to emulate early adopters along with economy of scale to bring them into the mass market, Shimano and SunTour (to a lesser extent) introduced new technologies at the lowest end of the bicycle market, using lower cost and often heavier and less durable materials and techniques, only moving them further upmarket if they established themselves in the lower market segments.

In the 1980–1983 period, Shimano introduced three groupsets with &quot;AX&quot; technology: Dura-Ace and 600 (high-end), and Adamas in the low-end. Features of these components include aerodynamic styling, center-pull brakes, brake levers with concealed cables, and ergonomic pedals. By 1985 Shimano introduced innovation only at the highest quality level (Dura-Ace for road bikes and XT for mountain bikes), then trickled the technology down to lower production levels as it became proven and accepted. Innovations include index shifting (known as SIS, Shimano Index System introduced in 1984), freehubs, dual-pivot brakes, 8-9-10-speed drivetrains, and the integration of shifters and brake levers. Also, these components could only work properly when used with other Shimano components; for example, its rear derailleurs have to be used with the correct Shimano gear levers, cables, freehub, and cassette. SunTour tried to catch up, but by the end of the 1980s they had lost the technological and commercial battle, and Shimano had become the largest manufacturer of bicycle components in the world.
Shimano&#x27;s marketplace domination that developed in the 1990s quickly led to the perception by some critics that Shimano had become a marketplace bully with monopolistic intentions. This viewpoint was based on the fact that Shimano became oriented towards integrating all of their components with each other, with the result being that if any Shimano components were to be used, then the entire bike would need to be built from matching Shimano components. The alternative perspective is that by controlling the mix of components on the bicycle, a manufacturer such as Shimano can control how well their own product functions. Shimano&#x27;s primary competitors (Campagnolo and SRAM) also make proprietary designs that limit the opportunity to mix and match componentry.

In 2003 Shimano introduced &quot;Dual Control&quot; to mountain bikes, where the gear shift mechanism is integrated into the brake levers. This development was controversial, as the use of Dual Control integrated shifting for hydraulic disc brakes required using Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, locking competitors out of the premium end of the market. However, with their 2007 product line, Shimano moved back to making separate braking and shifting components fully available in addition to the integrated &quot;Dual Control&quot; components, a move to satisfy riders that wished to use Shimano shifting with other brands of disc brakes.

Shimano in 1990 introduced the Shimano Pedaling Dynamics (SPD) range of clipless pedals and matching shoes, designed so that the shoes could be used for walking. The shoes have a recess in the bottom of the sole for fitting the smaller cleats and therefore it does not protrude, while conventional clipless road pedals are designed for road cycling shoes that have smooth soles with large protruding cleats, which are awkward for walking. The SPD range, in addition to other off-road refinements, was designed to be used with treaded soles that more closely resemble rugged hiking boots. SPD pedals and shoes soon established themselves as the market standard in this sector, although many other manufacturers have developed alternatives that may be less prone to being clogged by mud or easier to adjust. However, the SPD dominance in this sector has meant that alternative pedal manufacturers nearly always design their pedals to be usable with Shimano shoes, and likewise mountain bike shoe manufacturers make their shoes &quot;Shimano SPD&quot; compatible. SPD has spawned two types of road cleats that are incompatible with standard SPD pedals and some shoes – SPD-R and SPD-SL. SPD-R is a now-defunct pedal standard. SPD-SL is basically a copy of the standard Look clipless pedal system. It has a wide, one-sided platform and a triangular cleat that is Look three-bolt compatible.

===Results===
Alexi Grewal used a bicycle equipped with Shimano DynaDrive chainset and pedals (the remainder of the components on his bicycle were primarily Suntour and DiaCompe) to win the 1984 Olympic road race in Los Angeles. In the 1988 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Andrew Hampsten rode Shimano to its first Grand Tour victory. In 2002, world championships in both the road and time trial disciplines were won on Shimano equipment. Alberto Contador&#x27;s 2007 victory in the Tour de France on a Shimano-equipped bicycle represents the first official General Classification victory in that race by a rider using Shimano components (Lance Armstrong originally won the TDF with Shimano in 1999 but was later disqualified due to drug use).

===VIA===
&quot;VIA&quot; (&quot;Vehicle Inspection Association&quot;) is stamped on all Shimano parts. It is an official approval stamp used to certify parts of Japanese vehicles – including bicycles. This mark signifies compliance with certain quality standards.

<text>Split Enz were a New Zealand band formed in 1972. Regarded as the first New Zealand band to gain significant recognition outside of Australasia, they were initially noted for their progressive/art rock sound, flamboyant visual style and theatrical performances. The band later moved toward a pop/new wave sound that yielded the breakthrough hit single &quot;I Got You&quot; (1980). Split Enz broke up in 1984. Since that time, the band has staged several brief reunions.

==History==
===Tim Finn/Phil Judd era (1972–1977)===
Originally named Split Ends, presumably referencing split ends of hairs, the band were formed by songwriters Tim Finn (vocals) and Phil Judd (guitar/vocals). The original line-up was completed by Mike Chunn (bass), Miles Golding (violin) and Mike Howard (flute), with the band making their first live appearance on 10 December 1972, at the Wynyard Tavern in Auckland, New Zealand. At the beginning of 1973, they were joined by drummer Div Vercoe, though within a few months, Vercoe, Golding and Howard had all departed, with Finn, Judd and Chunn recruiting Wally Wilkinson on guitar and Chunn&#x27;s brother Geoff on drums. Keyboardist Eddie Rayner and saxophonist Rob Gillies were also added in early 1974, around which time the band altered their name to Split Enz, with the &quot;nz&quot; in the name referring to New Zealand.

During 1973 and 1974, the group recorded three singles, &quot;For You&quot;, &quot;The Sweet Talking Spoon Song&quot; and &quot;No Bother to Me&quot; (the latter not being released until 1975). Those singles, and their B-sides, along with several demos from this period, would later be released as &quot;The Beginning of the Enz&quot; album in 1979. Later in 1974, Rob Gillies and Geoff Chunn left the band, with the latter being replaced by Emlyn Crowther, while Noel Crombie also joined as percussionist and the band&#x27;s visual director. In the early years of Split Enz, they were known as an &quot;adventurous, flamboyant art-rock band&quot; with unique, theatrical live shows. In 1975, the band moved to Australia and recorded their first album &quot;Mental Notes&quot;, which reached No. 7 in New Zealand and No. 35 in Australia. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Wilkinson departed and Rob Gillies re-joined.

In 1976, the band moved to England, where they recorded their second album &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;, produced by Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera. While in the UK, the band toured as support to English folk-rockers Jack the Lad. Crowther left the band in late 1976 and was replaced by Malcolm Green.

===Tim Finn/Neil Finn era (1977–1984)===
Phil Judd and Mike Chunn left the band in 1977. Tim Finn&#x27;s brother, Neil Finn, joined as Judd&#x27;s replacement on 7 April 1977, while Nigel Griggs replaced Chunn on bass. Over time, as well as being the band&#x27;s guitarist, Neil Finn became their co-lead singer and a key songwriter, both alongside his brother Tim. Split Enz&#x27; third album, &quot;Dizrythmia&quot;, was recorded at London&#x27;s AIR Studios with producer, and former Beatles engineer, Geoff Emerick, from June to July 1977. The album was released in August 1977. At the beginning of 1978, Gillies left the band. An attempted reunion with Phil Judd lasted around a month before he departed for the second and final time, after which the remaining members continued as a six-piece.

By mid 1978, Split Enz had no agent, no manager, and no record contract. The New Zealand Arts Council gave the band a grant of $5,000. The grant money was used to book studio time, and the band used that time to record what became known as the &quot;Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Luton Tapes&quot;. One of the songs the band recorded was called &quot;I See Red&quot;. Released as a single later that year, &quot;I See Red&quot; marked a significant move away from the band&#x27;s early progressive/art rock style, towards high-energy, guitar-based power pop. While &quot;I See Red&quot; did not chart in England, it did bring the band critical attention. The single peaked at No. 15 in New Zealand.

The group went home to New Zealand for Christmas 1978. Just after Christmas, there was a serious setback when their equipment was destroyed in a suspicious fire at a rehearsal studio. Using borrowed equipment, Split Enz played what proved to be a pivotal concert, stunning friends and fans alike with a legendary performance at the second Nambassa Festival in January 1979. The band released their fourth album &quot;Frenzy&quot; in 1979.

&quot;True Colours&quot;, released in 1980, further marked the band&#x27;s shift to a &quot;power pop&quot; style. The hit single &quot;I Got You&quot; reached No. 1 in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, No. 12 in the United Kingdom, and No. 53 in the United States. &quot;True Colours&quot; reached No. 1 on the album charts in Australia and New Zealand and made the Top 40 in both the UK and the US.

Split Enz&#x27;s next album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Waiata&quot;, released as &quot;Corroboree&quot; in Australia, reached No. 1 in Australia and New Zealand. After the album&#x27;s completion, Malcolm Green departed, and the band continued as a five-piece, with Noel Crombie moving from percussionist to drummer. The next album, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, reached No. 1 in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. One of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Six Months in a Leaky Boat&quot;, was listed as the fifth-best New Zealand song of all time in the 2001 Australasian Performing Right Association, but the song became controversial in England because it was perceived as a criticism of the Falklands War.

After releasing &quot;Conflicting Emotions&quot; in 1983, the band became a six-piece again with the addition of drummer Paul Hester, while Crombie returned to his previous role of percussionist. In the spring of 1984, Tim Finn left the band for a solo career, following the success of his first solo album &quot;Escapade&quot; the previous year. Neil Finn assumed the role of band leader and main songwriter, but felt uncomfortable continuing the band without either of its founders Tim Finn or Phil Judd. It was decided their next album &quot;See Ya &#x27;Round&quot; would be their last. Following the album&#x27;s release, Tim Finn re-joined for a final farewell tour. Split Enz played their final show on 6 December 1984 at Logan Campbell Centre in Auckland, after which they officially split.

Neil Finn and Paul Hester went on to form a new band called the Mullanes with bassist Nick Seymour. They had changed their name to Crowded House by the time their self-titled first album was released in 1986, going on to achieve worldwide success. Tim Finn also joined Crowded House as a fourth member from 1989 to 1991, during which time the band recorded and released their third album &quot;Woodface&quot;.

===Reunions===
In 1986, two years after Split Enz broke up, they reunited for a Greenpeace benefit concert. That was followed by a pair of concerts in Australia in 1989/1990. The first of those performances was scheduled for 28 December 1989 at the Newcastle Worker&#x27;s Club. However, the club was virtually destroyed that morning by an earthquake. The band instead appeared at a benefit concert in February 1990 which raised funds to support the town&#x27;s recovery.

The band reunited in 1993 for their twentieth anniversary tour, during which they played at Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland, supported by The Holy Toledos. They appeared on TV in 2002 to celebrate their thirtieth anniversary. In 2006, Split Enz toured with a membership consisting of the classic 1978–1981 line-up of Tim Finn, Neil Finn, Nigel Griggs, Eddie Rayner, Noel Crombie, and Malcolm Green.

Another reunion tour followed in March 2008, with four shows in New Zealand. A one-off reunion performance took place on 14 March 2009, as part of the Sound Relief festival.

===Legacy===
In total, Split Enz had ten albums (including seven studio albums) reach the top 10 of the Official New Zealand Music Chart. They have had eight songs listed in the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time, more than any other band.

<text>An administrator (administrator of the government or officer administering the government) in the constitutional practice of some countries in the Commonwealth is a person who fulfils a role similar to that of a governor or a governor-general.

==Temporary administrators==
Usually the office of administrator is a temporary appointment, for periods during which the governor is incapacitated, outside the territory, or otherwise unable to perform his or her duties. The process for selecting administrators varies from country to country.

===Australia===

In the Commonwealth of Australia, the administrator is usually called the &quot;administrator of the Commonwealth&quot;. State governors hold a dormant commission and by convention the longest-serving state governor becomes administrator.

In the states of Australia, the administrator is usually the lieutenant-governor of the state who is, often, also the chief justice of the state&#x27;s supreme court or the next most senior justice. In 2001, the Constitution of Queensland was amended to restore the office of lieutenant-governor in that state.

===Canada===

An &quot;administrator of the government&quot; in Canada is a constitutional practice where an individual is empowered to perform the functions of the office of the governor general if the governor general is incapable of rendering their constitutional duties, or if the position of Governor General is vacant following a resignation or death. The provisions to select the administrator of the government in Canada is outlined in Article VIII of the &quot;Letters Patent, 1947&quot;; which identifies that the Chief Justice of Canada assumes the role as administrator should the need arise. In the absence of the chief justice, the senior Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada is designated as the administrator of the government. Prior to the &quot;Letters Patent, 1947&quot;, the administrator of the government was directly appointed by the monarch. An administrator of the government is not required if a governor general is absent for less than 30 days, with the governor general empowered to designate a &quot;deputy governor general&quot; to act on their behalf. Richard Wagner is the most recent in Canada designated as the &quot;administrator of the government,&quot; having been sworn in to the position on 23 January 2021 after Governor General Payette resigned. He served as administrator until the Queen appointed Mary Simon as governor general on 26 July 2021, on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

The constitutional practice of an &quot;administrator of the government&quot; is also found within the provinces of Canada, with provincial administrators of the government assuming the functions of the office of the lieutenant governor if its holder is incapable of rendering their duties. The federal government typically appoints the chief justice of each province as the provincial administrator of government. Unlike the federal administrator, provincial administrators cannot act if the office of lieutenant governor is vacant.

The term &quot;administrator&quot; is also used in the Canadian territory of Yukon, although the position of administrator in Yukon is analogous to a &quot;deputy commissioner of Yukon&quot;.

===Ceylon===
In Ceylon, the officer administering the government in the absence of the governor-general of Ceylon was the chief justice of Ceylon. In the absence of the chief justice the acting chief justice would serve in this place. Ceylon had two acting governors-general.

===Hong Kong===
When Hong Kong was a British Crown colony the chief secretary (colonial secretary before 1976) would be the &quot;acting governor&quot;, followed by the financial secretary and the attorney general. The practice has remained after the transfer of sovereignty to China. Rotation takes place between the chief secretary for administration (formerly chief secretary), the financial secretary and the secretary for justice (formerly attorney general) as the acting chief executive.

===New Zealand===
Under the Governor-General Act 2010, there are certain times where the chief justice, currently Helen Winkelmann, will fulfil the role of administrator of the government (acting governor-general). These times may be when the governor-general is outside New Zealand, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to carry out their duties, or more prominently when the position is vacant . If the chief justice is unable to become administrator of the government for similar reasons as above then the title follows the order of seniority in the judicial system.

===Papua New Guinea===
As a former external territory of Australia, the head of the territory&#x27;s administration was called the administrator of Papua-New Guinea before independence in 1975. The appointment was by the governor-general of Australia on the advice of the Australian minister of external territories. The minister for external territories consulted with the territory&#x27;s chief minister as part of the appointment process.

===Rhodesia===

On 11 November 1965, the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia made a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) although it continued to recognise the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, as head of state, with oaths of allegiance to &quot;Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth, Queen of Rhodesia, her heirs and successors&quot;. However, the Rhodesian Front government of Ian Smith ceased to recognise the authority of her &quot;de jure&quot; representative, Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs.

Instead, on 17 November, it appointed the former deputy prime minister, Clifford Dupont, to the post of &quot;acting officer administering the government&quot;. Opponents of UDI who considered it an illegal move, such as the independent member of the legislative assembly, Ahrn Palley, refused to recognise Dupont&#x27;s office, and walked out of the opening of the Parliament of Rhodesia when Dupont came to deliver the Speech from the Throne.

On 2 December, Smith wrote a personal letter to the Queen, asking her to accept Dupont as the new governor-general. In response, he was told that &quot;Her Majesty is not able to entertain purported advice of this kind, and has therefore been pleased to direct that no action shall be taken upon it&quot;.

Under the 1965 draft constitution, if the Queen did not appoint a governor-general within fourteen days of advice being tendered by the prime minister, a regent was to be appointed. In deference to the royal family, however, on 16 December, Smith amended his original plan to appoint a regent and Dupont was appointed as &quot;officer administering the government&quot;.

Consequently, legislation passed after UDI was &quot;enacted by His Excellency the Officer Administering the Government, as the representative of the Queen&#x27;s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Rhodesia&quot;. Dupont would continue to use the title until 1970. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution that year, he became the first President of Rhodesia, a position that was internationally unrecognised, given the fact that Rhodesia was de jure a British colony.

The country was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, before it returned to colonial status following the Lancaster House Agreement later that year. In 1980, it achieved internationally recognised independence as Zimbabwe, becoming a republic in the Commonwealth of Nations.

==Permanent administrators==
The term &quot;administrator&quot; is also used for a permanent officer representing the head of state where the appointment of a governor would be inappropriate; it is also used for the representative of a governor.

===Australia===

* In the Internal Northern Territory, the office of Administrator is a permanent appointment, and since the territory was granted self-government in 1978, the office of administrator has become a largely ceremonial appointment, like that of the governor in each state. Unlike the governors, who are appointed by the sovereign on advice of the premier, the administrator is appointed by the governor-general on advice of the prime minister after consultation with the chief minister.
* External territories such as Norfolk Island and Indian Ocean Territories (including Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands)
* Historically also on Lord Howe Island

There is no administrator in the Australian Capital Territory and the chief minister is elected by the legislative assembly.

===India===
In the Union territories of India, which are ruled directly by the Union government, the President of India appoints an administrator. Administrators differ from the governors of the states of India in that they are a representative of the president and not a head of state.

The president may also appoint the governor of a neighbouring state to be the administrator of a union territory. Since 1985 the Governor of Punjab has acted as the Administrator of Chandigarh. And Administrator of Lakshadweep also rules Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. In five union territories: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry; the administrator uses the title &quot;lieutenant governor&quot;.

===New Zealand===
*Tokelau has been governed by an administrator since 1949, when it was attached to New Zealand (previously it was part of the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands)
*Historically in Samoa as a League of Nations and United Nations mandate (see List of colonial governors of Samoa).

===United Kingdom overseas possessions===
*The civil Administrator of the Akrotiri and Dhekelia Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus is traditionally the military commander of British forces in the areas.
*The Administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory is the junior to a commissioner (Chagos Archipelago, notably Diego Garcia. He mandates the commander of British naval forces on Diego Garcia as his representative and justice of the peace.)
*The British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha consists of three equal constituent parts Saint Helena, Ascension Island, and Tristan da Cunha. The Governor of Saint Helena is &quot;ex officio&quot; also the Governor of Ascension and the Governor of Tristan da Cunha. Due to the distance of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha from Saint Helena, administrators are appointed to act on the respective governors behalf:
**Administrator of Ascension (since June 1964)
**Administrator of Tristan da Cunha (since 31 Jan 1950)

==Other==

===United States===

In the United States, the rank of &quot;administrator&quot; denotes a high-level civilian official within the United States federal government. Generally, an official of sub-cabinet rank, an administrator is appointed by the President of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and assigned to run a specific US government agency.

===Israel===
During mandatory times, the high commissioner was deputized by an administrator in case of high commissarial vacancy, and a deputy to the high commissioner when the high commissioner remained in office but temporarily could not fulfill his duties. Both posts were held &quot;ex-officio&quot; by the chief secretary. The rules for deputizing the analogous office in modern-day Israel, the president, are similar, with an interim president analogous to the administrator and an acting president analogous to the deputy to the high commissioner.

<doc id="242651" wikidata="Q1030150" url="?curid=242651" title="Campagnolo">
<text>Campagnolo is an Italian manufacturer of high-end bicycle components with headquarters in Vicenza, Italy. The components are organised as groupsets (gruppi), and are a near-complete collection of a bicycle&#x27;s mechanical parts. Campagnolo&#x27;s flagship components are the Super Record, Record, and Chorus groupsets with all three representing their recent shift to 12-speed drivetrains. Super Record and Record are the top groupsets, followed by Chorus, Potenza, Centaur and Veloce. Campagnolo also produces aluminum and carbon wheels, as well as other components (like carbon fiber seat posts, and bottle-cages).

==History==

Founded by Tullio Campagnolo, the company began in 1933 in a Vicenza workshop. The founder was a racing cyclist in Italy in the 1920s who conceived several ideas while racing, such as the quick release mechanism for bicycle wheels, derailleurs, and the rod gear for gear changing. Campagnolo has been awarded more than 135 patents for innovations in cycling technology.
At the end of the 1950s, Campagnolo started to manufacture magnesium parts such as wheels for sports cars like Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati and built chassis for NASA satellites in 1969. In 1963, Campagnolo produced a disc brake for the Innocenti Lambretta TV motorscooter - the first two-wheel production vehicle with such a brake. In the 1970s they also supplied wheels for Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One cars.

Campagnolo worked with the manufacturer Colnago and racer Eddy Merckx and produced lightweight parts for the bike he used to beat the world hour record in 1972. Merckx used Campagnolo exclusively and was a friend of Tullio Campagnolo.

Following Campagnolo&#x27;s success during the 1970s and &#x27;80s, innovation lagged as rival SunTour developed indexed shifting, Shimano combined shifter/brake levers (Shimano Total Integration), and FSA introduced compact chainsets. An unsuccessful foray into mountain biking, the overbuilt and heavy Euclid, Centaur and Olympus groupsets contributed to the company&#x27;s decline during those years. By the time the expensive Record O.R. (off-road) and Icarus MTB groupsets made it to the market, Campagnolo&#x27;s reputation was firmly cemented as a road bike brand. As a result, Campagnolo pulled out of the Mountain Bike market in 1994. Despite its struggles, Campagnolo introduced its ErgoPower combined shifter/brake levers and renewed its focus on high-end road cycling components.

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Campagnolo&#x27;s increased use of carbon fibre and titanium parts in groupsets and the development of wheelsets. In 2004, Campagnolo introduced a complete Compact drivetrain with smaller chainrings, to give lower gears than traditional drivetrains. Other innovations included a Hirth-joint engineered Ultra-Torque external-bearing crankset and G3 spoke lacing for racing wheels. In 2008, Campagnolo introduced 11-speed drivetrains with Super Record, Record, and Chorus groupsets. Campagnolo has released an electronic version of its drivetrain. In April 2018 Campagnolo launched 12-speed Record and Super Record groupsets, and in 2020, the company launched Campagnolo Ekar, a 13-speed groupset aimed at gravel riders.

Campagnolo has focused on road cycling and track cycling. The teams it sponsored for multiple years in the UCI ProTour were Lotto–Soudal, AG2R Citroën Team, UAE Team Emirates and Cofidis but lost them in the 2020s. Lotto-Soudal moved to Shimano for 2022, while UAE and Cofidis made the same jump a year later. 2024 AG2R has jumped across to Shimano as last ProTeam.

<text>The following is a chronological list of mayors of Berlin, the capital city and city-state of Germany. The mayors are the head of the city-state, part of the senate of Berlin.

== List==
=== Napoleonic Empire (1806–1809) ===
In 1806 the French occupants gathered 2,000 wealthy Berliners in St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Berlin, in order to elect the &quot;Grand conseil&quot; (grand council) of sixty members again electing the &quot;Comité administratif&quot; (administrative committee). This body of seven elected burghers was the provisional city government competent to carry out the orders of the occupation power, especially to raise the French war contributions by levying them mostly from the 2,000 eligible voters. The président of the committee was the Berlin-based Prussian publisher:

=== Lord Mayor of the Royal Capital Berlin (1809–1920) ===

<text>Roshan Seth (born 2 April 1942) is a British-Indian actor, writer and theatre director who has worked in the United Kingdom, United States and India. He began his acting career in the early 1960s in the UK, but left acting the following decade and moved to India to work as a journalist. In the 1980s, he rose to prominence for his comeback performance as Jawaharlal Nehru in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film &quot;Gandhi&quot;, which brought him a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and reignited his interest in acting.

He has since appeared in numerous British and American feature films and television programmes, with roles ranging from Chattar Lal in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, Amit Rao in &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, Papa Hussein in &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;, patriarch Jay in &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; and Dhalsim in &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;. He won the Genie Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for the Canadian film &quot;Such a Long Journey&quot;. Other projects he has appeared include &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot;, &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, &quot;Vertical Limit, Monsoon Wedding, Proof, Ek Tha Tiger, Indian Summers&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot;.

==Early life==
Seth was born in Patna, Bihar on 2 April 1942 during the British Raj, to a Hindu father and a Muslim mother. His father was a biochemistry professor at Patna Medical College. He was educated at The Doon School, then did graduate studies in history at St Stephen&#x27;s College. There, he honed his theatrical skills at the Shakespeare Society, before moving to England for further training. He trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 1965 and started working in British television and repertory theatre.

==Career==
Seth first appeared in Peter Brook&#x27;s production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which toured in 1972. Seth entered feature films in Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1974). However, subsequent filmmakers only wanted Seth for limited ethnic roles, so that his career stalled.

Discouraged, Seth abandoned acting and returned to India in 1977, where he worked as a journalist and editor of the quarterly journal published by the India International Centre, Delhi. He took leave from this job after Richard Attenborough asked Seth to play Jawaharlal Nehru in &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982). Seth was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in the film. Seth subsequently also played Jawaharlal Nehru in &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot;, a 53-episode series on Doordarshan in 1988.

David Hare met Seth in Delhi in 1982, and asked him to play author Victor Mehta in Hare&#x27;s biographical play &quot;A Map of the World&quot;. Seth left his editing job and returned to acting. &quot;A Map of the World&quot; toured for several years in Australia, London, and New York. After the release of the multi-award-winning movie &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), Seth was much in demand, and when &quot;A Map of the World&quot;&#x27;s Broadway run finished, his movie career took off. His work in 1984 included major roles in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and David Lean&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. Following that he played a lead in &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; (1985), and he played Pancks in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1988).

Seth&#x27;s film credits in the 1990s included roles in &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot; (1991), &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; (1991), &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1994), and Harish Saluja&#x27;s &quot;The Journey&quot; (1997). In 1993, he played the role of Haroon Amir in the television miniseries &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot;, for which he was nominated a Royal Television Society award for &quot;Best Actor – Male&quot;. In 1995, he played the role of Baba in &quot;Flight&quot;, for which he won the &quot;Best Actor&quot; award at the Sochi International Film Festival. In 1998, he played the leading role of Gustad Noble in the film &quot;Such a Long Journey&quot;, for which he won the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.

In 2001, Seth appeared in &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot; and he has continued working steadily in British and American films. In 2003 he played the lead in the American film &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, which was broadcast nationally on PBS. He also recently returned to mainstream Indian cinema with his role in the 2012 film, &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot;.

==Personal life==
Seth was married to author Pepita Seth, but they separated in the late 1980s and divorced in 2004. His brother is the retired Indian diplomat Aftab Seth.

He acted in more than 450 films, established himself as one of the most popular and iconic actors in Indian cinema. Puri is remembered for playing various roles in a variety of film genres, especially iconic villainous roles in Hindi cinema, as well as international cinema. He reigned supreme in villainous roles in the 1980s and 1990s, when his dominating screen presence and distinctive deep voice made him stand out amongst the other villains of the day. Puri was active in both art cinema such as in some of Shyam Benegal and Govind Nihalani&#x27;s films as well as in mainstream cinema. Puri won three Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actor in eight nominations. He also holds most Filmfare Award for Best Villain nominations.

His comic role in &quot;Chachi 420&quot;, that he acted alongside Kamal Haasan was well received by critics.

Puri was a highly prolific actor; he also featured in positive supporting roles, of which he won 3 times Filmfare Awards for Best Supporting Actor. Some of his notable positive roles are &quot;Phool Aur Kaante&quot; (1991), &quot;Gardish&quot; (1993), &quot;Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&quot; (1995), &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;Diljale&quot; (1996) &quot;Pardes&quot; (1997), &quot;Virasat&quot; (1997), &quot;China Gate&quot; (1998), &quot;Badal&quot; (2000), &quot;Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai&quot; (2001), &quot;Mujhse Shaadi Karogi&quot; (2004) and &quot;Hulchul&quot; (2004). To foreign audiences, he is best known as Mola Ram in the Steven Spielberg and George Lucas&#x27; Hollywood film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984) and in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) as Dada Abdulla Hajee Adab, President of the Natal Indian Congress.

== Early life ==
Amrish Lal Puri was born in a Punjabi Hindu family in Nawanshahr, Punjab, to Lala Nihal Chand and Ved Kaur. He had four siblings, elder brothers Chaman Puri and Madan Puri (both of whom were also actors), elder sister Chandrakanta, and a younger brother, Harish Puri. He was the first cousin of the actor and singer K. L. Saigal.

== Career ==
Puri acted in more than 450 films between 1967 and 2005, most of which were commercially successful, and was one of the most successful villains in Bollywood. Yet, his early years were marked by relentless struggle and he was nearly fifty years of age before he first played a leading character (as main villain) in a film.

Puri&#x27;s family had some film connections. The singer and actor K. L. Saigal, one of the pioneers of Indian cinema, was Puri&#x27;s first cousin. Enamoured by the fame of their cousin, Puri&#x27;s older brothers, Chaman Puri and Madan Puri, had moved to Mumbai in the 1950s to try their luck in films and had found work as character actors. Puri likewise came to Mumbai in the mid-1950s to try his luck, but failed his first screen test. He however managed to land a stable job with the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), a government organization, and indulged his hobby of acting by becoming part of an amateur &quot;natak mandali&quot; or stage group. His group often performed at the Prithvi Theatre in plays written by Satyadev Dubey. He eventually became well known as a stage actor and even won the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1979. This theatre recognition soon led to work in television advertisements and eventually to films at the relatively late age of 40 (forty).

This was in the early 1970s, and he hardly had a dialogue to utter in his first few films, which is remarkable, because his baritone voice was to be his source of fame in later years. These bit appearances were still counted a hobby, since he continued with his government job in order to support his family. Throughout the 1970s, Puri worked in supporting roles, usually as the henchman of the main villain. The super-hit movie &quot;Hum Paanch&quot; (1980) was the first film in which he played the main villain. His acting performance, personality and voice were all noticed and duly appreciated in this film. After that, he started getting cast as the main villain in other movies. Puri went on to work in Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil and even Hollywood films. His main field was, of course, Hindi cinema.

In 1982, Puri played the main villain, Jagavar Choudhary in the Subhash Ghai super-hit film &quot;Vidhaata&quot;. That year, he again played the main villain, JK in the movie &quot;Shakti&quot; co-starring Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Next, in 1983, Ghai again cast him as the main villain, Pasha, in the hit movie &quot;Hero&quot;. Puri regularly featured in subsequent Ghai films.

He is known to international audiences for his roles as the main antagonist Mola Ram in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984) and as Gandhi&#x27;s Muslim employer and patron in South Africa in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982). For &quot;Indiana Jones,&quot; he shaved his head and it created such an impression that he kept his head shaved thereafter. His baldness gave him the flexibility to experiment with different looks as a villain in subsequent movies, and few are aware that in every film thereafter, Puri was wearing a wig. Puri and Spielberg shared a great rapport and Spielberg often said in interviews: &quot;Amrish is my favorite villain. The best the world has ever produced and ever will!&quot;

Puri reigned supreme in villainous roles in the 1980s and 1990s. His dominating screen presence and baritone voice made him stand out amongst the other villains of the day. In villainous roles, Puri is best remembered as &quot;Mogambo&quot; in &quot;Mr. India&quot;, &quot;Jagavar&quot; in &quot;Vidhaata&quot;, &quot;Thakral&quot; in &quot;Meri Jung&quot;, &quot;Bhujang&quot; in &quot;Tridev&quot;, &quot;Balwant Rai&quot; in &quot;Ghayal&quot;, Barrister Chadda in &quot;Damini&quot; and &quot;Thakur Durjan Singh&quot; in &quot;Karan Arjun&quot;. His comic role in &quot;Chachi 420&quot;, that he acted alongside Kamal Haasan was highly appreciated.

From the 1990s until his death in 2005, Puri also featured in positive supporting roles in many movies. Some of his notable positive roles are &quot;Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&quot;, &quot;Phool Aur Kaante&quot;, &quot;Gardish&quot;, &quot;Pardes&quot;, &quot;Virasat&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai&quot;, &quot;China Gate&quot;. He received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor award for &quot;Meri Jung&quot; and &quot;Virasat&quot;.

== Illness and death ==
Puri was suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome, a rare kind of blood cancer, and had undergone brain surgery for his condition after he was admitted to the Hinduja Hospital on 27 December 2004. His condition required frequent removal of the blood accumulated in the cerebral region of the brain and after some time he slipped into a coma. Puri died around 7:30 a.m on 12 January 2005.

His body was brought to his residence for people to pay their last respects, and his funeral was on 13 January 2005 at Shivaji Park crematorium.

On 22 June 2019, Puri was honoured with a Google Doodle. Commemorating his 87th birthday, Google carried his picture and the accompanying text read as, &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, try, try again—and you might end up like Indian film actor Amrish Puri, who overcame an early setback on the way to fulfilling his big screen dreams.&quot;

<doc id="242656" wikidata="Q440176" url="?curid=242656" title="Salmonella Dub">
<text>Salmonella Dub is a dub/drum n bass/reggae/roots band from New Zealand. The band was formed in 1992 by Andrew Penman, Dave Deakins, and Mark Tyler. The band has toured extensively throughout New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

==History==
The original Salmonella Dub line-up was formed in 1992 in Christchurch. They played their first gig in January 1993 at the Westport racecourse. The &#x27;Dubbies&#x27; have been called the pioneers and originators of a unique Pacific style of dub/drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass/reggae/hip hop and groove-based rock containing elements of the Polynesian hip hop style known as Urban Pasifika, along with other influential 90s bands like Hallelujah Picassos, Nemesis Dub Systems, Unitone HiFi, and Supergroove. The band helped foster and tour acts like Fat Freddy’s Drop, Shapeshifter, Cornerstone Roots, Kora, and Trinity Roots, as well as the new wave of Australian acts like Budspells, Rastawookie, King Tide, Red Eyes, and the likes, can all thank Salmonella Dub for breaking new ground, in an Australasian alternative music scene which was dominated through most of the 1990s by straight guitar rock, and electronic dance music. For many years, the band has been connected to the small north Canterbury town of Kaikōura, where they have their studio, and where they helped found the Kaikoura Roots festival.

The group worked for some time with MC Tiki Taane, who began mixing their live sets in 1996, and later joined the band onstage to rap, sing, and play guitar. After developing a profile with the band, Taane embarked on a solo career in 2007. Also in 2007 was the exit of saxophone player Conan Wilcox, the author of the dubs horn lines to that point. Other guest or collaborative artists have included Paddy Free (of Pitch Black) who produced the most recent album release Freak Controller and performed with the band, and guests Whirimako Black, Hirini Melbourne, Richard Nunns and MC Mana. The band has also collaborated with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and Hamish McKeich.

The recent touring entourage includes the originators: Andrew Penman, David Deakins, Mark Tyler with Guests, Michelle Harrison, The Mighty Asterix, Scotty Taitoko, Simon Kay, Brent Thompson, Laughton Kora.
In February 2008, Salmonella Dub and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra collaborated for the &quot;Feel The Seasons Change&quot; tour of New Zealand with shows performed in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Nelson. The &quot;Feel The Seasons Change&quot; project combined Salmonella Dub’s contemporary music and production values with elements of Te Reo Māori, the ancient arts of taonga pūoro (traditional Maori instruments) and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s classical music tradition.

In the year 2000, the band won 8 bNet awards for the album &quot;Killervision&quot; alongside 4 awards at the NZ Tui awards. 
In 2002 their album &quot;Inside the Dubplates&quot; won 4 awards at the Tui&#x27;s. The irony being the remix album &quot;Outside the Dubplates&quot; picked up the best downbeat album while bNet gave it the award for best dance album.

&quot;United by background images of our geography and history, the omnipresent birdsong of Richard Nunns on traditional Maori instruments, and the outstanding vocals of jazz-blues singer Whirimako Black, the collaboration was certainly intriguing if for its sheer scale. Between songs, conductor Hamish McKeich was careful not to trip over his players, squeezed onto two-thirds of the stage; Salmonella Dub looked oddly well-behaved and vulnerable standing next to them.&quot;

At the New Zealand Radio Awards in 2009, Radio New Zealand became the first noncommercial radio station to win the Supreme Award including Best Technical Production, Studio, or Outside Broadcast Recording with &quot;Feel the Seasons Change – Live with the NZSO&quot;.

The band released the single &quot;Same Home Town&quot; in 2013 in honour of their 20th birthday. The single is dedicated to the Dux de Lux, the early Christchurch venue for the band.

The band released their latest album &quot;For All Things Alive&quot; Featuring guest vocalists Whirimako Black, Troy Kingi, Nino Birch and The Mighty Asterix.The first 8 tracks Disc 1 of SALMONELLA DUB’s long awaited new 15 track digi-album, out now!the final 7 tunes Disc 2 set for release 5 November 2024.

<text>Akhisar () is a municipality and district of Manisa Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,645 km2, and its population is 177,419 (2022). It is the site of the ancient city of Thyatira.

With archaeological findings that are proving settlements going back to 3000 BC, Akhisar has been a busy trade center with its strategic location at the intersection of important roads during ancient and medieval ages. Akhisar also hosted one of the Seven churches of Asia: Thyatira, which is mentioned in the Bible. Akhisar maintained its importance as a regional trade center during the Ottoman period.

Today&#x27;s Akhisar is still the trade and business center in its region. Akhisar&#x27;s name is internationally associated with tobacco. The fertile Akhisar Plain produces about 10% of total Turkish tobacco production. Akhisar&#x27;s high-quality olives and olive oil are also globally known. Olive, walnut and almond cultivation is among the important agricultural activities of Akhisar.

==History==
===Ancient history===

The town was the most important center in ancient North Lydia. Findings suggest a possible earlier period of pre-eminence under the Hittites. Persian occupation of the region took place around 500 BC. Thyateira was later conquered by Alexander the Great. In later years, Thyateira was captured successively by the Seleucid Empire, the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, and by Mithridates VI of Pontus, until the Roman Era that started in 80 BC.

In 214 AD, the Roman Emperor Caracalla promoted the town to the status of a regional and administrative center with powers of adjudication (conventus). The city flourished considerably under the Romans and became a large metropolis with 3 gymnasiums. As of the 2nd century AD, Christianity spread in western Anatolia by the actions of apostles like John the Evangelist and Paul. Thyatira is mentioned twice in the New Testament. The Book of Acts refers to a woman of Thyatira named Lydia (Acts 16:14), though the Apostle Paul converted her to Christ in Philippi of Macedonia, not Thyatira. The other occurrence is as one of the Seven Churches of Asia, in the church of which was a woman identified as a prophetess and called &quot;Jezebel&quot; for deceiving some of the Christians there into compromising with idolatry and committing sexual immorality (Revelation 2:18-29).
After the partition of the Roman Empire in 395 and the upcoming of Islam at the beginning of the 7th century, raids by Arabs resulted in great loss of land for Byzantium and the region of Thyatira witnessed many battles between Byzantine and Arab forces.

Thyatira was repeatedly attacked by the Arabs and later by the Turks, however it was rebuilt over the ruins. In the 12th century, a large-scale inflow of Turkish tribes started. Thyatira swayed back and forth between Byzantine and Turkish rulers during for two centuries. In the 14th century, Turks under the Anatolian Beylik of Saruhan conquered all Western Anatolian lands and Thyatira went under Turkish rule in 1307. Towards the end of the same century, Akhisar became part of the extending Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman administration, Thyatira was at first a subdistrict (&quot;kaza&quot;) in the sanjak (&quot;district&quot;) of Saruhan (corresponding to present-day Manisa Province) within the larger vilayet (&quot;province&quot;) of Kütahya.

===Modern period===
Akhisar continued its development in the 17th century. However, since the second half of the 16th century, the Celâlî rebellions in the region took the city under its influence. For this reason, the city walls were repaired at the beginning of the 17th century. Due to the Celali rebellions, some of the people in the vicinity settled here and the population of the city increased. As a matter of fact, Evliya Çelebi writes that in 1671 the city had twenty-four neighbourhoods and 2600 houses, most of which were covered with tiles. He also records that there were forty-seven mosques, three hamams, about 1000 shops, one bedesten, ten inns, seven madrasas and twenty-three primary schools, and that it is surrounded by vineyards, gardens and orchards. He also states that there is an old castle ruin on the hill in the middle of the city and that the city was surrounded by walls for fear of the Celâlî named Karayazıcı.

In October 1895 newly resettled Muslims from Bulgaria attacked and massacred members of the local Armenian community. The Saruhan Eyalet was later incorporated into the vilayet of Aydın until the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1922.

During the course of the Greco-Turkish War (1919-22) the Greek Army invaded the town on June 5, 1919. Due to the developments of the campaign, which included unrest from the Turkish populace, the Greek forces withdrew on June 10, 1919. Soon after, Greek forces re-invaded Akhisar during the Greek Summer Offensive on June 22, 1920. The Turkish Nationalist forces captured the town on September 6, 1922, toward the end of the Great Offensive. Athanasios Karathanasis in his book wrote that following the capture, an estimated 7,000 local Greeks were killed in Kırtık dere. The remaining were party to the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Furthermore, although the local Muslims had sworn on the Quran that they would protect the remaining Armenian community upon the arrival of the Turkish army in town, they instead cooperated with them in plundering and massacring the Armenians.

===Historical demographics===
According to demographic statistics of 1917, the district of Akhisar had a total population of 39,157 prior to World War I, with 32,280 being Muslims, 5,877 Greeks, 515 Armenians, and 485 Jews. At the end of 1917, or at the beginning of 1918, the total population of the district was 38,706; of this population, 31,936 were Muslims, 5,782 were Greeks, 506 were Armenians, and 485 were Jews. According to Greek statistics in 1921 during the occupation, the district of Akhisar had a total population of 56,986, with 48,356 being Turks, 7,638 Greeks, 489 Armenians, and 503 Jews.

==Climate==
Akhisar has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with very hot, dry summers, and cool to mild, moderately wet winters.

==Features==

In ancient times, Thyateira was an important center of activity. It was on the ancient roads from Byzantium to Pergamum, Sardis, and Ephesus. Thyateira was at the center of many small towns and villages which were administratively and politically bound to it. Cloth and pottery trade was the main activity in town. Production of wool, linen, brass goods, and tanning were other commercial activities. The city remained as a center of trade activity for centuries. Akhisar&#x27;s cloth and cords were reputable in Istanbul markets. Among the other agricultural merchandise were olives, olive oil, water melons, grapes, and raisins.

This high level of economical activity made Akhisar the most important subdistrict within the sanjak of Saruhan. The first Ottoman records about Akhisar date back to the 16th century. These records indicate that Akhisar was a district center which paid 40% more income tax than the seat of the Saruhan Sanjak, present-day Manisa. At the end of the 19th century, urban population had reached 30,000. In the Republican era, Akhisar pursued its development. Many modern avenues and streets were built. In recent years , a new stadium and grass soccer field were built, along with many parks and recreational areas. Many banks, shops and tourist hotels are now lined up along the busy main street (Tahir Un Avenue) which connects the train station to the city center.

An industrial zone specializing in automotive repair and small parts production, along with a number of factories such as olive oil production plants, brick factories, tobacco (cigarette) factories were constructed. The Greater Akhisar Industrial Zone is currently under development. Since the city is located on the State Highway 565 between İzmir and Istanbul—Turkey&#x27;s two most important ports—Akhisar Industrial Zone offers attractive investment opportunities for both domestic and foreign investors.

Today chess is very popular in Akhisar. Every year during the Caglak Festival hundreds of children participate in chess events. In 2009 the World Youth Under 16 Chess Olympiad was held in Akhisar from September 24 through October 3.

==Historical sites==

Ancient Akhisar is almost entirely covered by the buildings and streets of the modern town. However, buildings and ruins from ancient times and the Middle Ages can still be seen all over the town. One is very likely to see ancient stones or columnheads in street corners in the older city.

===Tomb of State Hospital===
This is a man-made tomb in the city center with Hellenistic ruins. However, some houseware findings on this hill reveal the existence of some primitive settlements dating back to 9000 BC. Archeologists assume that the hill once hosted the acropol of ancient Thyateira. The Byzantine and Turkish names of the city were derived from the white painted towers on this castle. (Turkish name Akhisar, in Turkish: Ak = white + hisar = castle or, Byzantine name Asprokastro, in Greek Aspro=white + kastro=castle). This small hill has hosted the State Hospital since World War II. Today, a Hellenistic tablet and sarcophagus can be seen in the hospital garden.

===Tepemezari===
Some ruins of an ancient building complex and colonnaded road can be seen in &quot;Tepemezari&quot; area in downtown. The portico is estimated to have a length of . It possibly connects the entrance of the large ancient building complex to the city acropolis. Tepemezarlığı was subjected to an in depth archaeological excavation between 1969 and 1971. These excavations revealed the walls of a rectangular Roman building along north–south direction with dimensions of about . The compound has been arranged into an archaeological park near downtown.

===Akhisar coins===
It is generally admitted that money was invented by Lydians in the 7th century BC in western Anatolia. Thyateira, being the most important center in the North ancient Lydia, was definitely one of the first towns where money was used. Towards 200 BC, important trade centers started minting their own coins.

Oldest Thyateira coin is made of bronze and belongs to times when the rule of Pergamon was prevalent. Thyateira coins usually display the figures of Apollo and Artemis on one side and a double sided axe on the other. During 50s AD, Thyateira printed coins bearing figures of Roman emperors, local governors and city administrators. Roman coins also revealed some sports activities and festivals in Thyateira.

Some of the coins found indicate that there was once an economic alliance between Thyateira, Smyrna (İzmir) and Pergamon (Bergama).

===Falcon Rock===
The Sahin Kaya or &quot;Falcon Rock&quot; is a big high rock in the Eastern county territory. It hosts some ancient and middle age ruins. This big mass of rock has a very strategic location controlling the Akhisar and Pergamon plains, a large part of the Lydian territories. The location and castle indicate that the settlement was a defensive sentinel station. Access is possible by a tough walk of 3,050 steps up an ancient stairway carved into the rock.

===Lydian tombs===
The man-made tombs along modern Akhisar – Gölmarmara road are ancient Lydian graves. These tombs usually have one single grave room.

Similar tombs can also be seen near modern villages of Beyoba, Mecidiye, Süleymanlı and Eroğlu. There are also a number of Lydian and Phrygian graves carved in rock.

===Ulucami (The Great Mosque)===
This ancient building was transformed to a mosque in the 15th century. The year of construction is unknown but it is evident that the building was formerly a Byzantine church and possibly an earlier Roman temple. There is even a possibility for the building to be one of the famous Seven Churches of Christianity.

===Aynali Mosque===
Aynali Mosque was almost reconstructed in 1958 due to excessive wear. Some ancient columns and building blocks found in the garden suggests that there was a large building of ancient Thyateira in the area. Mosque garden also hosts the finest samples of the Turkish art of stone carving.

===Zeynelzade Library and Hashoca Mosque===
The library was constructed in 1798 by Zeynelzade&#x27;s, a reputable family of Akhisar. The building is located in Hashoca Quarter, close to Hashoca Mosque. According to records of 1805, there were 923 volumes of manuscripts. A modern library with the same name was constructed in the 20th century in another part of the city, serving students and researchers.

===Jewish graveyard===
Next to the Reşat Bey Cemetery, there is a Jewish Graveyard of about 673 square meters (7200 ft²). Gravestones with carvings in Hebrew can be seen.

===Jewish synagogue===
Right behind the modern Turkish Telecom Directorate Building there is an historical synagogue. Unfortunately, not much remained except its old gate.

===Kayalıoğlu Jewish school===

The School of Agriculture built by the Jewish family of Kayalıoglu is still in good shape. The building was built in the beginning of the 20th century. The 3 story building has been recently abandoned. There are orchards and various trees surrounding the building, once used in practical studies. The basement of the building served as a winery. The building and yard occupies an area of about . Other small buildings accompany the old school building.

<doc id="242660" wikidata="Q173343" url="?curid=242660" title="Weddell Sea">
<text>The Weddell Sea is part of the Southern Ocean and contains the Weddell Gyre. Its land boundaries are defined by the bay formed from the coasts of Coats Land and the Antarctic Peninsula. The easternmost point is Cape Norvegia at Princess Martha Coast, Queen Maud Land. To the east of Cape Norvegia is the King Haakon VII Sea. Much of the southern part of the sea is covered by a permanent, massive ice shelf field, the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf.

The sea is contained within the two overlapping Antarctic territorial claims of Argentine Antarctica, the British Antarctic Territory, and also resides partially within the Antarctic Chilean Territory. At its widest the sea is around across, and its area is around .

Various ice shelves, including the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, fringe the Weddell sea. Some of the ice shelves on the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula, which formerly covered roughly of the Weddell Sea, had completely disappeared by 2002. The Weddell Sea has been deemed by scientists to have the clearest water of any sea. Researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, on finding a Secchi disc visible at a depth of on , ascertained that the clarity corresponded to that of distilled water.

In his 1950 book &quot;The White Continent&quot;, historian Thomas R. Henry writes: &quot;The Weddell Sea is, according to the testimony of all who have sailed through its berg-filled waters, the most treacherous and dismal region on Earth. The Ross Sea is relatively peaceful, predictable, and safe.&quot; He continues for an entire chapter, relating myths of the green-haired merman sighted in the sea&#x27;s icy waters, the inability of crews to navigate a path to the coast until 1949, and treacherous &quot;flash freezes&quot; that left ships, such as Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s , at the mercy of the ice floes.

==Etymology==
The sea is named after the Scottish sailor James Weddell (1787-1834), who entered the sea in 1823 and originally named it after King George IV; it was renamed in Weddell&#x27;s honour in 1900. Also in 1823, the American sealing captain Benjamin Morrell claimed to have seen land some 10–12° east of the sea&#x27;s actual eastern boundary. He called this New South Greenland, but its existence was disproved when the sea was more fully explored in the early 20th century. Weddell got as far south as 74°S; the furthest southern penetration since Weddell but before the modern era was made by William Speirs Bruce in 1903.

The Weddell Sea is an important area of deep water mass formation through cabbeling, the main driving force of the thermohaline circulation. Deepwater masses are also formed through cabbeling in the North Atlantic and are caused by differences in temperature and salinity of the water. In the Weddell sea, this is brought about mainly by brine exclusion and wind cooling.

==History==
In 1823, British sailor James Weddell discovered the Weddell Sea. Otto Nordenskiöld, leader of the 1901–1904 Swedish Antarctic Expedition, spent a winter at Snow Hill with a team of four men when the relief ship became beset in ice and was crushed. The crew managed to reach Paulet Island where they wintered in a primitive hut. Nordenskiöld and the others were eventually picked up by the Argentine Navy at Hope Bay. All but one survived the ordeal.

The Antarctic Sound is named after the expedition ship of Otto Nordenskiöld. The sound that separates the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula from Dundee Island is also referred to as &quot;Iceberg Alley&quot;, because of the huge icebergs that are often seen here. Snowhill Island, located east of the Antarctic Peninsula is almost completely snow-capped, hence its name. The Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskiöld built a cabin on the island in 1902, where Nordenskiöld and three members of the expedition had to spend two winters.

In 1915, Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s ship, , got trapped and was crushed by ice in this sea. After 15 months on the pack-ice Shackleton and his men managed to reach Elephant Island and safely returned home. In March 2022, it was announced that the well-preserved wreck of the &quot;Endurance&quot; had been discovered from its anticipated location, at a depth of .

==Geology==
As with other neighboring parts of Antarctica, the Weddell Sea shares a common geological history with southernmost South America. In southern Patagonia at the onset of the Andean orogeny in the Jurassic extensional tectonics created the Rocas Verdes Basin, a back-arc basin whose surviving southeastward extension forms the Weddell Sea. In the Late Cretaceous the tectonic regime of Rocas Verdes Basin changed leading to its transformation into a compressional foreland basin – the Magallanes Basin – in the Cenozoic. While this happened in South America the Weddell Sea part of the basin escaped compressional tectonics and remained an oceanic basin.

==Oceanography==
The Weddell Sea is one of few locations in the World Ocean where deep and bottom water masses are formed to contribute to the global thermohaline circulation which has been warming slowly over the last decade. The characteristics of exported water masses result from complex interactions between surface forcing, significantly modified by sea ice processes, ocean dynamics at the continental shelf break, and slope and sub-ice shelf water mass transformation.

Circulation in the western Weddell Sea is dominated by a northward flowing current. This northward current is the western section of a primarily wind-driven, cyclonic gyre called the Weddell Gyre. This northward flow serves as the primary force of departure of water from the Weddell Sea, a major site of ocean water modification and deep water formation, to the remainder of the World Ocean. The Weddell Gyre is a cold, low salinity surface layer separated by a thin, weak pycnocline from a thick layer of relatively warm and salty water referred to as Weddell Deep Water (WDW), and a cold bottom layer.

Circulation in the Weddell Sea has proven difficult to quantify. Geopotential surface heights above the 1000 dB level, computed using historical data, show only very weak surface currents. Similar computations carried out using more closely spaced data also showed small currents. Closure of the gyre circulation was assumed to be driven by Sverdrup transport. The Weddell Sea is a major site for deep water formation.

Thus, in addition to a wind-driven gyre component of the boundary current, a deeper circulation whose dynamics and transports reflect an input of dense water in the southern and southwestern Weddell Sea are expected. Available data does not lend to the quantification of the volume transports associated with this western boundary region, or to the determination of deep convective circulation along the western boundary.

==Climate==
The predominance of strong surface winds parallel to the narrow and tall mountain range of the Antarctic Peninsula is a remarkable feature of weather and climate in the area of the western Weddell Sea. The winds carry cold air toward lower latitudes and turn into southwesterlies farther north.

These winds are of interest not only because of their effect on the temperature regime east of the peninsula but also because they force the drift of ice northeastward into the South Atlantic Ocean as the last branch of the clockwise circulation in the lower layers of the atmosphere along the coasts of the Weddell Sea. The sharp contrast between the wind, temperature, and ice conditions of the two sides of the Antarctic Peninsula has been well known for many years.

Strong surface winds directed equatorward along the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula can appear in two different types of synoptic-meteorological situations: an intense cyclone over the central Weddell Sea, a broad east to west flow of stable cold air in the lowest 500-to-1000-metre layer of the atmosphere over the central and/or southern Weddell Sea toward the peninsula. These conditions lead to cold air piling up on the east edge of the mountains. This process leads to the formation of a high-pressure ridge over the peninsula (mainly east of the peak) and, therefore, a deflection of the originally westward current of air to the right, along the mountain wall.

==Ecology==
The Weddell Sea is abundant with whales and seals. Characteristic fauna of the sea include the Weddell seal and killer whales, humpback whales, minke whales, leopard seals, and crabeater seals are frequently seen during Weddell Sea voyages.

The Adélie penguin is the dominant penguin species in this remote area because of their adaptation to the harsh environment. A colony of more than 100,000 pairs of Adélies can be found on volcanic Paulet Island.

Around 1997, the northernmost emperor penguin colony was discovered just south of Snowhill Island in the Weddell Sea. As the Weddell Sea is often clogged with heavy pack-ice, strong ice-class vessels equipped with helicopters are required to reach this colony.

In 2021, sponges and other unidentified suspension feeders were reported to have been found growing under the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf on a boulder at a depth of 1,233 m (872 of which were ice), 260 km from open water.

In February 2021 the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research with RV Polarstern, a colony of approximately 60 million Jonah&#x27;s icefish was found to inhabit an area in the Weddell Sea. It is estimated that the colony covers around 240 square kilometers, with an average of one nest per every three square meters.

<doc id="242664" wikidata="Q7625316" url="?curid=242664" title="Strumble Head Lighthouse">
<text>Strumble Head Lighthouse stands on Ynys Meicel (from Welsh: St. Michael&#x27;s Island), also known as Strumble Head, a rocky island at the northwest corner of Pencaer area, five miles west of the town of Fishguard, in northern Pembrokeshire, Wales.

== History ==
The present lighthouse was erected in 1908, but the first proposal to build a lighthouse here was made in 1825 by Trinity House. The lighthouse replaces a light-vessel previously moored in the south of Cardigan Bay. The lighthouse is similar in construction to Skokholm Lighthouse and is among the last lighthouses to be built in Britain.

The circular stone tower is 55 ft high and still contains the original lantern complete with Fresnel lens manufactured by Chance Brothers, using a mercury bath as a low-friction bearing. Illumination was updated from paraffin to electricity in 1949. The Lighthouse was fully electrified in 1965. The Lighthouse was fully automated in 1980 and is now monitored from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre at Harwich with regular visits made by an attendant.

A plaque in the lantern-room is inscribed with a verse from Psalm 127:
&quot;Except the Lord Build the house&quot;
&quot;They labour in vain that build it&quot;
&quot;Except the Lord keep the city&quot;
&quot;The Watchman waketh but in vain&quot;
Under the lantern room sits a water tank which was used to store rainfall for use in the lighthouse&#x27;s accommodation. The Lighthouse was reached by an iron bridge, and a handrail on the bridge and steps formed part pipe siphoning fuel mainland. Parts of the apparatus still survive. The bridge was replaced in 1963. An electric fog-signal was installed in 1969, replacing the previous system that used explosive signal charges. Stores were transferred from the mainland by cable but now largely arrive by helicopter and a helipad is found to the west of the lighthouse.

Those familiar with transatlantic aviation may recognize the name from Strumble VOR.

<text>A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another. Usually a transducer converts a signal in one form of energy to a signal in another.
Transducers are often employed at the boundaries of automation, measurement, and control systems, where electrical signals are converted to and from other physical quantities (energy, force, torque, light, motion, position, etc.). The process of converting one form of energy to another is known as transduction.

==Types==
* Mechanical transducers convert physical quantities into mechanical outputs or vice versa;
* Electrical transducers convert physical quantities into electrical outputs or signals. Examples of these are:
** a thermocouple that changes temperature differences into a small voltage;
** a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), used to measure displacement (position) changes by means of electrical signals.

==Sensors, actuators and transceivers==
Transducers can be categorized by the direction information passes through them:
* A &quot;sensor&quot; is a transducer that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus from a physical system. It produces a signal, which represents information about the system, which is used by some type of telemetry, information or control system. 
* An &quot;actuator&quot; is a device that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is controlled by a signal from a control system or manual control. It is operated by a source of energy, which can be mechanical force, electrical current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion. An actuator is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electrical system), software-based (e.g. a printer driver, robot control system), a human, or any other input.
* &quot;Bidirectional&quot; transducers can convert physical phenomena to electrical signals and electrical signals into physical phenomena. An example of an inherently bidirectional transducer is an antenna, which can convert radio waves (electromagnetic waves) into an electrical signal to be processed by a radio receiver, or translate an electrical signal from a transmitter into radio waves. Another example is a voice coil, which is used in loudspeakers to translate an electrical audio signal into sound, and in dynamic microphones to translate sound waves into an audio signal.
* &quot;Transceivers&quot; integrate simultaneous bidirectional functionality. The most ubiquitous example are likely radio transceivers (called &quot;transponders&quot; in aircraft), used in virtually every form of wireless (tele-)communications and network device connections. Another example is ultrasound transceivers that are used for instance in medical ultrasound (echo) scans.

===Active vs passive transducers===
Passive transducers require an external power source to operate, which is called an excitation signal. The signal is modulated by the sensor to produce an output signal. For example, a thermistor does not generate any electrical signal, but by passing an electric current through it, its resistance can be measured by detecting variations in the current or voltage across the thermistor.

Active transducers in contrast, generate electric current in response to an external stimulus which serves as the output signal without the need of an additional energy source. Such examples are a photodiode, and a piezoelectric sensor, photovoltic, thermocouple.

==Characteristics==
Some specifications that are used to rate transducers:
*Dynamic range: This is the ratio between the largest amplitude signal and the smallest amplitude signal the transducer can effectively translate. Transducers with larger dynamic range are more &quot;sensitive&quot; and precise.
*Repeatability: This is the ability of the transducer to produce an identical output when stimulated by the same input. 
*Noise: All transducers add some random noise to their output. In electrical transducers this may be electrical noise due to thermal motion of charges in circuits. Noise corrupts small signals more than large ones.
*Hysteresis: This is a property in which the output of the transducer depends not only on its current input but its past input. For example, an actuator which uses a gear train may have some backlash, which means that if the direction of motion of the actuator reverses, there will be a dead zone before the output of the actuator reverses, caused by play between the gear teeth.

<doc id="242667" wikidata="Q1770495" url="?curid=242667" title="Goodwick">
<text>Goodwick (; ) is a coastal town in Pembrokeshire, Wales, immediately west of its twin town of Fishguard.

Fishguard and Goodwick form a community that wraps around Fishguard Bay. As well as the two towns, it consists of Dyffryn, Stop-and-Call, Harbour Village, Lower Town, and Penyraber. A Goodwick electoral ward exists covering the town with a total population of 1,988 at the 2011 census.

==History==

During the Viking Age, the coasts of Wales were subjected to raids in the latter 10th century. Norse trading posts and settlements were established. The name probably derives from a combination of the old Norse forms: &quot;góðr&quot; (good) and &quot;vik&quot; (bay or cove) giving &quot;góðrvik&quot;. Compare formation with Reykjavík (Smoking Bay) where &quot;reykr&quot; = &#x27;smoke&#x27;. The southeast facing hillside of Goodwick is sheltered from prevailing and salty SW winds and therefore naturally well tree-covered compared with the exposed headland above and the wet land of the bay. Many older developments in Goodwick have the name &#x27;Goedwig&#x27; meaning forest - Goedwig Terrace, Villas, Chapel etc. Thus an alternative explanation for the name may be that it was Goedwig and Goorvik may just have been a happy coincidence for the invaders.

Goodwick was a small fishing village in the parish of Llanwnda, but in 1887 work commenced on a railway connection and harbour, and the village grew rapidly to service this. The main industry is now tourism although in the town&#x27;s industrial past brick making was once an important industry. Some fishing still takes place on a small scale but most activity is centered on Milford Haven.

Goodwick Sands, the local beach, is where the defeated French invasion force assembled prior to their unconditional surrender on 24 February 1797.

== Fishguard Harbour ==
The harbour was constructed by blasting 1.6 million tonnes of rock from the hillside to make a long breakwater. The quarried-out area became the quay. The harbour was finally opened on 30 August 1906. Planned to be the end of the Great Western Railway&#x27;s line and its major sea port, replacing Neyland, problems with the harbour (known as Fishguard Harbour) prevented larger ocean liners from docking. Accordingly, the harbour has a smaller inner breakwater protecting the remaining open side.

The Great Western Railway ordered three new steamers for its service to Rosslare, St &quot;David&quot;, St &quot;George&quot; and St &quot;Patrick&quot;.

In 1909, when the visited, the passengers had to disembark and board by tender when transferring to and from the London train. The smaller breakwater was built as part of the preparations for the visit of the RMS Mauretania and is sometimes known as the &quot;Mauretania Mole&quot;. The breakwater led to unanticipated silting, and the prospect of future visits from larger liners was abandoned. Directly above the harbour is a small estate known as &quot;Harbour Village&quot;, built to house workers during the construction of the harbour.

The port now accommodates a ferry service to Rosslare operated by Stena Line.

The RNLI, from Fishguard Lifeboat Station operates an all weather Trent class lifeboat, the Blue Peter VII, and a class D inshore lifeboat from within the harbour.

In October 2011, plans for Fishguard &amp; Goodwick Marina were revealed in the Western Telegraph. The developers Conygar who hope to invest £100 million into the project have submitted plans to Pembrokeshire County Council for a 450 berth marina, 253 new residential flats and a 19-acre platform for the potential expansion of the existing Stena Line port. The scheme would also create a publicly accessible promenade and waterfront, and visitor parking as well as workshops, stores and ancillary facilities. If approved most of the proposed new developments will be sited by reclaiming land from the sea bed within the two existing breakwaters mainly near the current &#x27;Ocean Lab&#x27; and alongside the existing ferry terminal access roads. Conygar have also exchanged contracts to acquire an eleven-acre site for a lorry stop and distribution park on the perimeter of the Stena Line owned port. In January 2018, however, Stena announced it had withdrawn from the project, meaning Conygar could not continue with their plans.

== Stop-and-Call ==
Originally a separate settlement, Stop-and-Call has now become contiguous with Goodwick. It is at the point where Goodwick Hill levels out after climbing about from the centre of Goodwick. The 1841 Census for the Parish of Llanwnda indicates the presence of three inhabited houses in &#x27;Stop and Call&#x27;. However, it does not appear on a map which dates from ca. 1850. The will of Margaret Llewelin Lewis of Goodwick, dated 1878, leaves property at &#x27;Stopancall&#x27;. The Ordnance Survey six inch map of Pembrokeshire published 1888 (surveyed 1887) shows the settlement of &#x27;Stop &amp; Call&#x27; comprising only three substantial buildings. A map dating from 1891 shows the area as being moorland, with very few buildings; Kelly&#x27;s Directory for 1895 does not mention the Stop-and-Call

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Goodwick, at community (town) and county level: Fishguard and Goodwick Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council. The town council is based at Fishguard Town Hall in Market Square, Fishguard.

Goodwick historically formed part of the parish of Llanwnda. When parish and district councils were established in 1894, the parish of Llanwnda was included in the Haverfordwest Rural District, as was neighbouring Fishguard. Fishguard was made an urban district in 1907, but Goodwick stayed in Haverfordwest Rural District at that point, despite much of the developing Fishguard Harbour actually falling within Goodwick rather than within the territory of the new Fishguard Urban District. On 1 April 1923 a parish of Goodwick was created from part of Llanwnda, and the new parish was declared to be an urban district, making it independent from the Haverfordwest Rural District Council. Goodwick Urban District was relatively short-lived, being abolished eleven years later when it merged with Fishguard Urban District on 1 April 1934, becoming Fishguard and Goodwick Urban District.
Fishguard and Goodwick Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the district of Preseli Pembrokeshire on 1 April 1974. A community covering the former urban district was established at the same time, with its council taking the name Fishguard and Goodwick Town Council. Preseli Pembrokeshire was abolished in 1996 to become part of a re-established Pembrokeshire.

== Transport ==
Fishguard &amp; Goodwick railway station served local rail travellers from the town, and from nearby Fishguard, until the line was effectively closed to such passengers by the reduction in service to boat trains only in 1964. After this, trains only served Fishguard Harbour and the station fell into disrepair. Following investment from Network Rail and Pembrokeshire County Council the station has now been re-built and was reopened for passengers again, on 14 May 2012. It is served by the boat trains and the newly introduced local trains.

The harbour is used by Stena Line ferries to Rosslare Europort in Ireland. In 2024, the MS Stena Nordica RoPax ferry has two sailings each way per day, one around lunch time and one in the early hours of the morning. The high-speed catamaran ferry Stena Lynx III (renamed Elite Jet in 2023) operated in the summer only until the end of the 2011 season. Her schedule, for instance in the 2010 season consisted of a morning departure to Rosslare and a late afternoon arrival into Fishguard Harbour.

The town is served by the Fishguard town service bus, which runs alternately from Harbour Village or Stop-and-Call to Fishguard Town Hall. Two Fishguard - St Davids bus routes also pass through the town.

=== Early aviation ===
The first successful flight from Britain to Ireland was made from Goodwick&#x27;s Harbour Village on 22 April 1912 by Denys Corbett Wilson, flying a Bleriot XI. The flight lasted one hour 40 minutes, with landfall near Enniscorthy, Ireland. The achievement was commemorated in Centenary Celebrations held in Fishguard and Goodwick on the weekend of 21/22 April 2012 and in a specially commissioned stage play by Derek Webb, called &#x27;100 Minutes&#x27; which was performed in Fishguard and Wexford the same week.

<doc id="242668" wikidata="Q7148361" url="?curid=242668" title="Pattern (architecture)">
<text>Pattern in architecture is the idea of capturing architectural design ideas as archetypal and reusable descriptions. The term &quot;pattern&quot; in this context is usually attributed to Christopher Alexander, an Austrian born American architect. The patterns serve as an aid to design cities and buildings. The concept of having collections of &quot;patterns&quot;, or typical samples as such, is much older. One can think of these collections as forming a pattern language, whereas the elements of this language may be combined, governed by certain rules.

This may be distinct from common use of pattern books, which are collections of architectural plans which may be copied in new works.

== Alexander&#x27;s idea of patterns ==

Alexander&#x27;s patterns seek to provide a source of proven ideas for individuals and communities to use in constructing their living and working environment. As such their aim is both aesthetic and political: to show how beautiful, comfortable and flexible built environments can be constructed, and to enable those people who will inhabit those environments to challenge any solution forced upon them.

A pattern records the design decisions taken by many builders in many places over many years in order to resolve a particular problem. Alexander describes a problem in terms of the so-called &quot;forces&quot; that act in it, and the &quot;solution&quot; is said to resolve those forces. If there are still unresolved forces, then additional patterns may be needed to balance these remaining forces.

== Pattern language ==

Patterns may be collected together into a pattern language that addresses a particular domain. A large body of patterns was published by Alexander and his collaborators as &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;. The patterns in that book were intended to enable communities to construct and modify their own homes, s, towns and cities.

Other than Alexander&#x27;s own projects, few building projects have tried to use Alexander&#x27;s patterns. Those that have done so have met a mixed response from other architects, builders, architectural critics, and users. Alexander has come to believe that patterns themselves are not enough, and that one needs a &quot;morphogenetic&quot; understanding of the formation of the built environment. He has published his ideas in the four-volume work &quot;The Nature of Order&quot;.

While the pattern language idea has so far had limited impact on the building industry, it has had a profound influence on many workers in the information technology industry.

<doc id="242669" wikidata="Q262550" url="?curid=242669" title="Traffic shaping">
<text>Traffic shaping is a bandwidth management technique used on computer networks which delays some or all datagrams to bring them into compliance with a desired &quot;traffic profile&quot;. Traffic shaping is used to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency, or increase usable bandwidth for some kinds of packets by delaying other kinds. It is often confused with traffic policing, the distinct but related practice of packet dropping and packet marking.

The most common type of traffic shaping is application-based traffic shaping. In application-based traffic shaping, fingerprinting tools are first used to identify applications of interest, which are then subject to shaping policies. Some controversial cases of application-based traffic shaping include bandwidth throttling of peer-to-peer file sharing traffic. Many application protocols use encryption to circumvent application-based traffic shaping.

Another type of traffic shaping is route-based traffic shaping. Route-based traffic shaping is conducted based on previous-hop or next-hop information.

==Functionality==
If a link becomes utilized to the point where there is a significant level of congestion, latency can rise substantially. Traffic shaping can be used to prevent this from occurring and keep latency in check. Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of traffic being sent into a network in a specified period (bandwidth throttling), or the maximum rate at which the traffic is sent (rate limiting), or more complex criteria such as generic cell rate algorithm. This control can be accomplished in many ways and for many reasons; however traffic shaping is always achieved by delaying packets.

Traffic shaping is commonly applied at the network edges to control traffic entering the network, but can also be applied by the traffic source (for example, computer or network card) or by an element in the network.

==Uses==
Traffic shaping is sometimes applied by traffic sources to ensure the traffic they send complies with a contract which may be enforced in the network by traffic policing.

Shaping is widely used for teletraffic engineering, and appears in domestic ISPs&#x27; networks as one of several Internet Traffic Management Practices (ITMPs). Some ISPs may use traffic shaping to limit resources consumed by peer-to-peer file-sharing networks, such as BitTorrent.

Data centers use traffic shaping to maintain service level agreements for the variety of applications and the many tenants hosted as they all share the same physical network.

Audio Video Bridging includes an integral traffic-shaping provision defined in IEEE 802.1Qav.

Nodes in an IP network which buffer packets before sending on a link which is at capacity produce an unintended traffic shaping effect. This can appear across, for example, a low bandwidth link, a particularly expensive WAN link or satellite hop.

== Implementation ==
A traffic shaper works by delaying metered traffic such that each packet complies with the relevant traffic contract. Metering may be implemented with, for example, the leaky bucket or token bucket algorithms (the former typically in ATM and the latter in IP networks). Metered packets or cells are then stored in a FIFO buffer, one for each separately shaped class, until they can be transmitted in compliance with the associated traffic contract. Transmission may occur immediately (if the traffic arriving at the shaper is already compliant), after some delay (waiting in the buffer until its scheduled release time) or never (in case of packet loss).

===Overflow condition===
All traffic shaper implementations have a finite buffer, and must cope with the case where the buffer is full. A simple and common approach is to drop traffic arriving while the buffer is full 
a strategy known as tail drop and which results in traffic policing as well as shaping. A more sophisticated implementation could apply a dropping algorithm such as random early detection.

===Traffic classification===
Simple traffic shaping schemes shape all traffic uniformly. More sophisticated shapers first classify traffic. &quot;Traffic classification&quot; categorises traffic (for example, based on port number or protocol). Different &quot;classes&quot; can then be shaped separately to achieve a desired effect.

===Self-limiting sources===
A &quot;self-limiting source&quot; produces traffic which never exceeds some upper bound, for example media sources which cannot transmit faster than their encoded rate allows. Self-limiting sources shape the traffic they generate to a greater or lesser degree. Congestion control mechanisms can also affect traffic shaping of sorts - for example TCP&#x27;s window mechanism implements a variable rate constraint related to bandwidth-delay product.

TCP Nice, a modified version of TCP developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, allows applications to request that certain TCP connections be managed by the operating system as near zero-cost background transfers, or &quot;nice&quot; flows. Such flows interfere only minimally with foreground (non-nice) flows, while reaping a large fraction of spare network bandwidth.

===Relationship to bandwidth management===
Traffic shaping is a specific technique and one of several which combined constitute bandwidth management.

==ISPs and traffic management==
Traffic shaping is of interest especially to internet service providers (ISPs). Their high-cost, high-traffic networks are their major assets, and as such, are the focus of their attentions. They sometimes use traffic shaping to optimize the use of their network, sometimes by shaping traffic according to their assessment of importance and thus discouraging use of certain applications.

==Enterprises==

Most companies with remote offices are now connected via a wide area network (WAN). Applications tend to be centrally hosted at the head office and remote offices are expected to pull data from central databases and server farms. As applications become more hungry in terms of bandwidth and prices of dedicated circuits being relatively high in most areas of the world, instead of increasing the size of their WAN circuits, companies feel the need to properly manage their circuits to make sure business-oriented traffic gets priority over other traffic. Traffic shaping is thus a good means for companies to avoid purchasing additional bandwidth while properly managing these resources.

Alternatives to traffic shaping in this regard are application acceleration and WAN optimization and compression, which are fundamentally different from traffic shaping. Traffic shaping defines bandwidth rules whereas application acceleration using multiple techniques like a TCP performance-enhancing proxy. WAN optimization, on the other hand, compresses data streams or sends only differences in file updates. The latter is quite effective for chatty protocols like CIFS.

==Traffic shaping detection==
There are several methods to detect and measure traffic shaping. Tools have been developed to assist with detection.

<text>A toaster is a small electric appliance that uses radiant heat to brown sliced bread into toast, the color caused from the Maillard reaction. It typically consists of one or more slots into which bread is inserted, and heating elements, often made of nichrome wire, to generate heat and toast the bread to the desired level of crispiness.

== Types ==
=== Pop-up toaster ===
In a pop-up or automatic toaster, a single vertical piece of bread is dropped into a slot on the top of the toaster. A lever on the side of the toaster is pressed down, lowering the bread into the toaster and activating the heating elements. The length of the toasting cycle (and therefore the degree of toasting) is adjustable via a lever, knob, or series of pushbuttons, and when an internal device determines that the toasting cycle is complete, the toaster turns off and the toast pops up out of the slots.

The completion of toasting may be determined by a timer (sometimes manually set) or by a thermal sensor, such as a bimetallic strip, located close to the toast.

Toasters may also be used to toast other foods such as teacakes, toaster pastries, potato waffles and crumpets, though the resultant accumulation of fat and sugar inside the toaster can contribute to its eventual failure.

Among pop-up toasters, those toasting two slices of bread are more purchased than those that can toast four. Pop-up toasters can have a range of appearances beyond just a square box and may have an exterior finish of chrome, copper, brushed metal, or any colored plastic. The marketing and price of toasters may not be an indication of quality for producing good toast. A typical modern two-slice pop-up toaster can draw from 600 to 1200 watts.

Beyond the basic toasting function, some pop-up toasters offer additional features such as:

* One-sided toasting, which some people prefer when toasting bagels
* The ability to power the heat elements in only one of the toaster&#x27;s several slots
* Slots of various depths, lengths, and widths to accommodate a variety of bread types
* Provisions to allow the bread to be lifted higher than the normal raised position, so toast that has shifted during the toasting process can safely and easily be removed

=== Toaster oven ===
Invented in 1910, toaster ovens are small electric ovens that provide toasting capability plus a limited amount of baking and broiling capability. Similarly to a conventional oven, toast or other items are placed on a small wire rack, but toaster ovens can heat foods faster than regular ovens due to their small volume. They are especially useful when the users do not also have a kitchen stove with an integral oven, such as in smaller apartments and recreational vehicles such as truck campers.

=== Conveyor toaster ===
A conveyor toaster is an appliance that caramelizes and carries bread products on a belt or chain into and through a heated chamber. Conveyor toasters are designed to make many slices of toast and are generally used in the catering industry, restaurants, cafeterias, institutional cooking facilities, and other commercial food service situations where constant or high-volume toasting is required. Bread can be toasted at a rate of 250–1800+ slices an hour. The total radiant heat a conveyor toaster applies to each slice can be controlled by adjusting the conveyor speed or the output strength of the heating elements. Conveyor toasters are generally available with either a vertical or horizontal conveyor orientation. Conveyor toasters have been produced for home use; in 1938, for example, the Toast-O-Lator went into limited production.

== History ==
Before the development of the electric toaster, sliced bread was toasted by placing it in a metal frame or on a long-handled toasting fork and holding it near a fire or over a kitchen grill.

From the 16th century onward, long-handled forks were used as toasters, &quot;sometimes with fitment for resting on bars of grate or fender.&quot;

Wrought-iron scroll-ornamented toasters appeared in Scotland in the 17th century. Another wrought-iron toaster was documented to be from 18th-century England.

Utensils for toasting bread over open flames appeared in America in the early 19th century, including decorative implements made from wrought iron.

=== Development of the heating element ===
The primary technical problem in toaster development at the turn of the 20th century was the development of a heating element that would be able to sustain repeated heating to red-hot temperatures without breaking or becoming too brittle. A similar technical challenge had recently been surmounted with the invention of the first successful incandescent lightbulbs by Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison. However, the light bulb took advantage of the presence of a vacuum, something that could not be used for the toaster.

The first stand-alone electric toaster, the Eclipse, was made in 1893 by Crompton &amp; Company of Chelmsford, Essex. Its bare wires toasted bread on one side at a time.

The problem of the heating element was solved in 1905 by a young engineer named Albert Marsh, who designed an alloy of nickel and chromium, which came to be known as nichrome.

The first US patent application for an electric toaster was filed by George Schneider of the American Electrical Heater Company of Detroit in collaboration with Marsh. One of the first applications that the Hoskins company considered for its Chromel wire was for use in toasters, but the company eventually abandoned such efforts, to focus on making just the wire itself.

The first commercially successful electric toaster was introduced by General Electric in 1909 for the GE model D-12.

=== Dual-side toasting and automated pop-up technologies ===

In 1913, Lloyd Groff Copeman and his wife Hazel Berger Copeman applied for various toaster patents, and in that same year, the Copeman Electric Stove Company introduced a toaster with an automatic bread turner. Before this, electric toasters cooked bread on one side, meaning the bread needed to be flipped by hand to cook both sides. Copeman&#x27;s toaster turned the bread around without having to touch it.

The automatic pop-up toaster, which ejects the toast after toasting it, was first patented by Charles Strite in 1921. In 1925, using a redesigned version of Strite&#x27;s toaster, the Waters Genter Company introduced the Model 1-A-1 Toastmaster, the first automatic, pop-up, household toaster that could brown bread on both sides simultaneously, set the heating element on a timer, and eject the toast when finished.

=== Toasting technology after the 1940s ===
In the 1980s, some high-end U.S. toasters featured automatic toast lowering and raising without the need to operate levers – simply dropping the bread into one of these &quot;elevator toasters&quot;, such as the Sunbeam Radiant Control toaster models made from the late 1940s through the 1990s, began the toasting cycle. These toasters use the mechanically multiplied thermal expansion of the resistance wire in the center element assembly to lower the bread; the inserted slice of bread trips a lever switch to activate the heating elements and their thermal expansion is harnessed to lower the bread.

When the toast is done, as determined by a small bimetallic sensor actuated by the heat radiating off the toast, the heaters are shut off and the pull-down mechanism returns to its room-temperature position, slowly raising the finished toast. This sensing of the heat radiating off the toast means that regardless of the type of bread (white or whole grain) or its initial temperature (even frozen), the bread is always toasted to the same consistency.

== Research ==
Several projects have added advanced technology to toasters. In 1990, Simon Hackett and John Romkey created &quot;The Internet Toaster&quot;, a toaster that could be controlled by the Internet. In 2001, Robin Southgate from Brunel University in England created a toaster that could toast a graphic of the weather prediction (limited to sunny or cloudy) onto a piece of bread. The toaster dials a pre-coded phone number to get the weather forecast.

In 2005, Technologic Systems, a vendor of embedded systems hardware, designed a toaster running the NetBSD Unix-like operating system as a sales demonstration system. In 2012, Basheer Tome, a student at Georgia Tech, designed a toaster using color sensors to toast bread to the exact shade of brown specified by a user.

A toaster that used Twitter was cited as an early example of an application of the Internet of Things. Toasters have been used as advertising devices for online marketing.

With permanent modifications, a toaster oven can be used as a reflow oven to solder electronic components to circuit boards.

== Similar inventions ==
=== Hot dog toaster ===
A hot dog toaster is a variation on the toaster design; it can cook hot dogs without the use of microwaves or stoves. The appliance looks similar to a regular toaster, except that there are two slots in the middle for hot dogs and two slots on the outside for toasting the buns. Or there can be a set of skewers upon which hot dog are impaled.

<doc id="242674" wikidata="Q1431247" url="?curid=242674" title="Hall effect sensor">
<text>A Hall effect sensor (also known as a Hall sensor or Hall probe) is any sensor incorporating one or more Hall elements, each of which produces a voltage proportional to one axial component of the magnetic field vector using the Hall effect (named for physicist Edwin Hall).

Hall sensors are used for proximity sensing, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications and are common in industrial and consumer applications. Hundreds of millions of Hall sensor integrated circuits (ICs) are sold each year by about 50 manufacturers, with the global market around a billion dollars.

== Principles ==

In a Hall sensor, a fixed DC bias current is applied along one axis across a thin strip of metal called the Hall element transducer. Sensing electrodes on opposite sides of the Hall element along &quot;another&quot; axis measure the difference in electric potential (voltage) across the axis of the electrodes. The current&#x27;s charge carriers are deflected by the Lorentz force in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to their flow. The sensing electrodes measure the potential difference (the Hall voltage) proportional to the axial component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to &quot;both&quot; the current&#x27;s axis and the sensing electrodes&#x27; axis.

Hall effect sensors respond both to static magnetic fields and to changing ones. (Inductive sensors, in contrast, only respond to changes in fields.)

=== Amplification ===
Hall effect devices produce a very low signal level and thus require amplification. The vacuum tube amplifier technology available in the first half of the 20th century was too large, expensive, and power-consuming for everyday Hall effect sensor applications, which were limited to laboratory instruments. Even early generation transistor technology was unsuited; it was only with the development of the low-cost silicon chip-based integrated circuit (IC) micro-technology that the Hall effect sensor became suitable for mass application. Devices sold as Hall sensors nowadays contain both the sensor as described above and a high gain IC amplifier in a single package. These Hall sensor ICs may add a stable voltage regulator in addition to the amplifier to allow operation over a wide range of supply voltage and boost the Hall voltage for a convenient analog signal output proportional to the magnetic field component. In some cases, the linear circuit may cancel the offset voltage of Hall sensors. Moreover, AC modulation of the driving current may also reduce the influence of this offset voltage.

Hall sensors are called &quot;linear&quot; if their output is proportional to the incident magnetic field strength. This output signal can be an analog voltage, a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal, or be communicated digitally over a modern bus protocol. Hall sensors may also be &quot;ratiometric&quot; if their sensitivity is also proportional to their supply voltage. With no magnetic field applied, their &quot;quiescent output voltage&quot; is typically half of the supply voltage. They may have rail-to-rail output (e.g., A1302).

=== Hall switch ===
While the Hall element is an analog device, &quot;Hall switch&quot; ICs often additionally incorporate threshold detection circuitry to form an electronic switch which has two states (on and off) that output a binary digital signal.

Their outputs may be open collector NPN transistors (or open drain n-type MOSFETs) for compatibility with ICs that use different supply voltages. Rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall sensor signal output wire, an output transistor is turned on, providing a circuit to ground through the signal output wire.

==== Hysteresis ====
Schmitt trigger filtering may be applied (or integrated into the IC) to provide a clean digital output that is robust against sensor noise. The hysteresis thresholds for switching (specified as B and B) categorize digital Hall ICs as either unipolar switches, omnipolar switches, or bipolar switches, which may sometimes be called latches. Unipolar (e.g., A3144) refers to having switching thresholds in only one polarity of the magnetic field. Omnipolar switches have two sets of switching thresholds, for both positive and negative polarities, and so operate alternatively with a strong positive or a strong negative magnetic field.

Bipolar switches have a positive B and a negative B (and thus require both positive and negative magnetic fields to operate). The difference between B and B tends to be greater for bipolar switches described as latches, which remain in one state much longer (i.e. they latch onto their last value) and require a greater field strength to change states than bipolar switches require. The naming distinction between &quot;bipolar&quot; and &quot;latch&quot; may be a little arbitrary, for instance, the datasheet for the Honeywell SS41F describes it as &quot;bipolar&quot;, while another manufacturer describes their SS41F with comparable specifications as a &quot;latch&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

=== Directionality ===
Hall elements measure only the sensing axis component of the magnetic field vector. Because that axial component may be positive or negative, some Hall sensors can sense the binary direction of the axial component in addition to its magnitude. An additional perpendicularly-oriented Hall element (e.g. in ) must be incorporated to determine a 2-D direction, and another perpendicularly-oriented Hall element must be added to detect the full 3-D components of the magnetic field vector.

=== Solid state ===
Because Hall sensor ICs are solid-state devices, they are not prone to mechanical wear. Thus, they can operate at much higher speeds than mechanical sensors, and their lifespan is not limited by mechanical failure (unlike potentiometers, electromechanical reed switches, relays, or other mechanical switches and sensors). However, Hall sensors can be prone to thermal drift due to changes in environmental conditions and to time drift over the lifetime of the sensor.

Hall effect devices (when appropriately packaged) are immune to dust, dirt, mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical sensing.

=== Bandwidth ===
The bandwidth of practical Hall sensors is limited to the hundreds of kilohertz, with commercial silicon ones commonly limited to 10–100 kHz. , the fastest Hall sensor available in the market has a bandwidth of 1 MHz but uses non-standard semiconductors.

=== Susceptibility to external fields ===
Magnetic flux from the surroundings (such as other wires) may diminish or enhance the field the Hall probe intends to detect, rendering the results inaccurate. Hall sensors can detect stray magnetic fields easily, including that of Earth, so they work well as electronic compasses: but this also means that such stray fields can hinder accurate measurements of small magnetic fields. To solve this problem, Hall sensors are often integrated with magnetic shielding of some kind.

Mechanical positions within an electromagnetic system can instead be measured without the Hall effect using optical position encoders (e.g., absolute and incremental encoders) and induced voltage by moving the amount of metalcore inserted into a transformer. When Hall is compared to photo-sensitive methods, it is harder to get an absolute position with Hall.

==== Differential Hall sensors ====
While a single Hall element is susceptible to external magnetic fields, a differential configuration of two Hall elements can cancel stray fields out from measurements, analogous to how common mode voltage signals are canceled using differential signaling.

== Materials ==

The following materials are especially suitable for Hall effect sensors:

* Gallium arsenide (GaAs)
* Indium arsenide (InAs)
* Indium phosphide (InP)
* Indium antimonide (InSb)
* Graphene

== Applications ==

Hall effect sensors may be used in various sensors such as rotating speed sensors (bicycle wheels, gear-teeth, automotive speedometers, electronic ignition systems), fluid flow sensors, current sensors, and pressure sensors. Hall sensors are commonly used to time the speed of wheels and shafts (e.g. Figure 1), such as for internal combustion engine ignition timing, tachometers and anti-lock braking systems.

Common applications are often found where a robust and contactless alternative to a mechanical switch or potentiometer is required. These include: electric airsoft guns, triggers of electropneumatic paintball guns, go-kart speed controls, smartphones, and some global positioning systems.

=== Position sensing ===
One of the most common industrial applications of Hall sensors used as binary switches is in position sensing (e.g. Figure 2).

Hall effect sensors are used to detect whether a smartphone&#x27;s cover (that includes a small magnet) is closed.

Some computer printers use Hall sensors to detect missing paper and open covers and some 3D printers use them to measure filament thickness.

Hall sensors are used in some automotive fuel-level indicators by detecting the position of a floating element in the fuel tank.

Hall sensors affixed to mechanical gauges that have magnetized indicator needles can translate the physical position or orientation of the mechanical indicator needle into an electrical signal that can be used by electronic indicators, controls or communications devices.

=== Magnetometers ===
Hall effect magnetometers (also called tesla meters or gauss meters) use a &quot;Hall probe&quot; with a Hall element to measure magnetic fields or inspect materials (such as tubing or pipelines) using the principles of magnetic flux leakage. A Hall probe is a device that uses a calibrated Hall effect sensor to directly measure the strength of a magnetic field. Since magnetic fields have a direction as well as a magnitude, the results from a Hall probe are dependent on the orientation, as well as the position, of the probe.

=== Ammeters ===
Hall sensors may be utilized for contactless measurements of direct current in current transformers. In such a case the Hall sensor is mounted in a gap in the magnetic core around the current conductor. As a result, the DC magnetic flux can be measured, and the DC in the conductor can be calculated.

When electrons flow through a conductor, a magnetic field is produced. Thus, it is possible to create a non-contacting current sensor or ammeters. The device has three terminals. A sensor voltage is applied across two terminals and the third provides a voltage proportional to the current being sensed. This has several advantages; no additional resistance (a &quot;shunt&quot;, required for the most common current sensing method) needs to be inserted in the primary circuit. Also, the voltage present on the line to be sensed is not transmitted to the sensor, which enhances the safety of measuring equipment.
==== Improving signal-to-noise ====
Integrating a Hall sensor into a ferrite ring (as shown) concentrates the flux density of the current&#x27;s magnetic field along the ferrite ring and through the sensor (because flux flows through ferrite much better than through air), which greatly reduces the relative influence of stray fields by a factor of 100 or better. This configuration also provides an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and drift effects of over 20 times that of a bare Hall device.

The range of a given feedthrough sensor may also be extended upward and downward by appropriate wiring. To extend the range to lower currents, multiple turns of the current-carrying wire may be made through the opening, each turn adding to the sensor output the same quantity; when the sensor is installed onto a printed circuit board, the turns can be carried out by a staple on the board. To extend the range to higher currents, a current divider may be used. The divider splits the current across two wires of differing widths and the thinner wire, carrying a smaller proportion of the total current, passes through the sensor.

==== Current clamp ====

A variation on the ring sensor uses a split sensor which is clamped onto the line enabling the device to be used in temporary test equipment. If used in a permanent installation, a split sensor allows the electric current to be tested without dismantling the existing circuit.

The output is proportional to both the applied magnetic field and the applied sensor voltage. If the magnetic field is applied by a solenoid, the sensor output is proportional to the product of the current through the solenoid and the sensor voltage. As most applications requiring computation are now performed by small digital computers, the remaining useful application is in power sensing, which combines current sensing with voltage sensing in a single Hall effect device.

By sensing the current provided to a load and using the device&#x27;s applied voltage as a sensor voltage it is possible to determine the power dissipated by a device to form a wattmeter.

=== Motion sensing ===
Hall effect devices used in motion sensing and motion limit switches can offer enhanced reliability in extreme environments. As there are no moving parts involved within the sensor or magnet, typical life expectancy is improved compared to traditional electromechanical switches. Additionally, the sensor and magnet may be encapsulated in an appropriate protective material.

==== Ignition timing ====
Commonly used in distributors for ignition timing (and in some types of crank- and camshaft-position sensors for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall Effect sensor is used as a direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows: a stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall Effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall Effect sensor.

A metal rotor consisting of windows or tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows or tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet&#x27;s field respective of whether a tab or window is passing through the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have several equal-sized windows or tabs matching the number of engine cylinders (the #1 cylinder tab will always be unique for discernment by the Engine Control Unit).

This produces a uniform output similar to a square wave since the shielding and exposure time are equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing.

==== Anti-lock braking ====
The sensing of wheel rotation is especially useful in anti-lock braking systems. The principles of such systems have been extended and refined to offer more than anti-skid functions, now providing extended vehicle handling enhancements.

==== Brushless motors ====
Some types of brushless DC electric motors use Hall effect sensors to detect the position of the rotor and feed that information to the motor controller. This allows for more precise motor control. Hall sensors in 3 or 4-pin brushless DC motors sense the position of the rotor and to switch the transistors in the right sequence.

=== Hall-effect thruster ===

A Hall-effect thruster (HET) is a device that is used to propel some spacecraft, after it gets into orbit or farther out into space. In the HET, atoms are ionized and accelerated by an electric field. A radial magnetic field established by magnets on the thruster is used to trap electrons which then orbit and create an electric field due to the Hall effect. A large potential is established between the end of the thruster where neutral propellant is fed, and the part where electrons are produced; so, electrons trapped in the magnetic field cannot drop to the lower potential. They are thus extremely energetic, which means that they can ionize neutral atoms. Neutral propellant is pumped into the chamber and is ionized by the trapped electrons. Positive ions and electrons are then ejected from the thruster as a quasineutral plasma, creating thrust. The thrust produced is extremely small, with a very low mass flow rate and a very high effective exhaust velocity/specific impulse. This is achieved at the cost of very high electrical power requirements, on the order of 4 kW for a few hundred millinewtons of thrust.

=== Integrated digital electronics ===
Hall sensors ICs often integrate digital electronics. This enables advanced corrections to the sensor characteristics (e.g. temperature-coefficient corrections), digital communication to microprocessor systems, and may provide interfaces for input diagnostics, fault protection for transient conditions, and short/open-circuit detection.

Some Hall sensor ICs include DSP, which can allow more processing techniques directly within the sensor package.

Some Hall sensor ICs integrate an analog-to-digital converter and I2C (Inter-integrated circuit communication protocol) IC for direct connection to a microcontroller&#x27;s I/O port.

The ESP32 microcontroller even has an integrated Hall sensor which hypothetically could be read by the microcontroller&#x27;s internal analog-to-digital converter, though it does not work.

=== Two-wire interface ===
Hall sensors normally require at least three pins (for power, ground, and output). However, two-wire ICs only use a power and ground pin, and instead communicate data using different current levels. Multiple two-wire ICs may operate from a single supply line, to further reduce wiring.

=== Human interface devices ===
Hall effect switches for computer keyboards were developed in the late 1960s by Everett A. Vorthmann and Joseph T. Maupin at Honeywell. Due to high manufacturing costs these keyboards were often reserved for high-reliability applications such as aerospace and military. As mass-production costs have declined, an increasing number of consumer models have become available.

Hall effect sensors can also be found on some high-performance gaming keyboards (made by companies such as SteelSeries, Wooting, Corsair), with the switches themselves containing magnets.

Although Sega pioneered the use of Hall effect sensors in their Sega Saturn 3D controller and Dreamcast stock controller from the 1990s, Hall effect sensors have only started gaining popularity for use in consumer game controllers since the early 2020s, most notably in analog stick/joystick and trigger mechanisms, for enhanced experience due to their contactless, high-resolution, low-latency measurements of position and movement and their longer lifespan due to lack of mechanical parts.

Applications for Hall effect sensing have also expanded to industrial applications, which now use Hall effect joysticks to control hydraulic valves, replacing the traditional mechanical levers with contactless sensing. Such applications include mining trucks, backhoe loaders, cranes, diggers, scissor lifts, etc.

=== Dual Hall sensor ICs ===
Some ICs include two Hall elements. This is useful for counting a series of increments (an incremental encoder) to make a linear or rotary encoder, whereby a moving or rotating arrangement of magnets produces an alternating magnetic pattern sensed as a quadrature encoded pattern. That pattern can then be decoded to provide both the speed and direction of movement or simply counted up and down to determine the position or angle. (When only one Hall element is used, the direction of linear or rotary encoders cannot be determined). The two elements placed at a precise distance apart from each other on the die may either be oriented in the same direction, in which case the magnetic pole-to-pole pitch should ideally be two times the Hall element-to-element pitch. Alternatively, the Hall elements may be oriented at 90 degrees to provide sensing in two axes.

<doc id="242679" wikidata="Q2600811" url="?curid=242679" title="York, Upper Canada">
<text>York was a town and the second capital of the colony of Upper Canada. It is the predecessor to the old city of Toronto (1834–1998). It was established in 1793 by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe as a &quot;temporary&quot; location for the capital of Upper Canada, while he made plans to build a capital near today&#x27;s London, Ontario. Simcoe renamed the location York after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, George III&#x27;s second son. Simcoe gave up his plan to build a capital at London, and York became the permanent capital of Upper Canada on February 1, 1796. That year Simcoe returned to Britain and was temporarily replaced by Peter Russell.

The original townsite was a compact ten blocks near the mouth of the Don River and a garrison was built at the channel to Toronto Harbour. Government buildings and a law court were established. Yonge Street was built, connecting York to the Holland River to the north. To the east, Kingston Road was built to the mouth of the Trent River. In 1797, the town site was expanded to the west to allow for public buildings and expansion. One of the new area&#x27;s public functions, a public market, was started in 1803. It continues today as St. Lawrence Market.

The settlement was attacked by American troops during the War of 1812. As the British garrison retreated, they detonated their powder magazine, inflicting numerous casualties on the invading U.S. forces, who proceeded to loot and destroy the town. The victorious Americans chose not to occupy the town and the British eventually returned without conflict. A reprisal attack was made on the American capital of Washington, D.C. a year later. After the war was over, the town continued to grow, expanding to the west, leaving the original town site, a less desirable location, somewhat undeveloped. A new parliament building was erected, near the original location, but this burned down and a new building was built in the new lands to the west. 

A permanent fort, Fort York, was built on the site of the garrison. Dundas Street was built to connect York to towns to the west. In the 1820s, the town experienced a surge of immigrants, expanding from 1,000 residents to over 9,000 by the time the town was incorporated as the City of Toronto in 1834. During its existence, the town did not have its own government; it was governed by the province of Upper Canada, with a mix of elected officials and an aristocracy known as the Family Compact controlling the government. By 1830, this led to an ongoing political conflict, which would later lead to the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion.
==History==
When Europeans first arrived at the site of York, the vicinity was inhabited by the Iroquoian Seneca tribe (from the Five Nations Iroquois of New York State), who by then had displaced the Wyandot (Huron) tribes that had occupied the region for centuries before . By 1701, the Iroquoian villages that had been established along the north shore of Lake Ontario during the sixteenth century had been abandoned. The Algonkian Mississaugas then moved into the York region, created alliances with the former Iroquoian residents, and established their own settlements; one near the former Seneca village of Teiaiagon on the Humber River.

The name &quot;Toronto&quot; is derived from indigenous sources. A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through this point, the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, led to widespread use of the name. The word &quot;toronto&quot;, meaning &quot;plenty&quot; appears in a French lexicon of the Huron language in 1632, and it appeared on French maps referring to various locations, including Georgian Bay, Lake Simcoe, and several rivers. In Mohawk, the word &quot;tkaronto&quot;, meant &quot;place where trees stand in the water&quot;. It refers to the northern end of what is now Lake Simcoe, where the Huron and preceding inhabitants had planted tree saplings to corral fish.

The shoreline was likely sandy and parts sloping down to Lake Ontario (see Geography of Toronto). The original shoreline followed what is now Front Street. Everything now south of Front Street is the result of land fill. The Toronto Islands were still connected to the mainland. It was wooded, with marshes in what is now Ashbridge&#x27;s Bay and the then natural mouth of the Don (Keating Channel did not exist yet). Other than Lake Ontario, other waterways into old town included the Don and several other small creeks, such as Garrison Creek, Russell Creek and Taddle Creek.

Between 1710 and 1750, French traders established two trading posts on the Humber River, Magasin Royale, and Fort Toronto. The success of Fort Toronto led the French to build Fort Rouillé on the current Exhibition grounds in 1750. It only lasted until 1759, abandoned after the fall of Fort Niagara, when the French retreated to Montreal. The British arrived the next year with an army to secure the location. The British claimed all of New France after the 1763 Treaty of Paris, and extended the Province of Quebec to present-day Ontario.

After the American Revolutionary War, the region saw an influx of British settlers as United Empire Loyalists arrived in numbers north of Lake Ontario, as the British offered free land to many. As plans were being made to create the new province of Upper Canada, British North America Governor-General Lord Dorchester selected the area north of Toronto Bay for a new capital. Dorchester arranged for the Toronto Purchase with the Mississaugas of New Credit, thereby securing more than a of land. The purchase was disputed in 1788, and a further agreement was made in 1805, but a final settlement of the purchase would only come 200 years later in 2010, for a total of .

In 1791, Upper Canada was established, with Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake) its first capital. The first Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe arrived in 1792 and first visited the Toronto Purchase site in May 1793. Impressed by the site and harbour, he moved the capital to Toronto, on a &quot;temporary&quot; basis, while he worked on plans to build a capital in the vicinity of London, Ontario. Simcoe renamed the townsite York, rejecting the aboriginal name. The name of York was chosen to please King George, as a compliment to the Duke of York, his son. Simcoe founded York on August 27, 1793.

Simcoe and his family took residence in July 1793. They found the location to be an isolated wilderness, with dense forest right to the shore. A few families of Mississaugas were the only residents and &quot;immense coveys of fowl.&quot; They lived in a tent that once belonged to Captain James Cook the explorer, at the foot of today&#x27;s Bathurst Street. It would be the temporary capital until 1796, when Simcoe abandoned his plans to make London the capital. The first parliament in the new capital convened in June 1797, after Simcoe had returned to England and Peter Russell was named administrator of Upper Canada.

The townsite was first surveyed in 1788, but Simcoe developed a new town plan. The Town of York was laid out in ten original blocks between today&#x27;s Adelaide and Front streets (the latter following the shoreline) with the first church (St James Anglican), Town Hall and Wharf (named St Lawrence after the river) on the west and the first parliament buildings, blockhouse and windmill on the east. Taddle Creek lay on the eastern boundary, the Don River and its wetland further to the east. Two main roads were laid out: Lot Street (today&#x27;s Queen Street) and Yonge Street, which was built as far north as the Holland River. In 1797, a garrison was built east of modern-day Bathurst Street, on the east bank of Garrison Creek.

In August 1796, Charles McCuen, a soldier in the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, murdered Wabakinine, a Mississauga chief and one of the signers of the Toronto Purchase, on the waterfront. The murder of Wabakinine and his wife threatened to derail the peace between the British and the Mississaugas. The Mississaugas, already frustrated by the failed promises of the Toronto Purchase, considered a counterattack, either on the capital itself or on nearby pioneer farms. The York authorities brought McCuen to trial for murder but he was ultimately acquitted due to lack of evidence. An uprising was averted through the efforts of Joseph Brant, a First Nations interpreter, guide and diplomat.

All land south of Lot Street was reserved for expansion of the Town or Fort by the government as &#x27;the Commons&#x27;. North of Lot Street was the &quot;Liberties&quot;, the eventual rural Township of York. It was divided into large &#x27;park lots&#x27; where the city&#x27;s moneyed elite built their estates, such as &#x27;the Grange&#x27; and &#x27;Moss park.&#x27; With time, some of these estate lots were subdivided, like the Macaulay family estate between Yonge St and Osgoode Hall (now Toronto City Hall), which became a working-class neighbourhood known as Macaulaytown. The original townsite area is today known as the &quot;Old Town&quot;.

On June 1, 1807, on the south east corner of King and George, a priest named Dr. G. Okill Stuart opened the Home District School, the first public school in York. The school taught both boys and girls and ran out of a little stone structure beside his home. Dr. Stuart&#x27;s lectures were &quot;curious, marked as it was with by unexpected elevations, and depressions of the voice and long closings of the eyes&quot;. In that same year, the first brick house in York was constructed, the home and store of Quetton St. George at King and Frederick. St. George imported the bricks from New York state.

The Battle of York was fought on April 27, 1813. An American force supported by a squadron consisting of a ship-rigged corvette, a brig and twelve schooners landed on the lake shore to the west of the garrison, defeating the British and capturing the fort, town and dockyard. The Americans suffered heavy casualties, including Brigadier General Zebulon Pike who was leading the troops when the retreating British blew up the fort&#x27;s magazine. The American forces carried out several acts of arson and looting in the town before withdrawing. Although the Americans won a clear victory, it did not have decisive strategic results as York was a less important objective in military terms than Kingston, where the British armed vessels on Lake Ontario were based.

The Town of York did not fill the small original blocks, instead development spread to the west; the area west to Peter Street had been annexed in 1797 on the order of the province. The town grid was extended west and plots of land near New (Jarvis) and Church streets were set aside for public buildings. St. Lawrence Market, St. James&#x27; Cathedral and the Courthouse and Jail on King would be built on the public reserves. The Town was also extended in the east along King Street (then a part of Kingston Road) to the Don River. There, Angell&#x27;s Bridge stretched across the Don. A path led from Angell&#x27;s Bridge south to the peninsula and the lighthouse.

The chief business part of the town was King and Front streets, the western limit being Yonge street, and the eastern limit the Don bridge. There were, however, many private residences west of York on Yonge, Front and Lot Streets, and as far west as the garrison. In comparison, the original town site itself was not fully developed by the time of incorporation. The Parliament buildings, destroyed in 1813 by war and later by fire, were moved to the west, helping to draw persons to the west. The town became fully developed as far west as York Street, with some built-up areas west to Peter. North of Lot Street, Spadina Avenue was already laid out to the north, and the two north–south roadways that would become University Avenue. of land had been purchased in 1825 to be the campus of King&#x27;s College, today&#x27;s University of Toronto, at the north end of the roads.

Rougher conditions existed in several area. &quot;Macaulaytown&quot;, (named after the Queen&#x27;s Ranger who had been given the park lot) basically a shanty town, and the site of many poor immigrants, was north of Lot and west of Yonge. Squatters lived a meager existence along the Don River and the lakefront. Conditions were poor on both sides of Church Street in back lanes. The worst was reputed to be Henrietta Lane, off King, west of Church, south to Market (Wellington today), which in 1832 was a center of a cholera epidemic. Pearson recalls the muddy and filthy lane as being the site of a few shanties inhabited by widows, who kept cows. The cows would be led to the garrison common each day to graze. Two stables were also nearby, making the neighbourhood &quot;odiferous&quot; in his opinion. The area around Henrietta would eventually be cleared of the slum, its north end on King closed off first, and the area redeveloped around the new Colborne Street. March Street (Lombard today) was also noted as being rough and having a red-light district.

As the town grew, fire prevention became more important. Starting in 1820, homes were required to have two leather buckets on the front of their houses. If a fire alarm was raised, a line of citizens from the bay to the burning building passed the buckets. In 1826, the first fire company was inaugurated and a fire hall was built on Church Street. Soldiers at nearby Fort York also assisted in fire fighting when needed.

There was no official police force. Able-bodied male citizens were required to report for night duty as special constables for a fixed number of nights a year under the penalty of fine or imprisonment in a system known as &quot;watch and ward&quot;. The first police office was opened in 1826, only open from 11 a.m to 2 p.m daily except Sunday, Christmas Day and Good Friday. The number of constables was eleven in 1810, twenty in 1820 and twelve in 1830.

There was a major cholera epidemic in Upper Canada from 1832 to 1834. There were two outbreaks in York, in 1832 and 1834. About 1,000 persons died in the two outbreaks. The disease, poorly understood at the time and caused by contaminated food or water, was acutely infectious. The number of patients overwhelmed the hospital and special sheds had to be built adjacent to house the patients.

==Government and politics==
Upper Canada was established with a bicameral legislature. The upper chamber, the Executive Council of Upper Canada was appointed by, and served the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. The lower chamber or Legislative Assembly, was elected from the various districts. York was situated in Home District and Home District Council was responsible for municipal matters for York.

=== Family Compact ===

The Family Compact was a small closed group of men who exercised most of the political, economic and judicial power in Upper Canada from the 1810s to the 1840s. Several were members of the Executive Council. It was noted for its conservatism and opposition to democracy.

Upper Canada did not have a hereditary nobility. In its place, senior members of Upper Canada bureaucracy, the Executive Council of Upper Canada and Legislative Council of Upper Canada, made up the elite of the Compact. These men sought to solidify their personal positions into family dynasties and acquire all the marks of gentility. They used their government positions to extend their business and speculative interests.

The centre of the Compact was York. Its most important member was the Rev. John Strachan; many of the other members were his former students, or people who were related to him. Another prominent member of the Compact was Sir John Beverley Robinson who was the Chief Justice of Upper Canada for 34 years from 1829. The rest of the members were mostly descendants of United Empire Loyalists or recent upper-class British settlers such as the Boulton family, builders of the Grange.

=== Reform opposition ===

Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when those suffering the abuses of the Family Compact began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act 1832 that eliminated much of the political corruption in the English Parliamentary system. Prominent politicians in reform city politics included James Lesslie, a bookseller and founder of the Mechanics Institute, Bank of the People and House of Refuge &amp; Industry; Jesse Ketchum, the Member of the Legislative Assembly for the city; Dr Thomas David Morrison, founder of the Upper Canada Political Union, and mayor of the city in 1836; and William O&#x27;Grady, publisher of the reform newspaper, &quot;The Correspondent.&quot;

=== Political conflict ===

==== Types riot, 1826 ====
In 1826, in the &quot;Types Riot&quot;, the printing press of William Lyon Mackenzie was destroyed by the young lawyers of the Juvenile Advocate&#x27;s Society with the complicity of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General and the magistrates of Toronto.

Mackenzie had published a series of satires under the pseudonym of &quot;Patrick Swift, nephew of Jonathan Swift&quot; in an attempt to humiliate the members of the Family Compact running for the board of the Bank of Upper Canada, and Henry John Boulton the Solicitor General, in particular. Mackenzie&#x27;s articles worked, and they lost control. In revenge they sacked Mackenzie&#x27;s press, throwing the type into the lake. The &#x27;juvenile advocates&#x27; were the students of the Attorney General and the Solicitor General, and the act was performed in broad daylight in front of William Allan, bank president and magistrate. They were never charged, and it was left to Mackenzie to launch a civil lawsuit instead.

There are three implications of the Types riot according to historian Paul Romney. First, he argues the riot illustrates how the elite&#x27;s self-justifications regularly skirted the rule of law they held out as their Loyalist mission. Second, he demonstrated that the significant damages Mackenzie received in his civil lawsuit against the vandals did not reflect the soundness of the criminal administration of justice in Upper Canada. And lastly, he sees in the Types riot &quot;the seed of the Rebellion&quot; in a deeper sense than those earlier writers who viewed it simply as the start of a highly personal feud between Mackenzie and the Family Compact. Romney emphasizes that Mackenzie&#x27;s personal harassment, the &quot;outrage&quot;, served as a lightning rod of discontent because so many Upper Canadians had faced similar endemic abuses and hence identified their political fortunes with his.

==== Election riot, 1832 ====
Buoyed by large public displays of support following his re-election in January 1832, Mackenzie called for a public meeting in York on March 23, in the face of an increasingly well organized opposition, and threats of violence. Both supporters and opponents of Mackenzie gathered in front of the Court House at noon, when Sheriff William Botsford Jarvis granted the chair of the meeting to Dr. Dunlop, of the Canada Company, rather than Reform MPP Jesse Ketchum, the reformers&#x27; choice, despite a reform majority. The tories then made short order of the meeting, passing a resolution in favour of the colonial administration, and adjourning.

Mackenzie&#x27;s supporters had, in the meanwhile, reassembled to the west in front of the jail, where they set about passing their own resolutions. Ketchum, Mackenzie, Morrison and others stood in a wagon to address the crowd, when twenty members of the Orange Order grabbed the wagon sending them flying. In an attempt to defuse the growing tension, Sheriff Jarvis assembled the government supporters into a parade of 1,200, which marched off to government house in the west end to cheer Lieut. Governor Colborne, before returning to the Market Square. As they re-passed the Court House, they were joined by a group carrying an effigy of Mackenzie, who made their way to the Advocate office on Church St., which they began to pelt with stones. After burning the effigy of Mackenzie, a general skirmish ensued when the terrified printers fired a warning shot over the mob&#x27;s heads. A riot ensued that lasted the night.

==== Grand Convention of Delegates, 1834 ====
Mackenzie returned to Toronto from his London journey in the last week of August 1833, to find his appeals to the British Parliament had been ultimately ineffective. At an emergency meeting of Reformers, David Willson, leader of the Children of Peace, proposed extending the nomination process for members of the House of Assembly they had begun in their village of Hope north of Toronto to all four Ridings of York (now York Region), and to establish a &quot;General Convention of Delegates&quot; from each riding in which to establish a common political platform. This convention could then become the core of a &quot;permanent convention&quot; or political party - an innovation not yet seen in Upper Canada. The organization of this convention was a model for the &quot;Constitutional Convention&quot; Mackenzie organized for the Rebellion of 1837, where many of the same delegates were to attend.

The convention was held in the old Court House on February 27, 1834, with delegates from all four of the York ridings. The week before, Mackenzie published Willson&#x27;s call for a &quot;standing convention&quot; (political party). The day of the convention, the Children of Peace led a &quot;Grand Procession&quot; with their choir and band (the first civilian band in the province) to the Old Court House. David Willson was the main speaker before the convention and &quot;he addressed the meeting with great force and effect&quot;. The convention nominated four Reform candidates, all of whom were ultimately successful in the election. The convention stopped short, however, of establishing a political party. Instead, they formed yet another Political Union.

==== Incorporation as City of Toronto, 1834====

In 1833, several prominent reformers had petitioned the House to have the town incorporated, which would also have made the position of magistrate elective. The Tory-controlled House of Assembly struggled to find a means of creating a legitimate electoral system that might, nonetheless, minimize the chances of reformers being elected. The bill passed on March 6, 1834, and proposed two different property qualifications for voting. There was a higher qualification for the election of aldermen (who would also serve as magistrates), and a lower one for common councillors. Two aldermen and two councilmen would be elected from each city ward. This relatively broad electorate was offset by a much higher qualification for election to office, which essentially limited election to the wealthy much like the old Court of Quarter Sessions it replaced. The mayor was elected by the aldermen from among their number, and a clear barrier was erected between those of property who served as full magistrates, and the rest. Only 230 of the city&#x27;s 2,929 adult men met this stringent property qualification. However, the Family Compact - and their member for Parliament Sheriff William B. Jarvis in particular - alienated a large part of the city&#x27;s construction tradesmen in late 1833. Left without pay, they held Toronto&#x27;s first strike. Jarvis had them arrested, and obstructed legislation that would protect their pay. As a result, there was a major landslide in the first city elections. The first mayor of the new City of Toronto was William Lyon Mackenzie.

== Population ==

York&#x27;s population was primarily from the British Isles (from Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland) with a few other European settlers (French, German and Dutch). York being a garrison town meant there were one or more regiments of Imperial troops stationed there. The officers were considered an acquisition to society, and, &quot;many of the fair daughters of York formed marriages with these gallant fellows.&quot;

The town saw a wave of English immigrants in the later 1820s. In 1826, the population was 1,700, in 1830, 2,860 and in 1834, 9,254.

<doc id="242681" wikidata="Q6703824" url="?curid=242681" title="Lunar precession">
<text>Lunar precession is a term used for three different precession motions related to the Moon. First, it can refer to change in orientation of the lunar rotational axis with respect to a reference plane, following the normal rules of precession followed by spinning objects.
In addition, the orbit of the Moon undergoes two important types of precessional motion: apsidal and nodal.

==Axial precession==
The rotational axis of the Moon also undergoes precession. Since the Moon&#x27;s axial tilt is only 1.5° with respect to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun), this effect is small. Once every 18.6 years, the lunar north pole describes a small circle around a point in the constellation Draco, while correspondingly, the lunar south pole describes a small circle around a point in the constellation Dorado. Similar to Earth, the Moon&#x27;s axial precession is westwards - whereas Apsidal precession is in the same direction as the rotation (meaning apsidal precession is eastward).

== Apsidal precession ==

This kind of precession is that of the major axis of the Moon&#x27;s elliptic orbit (the line of the apsides from perigee to apogee), which precesses eastward by 360° in approximately 8.85 years. This is the reason that an anomalistic month (the period the Moon moves from the perigee to the apogee and to the perigee again) is longer than the sidereal month (the period the Moon takes to complete one orbit with respect to the fixed stars). This apsidal precession completes one rotation in the same time as the number of sidereal months exceeds the number of anomalistic months by exactly one, after about 3,233 days (8.85 years).

==Nodal precession==


Another type of lunar orbit precession is that of the plane of the Moon&#x27;s orbit. The period of the lunar nodal precession is defined as the time it takes the ascending node to move through 360° relative to the vernal equinox (autumnal equinox in the Southern Hemisphere). It is about 18.6 years and the direction of motion is westward, i.e., in the direction opposite to the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. This is the reason that a draconic month or nodal period (the period the Moon takes to return to the same node in its orbit) is shorter than the sidereal month. After one nodal precession period, the number of draconic months exceeds the number of sidereal months by exactly one. This period is about 6,793 days (18.60 years).

As a result of this nodal precession, the time for the Sun to return to the same lunar node, the eclipse year, is about 18.6377 days shorter than a sidereal year. The number of solar orbits (years) during one lunar nodal precession period equals the period of orbit (one year) divided by this difference, minus one:  − 1.

The precession cycle affects the heights of tides. During half the cycle, the high and low tides are less extreme; in the other half of the cycle, they are amplified, with high tides greater than average and low tides lower than average.

<doc id="242682" wikidata="Q17126358" url="?curid=242682" title="Sensation (fiction)">
<text>Sensation is the fiction-writing mode for portraying a character&#x27;s perception of the senses. According to Ron Rozelle, &quot;...the success of your story or novel will depend on many things, but the most crucial is your ability to bring your reader into it. And that reader will be most completely in when you deliver the actual sensations of the many things that comprise your story&quot; . As stated by Jessica Page Morrell, &quot;You breathe life into fiction by translating the senses onto the page, producing stories rooted in the physical world ... that creates a tapestry, a galaxy of interwoven sensory ingredients.&quot; 

Also according to Rozelle, &quot;The sensation of what something feels like is used to describe everything from sensual pleasure to pain and torture. It&#x27;s a wide range, and your readers have actually experienced only some of those feelings. So your job is to either make them recall exactly what it feels like when something occurs in your story or, if they haven&#x27;t experienced it, what it would feel like if they did&quot; . Morrell describes a &quot;sensory surround&quot;, which when &quot;coupled with drama tugs the reader into [the] story and forces him to keep reading.&quot; 

The importance of conveying sensation in fiction is widely accepted. However, recognition of sensation as a distinct fiction-writing mode is a matter of discussion.

<doc id="242683" wikidata="Q1321468" url="?curid=242683" title="Ozarks">
<text>The Ozarks, also known as the Ozark Mountains, Ozark Highlands or Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic region in the U.S. states of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as a small area in the southeastern corner of Kansas. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of northern Arkansas and most of the southern half of Missouri, extending from Interstate 40 in central Arkansas to Interstate 70 in central Missouri.

There are two mountain ranges in the Ozarks: the Boston Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, as well as the St. Francois Mountains of Missouri. Wahzhazhe Summit (formerly known as Buffalo Lookout), is the highest point in the Ozarks at , and is located in the Boston Mountains, in the westernmost part of Newton County, Arkansas, east of Boston, Madison County, Arkansas. Geologically, the area is a broad dome with the exposed core in the ancient St. Francois Mountains. The Ozarks cover nearly , making it the most extensive highland region between the Appalachians and Rockies. Together with the Ouachita Mountains, the area is known as the U.S. Interior Highlands.

The Salem Plateau, named after Salem, Missouri, makes up the largest geologic area of the Ozarks. The second largest is the Springfield Plateau, named after Springfield, Missouri, nicknamed the &quot;Queen City of the Ozarks&quot;. On the northern Ozark border are the cities of St. Louis and Columbia, Missouri. Significant Ozark cities in Arkansas include Fayetteville, Bentonville, Springdale, Eureka Springs, and Fort Smith. Branson, just north of the Arkansas–Missouri border, is a tourist destination where Ozark culture is popularized.

==Etymology==
The toponym &quot;Ozarks&quot; may derive from an English-language adaptation of the French abbreviation (short for , meaning &quot;of/at/to the Arkansas (Quapaw) [plural]&quot;). In the decades prior to the French and Indian War of 1754 to 1763, referred to France&#x27;s trading post at Arkansas Post, located in the wooded Arkansas Delta lowland area above the confluence of the Arkansas River with the Mississippi River.

Another possible etymological origin might be the French phrase , meaning &quot;[land] of the arches&quot;, in reference to the dozens of natural bridges formed by erosion and collapsed caves in the Ozark region. These include Clifty Hollow Natural Bridge (actually a series of arches) in Missouri, and Alum Cove in the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest.

By the early 20th century, the term &quot;Ozarks&quot; had entered common parlance.

==Physiographic subregions==
The Ozarks consist of five physiographic subregions: the Boston Mountains of north Arkansas and Cookson Hills of east Oklahoma; the Springfield Plateau of southwest Missouri, northeast Oklahoma, and northwest Arkansas and including Springfield, Joplin and Monett/Aurora in Missouri, Tahlequah in Oklahoma, and Fayetteville and Harrison in Arkansas; the White River Hills along the White River, including Branson and Mountain Home to Batesville; the Salem Plateau or Central Plateau, which includes a broad band across south central Missouri and north central Arkansas including the Lebanon, Salem and West Plains areas; the Courtois Hills of southeastern Missouri; the Osage-Gasconade Hills around the Lake of the Ozarks; the Saint Francois Mountains; and the Missouri River and Mississippi River border areas along the eastern and northeastern flanks.

Karst features such as springs, losing streams, sinkholes and caves are common in the limestones of the Springfield Plateau and abundant in the dolomite bedrock of the Salem Plateau and Boston Mountains. Missouri is known as &quot;The Cave State&quot; with over 7,300 recorded caves, second in number only to Tennessee. The majority of these caves are found in the Ozark counties. The Ozark Plateaus aquifer system affects groundwater movement in all areas except the igneous core of the St. Francois Mountains. Geographic features include limestone and dolomite glades, which are rocky, desert-like areas on hilltops. Kept open by periodic fires that limit growth of grasses and forbs in shallow soil, glades are home to collared lizards, tarantulas, scorpions, cacti and other species more typical of the Desert Southwest.

The Boston Mountains contain the highest elevations of the Ozarks, with peaks over , and form some of the greatest relief of any formation between the Appalachians and Rocky Mountains. The Ouachita Mountains to the south rise a few hundred feet higher, but are not geographically associated with the Ozarks. The Boston Mountains portion of the Ozarks extends north of the Arkansas River Valley , is approximately long, and is bordered by the Springfield and Salem Plateau to the north of the White River. Summits can reach elevations of just over , with valleys deep. Turner Ward Knob is the highest named peak. Found in western Newton County, Arkansas, its elevation is . Nearby, five unnamed peaks have elevations at or slightly above . Drainage is primarily to the White River, with the exception of the Illinois River, although there also is considerable drainage from the south slopes of the Boston Mountains to the Arkansas River. Major streams of this type include Lee Creek, Frog Bayou, Mulberry River, Spadra Creek, Big Piney Creek, Little Piney Creek, Illinois Bayou, Point Remove Creek, and Cadron Creek. Many Ozark waterways have their headwaters in the uplands of the Boston formation, including the Buffalo, Kings, Mulberry, Little Red and White rivers.

Topography is mostly gently rolling in the Springfield and Salem plateaus, whereas the Saint Francois Mountains are more rugged. Although the Springfield formation&#x27;s surface is primarily Mississippian limestone and chert, the Salem Plateau is made of older Ordovician dolomites, limestones, and sandstones. Both are rife with karst topography and form long, flat plains. The formations are separated by steep escarpments that dramatically interrupt the rolling hills. Although much of the Springfield Plateau has been denuded of the surface layers of the Boston Mountains, large remnants of these younger layers are present throughout the southern end of the formation, possibly suggesting a peneplain process. The Springfield Plateau drains through wide, mature streams ultimately feeding the White River.

==Geology==
The St. Francois Mountains in the northeastern Ozarks are the eroded remnants of an ancient range which form the geological core of the highland dome. The igneous and volcanic rocks of the St. Francois Mountains are the exposed remains of a Proterozoic mountain range hundreds of millions of years old. The remaining hills are the exposed portion of an extensive terrane (the Spavinaw terrane in part) of granitic and rhyolitic rocks dating from 1485 to 1350 mya that stretches from Ohio to western Oklahoma. The core of the range existed as an island in the Paleozoic seas. Reef complexes occur in the sedimentary layers surrounding this ancient island. These flanking reefs were points of concentration for later ore-bearing fluids which formed the rich lead-zinc ores that have been and continue to be mined in the area. The igneous and volcanic rocks extend at depth under the relatively thin veneer of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and form the basal crust of the entire region.
A major unconformity in the region attests that the Ozarks were above sea level for several hundred million years from the time of the volcanism in the Precambrian until the mid-Cambrian with an erosionally produced relief of up to . The seas encroached during the late Cambrian producing the Lamotte Sandstone, thick, followed by carbonate sedimentation. Coral reefs formed around the granite and rhyolite islands in this Cambrian sea. This carbonate formation, the Bonneterre, now mostly dolomite, is exposed around the St. Francis Mountains, but extends in the subsurface throughout the Ozarks and reaches a thickness of . The Bonneterre is overlain by of dolomite, often sandy, silty or cherty, forming the Elvins Group and the Potosi and Eminence formations. Withdrawal of the seas resulted in another unconformity during the latest Cambrian and early Ordovician periods. Hydrothermal mineralizing fluids formed the rich lead ore deposits of the Lead Belt during this time.

Sedimentation resumed in the Ordovician with the deposition of the Gunter sandstone, the Gasconade dolomite and the prominent Roubidoux sandstone and dolomite. The sandstone of the Roubidoux forms prominent bluffs along the streams eroding into the southern part of the Salem Plateau. The Roubidoux and Gunter sandstones serve as significant aquifers when present in the subsurface. The source of the sands is considered to be the emerging Wisconsin Dome to the northeast. The Ozark region remained as a subsiding shallow carbonate shelf environment with a significant thickness of cherty dolomites such as the Jefferson City, Cotter and Powell formations.

Portions of the Ozark Plateau, the Springfield Plateau of southwest Missouri and northern Arkansas, are underlain by Mississippian cherty limestones locally referred to as &quot;Boone chert&quot;, consisting of limestone and chert layers. These are eroded and form steep hills, valleys and bluffs.

The Boston Mountains are a high and deeply dissected plateau. The rocks of the region are essentially little disturbed, flat-lying sedimentary layers of Paleozoic age. The highest ridges and peaks are capped by Pennsylvanian sandstone such as the basal Atoka and the &quot;Middle Bloyd&quot;. The deeply eroded valleys are cut into Mississippian limestone and below that layer Ordovician dolomite.

During the Pennsylvanian period, the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic, the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.

==Ecology and conservation==
Formal conservation in the region began when the Ozark National Forest was created by proclamation of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908 to preserve across five Arkansas counties. Another were added the following year. The initial forest included area as far south as Mount Magazine and as far east as Sylamore.

In 1939, Congress established Mark Twain National Forest at nine sites in Missouri. Wildlife management areas were founded in the 1920s and &#x27;30s to restore populations to viable numbers. In the 1930s and 1940s Aldo Leopold, Arthur Carhart and Bob Marshall developed a &quot;wilderness&quot; policy for the Forest Service. Their efforts bore fruit with The Wilderness Act of 1964 which designated wilderness areas &quot;where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by men, where man himself is a visitor and does not remain&quot;, though this included second growth public forests like the Mark Twain National Forest.

Land was also added to Ozark National Forest during this period, with over in total additions. Some land was reclaimed by the government through the Resettlement Administration during the Great Depression. In 1976, Congress established the Hercules Glades Wilderness, the first of 13 designated wilderness areas in the Ozarks. In 1986, Congress established the Ozark Plateau National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Oklahoma. Protected areas ensure the recovery of endangered and threatened species of animals and plants, including the red wolf, Ozark big-eared bat, Indiana bat, eastern small-footed bat, southeastern bat, southeastern big-eared bat; longnose darter, Ozark cavefish, Ozark cave crayfish, Bowman&#x27;s cave amphipod, Ozark cave amphipod, bat cave isopod; and Ozark chinquapin. It is a habitat of migratory birds and contains geological, archeological, historical, and paleontological resources.

Commercial farms and processing operations are known to raise levels of chemical and biological contaminants in Ozark streams, threatening water supplies, recreational use and endangered native species.

==Lakes and streams==


Many of the rivers and streams in the Ozarks have been dammed. Most of the dams in the region were initially built for the dual purpose of flood control and hydropower generation but have also become major economic drivers through recreational use in places such as Branson, Missouri, and Mountain Home, Arkansas.

The Army Corps of Engineers among others, operates multiple dams in the Ozarks region. Some of the largest lakes created by these dams are on the White River. Beginning in 1911 with the construction of Powersite Dam on the White River near Branson, Missouri and the impoundment of Lake Taneycomo the Ozarks rivers have been harnessed for electrical power, recreation, and flood control. After the President Franklin D, Roosevelt signed the Flood Control Act of 1938, six large flood control dams were constructed on the White River and its tributaries.

* Beaver Dam on the White River – Beaver Lake
* Table Rock Dam on the White River – Table Rock Lake
* Bull Shoals Dam on the White River – Bull Shoals Lake
* Norfork Dam on the North Fork River – Norfolk Lake
* Greers Ferry Lake on the Little Red River – Greers Ferry Lake
* Clearwater Dam on the Black River – Clearwater Lake

Multiple smaller lakes have been created by dams in the White River basin from 1911 through 1960. These smaller lakes include Lake Sequoyah, a small recreational fishing lake east of Fayetteville, Arkansas, formed in 1961; Sequoyah is the uppermost impoundment on the White River. Below Sequoyah (northeast of Fayetteville) is Beaver Lake, formed in 1960. The White River continues northeasterly into Table Rock Lake (1958) in Missouri, which feeds directly into Lake Taneycomo, where the river zigzags southeasterly into Arkansas forming Bull Shoals Lake along the Arkansas-Missouri line. Completed in 1952, Bull Shoals is the furthest downstream lake on the White River proper. Norfork Lake was formed by damming the North Fork River, a tributary of the White River, in 1941.

Additional large lakes in the Ozarks region include Lake of the Ozarks, Pomme de Terre Lake, and Truman Lake in the northern Ozarks. These three lakes were formed by impounding the Osage River and its tributary the Pomme de Terre River in 1931, 1961 and 1979 respectively.

Grand Lake o&#x27; the Cherokee in northeast Oklahoma, on the western portion of the Ozark Plateau, was created in 1940 with the damming of the Grand River. Stockton Lake was formed in 1969 by damming the Sac River near the city of Stockton, Missouri, and supplements the water supply of Springfield in nearby Greene County.

The creation of the lakes significantly altered the Ozark landscape and affected traditional Ozark culture through displacement. The streams provided water and power to communities, farms and mills concentrated in the valleys prior to impoundment. Many cemeteries, farm roads, river fords and railways were lost when the lakes came, disrupting rural culture, travel and commerce. Baxter County, Arkansas, alone saw nearly 400 people displaced to make way for the reservoir created by Norfork Dam. The town of Forsyth, Missouri, was relocated in its entirety to a spot from its previous location. Prior to damming, rivers and streams in the White and Osage River basins were of similar character to the current conditions of the Buffalo, Elk, Niangua, Gasconade, Big Piney, Current, Jacks Fork, Eleven Point and Meramec rivers.

Because of the success of the Army Corps efforts to dam the large rivers in the Ozarks, the Ozarks Society began protests to keep the other rivers in the Ozarks free flowing. The Buffalo National River was created by an Act of Congress in 1972 as the nation&#x27;s first National River, administered by the National Park Service. The designation came after over a decade of battling a proposed Army Corps dam in the media, legislature, and courts to keep the Buffalo River free flowing. The Ozark Society, the main force behind the dam protest, still leads the fight to keep the Buffalo River pristine and protected. Today, the Buffalo River sees approximately 800,000 visitors camping, canoeing, floating, hiking, and tubing annually. In Missouri, the Ozark National Scenic Riverways was established in 1964 along the Current and Jacks Fork rivers as the first US national park based on a river system. The Eleven Point River is included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System established in 1968. These parks and rivers are a major economic driver for some of the least populated counties in Arkansas and Missouri, attracting up to 1.5 million tourists annually.

Many other waterways and streams have their headwaters in the Boston Mountains portion of the Ozarks such as the Mulberry River, the White River, War Eagle Creek, Little Mulberry Creek, Lee Creek, Big Piney Creek, and the Little Red River. To the south, the Arkansas River valley separates the Boston Mountains from the Ouachita Mountains.

Missouri Ozark rivers include the Gasconade, Big Piney, and Niangua rivers in the north central region. The Meramec River and its tributaries Huzzah Creek and Courtois Creek are found in the northeastern Ozarks. The Black and St. Francis rivers mark the eastern crescent of the Ozarks. The James, Spring and North Fork rivers are in south-central Missouri. Forming the west central border of the Ozarks from Missouri through Kansas and into Oklahoma are the Spring River and its tributary, Center Creek. Grand Falls, Missouri&#x27;s largest natural waterfall, a chert outcropping, includes bluffs and glades on Shoal Creek south of Joplin. All these river systems see heavy recreational use in season, including the Elk River in southwestern Missouri and its tributary Big Sugar Creek.

Ozark rivers and streams are typically clear water, with baseflows sustained by many seeps and springs, and flow through forests along limestone and dolomite bluffs. Gravel bars are common along shallow banks, while deep holes are found along bluffs. Except during periods of heavy rain or snow melt — when water levels rise quite rapidly — their level of difficulty is suitable for most canoeing and tubing.

Fish hatcheries are common due to the abundance of springs and waterways. The Neosho National Fish Hatchery was built in 1888; it was the first federal hatchery. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, Missouri Department of Conservation and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service operate numerous warm and cold water hatcheries and trout parks; private hatcheries such as at Rockbridge are found throughout the region.

==Regional economy==

===Traditional economic activity===
The Ozarks contain ore deposits of lead, zinc, iron and barite. Many of these deposits have been depleted by historic mining activities, but much remains and is currently being mined in the Lead Belt of southeastern Missouri. Historically, the lead belt around the Saint Francois Mountains and the Tri-State district lead-zinc mining area around Joplin, Missouri, have been important sources of metals. Mining practices common in the early 20th century left significant abandoned underground mine problems and heavy metal contamination in topsoil and groundwater in the Tri-State district.

Much of the area supports beef cattle ranching, and dairy farming is common across the area. Dairy farms are usually cooperative affairs, with small farms selling to a corporate wholesaler, who packages product under a common brand for retail sales. Petroleum exploration and extraction also takes place in the Oklahoma portion of the Ozarks, as well as in the east half of the Boston Mountains in Arkansas. Logging of both softwood and hardwood timber species on both private land and in the National Forests has long been an important economic activity.

The majority of the Ozarks is forested. Oak-hickory is the predominant type; eastern junipers are common, with stands of pine often seen in the southern range. Less than a quarter of the region has been cleared for pasture and cropland. Forests that were heavily logged during the early-to-mid-20th century have recovered; much of the remaining timber in the Ozarks is second-growth forest. However, deforestation of frontier forest contributed through erosion to increased gravel bars along Ozark waterways in logged areas; stream channels have become wider and shallower, and deepwater fish habitat has been lost.
The numerous rivers and streams of the region saw hundreds of water-powered timber and grist mills. Mills were important centers of culture and commerce; dispersed widely throughout the region, mills served local needs, often thriving within a few miles of another facility. Few Ozark mills relied on inefficient water wheels for power; most utilized a dam, millrace and water turbine.

During the New Deal, the Civilian Conservation Corps employed hundreds in the construction of nearly 400 fire lookouts throughout the Ozarks at 121 known sites in Arkansas and 257 in Missouri. Of those lookouts, about half remain, and many of them are in use by the U.S. Forest Service. A 2007 report by the National Trust for Historic Preservation deemed these fire lookouts and related structures as one of America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.

In the 1960s, federal activity promoted modernization, especially through better transportation and tourism. The Ozarks Regional Commission sponsored numerous projects.

===Current economic activities===

Tourism is the growth industry of the Ozarks as evidenced by the growth of the Branson, Missouri, entertainment center celebrating traditional Ozark culture. The rapidly growing Northwest Arkansas metropolitan area has also become a tourist hub, drawing nationwide attention for the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Poultry farming and food processing are significant industries throughout the region. The Tyson Foods corporation and ConAgra Foods each operates several hundred poultry farms and processing plants throughout the Ozarks. Schreiber Foods has operations throughout southern Missouri.

The trucking industry is important to the regional economy, with national carriers based there including J. B. Hunt, ABF, and Prime, Inc. Springfield remains an operational hub for the BNSF Railway. Logging and timber industries are also significant in the Ozark economy, with operations ranging from small family-run sawmills to large commercial concerns. Fortune 500 companies such as Wal-Mart, Leggett &amp; Platt, Bass Pro Shops, and O&#x27;Reilly Auto Parts are based in the Ozarks.

The area is home to several Missouri wine and spirit regions, including the Ozark Highlands and Ozark Mountain American Viticultural Areas, and the Ozark Highland Spirits Region. There are a number of microbreweries throughout the region.

==Culture==

&quot;Ozark&quot; also refers to the distinctive culture, architecture, and dialect shared by the people who live on the plateau. Early settlers in Missouri were pioneers who came west from the Southern Appalachians at the beginning of the 19th century, followed in the 1840s and 1850s by Irish and German immigrants. Much of the Ozark population is of English, Scots-Irish, and German descent, and the Ozark families from which the regional culture derived tend to have lived in the area since the 19th century.
Early settlers relied on hunting, fishing, trapping, and foraging to supplement their diets and incomes. Today hunting and fishing for recreation are common activities and an important part of the tourist industry. Foraging for mushrooms (especially morels) and for ginseng is common and financially supported by established buyers in the area. Other forages include poke, watercress, persimmons and pawpaw; wild berries such as blackberry, black raspberry, raspberry, red mulberry, black cherry, wild strawberry and dewberry; and wild nuts such as black walnut and even acorns. Edible native legumes, wild grasses and wildflowers are plentiful, and beekeeping is common.

Print and broadcast media have explored Ozark culture broadly. Books set in the Ozarks include &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;, &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot;, and &quot;As a Friend&quot;. The 1999 film &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot;, based on the book &quot;Woe to Live On&quot;, depicts conflict in southwest Missouri during the Civil War. &quot;Winter&#x27;s Bone&quot;, a novel by Daniel Woodrell (author of &quot;Woe to Live On&quot;), reflects on contemporary methamphetamine culture and its impact on families on the plateau. Released as a feature film in 2010, &quot;Winter&#x27;s Bone&quot; received the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, as well as other awards. Several early and influential country-music television and radio programs originated from Springfield in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, including ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; and &quot;The Slim Wilson Show&quot; on KYTV. The Clampett clan of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; TV show provide a stereotypical depiction of Ozark people. Ozark musicians include Porter Wagoner and old-time fiddler Bob Holt. Netflix drama series &quot;Ozark&quot; takes place in Osage Beach, Missouri and revolves around the well-to-do Byrde family as their lives are uprooted and they are forced to move from Chicago to the Ozarks after a money laundering scheme goes wrong. The series focuses on the Byrdes&#x27; dealings in the Ozarks, as well as their interactions with local Ozark crime families. The series premiered on July 21, 2017.

Examples of commercial interpretations of traditional Ozark culture include the two major family theme parks in the region, Silver Dollar City and the now defunct Dogpatch USA, and the resort entertainment complex in Branson. Ozark Folkways in Winslow, Arkansas, and Ozark Folk Center State Park in Mountain View, Arkansas, interpret regional culture through musical performance and exhibitions of pioneer skills and crafts.

Traditional Ozark culture includes stories and tunes passed orally between generations through community music parties and other informal gatherings. Many of these tunes and tales can be traced to British origins and to German folklore. Moreover, historian Vance Randolph attributes the formation of much Ozark lore to individual families when &quot;backwoods parents begin by telling outrageous whoppers to their children and end by half believing the wildest of these tales themselves.&quot; Randolph collected Ozark folklore and lyrics in volumes such as the national bestseller &quot;Pissing in the Snow and Other Ozark Folktales&quot; (University of Illinois Press, 1976), &quot;Ozark Folksongs&quot; (University of Missouri Press, 1980), a four-volume anthology of regional songs and ballads collected in the 1920s and 1930s, and &quot;Ozark Magic and Folklore&quot; (Courier Dover Publications, 1964). Evidenced by Randolph&#x27;s extensive field work, many Ozark anecdotes from the oral tradition are often bawdy, full of wild embellishments on everyday themes. In 1941–42, commissioned by Alan Lomax of the Archive of Folk Culture, Randolph returned to the Ozarks with a portable recording machine from the Library of Congress and captured over 800 songs, ballads and instrumentals. Selected from among these several hundred recordings, 35 tracks were released on &quot;Various Artists: Ozark Folksongs&quot; (Rounder Records) in 2001.

Square dances were an important social avenue throughout the Ozarks into the 20th century. Square dances sprang up wherever people concentrated around mills and timber camps, springs, fords, and in towns small and large. Geographically isolated communities saw their own local dance tunes and variations develop. Of all the traditional musicians in the Ozarks, the fiddler holds a distinct place in both the community and folklore. Community fiddlers were revered for carrying local tunes; regionally, traveling fiddlers brought new tunes and entertainment, even while many viewed their arrival as a threat to morality. In 2007, Gordon McCann, a chronicler of Ozarks folklife and fiddle music for over four decades, donated a collection of audio recordings, fieldnotes and photographs to Missouri State University in Springfield. The collection includes more than 3,000 hours of fiddle music and interviews recorded at jam sessions, music parties, concerts and dances in the Ozarks. Selected audio recordings along with biographical sketches, photographs and tune histories were published in Drew Beisswenger and Gordon McCann&#x27;s 2008 book/37-track CD set &quot;Mel Bay Presents Ozarks Fiddle Music: 308 Tunes Featuring 30 Legendary Fiddlers With Selections from 50 Other Great Ozarks Fiddlers&quot;.
From 1973 to 1983, the Bittersweet project, which began as an English class at Lebanon High School in Missouri, collected 476 taped and transcribed interviews, published 482 stories, and took over 50,000 photographs documenting traditional Ozark culture.

Population influx since the 1950s, coupled with geographically lying in both the Midwest and Upper South, proximity to the Mississippi embayment, the Osage and Northern Plains, contributes to changing cultural values in the Ozarks. Theme parks and theatres seen to reflect regional values have little in common with traditional Ozark culture. Community tradition bearers remain active, in decreasing numbers, far afield of commercial offers.

===Religion===
Ozark religion, like that of Appalachia, was predominantly Baptist and Methodist during periods of early settlement; it tends to the conservative or individualistic, with Episcopalians, Assemblies of God, Baptists including Southern Baptists, Church of Christ, Pentecostals, and other Protestant denominations present, as well as Catholics. Religious organizations headquartered in the Ozarks include the Assemblies of God and Baptist Bible Fellowship International in Springfield and the General Association of General Baptists in Poplar Bluff.

<text>The mole salamanders (genus Ambystoma) are a group of advanced salamanders endemic to North America. The group has become famous due to the study of the axolotl (&quot;A. mexicanum&quot;) in research on paedomorphosis, and the tiger salamander (&quot;A. tigrinum, A. mavortium&quot;) which is often sold as a pet, and is the official amphibian of four US states.

==General description==
Terrestrial mole salamanders are identified by having wide, protruding eyes, prominent costal grooves, and thick arms. Most have vivid patterning on dark backgrounds, with marks ranging from deep blue spots to large yellow bars depending on the species. Terrestrial adults spend most of their lives underground in burrows, either of their own making or abandoned by other animals. Some northern species may hibernate in these burrows throughout the winter. They live alone and feed on any available invertebrate. Adults spend little time in the water, only returning to the ponds of their birth to breed.

All mole salamanders are oviparous and lay large eggs in clumps in the water. Their fully aquatic larvae are branchiate, with three pairs of external gills behind their heads and above their gill slits. Larvae have large caudal fins, which extend from the back of their heads to their tails and to their cloacae. Larvae grow limbs soon after hatching, with four toes on the fore arms, and five toes on the hind legs. Their eyes are wide-set and lack true eyelids.

The larvae of some species (especially those in the south, and tiger salamanders) can reach their adult size before undergoing metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the gills of the larvae disappear, as do the fins. Their tails, skin, and limbs become thicker, and the eyes develop lids. Their lungs become fully developed, allowing for a fully terrestrial existence.

Some species of mole salamanders (as well as populations of normally terrestrial species) are neotenic (retaining their larval form into adulthood). The most famous example is the axolotl. They cannot produce thyroxine, so their only means of metamorphosis is mainly through the outside injection of it. This usually shortens the lifespan of the salamander.

==Tiger salamander complex==

Morphologically, tiger salamanders (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot; complex) have large heads, small eyes, and thick bodies. This basic morphology is similar across most mole salamanders (genus &quot;Ambystoma&quot;), though tiger salamanders are among the largest of the mole salamanders, and have relatively large larvae. 

Tiger salamanders inhabit a wide variety of ecosystems across North America. Given this geographic diversity, subpopulations of tiger salamanders exhibit morphological and behavioral diversity. Whether subpopulations constitute independent species or subspecies within the &quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot; complex, as well as the driving forces behind diversification, remains an active area of research as of 2024. Several subspecies within the &quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot; complex have been reclassified as an independent species. For example:

# &quot;Ambystoma mavortium&quot; (barred tiger salamander) comprises former subspecies &quot;A. t. diaboli&quot;, &quot;A. t. mavortium&quot;, &quot;A. t. melanostictum&quot;, &quot;A. t. nebulosum&quot;, and &quot;A. t. stebbinsi.&quot; 
# &quot;Ambystoma californiense&quot; (California tiger salamander) 
# &quot;Ambystoma velasci&quot; (Plateau tiger salamander), which may be paraphyletic and shares habitats with axolotl (&quot;A. mexicanum&quot;)

== Hybrid all-female populations ==
Unisexual (all-female) populations of ambystomatid salamanders are widely distributed across the Great Lakes region and northeastern North America. The females require sperm from a co‑occurring, related species to fertilize their eggs and initiate development. Usually the eggs then discard the sperm genome and develop asexually (i.e., gynogenesis, with premeiotic doubling); however, they may incorporate the genome from the sperm into the resulting offspring. Sperm incorporation commonly takes the form of genome addition (resulting in ploidy elevation in the offspring), or genome replacement, wherein one of the maternal genomes is discarded. This unique mode of reproduction has been termed kleptogenesis by Bogart and colleagues. This is in contrast to hybridogenesis, where the maternal genomes are passed hemiclonally and the paternal genome is discarded every generation before the egg matures and reacquired from the sperm of another species.

The nuclear DNA of the unisexuals generally comprises genomes from up to five species: the blue-spotted salamander (&quot;A. laterale&quot;), Jefferson salamander (&quot;A. jeffersonianum&quot;), small-mouthed salamander (&quot;A. texanum&quot;), streamside salamander (&quot;A. barbouri&quot;), and tiger salamander (&quot;A. tigrinum&quot;), denoted respectively as L, J, Tx, B, and Ti. This flexibility results in a large number of possible nuclear biotypes (genome combinations) in the unisexuals. For example, an LJJ individual would be a triploid with one &quot;A. laterale&quot; genome and two &quot;A. jeffersonianum&quot; genomes, while an LTxJTi individual would be a tetraploid with genomes from four species. Because they have hybrid genomes, unisexual salamanders are a cryptic species with morphology similar to coexisting species. For example, LLJs look like blue-spotted salamanders and LJJs look like Jefferson salamanders. Silvery salamanders LJJ (&quot;A. platineum&quot;), Tremblay&#x27;s salamanders LLJ (&quot;A. tremblayi&quot;), and Kelly&#x27;s Island salamanders LTxTx and LTxTi (&quot;A. nothagenes&quot;) were initially described as species. Species names were later dropped for all unisexual salamanders because of the complexity of their genomes. The offspring of a single mother may have different genome complements; for example, a single egg mass may have both LLJJ and LJJ larvae.

Despite the complexity of the nuclear genome, all unisexuals form a monophyletic group based on their mitochondrial DNA. The maternal ancestor of the unisexual ambystomatids was most closely related to the streamside salamander, with the original hybridization likely occurring 2.4~3.9 million years ago, making it the oldest known lineage of all-female vertebrates. The hybridization was most probably with an &quot;A. laterale&quot;. All known unisexuals have at least one &quot;A. laterale&quot; genome and this is thought to be essential for unisexuality. However, the &quot;A. laterale&quot; genome has been replaced several times, independently, in each of the lineages by matings with &quot;A. laterale&quot;.
==Limb regeneration==

&quot;Ambystoma mexicanum&quot;, a neotenic salamander with exceptional regenerative capabilities is one of the principal models for studying limb regeneration. Limb regeneration involves the propagation of a mass of low differentiated and highly proliferative cells termed the blastema. During limb regeneration, blastema cells experience DNA double-strand breaks and thus require homologous recombination, a form of DNA repair that deals with double-strand breaks.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Rhyacosiredon&quot; was previously considered a separate genus within the family Ambystomatidae. However, cladistic analysis of the mole salamanders found the existence of &quot;Rhyacosiredon&quot; makes &quot;Ambystoma&quot; paraphyletic, since the species are more closely related to some &quot;Ambystoma&quot; species than those species are to others in &quot;Ambystoma&quot;. The stream-type morphology of these salamanders (which includes larvae and neotenes with short gills and thicker gular folds) may have led to their misclassification as a different genus.

The genus name &quot;Ambystoma&quot; was given by Johann Jakob von Tschudi in 1839. Tschudi did not provide a derivation for the name, and many thought that he intended the name &quot;Amblystoma&quot;, &quot;blunt-mouth.&quot; Occasionally, old specimens and documents use the name &quot;Amblystoma&quot;. Writing in 1907, Leonhard Stejneger offered a derivation of &quot;Ambystoma&quot; based on a contraction of a Greek phrase meaning &quot;to cram into the mouth&quot;, but others have not found this explanation convincing. In the absence of clear evidence that Tschudi committed a lapsus, the name given in 1839 stands.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Ambystoma&quot; contains 32 species, listed below, the newest being &quot;A. bishopi&quot;. Some species are Terrestrial, others are neotenic, and some species have established populations of both neotenic and terrestrial forms.

In addition, two groups of unisexual hybrid populations are sometimes named under their own species:

* Silvery salamander (&quot;A. platineum&quot;)
* Tremblay&#x27;s salamander (&quot;A. tremblayi&quot;)

<text>The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) is a species of mole salamander and one of the largest terrestrial salamanders in North America.

==Description==

These salamanders usually grow to a length of with a lifespan of around 12–15 years. They are characterized by having markings varying in color on the back of their head, body, and tail. The coloring of these spots range from brownish yellow to greenish yellow, while the rest of their back is black or dark brown. They are smooth bodied, with costal grooves running down their sides to aid in moisture control. They have short snouts, thick necks, strong legs, and lengthy tails. Tiger salamanders are a sexually dimorphic species, as the males are larger in body size, as well as have longer and higher tails than females. Some individuals, typically when their aquatic environment is well suited, will retain their larval characteristics and forego metamorphosis. These paedomorphic individuals retain their gills and remain aquatic. Their diet consists largely of small insects, snails, slugs, frogs, and worms, although it is not rare for an adult to turn cannibalistic and consume its own kind. Cannibalism in these salamanders can almost always be traced back to a large volume of competing predators and lack of prey in the area. If the opportunity presents itself, tiger salamanders will even feed on other smaller salamander species, lizards, snakelets (baby snakes), and newborn mice. When threatened, these salamanders will display their tail, which will then secrete a thick, white, poisonous substance. Pads on their feet help them dig through loose soil. 

== Habitat ==
Tiger salamanders habitats range from woodlands crowded with conifer and deciduous trees to grassy open fields. These amphibians are secretive creatures who spend most of their lives underground in burrows, making them difficult to spot. One significant requirement these salamanders need to thrive is loose soil for burrowing. After metamorphosis, adult tiger salamanders will migrate to a new territory. Females have been documented to migrate further than males, and larger individuals will migrate further than smaller ones. Tiger salamanders are almost entirely terrestrial as adults, and usually only return to the water to breed. The ideal breeding condition for tiger salamanders ranges from wetlands, such as cattle ponds and vernal pools, to flooded swamps. The colonization of wetlands by tiger salamanders has been positively related to the area, depth, and forest cover of the wetlands. This species is most commonly found on the Atlantic coast from New York down to Florida. They are known, however, to be the widest ranging species of salamander in North America and have been found in smaller populations from coast to coast. &quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot; populations occurring in northern and eastern regions of the United States are thought to be native populations as evidence from a study uncovered the species in these regions seem to be from relict populations. The species which occur on the west coast of the United States are not necessarily native occurring to the region and occur as a result of introduction for sport fishing bait, which has resulted in hybridization.
Though tiger salamanders are not indicators of an ecosystem, they are good indicators of a healthy environment because they need good moist soil to burrow in. But pond disturbance, invasive fish, and road construction threaten the annual population. In aquatic environments, higher pH and lower water conductivity have both been correlated with a larger population of males specifically.

== Breeding ==
Like all ambystomatids, they are extremely loyal to their birthplaces, and will travel long distances to reach them. Tiger salamanders have been shown to travel up to 255 meters after their breeding cycles are complete, which is likely them returning to their original home ranges. Some research has shown that females will travel farther than males. However, a single tiger salamander has only a 50% chance of breeding more than once in its lifetime. In a study conducted in South Carolina, breeding migrations of adult tiger salamanders began in late October or November for males and November through February for females. The tiger salamander&#x27;s ideal breeding period is somewhere between the late winter and early spring, once the ground is warm enough and the water is thawed. Males nudge a willing female to initiate mating, and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom. Some males known as sneaker males will mimic female behavior in order to trick females in taking their spermatophore without alerting the male rival. There appears to be no relation between size and mating success. However, females prefer mates with longer tails over mates with shorter tails. It has also been shown that males with longer bodies can compete better against other males, though this has no significant impact on success. About 48 hours after insemination, the female is ready to deposit her eggs in the breeding pool. One female can lay up to 25–30 eggs per egg mass. She carefully attaches the eggs to secure twigs, grass, and leaves at the bottom of the pool to ensure her eggs safety. In about 12–15 days time, the eggs will be fully hatched and ready to mature in the pool. It takes a tiger salamander approximately three months to reach full maturity and leave the breeding pool. The distance the young will travel from the breeding pond has been shown to be correlated with body size, with large individuals traveling just as far as females. Large-scale captive breeding of tiger salamanders has not been accomplished, for unknown reasons.

The larva is entirely aquatic, and is characterized by large external gills and a prominent caudal fin that originates just behind the head, similar to the Mexican axolotl. Limbs are fully developed within a short time of hatching. Some larvae, especially in seasonal pools and in the north, may metamorphose as soon as feasible. These are known as small morph adults. Other larvae, especially in ancestral pools and warmer climates, may not metamorphose until fully adult size. These large larvae are usually known as &#x27;waterdogs&#x27;, and are used extensively in the fishing bait and pet trades. Some populations may not metamorphose at all, and become sexually mature while in their larval form. These are called neotenes, and are particularly common where terrestrial conditions are poor. Aquatic individuals of the eastern tiger salamander have been shown to prefer deeper water when compared to other salamander species.

== Diseases ==
Although immune themselves, tiger salamanders transmit the fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot;, which is a major worldwide threat to most frog species by causing the disease chytridiomycosis. Tiger salamanders also carry ranaviruses, which infect reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Using tiger salamander larvae as fishing bait appears to be a major source of exposure and transport to wild populations. One of these ranaviruses is even named the Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV). This ranavirus only transmits to other salamanders and was not found in fish or other amphibians. Severe mortality of tiger salamander larvae sometimes occurs from recurring ranavirus infections.

==Related species==
The California tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma californiense&quot;) (listed at Vulnerable), the barred tiger salamander (&quot;A. mavortium&quot;), and the plateau tiger salamander (&quot;A. velasci&quot;) were all once considered subspecies of &quot;A. tigrinum&quot;, but are now considered separate species. Genetic studies made it necessary to break up the original &quot;A. tigrinum&quot; population, though some hybridization between groups occurs.

The California tiger salamander is now federally listed as an endangered species mostly due to habitat loss; however, very few studies have been performed on this species.

The axolotl is also a relative of the tiger salamander. Axolotls live in a paedomorphic state, retaining most characteristics of their larval stage for their entire lifespans. While they never metamorphose under natural conditions, metamorphosis can be induced in them, resulting in a form very similar to the plateau tiger salamander. This is not, however, their natural condition, and dramatically shortens their lifespan. Recently, introgressed tiger salamander (&quot;A. tigrinum&quot;) DNA was detected in the laboratory axolotl population.

==In society and culture==
On February 2, 2005, Representative Bob Biggins introduced a bill to make the tiger salamander the official state amphibian of Illinois and to make the painted turtle the official state reptile. The bill was signed into law by Governor Rod Blagojevich on July 19, 2005.

<text>In mathematics, class field theory (CFT) is the fundamental branch of algebraic number theory whose goal is to describe all the abelian Galois extensions of local and global fields using objects associated to the ground field. 

Hilbert is credited as one of pioneers of the notion of a class field. However, this notion was already familiar to Kronecker and it was actually Weber who coined the term before Hilbert&#x27;s fundamental papers came out. The relevant ideas were developed in the period of several decades, giving rise to a set of conjectures by Hilbert that were subsequently proved by Takagi and Artin (with the help of Chebotarev&#x27;s theorem). 

One of the major results is: given a number field &quot;F&quot;, and writing &quot;K&quot; for the maximal abelian unramified extension of &quot;F&quot;, the Galois group of &quot;K&quot; over &quot;F&quot; is canonically isomorphic to the ideal class group of &quot;F&quot;. This statement was generalized to the so called Artin reciprocity law; in the idelic language, writing &quot;CF&quot; for the idele class group of &quot;F&quot;, and taking &quot;L&quot; to be any finite abelian extension of &quot;F&quot;, this law gives a canonical isomorphism

:formula_1

where formula_2 denotes the idelic norm map from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;F&quot;. This isomorphism is named the &quot;reciprocity map&quot;. 

The &quot;existence theorem&quot; states that the reciprocity map can be used to give a bijection between the set of abelian extensions of &quot;F&quot; and the set of closed subgroups of finite index of formula_3

A standard method for developing global class field theory since the 1930s was to construct local class field theory, which describes abelian extensions of local fields, and then use it to construct global class field theory. This was first done by Emil Artin and Tate using the theory of group cohomology, and in particular by developing the notion of class formations. Later, Neukirch found a proof of the main statements of global class field theory without using cohomological ideas. His method was explicit and algorithmic. 

Inside class field theory one can distinguish special class field theory and general class field theory. 

Explicit class field theory provides an explicit construction of maximal abelian extensions of a number field in various situations. This portion of the theory consists of Kronecker–Weber theorem, which can be used to construct the abelian extensions of formula_4, and the theory of complex multiplication to construct abelian extensions of CM-fields. 

There are three main generalizations of class field theory: higher class field theory, the Langlands program (or &#x27;Langlands correspondences&#x27;), and anabelian geometry.

==Formulation in contemporary language==

In modern mathematical language, class field theory (CFT) can be formulated as follows. Consider the &quot;maximal&quot; abelian extension &quot;A&quot; of a local or global field &quot;K&quot;. It is of infinite degree over &quot;K&quot;; the Galois group &quot;G&quot; of A over K is an infinite profinite group, so a compact topological group, and it is abelian. The central aims of class field theory are: to describe &quot;G&quot; in terms of certain appropriate topological objects associated to &quot;K&quot;, to describe finite abelian extensions of &quot;K&quot; in terms of open subgroups of finite index in the topological object associated to &quot;K&quot;. In particular, one wishes to establish a one-to-one correspondence between finite abelian extensions of &quot;K&quot; and their norm groups in this topological object for &quot;K&quot;. This topological object is the multiplicative group in the case of local fields with finite residue field and the idele class group in the case of global fields. The finite abelian extension corresponding to an open subgroup of finite index is called the class field for that subgroup, which gave the name to the theory.

The fundamental result of general class field theory states that the group &quot;G&quot; is naturally isomorphic to the profinite completion of &quot;CK&quot;, the multiplicative group of a local field or the idele class group of the global field, with respect to the natural topology on &quot;CK&quot; related to the specific structure of the field &quot;K&quot;. Equivalently, for any finite Galois extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, there is an isomorphism (the Artin reciprocity map)

:formula_5

of the abelianization of the Galois group of the extension with the quotient of the idele class group of &quot;K&quot; by the image of the norm of the idele class group of &quot;L&quot;.

For some small fields, such as the field of rational numbers formula_4 or its quadratic imaginary extensions there is a more detailed &quot;very explicit but too specific&quot; theory which provides more information. For example, the abelianized absolute Galois group &quot;G&quot; of formula_4 is (naturally isomorphic to) an infinite product of the group of units of the p-adic integers taken over all prime numbers &quot;p&quot;, and the corresponding maximal abelian extension of the rationals is the field generated by all roots of unity. This is known as the Kronecker–Weber theorem, originally conjectured by Leopold Kronecker. In this case the reciprocity isomorphism of class field theory (or Artin reciprocity map) also admits an explicit description due to the Kronecker–Weber theorem. However, principal constructions of such more detailed theories for small algebraic number fields are not extendable to the general case of algebraic number fields, and different conceptual principles are in use in the general class field theory.

The standard method to construct the reciprocity homomorphism is to first construct the local reciprocity isomorphism from the multiplicative group of the completion of a global field to the Galois group of its maximal abelian extension (this is done inside local class field theory) and then prove that the product of all such local reciprocity maps when defined on the idele group of the global field is trivial on the image of the multiplicative group of the global field. The latter property is called the &quot;global reciprocity law&quot; and is a far reaching generalization of the Gauss quadratic reciprocity law.

One of the methods to construct the reciprocity homomorphism uses class formation which derives class field theory from axioms of class field theory. This derivation is purely topological group theoretical, while to establish the axioms one has to use the ring structure of the ground field.

There are methods which use cohomology groups, in particular the Brauer group, and there are methods which do not use cohomology groups and are very explicit and fruitful for applications.

==History==
The origins of class field theory lie in the quadratic reciprocity law proved by Gauss. The generalization took place as a long-term historical project, involving quadratic forms and their &#x27;genus theory&#x27;, work of Ernst Kummer and Leopold Kronecker/Kurt Hensel on ideals and completions, the theory of cyclotomic and Kummer extensions.

The first two class field theories were very explicit cyclotomic and complex multiplication class field theories. They used additional structures: in the case of the field of rational numbers they use roots of unity, in the case of imaginary quadratic extensions of the field of rational numbers they use elliptic curves with complex multiplication and their points of finite order. Much later, the theory of Shimura provided another very explicit class field theory for a class of algebraic number fields. In positive characteristic formula_8, Kawada and Satake used Witt duality to get a very easy description of the formula_8-part of the reciprocity homomorphism.

However, these very explicit theories could not be extended to more general number fields. General class field theory used different concepts and constructions which work over every global field.

The famous problems of David Hilbert stimulated further development, which led to the reciprocity laws, and proofs by Teiji Takagi, Philipp Furtwängler, Emil Artin, Helmut Hasse and many others. The crucial Takagi existence theorem was known by 1920 and all the main results by about 1930. One of the last classical conjectures to be proved was the principalisation property. The first proofs of class field theory used substantial analytic methods. In the 1930s and subsequently saw the increasing use of infinite extensions and Wolfgang Krull&#x27;s theory of their Galois groups. This combined with Pontryagin duality to give a clearer if more abstract formulation of the central result, the Artin reciprocity law. An important step was the introduction of ideles by Claude Chevalley in the 1930s to replace ideal classes, essentially clarifying and simplifying the description of abelian extensions of global fields. Most of the central results were proved by 1940.

Later the results were reformulated in terms of group cohomology, which became a standard way to learn class field theory for several generations of number theorists. One drawback of the cohomological method is its relative inexplicitness. As the result of local contributions by Bernard Dwork, John Tate, Michiel Hazewinkel and a local and global reinterpretation by Jürgen Neukirch and also in relation to the work on explicit reciprocity formulas by many mathematicians, a very explicit and cohomology-free presentation of class field theory was established in the 1990s. (See, for example, &quot;Class Field Theory&quot; by Neukirch.)

==Applications==

Class field theory is used to prove Artin-Verdier duality. Very explicit class field theory is used in many subareas of algebraic number theory such as Iwasawa theory and Galois modules theory.

Most main achievements toward the Langlands correspondence for number fields, the BSD conjecture for number fields, and Iwasawa theory for number fields use very explicit but narrow class field theory methods or their generalizations. The open question is therefore to use generalizations of general class field theory in these three directions.

==Generalizations of class field theory==

There are three main generalizations, each of great interest. They are: the Langlands program, anabelian geometry, and higher class field theory.

Often, the Langlands correspondence is viewed as a nonabelian class field theory. If and when it is fully established, it would contain a certain theory of nonabelian Galois extensions of global fields. However, the Langlands correspondence does not include as much arithmetical information about finite Galois extensions as class field theory does in the abelian case. It also does not include an analog of the existence theorem in class field theory: the concept of class fields is absent in the Langlands correspondence. There are several other nonabelian theories, local and global, which provide alternatives to the Langlands correspondence point of view.

Another generalization of class field theory is anabelian geometry, which studies algorithms to restore the original object (e.g. a number field or a hyperbolic curve over it) from the knowledge of its full absolute Galois group or algebraic fundamental group.

Another natural generalization is higher class field theory, divided into &quot;higher local class field theory&quot; and &quot;higher global class field theory&quot;. It describes abelian extensions of higher local fields and higher global fields. The latter come as function fields of schemes of finite type over integers and their appropriate localizations and completions. It uses algebraic K-theory, and appropriate Milnor K-groups generalize the formula_10 used in one-dimensional class field theory.

<doc id="242698" wikidata="Q157367" url="?curid=242698" title="Brandenburg–Prussia">
<text>Brandenburg-Prussia (; ) is the historiographic denomination for the early modern realm of the Brandenburgian Royal dynasty of the House of Hohenzollern between 1618 and 1701. Based in the Electorate of Brandenburg, the main branch of the Hohenzollern intermarried with the branch ruling the Duchy of Prussia, and secured succession upon the latter&#x27;s extinction in the male line in 1618. 

Another consequence of the intermarriage between the nobility was the acquisition / incorporation of the lands far to the west of Brandenburg-Prussia located in western Germany of the Holy Roman Empire (A.D. c. 800 / 962 to 1806), and situated in the lower Rhenish / Rhine River of the principalities of the Duchy of Cleves, County of Mark and County of Ravensberg after the signing and agreements in the Treaty of Xanten in 1614.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) was especially devastating. The Elector changed sides three times, and as a result Protestant groups of Evangelical Lutheran / Reformed / Calvinist and opposing Roman Catholic armies swept the lands back and forth, killing, burning, seizing men and confiscating any food or useful supplies. It is estimated that upwards of half the population of Central Europe / Germany of the late Medieval / Middle Ages period were killed or dislocated. Berlin and the other major cities were in ruins, and recovery took decades. By the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648, Brandenburg also gained the Bishopric of Minden and Principality of Halberstadt, also the succession in the Farther Pomerania (incorporated in the Treaty of Stettin of 1653), and the Duchy of Magdeburg (incorporated later in 1680). With the Treaty of Bromberg (1657), these concluded during the Second Northern War (1655-1660), the electors were also freed of old Polish vassalage and loyalty by the Treaty of Cracow gaining more independence for the Duchy of Prussia and gained territories of Lauenburg–Bütow and Draheim. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679) expanded the province of Brandenburgian Pomerania to the lower Oder River.

The second half of the 17th century laid the basis for Prussia to become one of the great players in European politics. The emerging Brandenburg-Prussian military potential, based on the introduction of a standing army in 1653, was symbolized by the widely noted victories in the Battle of Warsaw in 1656 and Battle of Fehrbellin (1675) and by the Great Sleigh Drive (1678). Brandenburg-Prussia also established a Brandenburg Navy for on the nearby waters of the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Finland and passages west to the North Sea with access to the North Atlantic Ocean and additional German colonies were established along the Brandenburger Gold Coast and Arguin. Frederick William, known as &quot;The Great Elector&quot;, opened up his realm of Brandenburg-Prussia to large-scale immigration (&quot;&quot;Peuplierung&quot;) of mostly Protestant refugees from all across Europe (&quot;Exulanten&quot;&quot;), most notably Huguenot immigration from France following the Edict of Potsdam. Frederick William also started to centralize Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s administration and reduce the influence of the outlying landed estates.

In 1701, Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, succeeded in elevating his status to the title of &quot;King in Prussia&quot;. This was made possible by the Duchy of Prussia&#x27;s sovereign status outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, and approval by the Royal House of Habsburg in Vienna in Austria, and the Holy Roman Emperor and other European royals in the course of forming alliances for the War of the Spanish Succession and the Great Northern War. From 1701 onward, the Hohenzollern dynasty domains were referred to as the Kingdom of Prussia, or simply Prussia. Legally, the personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia continued until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806. However, by this time the emperor&#x27;s overlordship over the empire had become in recent decades of a &quot;figleaf&quot; legal fiction. Hence, after 1701, Brandenburg was &quot;de facto&quot; treated as part of the Prussian kingdom. Frederick and his successors continued to centralize and expand the state, transforming the personal union of politically diverse principalities typical for the Brandenburg-Prussian era into a system of provinces subordinate to the Stadtschloss, Berlin (Royal or Berlin Palace) in the capital city of Berlin.

==Establishment under John Sigismund (1618)==
The Margraviate of Brandenburg had been the seat of the main branch of the Hohenzollerns, who were prince-electors in the Holy Roman Empire, since 1415. In 1525, by the Treaty of Krakow, the Duchy of Prussia was created through partial secularization of the State of the Teutonic Order. It was a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland and was governed by Duke Albert of Prussia, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern. On behalf of her mother Elisabeth of the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern, Anna Marie of Brunswick-Lüneburg became Albert&#x27;s second wife in 1550, and bore him his successor Albert Frederick. In 1563, the Brandenburgian branch of the Hohenzollern was granted the right of succession by the Polish crown. Albert Frederick became duke of Prussia after Albert&#x27;s death in 1568. His mother died in the same year, and thereafter he showed signs of mental disorder. Because of the duke&#x27;s illness, Prussia was governed by Albert&#x27;s nephew George Frederick of Hohenzollern-Ansbach-Jägersdorf (1577–1603). In 1573, Albert Frederick married Marie Eleonore of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, with whom he had several daughters.

In 1594, Albert Frederick&#x27;s then 14-year-old daughter Anna married the son of Joachim Frederick of Hohenzollern-Brandenburg, John Sigismund. The marriage ensured the right of succession in the Prussian duchy as well as in Cleves. Upon George Frederick&#x27;s death in 1603, the regency of the Prussian duchy passed to Joachim Frederick. Also in 1603, the Treaty of Gera was concluded by the members of the House of Hohenzollern, ruling that their territories were not to be internally divided in the future.

The Electors of Brandenburg inherited the Duchy of Prussia upon Albert Frederick&#x27;s death in 1618, but the duchy continued to be held as a fief under the Polish Crown until 1656/7. Since John Sigismund had suffered a stroke in 1616 and as a consequence was severely handicapped physically as well as mentally, his wife Anna ruled the Duchy of Prussia in his name until John Sigismund died of a second stroke in 1619, aged 47.

==George William, 1619–1640==
From 1619 to 1640, George William was elector of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia. He strove, but proved unable to break the dominance of the Electorate of Saxony in the Upper Saxon Circle. The Brandenburg-Saxon antagonism rendered the defense of the circle ineffective, and it was subsequently overrun by Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. While George William had claimed neutrality before, the presence of Wallenstein&#x27;s army forced him to join the Catholic-Imperial camp in the Treaty of Königsberg (1627) and accept garrisons. When the Swedish Empire entered the war and advanced into Brandenburg, George William again claimed neutrality, yet Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden compelled George William to join Sweden as an ally by occupying substantial territory in Brandenburg-Prussia and concentrating an army before the town walls of Berlin. George William did not conclude an alliance, but granted Sweden transit rights, two fortresses and subsidies. Consequently, Roman Catholic armies repeatedly ravaged Brandenburg and other Hohenzollern lands.

==&quot;The Great Elector&quot;, Frederick William, 1640–1688==

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, George William was succeeded by Frederick William, born 1620, who became known as &quot;The Great Elector&quot; (&quot;Der Große Kurfürst&quot;). The character of the young elector had been stamped by his Calvinist nurturer Calcum, a long stay in the Dutch Republic during his grand tour, and the events of the war, of which a meeting with his uncle Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in Pomerania was among the most impressive.

===Conclusion of the Thirty Years&#x27; War===

Frederick William took over Brandenburg-Prussia in times of a political, economical and demographic crisis caused by the war. Upon his succession, the new elector retired the Brandenburgian army, but had an army raised again in 1643/44. Whether or not Frederick William concluded a truce and neutrality agreement with Sweden is disputed: while a relevant 1641 document exists, it was never ratified and has repeatedly been described as a falsification. However, it is not disputed that he established the growth of Brandenburg-Prussia.

At the time, the forces of the Swedish Empire dominated Northern Germany, and along with her ally France, Sweden became guarantee power of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Swedish aim of controlling the Baltic Sea by establishing dominions on the coastline (&quot;dominium maris baltici&quot;) thwarted Frederick William&#x27;s ambitions to gain control over the Oder estuary with Stettin (Szczecin) in Pomerania.

The Brandenburgian margraves had long sought to expand northwards, connecting land-locked Brandenburg to the Baltic Sea. The Treaty of Grimnitz (1529) guaranteed Brandenburgian succession in the Duchy of Pomerania upon the extinction of the local House of Pomerania, and would have come into effect by the death of Pomeranian duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637. By the Treaty of Stettin (1630) however, Bogislaw XIV had also effectively handed over control of the duchy to Sweden, who refused to give in to the Brandenburgian claim. The Peace of Westphalia settled for a partition of the duchy between Brandenburg and Sweden, who determined the exact border in the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Sweden retained the western part including the lower Oder (Swedish Pomerania), while Brandenburg gained the eastern part (Farther Pomerania). Frederick William was dissatisfied by this outcome, and the acquisition of the whole Duchy of Pomerania was to become one of the main goals of his foreign policy.

In the Peace of Westphalia, Frederick William was compensated for Western Pomerania with the secularized bishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden and the right of succession to the likewise secularized Archbishopric of Magdeburg. With Halberstadt, Brandenburg-Prussia also gained several smaller territories: the Lordship of Derenburg, the County of Regenstein, the Lordship of Klettenberg and the Lordship of Lohra. This was primarily due to French efforts to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg emperor by strengthening the Hohenzollern, and while Frederick William valued these territories lower than Western Pomerania, they became step-stones for the creation of a closed, dominant realm in Germany in the long run.

===Devastation===

Of all Brandenburg-Prussian territories, the Electorate of Brandenburg was among the most devastated at the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Already before the war, the population density and wealth in the electorate had been low compared to other territories of the empire, and the war had destroyed 60 towns, 48 castles and about 5,000 villages. An average of 50% of the population was dead, in some regions only 10% survived. The rural population, due to deaths and flight to the towns, had dropped from 300,000 before the war to 75,000 thereafter. In the important towns of Berlin-Cölln and Frankfurt an der Oder, the population drop was one third and two-thirds, respectively. Some of the territories gained after the war were likewise devastated: in Pomerania, only one third of the population survived, and Magdeburg, once among the wealthiest cities of the empire, was burned down with most of the population slain. Least hit were the Duchy of Prussia, which was only peripherally involved in the war, and Minden. In 1670, the Great Elector invited Jews expelled from Vienna to settle in Brandenburg.

Despite efforts to resettle the devastated territories, it took some of them until the mid-18th century to reach the pre-war population density.

===Cow War===
In June 1651, Frederick William broke the provisions of the Peace of Westphalia by invading Jülich-Berg, bordering his possessions in Cleves-Mark at the lower Rhine river. The Treaty of Xanten, which had ended the War of the Jülich succession between Brandenburg and the count palatines in 1614, had partitioned the once united Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg among the belligerents, and Jülich-Berg was since ruled by the Catholic counts of Palatinate-Neuburg. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg, disregarded a 1647 agreement with Frederick William which had favored the Protestants in the duchies, while Frederick William insisted that the agreement be upheld. Besides these religious motives, Frederick William&#x27;s invasion also aimed at territorial expansion.

The conflict had the potential to spark another international war since Wolfgang William wanted to have the still not demobilized army of Lorraine, which continued to operate in the region despite the Peace of Westphalia, to intervene on his side, and Frederick William sought support of the Dutch Republic. The latter however followed a policy of neutrality and refused to aid Frederick William&#x27;s campaign, which was furthermore opposed by the Imperial estates as well as the local ones. Politically isolated, Frederick William aborted the campaign after the Treaty of Cleves negotiated by Imperial mediators in October 1651. The underlying religious dispute was only solved in 1672. While military confrontations were avoided and the Brandenburg-Prussian army was primarily occupied with stealing cattle (hence the name), it considerably lowered Frederick William&#x27;s reputation.

===Standing Army===

Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was convinced that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a &quot;landtag&quot; decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (&quot;Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit&quot;) and the upholding of serfdom (&quot;Leibeigenschaft&quot;, &quot;Bauernlegen&quot;).

Initially, the estates&#x27; contributions were limited to six years, yet Frederick William obliged the estates to continue the payments thereafter and created a dedicated office to collect the contributions. The contributions were confirmed by the estates in 1662, but transformed in 1666 by decree from a real estate tax to an excise tax. Since 1657, the towns had to contribute not soldiers, but monetary payments to the army, and since 1665, the estates were able to free themselves from contributing soldiers by additional payments. The initial army size of 8,000 men had risen to 25,000 to 30,000 men by 1688. By then, Frederick William had also accomplished his second goal, to finance the army independently of the estates. By 1688, these military costs amounted to considerable 1,500,000 talers or half of the state budget. Ensuring a solid financial basis for the army, undisturbed by the estates, was the foremost objective of Frederick William&#x27;s administrative reforms. He regarded military success as the only way to gain international reputation.

===Second Northern War===

The Swedish invasion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the following year started the Second Northern War. Frederick William offered protection to the Royal Prussian towns in the Treaty of Rinsk, but had to yield Swedish military supremacy and withdraw to his Prussian duchy. Pursued by Swedish forces to the Prussian capital, Frederick William made peace and allied with Sweden, taking the Duchy of Prussia and Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) as fiefs from Charles X Gustav of Sweden in the Treaty of Königsberg in January 1656. The alliance proved victorious in the Battle of Warsaw in June, enhancing the elector&#x27;s international reputation. Continued pressure on Charles X Gustav resulted in him conceding full sovereignty in Ducal Prussia and Ermland to Frederick William by the Treaty of Labiau in November to ensure the maintenance of the alliance. The Treaty of Radnot, concluded in December by Sweden and her allies, further awarded Greater Poland to Brandenburg-Prussia in case of a victory.

When the anti-Swedish coalition however gained the upper hand, Frederick William changed sides when Polish king John II Casimir Vasa confirmed his sovereignty in Prussia, but not in Ermland, in the Treaty of Wehlau-Bromberg in 1657. The duchy would legally revert to Poland if the Hohenzollern dynastic line became extinct. Hohenzollern sovereignty in the Prussian duchy was confirmed in the Peace of Oliva, which ended the war in 1660. Brandenburg-Prussian campaigns in Swedish Pomerania did not result in permanent gains.

===Dutch and Scanian Wars===
In 1672, the Franco-Dutch War broke out, with Brandenburg-Prussia involved as an ally of the Dutch Republic. This alliance was based on a treaty of 1669, and resulted in French occupation of Brandenburg-Prussian Cleves. In June 1673, Frederick William abandoned the Dutch alliance and concluded a subsidy treaty with France, who in return withdrew from Cleves. When the Holy Roman Empire declared war on France, a so-called &quot;Reichskrieg&quot;, Brandenburg-Prussia again changed sides and joined the imperial forces. France pressured her ally Sweden to relieve her by attacking Brandenburg-Prussia from the north. Charles XI of Sweden, dependent on French subsidies, reluctantly occupied the Brandenburgian Uckermark in 1674, starting the German theater of the Scanian War (Brandenburg-Swedish War). Frederick William reacted promptly by marching his armies from the Rhine to northern Brandenburg, and encountered the rear of the Swedish army, which was in the process of crossing a swamp, in the Battle of Fehrbellin (1675). Though a minor skirmish from a military perspective, Frederick William&#x27;s victory turned out to be of huge symbolic significance. The &quot;Great Elector&quot; started a counter-offensive, pursuing the retreating Swedish forces through Swedish Pomerania.

Polish king John III Sobieski planned to restore Polish suzerainty over the Duchy of Prussia, and for this purpose concluded an alliance with France on 11 June 1675. France promised assistance and subsidies, while Sobieski in turn allowed French recruitment in Poland-Lithuania and promised to aid Hungarian rebel forces who were to distract the Habsburgs from their war against France. For this plan to work out, Poland-Lithuania had to first conclude her war against the Ottoman Empire, which French diplomacy despite great efforts failed to achieve. Furthermore, Sobieski was opposed by the Papacy, by Polish gentry who saw the Ottomans as the greater threat, and by Polish magnates bribed by Berlin and Vienna. Inner-Polish Catholic opposition to an intervention on the Protestant Hungarian rebels&#x27; side added to the resentments. Thus, while Treaty of Żurawno ended the Polish-Ottoman war in 1676, Sobieski sided with the emperor instead, and the plan for a Prussian campaign was dropped.

By 1678, Frederick William had cleared Swedish Pomerania and occupied most of it, with the exception of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in what became known as the Great Sleigh Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish ally, and forced Frederick William to basically return to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania, the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.

==Frederick III (I), 1688–1713==
Frederick III of Brandenburg, since 1701 also Frederick I of Prussia, was born in Königsberg in 1657. Already in the last years of the reign of his father, the friendly relations with France established after Saint Germain (1679) had cooled, not least because of the Huguenot question. In 1686, Frederick William turned toward the Habsburg emperor, with whom he concluded an alliance on 22 December 1686. For this alliance, Frederick William relinquished rights on Silesia in favor of the Habsburgs, and in turn received the Silesian County of Schwiebus which bordered the Neumark. Frederick III, present at the negotiations as crown prince, assured the Habsburgs of the continuation of the alliance once he was in power, and secretly concluded an amendment to return Schwiebus to the Habsburgs, which he eventually did in 1694. Throughout his reign, Brandenburg-Prussia remained a Habsburg ally and repeatedly deployed troops to fight against France. In 1693, Frederick III began to sound out the possibility of an elevation of his status at the Habsburg court in Vienna, and while the first attempt was unsuccessful, elevation to a king remained the central goal on his agenda.

The envisioned status elevation did not merely serve a decorative purpose, but was regarded a necessity to prevail in political competition. Though Frederick III held the elevated status of a prince elector, this status was also gained by Maximilian I of Bavaria in 1623, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, also by the Elector of the Palatinate in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), and by Ernest Augustus of the House of Hanover in 1692. Thus, the formerly exclusive club of the prince-electors now had nine members, six of whom were secular princes, and further changes seemed possible. Within the circle of prince-electors, August the Strong, Elector of Saxony, had secured the Polish crown in 1697, and the House of Hanover had secured succession of the British throne. From Frederick III&#x27;s perspective, stagnation in status meant loss of power, and this perspective seemed to be confirmed when the European royals ignored Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s claims in the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697).

Frederick decided to raise the Duchy of Prussia to a kingdom. Within the Holy Roman Empire, no one could call himself king except the emperor and the king of Bohemia. However, Prussia was outside the empire, and the Hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it. The practicability of this plan was doubted by some of his advisors, and in any case the crown was only valuable if recognized by the European nobility, most important the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1699, negotiations were renewed with emperor Leopold I, who in turn was in need of allies since the War of the Spanish Succession was about to break out. On 16 November 1700, the emperor approved Frederick&#x27;s coronation in the Crown Treaty. With respect to Poland-Lithuania, who held the provinces of Royal Prussia and Ermland, it was agreed that Frederick would call himself King in Prussia, instead of King &quot;of&quot; Prussia. Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, for similar reasons as the emperor, accepted Frederick&#x27;s elevation prior to the coronation.

On 17 January 1701, Frederick dedicated the royal coat of arms, the Prussian black eagle, and motto, &quot;suum cuique&quot;. On 18 January, he crowned himself and his wife Sophie Charlotte in a baroque ceremony in Königsberg Castle.

On 28 January, Augustus the Strong congratulated Frederick, yet not as Polish king, but as Saxon elector. In February, Denmark–Norway accepted Frederick&#x27;s elevation in hope of an ally in the Great Northern War, and the Tsardom of Russia likewise approved in 1701. Most princes of the Holy Roman Empire followed. Charles XII of Sweden accepted Frederick as Prussian king in 1703. In 1713, France and Spain also accepted Frederick&#x27;s royal status.

The coronation was not accepted by the Teutonic Order, who despite the secularization of the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 upheld claims to the region. The Grand Master protested at the emperor&#x27;s court, and the pope sent a circular to all Catholic regents to not accept Frederick&#x27;s royal status. Until 1787, papal documents continued to speak of the Prussian kings as &quot;Margraves of Brandenburg&quot;. Neither did the Polish–Lithuanian nobility accept Frederick&#x27;s royal status, seeing the Polish province of Royal Prussia endangered, and only in 1764 was the Prussian kingship accepted.

Since Brandenburg was still legally part of the Holy Roman Empire, the personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia technically continued until the empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806. However, the emperor&#x27;s power was only nominal by this time, and Brandenburg soon came to be treated as a &quot;de facto&quot; province of the Prussian kingdom. Although Frederick was still only an elector within the portions of his domain that were part of the empire, he only acknowledged the emperor&#x27;s overlordship over them in a formal way.

==Administration==

In the mid-16th century, the margraves of Brandenburg had become highly dependent on the estates (counts, lords, knights and towns, no prelates due to the Protestant Reformation in 1538). The margraviate&#x27;s liabilities and tax income as well as the margrave&#x27;s finances were controlled by the &quot;Kreditwerk&quot;, an institution not controlled by the elector, and the &quot;Großer Ausschuß&quot; (&quot;Great Committee&quot;) of the estates. This was due to concessions made by Joachim II in 1541 in turn for financial aid by the estates, however, the &quot;Kreditwerk&quot; went bankrupt between 1618 and 1625. The margraves further had to yield the veto of the estates in all issues concerning the &quot;better or worse of the country&quot;, in all legal commitments, and in all issues concerning pawn or sale of the elector&#x27;s real property.

To reduce the influence of the estates, Joachim Frederick in 1604 created a council called &quot;Geheimer Rat für die Kurmark&quot; (&quot;Privy Council for the Electorate&quot;), which instead of the estates was to function as the supreme advisory council for the elector. While the council was permanently established in 1613, it failed to gain any influence until 1651 due to the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Until after the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the territories of Brandenburg-Prussia were politically independent from each other, connected only by the common feudal superior. Frederick William, who envisioned the transformation of the personal union into a real union, started to centralize the Brandenburg-Prussian government with an attempt to establish the &quot;Geheimer Rat&quot; as a central authority for all territories in 1651, but this project proved to be unfeasible. Instead, the elector continued to appoint a governor (&quot;Kurfürstlicher Rat&quot;) for each territory, who in most cases was a member of the &quot;Geheimer Rat&quot;. The most powerful institution in the territories remained the governments of the estates (&quot;Landständische Regierung&quot;, named &quot;Oberratsstube&quot; in Prussia and &quot;Geheime Landesregierung&quot; in Mark and Cleves), which were the highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction, finances and administration. The elector attempted to balance the estates&#x27; governments by creating &quot;Amtskammer&quot; chambers to administer and coordinate the elector&#x27;s domains, tax income and privileges. Such chambers were introduced in Brandenburg in 1652, in Cleves and Mark in 1653, in Pomerania in 1654, in Prussia in 1661 and in Magdeburg in 1680. Also in 1680, the &quot;Kreditwerk&quot; came under the aegis of the elector.

Frederick William&#x27;s excise tax (&quot;Akzise&quot;), which since 1667 replaced the property tax raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s standing army with the estates&#x27; consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges were not to be used to interfere with the exertion of the elector&#x27;s sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an &quot;Akzise&quot; was raised with the estates&#x27; consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates for the first time in 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector&#x27;s taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an &quot;Akzise&quot; to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an &quot;Akzise&quot; was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William&#x27;s reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.

Under the rule of Frederick III (I), the Brandenburg Prussian territories were de facto reduced to provinces of the monarchy. Frederick William&#x27;s testament would have divided Brandenburg-Prussia among his sons, yet firstborn Frederick III with the emperor&#x27;s backing succeeded in becoming the sole ruler based on the Treaty of Gera, which forbade a division of Hohenzollern territories. In 1689, a new central chamber for all Brandenburg-Prussian territories was created, called &quot;Geheime Hofkammer&quot; (since 1713: &quot;Generalfinanzdirektorium&quot;). This chamber functioned as a superior agency of the territories&#x27; &quot;Amtskammer&quot; chambers. The General War Commissariat (&quot;Generalkriegskommissariat&quot;) emerged as a second central agency, superior to the local &quot;Kriegskommissariat&quot; agencies initially concerned with the administration of the army, but until 1712 transformed into an agency also concerned with general tax and police tasks.

===List of territories===

==Religion and immigration==
In 1613, John Sigismund converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism, but failed to achieve the conversion of the estates by the rule of cuius regio, eius religio. Thus, on 5 February 1615, he granted the Lutherans religious freedom, while the Elector&#x27;s court remained largely Calvinist. When Frederick William I rebuilt Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s war-torn economy, he attracted settlers from all Europe, especially by offering religious asylum, most prominently by the Edict of Potsdam which attracted more than 15,000 Huguenots.

==Navy and colonies==

Brandenburg-Prussia established a navy and colonies during the reign of Frederick William. The &quot;Great Elector&quot; had spent part of his childhood at the Pomeranian court and port cities of Wolgast (1631–1633) and Stettin (1633–1635), and afterwards studied at the Dutch universities of Leyden and The Hague (1635–1638). When Frederick William became elector in 1640, he invited Dutch engineers to Brandenburg, sent Brandenburgian engineers to study in the Netherlands, and in 1646 married educated Luise Henriette of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Frederick William tried to acquire finances to rebuild the country by participating in oversea trade, and attempted to found a Brandenburg-Prussian East Indies Company. He engaged former Dutch admiral Aernoult Gijsels van Lier as advisor and tried to persuade the Holy Roman Emperor and princes of the empire to participate. The emperor, however, declined the request as he considered it dangerous to disturb the interest of the other European powers. In 1651, Frederick William bought Danish Fort Dansborg and Tranquebar for 120,000 reichstalers. As Frederick William was unable to raise this sum, he asked several people and Hanseatic towns to invest in the project, but since none of these were able or willing to give sufficient money, the treaty with Denmark was nullified in 1653.

===Navy===


In 1675, after the victory at Fehrbellin and the Brandenburg-Prussian advance in Swedish Pomerania during the Scanian War, Frederick William decided to establish a navy. He engaged Dutch merchant and shipowner Benjamin Raule as his advisor, who after a first personal meeting with Frederick William in 1675 settled in Brandenburg in 1676 and became the major figure of Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s emerging naval and colonial enterprise. The Brandenburg-Prussian navy was established from ten ships which Frederick William leased from Raule, and achieved first successes in the war against Sweden supporting the siege of Stralsund and Stettin and the invasion of Rügen. In Pillau (now Baltiysk) on the East Prussian coast, Raule established shipyards and enlarged the port facilities.

After the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), the navy was used to hijack Swedish ships in the Baltic Sea, and in 1680, six Brandenburg-Prussian vessels captured the Spanish vessel &quot;Carolus Secundus&quot; near Ostend to pressure Spain to pay promised subsidies. The Spanish ship was renamed &quot;Markgraf von Brandenburg&quot; (&quot;Margrave of Brandenburg&quot;) and became the flagship of an Atlantic fleet that was ordered to capture Spanish vessels carrying silver; it was not successful in this mission. In the following years, the navy was expanded, and the policy of leasing ships was replaced by the policy of building or purchasing them. On 1 October 1684 Frederick William bought all ships that had been leased for 110,000 talers. Also in 1684, the East Frisian port of Emden replaced Pillau as the main Brandenburg-Prussian naval base. From Pillau, part of the shipyard, the admiral&#x27;s house and the wooden church of the employees was transferred to Emden. While Emden was not part of Brandenburg-Prussia, the elector owned a nearby castle, Greetsiel, and negotiated an agreement with the town to maintain a garrison and a port.

===West African Gold Coast (Großfriedrichsburg)===

In 1679, Raule presented Frederick William a plan to establish colonies in African Guinea, and the elector approved. In July 1680, Frederick William issued respective orders, and two ships were selected to establish trade contacts with African tribes and explore places where colonies could be established. On 17 September, frigate &quot;Wappen von Brandenburg&quot; (&quot;Seal of Brandenburg&quot;) and &quot;Morian&quot; (poetic for &quot;Mohr&quot;, &quot;Negro&quot;) left for Guinea. The ships reached Guinea in January 1681. Since the crew of the &quot;Wappen von Brandenburg&quot; sold a barrel of brandy to Africans in a territory claimed by the Dutch West Indies Company, the latter confiscated the ship in March. The crew of the remaining ship &quot;Morian&quot; managed to have three Guinean chieftains sign a contract on 16 May, before the Dutch expelled the vessel from the coastal waters. This treaty, officially declared as trade agreement, included a clause of subjection of the chiefs to Frederick William&#x27;s overlordship and an agreement allowing Brandenburg-Prussia to establish a fort, and is thus regarded the beginning of the Brandenburg-Prussian colonial era.

To facilitate the colonial expeditions, the Brandenburg African Company was founded on 7 March 1682, initially with its headquarters in Berlin and its shipyards in Pillau, since 1683 in Emden. Throughout its existence, the company was underfunded, and expeditions were financed also by private capital, including payments by Raule and Frederick William. In July 1682, an expedition under East Prussian Otto Friedrich von der Groeben was sent to Guinea to erect the fortress Großfriedrichsburg. On 24 February 1684, another treaty with indigenous chiefs was signed that allowed the erection of a second fort in nearby Accada (now Akwida), named Dorotheenschanze after Frederick William&#x27;s second wife. On 4 February 1685, a treaty was signed with the chiefs of Taccararay (now Takoradi), some 30 kilometers east of Großfriedrichsburg. A fourth fort was built at a spring near the village of Taccrama, between Großfriedrichsburg and Dorotheenschanze, named &quot;Loge&quot; or &quot;Sophie-Louise-Schanze&quot;. Overall, the colony comprised roughly 50 kilometers of coastline, and did not extend into the hinterland.

===Arguin===

A second colony was established at the Arguin archipelago off the West African coast (now part of Mauritania). In contrast to the Guinean colony, Arguin had been a colony before: In 1520, Portugal had built a fort on the main island, which with all of Portugal came under Spanish control in 1580. In 1638 it was conquered by the Dutch Republic, and in 1678 by France, who due to high maintenance costs abandoned it and demolished the fort soon after. On 27 July 1685, an expedition was mounted by Frederick William and Raule, who took possession of the vacated colony on 1 October. Subsequently, the fort was rebuilt and contacts to the indigenous population established. France was alarmed and sent a vessel to re-conquer the fort in late 1687, but the attack of a French frigate and a smaller vessel was beaten back by the Brandenburg-Prussian garrison. The victory improved the relations to the indigenous people, many of whom were carried off as slaves by the French before. While Arguin did not reach the economic importance of Großfriedrichsburg, it temporarily advanced to the world&#x27;s primary staple port for slaves.

===Caribbean===

The African colonies enabled Brandenburg-Prussia to participate in the Triangular trade, yet it lacked its own trading post in the Caribbean Sea. In 1684, Brandenburg-Prussia was denied the purchase of the French islands Sainte Croix and Saint Vincent. In November 1685, after a failed attempt to purchase Saint Thomas from Denmark–Norway, a Brandenburg-Danish agreement was reached that allowed the Brandenburg African Company to rent part of Saint Thomas as a base for 30 years, while the sovereignty remained with Denmark and administration with the Danish West Indies and Guinean Company. The first Brandenburgian vessel arrived in 1686 with 450 slaves from Großfriedrichsburg. Brandenburg-Prussia was allotted an area near the capital city Charlotte Amalie, called &quot;Brandenburgery&quot;, and other territories named &quot;Krum Bay&quot; and &quot;Bordeaux Estates&quot; further west. In 1688, 300 Europeans and several hundred slaves lived on the Brandenburgian estates. In November 1695, French forces looted the Brandenburgian (not the Danish) colony. In 1731, the Brandenburg-Prussian company on Saint Thomas (BAAC) became insolvent, and abandoned the island in 1735. Their last remains were sold by auction in 1738.

Brandenburg-Prussia tried to claim Crab Island in 1687, but the island was also claimed by other European powers beforehand, and when a second expedition in 1692 found the island under Danish control, the plan was abandoned. In 1689, Brandenburg-Prussia claimed Peter Island, but the small rock proved unsuitable for trade or settlement. In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland later abandoned the territory and thus was no longer present on the island, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with the English government which had interests in Tobago did not result in an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia attempted to acquire Tortola from England via diplomacy, but the negotiations went nowhere, and were eventually called off. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.

<text>The Kingdom of Prussia (, ) constituted the German state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1866 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Its capital was Berlin.

The kings of Prussia were from the House of Hohenzollern. The polity of Brandenburg-Prussia, predecessor of the kingdom, became a military power under Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, known as &quot;The Great Elector&quot;. As a kingdom, Prussia continued its rise to power, especially during the reign of Frederick II &quot;the Great&quot;. Frederick the Great was instrumental in starting the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), holding his own against Austria, Russia, France and Sweden and establishing Prussia&#x27;s dominant role among the German states, as well as establishing the country as a European great power through the victories of the powerful Prussian Army. Prussia made attempts to unify all the German states (excluding the German cantons in Switzerland) under its rule, and whether Austria would be included in such a unified German domain became an ongoing question. After the Napoleonic Wars led to the creation of the German Confederation, the issue of unifying the German states caused the German revolutions of 1848–1849, with representatives from all states attempting to unify under their own constitution. Attempts to create a federation remained unsuccessful and the German Confederation collapsed in 1866 when the Austro-Prussian War ensued between its two most powerful member states.

Prussia was subsequently the driving force behind establishing in 1866 the North German Confederation, transformed in 1871 into the unified German Empire and considered the earliest continual legal predecessor of today&#x27;s Federal Republic of Germany. The North German Confederation was seen as more of an alliance of military strength in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War but many of its laws were later used in the German Empire. The German Empire successfully unified all of the German states aside from Austria and Switzerland under Prussian hegemony due to the defeat of Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. The war united all the German states against a common enemy, and with the victory came an overwhelming wave of nationalism which changed the opinions of some of those who had been against unification.

With the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Kingdom of Prussia was transformed into the Free State of Prussia. Prussia as a whole was abolished in 1947.

== History ==
===Background and establishment===
The Hohenzollerns were made rulers of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1518. In 1529, the Hohenzollerns secured the reversion of the Duchy of Pomerania after a series of conflicts, and acquired its eastern part following the Peace of Westphalia.

In 1618, the electors of Brandenburg also inherited the Duchy of Prussia, since 1511 ruled by a younger branch of the House of Hohenzollern. In 1525, Albrecht of Brandenburg, the last grand master of the Teutonic Order, secularized his territory and converted it into a duchy. It was ruled in a personal union with Brandenburg, known as &quot;Brandenburg-Prussia&quot;. A full union was not possible, since Brandenburg was still legally part of the Holy Roman Empire and the Duchy of Prussia was a fief of Poland. The Teutonic Order had paid homage to Poland since 1466, and the Hohenzollerns continued to pay homage after secularizing Ducal Prussia.

In the course of the Second Northern War, the treaties of Labiau and Wehlau-Bromberg granted the Hohenzollerns full sovereignty over the Prussian duchy by September 1657.

In return for an alliance against France in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great Elector&#x27;s son, Frederick III, was allowed to elevate Prussia to a kingdom in the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700. Frederick crowned himself &quot;King in Prussia&quot; as Frederick I on 18 January 1701. Legally, no kingdoms could exist in the Holy Roman Empire except for Bohemia and Italy. However, Frederick took the line that since Prussia had never been part of the empire and the Hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it, he could elevate Prussia to a kingdom. Emperor Leopold I, keen to secure Frederick&#x27;s support in the impending War of the Spanish Succession, acquiesced.

The style &quot;King &quot;in&quot; Prussia&quot; was adopted to acknowledge the legal fiction that the Hohenzollerns were legally kings only in their former duchy. In Brandenburg and the portions of their domains that were within the Empire, they were still legally only electors under the overlordship of the emperor. However, by this time the emperor&#x27;s authority was only nominal. The rulers of the empire&#x27;s various territories acted largely as the rulers of sovereign states, and only acknowledged the emperor&#x27;s suzerainty in a formal way. In addition, the duchy was only the eastern bulk of the region of Prussia; the westernmost fragment constituted the part of Royal Prussia east of Vistula, held along with the title &quot;King of Prussia&quot; by the King of Poland. While the personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia legally continued until the end of the empire in 1806, from 1701 onward, Brandenburg was &quot;de facto&quot; treated as an integral part of the kingdom. Since the Hohenzollerns were nominally still subjects of the emperor within the parts of their domains that were part of the empire, they continued to use the additional title of Elector of Brandenburg until the empire was dissolved. It was not until 1772 that the title &quot;King &quot;of&quot; Prussia&quot; was adopted, following the acquisition of Royal Prussia in the First Partition of Poland.

=== 1701–1721: Plague and the Great Northern War ===
The Kingdom of Prussia was still recovering from the devastation of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and poor in natural resources. Its territory was disjointed, stretching from the lands of the Duchy of Prussia on the south-east coast of the Baltic Sea to the Hohenzollern heartland of Brandenburg, with the exclaves of Cleves, Mark and Ravensberg in the Rhineland. In 1708 about one third of the population of East Prussia died during the Great Northern War plague outbreak. The bubonic plague reached Prenzlau in August 1710 but receded before it could reach the capital Berlin, which was only away.

The Great Northern War was the first major conflict in which the Kingdom of Prussia was involved. Starting in 1700, the war involved a coalition led by Tsarist Russia against the dominant North European power at the time, the Swedish Empire. Crown Prince Frederick William tried in 1705 to get Prussia involved in the war, stating &quot;best Prussia has her own army and makes her own decisions.&quot; His views, however, were not considered acceptable by his father, and was not until 1713 that Frederick William ascended to the throne. Therefore, in 1715, Prussia, led by Frederick William, joined the coalition for various reasons, including the danger of being attacked from both her rear and the sea; her claims on Pomerania; and the fact that if she stood aside and Sweden lost, she would not get a share of the territory. Prussia only participated in one battle, the Battle of Stresow on the island of Rügen, as the war had already been practically decided in the 1709 Battle of Poltava. In the Treaty of Stockholm Prussia gained all of Swedish Pomerania east of the River Oder. Sweden would however keep a portion of Pomerania until 1815. The Great Northern War not only marked the end of the Swedish Empire but also elevated Prussia and Russia at the expense of the declining Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as new powers in Europe.

The Great Elector had incorporated the Junkers, the landed aristocracy, into the kingdom&#x27;s bureaucracy and military machine, giving them a vested interest in the Prussian Army and compulsory education. King Frederick William I inaugurated the Prussian compulsory conscription system in 1717.

=== 1740–1762: Silesian Wars ===

In 1740, King Frederick II (Frederick the Great) came to the throne. Using the pretext of a 1537 treaty (vetoed by Emperor Ferdinand I) by which parts of Silesia were to pass to Brandenburg after the extinction of its ruling Piast dynasty, Frederick invaded Silesia, thereby beginning the War of the Austrian Succession. After rapidly occupying Silesia, Frederick offered to protect Queen Maria Theresa if the province were turned over to him. The offer was rejected, but Austria faced several other opponents in a desperate struggle for survival, and Frederick was eventually able to gain formal cession with the Treaty of Berlin in 1742.

To the surprise of many, Austria managed to renew the war successfully. In 1744 Frederick invaded again to forestall reprisals and to claim, this time, the Kingdom of Bohemia. He failed, but French pressure on Austria&#x27;s ally Great Britain led to a series of treaties and compromises, culminating in the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle that restored peace and left Prussia in possession of most of Silesia.

Humiliated by the cession of Silesia, Austria worked to secure an alliance with France and Russia (the &quot;Diplomatic Revolution&quot;), while Prussia drifted into Great Britain&#x27;s camp forming the Anglo-Prussian Alliance. When Frederick preemptively invaded Saxony and Bohemia over the course of a few months in 1756–1757, he began a Third Silesian War and initiated the Seven Years&#x27; War.

This war was a desperate struggle for the Prussian Army, and the fact that it managed to fight much of Europe to a draw bears witness to Frederick&#x27;s military skills. Facing Austria, Russia, France, and Sweden simultaneously, and with only Hanover (and the non-continental British) as notable allies, Frederick managed to prevent a serious invasion until October 1760, when the Russian army briefly occupied Berlin and Königsberg. The situation became progressively grimmer, however, until the death in 1762 of Empress Elizabeth of Russia (Miracle of the House of Brandenburg). The accession of the Prussophile Peter III relieved the pressure on the eastern front. Sweden also exited the war at about the same time.

Defeating the Austrian army at the Battle of Burkersdorf and relying on continuing British success against France in the war&#x27;s colonial theatres, Prussia was finally able to force a &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; on the continent. This result confirmed Prussia&#x27;s major role within the German states and established the country as a European great power. Frederick, appalled by the near-defeat of Prussia and the economic devastation of his kingdom, lived out his days as a much more peaceable ruler.

Other additions to Prussia in the 18th century were the County of East Frisia (1744), the Principality of Bayreuth (1791) and Principality of Ansbach (1791), the latter two being acquired through purchase from branches of the Hohenzollern dynasty.

=== 1772, 1793, and 1795: Partitions of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ===

To the east and south of Prussia, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had gradually weakened during the 18th century. Alarmed by increasing Russian influences in Polish affairs and by a possible expansion of the Russian Empire, Frederick was instrumental in initiating the first of the Partitions of Poland between Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1772 to maintain a balance of power. The Kingdom of Prussia annexed most of the Polish province of Royal Prussia, including Warmia, allowing Frederick to finally adopt the title King &quot;of&quot; Prussia; the annexed Royal Prussian land was organised the following year into the Province of West Prussia; most of the rest became the originally separate Netze District, which was attached to West Prussia in 1775. The boundary between West Prussia and the territory previously known as the Duchy of Prussia, now the Province of East Prussia was also adjusted, transferring Marienwerder to West Prussia (which became its capital) and Warmia (the Heilsberg and districts) to East Prussia. The annexed territory connected East Prussia with the Province of Pomerania, uniting the kingdom&#x27;s eastern territories.

After Frederick died in 1786, his nephew Fredrick William II continued the partitions, gaining a large part of western Poland in 1793; Thorn (Toruń) and Danzig (Gdańsk), which had remained part of Poland after the first partition, were incorporated into West Prussia, while the remainder became the province of South Prussia.

In 1787, Prussia invaded Holland to restore the Orangist stadtholderate against the increasingly rebellious Patriots, who sought to overthrow the House of Orange-Nassau and establish a democratic republic. The direct cause of the invasion was the arrest at Goejanverwellesluis, where Frederick William II&#x27;s sister Wilhelmina of Prussia, also stadtholder William V of Orange&#x27;s wife, was stopped by a band of Patriots who denied her passage to The Hague to reclaim her husband&#x27;s position.

In 1795, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist and a large area (including Warsaw) to the south and east of East Prussia became part of Prussia. Most of the new territories (and the part of South Prussia north of the Vistula) were organised into the province of New East Prussia; South Prussia gained the area immediately south of the Vistula, Narew and Bug, including Warsaw; a small area to the south of South Prussia became New Silesia. With the Polish-Lithuanian state gone Prussia now shared its eastern borders with the Habsburg monarchy (West Galicia) and Russia (Russian partition).

The Partitions were facilitated by the fact that they occurred just before the 19th-century rise of nationalism in Europe, and the national self-awareness was yet to be developed in most European peoples, especially among commoners. The Kingdom of Prussia was perceived in Poland more as a nationality-neutral personal holding of the ruling House of Hohenzollern, rather than a German nation-state, and any anxiety concerned predominantly freedom to practice religion rather than rights to maintain national identity. The onset of Germanisation in the following decades, later joined by the , quickly changed this benign picture and alienated Poles from the Prussian state, ultimately boosting their national self-awareness and eliciting their national resistance against Prussian rule.

=== 1801–1815: Napoleonic Wars ===

Following the French Revolution and the Execution of Louis XVI, Prussia declared war on the French First Republic. When Prussian troops attempted to invade France, they were beaten back and the Treaty of Basel (1795) ended the War of the First Coalition. In it, the First French Republic and Prussia had stipulated that the latter would ensure the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s neutrality in all the latter&#x27;s territories north of the demarcation line of the River Main, including the British continental dominions of the Electorate of Hanover and the Duchies of Bremen-Verden. To this end, Hanover (including Bremen-Verden) also had to provide troops for the so-called &quot;demarcation army&quot; maintaining this state of &quot;armed neutrality&quot;.

In the course of the War of the Second Coalition against France (1799–1802), Napoleon Bonaparte urged Prussia to occupy Hanover. In 1801, 24,000 Prussian soldiers invaded, surprising Hanover, which surrendered without a fight. In April 1801 the Prussian troops arrived in Bremen-Verden&#x27;s capital Stade and stayed there until October that year. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland first ignored Prussia&#x27;s hostility, but when it joined the pro-French Second League of Armed Neutrality alongside Denmark–Norway and Russia, Britain started to capture Prussian sea vessels. After the Battle of Copenhagen the coalition fell apart and Prussia again withdrew its troops.

At Napoleon&#x27;s instigation, Prussia recaptured British Hanover and Bremen-Verden in early 1806. On 6 August that year the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved as a result of Napoleon&#x27;s victories over Austria. The title of (Prince-elector) of Brandenburg became meaningless, and was dropped. Nonetheless, King Frederick William III was now &quot;de jure&quot; as well as &quot;de facto&quot; sovereign of all of the Hohenzollern domains. Before this time, the Hohenzollern sovereign had held many titles and crowns, from Supreme Governor of the Protestant Churches (&quot;summus episcopus&quot;) to King, Elector, Grand Duke, Duke for the various regions and realms under his rule. After 1806 he was simply King of Prussia and &quot;summus episcopus&quot;.
But when Prussia, after it turned against the First French Empire, was defeated in the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt (14 October 1806), Frederick William III was forced to temporarily flee to remote Memel. After the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, Prussia lost about half of its territory, including the land gained from the Second and Third Partitions of Poland (which now fell to the Duchy of Warsaw) and all land west of the Elbe river. France recaptured Prussian-occupied Hanover, including Bremen-Verden. The remainder of the kingdom was occupied by French troops (at Prussia&#x27;s expense) and the king was obliged to make an alliance with France and join the Continental System.

The Prussian reforms were a reaction to the Prussian defeat in 1806 and the Treaties of Tilsit. It describes a series of constitutional, administrative, social and economic reforms of the kingdom of Prussia. They are sometimes known as the &quot;Stein-Hardenberg Reforms&quot; after Karl Freiherr vom Stein and Karl August Fürst von Hardenberg, their main instigators.

After the defeat of Napoleon in Russia in 1812, Prussia quit the alliance and took part in the Sixth Coalition during the &quot;Wars of Liberation&quot; () against the French occupation. Prussian troops under Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher contributed crucially in the Battle of Waterloo of 1815 to the final victory over Napoleon.

===1815: After Napoleon===

Prussia&#x27;s reward for its part in France&#x27;s defeat came at the Congress of Vienna. It regained most of its pre-1806 territory. Notable exceptions included part of the territory annexed in the Second and Third Partitions of Poland, which became Congress Poland under Russian rule (though it did retain Danzig, acquired in the Second Partition). It also did not regain several of its former towns in the south. However, as compensation it picked up some new territory, including 40% of the Kingdom of Saxony and much of Westphalia and the Rhineland. Prussia now stretched uninterrupted from the Niemen in the east to the Elbe in the west, and possessed a chain of disconnected territories west of the Elbe. This left Prussia as the only great power with a predominantly German-speaking population.

With these gains in territory, the kingdom was reorganized into 10 provinces. Most of the kingdom, aside from the provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, and the autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen but including the formerly Polish Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the Draheim territory, became part of the new German Confederation, a confederacy of 39 sovereign states (including Austria and Bohemia) replacing the defunct Holy Roman Empire.

Frederick William III submitted Prussia to a number of administrative reforms, among others reorganising the government by way of ministries, which remained formative for the following hundred years.

As to religion, reformed Calvinist Frederick William III—as &quot;Supreme Governor of the Protestant Churches&quot;—asserted his long-cherished project (started in 1798) to unite the Lutheran and the Reformed Church in 1817, (see Prussian Union). The Calvinist minority, strongly supported by its co-religionist Frederick William III, and the partially reluctant Lutheran majority formed the united Protestant Evangelical Church in Prussia. However, ensuing quarrels causing a permanent schism among the Lutherans into united and Old Lutherans by 1830.

As a consequence of the Revolutions of 1848, the Principalities of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Hohenzollern-Hechingen (ruled by a Catholic cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern) were annexed by Prussia in 1850, later united as the Province of Hohenzollern.

===1848–1871: German wars of unification===
During the half-century that followed the Congress of Vienna, a conflict of ideals took place within the German Confederation between the formation of a single German nation and the conservation of the current collection of smaller German states and kingdoms. The main debate centered around whether Prussia or the Austrian Empire should be the leading member of any unified Germany. Those advocating for Prussian leadership contended that Austria had far too many non-German interests to work for the greater good of Germany. They argued that Prussia, as by far the most powerful state with a majority of German-speakers, was best suited to lead the new nation.

The establishment of the German Customs Union () in 1834, which excluded Austria, increased Prussian influence over the member states. In the wake of the Revolutions of 1848, the Frankfurt Parliament in 1849 offered King Frederick William IV of Prussia the crown of a united Germany. Frederick William refused the offer on the grounds that revolutionary assemblies could not grant royal titles. But he also refused for two other reasons: to do so would have done little to end the internal power-struggle between Austria and Prussia, and all Prussian kings (up to and including William I) feared that the formation of a German Empire would mean the end of Prussia&#x27;s independence within the German states.

In 1848, actions taken by Denmark towards the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein led to the First War of Schleswig (1848–51) between Denmark and the German Confederation, resulting in a Danish victory.

Frederick William issued Prussia&#x27;s first constitution by his own authority in 1848, modifying it in the Constitution of 1850. These documents—moderate by the standards of the time but conservative by today&#x27;s—provided for a two-chamber parliament, the &quot;Landtag&quot;. The lower house, later known as the , was elected by all males over the age of 25 using the Prussian three-class franchise. Voters were divided into three classes whose votes were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid. In one typical election, the first class (with those who paid the most in taxes) included 4% of voters and the third class (with those who paid the least) had 82%, yet each group chose the same number of electors. The system all but assured dominance by the more well-to-do men of the population. The upper house, later renamed the (&quot;House of Lords&quot;), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority, and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. The constitution nevertheless contained a number of liberal elements such as the introduction of jury courts and a catalog of fundamental rights that included freedom of religion, speech and the press.

Frederick William suffered a stroke in 1857, and his younger brother, Prince William, became regent. William pursued a considerably more moderate policy. Upon Frederick William IV&#x27;s death in 1861 he succeeded to the Prussian throne as William I. However, shortly after becoming king, he faced a dispute with his parliament over the size of the army. The parliament, dominated by the liberals, balked at William&#x27;s desire to increase the number of regiments and withheld approval of the budget to pay for its cost. A deadlock ensued, and William seriously considered abdicating in favour of his son, Crown Prince Frederick. Ultimately, he decided to appoint as prime minister Otto von Bismarck, at that time the Prussian ambassador to France. Bismarck took office on 23 September 1862.
Although Bismarck had a reputation as an unyielding conservative, he initially inclined to seek a compromise over the budget issue. However, William refused to consider it; he viewed defence issues as the crown&#x27;s personal province. Forced into a policy of confrontation, Bismarck came up with a novel theory. Under the constitution, the king and the parliament were responsible for agreeing on the budget. Bismarck argued that since they had failed to come to an agreement, there was a &quot;hole&quot; in the constitution, and the government had to continue to collect taxes and disburse funds in accordance with the old budget in order to keep functioning. The government thus operated without a new budget from 1862 to 1866, allowing Bismarck to implement William&#x27;s military reforms.

The liberals violently denounced Bismarck for what they saw as his disregard for the fundamental law of the kingdom. However, Bismarck&#x27;s real plan was an accommodation with liberalism. Although he had opposed German unification earlier in his career, he had now come to believe it inevitable. To his mind, the conservative forces had to take the lead in the drive toward creating a unified nation in order to keep from being eclipsed. He also believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they wanted to break the grip of the traditional forces over society. He thus embarked on a drive to form a united Germany under Prussian leadership, and guided Prussia through three wars which ultimately achieved this goal.

The first of these wars was the Second War of Schleswig (1864), which Prussia initiated and succeeded in, and in which it gained the assistance of Austria. Denmark was soundly defeated and surrendered both Schleswig and Holstein, to Prussia and Austria respectively.
The divided administration of Schleswig and Holstein then became the trigger for the Austro-Prussian War of 1866—also known as the Seven Weeks&#x27; War. Prussia, allied with the Kingdom of Italy and various northern German states, declared war on the Austrian Empire. The Austrian-led coalition was crushed, and Prussia annexed four of its smaller allies—the Kingdom of Hanover, the Electorate of Hesse, the Duchy of Nassau and the Free City of Frankfurt. Prussia also annexed Schleswig and Holstein, and also effectively annexed Saxe-Lauenburg by forcing it into a personal union with Prussia (which was turned into a full union in 1876). King William initially wanted to take territory from Austria itself and annex Saxony, but Bismarck persuaded him to abandon the idea. While Bismarck wanted Austria to play no future role in German affairs, he foresaw that Austria could be a valuable future ally. With these gains in territory, the Prussian possessions in the Rhineland and Westphalia became geographically connected to the rest of the kingdom for the first time. Counting the &quot;de facto&quot; annexation of Saxe-Lauenburg, Prussia now stretched uninterrupted across the northern two-thirds of Germany. It would remain at this size until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1918.

Bismarck used this opportunity to end the budget dispute with parliament. He proposed a bill of indemnity granting him retroactive approval for governing without a legal budget. He guessed, correctly as it turned out, that this would lead to a split between his liberal adversaries. While some of them argued that there could be no compromise with the principle of constitutional government, most of the liberals decided to support the bill in hopes of winning more freedom in the future.

The German Confederation was dissolved as part of the war. In its place, Prussia cajoled the 21 states north of the Main into forming the North German Confederation in 1866. Prussia entered the Confederation as a whole (including the East Prussian cradle of its statehood, as well as its share of dismembered Poland consisting of Province of Posen and West Prussia), thus becoming the dominant state in this new entity, with four-fifths of its territory and population—more than the other members of the confederation combined. Its near-total control was cemented in a constitution written by Bismarck. Executive power was vested in a president—a hereditary office of the rulers of Prussia. He was assisted by a chancellor responsible only to the president. There was also a bicameral parliament. The lower house, or Reichstag (Diet), was elected by universal male suffrage. The upper house, or Bundesrat (Federal Council) was appointed by the state governments. The Bundesrat was, in practice, the stronger chamber. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes and could easily control proceedings through alliances with the other states. For all intents and purposes, Bismarck dominated the new grouping. He served as his own foreign minister for virtually his entire tenure as prime minister of Prussia, and in that capacity was able to instruct the Prussian delegates to the Bundesrat.

The southern German states (except Austria) were forced to accept military alliances with Prussia, and Prussia began steps to merge them with the North German Confederation. Bismarck&#x27;s planned unification of Germany had come considerably closer to realisation.

The final act came with the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), where Bismarck maneuvered Emperor Napoleon III of France into declaring war on Prussia. Activating the German alliances put in place after the Austro-Prussian War, the German states, aside from Austria, came together and swiftly defeated France, even managing to take Napoleon III prisoner (2 September 1870). Even before then, Bismarck was able to complete the work of unifying Germany under Prussian leadership. The patriotic fervour aroused by the war against France overwhelmed the remaining opponents of a unified nation, and on 18 January 1871 (the 170th anniversary of the coronation of the first Prussian king, Frederick I), the German Empire was proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles outside of Paris, while the French capital was still under siege. King William became the first emperor () of a unified Germany. However, the titles of German Emperor and King of Prussia were to be borne by the same man until the end of the monarchy.

===1871–1918: Peak and fall===

Bismarck&#x27;s new empire was the most powerful state on the Continent. Prussia&#x27;s dominance over the new empire was almost as absolute as it was with the North German Confederation. It included two-thirds of the empire&#x27;s territory and three-fifths of its population. The imperial crown was a hereditary office of the House of Hohenzollern. Prussia also had a large plurality of seats in the Bundesrat, with 17 votes out of 58 (17 out of 61 after 1911); no other state had more than six votes. As before, it could effectively control the proceedings with the support of its allies in the secondary states. As mentioned above, Bismarck served as foreign minister of Prussia for almost his entire career, and in that role instructed the Prussian deputies to the Bundesrat. The Imperial German Army was essentially an enlarged Prussian army, and the embassies of the new empire were mostly old Prussian embassies. The Constitution of the German Empire was essentially an amended version of the constitution of the North German Confederation.

However, the seeds for future problems lay in a gross disparity between the imperial and Prussian systems. The empire granted the vote to all men over 25, although Prussia retained its three-class franchise, in which votes were weighted by taxes paid. Since the imperial chancellor was, except for two periods (January–November 1873 and 1892–94) also prime minister of Prussia, this meant that for most of the empire&#x27;s existence, the king/emperor and prime minister/chancellor had to seek majorities from legislatures elected by two completely different franchises.

At the time of the empire&#x27;s creation, both Prussia and Germany were roughly two-thirds rural. Within 20 years, the situation was reversed; the cities and towns accounted for two-thirds of the population. However, in both the kingdom and the empire, the constituencies were never redrawn to reflect the growing population and influence of the cities and towns. This meant that rural areas were grossly overrepresented from the 1890s onward.

Bismarck realized that the rest of Europe was sceptical of his powerful new Reich, and turned his attention to preserving peace with such acts as the Congress of Berlin. The new German Empire improved its already-strong relations with Britain. The ties between London and Berlin had already been sealed in 1858, when Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia married Victoria, Princess Royal.

William I died in 1888, and the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as Frederick III. The new emperor, a decided Anglophile, planned to transform Prussia and the empire into a more liberal and democratic monarchy based on the British model. However, Frederick was already ill with inoperable throat cancer, and died after only 99 days on the throne. He was succeeded by his 29-year-old son, William II. As a boy, William had rebelled against his parents&#x27; efforts to mould him as a liberal, and had become thoroughly Prussianized under Bismarck&#x27;s tutelage.

The new Kaiser William rapidly soured relations with the British and Russian royal families (despite being closely related to them), becoming their rival and ultimately their enemy. Before and during World War I (1914–1918), Prussia supplied significant numbers of soldiers and sailors in the German military, and Prussian Junkers dominated the higher ranks. In addition, portions of the Eastern Front were fought on Prussian soil. Prussia – along with Germany as a whole – experienced increasing troubles with revolutionaries during the war. The Great War ended by armistice on 11 November 1918.

Uprisings in Berlin and other centres began the civil conflict of the German Revolution of 1918–19 (). By late 1918, the Prussian House of Representatives was controlled by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which advocated Marxism. William knew that he had lost his imperial crown for good, but still hoped to retain his Prussian crown; he believed that as ruler of two-thirds of Germany, he could remain a major figure in any successor regime. However, William discovered this was impossible under the imperial constitution. Although he believed he ruled the empire in personal union with Prussia, the imperial constitution stipulated that the imperial crown was tied to the Prussian crown. In any event, he had lost support of the military who might have fought for him. William&#x27;s abdication as both king of Prussia and German emperor was announced on 9 November 1918, and he went into exile in the Netherlands the next day. With armed revolts, mass strikes, and street fighting in Berlin, the Prussian state government declared a state of siege and appealed for imperial military aid. The &quot;Garde-Kavallerie-Schützen-Division&quot;, commanded by Waldemar Pabst, moved against the strikers in Berlin. By the end of the fighting on 16 March, they had killed approximately 1,200 people, many of them unarmed and uninvolved. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the establishment in August 1919 of a republic that later became known as the Weimar Republic.

Prussia was incorporated as the Free State of Prussia in the Weimar Republic, gaining a new republican constitution in 1920, becoming the Free State of Prussia. The state was abolished in 1947.

==State==
===Government===

The joint authority, feudal and bureaucratic, on which Prussian absolute monarchy was based, saw its interests laid in suppression of the drive for personal freedom and democratic rights. It therefore had to recourse on police methods. The &quot;police state&quot;, as Otto Hintze described it, replaced the older system with its feudal squirearchy run in the interests of the ruling class, but which in its rudimentary form was a constitutional state.

===Politics===

The Kingdom of Prussia was an absolute monarchy until the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, after which Prussia became a constitutional monarchy and Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg was appointed as Prussia&#x27;s first Minister President. Following Prussia&#x27;s first constitution, a two-house parliament was formed, called the Landtag. The lower house, or Prussian House of Representatives was elected by all males over the age of 25 using the Prussian three-class franchise introduced in the Constitution of 1850, which assured dominance by the more well-to-do elements of the population. The upper house, which was later renamed the Prussian House of Lords, was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the Prussian Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. Prussian Secret Police, formed in response to the German revolutions of 1848–1849, aided the conservative government.

===Constitutions===

There were two constitutions during the kingdom&#x27;s existence, those of 1848 and 1850. The first was granted by the reluctant Frederick William IV in response to demands that arose during the German revolutions of 1848–1849. Elections were called in early 1848 for a Prussian National Assembly, with all males 25 and older able to vote. King Frederick William IV and his ministers presented a draft constitution in which the king retained many of his old rights. The Assembly responded with the &quot;Charte Waldeck&quot; which included an expanded list of fundamental rights, a (&#x27;people&#x27;s guard&#x27;) responsible to parliament and restrictions on feudal rights. The King declared to his ministers that &quot;he would never accept [it] under any conditions&quot;. On 9 November he adjourned the Assembly and on 5 December 1848 unilaterally imposed the Constitution of 1848. It contained a significant number of liberal elements from the Charte Waldeck, including a parliament with two chambers, the introduction of jury courts, certain limitations on the monarch&#x27;s powers and a mandate to ensure legal certainty. It also guaranteed many fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, the press and religion.

In spite of the constitution&#x27;s liberal clauses, Prussia was still far from a democratic state. The king had an absolute veto over laws, which restricted the separation of powers. It was possible for the monarch to circumvent the judiciary, and the military could be described as a state within the state. All adult male citizens regardless of class had the right to vote, but the Prussian three-class franchise that weighted votes based on the amount of taxes paid significantly limited the political voice of the middle and lower classes.

The 1850 Constitution of Prussia was an amended version of the 1848 Constitution. Unlike the earlier version, the 1850 revision was a cooperative effort between the new Prussian Parliament, the King and his ministers. The changes they made to the 1848 Constitution were mostly of a minor nature. The king remained in a position of dominance over the three branches of government, and parliament had no control over the military, but the liberal elements introduced in the 1848 Constitution remained largely in place.

The 1850 Constitution, frequently amended, was the fundamental law of Prussia until the end of the German Empire in 1918.

==Religion==
The Prussian Constitution of 1850 allowed for freedom of conscience, freedom of public and private worship and freedom of association with religious bodies. It stated that all churches and other religious associations should administer everything independently and privately from the state and that no part of the government may affect the Church. The constitution also stated that all children should be taught their religion from people of their own religion and not by someone else.

According to a census taken in the early- to mid-1800s, there was a division of six religions around the 1830s: this was, per million inhabitants, 609,427.0 practising Protestants, 376,177.1 practising Catholics, 13,348.8 practising Jews, 925.1 Mennonites, 121.4 Greek Orthodox and 0.6 Muslims. At this time, the total population was 14,098,125 people, meaning there were approximately 8,591,778 practising Protestants, 5,303,392 practising Catholics, 188,193 practising Jews, 13,042 Mennonites, 1,712 Greek Orthodox, and 8 Muslims.

Although dominated by Protestant Lutherans (along with some Calvinist), it contained millions of Catholics in the west and in Poland. There were numerous Catholic populations in the Rhineland and parts of Westphalia. In addition, West Prussia, Warmia, Silesia, and the province of Posen had predominantly Catholic Polish-speaking populations. East Prussia&#x27;s southern region of Masuria was mostly made up of Germanised Protestant Masurs.

== Ethnicity ==
Apart from ethnic Germans, the country was also inhabited by ethnolinguistic minorities. Minority groups included Poles (including Kashubs in West Prussia and Mazurs in East Prussia), Prussian Lithuanians (in East Prussia), Sorbs (in Lusatia), Czechs and Moravians (in Silesia), Danes (in Schleswig), Jews, Frisians, Dutch, Walloons, Russians (in Wojnowo (Eckertsdorf)), French, Italians, Hungarians and others.

==Subdivisions==
The original core regions of the Kingdom of Prussia were the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia which together formed Brandenburg-Prussia. A Further Pomeranian province had been held by Prussia since 1653. Combined with Swedish Pomerania, gained from Sweden in 1720 and 1815, this region formed the Province of Pomerania. Prussian gains in the Silesian Wars led to the formation of the Province of Silesia in 1740.

After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the newly annexed Royal Prussia and Warmia became the Province of West Prussia, while the Duchy of Prussia (along with part of Warmia) became the Province of East Prussia. Other annexations along the Noteć (Netze) River became the Netze District. Following the second and third partitions (1793–1795), the new Prussian annexations became the provinces of New Silesia, South Prussia, and New East Prussia, with the Netze District redivided between West and South Prussia. All the acquired Polish lands remained outside of the Holy Roman Empire, and the latter three provinces were disentangled from Prussia following the Treaties of Tilsit to be included in the Napoleonic Grand Duchy of Warsaw in 1806, and were ultimately lost to Congress Poland after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, except for the western part of South Prussia, which would form part of the Grand Duchy of Posen, the latter however also remained outside of German Confederation, the successor of the dissolved Holy Roman Empire, as did the province of East Prussia and the province of West Prussia.

Following the major western gains made by Prussia after the Vienna Congress, a total of ten provinces were established, each one subdivided further into smaller administrative regions known as . The provinces were:
* Province of Brandenburg
* Province of East Prussia (outside of German Confederation)
* Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg
* Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine
* Province of Pomerania
* Grand Duchy of Posen (autonomous, outside of German Confederation)
* Province of Saxony
* Province of Silesia
* Province of West Prussia (outside of German Confederation)
* Province of Westphalia

In 1822, the provinces of Jülich-Cleves-Berg and the Lower Rhine were merged to form the Rhine Province. In 1829, the provinces of East and West Prussia merged to form the Province of Prussia, but the separate provinces were reformed in 1878. The principalities of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Hohenzollern-Hechingen were annexed in 1850 to form the Province of Hohenzollern.

After Prussia&#x27;s victory in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, territories annexed by Prussia were reorganised into three new provinces:
* Province of Hanover
* Province of Hesse-Nassau
* Province of Schleswig-Holstein

<doc id="242702" wikidata="Q382370" url="?curid=242702" title="Mpox">
<text>Mpox (, ; formerly known as monkeypox) is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and other animals. Symptoms include a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. The illness is usually mild, and most infected individuals recover within a few weeks without treatment. The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms ranges from three to seventeen days, and symptoms typically last from two to four weeks. However, cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women, or people with suppressed immune systems.
The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a zoonotic virus in the genus &quot;Orthopoxvirus&quot;. The variola virus, which causes smallpox, is also in this genus. Human-to-human transmission can occur through direct contact with infected skin or body fluids, including sexual contact. People remain infectious from the onset of symptoms until all the lesions have scabbed and healed. The virus may spread from infected animals through handling infected meat or via bites or scratches. Diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing a lesion for the virus&#x27;s DNA.
Vaccination is recommended for those at high risk of infection. No vaccine has been developed specifically against mpox, but smallpox vaccines have been found to be effective. There is no specific treatment for the disease, so the aim of treatment is to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Antiviral drugs such as tecovirimat can be used to treat mpox, although their effectiveness has not been proven.
Mpox is endemic in Central and Western Africa, where several species of mammals are suspected to act as a natural reservoir of the virus. The first human cases were diagnosed in 1970 in Basankusu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, the frequency and severity of outbreaks have significantly increased, possibly as a result of waning immunity since the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. A global outbreak of clade II in 2022–2023 marked the first incidence of widespread community transmission outside of Africa. In July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The WHO reverted this status in May 2023, as the outbreak came under control, citing a combination of vaccination and public health information as successful control measures.

An outbreak of new variant of clade I mpox (known as clade Ib) was detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during 2023. As of August 2024, it had spread to several African countries, raising concerns that it may have adapted to more sustained human transmission. In August 2024, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.

==Nomenclature==
The name &quot;monkeypox&quot; was originally coined after being found in 1958 during two outbreaks in research monkeys in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Beginning during the 2022 outbreak, public health experts and researchers, particularly in Africa, had urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to rename the disease. Social media has been rife with racist comments that associate the disease’s name with African populations. Stigmatizing remarks had also wrongly identified monkeypox as a &quot;gay disease,&quot; as gay men, bisexuals, and men who have sex with men are among the most affected globally. This stigma is thought to deter individuals from seeking diagnosis, vaccination, and treatment, reminiscent of the early days of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s. Additionally, misinformation has incited violence against monkeys in certain regions, wrongly held accountable for transmitting &quot;monkeypox&quot;.
The WHO put forth its approval for the new name Mpox, which was gradually adopted as the preferred term in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) after December 2023. The name change retains a connection to poxviruses while making it easier to spell in various languages. The subtypes of mpox virus were also renamed; the clade formerly known as &quot;Congo Basin (Central African)&quot; was renamed cladeI, and the clade formerly known as &quot;West African&quot; was renamed cladeII. For the purpose of preserving access to historical records to facilitate research, the term &quot;monkeypox&quot; and old subtypes names will remain in the ICD database as searchable terms.

==Signs and symptoms==


Initial symptoms of mpox infection are fever, muscle pains, and sore throat, followed by an itchy or painful rash, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. Not everyone will exhibit the complete range of symptoms.

People with mpox usually become symptomatic about a week after infection. However the incubation period can vary in a range between one day and four weeks.

The rash comprises numerous small lesions, which may appear on the palms, soles, face, mouth, throat, genitals, or anus. They begin as small flat spots, before developing into small bumps, which then fill with fluid, eventually bursting and scabbing over, typically lasting around ten days. In rare cases, lesions may become necrotic, requiring debridement and taking longer to heal.

Some people may manifest only a single sore from the disease, while others may have hundreds. An individual can be infected with &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot; without showing any symptoms. Symptoms typically last for two to four weeks but may persist longer in people with weakened immune systems.

===Complications===
Complications include secondary infections, pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, and loss of vision following corneal infection. Persons with weakened immune systems, whether due to medication, medical conditions, or HIV, are more likely to develop severe cases of the disease. If infection occurs during pregnancy, this may lead to stillbirth or other complications.

===Outcome===
Provided there are no complications, sequelae are rare; after healing, the scabs may leave pale marks before becoming darker scars.

===Deaths===
Historically, the case fatality rate (CFR) of past outbreaks was estimated at between 1% and 10%, with clade I considered to be more severe than clade II.

The case fatality rate of the 2022–2023 global outbreak caused by clade IIb was very low, estimated at 0.16%, with the majority of deaths in individuals who were already immunocompromized. In contrast, , the outbreak of clade I in Democratic Republic of the Congo has a CFR of 4.9%.

The difference between these estimates is attributed to:
* differences in the virulence of clade I versus clade II.
* under-reporting of mild or asymptomatic cases in the endemic areas of Africa, which generally have poor healthcare infrastructure.
* evolution of the virus to cause milder disease in humans.
* better general health, and better health care, in the populations most affected by the 2022–2023 global outbreak.

===In other animals===
It is thought that small mammals provide a reservoir for the virus in endemic areas. Spread among animals occurs via the fecal–oral route and through the nose, through wounds and eating infected meat. The disease has also been reported in a wide range of other animals, including monkeys, anteaters, hedgehogs, prairie dogs, squirrels, and shrews. Signs and symptoms in animals are not well researched and further studies are in progress.

There have been instances of animal infection outside of endemic Africa; during the 2003 US outbreak, prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot;) became infected and presented with fever, cough, sore eyes, poor feeding and rash. There has also been an instance of a domestic dog (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) which became infected displaying lesions and ulceration.

==Cause==
Mpox in both humans and animals is caused by infection with &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot; – a double-stranded DNA virus in the genus &quot;Orthopoxvirus&quot;, family &quot;Poxviridae,&quot; making it closely related to the smallpox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses.

The two major subtypes of virus are cladeI and cladeII. In April 2024, after detection of a new variant, cladeI was split into subclades designated Ia and Ib. CladeII is similarly divided into subclades: cladeIIa and cladeIIb.

CladeI is estimated to cause more severe disease and higher mortality than cladeII.

The virus is considered to be endemic in tropical rainforest regions of Central and West Africa. In addition to monkeys, the virus has been identified in Gambian pouched rats (&quot;Cricetomys gambianus&quot;), dormice (&quot;Graphiurus&quot; spp.) and African squirrels (&quot;Heliosciurus&quot;, and &quot;Funisciurus&quot;). The use of these animals as food may be an important source of transmission to humans.

==Transmission==
The natural reservoir of &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot; is thought to be small mammals in tropical Africa. The virus can be transmitted from animal to human from bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, or cooking infected animals. The virus enters the body through broken skin, or mucosal surfaces such as the mouth, respiratory tract, or genitals.

Mpox can be transmitted from one person to another through contact with infectious lesion material or fluid on the skin, in the mouth or on the genitals; this includes touching, close contact, and during sex. During the 2022–2023 global outbreak of clade II, transmission between people was almost exclusively via sexual contact.

There is also a risk of infection from fomites (objects which can become infectious after being touched by an infected person) such as clothing or bedding which has been contaminated with lesion material.

==Diagnosis==
Clinical differential diagnosis distinguishes between rash illnesses, such as chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, poison ivy, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of samples from skin lesions is the preferred diagnostic test, although it has the disadvantage of being relatively slow to deliver a result. In October 2024, the WHO approved the first diagnostic test under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) procedure. The Alinity m MPXV assay enables the detection of the virus by laboratory testing swabs of skin lesions, giving a result in less than two hours.

==Prevention==
===Vaccine===

Historically, smallpox vaccine had been reported to reduce the risk of mpox among previously vaccinated persons in Africa. The decrease in immunity to poxviruses in exposed populations is a factor in the increasing prevalence of human mpox. It is attributed to waning cross-protective immunity among those vaccinated before 1980, when mass smallpox vaccinations were discontinued, and to the gradually increasing proportion of unvaccinated individuals.

As of August 2024, there are four vaccines in use to prevent mpox. All were originally developed to combat smallpox.

* MVA-BN (marketed as Jynneos, Imvamune or Imvanex) manufactured by Bavarian Nordic. Licensed for use against mpox in Europe, United States and Canada.
* LC16 from KMB Biologics (Japan) – licensed for use in Japan.
* OrthopoxVac, licensed for use in Russia and manufactured by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia
* ACAM2000, manufactured by Emergent BioSolutions. Approved for use against mpox in the United States as of August 2024.

The MVA-BN vaccine, originally developed for smallpox, has been approved in the United States for use by persons who are either considered at high risk of exposure to mpox, or who may have recently been exposed to it. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that persons investigating mpox outbreaks, those caring for infected individuals or animals, and those exposed by close or intimate contact with infected individuals or animals should receive a vaccination.

===Other measures===
The CDC has made detailed recommendations in addition to the standard precautions for infection control. These include that healthcare providers don a gown, mask, goggles, and a disposable filtering respirator (such as an N95), and that an infected person should be isolated a private room to keep others from possible contact.

Those living in countries where mpox is endemic should avoid contact with sick mammals such as rodents, marsupials, non-human primates (dead or alive) that could harbour &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot; and should refrain from eating or handling wild game (bush meat).

During the 2022–2023 outbreak, several public health authorities launched public awareness campaigns in order to reduce spread of the disease.

==Treatment==
Most cases of mpox present with mild symptoms and there is complete recovery within 2 to 4 weeks. There is no specific treatment for the disease, although antivirals such as tecovirimat have been approved for the treatment of severe mpox. A 2023 Cochrane review found no completed randomized controlled trials studying therapeutics for the treatment of mpox. The review identified non-randomized controlled trials which evaluated the safety of therapeutics for mpox, finding no significant risks from tecovirimat and low certainty evidence that suggests brincidofovir may cause mild liver injury. Pain is common and may be severe; supportive care such as pain or fever control may be administered. People with mild disease should isolate at home, stay hydrated, eat well, and take steps to maintain their mental health.

People who are at high risk from the disease include children, pregnant women, the elderly and those who are immunocompromized. For these people, or those who have severe disease, hospital admission and careful monitoring of symptoms is recommended. Symptomatic treatment is recommended for complications such as proctitis and pruritis.

A trial in the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that the antiviral drug tecovirimat did not shorten the duration of mpox lesions in people with clade I mpox. Despite this, the trial&#x27;s overall mortality rate of 1.7% was notably lower than the 3.6% or higher mortality rate seen in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s general mpox cases. This suggests that hospitalization and high-quality supportive care significantly improve outcomes for mpox people. The trial was sponsored by the NIH and co-led by the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale.

An additional 2024 study on Siga Technologies’ antiviral drug, tecovirimat, found it ineffective in reducing lesion healing time or pain in adults with the clade II strain of mpox. Based on interim results, a safety board recommended halting further patient enrollment. The trial, launched in September 2022 by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, involved patients from several countries, including the U.S., Argentina, and Japan, who had mpox symptoms for less than 14 days. An interim analysis revealed no significant differences in lesion resolution or pain reduction between tecovirimat and a placebo. 

=== Diagnostics in resource limited settings ===
With the August 2024 outbreak in the DRC, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged manufacturers to submit their products for emergency review. This initiative is part of the WHO&#x27;s effort to ensure effective diagnostics, particularly for low-income populations. The agency has called for manufacturers to submit their tests for Emergency Use Listing, which would allow the WHO to approve these medical products more quickly. This process is designed to help countries procure essential products through UN agencies and other partners. The urgency comes as a new, easily transmissible form of the 2024 outbreak has raised global concerns, leading the WHO to declare mpox a global public health emergency.

==Epidemiology==

===History===
Mpox was first identified as a distinct illness in 1958 among laboratory monkeys in Copenhagen, Denmark. The first documented human cases occurred in 1970, involving six unvaccinated children during the smallpox eradication efforts, with the first being a 9-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. From 1981 to 1986, over 300 human cases of mpox were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then known as Zaire), primarily due to contact with animals. The virus has been detected in Gambian pouched rats, dormice, and African squirrels, which are often used as food.

Many more mpox cases have been reported in Central and West Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 2,000 cases per year were recorded between 2011 and 2014. However, the collected data is often incomplete and unconfirmed, hindering accurate estimations of the number of mpox cases over time. Originally thought to be uncommon in humans, cases have increased since the 1980s, possibly as a result of waning immunity following the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination.

===Future threat===
The natural reservoir of &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot; has not been conclusively determined. Small rodents are considered the most likely candidate. Without a major vaccination campaign, mpox outbreaks in humans will continue indefinitely in the endemic areas, with an ongoing risk that disease outbreaks will spread to non-endemic areas. Other evidence – that the virus is evolving to be more transmissible among humans, that it can infect a wide range of host species, and that human-to-animal transmission can occur – led to concerns that mpox may either become established in new natural reservoirs outside of Africa, or cause future global epidemics.

Following the 2022–2023 outbreak, mpox (clade IIb) remains present in the human population outside Africa at very low levels. In November 2023, the WHO reported increasing numbers of cases of mpox (clade I) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 12,569 cases year-to-date and 651 fatalities; there was also the first evidence of sexual transmission of clade I.

There has been a rise in mpoxvirus clade I infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since November 2023, with more cases now reported in other African countries that previously had no mpox cases. Two imported cases were also found in Sweden and Thailand. As of August 23, 2024, over 20,000 mpox cases have been reported in 13 African Union Member States, with 3,311 confirmed cases and 582 deaths. Most cases are found in the DRC, where subclade Ia and Ib are prevalent.

Clade Ib was linked to a reported mpox case in Sweden on August 15, 2024, which was related to traveling to an African country where the virus is found. Despite the low incidence, cases associated with clade II have been reported in EU/EEA countries since. In 2024, the WHO added the monkeypox virus to its list of &quot;priority pathogens&quot; that could cause a pandemic.

==Outbreaks==
This section is an incomplete list of disease outbreaks which have been reported, including significant outbreaks in the endemic countries in tropical Africa (Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan). Outbreaks of mpox are frequent in areas where the disease is endemic – these areas often have poor healthcare infrastructure and outbreaks are rarely documented.

In May 2003, a young child became ill with fever and rash after being bitten by a prairie dog purchased at a local swap meet near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In total, 71 cases of mpox were reported through 20 June 2003. All cases were traced to Gambian pouched rats imported from Accra, Ghana, in April 2003 by a Texas exotic animal distributor. No deaths resulted. Electron microscopy and serologic studies were used to confirm that the disease was human mpox. Everyone affected reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs, later found to be infected with the &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot;.

In July 2021, in the US, an American returning from a trip in Nigeria was diagnosed with mpox. Subsequent testing identified the virus as belonging to cladeII. The patient was hospitalized and treated with tecovirimat and was discharged after 32 days.

The first case of clade I mpox in the United States was identified in November 2024; the California Department of Public Health reported that an unidentified individual outside San Francisco had tested positive following travel to and from East Africa. Clade II mpox continues to circulate at low levels.

===Sudan===
During 2022, an outbreak of clade I mpox was reported in refugee camps in Sudan. The first case in the country was recorded in August, and in September, six additional cases were discovered in Khartoum. In October, more than 100 cases were reported among Ethiopian refugee camps.

===Nigeria===
Two cases of human mpox infections were identified in Nigeria in 1971.
In September 2017, &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot; was reported in Nigeria. The subsequent outbreak was, at that time, the largest ever outbreak of cladeII of the virus, with 118 confirmed cases. Unlike previous outbreaks of this clade, infection was predominantly among young male adults and human-to-human transmission appears to have readily occurred. Seven deaths (5 male, 2 female, case fatality rate of 6%) were reported, including a baby and four HIV/AIDS people. Additionally, a pregnant woman in her second trimester had a spontaneous miscarriage attributed to &quot;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox&quot; infection.

In May 2022, the Nigerian government released a report stating that between 2017 and 2022, 558 cases were confirmed across 32 states and the Federal Capital Territory. There were 8 deaths reported, making for a 1.4% Case Fatality Ratio. In 2022, NCDC implemented a National Technical Working Group for reporting and monitoring infections, strengthening response capacity.

===United Kingdom===
In September 2018, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first case of mpox was recorded. The person, a Nigerian national, is believed to have contracted mpox in Nigeria before travelling to the United Kingdom. A second case was confirmed in the town of Blackpool, with a further case that of a medical worker who cared for the infected person from Blackpool.

In December 2019, mpox was diagnosed in a person in South West England who had traveled to the UK from Nigeria.

In May 2021, two cases of mpox from a single household were identified by Public Health Wales in the UK. The index case had traveled from Nigeria. Covid guidance to isolate after travel helped detection of the outbreak and to prevent further transmission.

===Singapore===
In May 2019, a 38-year-old man who traveled from Nigeria was hospitalized in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore, after being confirmed as the country&#x27;s first case of mpox. As a result, 22 people were quarantined. The case may have been linked to a simultaneous outbreak in Nigeria.

===2022–2023 global outbreak===
An outbreak of mpox caused by clade IIb of the virus was first identified in May 2022. The first case was detected in London, United Kingdom, on 6 May, in a patient with a recent travel history from Nigeria, where the disease is endemic. Subsequent cases were reported in an increasing number of countries and regions. In July 2022, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. This status was terminated in May 2023 due to steady progress in controlling the spread of the disease, attributed to a combination of vaccination and public health information. , clade IIb mpox cases outside of endemic regions in Africa continued to be reported at a low level.

===2023–2024 Central Africa outbreak===

During 2023, a clade I outbreak of mpox disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo resulted in 14,626 suspected cases being reported, with 654 associated deaths, making for a case-fatality rate of 4.5%. The outbreak continued into 2024, with 3,576 suspected mpox cases and 265 deaths reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo through the first nine weeks of the year, making for an estimated CFR of 7.4%.

Transmission of the virus in the outbreak appears to be primarily through sexual and close familial contact, with cases occurring in areas without a history of mpox, such as South Kivu and Kinshasa. An estimated 64% of the cases and 85% of fatalities have occurred in children. The outbreak consists of two separate sub-variants of clade I, with one of the sub-variants having a novel mutation, making detection with standard assays unreliable.

The outbreak spread to the neighbouring country of the Republic of the Congo, with 43 cases reported in March 2024. By August 2024, the outbreak spread further into central and southern Africa with cases of clade I and clade II strains reported in Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and South Africa.

The WHO declared a global health emergency in August 2024. Sweden became the first non-African country to report a case of clade I mpox. A case of mpox was confirmed in Pakistan.
