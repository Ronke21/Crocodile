<text>Maitland () is a city in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia and the seat of Maitland City Council, situated on the Hunter River approximately by road north of Sydney and north-west of Newcastle. It is on the New England Highway approximately from its origin at Hexham.

At the it had approximately 89,597 inhabitants, spread over an area of , with most of the population located in a strip along the New England Highway between the suburbs of Lochinvar and Thornton. The city centre is located on the right bank of the Hunter River, protected from moderate potential flooding by a levee.

Surrounding areas include the cities of Cessnock and Singleton local government areas.

==History==
The Wonnarua People were the first known people of this land. They called the area where Maitland is now situated, by the name Bo-un after a species of bird.

From around 1816, cedar logging parties from the convict settlement of Newcastle were the first Europeans to stay on the site. Governor Lachlan Macquarie visited the area in 1818, naming it Wallis Plains after Captain James Wallis who was commandant of the Newcastle penal colony at the time. In 1819, convict farmers were allowed to select land at Wallis Plains, the most notable of which was Molly Morgan. 

Tom White Melville Winder was one of the largest proprietors on the Hunter. Winder held 7400 acres (2995 ha) by 1828 and by 1831 had acquired another 2600 acres (1052 ha). The oldest house (commenced 1821) in the greater Maitland LGA was called “Windermere” and also referred to the adjacent farmlands which were for agriculture and later a “boiling-down works”. Windermere estate was established before East Maitland and West Maitland were established as suburbs and so is of historical significance.

By 1821 the first British government buildings, consisting of a cottage and barracks, were constructed, and in 1823 James Mudie financed the construction of a wharf. Two years later William Powditch opened the first general store at Wallis Plains.

In 1829, assistant surveyor George Boyle White, officially laid out a township on the site of Wallis Plains. The village was called Maitland possibly in honour of Frederick Lewis Maitland. Due to population growth, Maitland was partitioned in 1835 into West Maitland (which was the original Wallis Plains settlement) and East Maitland. The nearby town of Morpeth developed at the same time from the Green Hills land grant given to Lieutenant Edward Charles Close, a Peninsular War veteran. Morpeth served as the head of navigation for larger ships (later, steamships), and goods were transhipped upriver to West Maitland on barges and smaller vessels. Originally the river route between Morpeth and West Maitland was , today after various floods and river course changes this has reduced to just .

West Maitland was therefore the point at which goods were unloaded for, and distributed to, the prosperous riverland of the Hunter Valley. Accordingly, there were large warehouses (some of which still exist) built, which faced onto the main High Street and backed onto the Hunter River. The arrival of the railway from Newcastle in the 1850s, coupled with the increasing silting of the river and larger ships spelt the end of the traditional river traffic.

The municipalities of West and East Maitland were merged in 1944 and the name of West Maitland was officially reverted to Maitland in 1949, from which the present city is now known. The city&#x27;s boundaries have been increased by incorporating parts of other local government areas since then (most notably Kearsley Shire which from 1946 to 1949 was the only local government area in Australia&#x27;s history to have a Communist majority of councillors).

The first electricity connected in the area was to Maitland Town Hall in 1922, to the hall&#x27;s front light.

===Belmore Bridge===

The first bridge to link West Maitland with what is now the suburb of Lorn was opened in 1869 and named in honour of the then Governor of New South Wales, the 4th Earl of Belmore. Although the bridge proved vital to the city&#x27;s development, the floods of 1893, 1913 and 1930 began to heighten the need for a new bridge that could withstand periodic flooding. A second Belmore Bridge, designed to withstand the impact of debris during floods, was built adjacent to the 1869 bridge in 1964. The new bridge, which redirected traffic away from St Andrews Street to a new intersection at the Maitland Court House, is one of the city&#x27;s three main river crossings.
===Floods===
Maitland&#x27;s proximity to the Hunter River has resulted in a succession of floods since European settlement. Over 200 floods have occurred on the Hunter River since settlement, 13 of those higher than the river&#x27;s normal peak limit of . Of these 13, all have had a direct effect on the city of Maitland.

Between 1830 and 1834 Maitland experienced five floods. The 1832 flood was severe with water reaching about and killing seven people. The 1834 flood water reached the same height. In the winter of 1857 the Hunter River rose again to record heights, reaching . Flooding continued for the next 30 years with the floods of the 1890s being the most disastrous. Much of the riverbank collapsed and many people were left without homes or personal possessions.

Flooding was described as an “annoyance” and “detrimental to the town” in the 7 April 1840 advertisement for the sale of “&quot;Windermere&quot;” where position “on a hill” was described as an appealing feature.

The 1940s and 1950s saw an increase in rainfall and the river rose again and again. In February 1955, Maitland and the Hunter Valley experienced its most severe flood in recorded history. The 1955 Hunter Valley floods, also commonly known as &quot;The Maitland Flood&quot;, was the first Australian natural disaster to be broadcast by the media on an international scale. This flood is considered to be one of Australia&#x27;s worst floods. The waters reached and caused catastrophic damage and loss of life. The volume of flood water was approximately and the cost of damage, in today&#x27;s currency, would have been over A$2 billion. Seven thousand buildings and homes were damaged and the flood claimed the lives of 14 people.

In early June 2007 an intense low pressure system which caused devastating storms to hit the city of Newcastle and the Central Coast also caused major flooding throughout the lower Hunter Region including the Maitland area. During the flooding in 2007, the Hunter River was expected to reach a peak of at Maitland&#x27;s Belmore Bridge and break levee banks. Some 4000 residents of the suburb of Lorn were evacuated before the floodwaters became stable at and did not inundate central Maitland. Other areas did not escape with waters inundating homes in Branxton, Louth Park and Raymond Terrace. The flood has been compared to the devastating 1955 Hunter Valley floods.

From 20 to 22 April 2015, heavy rainfall in the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney regions of New South Wales resulted in flash flooding and extended power outages to over 200,000 homes. Maitland was badly affected and the flood gates at Maitland railway station were reinforced with sandbags to prevent flooding in central Maitland. Four people died as a result of the storms and a further four died in traffic related incidents. The towns of Dungog and Gillieston Heights, the homes of the four flood victims, were also badly affected, becoming isolated from other communities.


=== Jewish community ===

The Maitland Jewish Cemetery in Louth Park, one of only two provincial Jewish cemeteries in New South Wales, is testament to the Jewish community that was active in Maitland up until the 1930s. Between about 1846 and 1934, 53 Jewish people were buried in the low-lying cemetery. Burials ceased after this time due to dispersion of the community and the cemetery reaching capacity. One exception was Lea Abadee in 2010. The former Maitland Synagogue, located on Church Street, was the place of worship for about 70 families between 1879 and 1898.

== Hospital ==
The Immigrants Home was founded by Caroline Chisholm in East Maitland and was the first public building that was used to treat the sick. The site eventually became known as Maitland Benevolent Asylum. In 1835, when the population hit 1900, residents started to petition for a new hospital. In 1843 a meeting was called to discuss applying to Benevolent Asylum in Sydney. A committee was formed and succeeded in obtaining a grant of £1000 for a new hospital on 5 December 1844. In April 1845 Sir George Gipps approved a grant of a site at Campbell&#x27;s Hill, West Maitland opposite Boyne&#x27;s Inn. The foundation stone was laid by Edward Denny Day on 26 January 1846. In April 1846 the foundation stone was removed and was never recovered. In September 1847 the Building Committee announced that plans for the building of the new hospital would be accepted. The cost of the building was not to exceed £2000 and fifteen guineas would be awarded to the party furnishing the approved plan. By May 1848 the Maitland Mercury was reporting that the walls of the new hospital were visible from the town. Opened in 1850 its first years saw 231 patients and 26 deaths. Between 1903 and 1905 saw the completion of the Ward Block 1 at the southern end of the hospital. With the growth of population in the district, it was found that the accommodation was inadequate and a new building was erected and opened in 1905. In 1916 a blood bank and isolation cottage were completed. In 1926 the hospital became a training school for nurses. New nurses&#x27; quarters which occupied the site of the old Royal Oak Hotel was built during the twelve months from October 1927 to October 1928. In the 1930s Ward Block 3 was built and extensions were completed to the nurses home in 1932 and 1937.
The Addison Building (Ward Block 2) was progressively built and opened between 1942 and 1947. In 1960 new Nurses homes was built. In 1973 a new pathology building was opened. From 1975 to 1979 a new boilerhouse and workshops were built and the kitchen, cafeteria and storage areas were refurbished.

The hospital was funded through subscribers, collection boxes, donations and state revenue for fines. In 1847 Governor Sir Charles Fitzroy visited to the hospital to hand over a £10.

The Maitland Hospital was listed as a public hospital under the Second Schedule of the Public Hospitals Act, 1898 (Act No.16, 1898). Maitland Hospital was registered as a training hospital under the Nurses Registration Act, 1924 (Act No.37, 1924). From 1 November 1929 &#x27;The Maitland Hospital&#x27; was a hospital incorporated under Part IV of the Public Hospitals Act 1929 (Act No.8, 1929). Under this Act The Maitland Hospital was to be governed by a board of directors which could make by-laws and its subscribers were a body corporate which could be sue and be sued in its corporate name. ·The Area Health Services Act 1986 (Act No.50, 1986), which commenced on1 July 1986, effectively abolished the boards of directors and replaced them with area health boards this made the hospital a part of the Lower Hunter Area Health Service. From 1 August 1988 following the amalgamation of area health services the Maitland Hospital became part of the Hunter Area Health Service. Following amendments to the Health Services Act 1997 the Maitland Hospital became part of the Hunter and New England Area Health Service from 1 January 2005.

<doc id="241669" wikidata="Q1126160" url="?curid=241669" title="Connoisseur">
<text>A connoisseur (French traditional, pre-1835, spelling of , from Middle-French , then meaning &#x27;to be acquainted with&#x27; or &#x27;to know somebody/something&#x27;) is a person who has a great deal of knowledge about the fine arts; who is a keen appreciator of cuisines, fine wines, and other gourmet products; or who is an expert judge in matters of taste. In many areas, the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly ironic sense. In the art trade, however, expert connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the style and technique, where documentary evidence of provenance is lacking. The situation in the wine trade is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through wine tasting.

==Connoisseurship in art==
&quot;The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined ... as connoisseurship&quot;. Connoisseurs evaluate works of art on the basis of their experience of the style and technique of artists. Judgment informed by intuition is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of empirical evidence, refinement of perception about and form, and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to attribute authorship, validate authenticity and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the valuation of works, and can be collected and organized into a &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; of the work of a single artist or a school.

In his &quot;Meaning in the Visual Arts&quot; (1955), Erwin Panofsky explains the difference between a connoisseur and an art historian: &quot;The connoisseur might be defined as a laconic art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur.&quot;

The English dealer and art historian, Philip Mould says, &quot;it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era&quot;. He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks). His colleague, Bendor Grosvenor takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonné are undervalued by the art history establishment. Svetlana Alpers confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is &quot;essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs&quot;. Nonetheless, Christie&#x27;s Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship. This covers &quot;the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists&#x27; studios, conservation labs and museums.&quot;

===Earlier views of connoisseurship===
During the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend critic.

In 1760, Oliver Goldsmith said, &quot;Painting is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour.&quot;

In 1890, Giovanni Morelli wrote, &quot;art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art.&quot;

The attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885–1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909–1995).

==Connoisseurs in other fields==
Connoisseur is also used in the context of gastronomy, i.e. in connection with fine food, beer, wine, coffee, tea and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.

<doc id="241678" wikidata="Q172849" url="?curid=241678" title="Emerson Fittipaldi">
<text>Emerson Fittipaldi (; born 12 December 1946) is a Brazilian former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Fittipaldi was a two-time Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion, in which he won the and seasons with Lotus and McLaren, respectively; he scored 14 Grand Prix victories across 11 seasons. In American open-wheel racing, Fittipaldi won the IndyCar World Series in 1989 with Patrick, and is a two-time winner of the Indianapolis 500. 

Moving up from Formula Two, Fittipaldi made his race debut for Team Lotus as a third driver at the 1970 British Grand Prix. After Jochen Rindt was killed at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, the Brazilian became Lotus&#x27;s lead driver in only his fifth Grand Prix. He enjoyed considerable success with Lotus, winning the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1972 at the age of 25. At the time, he was the youngest ever F1 world champion, and he held the record for 33 years. He later moved to McLaren for 1974, winning the title once again, and helping McLaren win their first Constructors&#x27; Championship. He surprised the paddock by moving to his brother&#x27;s Fittipaldi Automotive team prior to the 1976 season, being replaced by James Hunt. Success eluded him during his final years in Formula One, with the Fittipaldi cars not competitive enough to fight for victories. Fittipaldi took two more podium finishes, before retiring in 1980.

Following his Formula One career, Fittipaldi moved to the American CART series, achieving numerous successes, including the 1989 CART title and two wins at the Indianapolis 500 in 1989 and 1993. Since his retirement from Indy Car racing in 1996, Fittipaldi races only occasionally. In 2008, he became one of only three people in history to have a Corvette production car named in his honor. At age 67, he entered the 2014 6 Hours of São Paulo.

==Early life==
Emerson Fittipaldi was born on 12 December 1946 in São Paulo, Brazil. He is the younger son of prominent Italian-Brazilian motorsports journalist and radio commentator Wilson Fittipaldi Sr and his wife Józefa &quot;Juzy&quot; Wojciechowska, an immigrant from Saint Petersburg of Polish and Russian descent.

He was named after American author and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. Both of his parents had raced production cars shortly after World War II, and his father was responsible for the first Mil Milhas race in 1956, in São Paulo, having been inspired by the 1949 Italian Mille Miglia. Emerson, along with his brother Wilson, became motorsports enthusiasts as young children.

==Career history==
At age 14, Fittipaldi was racing motorcycles, and at 16, hydroplanes. While racing one day, his brother Wilson blew over at and landed upside down. Wilson was uninjured in the accident, but it prompted both Fittipaldi brothers to stop competing in boat racing and focus solely on racing land vehicles. In 1967, Fittipaldi won the 6 Hours of Interlagos in a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia at the age of 20, and a year later the 12 Hours of Porto Alegre.

The pair moved to racing Formula Vees, and built up a company with their parents. In his second season in single-seaters, Fittipaldi won the Brazilian Formula Vee title at age 21. He left for Europe in 1969, with the ambition to convince team owners of his talent in three months. After some podiums and his first victories in Formula Ford, Fittipaldi was first trained and then subsequently engaged by the Jim Russell Driving School Formula Three team. He won nine F3 races on the Jim Russell Lotus 59 in the MCD Lombard Championship to become the 1969 champion.

===Formula Two===
For , Fittipaldi moved up to F2 by joining the Lotus semi-works Team Bardahl campaigning Lotus 59B. With six finishes in the points and four on the podium, he ended the eight-race season in third place behind Clay Regazzoni and Derek Bell. While this result was very impressive for the newcomer to the series, the spotlight was on Fittipaldi that year because of his activities in Formula One instead.

===Formula One===
====Lotus (1970–1973)====
Based on the success of the Cosworth DFV engine and Lotus 49/49B cars in 1968, Team Lotus was enjoying the reputation as one of the top F1 teams with the inflow of sponsorship money, and Colin Chapman used the third seat on the team for championship races as the testing ground for younger drivers. This was in contrast to the team&#x27;s tradition to use non-championship F1 events for the purpose.

The third seat was given to Alex Soler-Roig in early 1970, and then to Fittipaldi starting with the British GP in July, with Jochen Rindt and John Miles as the regular seat holders. Fittipaldi scored a fourth place as the No. 3 driver at the next German GP where the No. 1 Jochen Rindt won, and the No. 2 John Miles retired.

Team Lotus plans for the season drastically changed when Jochen Rindt was killed at Monza in September and became the only driver to win the championship posthumously. John Miles also left the team, and Fittipaldi was promoted to be the Lotus No. 1 driver on his fifth F1 race at the United States GP with Reine Wisell and Pete Lovely as the teammates. Fittipaldi proved up to the task and won this first post-Rindt race for Lotus.

In his first full year as Lotus&#x27;s lead driver in 1971, Fittipaldi finished sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship as the team further developed the previous season&#x27;s Lotus 72. Armed with what was arguably the greatest Formula one design of all time, the Lotus 72D, Fittipaldi proved dominant in 1972 as he won five of 11 races and claimed the F1 Drivers&#x27; Championship.

At 25, he was then the youngest champion in F1 history. It appeared he might do it again in 1973. After three wins in four attempts with the 72D, he began to struggle in the new 72E that was unveiled mid-year. It resulted in the reverse of the previous year, with Stewart beating Fittipaldi for the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

====McLaren (1974–1975)====
Fittipaldi left Lotus to sign with the promising McLaren team. Driving the highly efficient McLaren M23, he had three victories in 1974, reached the podium four other times, and beat out Clay Regazzoni in a close battle for his second championship. The following season, he notched two more victories and four other podiums, but was second to a dominant Niki Lauda.

====Fittipaldi (1976–1980)====
However, at the height of his F1 success, Fittipaldi shocked everyone by leaving McLaren to race for older brother Wilson Fittipaldi&#x27;s Copersucar-sponsored Fittipaldi Automotive team.

He remained with the team for five seasons but only managed a best finish of second. Fittipaldi decided to retire from racing at the end of 1980. He has since said that his last two years in Formula One were very unhappy: &quot;I was too involved in the problems of trying to make the team work, and I neglected my marriage and my personal life&quot;, although at the time he cited the deaths of many of his colleagues as his reason. He was only 33, but had been racing in Formula One for a decade. He had failed to finish seven of the last ten races that year and had several times been outpaced by his Finnish teammate Keke Rosberg (a future champion himself). He moved into the management of the team alongside his brother. The team struggled on for another two years with minimal sponsorship, going into receivership at the end of 1982.

=== CART ===
After leaving F1 in 1980, Fittipaldi took time out from major racing for four years. In 1984, the 37-year-old Fittipaldi made his debut in the American CART series. He spent his first season acclimatising to IndyCars, driving for two teams before joining Patrick Racing as a replacement for Chip Ganassi, who had been seriously injured in the 1984 Michigan 500. The 1985 Michigan 500 marked Fittipaldi&#x27;s first victory in CART. Fittipaldi stayed five years with Patrick Racing, recording six victories and solid finishes in the overall standings.

In 1989 Fittipaldi had five wins, finished in the top five in every race he completed, and was the CART champion. Among his wins was a dominant performance in the 1989 Indianapolis 500 where he led 158 of 200 laps and won by two laps, but only after a dramatic duel with Al Unser Jr. in the closing laps of the race. Unser ran down Fittipaldi after a late-race restart and passed him for the lead on lap 196. Three laps later, Fittipaldi used lapped traffic to his advantage to pull alongside Unser on the backstretch. Neither driver would give way, and the two cars touched wheels as they went through turn three side by side. Unser&#x27;s car spun out of control to hit the outside wall, while Fittipaldi was able to maintain sufficient control to keep his car moving straight. In spite of the altercation, Unser applauded Fittipaldi from the infield as Fittipaldi passed by on the final lap.

Roger Penske hired Fittipaldi for his racing team in 1990 and he continued to be among the top drivers in CART, winning at least one race with Penske for six straight years. But for bad luck he might have won three consecutive Indianapolis 500s, suffering blistered tires in 1990 and a gearbox failure in 1991, both while leading. In 1993 he added a second Indianapolis 500 victory by taking the lead from reigning Formula One World Champion Nigel Mansell on lap 185 and holding it for the remainder.

The race saw him break Indianapolis victory lane tradition when he drank a celebratory bottle of orange juice before the traditional bottle of milk. He was only the second driver to not drink milk at Indianapolis since the tradition was founded in 1936 (and firmly established in 1956). Fittipaldi owned several orange groves in his native Brazil, and wanted to promote the citrus industry. Fan reaction was negative to the break in tradition despite the fact that Fittipaldi did drink milk shortly after. As a result of drinking the juice, Fittipaldi forfeited $5,000 from the winner&#x27;s purse and publicly apologized to the American Dairy Association.

Fan reaction to the milk snub was highly negative, and he was booed a week later at Milwaukee, a center of the American dairy industry. In the years that followed, many fans continued to hold the action against him. In interviews since, Fittipaldi explained his action, and apologised for the wave of negativity that followed. Fittipaldi returned to Indianapolis to drive the Chevrolet Corvette Pace Car for the 2008 Indianapolis 500. Despite the passage of 15 years, he was again booed and heckled by some fans during the parade laps.

In May 1994, Fittipaldi skipped a practice session for the Indianapolis 500 after his close friend Ayrton Senna, also a native of Brazil and a former Formula One champion, died in a crash. Fittipaldi was one of the pallbearers during Senna&#x27;s funeral, alongside Jackie Stewart, Alain Prost and several other F1 world champions. Fittipaldi nearly won his third 500 but clipped the turn 4 wall with 15 laps to go while he was holding a nearly full lap lead over teammate Unser Jr.

Approaching 50, Fittipaldi was still driving in CART in 1996 when an injury at Michigan International Speedway ended his career. Fittipaldi did not return to the series as a driver after the injury. Fittipaldi finished his CART career with 22 wins. In 2003 he made a return to CART as a team owner.

Fittipaldi was the acting team principal for the Brazilian A1 GP entry. In 2005 Fittipaldi made a surprise return to competitive racing in the Grand Prix Masters event held at Kyalami in South Africa, finishing second behind fellow F1 driver Nigel Mansell.

In 2008, Emerson and his brother Wilson entered the Brazilian GT3 Championship, driving a Porsche 997 GT3 for the WB Motorsports team. In 2011, he started embracing social media and became a Chairman of Motorsport.com. In 2013 he began writing a regular monthly blog column on the official website of McLaren.

===Awards===
*He was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001.
*Fittipaldi was inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Fittipaldi is the younger brother of former Formula One driver and team owner Wilson Fittipaldi. He is the uncle of TUDOR United Sports Car Championship driver Christian Fittipaldi. He was married to Maria Helena from 1970-82. They had three children. He was married a second time, to Teresa, in the mid-1980s. They have two children.

In early December 2012, Fittipaldi married economist Rossana Fanucchi in São Paulo after a partnership of eleven years. They have a son, Emerson Jr., born in 2007, and daughter Vittoria, born in early 2012. Emerson Jr. competed in the 2021 F4 Danish Championship, finishing third overall.

His daughter Tatiana married racing driver Max Papis. They have two children, Marco Papis and Matteo Papis; Emerson&#x27;s grandsons.

His daughter Juliana had two sons and a daughter with Carlos da Cruz, Pietro, Enzo and Valentina Fittipaldi. Pietro and Enzo are also racing drivers, with Enzo being announced as a member of the Red Bull Junior Team in November 2022. Pietro made his Formula 1 debut at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix driving for the Haas F1 Team. For 2024, he signed to run a full IndyCar schedule with Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing.

===Life===
In September 1997, while recovering from injuries in a crash at Michigan International Speedway a year earlier, he was flying his private plane across his orange tree farm in the state of São Paulo. The plane lost power and plunged to the ground, leaving him with serious back injuries. Though Fittipaldi had converted to Christianity the year prior, his beliefs were reinforced after the crash. Fittipaldi is a Protestant in the Presbyterian tradition.

He was a friend of Beatles guitarist George Harrison and was with him shortly before Harrison died in November 2001.

In 2016, Fittipaldi established Fittipaldi Motors and, along with Pininfarina and HWA AG, created his first sports car project, the Fittipaldi EF7, though the car never entered production.

In August 2022, Fittipaldi announced his candidacy for the Italian Senate, representing the South American overseas constituency, running as a member of the Brothers of Italy political party, being eventually defeated by Italo-Argentine Mario Borghese a month later in the 2022 Italian parliamentary elections.

<text>The Melbourne Museum is a natural and cultural history museum located in the Carlton Gardens in Melbourne, Australia.

Located adjacent to the Royal Exhibition Building, the museum was opened in 2000 as a project of the Government of Victoria, on behalf of Museums Victoria which administers the venue.

The museum won Best Tourist Attraction at the Australian Tourism Awards in 2011.

In addition to its galleries, the museum features spaces such as &quot;Curious?&quot;, which is a place to meet staff and find answers relating to the collections, research, and behind-the-scenes work of Museums Victoria; as well as a cafe and a gift shop. The back-of-house area houses some of the Victoria&#x27;s State Collections, which holds over 17 million items, including objects relating to Indigenous Australian and Pacific Islander cultures, geology, historical studies, palaeontology, technology and society, and zoology, as well as a library collection that holds 18th and 19th century scientific monographs and serials. The world&#x27;s second largest IMAX theatre screen, which is also part of the museum complex, shows movies and documentary films in large-screen 3-D format.

== Architecture ==
The Melbourne Museum is a post-modernist building designed by Denton Corker Marshall architects. Construction at the current address was managed by Baulderstone Hornibrook and completed in 2001, with the museum&#x27;s official opening in 2000. 

The building can be dissected into different spaces so an individual can navigate the building in an orthogonal manner. It is designed as both a single building and a network of individual buildings integrated into the landscape of the Carlton Gardens.

The museum is axially aligned with the adjacent Italianate Royal Exhibition Building and references it, along with the skyscrapers of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district. The sticks and blades that make up the Melbourne Museum are hallmarks of Denton Corker Marshall&#x27;s architecture.

The most prominent element of the building are the two very long, very high, sloping canopies (or blades) that rise up from the centrally placed entrance opposite the north door of the Royal Exhibition Building; each act to guide visitors from the street into the museum. On the northern side of the building, another larger blade-like roof rises up from the centre to the north, on a similar scale to the central Florentine dome of the Royal Exhibition building.

The Melbourne Museum is situated in a precinct adjacent to a large local landmark within a large public park. Contrasted against the neo-classical Royal Exhibition centre, the museum is separated by an events plaza, yet the two are connected underground with a car park. The museum refers to Melbourne&#x27;s city grid in its planning, and integrates the landscape of Carlton Gardens, housing a Forest Gallery which is situated within the building, and also providing areas of exterior circulation around the building.

== History ==
=== 1854–2000: La Trobe Street ===
The museum had its earliest beginnings in the Government Assay Office, which on 9 March 1854, opened some displays in La Trobe Street. In 1858, Prof. Frederick McCoy (Sir Frederick from 1891), who was a professor of natural history at the University of Melbourne, was appointed Director of the National Museum.

Melbourne Museum was originally located (along with the State Library and the old state gallery) in the city block between La Trobe, Swanston, Little Lonsdale and Russell Streets - the nearby Museum underground railway station was originally named after it, although following the move, the station was renamed Melbourne Central. The State Library now uses all the space in that building, the gallery also having moved to the National Gallery of Victoria site on St Kilda Road.

The period in which the Victorian government was led by Rupert Hamer (1972–1981) was one of policy development for museums in Victoria. Hamer&#x27;s Arts Minister Norman Lacy established a Museums Development Committee consisting of representatives of the Science Museum of Victoria, the National Museum of Victoria and the Ministry for the Arts. It considered such matters as the development of a single City Museum complex (leading eventually to the establishment of the new Melbourne Museum in Carlton) and programs in fields such as social history. The committee also joined with a working party of the Victorian Council of the Arts to develop a comprehensive museums policy for Victoria. Lacy also began the establishment of the Heide Museum of Modern Art with the acquisition of the property Heide II (in Bulleen, east of Melbourne) and a collection of 113 art works from John and Sunday Reed in August 1980. It was officially opened in November 1981. He also developed a proposal for a Museum of Social and Political History at the Old Treasury Building for the Executive Committee of Victoria&#x27;s 150th Anniversary Celebrations in July 1981 which led to the establishment of the City Museum.

=== 2000–present: Carlton Gardens ===
The current Melbourne Museum is located in Carlton Gardens, alongside the Exhibition Building, on the site of the former Melbourne Exhibition Speedway, which operated from 5 November 1928 until 7 March 1936. The museum was constructed during the period of the Kennett government (1992–1999) and was opened on 21 October 2000 by the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks. The new Melbourne Museum included some living organisms within the galleries. The centrepiece of the new building houses the Forest Gallery, an exhibition portraying the temperate forests of eastern Victoria. The Forest Gallery is home to the ongoing Forest Secrets exhibition, which examines the agents of change within the forests.

The Melbourne Museum was one of the venues of Festival Melbourne 2006, a citywide art festival held in conjunction of the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which was held in Melbourne. Among the exhibitions held in the museum were &#x27;Common Goods:Cultures Meet Through Craft&#x27;, a project of the South Project. It featured crafts made by artists from various Commonwealth countries and &#x27;CARVE:Indigenous carving practices&#x27;, a series of demonstrations of traditional indigenous carving practices and techniques from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. There was also a producers&#x27; market, &#x27;Victorian Producers&#x27; Market&#x27;, where produces from regional Victoria such as wine, cheese and others were sold. A cooking competition, &#x27;Culinary Pro Am of the Commonwealth&#x27; was also held between Melbourne chefs, each representing a Commonwealth country. Live actions of the Games were also shown on a large screen on the museum grounds.

<text>Terence Kemp McKenna (November 16, 1946–April 3, 2000) was an American ethnobotanist and mystic who advocated for the responsible use of naturally occurring psychedelic plants. He spoke and wrote about a variety of subjects, including psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, philosophy, culture, technology, ethnomycology, environmentalism, and the theoretical origins of human consciousness. He was called the &quot;Timothy Leary of the &#x27;90s&quot;, &quot;one of the leading authorities on the ontological foundations of shamanism&quot;, and the &quot;intellectual voice of rave culture&quot;.

McKenna formulated a concept about the nature of time based on fractal patterns he claimed to have discovered in the &quot;I Ching&quot;, which he called novelty theory, proposing that this predicted the end of time, and a transition of consciousness in the year 2012. His promotion of novelty theory and its connection to the Maya calendar is credited as one of the factors leading to the widespread beliefs about the 2012 phenomenon. Novelty theory is considered pseudoscience.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Terence McKenna was born and raised in Paonia, Colorado,
with Irish ancestry on his father&#x27;s side of the family.

McKenna developed a hobby of fossil-hunting in his youth and from this he acquired a deep scientific appreciation of nature. He also became interested in psychology at a young age, reading Carl Jung&#x27;s book &quot;Psychology and Alchemy&quot; at the age of 14. This was the same age McKenna first became aware of magic mushrooms, when reading an essay titled &quot;Seeking the Magic Mushroom&quot; which appeared in the May 13, 1957 edition of LIFE magazine.

At age 16 McKenna moved to Los Altos, California to live with family friends for a year. He finished high school in Lancaster, California. In 1963, he was introduced to the literary world of psychedelics through &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; and &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; by Aldous Huxley and certain issues of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; which published articles on psychedelics.

McKenna said that one of his early psychedelic experiences with morning glory seeds showed him &quot;that there was something there worth pursuing&quot;, and in interviews he claimed to have smoked cannabis daily since his teens.

===Studying and traveling===
In 1965, McKenna enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley and was accepted into the Tussman Experimental College. While in college in 1967 he began studying shamanism through the study of Tibetan folk religion. That same year, which he called his &quot;opium and kabbala phase&quot;, he traveled to Jerusalem where he met Kathleen Harrison, an ethnobotanist who later became his wife.

In 1969, McKenna traveled to Nepal led by his interest in Tibetan painting and hallucinogenic shamanism. He sought out shamans of the Tibetan Bon tradition, trying to learn more about the shamanic use of visionary plants. During his time there, he also studied the Tibetan language and worked as a hashish smuggler, until &quot;one of his Bombay-to-Aspen shipments fell into the hands of U. S. Customs.&quot; He then wandered through southeast Asia viewing ruins, and spent time as a professional butterfly collector in Indonesia.

After his mother&#x27;s death from cancer in 1970, McKenna, his brother Dennis, and three friends traveled to the Colombian Amazon in search of &quot;oo-koo-hé&quot;, a plant preparation containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Instead of oo-koo-hé they found fields full of gigantic &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; mushrooms, which became the new focus of the expedition. In La Chorrera, at the urging of his brother, McKenna was the subject of a psychedelic experiment in which the brothers attempted to &quot;bond harmine DNA with their own neural DNA&quot; (harmine is another psychedelic compound they used synergistically with the mushrooms), through the use of a set specific vocal techniques. They hypothesised this would give them access to the collective memory of the human species, and would manifest the alchemists&#x27; Philosopher&#x27;s Stone which they viewed as a &quot;hyperdimensional union of spirit and matter&quot;. McKenna claimed the experiment put him in contact with &quot;Logos&quot;: an informative, divine voice he believed was universal to visionary religious experience. McKenna also often referred to the voice as &quot;the mushroom&quot;, and &quot;the teaching voice&quot; amongst other names. The voice&#x27;s reputed revelations and his brother&#x27;s simultaneous peculiar psychedelic experience prompted him to explore the structure of an early form of the &quot;I Ching&quot;, which led to his &quot;Novelty Theory&quot;.
During their stay in the Amazon, McKenna also became romantically involved with his interpreter, Ev.

In 1972, McKenna returned to U.C. Berkeley to finish his studies and in 1975, he graduated with a degree in ecology, shamanism, and conservation of natural resources. In the autumn of 1975, after parting with his girlfriend Ev earlier in the year, McKenna began a relationship with his future wife and the mother of his two children, Kathleen Harrison.

Soon after graduating, McKenna and Dennis published a book inspired by their Amazon experiences, &quot;The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching&quot;. The brothers&#x27; experiences in the Amazon were the main focus of McKenna&#x27;s book &quot;True Hallucinations&quot;, published in 1993. McKenna also began lecturing locally around Berkeley and started appearing on some underground radio stations.

===Psilocybin mushroom cultivation===

McKenna, along with his brother Dennis, developed a technique for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms using spores they brought to America from the Amazon. In 1976, the brothers published what they had learned in the book &quot;Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower&#x27;s Guide&quot;, under the pseudonyms &quot;O.T. Oss&quot; and &quot;O.N. Oeric&quot;. McKenna and his brother were the first to come up with a reliable method for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms at home. As ethnobiologist Jonathan Ott explains, &quot;[the] authors adapted San Antonio&#x27;s technique (for producing edible mushrooms by casing mycelial cultures on a rye grain substrate; San Antonio 1971) to the production of &quot;Psilocybe [Stropharia] cubensis&quot;. The new technique involved the use of ordinary kitchen implements, and for the first time the layperson was able to produce a potent entheogen in his [or her] own home, without access to sophisticated technology, equipment, or chemical supplies.&quot; When the 1986 revised edition was published, the &quot;Magic Mushroom Grower&#x27;s Guide&quot; had sold over 100,000 copies.

===Mid- to later life===

====Public speaking====
In the early 1980s, McKenna began to speak publicly on the topic of psychedelic drugs, becoming one of the pioneers of the psychedelic movement. His main focus was on the plant-based psychedelics such as psilocybin mushrooms (which were the catalyst for his career), ayahuasca, cannabis, and the plant derivative DMT. He conducted lecture tours and workshops promoting natural psychedelics as a way to explore universal mysteries, stimulate the imagination, and re-establish a harmonious relationship with nature. Though associated with the New Age and Human Potential Movements, McKenna himself had little patience for New Age sensibilities. He repeatedly stressed the importance and primacy of the &quot;felt presence of direct experience&quot;, as opposed to dogma.

In addition to psychedelic drugs, McKenna spoke on a wide array of subjects, including shamanism; metaphysics; alchemy; language; culture; self-empowerment; environmentalism, techno-paganism; artificial intelligence; evolution; extraterrestrials; science and scientism; the Web; and virtual reality.

McKenna soon became a fixture of popular counterculture with Timothy Leary once introducing him as &quot;one of the five or six most important people on the planet&quot; and with comedian Bill Hicks&#x27; referencing him in his stand-up act and building an entire routine around his ideas. McKenna also became a popular personality in the psychedelic rave/dance scene of the early 1990s, with frequent spoken word performances at raves and contributions to psychedelic and goa trance albums by The Shamen, Spacetime Continuum, Alien Project, Capsula, Entheogenic, Zuvuya, Shpongle, and Shakti Twins. In 1994 he appeared as a speaker at the Starwood Festival, documented in the book &quot;Tripping&quot; by Charles Hayes.

McKenna published several books in the early-to-mid-1990s including: &quot;The Archaic Revival&quot;; &quot;Food of the Gods&quot;; and &quot;True Hallucinations&quot;. Hundreds of hours of McKenna&#x27;s public lectures were recorded either professionally or bootlegged and have been produced on cassette tape, CD and MP3. Segments of his talks have gone on to be sampled by many musicians and DJ&#x27;s.

McKenna was a colleague and close friend of chaos mathematician Ralph Abraham, and author and biologist Rupert Sheldrake. He conducted several public and many private debates with them from 1982 until his death. These debates were known as &quot;trialogues&quot; and some of the discussions were later published in the books: &quot;Trialogues at the Edge of the West&quot; and &quot;The Evolutionary Mind&quot;.

====Botanical Dimensions====

In 1985, McKenna founded Botanical Dimensions with his then-wife, Kathleen Harrison. Botanical Dimensions is a nonprofit ethnobotanical preserve on the Big Island of Hawaii, established to collect, protect, propagate, and understand plants of ethno-medical significance and their lore, and appreciate, study, and educate others about plants and mushrooms felt to be significant to cultural integrity and spiritual well-being. The botanical garden is a repository containing thousands of plants that have been used by indigenous people of the tropical regions, and includes a database of information related to their purported healing properties. McKenna was involved until 1992, when he retired from the project, following his and Kathleen&#x27;s divorce earlier in the year. Kathleen still manages Botanical Dimensions as its president and projects director.

After their divorce, McKenna moved to Hawaii permanently, where he built a modernist house and created a gene bank of rare plants near his home. Previously, he had split his time between Hawaii and Occidental, CA.

===Death===
McKenna was a longtime sufferer of migraines, but on 22 May 1999 he began to have unusually extreme and painful headaches. He then collapsed due to a seizure. McKenna was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. For the next several months he underwent various treatments, including experimental gamma knife radiation treatment. According to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, McKenna was worried that his tumor may have been caused by his psychedelic drug use, or his 35 years of daily cannabis smoking; however, his doctors assured him there was no causal relation.

In late 1999, McKenna described his thoughts concerning his impending death to interviewer Erik Davis:

McKenna died on April 3, 2000, at the age of 53.

===Library fire and insect collection===
McKenna&#x27;s library of over 3,000 rare books and personal notes was destroyed in a fire in Monterey, California on February 7, 2007. An index of McKenna&#x27;s library was preserved by his brother Dennis.

McKenna studied Lepidoptera and entomology in the 1960s, and his studies included hunting for butterflies, primarily in Colombia and Indonesia, creating a large collection of insect specimens. After McKenna&#x27;s death, his daughter, the artist and photographer Klea McKenna, preserved his insect collection, turning it into a gallery installation, then publishing &quot;The Butterfly Hunter&quot;, a book of 122 insect photos from a set of over 2,000 specimens McKenna collected between 1969 and 1972, alongside maps of his collecting routes through rainforests in Southeast Asia and South America. McKenna&#x27;s insect collection was consistent with his interest in Victorian-era explorers and naturalists, and his worldview based on close observation of nature. In the 1970s, when he was still collecting, he became quite squeamish and guilt-ridden about the necessity of killing butterflies in order to collect and classify them, according to McKenna&#x27;s daughter, this led him to cease his entomological studies.

==Thought==

===Psychedelics===
Terence McKenna advocated the exploration of altered states of mind via the ingestion of naturally occurring psychedelic substances; for example, and in particular, as facilitated by the ingestion of high doses of psychedelic mushrooms, ayahuasca, and DMT, which he believed was the apotheosis of the psychedelic experience.
He was less enthralled with synthetic drugs, stating, &quot;I think drugs should come from the natural world and be use-tested by shamanically orientated cultures ... one cannot predict the long-term effects of a drug produced in a laboratory.&quot;

McKenna always stressed the responsible use of psychedelic plants, saying: &quot;Experimenters should be very careful. One must build up to the experience. These are bizarre dimensions of extraordinary power and beauty. There is no set rule to avoid being overwhelmed, but move carefully, reflect a great deal, and always try to map experiences back onto the history of the race and the philosophical and religious accomplishments of the species. All the compounds are potentially dangerous, and all compounds, at sufficient doses or repeated over time, involve risks. The library is the first place to go when looking into taking a new compound.&quot;

He also recommended, and often spoke of taking, what he called &quot;heroic doses&quot;, which he defined as five grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms, taken alone, on an empty stomach, in silent darkness, and with eyes closed. He believed that when taken this way one could expect a profound visionary experience, believing it is only when &quot;slain&quot; by the power of the mushroom that the message becomes clear.

Although McKenna avoided giving his allegiance to any one interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open to the idea of psychedelics as being &quot;trans-dimensional travel&quot;. He proposed that DMT sent one to a &quot;parallel dimension&quot; and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter &quot;higher dimensional entities&quot;, or what could be ancestors, or spirits of the Earth, saying that if you can trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an &quot;ecology of souls&quot;. McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were &quot;doorways into the Gaian mind&quot;, suggesting that &quot;the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being&quot; and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication.

====Machine elves====

McKenna spoke of hallucinations while on DMT in which he claims to have met intelligent entities he described as &quot;self-transforming machine elves&quot;.

====Psilocybin panspermia speculation====

In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick&#x27;s hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that &quot;intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [to Earth] in this spore-bearing life form&quot;. He said, &quot;I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I think in a hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure,&quot; and also believed that &quot;few people are in a position to judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed&quot;.

====Opposition to organized religion====
McKenna was opposed to Christianity and most forms of organized religion or guru-based forms of spiritual awakening, favouring shamanism, which he believed was the broadest spiritual paradigm available, stating that:
What I think happened is that in the world of prehistory all religion was experiential, and it was based on the pursuit of ecstasy through plants. And at some time, very early, a group interposed itself between people and direct experience of the &#x27;Other.&#x27; This created hierarchies, priesthoods, theological systems, castes, ritual, taboos. Shamanism, on the other hand, is an experiential science that deals with an area where we know nothing. It is important to remember that our epistemological tools have developed very unevenly in the West. We know a tremendous amount about what is going on in the heart of the atom, but we know absolutely nothing about the nature of the mind.

====Technological singularity====
During the final years of his life and career, McKenna became very engaged in the theoretical realm of technology. He was an early proponent of the technological singularity and in his last recorded public talk, &quot;Psychedelics in the age of intelligent machines&quot;, he outlined ties between psychedelics, computation technology, and humans. He also became enamored with the Internet, calling it &quot;the birth of [the] global mind&quot;, believing it to be a place where psychedelic culture could flourish.

====Admired writers====
Either philosophically or religiously, he expressed admiration for Marshall McLuhan, Alfred North Whitehead, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Carl Jung, Plato, Gnostic Christianity, and Alchemy, while regarding the Greek philosopher Heraclitus as his favorite philosopher.

McKenna also expressed admiration for the works of writers Aldous Huxley, James Joyce, whose book &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; he called &quot;the quintessential work of art, or at least work of literature of the 20th century,&quot; science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who he described as an &quot;incredible genius&quot;, fabulist Jorge Luis Borges, with whom McKenna shared the belief that &quot;scattered through the ordinary world there are books and artifacts and perhaps people who are like doorways into impossible realms, of impossible and contradictory truth&quot; and Vladimir Nabokov. McKenna once said that he would have become a Nabokov lecturer if he had never encountered psychedelics.

===&quot;Stoned ape&quot; theory of human evolution ===

McKenna&#x27;s hypothesis concerning the influence of psilocybin mushrooms on human evolution is known as &quot;the &#x27;stoned ape&#x27; theory.&quot;

In his 1992 book &quot;Food of the Gods&quot;, McKenna proposed that the transformation from humans&#x27; early ancestors &quot;Homo erectus&quot; to the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; mainly involved the addition of the mushroom &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; in the diet, an event that according to his theory took place about 100,000 BCE (when he believed humans diverged from the genus &quot;Homo&quot;). McKenna based his theory on the effects, or alleged effects, produced by the mushroom while citing studies by Roland Fischer et al. from the late 1960s to early 1970s.

McKenna stated that, due to the desertification of the African continent at that time, human forerunners were forced from the shrinking tropical canopy into search of new food sources. He believed they would have been following large herds of wild cattle whose dung harbored the insects that, he proposed, were undoubtedly part of their new diet, and would have spotted and started eating &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;, a dung-loving mushroom often found growing out of cowpats.

McKenna&#x27;s hypothesis was that low doses of psilocybin improve visual acuity, particularly edge detection, meaning that the presence of psilocybin in the diet of early pack hunting primates caused the individuals who were consuming psilocybin mushrooms to be better hunters than those who were not, resulting in an increased food supply and in turn a higher rate of reproductive success. Then at slightly higher doses, he contended, the mushroom acts to sexually arouse, leading to a higher level of attention, more energy in the organism, and potential erection in the males, rendering it even more evolutionarily beneficial, as it would result in more offspring. At even higher doses, McKenna proposed that the mushroom would have acted to &quot;dissolve boundaries&quot;, promoting community bonding and group sexual activities. Consequently, there would be a mixing of genes, greater genetic diversity, and a communal sense of responsibility for the group offspring. At these higher doses, McKenna also argued that psilocybin would be triggering activity in the &quot;language-forming region of the brain&quot;, manifesting as music and visions, thus catalyzing the emergence of language in early hominids by expanding &quot;their arboreally evolved repertoire of troop signals&quot;. He also pointed out that psilocybin would dissolve the ego and &quot;religious concerns would be at the forefront of the tribe&#x27;s consciousness, simply because of the power and strangeness of the experience itself.&quot;

According to McKenna, access to and ingestion of mushrooms was an evolutionary advantage to humans&#x27; omnivorous hunter-gatherer ancestors, also providing humanity&#x27;s first religious impulse. He believed that psilocybin mushrooms were the &quot;evolutionary catalyst&quot; from which language, projective imagination, the arts, religion, philosophy, science, and all of human culture sprang.

====Criticism====
McKenna&#x27;s &quot;stoned ape&quot; theory has not received attention from the scientific community and has been criticized for a relative lack of citation to any of the paleoanthropological evidence informing our understanding of human origins. His ideas regarding psilocybin and visual acuity have been criticized as misrepresentations of Fischer et al.&#x27;s findings, who published studies of visual perception parameters other than acuity. Criticism has also noted a separate study on psilocybin-induced transformation of visual space, wherein Fischer et al. stated that psilocybin &quot;may not be conducive to the survival of the organism&quot;. There is a lack of scientific evidence that psilocybin increases sexual arousal, and even if it does, it would not necessarily entail an evolutionary advantage. Others have pointed to civilizations such as the Aztecs, who used psychedelic mushrooms (at least among the Priestly class), that did not reflect McKenna&#x27;s model of how psychedelic-using cultures would behave, for example, by carrying out human sacrifice. There are also examples of Amazonian tribes such as the Jivaro and the Yanomami who use ayahuasca ceremoniously and who are known to engage in violent behaviour. This, it has been argued, indicates the use of psychedelic plants does not necessarily suppress the ego and create harmonious societies.

===Archaic revival===
One of the main themes running through McKenna&#x27;s work, and the title of his second book, was the idea that Western civilization was undergoing what he called an &quot;archaic revival&quot;.

His hypothesis was that Western society has become &quot;sick&quot; and is undergoing a &quot;healing process&quot;: In the same way that the human body begins to produce antibodies when it feels itself to be sick, humanity as a collective whole (in the Jungian sense) was creating &quot;strategies for overcoming the condition of disease&quot; and trying to cure itself, by what he termed as &quot;a reversion to archaic values&quot;. McKenna pointed to phenomena including surrealism, abstract expressionism, body piercing and tattooing, psychedelic drug use, sexual permissiveness, jazz, experimental dance, rave culture, rock and roll and catastrophe theory, amongst others, as his evidence that this process was underway. This idea is linked to McKenna&#x27;s &quot;stoned ape&quot; theory of human evolution, with him viewing the &quot;archaic revival&quot; as an impulse to return to the symbiotic and blissful relationship he believed humanity once had with the psilocybin mushroom.

In differentiating his idea from the &quot;New Age&quot;, a term that he felt trivialized the significance of the next phase in human evolution, McKenna stated that: &quot;The New Age is essentially humanistic psychology &#x27;80s-style, with the addition of neo-shamanism, channeling, crystal and herbal healing. The archaic revival is a much larger, more global phenomenon that assumes that we are recovering the social forms of the late neolithic, and reaches far back in the 20th century to Freud, to surrealism, to abstract expressionism, even to a phenomenon like National Socialism which is a negative force. But the stress on ritual, on organized activity, on race/ancestor-consciousness – these are themes that have been worked out throughout the entire 20th century, and the archaic revival is an expression of that.&quot;

===Novelty theory and Timewave Zero===

Novelty theory is a pseudoscientific idea that purports to predict the ebb and flow of novelty in the universe as an inherent quality of time, proposing that time is not a constant but has various qualities tending toward either &quot;habit&quot; or &quot;novelty&quot;. Habit, in this context, can be thought of as entropic, repetitious, or conservative; and novelty as creative, disjunctive, or progressive phenomena. McKenna&#x27;s idea was that the universe is an engine designed for the production and conservation of novelty and that as novelty increases, so does complexity. With each level of complexity achieved becoming the platform for a further ascent into complexity.

The basis of the theory was conceived in the mid-1970s after McKenna&#x27;s experiences with psilocybin mushrooms at La Chorrera in the Amazon led him to closely study the King Wen sequence of the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

In Asian Taoist philosophy, opposing phenomena are represented by the yin and yang. Both are always present in everything, yet the amount of influence of each varies over time. The individual lines of the &quot;I Ching&quot; are made up of both Yin (broken lines) and Yang (solid lines).

When examining the King Wen sequence of 64 hexagrams, McKenna noticed a pattern. He analysed the &quot;degree of difference&quot; between the hexagrams in each successive pair and claimed he found a statistical anomaly, which he believed suggested that the King Wen sequence was intentionally constructed, with the sequence of hexagrams ordered in a highly structured and artificial way, and that this pattern codified the nature of time&#x27;s flow in the world. With the degrees of difference as numerical values, McKenna worked out a mathematical wave form based on the 384 lines of change that make up the 64 hexagrams. He was able to graph the data and this became the &quot;Novelty Time Wave&quot;.

Peter J. Meyer (Peter Johann Gustav Meyer), in collaboration with McKenna, studied and developed novelty theory, working out a mathematical formula and developing the &quot;Timewave Zero&quot; software (the original version of which was completed by July 1987), enabling them to graph and explore its dynamics on a computer. The graph was fractal: It exhibited a pattern in which a given small section of the wave was found to be identical in form to a larger section of the wave. McKenna called this fractal modeling of time &quot;temporal resonance&quot;, proposing it implied that larger intervals, occurring long ago, contained the same amount of information as shorter, more recent, intervals. He suggested the up-and-down oscillation of the wave shows an ongoing wavering between habit and novelty respectively. With each successive iteration trending, at an increasing level, towards infinite novelty. So according to novelty theory, the pattern of time itself is speeding up, with a requirement of the theory being that infinite novelty will be reached on a specific date.

McKenna believed that events in history could be identified that would help him locate the time wave end date and attempted to find the best-fit of the graph to the data field of human history. The last harmonic of the wave has a duration of 67.29 years. Population growth, peak oil, and pollution statistics were some of the factors that pointed him to an early twenty-first century end date and when looking for a particularly novel event in human history as a signal that the final phase had begun McKenna picked the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. This adjusted his graph to reach zero in mid-November 2012. When he later discovered that the end of the 13th baktun in the Maya calendar had been correlated by Western Maya scholars as December 21, 2012, he adopted their end date instead.

McKenna saw the universe, in relation to novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor at the end of time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as &quot;the transcendental object at the end of time.&quot; When describing this model of the universe he stated that: &quot;The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll down the side of the bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That&#x27;s precisely my model of human history. I&#x27;m suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor.&quot; Therefore, according to McKenna&#x27;s final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012, we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a &quot;concrescence&quot;, a &quot;tightening &#x27;gyre&#x27;&quot; with everything flowing together. Speculating that &quot;when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into physis as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into &#x27;hyperspace&#x27;, but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination.&quot;

Novelty theory is considered to be pseudoscience. Among the criticisms are the use of numerology to derive dates of important events in world history, the arbitrary rather than calculated end date of the time wave and the apparent adjustment of the eschaton from November 2012 to December 2012 in order to coincide with the Maya calendar. Other purported dates do not fit the actual time frames: the date claimed for the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is inaccurate by 70,000 years, and the existence of the ancient Sumer and Egyptian civilisations contradict the date he gave for the beginning of &quot;historical time&quot;. Some projected dates have been criticized for having seemingly arbitrary labels, such as the &quot;height of the age of mammals&quot; and McKenna&#x27;s analysis of historical events has been criticised for having a eurocentric and cultural bias.

====The Watkins Objection====
The British mathematician Matthew Watkins of Exeter University conducted a mathematical analysis of the &quot;Time Wave&quot;, and claimed there were mathematical flaws in its construction.

==Critical reception==
Judy Corman, vice president of the Phoenix House of New York, attacked McKenna for popularizing &quot;dangerous substances&quot;. In a 1993 letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he wrote that: &quot;surely the fact that Terence McKenna says that the psilocybin mushroom &#x27;is the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other to communicate with mankind&#x27; is enough for us to wonder if taking LSD has done something to his mental faculties.&quot; The same year, in his &quot;True Hallucinations&quot; review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Peter Conrad wrote: &quot;I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while reading his shrilly ecstatic prose&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Food of the Gods&quot;, Richard Evans Schultes wrote in &quot;American Scientist&quot; that the book was &quot;a masterpiece of research and writing&quot; and that it &quot;should be read by every specialist working in the multifarious fields involved with the use of psychoactive drugs&quot;. Concluding that, &quot;[i]t is, without question, destined to play a major role in our future considerations of the role of the ancient use of psychoactive drugs, the historical shaping of our modern concerns about drugs and perhaps about man&#x27;s desire for escape from reality with drugs.&quot;

In 1994, Tom Hodgkinson wrote for &quot;The New Statesman and Society&quot;, that &quot;to write him off as a crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not only full of fascinating ideas but also blessed with a sense of humor and self-parody&quot;.

In a 1992 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, Mark Jacobson wrote of &quot;True Hallucinations&quot; that, &quot;it would be hard to find a drug narrative more compellingly perched on a baroquely romantic limb than this passionate Tom-and-Huck-ride-great-mother-river-saga of brotherly bonding,&quot; adding &quot;put simply, Terence is a hoot!&quot;

&quot;Wired&quot; called him a &quot;charismatic talking head&quot; who was &quot;brainy, eloquent, and hilarious&quot;, and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead also said that he was &quot;the only person who has made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic experience&quot;.

<doc id="241686" wikidata="Q1855025" url="?curid=241686" title="Troll A platform">
<text>The Troll A platform is a Condeep gravity-based structure offshore natural gas platform in the Troll gas field off the west coast of Norway. Built from reinforced concrete, , it was the tallest structure that has ever been moved to another position, relative to the surface of the Earth, and is among the largest and most complex engineering projects in history. The platform was a televised sensation when it was towed into the North Sea in 1995, where it is now operated by Equinor. It is also the heaviest object moved and the object with the second highest displacement at 1.2 million tons(the object with the highest displacement is the Gullfaks C, which had a displacement approaching 1.5 million tons). Troll A was towed from the afternoon 10 May 1995 until the platform was in place 17 May 1995. It was lowered to the seabed in 303 meters of water, and had penetrated 36 meters into the soil by 19 May 1995. It was self-supporting with no further mooring required.

==Dimensions==
The Troll A platform has an overall height of , weighs 683,600 tons (1.2 million tons with ballast) and has the distinction of being the tallest structure ever moved by mankind. The platform stands on four legs extending down to the sea floor 303 meters (994 feet) below the surface of the sea, and the leg containing the import and export risers has an elevator that takes over nine minutes to travel from the platform above the waves to the sea floor.

The legs must be able to withstand intense pressures, so the walls of Troll A&#x27;s legs are over 1 metre thick and are made of steel-reinforced concrete that was formed in one continuous poura lengthy process that takes 20 minutes per 5 cm laid. Each leg is a mathematically joined composite of several conical cylinders that flares out smoothly to greater diameters at the top and bottom, so each support is somewhat wasp-waisted when viewed in profile and circular in any cross-section (see picture at right).

The four legs are joined by a &quot;chord shortener&quot; (not present in the picture at right), a reinforced concrete box connecting the legs that damps out any potentially destructive wave-leg resonances by retuning the legs&#x27; natural frequencies. Each leg is also sub-divided along its length into compartments a third of the way from each end which act as independent water-tight compartments. The legs use groups of six tall vacuum-anchors holding them fixed in the mud of the sea floor.

==Construction==
Troll A was built by Norwegian Contractors for Norske Shell, with base construction beginning in September 1991 at a cost of 4150 million NOK, or approximately US$650 million at the time. The base and the deck were built separately, and were joined in 1998 while the base was partially submerged. The base is a Condeep gravity base structure built from reinforced concrete.

The Troll platform was towed over from Vats, in the northern part of Rogaland, to the Troll field, north-west of Bergen. The tow took seven days.

==Expansion==
In the autumn of 2010 the Troll A platform was expanded with a new module. This module contains living quarters and a new control room. The new control room and expanded facilities are needed to support new compressors. These compressors are needed due to the dropping reservoir pressure in the wells.

On 18 June 2013 the new support module &quot;M12&quot; for compressors 3 and 4 was lifted on board Troll A. The increased electricity consumption of these compressors required new power cables from shore, and due to grid constraints the platform is cut off from shore power if a grid emergency arises.

==Operation==
Gas rises from 40 wells and is exported through a number of pipes to a processing plant at Kollsnes. Troll A is scheduled to receive two additional gas compressors to increase production volume and compensate for dropping reservoir pressure in the wells.

==World records==
In 1996, the platform set the Guinness World Record for the largest offshore gas platform.

In 2006, the 10th anniversary of Statoil&#x27;s operatorship of Troll gas production was celebrated with a concert by Katie Melua held at the base of one of the hollow legs of the platform. The concert set a new world record for the deepest underwater concert, at below sea level.

<doc id="241688" wikidata="Q1999649" url="?curid=241688" title="Submerged arc welding">
<text>Submerged arc welding (SAW) is a common arc welding process. The first SAW patent was taken out in 1935. The process requires a continuously fed consumable solid or tubular (metal cored) electrode. The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being &quot;submerged&quot; under a blanket of granular fusible flux consisting of lime, silica, manganese oxide, calcium fluoride, and other compounds. When molten, the flux becomes conductive, and provides a current path between the electrode and the work. This thick layer of flux completely covers the molten metal thus preventing spatter and sparks as well as suppressing the intense ultraviolet radiation and fumes that are a part of the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process.

SAW is normally operated in the automatic or mechanized mode, however, semi-automatic (hand-held) SAW guns with pressurized or gravity flux feed delivery are available. The process is normally limited to the flat or horizontal-fillet welding positions (although horizontal groove position welds have been done with a special arrangement to support the flux). Deposition rates approaching 45 kg/h (100 lb/h) have been reported — this compares to ~5 kg/h (10 lb/h) (max) for shielded metal arc welding. Although currents ranging from 300 to 2000 A are commonly utilized, currents of up to 5000 A have also been used (multiple arcs).

Single or multiple (2 to 5) electrode wire variations of the process exist. SAW strip-cladding utilizes a flat strip electrode (e.g. 60 mm wide x 0.5 mm thick). DC or AC power can be used, and combinations of DC and AC are common on multiple electrode systems. Constant voltage welding power supplies are most commonly used; however, constant current systems in combination with a voltage sensing wire-feeder are available.

==Features==
===Welding head===
It feeds flux and filler metal to the welding joint. The electrode (filler metal) gets energized here.

===Flux hopper===
It stores the flux and controls the rate of flux deposition on the welding joint.

===Flux===
The granulated flux shields and thus protects molten weld from atmospheric contamination. The flux cleans weld metal and can also modify its chemical composition. The flux is granulated to a definite size. It may be of fused, bonded or mechanically mixed type. The flux may consist of fluorides of calcium and oxides of calcium, magnesium, silicon, aluminium and manganese compounds. Alloying elements may be added as per requirements. Substances involving large amounts of gas during welding are never mixed with the flux. Flux with fine and coarse particle sizes are recommended for welding heavier and smaller thickness respectively.

===Electrode===
SAW filler material usually is a standard wire as well as other special forms. This wire normally has a thickness of 1.6 mm to 6 mm (1/16 in. to 1/4 in.). In certain circumstances, twisted wire can be used to give the arc an oscillating movement. This helps fuse the toe of the weld to the base metal. The electrode composition depends upon the material being welded. Alloying elements may be added in the electrodes. Electrodes are available to weld mild steels, high carbon steels, low and special alloy steels, stainless steel and some of the nonferrous of copper and nickel. Electrodes are generally copper coated to prevent rusting and to increase their electrical conductivity. Electrodes are available in straight lengths and coils. Their diameters may be 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 3, 4.0, 4.8, and 6.4 mm. The approximate value of currents to weld with 1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 mm diameter electrodes are 150–350, 250–800 and 650–1350 amps respectively.

==Welding Operation==
The flux starts depositing on the joint to be welded. Since the flux is not electrically conductive when cold, the arc may be struck either by touching the electrode with the work piece or by placing steel wool between electrode and job before switching on the welding current or by using a high frequency unit. In all cases the arc is struck under a cover of flux. Flux otherwise is an insulator but once it melts due to heat of the arc, it becomes highly conductive and hence the current flow is maintained between the electrode and the workpiece through the molten flux. The upper portion of the flux, in contact with atmosphere, which is visible remains granular (unchanged) and can be reused. The lower, melted flux becomes slag, which is waste material and must be removed after welding.

The electrode is continuously fed to the joint to be welded at a predetermined speed. In semi-automatic welding sets the welding head is moved manually along the joint. In automatic welding a separate drive moves either the welding head over the stationary job or the job moves/rotates under the stationary welding head.

The arc length is kept constant by using the principle of a self-adjusting arc. If the arc length decreases, arc voltage will increase, arc current and therefore burn-off rate will increase thereby causing the arc to lengthen. The reverse occurs if the arc length increases more than the normal.

A backing plate of steel or copper may be used to control penetration and to support large amounts of molten metal associated with the process.
===Key SAW process variables===
* Wire feed speed (main factor in welding current control)
* Arc voltage
* Travel speed
* Electrode stick-out (ESO) or contact tip to work (CTTW)
* Polarity and current type (AC or DC) and variable balance AC current

==Material applications==
* Carbon steels (structural and vessel construction)
* Low alloy steels
* Stainless steels
* Nickel-based alloys
* Surfacing applications (wear-facing, build-up, and corrosion resistant overlay of steels)

==Advantages==
* High deposition rates (over 45 kg/h (100 lb/h) have been reported).
* High operating factors in mechanized applications.
* Deep weld penetration.
* Sound welds are readily made (with good process design and control).
* High speed welding of thin sheet steels up to 5 m/min (16 ft/min) is possible.
* Welding fumes and arc flash is eliminated or minimized.
* Practically no edge preparation is necessary depending on joint configuration and required penetration.
* The process is suitable for both indoor and outdoor works.
* Welds produced are sound, uniform, ductile, corrosion resistant and have good impact value.
* Single pass welds can be made in thick plates with normal equipment.
* The arc is always covered under a blanket of flux, thus there is no chance of spatter of weld.
* 50% to 90% of the flux is recoverable, recycled and reused.

==Limitations==
* Limited to ferrous (steel or stainless steels) and some nickel-based alloys.
* Normally limited to the 1F, 1G, and 2F positions.
* Normally limited to long straight seams or rotated pipes or vessels.
* Requires relatively troublesome flux handling systems.
* Flux and slag residue can present a health and safety concern.
* Requires inter-pass and post weld slag removal.
* Requires backing strips for proper root penetration.
* Limited to high thickness materials.

<text>Kingsnakes are colubrid New World members of the genus Lampropeltis, which includes 26 species. Among these, about 45 subspecies are recognized. They are nonvenomous and ophiophagous in diet.

==Description==
Kingsnakes vary widely in size and coloration. They can be as small as 24&quot; (61 cm) or as long as 60&quot; (152 cm). Some kingsnakes are colored in muted browns to black, while others are brightly marked in white, reds, yellows, grays, and lavenders that form rings, longitudinal stripes, speckles, and saddle-shaped bands.

Most kingsnakes have quite vibrant patterns. Some species, such as the scarlet kingsnake, Mexican milk snake, and red milk snake, have coloration and patterning that can cause them to be confused with the highly venomous coral snakes. One of the mnemonic rhymes to help people distinguish between coral snakes and their nonvenomous lookalikes in the United States is &quot;red on black, a friend of Jack; red on yellow, kill a fellow&quot;. Other variations include &quot;red on yellow kill a fellow, red on black venom lack&quot;, and referencing the order of traffic lights &quot;yellow, red, stop!&quot; All these mnemonics apply only to the three species of coral snakes native to the southern United States: &quot;Micrurus fulvius&quot; (the eastern or common coral snake), &quot;Micrurus tener&quot; (the Texas coral snake), and &quot;Micruroides euryxanthus&quot; (the Arizona coral snake). Coral snakes found in other parts of the world can have distinctly different patterns, such as having red bands touching black bands, having only pink and blue bands, or having no bands at all.

==Etymology==
&quot;Lampropeltis&quot; includes the Greek words for &quot;shiny shield&quot;: (&quot;shiny&quot;) + (&quot;&quot;peltē&quot; shield&quot;) + (a Latin suffix). The name is given to them in reference to their smooth, enamel-like dorsal scales.

The &quot;king&quot; in the common name (as with the king cobra) refers to its preying on other snakes.

==Taxonomy==
Taxonomic reclassification of kingsnakes, as with many herpetiles and other animals, is a neverending process. Unexpected hybridization between kingsnake species and/or subspecies with adjacent home territories is not uncommon, thus creating new color morphs and variations, and further providing classification challenges for taxonomists; Often, different researchers will “agree to disagree”, one potentially citing a source that proves independent species-status to a group of wild snakes, while another will set out to prove that a discovered group is but a regional subspecies.

In the case of &quot;L. catalinensis&quot;, for example, only a single specimen is known, thus classification is not necessarily finite; this individual could be the lone uniquely-colored snake out of a more uniformly-colored litter, or even be the one documented example of a presently-unknown, localized subspecies. The entire system actively unfolding indefinitely.

==Range==
Kingsnakes are native to North America, where they are found all over the United States and into Mexico. This genus has adapted to a wide variety of habitats, including tropical forests, shrublands, and deserts. As a whole, kingsnakes are found coast-to-coast across North America, with some as far north as Montana, North Dakota, New Jersey, Illinois and Ohio; south of those areas, there are kingsnakes to be found in nearly every corner of the lower-48 United States. Kingsnakes are also found virtually coast-to-coast across México, all the way down to the México-Guatemala border. Further south from there, milksnakes become the more predominant kingsnake in Central America, such as the Honduran milk snake.

==Predators==
Kingsnakes are often preyed upon by large vertebrates, such as birds of prey. Tarantulas also sometimes prey on them; however, a considerable threat also comes from other kingsnakes. All species of kingsnakes are known snake- and reptile-eaters, and likely won&#x27;t turn down a chance to prey on their local competitors.

==Behavior and diet==
Kingsnakes are primarily terrestrial, but they are also known to be capable climbers and swimmers.

Kingsnakes use constriction to kill their prey and tend to be opportunistic in their diet. They are known to seek out and eat other snakes (ophiophagy), including venomous snakes, like rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, copperheads. Some known non-venomous prey species of the kingsnake include gopher snakes, corn snakes, hognoses, and bullsnakes, garter snakes, rosy boa, water snakes, and brown snakes. Kingsnakes also eat many species of lizards, rodents, birds, and eggs. The common kingsnake is known to be immune to the venom of other snakes and does eat rattlesnakes, but it is not necessarily immune to the venom of snakes from different localities.

Kingsnakes such as the California kingsnake can exert twice as much constriction force relative to body size as rat snakes and pythons. Scientists believe that such strong coils may be an adaptation to eating snakes, and other reptile prey, which can endure lower blood-oxygen levels before asphyxiating.

<text>Crossrail is a completed railway project centred on London. It provides a high-frequency hybrid commuter rail and rapid transit system, known as the Elizabeth line, that crosses the capital from suburbs on the west to east and connects two major railway lines terminating in London: the Great Western Main Line and the Great Eastern Main Line. The project was approved in 2007, and construction began in 2009 on the central section and connections to existing lines that became part of the route, which has been named the Elizabeth line in honour of Queen Elizabeth II who opened the line on 17 May 2022 during her Platinum Jubilee. The central section of the line between Paddington and Abbey Wood opened on 24 May 2022, with 12 trains per hour running in each direction through the core section in Central London.

The main feature of the project was the construction of a new railway line that runs underground from Paddington Station to a junction near Whitechapel. There it splits into a branch to , where it joins the Great Eastern Main Line; and a branch to Abbey Wood in southeast London.

When the Elizabeth line became fully operational in May 2023, the new nine-carriage Class 345 trains started to run at frequencies in the central section of up to 24 trains per hour in each direction through the central core, after which services divide into two branches: in the west to and to ; in the east to and to . Local services on the section of the Great Eastern Main Line between and Shenfield had been transferred to TfL Rail in May 2015; TfL Rail also took over Heathrow Connect services in May 2018 and replaced some local services between Paddington and Reading in December 2019. The TfL Rail brand was discontinued when the core section of the Elizabeth line opened in May 2022.

The Elizabeth line is operated by MTR Corporation (Crossrail) Ltd as a London Rail concession of Transport for London (TfL), in a similar manner to London Overground. TfL&#x27;s annual revenues from the line were forecast in 2018 to be nearly £500million in 2022–23 and over £1billion from 2024 to 2025.

The total estimated cost rose from an initial budget of £14.8billion to £18.8billion by December 2020. Originally planned to open in 2018, the project was repeatedly delayed, including several months caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

== History ==

=== Early proposals ===
The concept of large-diameter tunnels crossing central London to connect Paddington in the west and Liverpool Street in the east was first proposed by railwayman George Dow in &quot;The Star&quot; newspaper in June 1941. The project that became Crossrail has origins in the 1943 County of London Plan and 1944 Greater London Plan by Patrick Abercrombie. These led to a specialist investigation by the Railway (London Plan) Committee, appointed in 1944 and reporting in 1946 and 1948.

The term &quot;Crossrail&quot; emerged in the 1974 London Rail Study Report. Although the idea was seen as imaginative, only a brief estimate of cost was given: £300million. A feasibility study was recommended as a high priority so that the practicability and costs of the scheme could be determined. It was also suggested that the alignment of the tunnels should be safeguarded while a final decision was taken.

=== Later proposals ===
The Central London Rail Study of 1989 proposed tunnels linking the existing rail network as the &quot;East–West Crossrail&quot;, &quot;City Crossrail&quot;, and &quot;North–South Crossrail&quot; schemes. The east–west scheme was for a line from Liverpool Street to Paddington/Marylebone with two connections at its western end linking the tunnel to the Great Western Main Line and the Metropolitan line on the Underground. The City route was shown as a new connection across the City of London linking the Great Northern Route with London Bridge.

The north–south line proposed routing West Coast Main Line, Thameslink, and Great Northern trains through Euston and King&#x27;s Cross/, then under the West End via , and Victoria towards and . The report also recommended a number of other schemes including a &quot;Thameslink Metro&quot; route enhancement, and the Chelsea–Hackney line. The cost of the east–west scheme including rolling stock was estimated at £885million.

In 1991, a private bill was submitted to Parliament for a scheme including a new underground line from Paddington to Liverpool Street. The bill was promoted by London Underground and British Rail, and supported by the government; it was rejected by the Private Bill Committee in 1994 on the grounds that a case had not been made, though the government issued &quot;Safeguarding Directions&quot;, protecting the route from any development that would jeopardise future schemes.

In 2001, Cross London Rail Links (CLRL), a joint-venture between TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT), was formed to develop and promote the Crossrail scheme, and also a Wimbledon–Hackney scheme.

While CLRL was promoting the Crossrail project, alternative schemes were being proposed. In 2002, GB Railways put forward a scheme called SuperCrossRail which would link regional stations such as , , , , and via a west–east rail tunnel through central London. The tunnel would follow an alignment along the River Thames, with stations at , and . In 2004 another proposal named Superlink was promoted by a group of senior railway managers. Like SuperCrossRail, Superlink envisaged linking a number of regional stations via a tunnel through London, but advocated the route already safeguarded for Crossrail. CLRL evaluated both proposals and rejected them due to concerns about network capacity and cost issues.

=== Approval ===
The Crossrail Act 2008 was given royal assent in July 2008, giving CLRL the powers necessary to build the line. In September 2009, TfL was loaned £1billion towards the project by the European Investment Bank. Both Conservatives and Labour made commitments in their 2010 election manifestos to deliver Crossrail, and the coalition government following the election was committed to the project.

== Construction ==

=== Chronology ===

In April 2009, Crossrail announced that 17 firms had secured &#x27;Enabling Works Framework Agreements&#x27; and would now be able to compete for packages of works. At the peak of construction up to 14,000 people were expected to be needed in the project&#x27;s supply chain.

Work began on 15 May 2009 when piling works started at the future Canary Wharf station.

The threat of diseases being released by work on the project was raised by Lord James of Blackheath at the passing of the Crossrail Bill. He told the House of Lords select committee that 682 victims of anthrax had been brought into Smithfield in Farringdon with some contaminated meat in 1520 and then buried in the area. On 24 June 2009 it was reported that no traces of anthrax or bubonic plague had been found on human bone fragments discovered during tunnelling.

Invitations to tender for the two principal tunnelling contracts were published in the Official Journal of the European Union in August 2009. &#x27;Tunnels West&#x27; (C300) was for twin tunnels from Royal Oak through to the new Crossrail Farringdon Station, with a portal west of Paddington. The &#x27;Tunnels East&#x27; (C305) request was for three tunnel sections and &#x27;launch chambers&#x27; in east London. Contracts were awarded in late 2010: the &#x27;Tunnels West&#x27; contract was awarded to BAM Nuttall, Ferrovial Agroman and Kier Construction (BFK); the &#x27;Tunnels East&#x27; contract was awarded to Dragados and John Sisk &amp; Son. The remaining tunnelling contract (C310, Plumstead to North Woolwich), which included a tunnel under the Thames, was awarded to Hochtief and J. Murphy &amp; Sons in 2011.

By September 2009, preparatory work for the £1billion developments at station had begun, with buildings (including the Astoria Theatre) being compulsorily purchased and demolished.
In March 2010, contracts were awarded to civil engineering companies for the second round of &#x27;enabling work&#x27; including &#x27;Royal Oak Portal Taxi Facility Demolition&#x27;, &#x27;Demolition works for Crossrail Bond Street Station&#x27;, &#x27;Demolition works for Crossrail Tottenham Court Road Station&#x27; and &#x27;Pudding Mill Lane Portal&#x27;. In December 2010, contracts were awarded for most of the tunnelling work. To assist with the skills required for the Crossrail project, Crossrail opened in 2011 the Tunnelling and Underground Construction Academy in Ilford. The academy was handed over to TfL in 2017, who have sub-contracted its management to PROCAT.

In February 2010, Crossrail was accused of bullying residents whose property lay on the route into selling for less than the market value. A subsequent London Assembly report was highly critical of the insensitive way in which Crossrail had dealt with compulsory purchases and the lack of assistance given to the people and businesses affected. There were also complaints from music fans, as the London Astoria was forced to close.

In December 2011, a contract to ship the excavated material from the tunnel to Wallasea Island was awarded to a joint venture comprising BAM Nuttall Limited and Van Oord UK Limited. Between 4.5 and 5million tonnes of soil would be used to construct a new wetland nature reserve (Wallasea Wetlands). The project eventually moved seven million tons of earth.

Restoration of Connaught Tunnel by filling with concrete foam and reboring, as originally intended, was deemed too great a risk to the structural integrity of the tunnel, and so the docks above were drained to give access to the tunnel roof in order to enlarge its profile. This work took place during 2013.

Boring of the railway tunnels was officially completed at Farringdon on 4 June 2015 in the presence of the Prime Minister and the Mayor of London.

Installation of the track was completed in September 2017. The ETCS signalling was scheduled to be tested in the Heathrow tunnels over the winter of 2017–2018. The south east section of the infrastructure was energised in February 2018, with the first test train run between Plumstead and Abbey Wood that month. In May 2018 the overhead lines were powered up between Westbourne Park and Stepney, the installation of platform doors was completed, and video was released of the first trains travelling through the tunnels.

TfL Rail took over Heathrow Connect services from Paddington to Heathrow in May 2018.

At the end of August 2018, four months before the scheduled opening of the core section of the line, it was announced that completion was delayed and that the line would not open before autumn 2019.

In April 2019, it was announced that Crossrail would be completed between October 2020 and March 2021, two years behind schedule, and that it would not include the opening of the Bond Street station, one of ten new stations on the line. The London Assembly&#x27;s transport committee concluded that TfL played down the prospect of delays to the project in updates to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, and called for TfL commissioner Mike Brown to consider his position. Crossrail said major challenges before completion included writing and testing the software that would integrate the train with three different track signalling systems, and installing equipment inside the tunnels.

In July 2019, it was announced that the line would not open in 2021, with TfL not expecting the full line from Heathrow to Shenfield to open until the early part of the 2023/24 financial year.

In August 2020, Crossrail announced that the central section would be ready to open &quot;in the first half of 2022&quot;.

In May 2021, trial running commenced, with the core section opened by Queen Elizabeth II for passenger service on 24 May 2022.

=== Tunnel boring machines ===

The project used eight diameter tunnel-boring machines (TBM) from Herrenknecht AG (Germany). Two types are used; &#x27;slurry&#x27; type for the Thames tunnel, which involves tunnelling through chalk; and &#x27;Earth Pressure Balance Machines&#x27; (EPBM) for tunnelling through clay, sand and gravel (at lower levels through Lambeth Group and Thanet Sands ground formation). The TBMs weigh nearly 1,000tonnes and are over long. The main tunnelling contracts were valued at around £1.5billion.

Crossrail ran a competition in January 2012 to name the TBMs, in which over 2,500 entries were received and 10 pairs of names short-listed. After a public vote in February 2012, the first three pairs of names were announced on 13 March and the last pair on 16 August 2013:
* &quot;Ada&quot; and &quot;Phyllis&quot;, Royal Oak to Farringdon section, named after Ada Lovelace and Phyllis Pearsall
* &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, Limmo Peninsula to Farringdon section, named after Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II
* &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Sophia&quot;, Plumstead to North Woolwich section, named after Mary and Sophia, the wives respectively of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his father Marc Isambard Brunel, builders of the first tunnel under the Thames
* &quot;Jessica&quot; and &quot;Ellie&quot;, Pudding Mill Lane to Stepney Green and Limmo Peninsula to Victoria Dock sections, named after Jessica Ennis and Ellie Simmonds

=== Health, safety, and industrial relations ===

In September 2012, a gantry supporting a spoil hopper, used to load rail wagons with excavated waste at a construction site near Westbourne Park Underground station, collapsed. It tipped sideways, causing the adjacent Network Rail line to be closed.

On 7 March 2014, Rene Tkacik, a Slovakian construction worker, was killed by a piece of falling concrete while working in a tunnel. In April 2014, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported details of a leaked internal report, compiled for the Crossrail contractors by an independent safety consultancy. The report was alleged to have pointed to poor industrial relations arising from safety concerns, and that workers were &quot;too scared to report injuries for fear of being sacked&quot;.

Three construction workers died from suspected heart attacks over six months in 2019, but Crossrail announced that, following extensive testing, the air quality at Bond Street station was within acceptable limits.

====Blacklisting====

In 2012, Crossrail faced accusations of blacklisting. It was revealed that an industrial relations manager, Ron Barron, employed by Bechtel, had routinely cross-checked job applicants against the Consulting Association database. An employment tribunal in 2010 heard that Barron introduced the use of the blacklist at his former employer, the construction firm Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company (CB&amp;I), and referred to it more than 900 times in 2007 alone. He was found to have unlawfully refused employment to a Philip Willis. Aggravated damages were awarded because Barron had added information about Willis to the blacklist.

In May 2012, a BFK manager challenged their subcontractor, Electrical Installations Services Ltd. (EIS), saying that one of their electricians was a trade union activist. Some days later, Pat Swift, the HR manager for BFK and a regular user of the Consulting Association, again challenged EIS. EIS refused to dismiss their worker and lost the contract. Flash pickets were held at the Crossrail site and also at the sites of the BFK partners. The Scottish Affairs Select Committee called on the UK Business Secretary, Vince Cable, to set up a government investigation into blacklisting at Crossrail.

Further allegations of blacklisting against Crossrail were made in Parliament in September 2017. In March 2023, a former Crossrail worker made a High Court statement regarding a damages claim against Crossrail, Skanska, Costain, T Clarke and NG Bailey for blacklisting. The case had been settled out of court in December 2021. Electrician Daniel Collins had raised health and safety concerns at the Bond Street station site in February 2015, was fired three days later, and faced repeated difficulties in gaining new employment on the project. He alleged there was a &quot;secretive system of misuse of private information&quot; about union activists. Crossrail and the contractors denied all Collins&#x27; allegations, saying they settled the court case &quot;for purely commercial reasons&quot; and &quot;without admission of liability or wrongdoing&quot;. Collins received an undisclosed sum for damages and to cover court costs.

=== Archaeology ===
Much like the Thames Tideway Scheme and the High Speed 2 projects, which were under development in London at the same time as Crossrail, the excavation works that took place during the project gave archaeologists a valuable opportunity to explore the earth underneath London&#x27;s streets that was previously seen as inaccessible. Crossrail undertook what was described as one of the most extensive archaeological programmes ever seen in the UK. Over 100 archaeologists have found tens of thousands of items from 40 sites, spanning 55million years of London&#x27;s history and prehistory. Many of the items were placed on show at the Museum of London Docklands from February to September 2017.
Some of the most notable finds include:
* Victims of the Great Plague, a mass grave of 42 skeletons found at Liverpool Street station
* Thirteen skeletons, thought to be of victims of the Black Death in the 14th century, uncovered under the road that surrounds the gardens in Charterhouse Square, Farringdon in March 2013
* Prehistoric knapped flints discovered in North Woolwich
* A Tudor period bowling ball found in Stepney Green
* Medieval ice skates found near Liverpool Street station
* Bison and reindeer bones
* Leather shoes dating from the Tudor period
* Roman coins and a Roman medallion found at Liverpool Street which was issued to mark the New Year celebrations in AD 245. This medallion was only the second ever of its kind to be found in Europe.
* Two parts of a woolly mammoth jawbone
* The largest piece of amber ever found in the UK, discovered at Canary Wharf
* A Victorian chamber pot found near Stepney Green
* 13,000 Crosse &amp; Blackwell jars found near Tottenham Court Road from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
* Part of a small barge or fishing vessel from 1223 to 1290 found at Canning Town

=== Operational testing ===
In the first half of 2021, Crossrail entered trial running stage of construction. Crossrail, in partnership with TfL, ran trains to a timetable through the core section, to check the reliability of the railway. In November 2021, Crossrail entered trial operation which is the final stage before opening.

=== Expected completion ===
With an initial budget of £14.8billion, the total cost rose to £18.25billion by November 2019, and increased further to £18.8billion by December 2020.
Delays to the project of several months were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in England, and in late 2020 this reduced the number of workers that could be safely on-site.

By August 2021, seven of the nine new stations had been handed over to TfL.

The Abbey Wood to Paddington section opened to passengers on 24 May 2022, although initially trains did not run on Sundays to allow for further testing, nor did they call at Bond Street, which opened on 24 October 2022. From Sunday 6 November trains began running directly from Reading and Heathrow in the west to Abbey Wood, and from Shenfield in the east through to Paddington as the surface railways connect with the central tunnels. TfL expects that the full line, with final timetable, will be operational by May 2023.

== Route ==
In the west, the new tunnel connects with the Great Western Main Line at Royal Oak, west of . East of the line splits at an underground junction. The north-eastern branch emerges to join the existing Great Eastern Main Line at . The south-eastern branch runs underground to Abbey Wood via Canary Wharf, Custom House and Woolwich. This branch takes over a stretch of the former North London line built by the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, and connects it with the North Kent Line via a tunnel under the Thames at North Woolwich.

The tunnelled sections are altogether approximately in length.

There are new stations at Paddington, , , , and Whitechapel, with interchanges with London Underground and National Rail services. Due to the length and positioning of the new platforms, Farringdon station is also connected to station, and Liverpool Street to station.

=== Western end ===

From the western end of the tunnel Elizabeth line services continue to where they either remain on the Great Western Main Line and run to or via or split off to the Heathrow branch terminating at Heathrow Terminals 4 or 5. Existing stations were refurbished and upgraded, including the provision of step-free access at all stations, and platform lengthening at most to accommodate the new trains.

Earlier plans suggested terminating at Maidenhead, with an extension to Reading safeguarded. Various commentators advocated an extension further west as far as Reading because it was seen as complementary to the Great Western Electrification project which was announced in July 2009. A Reading terminus was also recommended by Network Rail&#x27;s 2011 Route Utilisation Strategy. On 27 March 2014 it was announced that the line would indeed extend to Reading.

A flyover at Airport Junction near Hayes &amp; Harlington station allows Heathrow Express trains to pass over the track used by Crossrail, avoiding delays caused by crossings. The line between the junction and Heathrow Central (mostly in a tunnel) is not owned by Network Rail but by Heathrow Airport Holdings.

A &quot;dive-under&quot; was constructed at Acton to allow passenger trains to pass slower freight trains leaving and entering a goods yard. It was completed in July 2016 and was brought into use in 2017.


=== Eastern end ===
The north-eastern Crossrail tunnel connects with the Great Eastern Main Line at . The Elizabeth line runs to via , and .

== Design and infrastructure ==

=== Name and identity ===

&quot;Crossrail&quot; is the name of the construction project and of the limited company, wholly owned by TfL, that was formed to carry out construction works. The &quot;Elizabeth line&quot; is the name of the new service that will be seen on signage throughout the stations. It is named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II. The Elizabeth line logo features a Transport for London roundel with a purple ring and TfL-blue bar with white text. &quot;TfL Rail&quot; was an intermediate brand name which was introduced in May 2015 and discontinued in May 2022. It was used by TfL on services between Paddington and Heathrow Terminal 5 and Reading, as well as trains between Liverpool Street and Shenfield.

=== Tunnels ===
 of twin-bore tunnels were constructed by tunnel boring machines (TBM), each with an internal diameter of (compared with for the deep-level Victoria line). The wide-diameter tunnels allow for new rolling stock, which is larger than the traditional deep-level tube trains. The tunnels allow for the emergency evacuation of passengers through the side doors rather than along the length of the train.

The tunnels are made up of three main sections: a tunnel from Royal Oak portal near Royal Oak station to Victoria Dock portal near Custom House station, a tunnel from portal connecting to the longer tunnel at an underground junction at Stepney Green cavern, and a separate tunnel from Plumstead to North Woolwich underneath the Thames. The Custom House to North Woolwich section, included a £50million investment to renovate and reuse the Connaught tunnel.

Crossrail has often been compared to Paris&#x27;s RER system due to the length of the central tunnel.

=== Stations ===
 The majority of stations in the central section all have distinctive architecture at street level; whereas stations at platform level have identical &quot;kit-of-parts&quot; architecture, including full height platform screen doors with integrated passenger information displays. This is a different approach from the Jubilee Line Extension in the 1990s, where each station was designed by a different architect. Artwork was also installed at seven of the stations in the central section.

A mock-up of the new stations was built in Bedfordshire in 2011 to ensure that their architectural integrity would last for a century. It was planned to bring at least one mock-up to London for the public to view the design and give feedback before final construction commenced.

81 escalators were installed at the nine new stations. At in length, the escalators at Bond Street are just one metre shorter than the escalators at Angel, the longest escalator on the Underground. All stations in the central section were built to be step free from street to train, with 54 lifts installed in the nine new stations.

Existing stations on the Great Western Main Line and Great Eastern Main Line were upgraded and refurbished, with some stations receiving new entrance buildings. All surface level stations have lifts, allowing step free access from street to platform. 

=== Electrification and signalling ===
Crossrail uses 25kV, 50Hz AC overhead lines, which are also used on the Great Eastern and Great Western Main Lines.

The Heathrow branch started using the European Train Control System (ETCS) in 2020. The Automatic Warning (AWS) and Train Protection &amp; Warning (TPWS) systems are used on the Great Western and Great Eastern Main Lines, with possible later upgrades to ETCS. Communications-based train control (CBTC) is installed in the central section and the Abbey Wood branch.

=== Depots ===
Crossrail will have depots in west London at Old Oak Common TMD, in south-east London at Plumstead Depot, and in east London at Ilford EMU Depot and at a new signalling centre at in Havering, East London.

==Further proposals==
=== Additional stations ===
==== Silvertown (London City Airport) ====
Although the Crossrail route passes very close to London City Airport, there is no station serving the airport directly. London City Airport had proposed the re-opening of Silvertown railway station, in order to create an interchange between the rail line and the airport. The self-funded £50million station plan was supported &#x27;in principle&#x27; by the London Borough of Newham. Provisions for re-opening of the station were made in 2012 by Crossrail. However, it was alleged by the airport that TfL was hostile to the idea of a station on the site, a claim disputed by TfL.

In 2018, the airport&#x27;s chief development officer described the lack of a Crossrail station as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot;, but did not rule out a future station for the airport. The CEO stated in an interview that a station is not essential to the airport&#x27;s success. In May 2019, the chief development officer confirmed discussions are ongoing about a station for the airport as part of the proposed extension to Ebbsfleet.

==== Old Oak Common ====

As part of the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail link from London to Birmingham, a new station is being built at between Paddington and Acton Main Line station. The new station will connect HS2 services with Crossrail and National Rail services on the Great Western Main Line, as well as London Overground services running through the area. The original plan was that the station would open with High Speed 2 in 2026, with preliminary construction beginning in 2019.
Go-ahead for construction was given in June 2021.

=== Extensions ===
==== To Ebbsfleet and Gravesend ====
In the 2003 and 2004 consultations into Crossrail, the South East branch was proposed to go beyond Abbey Wood, running along the North Kent Line to Ebbsfleet, linking up with the (then under construction) Channel Tunnel Rail Link. However, prior to the submission of the Crossrail Hybrid Bill to Parliament in 2005, the branch was truncated at Abbey Wood to cut overall project costs. Although dropped from the main scheme, the route was safeguarded by the DfT as far as Gravesend and Hoo Junction, protecting the route from development.

With the Crossrail project nearing completion in 2018, local MPs, council leaders and local businesses began lobbying the government to fund the development of a business case for the extension to Ebbsfleet, with the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan including the project in his Mayor&#x27;s Transport Strategy. The Mayor&#x27;s Transport Strategy estimated that an extension could assist in delivering 55,000 new homes and 50,000 new jobs planned along the route in Bexley and north Kent. In March 2019, the Government committed £4.8million on exploratory work into the extension as part of the Thames Estuary 2050 Growth Commission.

The following stations are on the protected route extension to Gravesend: , , , , , for Bluewater, , Ebbsfleet, , and .

==== To the West Coast Main Line ====
Network Rail&#x27;s July 2011 London &amp; South East Route Utilisation Strategy (RUS) recommended that a short railway line could be built to connect the West Coast Main Line (WCML) with the Crossrail route. This would enable train services that currently run between and London Euston to be re-routed via Old Oak Common to serve central London, and . The report argued that this would free up capacity at Euston for the planned High Speed 2, reduce London Underground congestion at Euston, make better use of Crossrail&#x27;s capacity west of Paddington, and improve access to Heathrow Airport from the north. Under this scheme, all Crossrail trains would continue west of Paddington, instead of some of them terminating there. They would serve Heathrow Airport (10 tph), stations to Maidenhead and Reading (6 tph), and stations to Milton Keynes Central (8 tph).

In August 2014, a statement by transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated that the government was actively evaluating the extension of Crossrail as far as and , with potential Crossrail stops at , , , , , , , , , , and . The extension would relieve some pressure from London Underground and London Euston station while also increasing connectivity. Conditions to the extension were that any extra services should not affect the planned service pattern for confirmed routes, as well as affordability. This proposal was shelved in August 2016 due to &quot;poor overall value for money to the taxpayer&quot;.

====To Staines====
As part of the Heathrow Southern Railway scheme proposed in 2017, the western extent of the Crossrail route could be extended beyond Heathrow Airport to terminate at . This extension would form part of a wider scheme to create new rail links in west London and Surrey serving Heathrow, and would require the construction of an extra platform at Staines station. This proposal has not been approved or funded.

====To Southend Airport====
Stobart Aviation, the company that previously operated Southend Airport in Essex, proposed that Crossrail should be extended beyond Shenfield along the Shenfield–Southend line to serve Southend Airport and . The company has suggested that a direct Heathrow-Southend link could alleviate capacity problems at Heathrow. The extension proposal has been supported by Southend-on-Sea City Council.

== Management and franchise ==
Funding for the project came from:
* TfL
* Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (a local tax charged on property developments across Greater London, with different charging rates for each London borough)
* Crossrail Business Rate Supplement (additional business rates)
* Section 106 Agreement payments
* Over-site development opportunities
* UK Government
* City of London Corporation
* Major landowners: Canary Wharf Group, Heathrow Airport Holdings, and Berkeley Homes.

Crossrail was built by Crossrail Ltd, jointly owned by TfL and the DfT until December 2008, when full ownership was transferred to TfL. In 2007, Crossrail had a £15.9billion funding package in place for the construction of the line. Although the branch lines to the west and to Shenfield will still be owned by Network Rail, the tunnel will be owned and operated by TfL.

On 18 July 2014, TfL London Rail said that MTR Corp had won the concession to operate the services for eight years, with an option for two more years. The concession will be similar to London Overground. It is planned for the franchise to run for eight years from May 2015, taking over control of Shenfield metro services from Abellio Greater Anglia in May 2015, and Reading / Heathrow services from Great Western Railway in 2018.

In anticipation of a May 2015 transfer of Shenfield to Liverpool Street services from the East Anglia franchise to Crossrail, the invitation to tender for the 2012–2013 franchise required the new rail operator to set up a separate &quot;Crossrail business unit&quot; for those services before the end of 2012, to allow transfer of services to the new Crossrail Train Operating Concession (CTOC) operator during the next franchise.

The infrastructure of the core section is managed by Rail for London Infrastructure (RfLI), a subsidiary of TfL. Signalling is controlled by Network Rail&#x27;s Romford Rail Operating Centre.

<doc id="241694" wikidata="Q8034614" url="?curid=241694" title="Work design">
<text>Work design (also referred to as job design or task design) is an area of research and practice within industrial and organizational psychology, and is concerned with the &quot;content and organization of one&#x27;s work tasks, activities, relationships, and responsibilities&quot; (p. 662). Research has demonstrated that work design has important implications for individual employees (e.g., employee engagement, job strain, risk of occupational injury), teams (e.g., how effectively groups co-ordinate their activities), organisations (e.g., productivity, occupational safety and health targets), and society (e.g., utilizing the skills of a population or promoting effective aging).

The terms &quot;job design&quot; and &quot;work design&quot; are often used interchangeably in psychology and human resource management literature, and the distinction is not always well-defined. A job is typically defined as an aggregation of tasks assigned to individual. However, in addition to executing assigned technical tasks, people at work often engage in a variety of emergent, social, and self-initiated activities. Some researchers have argued that the term &quot;job design&quot; therefore excludes processes that are initiated by incumbents (e.g., proactivity, job crafting) as well as those that occur at the level of teams (e.g., autonomous work groups). The term &quot;work design&quot; has been increasingly used to capture this broader perspective. Additionally, deliberate interventions aimed at altering work design are sometimes referred to as &quot;work redesign.&quot; Such interventions can be initiated by the management of an organization (e.g., job rotation, job enlargement, job enrichment) or by individual workers (e.g., job crafting, role innovation, idiosyncratic deals).

== History ==

Interest in the question of what makes good work was largely initiated during the industrial revolution, when machine-operated work in large factories replaced smaller, craft-based industries. In 1776, Adam Smith popularized the concept of division of labor in his book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, which states that dividing production processes into different stages would enable workers to focus on specific tasks, increasing overall productivity. This idea was further developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century with his highly influential theory of scientific management (sometimes referred to as Taylorism). Taylor argued that jobs should be broken down into the smallest possible parts and managers should specify the one best way that these tasks should be carried out. Additionally, Taylor believed that maximum efficiency could only be achieved when managers were responsible for planning work while workers were responsible for performing tasks.

Scientific management became highly influential during the early 20th century, as the narrow tasks reduced training times and allowed less skilled and therefore cheaper labor to be employed. In 1910, Henry Ford took the ideas of scientific management further, introducing the idea of the automotive assembly line. In Ford&#x27;s assembly lines, each worker was assigned a specific set of tasks, standing stationary while a mechanical conveyor belt brought the assemblies to the worker. While the assembly line made it possible to manufacture complex products at a fast rate, the jobs were extremely repetitive and workers were almost tied to the line.

Researchers began to observe that simplified jobs were negatively affecting employees&#x27; mental and physical health, while other negative consequences for organizations such as turnover, strikes, and absenteeism began to be documented. Over time, a field of research within industrial and organizational psychology known as job design, and more recently work design, emerged. Empirical work in the field flourished from the 1960s, and has become ever more relevant with modern technological developments that have changed the fundamental nature of work, such as automation, artificial intelligence, and remote work.

== Theoretical perspectives ==

===Job characteristics model===
Hackman &amp; Oldham&#x27;s (1976) &quot;job characteristics model&quot; is generally considered to be the dominant motivational theory of work design. The model identifies five core job characteristics that affect five work-related outcomes (i.e. motivation, satisfaction, performance, and absenteeism and turnover) through three psychological states (i.e. experienced meaningfulness, experienced responsibility, and knowledge of results):

# Skill variety – The degree to which a job involves a variety of activities, requiring the worker to develop a variety of skills and talents. Workers are more likely to have a more positive experience in jobs that require several different skills and abilities than when the jobs are elementary and routine.
# Task identity – The degree to which the job requires completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work with a clear outcome. Workers are more likely have a more positive experience in a job when they are involved in the entire process rather than just being responsible for a part of the work.
# Task significance – The degree to which a job has a substantial impact on the lives or work of others. Workers are more likely have a more positive experience in a job that substantially improves either psychological or physical well-being of others than a job that has limited effect on anyone else.
# Autonomy – The degree to which the job provides the employee with significant freedom, independence, and discretion to plan out the work and determine the procedures in the job. For jobs with a high level of autonomy, the outcomes of the work depend on the workers&#x27; own efforts, initiatives, and decisions; rather than on the instructions from a manager or a manual of job procedures. In such cases, the jobholders experience greater personal responsibility for their own successes and failures at work.
# Feedback – The degree to which a job incumbent has knowledge of results. When workers receive clear, actionable information about their work performance, they have better overall knowledge of the effect of their work activities, and what specific actions they need to take (if any) to improve their productivity.
The central proposition of job characteristics theory - that is, that work characteristics affect attitudinal outcomes - is well established by meta analysis. However, some have criticized the use of job incumbents&#x27; perceptions to assess job characteristics, arguing that individuals&#x27; perceptions are constructions arising from social influences, such as the attitudes of their peers.

Job characteristics theory has been described as the logical conclusion of efforts to understand how work can satisfy basic human needs. The development of the job characteristics model was largely stimulated by Frederick Herzberg&#x27;s two factor theory (also known as &quot;motivator-hygiene theory&quot;). Although Herzberg&#x27;s theory was largely discredited, the idea that intrinsic job factors impact motivation sparked an interest in the ways in which jobs could be enriched which culminated in the job characteristics model.

=== Sociotechnical systems ===
&quot;Sociotechnical systems&quot; is an organizational development approach which proposes that the technical and social aspects of work should be jointly optimized when designing work. This contrasts with traditional methods that prioritize the technical component and then &#x27;fit&#x27; people into it, often resulting in mediocre performance at a high social cost. Application of sociotechnical theory has typically focused on group rather than individual work design, and is responsible for the rise of autonomous work groups, which are still popular today.

One of the key principles of sociotechnical system design is that overall productivity is directly related to the system&#x27;s accurate analysis of the social and technical needs. Accurate analysis of these needs typically results in the following work characteristics:

* Minimal critical specification of rules – Work design should be precise about what has to be done, but not how to do it. The use of rules, policies and procedures should be kept to a minimum.
* Variance control – Deviations from the ideal process should be controlled at the point where they originate.
* Multiskills – A work system will be more flexible and adaptive if each member of the system is skilled in more than one function.
* Boundary location – Interdependent roles should fall within the same departmental boundaries, usually drawn on the basis of technology, territory, and/or time.
* Information flow – Information systems should provide information at the point of problem solving rather than being based on hierarchical channels.
* Support congruence – The social system should reinforce behaviours which are intended by the work group structure.
* Design and human values – The design should achieve superior results by providing a high quality of work life for individuals.

=== Job demands-control model ===

Karasek&#x27;s (1979) &quot;job demands-control model&quot; is the earliest and most cited model relating work design to occupational stress. The key assumption of this model is that low levels of work-related decision latitude (i.e. job control) combined with high workloads (i.e. job demands) can lead to poorer physical and mental health. For example, high pressure and demands at work may lead to a range of negative outcomes such as psychological stress, burnout, and compromised physical health. Additionally, the model suggests that high levels of job control can buffer or reduce the adverse health effects of high job demands. Instead, this high decision latitude can lead to feelings of mastery and confidence, which in turn aid the individual in coping with further job demands.

The job demands-control model is widely regarded as a classic work design theory, spurring large amounts of research. However, the model has been criticized for its focus on a narrow set of work characteristics. Additionally, while strong support has been found for the negative effects of high job demands, some researchers have argued that the buffering effect of high job control on the negative effects of demand is less convincing.

==== Job demands-resources model ====

The &quot;job demands-resources model&quot; was introduced as a theoretical extension to the job demands-control model, and recognizes that other features of work in addition to control and support might serve as resources to counter job demands. The authors of the job demands-resources model argued that previous models of employee well-being &quot;have been restricted to a given and limited set of predictor variables that may not be relevant for all job positions&quot; (p. 309). Examples of the resources identified in this model include career opportunities, participation in decision making, and social support.

=== Relational job design theory ===
&quot;Relational job design theory&quot; is a popular contemporary approach to work design developed by American organizational psychologist Adam Grant, which builds on the foundations laid by Hackman &amp; Oldham&#x27;s (1976) job characteristics model. The core thesis of relational work design is that the work context shapes workers&#x27; motivations to care about making a prosocial difference (i.e. the desire to help or benefit others). Rather than focusing on the characteristics of tasks which make up jobs, relational work design is concerned with the &#x27;relational architecture&#x27; of the workplace that influences workers&#x27; interpersonal relationships and connections with beneficiaries of the work. In this context, beneficiaries refer to the people whom the worker believes are affected by his or her work. An employer can design the relational architecture of the workplace as a means of motivating workers to care about making a prosocial difference.

Grant&#x27;s theory makes a distinction between two key components of relational architecture:

* Impact on beneficiaries – This refers to the perception that one&#x27;s work has a positive impact on the lives and well-being of others. A visible, positive impact of the job provides employees with a feeling that their tasks matter, which in turn results in higher prosocial motivation.
* Contact with beneficiaries – This refers to opportunities for employees to communicate and interact with the people who benefit from their work. Increased interaction with clients will result in employees will become more emotionally engaged &quot;as a result of first-hand exposure to their actions affecting a living, breathing human being&quot; (p. 307). Thus, increasing job contact results in higher prosocial motivation.

=== Learning and development approach ===
The &quot;learning and development approach&quot; to work design, advanced by Australian organizational behavior Professor Sharon K. Parker, draws on the findings of a diverse body of research which shows that certain job characteristics (e.g. high demands and control, autonomy, complex work with low supervision) can promote learning and development in workers. Parker argues that work design can not only shape cognitive, identity, and moral processes, but also speed up an individual&#x27;s learning and development.

=== Economic theory ===
In economics, job design has been studied in the field of contract theory. In particular, Holmström and Milgrom (1991) have developed the multi-task moral hazard model. Some of the tasks are easier to measure than other tasks, so one can study which tasks should be bundled together. While the original model was focused on the incentives versus insurance trade-off when agents are risk-averse, subsequent work has also studied the case of risk-neutral agents who are protected by limited liability. In this framework, researchers have studied whether tasks that are in direct conflict with each other (for instance, selling products that are imperfect substitutes) should be delegated to the same agent or to different agents. The optimal task assignment depends on whether the tasks are to be performed simultaneously or sequentially.

== Measurement and diagnostics ==

=== Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS) ===
The &quot;Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS)&quot; was developed by Hackman and Oldham in 1975 to assess perceptions of the core job characteristics outlined in job characteristics theory. The JDS consists of seven scales measuring variety, autonomy, task identity, significance, job feedback, feedback from others, and dealing with others. Prior to the development of viable alternatives, the JDS was the most commonly used job design measure. However, some authors have criticised its focus on a narrow set of motivational characteristics and neglect of other important work characteristics. Additionally, the psychometric properties of the JDS have been brought into question, including a low internal consistency and problems with the factor structure.

=== Multimethod Job Design Questionnaire (MJDQ) ===
The &quot;Multimethod Job Design Questionnaire (MJDQ)&quot; was developed by Michael Campion in 1988 to assess what were, at the time, the main interdisciplinary approaches to work design (i.e. motivational, mechanistic, biological, perceptual motor). Intended to address the weaknesses of the JDS, the MJDQ suffered from both measurement problems and gaps in construct measurement.

=== Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) ===
The &quot;Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ)&quot; was developed by Morgeson and Humphrey in 2006 as a comprehensive and integrative work design measure which addresses the inadequacies of its predecessors. The WDQ focuses not only on the tasks that make up a person&#x27;s job, but also the relations between workers and the broader environment. The WDQ has since been translated into several languages other than English, including German, Italian, and Spanish.

== Antecedents of work design behaviours ==
Decisions about the organization of work are typically made by those in positions of formal authority, such as executives, managers, and team leaders. These decisions, which usually regard the division of labor and the integration of effort, create work designs in which employees have assigned tasks and responsibilities. In addition to work design arising from formal decision-making, work design can also be created through emergent, informal, and social processes (e.g. role expectations from peers). Usually, these types of processes arise from the actions and decisions of employees, meaning employees have a certain degree of agency in shaping their own work designs.

=== Motivation, knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) ===
In accordance with the ability-motivation-opportunity model of behaviour, the work design-related decisions of individuals are shaped by their &quot;motivation&quot; and &quot;knowledge, skills, and abilities&quot;. These proximal processes apply to decision making in both people in formal positions of authority (i.e. managers) as well as individual employees. With respect to motivation, managers&#x27; decisions could be shaped by autonomous motivation (e.g. the desire the retain employees) or controlled motivation (e.g. reducing staffing costs). In terms of KSAs, managers&#x27; knowledge about work design options and their skills to engage employees in the decision making process may shape their decisions. It is believed that these same processes apply to employees&#x27; work design-related actions and decisions.

=== Opportunity ===
&quot;Opportunity&quot;, in this context, refers to the uncontrollable forces surrounding an individual that enable or constrain the individuals task performance. Regardless of an individual&#x27;s motivation or KSAs regarding a particular work design-related decision, that individual can only implement change if they have the opportunity to do so. For example, if a manager lacks the power to mobilise necessary resources, perhaps due to a rigid organizational hierarchy, their work design-related actions would be constrained.

=== Individual influences ===

* Demographics – Characteristics such as age, gender, and ethnicity can shape work design decisions. The more these attributes signal assumptions that the employee is competent and trustworthy, the more managers will be motivated to make role adjustments to improve work design. Additionally, there is evidence that demographic characteristics can affect the work design decision of employees. For example, older workers may be discouraged to renegotiate their work designs due to discriminatory attitudes in the workplace. Gender and ethnicity can make some workers more vulnerable to low-quality work designs, with data showing that female workers have less autonomy, fewer development opportunities, and reduced career possibilities. Evidence also suggests that migrant workers often have less enriched work designs compared to non-migrant workers.
* Competence and learning – Karasek and Theorell propose that enriched work designs create a self-perpetuating spiral by which the promotion of learning builds employees&#x27; mastery and competence, which in turn enables employees to take on more challenging tasks and responsibilities, generating further learning.
* Other individual differences – Personality traits and stable individual differences such as motivation and initiative can affect both managerial and individual work design-related decision making. For example, personality traits may affect who managers select for particular jobs as well as an employee&#x27;s choice of occupation.

=== Contextual influences ===

* International – Organizations operate today under the influence of globalization and market liberalization. While there is little empirical work on the direct effects of these factors, some have argued that globalization has increased the perceived threat of competition and job insecurity, leading to increased expectations about working harder. Additionally, increased access to new suppliers in other countries, especially developing countries, has increased the potential for organizations to influence work design in these countries. Evidence has shown that cost pressures on suppliers are linked to poor work designs, such as high workloads and physical demands.
* National – Organizations are subject to the economic, cultural, and institutional context of the country they operate in. Work designs in economies with a relatively high GDP and low employment typically have lower workloads and higher job resources (e.g. autonomy, skill variety, challenge) due to higher investment in practices aimed at attracting and retaining employees. Additionally, some have argued that national culture shapes individual preferences for particular working conditions. For example, managers and employees from cultures with a preference for structure and formal rules might prefer work designs which are clearly defined. Finally, national institutions such as trade unions, national employment policies, and training systems policies may have direct or indirect effects on work design.
* Occupational – Occupations shape the distribution of tasks as well as the influence of skills used in completing those tasks, both of which are key to work design. Additionally, occupations tend to encourage and reinforce particular values, which may or may not be congruent with the values of individual workers. For example, occupations which value independence (e.g. police detectives) are likely to reward actions which demonstrate initiative and creativity, giving rise to job characteristics such as autonomy and variety.
* Organizational – According to strategic human resource management theory (SHRM), a key task for managers is to adopt HR practices which are internally consistent with the strategic objectives of the organization. For example, if an organization&#x27;s strategy is to gain competitive advantage by minimizing costs, managers may be motivated to adopt work designs based on scientific management (i.e. low training and induction costs to allow low-skill and low-paid workers to be employed). In contrast, managers working for an organization that aims to gain competitive advantage through quality and innovation may be motivated to provide employees with opportunities to use specialist knowledge and skills, resulting in enriched work designs.
* Work groups – Drawing on the sociotechnical theory and team effectiveness literature, some authors argue that key characteristics of work groups (i.e. composition, interdependence, autonomy, and leadership) can influence the work design of individual team members, although it is acknowledged that evidence on this particular topic is limited.

==Strategies for work (re)design==

=== Managerial strategies ===

====Job rotation====

&quot;Job rotation&quot; is a job design process by which employee roles are rotated in order to promote flexibility and tenure in the working environment. Through job rotation, employees laterally mobilize and serve their tasks in different organizational levels; when an individual experiences different posts and responsibilities in an organization, the ability to evaluate his or her capabilities in the organization increases. By design, it is intended to enhance motivation, develop workers&#x27; outlook, increase productivity, improve the organization&#x27;s performance on various levels by its multi-skilled workers, and provides new opportunities to improve the attitude, thought, capabilities and skills of workers.

====Job enlargement====

Hulin and Blood (1968) define &quot;job enlargement&quot; as the process of allowing individual workers to determine their own pace (within limits), to serve as their own inspectors by giving them responsibility for quality control, to repair their own mistakes, to be responsible for their own machine set-up and repair, and to attain choice of method. By working in a larger scope, as Hulin and Blood state, workers are pushed to adapting new tactics, techniques, and methodologies on their own. Frederick Herzberg referred to the addition of interrelated tasks as &#x27;horizontal job loading,&#x27; or, in other words, widening the breadth of an employee&#x27;s responsibilities.

====Job enrichment====

&quot;Job enrichment&quot; increases the employees&#x27; autonomy over the planning and execution of their own work, leading to self-assigned responsibility. Because of this, job enrichment has the same motivational advantages of job enlargement, however it has the added benefit of granting workers autonomy. Frederick Herzberg viewed job enrichment as &#x27;vertical job loading&#x27; because it also includes tasks formerly performed by someone at a higher level where planning and control are involved.

=== Individual strategies ===

==== Job crafting ====

&quot;Job crafting&quot; can be defined as the proactive changing the boundaries and conditions of the tasks, relationships, and meaning of a job. These changes are not negotiated with the employer and may not even be noticed by the manager. Job crafting behaviours have been found to lead to a variety of positive work outcomes, including work engagement, job satisfaction, resilience, and thriving.

==== Role innovation ====
&quot;Role innovation&quot; occurs when an employee proactively redefines a work role by changing the mission or practice of the role. When work roles are defined by organizations they do not always adequately address the problems faced by the profession. When employees notice this, they can attempt to redefine the role through innovation, improving the resilience of the profession in handling future situations.

==== Task revision ====
&quot;Task revision&quot; is seen as a form of counter-role behavior in that it is about resistance to defective work procedures, such as inaccurate job descriptions and dysfunctional expectations. This may involves acting against the norms of the organization with the end goal of making corrections to procedures. It has been noted that task revision rarely occurs in work settings as this type of resistance is often seen as inappropriate by managers and employees alike. However, a work environment which is supportive of deviation from social norms could facilitate task revision.

==== Voice ====
In the context of job redesign, &quot;voice&quot; refers to behaviours which emphasize challenging the status quo with the intention of improving the situation rather than merely criticizing. This can be as simple as suggesting more effective ways of doing things within the organization. When individuals stand up and express innovating ideas, the organization may benefit from these fresh perspectives. Voice may be particularly important in organizations where change and innovation is necessary for survival. While the individual employee does not immediately benefit from this expression, successful innovations may lead to improved performance appraisals.

==== Idiosyncratic deals ====
&quot;Idiosyncratic deals&quot;, also known as &quot;i-deals&quot;, is a concept developed by American organizational psychologist Denise Rousseau which refers to individualized work arrangements negotiated proactively by an employee with their employer. The most common forms of i-deals are flexible working hours and opportunities for personal development. However, also other forms of Idiosyncratic deals are known from previous research, such as task and work responsibilities, workload reduction, location flexibility, and financial Incentives These arrangements may be put in place because an employer values the negotiating employee, and by granting the i-deal the likelihood of retaining the employee is increased. This can be seen as a win-win scenario for both parties.

==== Personal initiative ====

&quot;Personal initiative&quot; refers to self-starting behaviours by an employee that are consistent with the mission of the organization, has a long term focus, are goal directed and action oriented, and are persistent in the face of difficulty. Additionally, these behaviours typically go beyond what is required of the employee in their work role.

<text>Read is a village in Lancashire 5 miles west northwest of Burnley and 2 miles east of Whalley. It is on the A671 which is the main road between Burnley and Clitheroe. The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 census was 1,419.

==History==
The name &quot;Read&quot; is a contraction of Old English words meaning female roe deer and ridge or headland.

The old village developed in the 16th century along the main mediaeval road between Whalley and Padiham.

The Battle of Read Old Bridge was fought in 1643 between the Royalist and Parliamentarian forces. The Royalist force of about 4,000 men, commanded by the Earl of Derby, had taken the village of Whalley. The Parliamentary force, numbering only about 400 men, were positioned near Read Old Bridge. As the Royalist forces approached the bridge they faced withering musket fire causing them to retreat in confusion. The Royalists gave up Whalley; about 400 largely untrained soldiers had beaten 4,000, winning Lancashire for Parliament.

==Governance==
Read was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley, with the River Calder forming the boundary with Altham and Sabden Brook with Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Burnley Rural District from 1894 to 1974. Parts of the parish transferred to Sabden on its creation in 1904. It has since become part of the borough of Ribble Valley.

Together with Simonstone, the parish forms the Read and Simonstone ward of Ribble Valley Borough Council. The ward had a population of 2,535 in 2001, rising to 2,573 in 2011. The ward elects two councillors, who currently are Richard Bennett and Lesley Graves, both of the Conservative Party.

==Landmarks==
Read Hall and Park was the seat of the Nowell family from the 14th century and Roger Nowell was a magistrate at the time of the Lancashire Witches in 1612 sending them to Lancaster for trial and eventual execution.

In the 1870s Victoria Mill, together with a few houses for employees, was built alongside the turnpike road by the Kemp family and this area of Read became known as Newtown. More houses and shops were built using stone quarried in the village and Read now has a variety of small businesses catering for many needs.

The parish church is dedicated to St John the Evangelist by Henry Ross of Accrington, 1884, with the west steeple dating from 1911.

The nearby Martholme Viaduct, about south-west carried the defunct Great Harwood loop line of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway over the River Calder between Simonstone and Great Harwood and was built by Sturges Meek, 1870–77, and consists of ten 65 ft high arches on a gentle curve.

<doc id="241697" wikidata="Q3216841" url="?curid=241697" title="California kingsnake">
<text>The California kingsnake (Lampropeltis californiae) is a nonvenomous colubrid snake endemic to the western United States and northern Mexico, and is found in a variety of habitats. Due to ease of care and a wide range of color variations, the California kingsnake is one of the most popular snakes in captivity.

== Description ==

Wild California kingsnakes are typically encountered at a length of 2.5-3.5 feet (76 – 107 cm), though they can grow larger; California kingsnakes on Isla Ángel de la Guarda, Baja California, Mexico, have been documented growing to 78 inches (2 m). A wide range of color morphs exist in the wild; they are usually found with alternating dark and light bands ranging in color from black and white to brown and cream. Some populations may have longitudinal stripes instead of bands. Most California kingsnakes live to be around ten to fifteen years old, even surpassing twenty if well cared for in captivity.

California kingsnakes stripes and bands are essential to their survival as the patterns camouflage the snakes body to hide from predators. Their predators include hawks, eagles, coyotes, skunks, foxes, bobcats, and other kingsnakes.

== Range and habitat ==
The California kingsnake is widespread along the West Coast of North America to elevations of approximately in the Tehachapi Mountains and to over in the southeastern Sierra Nevada Mountains. This species lives in a wide variety of habitats, including woodland chaparral, grassland, deserts, marshes, and even suburban areas. These snakes live in Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, southwestern Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, and northwestern Mexico. These snakes thrive in the temperatures between 80-84 °F and a humidity around 35-60%. The optimal environment can differ depending on the biological state of the snake. For instance, during reproduction they prefer even warmer temperatures, and in the process of shedding, they prefer higher humidity. In Arizona, they intergrade with the desert kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis splendida&quot;) and the Mexican black kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis getula nigrita&quot;). 

The species has also become invasive on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria. In 2014 the population had reached an estimated 20,000 individuals.

== Behavior ==
The California kingsnake is a cathemeral species of snake; they may be active day or night depending on ambient temperatures. When disturbed, California kingsnakes will often coil their bodies into a ball to hide their heads, hiss, and rattle their tails, which can produce a sound somewhat resembling that of a rattlesnake. When they are nervous they tend to twitch their tails. They are considered harmless to humans, but if handled it is common for this species to bite, as well as excrete musk and fecal contents from their cloaca. It is also common for this musky odor to be excreted when the snake feels threatened. California kingsnakes are considered to be more solitary animals, but when mating season or brumation is in process, they will group together.

California Kingsnakes, along with other reptiles and amphibians in winter months brumate, as a means of conserving energy and to regulate body temperatures during cold temperatures. During brumation, California king snakes neither eat nor excrete feces, but they will occasionally awake to drink water. Also in efforts to regulate body temperatures, California kingsnakes tend to burrow underneath vegetation or other coverings to cool down, and bask in the sun to increase their internal temperatures.

== Diet ==
California kingsnakes are opportunistic feeders and common food items include rodents, birds, other reptiles and amphibians. The &quot;king&quot; in their name refers to their propensity to hunt and eat other snakes, including venomous rattlesnakes; California kingsnakes are naturally resistant to the venom of rattlesnakes. California kingsnakes are non-venomous and kill prey by constriction; they are the strongest constrictors proportionate to body size of any snakes. This adaptation may have evolved in response to the kingsnake&#x27;s preferred reptilian prey, which needs less oxygen to survive an attack by constriction than mammalian prey items.

== Reproduction ==
The California kingsnake is an oviparous internal fertilization animal, meaning it lays eggs, as opposed to giving live birth like some other snakes. Courtship for this kingsnake begins in the spring usually sometime after their hibernation or first shedding and involves the males competing for available females. In order to assert dominance when fighting another male, the California Kingsnake will get onto the other male and proceed biting the other snake. Their mating ritual begins by the male snake vibrating uncontrollably. Eggs are laid between May and August, which is generally 42–63 days after mating; in preparation the female will have chosen a suitable location. The typical clutch size is five to 12 eggs with an average of nine, though clutches of 20 or more eggs are known. The hatchlings usually emerge another 40–65 days later and are approximately eight to 13 inches in length. Newly hatched kingsnakes stay in their nest for about one week, before shedding their first coat of skin and eventually leaving the nest. Adult California kingsnakes are most commonly 2.5–3.5 feet in length, and rarely exceed four feet.

== In captivity ==
The California kingsnake is one of the most popular pet reptiles due to its ease of care, attractive appearance and docile demeanor. Due to natural color and pattern variability between individual snakes, snake enthusiasts have selectively bred for a variety of color patterns known as &quot;morphs&quot;. Wild-type California kingsnakes are technically illegal to sell without special permits in their home state of California. These increased restrictions are due to a law that prohibits sale of native California species within state lines; albino morphs are exempt from this law. The law is loosely enforced.

In the wild, kingsnakes are able to thermoregulate, migrating to warmer areas if needed due to their cold bloodedness. However, in captivity, kingsnakes are not able to freely change locations so most owners use heat lamps, heating pads, and regulate temperatures in their homes to ensure the health of the kingsnake. Temperatures between 70 °F and 85 °F are adequate for kingsnakes in captivity.
== Two-headed Snake ==
A two-headed California kingsnake raised to the age of seventeen at the Arizona State University reptile collection has gained some notoriety as a rare example of serpentine polycephaly. It was born in the wild within the vicinity of the South Mountain Park and Reserve in Arizona, until it was discovered beneath the toilet seat of a public restroom in the foothills of the park and relocated to ASU. This mutation was most likely the case of failed cell division during the process of producing twins.

<text>A cognomen (; : cognomina; from &quot;co-&quot; &quot;together with&quot; and &quot;(g)nomen&quot; &quot;name&quot;) was the third name of a citizen of ancient Rome, under Roman naming conventions. Initially, it was a nickname, but lost that purpose when it became hereditary. Hereditary &quot;cognomina&quot; were used to augment the second name, the &quot;nomen gentilicium&quot; (the family name, or clan name), in order to identify a particular branch within a family or family within a clan. The term has also taken on other contemporary meanings.

==Roman names==

Because of the limited nature of the Latin &quot;praenomen&quot;, the &quot;cognomen&quot; developed to distinguish branches of the family from one another, and occasionally, to highlight an individual&#x27;s achievement, typically in warfare. One example of this is Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, whose cognomen &quot;Magnus&quot; was earned after his military victories under Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship. The &quot;cognomen&quot; was a form of distinguishing people who accomplished important feats, and those who already bore a &quot;cognomen&quot; were awarded another exclusive name, the agnomen. For example, Publius Cornelius Scipio received the agnomen &quot;Africanus&quot; after his victory over the Carthaginian general Hannibal at Zama, Africa (&quot;Africanus&quot; here means &quot;of Africa&quot; in the sense that his fame derives from Africa, rather than being born in Africa, which would have been &quot;Afer&quot;); and the same procedure occurred in the names of Quintus Caecilius Metellus &quot;Numidicus&quot; (conqueror of Numidia) and Quintus Caecilius Metellus &quot;Macedonicus&quot;.

In contrast to the honorary &quot;cognomina&quot; adopted by successful generals, most &quot;cognomina&quot; were based on a physical or personality quirk; for example, &quot;Rufus&quot; meaning &quot;red-haired&quot; or &quot;Scaevola&quot; meaning &quot;left-handed&quot;. Some cognomina were hereditary (such as Caesar among a branch of the Julii, Brutus and Silanus among the Junii, or Pilius and Metellus among the Caecilii): others tended to be individual. And some names appear to have been used both as &quot;praenomen&quot;, &quot;agnomen&quot;, or non-hereditary &quot;cognomen&quot;. For instance, &quot;Vopiscus&quot; was used as both &quot;praenomen&quot; and &quot;cognomen&quot; in the Julii Caesares; likewise &quot;Nero&quot; among the early imperial Claudii, several of whom used the traditional hereditary Claudian cognomen as a praenomen.

The upper-class usually used the &quot;cognomen&quot; to refer to one another.

In present academic context, many prominent ancient Romans are referred to by only their &quot;cognomen&quot;; for example, Cicero (from &quot;cicer&quot; &quot;chickpea&quot;) serves as a shorthand for Marcus Tullius Cicero, and Caesar for Gaius Julius Caesar.

==Contemporary term==

The term &quot;cognomen&quot; (sometimes pluralized &quot;cognomens&quot;) has come into use as an English noun used outside the context of Ancient Rome. According to the 2012 edition of the &quot;Random House Dictionary&quot;, cognomen can mean a &quot;surname&quot; or &quot;any name, especially a nickname&quot;. The basic sense in English is &quot;how one is well known&quot;. For example Alfred the Great. (This is more similar to the Roman use of agnomen than their use of cognomen.)

Catalan &quot;cognom&quot; and Italian &quot;cognome&quot;, derived from the Latin &quot;cognomen&quot;, mean &quot;family name&quot;. Maltese &quot;kunjom&quot; is derived from the Italian version and retains the same meaning.

The term &quot;cognomen&quot; can also be applied to cultures with a clan structure and naming conventions comparable to those of Ancient Rome; thus, hereditary &quot;cognomina&quot; have been described as in use among the Xhosa (Iziduko), the Yoruba (Oriki), and the Zulu (Izibongo).

<doc id="241701" wikidata="Q1890424" url="?curid=241701" title="Youth International Party">
<text>The Youth International Party (YIP), whose members were commonly called Yippies, was an American youth-oriented radical and countercultural revolutionary offshoot of the free speech and anti-war movements of the late 1960s. It was founded on December 31, 1967. They employed theatrical gestures to mock the social status quo, such as advancing a pig called &quot;Pigasus the Immortal&quot; as a candidate for President of the United States in 1968. They have been described as a highly theatrical, anti-authoritarian, and anarchist youth movement of &quot;symbolic politics&quot;.

Since they were well known for street theater, protesting against the criminalization of cannabis in the United States with smoke-ins, and politically themed pranks, they were either ignored or denounced by many of the Old Left. According to ABC News, &quot;The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to as the &#x27;Groucho Marxists&#x27;.&quot;

==Background==
The Yippies had no formal membership or hierarchy. The organization was founded by Abbie and Anita Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Nancy Kurshan, and Paul Krassner, at a meeting in the Hoffmans&#x27; New York apartment on December 31, 1967. According to his own account, Krassner coined the name. &quot;If the press had created &#x27;hippie,&#x27; could not we five hatch the &#x27;yippie&#x27;?&quot; Abbie Hoffman wrote.

Other activists associated with the Yippies include Stew Albert, Judy Gumbo, Ed Sanders, Robin Morgan, Phil Ochs, Robert M. Ockene, William Kunstler, Jonah Raskin, Wavy Gravy, Steve Conliff, Jerome Washington, John Sinclair, Jim Retherford, Dana Beal, Betty (Zaria) Andrew, Joanee Freedom, Danny Boyle, Ben Masel, Tom Forcade, Paul Watson, David Peel, Bill Weinberg, Aron Kay, Tuli Kupferberg, Jill Johnston, Daisy Deadhead, Leatrice Urbanowicz, Bob Fass, Mayer Vishner, Alice Torbush, Patrick K. Kroupa, Judy Lampe, Steve DeAngelo, Dean Tuckerman, Dennis Peron, Jim Fouratt, Steve Wessing, John Penley, Pete Wagner and Brenton Lengel.

A Yippie flag was often seen at anti-war demonstrations. The flag had a black background with a five-pointed red star in the center, and a green cannabis leaf superimposed over it. When asked about the Yippie flag, an anonymous Yippie identified only as &quot;Jung&quot; told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;The black is for anarchy. The red star is for our five point program. And the leaf is for marijuana, which is for getting ecologically stoned without polluting the environment.&quot; This flag is also mentioned in Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;Steal This Book&quot;.

Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin became the most famous Yippies—and bestselling authors—in part due to publicity surrounding the five-month Chicago Seven Conspiracy trial of 1969. They both used the phrase &quot;ideology is a brain disease&quot; to separate the Yippies from mainstream political parties that played the game by the rules. Hoffman and Rubin were arguably the most colorful of the seven defendants accused of criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot at the August 1968 Democratic National Convention. Hoffman and Rubin used the trial as a platform for Yippie antics—at one point, they showed up in court attired in judicial robes.

===Origins===

The term &quot;Yippie&quot; was invented by Krassner, as well Abbie and Anita Hoffman, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1967. Paul Krassner wrote in a January 2007 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:

Anita Hoffman liked the word, but felt that &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other &quot;strait-laced types&quot; needed a more formal name to take the movement seriously. That same night she came up with Youth International Party, because it symbolized the movement and made for a good play on words.

Along with the name Youth International Party, the organization was also simply called Yippie!, as in a shout for joy (with an exclamation mark to express exhilaration). &quot;What does Yippie! mean?&quot; Abbie Hoffman wrote. &quot;Energy – fun – fierceness – exclamation point!&quot;

===First press conference===
The Yippies held their first press conference in New York at the Americana Hotel March 17, 1968, five months before the August 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Judy Collins sang at the press conference. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reported it with an article titled: &quot;Yipes! The Yippies Are Coming!&quot;

==The New Nation concept==

The Yippie &quot;New Nation&quot; concept called for the creation of alternative, counterculture institutions: food co-ops; underground newspapers and zines; free clinics and support groups; artist collectives; potlatches, &quot;swap-meets&quot; and free stores; organic farming/permaculture; pirate radio, bootleg recording and public-access television; squatting; free schools; etc. Yippies believed these cooperative institutions and a radicalized hippie culture would spread until they supplanted the existing system. Many of these ideas/practices came from other (overlapping and intermingling) counter-cultural groups such as the Diggers, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, the Merry Pranksters/Deadheads, the Hog Farm, the Rainbow Family, the Esalen Institute, the Peace and Freedom Party, the White Panther Party and The Farm. There was much overlap, social interaction and cross-pollination within these groups and the Yippies, so there was much crossover membership, as well as similar influences and intentions.

&quot;We are a people. We are a new nation,&quot; YIP&#x27;s New Nation Statement said of the burgeoning hippie movement. &quot;We want everyone to control their own life and to care for one another ... We cannot tolerate attitudes, institutions, and machines whose purpose is the destruction of life, the accumulation of profit.&quot;

The goal was a decentralized, collective, anarchistic nation rooted in the borderless hippie counterculture and its communal ethos. Abbie Hoffman wrote:

We shall not defeat Amerika by organizing a political party. We shall do it by building a new nation—a nation as rugged as the marijuana leaf.

The flag for the &quot;new nation&quot; consisted of a black background with a red five pointed star in the center and a green marijuana leaf superimposed over it (same as the YIP flag).

The Chicago History Museum shows a different flag for the new nation. It is not the marijuana leaf. It has the word NOW under what looks like the all-seeing eye on a pyramid seen on the back of a dollar bill.

==Culture and activism==
The Yippies often paid tribute to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and irreverent pop-culture figures such as the Marx Brothers, James Dean and Lenny Bruce. Many Yippies used nicknames which contained Baby Boomer television or pop references, such as Pogo or Gumby. (Pogo was notable for creating the famous slogan: &quot;We have met the enemy and he is us&quot;—first used on a 1970 Earth Day poster.)

The Yippies&#x27; love of pop-culture was one way to differentiate the Old and New Left, as Jesse Walker writes in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine:

At demonstrations and parades, Yippies often wore face paint or colorful bandannas to keep from being identified in photographs. Other Yippies reveled in the spotlight, allowing their stealthier comrades the anonymity they needed for their pranks.

One cultural intervention that misfired was at Woodstock, with Abbie Hoffman interrupting a performance by The Who, trying to speak against the incarceration of John Sinclair, sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1969 after giving two joints to an undercover narcotics officer. Guitarist Pete Townshend used his guitar to bat Hoffman off the stage.

The Yippies were the first on the New Left to make a point of exploiting mass media. Colorful, theatrical Yippie actions were tailored to attract media coverage and also to provide a stage where people could express the &quot;repressed&quot; Yippie inside them. &quot;We believe every nonyippie is a repressed yippie,&quot; Jerry Rubin wrote in &quot;Do it!&quot; &quot;We try to bring out the yippie in everybody.&quot;

===Early Yippie actions===

Yippies were famous for their sense of humor. Many direct actions were often satirical and elaborate pranks or put-ons. An application to levitate The Pentagon during the October 1967 March on the Pentagon, and a mass protest/mock levitation at the building organized by Rubin, Hoffman and company at the event, helped to set the tone for Yippie when it was established a couple of months later.

Another famous prank just before the term &quot;Yippie&quot; was coined was a guerrilla theater event in New York City on August 24, 1967. Abbie Hoffman and a group of future Yippies managed to get into a tour of the New York Stock Exchange, where they threw fistfuls of real and fake US$ from the balcony of the visitors&#x27; gallery down to the traders below, some of whom booed, while others began to scramble frantically to grab the money as fast as they could. The visitors&#x27; gallery was closed until a glass barrier could be installed, to prevent similar incidents.

On the 40th anniversary of the NYSE event, CNN Money editor James Ledbetter described the now-famous incident:

There was a clash with police on March 22, 1968, where a large group of countercultural youths led by the Yippies descended into Grand Central Station for a &quot;Yip-In&quot;. The night erupted into a violent clash with police that Don McNeill of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called a &quot;pointless confrontation in a box canyon&quot;. A month later, Yippies organized a &quot;Yip-Out,&quot; a be-in style event in Central Park that went off peacefully and drew 20,000 people.

In his book &quot;A Trumpet to Arms: Alternative Media in America&quot;, author David Armstrong points out that the Yippie hybrid of performance art, Guerilla theater and political irreverence was often in direct conflict with the sensibility of the 60s American Left/peace movement:

The Yippies&#x27; unorthodox approach to revolution, which emphasized spontaneity over structure, and media blitz over community organizing, put them almost as much at odds with the rest of the left as with mainstream culture. Wrote (Jerry) Rubin in the &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot;, &quot;The worst thing you can say about a demonstration is that it is boring, and one of the reasons that the peace movement has not grown into a mass movement is that the peace movement—its literature and its events—is a bore. Good theatre is needed to communicate revolutionary content.&quot;

===House Un-American Activities Committee===
The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman of the Yippies in 1967, and again in the aftermath of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The Yippies used media attention to make a mockery of the proceedings: Rubin came to one session dressed as an American Revolutionary War soldier, and passed out copies of the United States Declaration of Independence to people in attendance.

On another occasion, police stopped Hoffman at the building entrance and arrested him for wearing an American flag. Hoffman quipped for the press, &quot;I regret that I have but one shirt to give for my country&quot;, paraphrasing the last words of revolutionary patriot Nathan Hale; meanwhile Rubin, who was wearing a matching Viet Cong flag, shouted that the police were Communists for not arresting him also.

According to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;:

In the fifties, the most effective sanction was terror. Almost any publicity from HUAC meant the &#x27;blacklist.&#x27; Without a chance to clear his name, a witness would suddenly find himself without friends and without a job. But it is not easy to see how in 1969 a HUAC blacklist could terrorize an SDS activist. Witnesses like Jerry Rubin have openly boasted of their contempt for American institutions. A subpoena from HUAC would be unlikely to scandalize Abbie Hoffman or his friends.

==Chicago &#x27;68==

Yippie theatrics culminated at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. YIP planned a six-day Festival of Life – a celebration of the counterculture and a protest against the state of the nation. This was supposed to counter the &quot;Convention of Death.&quot; This promised to be &quot;the blending of pot and politics into a political grass leaves movement – a cross-fertilization of the hippie and New Left philosophies.&quot; Yippies&#x27; sensational statements before the convention were part of the theatrics, including a tongue-in-cheek threat to put LSD in Chicago&#x27;s water supply. &quot;We will fuck on the beaches! ... We demand the Politics of Ecstasy! ... Abandon the Creeping Meatball! ... And all the time &#x27;Yippie! Chicago – August 25–30.&#x27;&quot; First on a list of Yippie demands: &quot;An immediate end to the war in Vietnam.&quot;

Yippie organizers hoped that well-known musicians would participate in the Festival of Life and draw a crowd of tens if not hundreds of thousands from across the country. The city of Chicago refused to issue any permits for the festival and most musicians withdrew from the project. Of the rock bands who had agreed to perform, only the MC5 came to Chicago to play and their set was cut short by a clash between the audience of a couple thousand and police. Phil Ochs and several other singer-songwriters also performed during the festival.

In response to the Festival of Life and other anti-war demonstrations during the Democratic convention, Chicago police repeatedly clashed with protesters, as many millions of viewers watched the extensive TV coverage of the events. On the evening of August 28 the police attacked the protesters in front of the Conrad Hilton hotel as the demonstrators chanted &quot;The whole world is watching&quot;. This was a &quot;police riot,&quot; concluded the US National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, stating:&quot;On the part of the police there was enough wild club swinging, enough cries of hatred, enough gratuitous beating to make the conclusion inescapable that individual policemen, and lots of them, committed violent acts far in excess of the requisite force for crowd dispersal or arrest.&quot;

===The conspiracy trial===

Following the convention, eight protesters were charged with conspiracy to incite the riots. Their 
trial, which lasted five months, was heavily publicized. The Chicago Seven represented a cross-section of the New Left, including Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.

In his book, &quot;American Fun: Four Centuries of Joyous Revolt&quot;, John Beckman writes:

Never mind &quot;Hair&quot;, the so-called Chicago Eight (then Seven) trial was the countercultural performance of the sixties. Guerrilla theater stared down courtroom farce to decide the civil dispute of the era: the Movement vs. the Establishment. The eight defendants seemed finically chosen to represent the world of dissent: SDS leaders Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden (who had authored &quot;The Port Huron Statement&quot;); graduate students Lee Weiner and John Froines; portly fifty-four-year-old Christian socialist David Dellinger; Yippies Rubin and Hoffman; and—briefly--Black Panther Bobby Seale. &quot;Conspire, hell,&quot; Hoffman quipped. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t agree on lunch.&quot;

Several other Yippies – including Stew Albert, Wolfe Lowenthal, Brad Fox and Robin Palmer – were among another 18 activists named as &quot;unindicted co-conspirators&quot; in the case. While five of the defendants were initially convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot, all convictions were soon reversed in appeal court. Defendants Hoffman and Rubin became popular authors and public speakers, spreading Yippie militancy and comedy wherever they appeared. When Hoffman appeared on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, for example, he wore a shirt with an American flag design, prompting CBS to black out his image when the show aired.

==The Yippie movement==
The Youth International Party quickly spread beyond Rubin, Hoffman and the other founders. YIP had chapters all over the US and in other countries, with particularly active groups in New York City, Vancouver, Washington, D.C., Detroit, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Tucson, Houston, Austin, Columbus, Dayton, Chicago, Berkeley, San Francisco and Madison. There were YIP conferences through the 1970s, beginning with a &quot;New Nation Conference&quot; in Madison, Wisconsin in 1971.

On the final day of the Madison conference, April 4, 1971, hundreds of riot police broke up a block party organized by local Yippies to cap the event, resulting in a street clash between Yippies and police.

===Street protests===
During an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C., on November 15, 1969, East Coast Yippies led thousands of youths in the storming of the Justice Department building.

On August 6, 1970, L.A. Yippies invaded Disneyland, hoisting the New Nation flag at City Hall and taking over Tom Sawyer&#x27;s Island. While riot police confronted the Yippies, the theme park was closed early for only the second time in the park&#x27;s history (the first being shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy.). As many as 23 of the 200 Yippies attending were arrested.

Vancouver Yippies invaded the US border town of Blaine, Washington, on May 9, 1970, to protest Richard Nixon&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia and the shooting of students at Kent State.

Columbus Yippies were charged with inciting the rioting that occurred in the city on May 11, 1972, in response to Nixon&#x27;s mining of North Vietnam&#x27;s Haiphong harbor. They were acquitted.

YIP was a member of the coalition of anti-Vietnam War activists who, over several days in early May 1971, tried to shut down the US government by occupying intersections and bridges in Washington, D.C. The May Day protests resulted in the largest mass arrest in American history.

A frequent &#x27;national&#x27; complaint among Yippies was that the New York &#x27;central HQ&#x27; chapter acted as if other chapters did not exist and kept them out of the decision-making process. At one point, at a YIP conference in Ohio in 1972, Yippies voted to &#x27;exclude&#x27; Abbie and Jerry as official spokespersons from the party, since they had become too famous and rich.

In 1972, Yippies and Zippies (a younger YIP radical breakaway faction whose &quot;guiding spirit&quot; was Tom Forcade) staged protests at the Republican and Democratic Conventions in Miami Beach. Some of the Miami protests were larger and more militant than the ones in Chicago in 1968. After Miami, the Zippies evolved back into Yippies.

In 1973, Yippies marched on the Manhattan home of Watergate conspirator John Mitchell:

... five hundred die-hard Yippies staged one last march on the Mitchell home, no longer the Watergate but a grand apartment building on Manhattan&#x27;s Fifth Avenue. &quot;Free Martha Mitchell!&quot; they chanted. &quot;Fuck John!&quot; When the Mitchells finally appeared at the window to see what all the commotion was about, the stoners cherished their last &quot;eye-to-eyeball confrontation with Mr. Law &#x27;n&#x27; Order.&quot; To commemorate the moment, they placed a giant marijuana joint on the Mitchells&#x27; doorstep.

Yippies regularly protested at US presidential inaugurations, with a particularly strong presence at the 1973 inauguration of Richard Nixon. Yippies also demonstrated at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, as well as the subsequent 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, where 99 Yippies were arrested:

=== Smoke-ins ===
Yippies organized marijuana &quot;smoke-ins&quot; across North America through the 1970s and into the 1980s. The first YIP smoke-in was attended by 25,000 in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 1970. There was a culture clash when many of the hippie protesters strolled en masse into the nearby &quot;Honor America Day&quot; festivities with Billy Graham and Bob Hope.

On August 7, 1971, a Yippie smoke-in in Vancouver was attacked by police, resulting in the Gastown Riot, one of the most famous protests in Canadian history.

The annual July 4 Yippie smoke-in in Washington, D.C., became a counterculture tradition.

===Alternative culture===

Yippies organized alternative institutions in their counterculture communities. In Tucson, Yippies operated a free store; in Vancouver, Yippies established the People&#x27;s Defense Fund to provide legal help for the often-harassed hippie community; in Milwaukee, Yippies helped launch the city&#x27;s first food co-op.

Many Yippies were involved in the underground press. Some were the editors of major underground newspapers or alternative magazines, including Yippies Abe Peck (&quot;Chicago Seed&quot;), Jeff Shero Nightbyrd (New York&#x27;s &quot;Rat&quot; and &quot;Austin Sun&quot;), Paul Krassner (&quot;The Realist&quot;), Robin Morgan (&quot;Ms. magazine&quot;), Steve Conliff (&quot;Purple Berries&quot;, &quot;Sour Grapes&quot; and &quot;Columbus Free Press)&quot;, Bob Mercer (&quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; and &quot;Yellow Journal&quot;), Henry Weissborn (&quot;ULTRA&quot;), James Retherford (&quot;The Rag&quot;), Mayer Vishner (&quot;LA Weekly&quot;), Matthew Landy Steen and Stew Albert (&quot;Berkeley Barb&quot; and &quot;Berkeley Tribe&quot;), Tom Forcade (&quot;Underground Press Syndicate&quot; and &quot;High Times&quot;) and Gabrielle Schang (&quot;Alternative Media&quot;). New York Yippie Coca Crystal hosted the popular cable TV program &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Dance You Can Keep Your Revolution.&quot;

Yippies were active in alternative music and movies. Singer-songwriters Phil Ochs and David Peel were Yippies. &quot;I helped design the party, formulate the idea of what Yippie was going to be, in the early part of 1968,&quot; Ochs testified at the Chicago Eight trial.

The strange, legendary cult film &quot;Medicine Ball Caravan&quot; (partly financed by Tom Forcade), chronicled Yippie drop-outs and a variety of other fascinating and dynamic characters of the era. The movie title was later controversially changed to &quot;We Have Come for your Daughters&quot;.

Radical musicians usually found enthusiastic audiences at Yippie-sponsored events and frequently offered to play. YIP-affiliated John Sinclair managed Detroit&#x27;s proto-punk band the MC5, who played in Lincoln Park during protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. In 1970, Pete Seeger played a Vancouver Yippie rally against construction of a highway through Jericho Beach Park. The first-ever concert by the influential and iconic proto-punk band the New York Dolls, was a Yippie benefit to raise funds to pay legal fees for one of Dana Beal&#x27;s marijuana arrests in the 1970s.

The Youth International Party founded the US branch of the Rock Against Racism movement in 1979. Rock Against Racism USA later morphed into the critically acclaimed, Yippie-organized, widely recognized national Rock Against Reagan tour in 1983. Well-known bands on the tour included Michelle Shocked, the Dead Kennedys, the Crucifucks, MDC, Cause for Alarm, Toxic Reasons and Static Disruptors. A young Whoopi Goldberg performed stand-up comedy (as did Will Durst) at the San Francisco R-A-R show.

Vancouver Yippies Ken Lester and David Spaner were the managers of Canada&#x27;s two most notorious political punk bands, D.O.A. (Lester) and The Subhumans (Spaner). New York Yippie/High Times publisher Tom Forcade financed one of the first movies about punk rock, &quot;D.O.A.&quot;, featuring footage of the Sex Pistols&#x27; 1978 tour of America.

Infamous Baltimore Yippie John Waters became a renowned independent filmmaker (Pink Flamingos, Polyester, Hairspray), once claiming in an interview that the Yippies influenced his irreverent sense of style: &quot;I was a Yippie agitator, and I wanted to look like Little Richard. I dressed like a hippie pimp back then, because punk wasn&#x27;t around yet.&quot;

===Pranking the system===
Yippies mocked the system and its authority. The Youth International Party, having nominated a pig (Pigasus) for US president in 1968, famously ran Nobody for President as its &#x27;official&#x27; candidate in 1976.

Vancouver Yippie Betty &quot;Zaria&quot; Andrew ran as the Youth International Party&#x27;s candidate for mayor in 1970. One of her campaign promises was to repeal every law, including the law of gravity so that everyone could get high. That same year, Berkeley Yippie Stew Albert ran for sheriff of Alameda County, challenging the incumbent sheriff to a high-noon duel and receiving 65,000 votes.

In 1970, Detroit Yippies went to city hall and applied for a permit to blow up the General Motors building. After the permit was denied, the Yippies said that it just goes to show you can&#x27;t work within the system to change the system. &quot;This destroys my last hope for legal channels,&quot; said Detroit Yippie Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash.

Some Yippies, including Robin Morgan, Nancy Kurshan, Sharon Krebs and Judy Gumbo, were active in the Guerilla theatre feminist group W.I.T.C.H. (Women&#x27;s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell), which combined &quot;theatricality, humor, and activism.&quot;

On November 7, 1970, Jerry Rubin and London Yippies took over &quot;The Frost Programme&quot; when he was the guest on the popular British host&#x27;s TV program. In all the chaos, a Yippie fired a water pistol into host David Frost&#x27;s open mouth, the broadcaster called for a commercial break and the show was over. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s banner headline: &quot;THE FROST FREAKOUT.&quot;

===Pie-throwing===

Pie-throwing as a political act was invented by Yippies. The first political pie throwing was carried out in Bloomington, Indiana, October 14, 1969, when Jim Retherford, former underground newspaper editor and ghost writer of Jerry Rubin&#x27;s Do It!, landed a cream pie in the face of former UC Berkeley president Clark Kerr. Retherford was also the first to be arrested. The next pie was thrown by Tom Forcade, who nailed a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Obscenity and Pornography in 1970. Columbus Yippie Steve Conliff pied Ohio Governor James Rhodes in 1977 to protest the Kent State shootings.

Aron &quot;The Pieman&quot; Kay became the best-known Yippie pie-thrower. Kay&#x27;s many targets included Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York City Mayor Abe Beame, conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis, ex-CIA head William Colby, National Review publisher/editor William F. Buckley, and the owner of disco Studio 54, Steve Rubell.

===Nobody for President and &quot;None of the Above&quot;===

Perhaps one of the swan songs of Yippies was a groundbreaking effort to place a new voting option, None of the Above, on the election ballot in Santa Barbara County, in California, by the Isla Vista Municipal Advisory Council in 1976. This represented an incipient libertarian impulse of Yippies and the first example in the United States of this election ballot alternative, in what one of the resolution&#x27;s two co-sponsors, Matthew Steen, described as an &quot;anti-institutional Yippie up-yours.&quot; Years earlier Steen had been a Yippie activist with Stew Albert, as a reporter with the &quot;Berkeley Tribe&quot;. This novel motion was adopted unanimously by the council, having a ripple effect across the country, with voters in Nevada approving this option in a change to state election laws in 1986.

In 1976, national Yippies took a cue from Isla Vistans, backing Nobody for President, a campaign that took on a life of its own in the post-Watergate malaise of the mid-70s. The Yippie campaign slogan: &quot;Nobody&#x27;s perfect.&quot; (Meanwhile, in a strange twist of Yippie fate, Matthew Steen had become treasurer of a student-led campaign to elect Jerry Brown for president, competing against both &quot;Nobody for President&quot; and Jimmy Carter during the presidential primary campaign of that year.)

From the experimental combination of Isla Vista local politics, presidential campaigns and the Yippies, the name and spirit of this unexpected ballot initiative spread quickly—in the form of None of the Above music festivals, radio and television shows, rock bands, T-shirts, buttons, (decades later) countless websites and other related social phenomena. The die-hard dedication to the &#x27;option&#x27; of Nobody for President and None of the Above has not abated since the counter-cultural 70s, but has only grown, unexpectedly taking the Yippie legacy into a new century and succeeding generations.

== Writings ==
&quot;An exegesis on women&#x27;s liberation&quot; by the Women&#x27;s Caucus within the Youth International Party was included in the 1970 anthology &quot;Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

In June 1971, Abbie Hoffman and Al Bell started the pioneer phreak magazine &quot;The Youth International Party Line&quot; (&quot;YIPL&quot;). Later, the name was changed to &quot;TAP&quot; for &quot;Technological American Party&quot; or &quot;Technological Assistance Program.&quot;

Milwaukee Yippies published &quot;Street Sheet,&quot; the first of the anarchist zines later to become so popular in many cities. &quot;The Open Road,&quot; an internationally known journal of the anti-authoritarian left, was founded by a core of Vancouver Yippies.

The semi-official Yippie house organ, &quot;The Yipster Times&quot;, was founded by Dana Beal in 1972 and published in New York City; the name was changed to &quot;Overthrow&quot; in 1979.

The mercurial Yippie-turned-Zippie Tom Forcade founded the very-successful &quot;High Times&quot; magazine in 1974. So many writers for &quot;Yipster Times&quot; would go on to write for &quot;High Times&quot;, it was often referred to as the farm team.

The most famous writing to come out of the Yippie movement is Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;Steal This Book&quot;, which is considered to be a guidebook in causing general mischief and capturing the spirit of the Yippie movement. Hoffman is also the author of &quot;Revolution for the Hell of It&quot; which has been called the original Yippie book. This book claims that there were no actual yippies, and that the name was just a term used to create a myth.

Jerry Rubin published his account of the Yippie movement in his book &quot;Do IT!: Scenarios of Revolution.&quot;

Books on Yippie by Yippies include &quot;Woodstock Nation&quot; and &quot;Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture&quot; (Abbie Hoffman), &quot;We Are Everywhere&quot; (Jerry Rubin), &quot;Trashing&quot; (Anita Hoffman), &quot;Who the Hell is Stew Albert?&quot; (Stew Albert), &quot;Confessions of a Raving, Unconfined Nut&quot; (Paul Krassner) and &quot;Shards of God: A Novel of the Yippies&quot; (Ed Sanders). Some other books about that era: &quot;Woodstock Census: The Nationwide Survey of the Sixties Generation&quot; (Deanne Stillman and Rex Weiner), &quot;The Panama Hat Trail&quot; (Tom Miller),&quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home: America in the Great Stoned Age, 1945-2000&quot; (Martin Torgoff), &quot;Groove Tube: Sixties Television and the Youth Rebellion&quot; (Aniko Bodroghkozy), and &quot;The Ballad of Ken and Emily: or, Tales from the Counterculture&quot; (Ken Wachsberger).

&quot;Buy This Book&quot;, written and illustrated by political cartoonist and post-1960s Yippie activist Pete Wagner, who distributed copies of the &quot;Yipster Times&quot; on the University of Minnesota campus in the mid-1970s, was promoted by Hoffman, who said the book &quot;manages to reach to the limits of bad taste.&quot; &quot;Buy This Too&quot; recounts efforts by a guerrilla street theater gang named the &quot;1985 Brain Trust&quot; to &quot;fight the New Right with Yippie-like myth-making tactics.&quot; The Brain Trust was inspired by a series of meetings and interviews between Wagner and Paul Krassner in Minneapolis during May 1981, as Krassner performed stand-up comedy at Dudley Riggs&#x27; Instant Theater Company.

In 1983, a group of Yippies published &quot;Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago &#x27;68, to 1984&quot; (Bleecker Publishing), a large, &#x27;phone-book sized anthology&#x27; (733 pages) of Yippie history, including journalistic accounts from both alternative and mainstream media, as well as many personal stories and essays. Includes countless photographs, old leaflets and posters, &#x27;underground&#x27; comics, newspaper clippings, and various other historical ephemera. The editors (often doubling as authors) officially called themselves &quot;The New Yippie Book Collective&quot;; which included Steve Conliff (who wrote over half the volume), Dana Beal (head archivist), Grace Nichols, Daisy Deadhead, Ben Masel, Alice Torbush, Karen Wachsman, and Aron Kay. It is still in print.

== Later years ==
HBO docudrama film &quot;&quot; was first broadcast in 1987.

In 1989, Abbie Hoffman, who had been suffering intermittent bouts of depression, committed suicide with alcohol and about 150 phenobarbital pills.

By contrast, Jerry Rubin became a fast-talking (and by all accounts, fairly successful) stockbroker and showed no regrets. In 1994 he was fatally injured by a car while jaywalking. By the age of 50, Rubin had broken with many of his previous countercultural views; he was interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which described him as a &quot;yippie-turned-conspicuous-yuppie.&quot; In the interview, he stated that &quot;Until me, nobody had really taken off their clothes and screamed out loud, &#x27;It&#x27;s O.K. to make money!&#x27;&quot;

In 2000, a Hollywood film based on the life of Abbie Hoffman, titled &quot;Steal This Movie&quot; (spoofing the title of his book, &quot;Steal This Book&quot;), was released to mixed reviews, with Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio in the title role. Noted film critic Roger Ebert gave the movie a positive review, remarking that although it is often difficult to credibly bring historic events to life, he believed the movie succeeded:

The Yippies continued as a small movement into the early 2000s. The New York chapter was known for their annual marches for decades in New York City to legalize marijuana; NYC Yippie Dana Beal started the Global Marijuana March in 1999. Beal also continued to crusade for the use of Ibogaine to treat heroin addicts. Another Yippie, A.J. Weberman, continued the deconstruction of the poetry of Bob Dylan and speculation about tramps on the Grassy Knoll through various websites. Weberman has for a long time been active in the Jewish Defense Organization.

Throughout this decade, NYC Yippies frequently joined in local anti-gentrification protests over the continuing transformation of New York&#x27;s Lower East Side.

In 2008, there was a very public feud between A.J. Weberman and fellow founding-Yippie, popular New York radio host Bob Fass of WBAI. Related incidents briefly brought the Yippies back into the media, particularly since they coincided with the public release of new movie.

Chicago 10 was an animated movie about the Chicago riots that drew national attention. The film, which featured Hank Azaria as Abbie Hoffman and Mark Ruffalo as Jerry Rubin, attracted interest in the topic from a new generation. In October 2008, it appeared nationally on PBS.

Vancouver Yippie Bob Sarti&#x27;s play &quot;Yippies in Love&quot;, premiered in June 2011.

==Yippie Museum and Cafe==
In 2004, the Yippies, along with the National AIDS Brigade, purchased the long-time Yippie &quot;headquarters&quot; (which had initially been acquired by squatting) at 9 Bleecker Street in New York City for $1.2 million. After official purchase, it was converted into the &quot;Yippie Museum/Café and Gift Shop&quot;, housing a multitude of counter-cultural and leftist memorabilia from all over the world, as well as providing an independently operated café that featured live music on scheduled nights. The cafe closed in summer 2011 and reopened in December the same year with a renovated basement. The museum was chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York.

According to the original curator&#x27;s message, the museum was founded &quot;to preserve the history of the Youth International Party and all of its offshoots.&quot; The Board of Directors: Dana Beal, Aron Kay, David Peel, William Propp, Paul DeRienzo, and A. J. Weberman.

George Martinez was a semi-frequent speaker at the Yippies&#x27; Open-Mic, known as &quot;Occupational Hazards/The People&#x27;s Soapbox.&quot;

In Summer 2013, The Yippie Cafe officially closed. At the beginning of 2014, the Yippie building (Museum) at #9 Bleecker was sold, closed and permanently cleaned out; most of the memorabilia and historic materials dispersed among the remaining New York Yippies.

As of 2017, the old Yippie building at #9 Bleecker had been totally transformed into a successful Bowery-area Boxing club called &quot;Overthrow&quot;, deliberately and artfully retaining much of its original Yippie/60s-revolutionary decor. Tourists still drop by to see it.

== &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot; ==

In 2020, one of the most widely popular pieces of media about the Yippie Movement and particularly the infamous trial was released on Netflix. The film was called “The Trial of the Chicago 7” and received an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes, which reflected the audience&#x27;s wide praise for the movie. It essentially depicts the peaceful protest that turned into the violent clash that will stamp Yippie history forever, as well as the notorious trial that followed. The film follows this entire scenario, with an in-depth back story for all the characters and scenes that depict the atrocity and excitement of the situation. It follows the film&#x27;s two main characters and founders of the Youth International party, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, as well as the other 5 activists that stood trial. There is truly a star-studded cast, with Sasha Baron Cohen playing Hoffman and Jeremy Strong playing Rubin, while another prominent actor Eddie Redmayen plays activist Tom Hayden. The film was directed by Aaron Sorkin and won a variety of awards, including the “Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture” and the “Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay”. The movie was originally intended to be released in theaters, but the COVID-19 pandemic led to the distribution rights being sold to Netflix. Netflix bought the rights to the film for a sum of 56 million, while the production of the film cost around $ 35 million. 

81 year old Judy Gumbo was a member of the original Yippie movement and had nothing but positive affirmations for the film. After watching “The Trial of the Chicago 7” she states “it’s a positive and affirming movie. It brings up things, like racism and that Bobby Seale was targeted. I think the people who are unhappy with it are uber-idealistic and who don’t get, as I, a Yippie, does, the effect I believe it will have on the majority of Americans who watch it.” She believes that the issues discussed in the movie are as relevant now as they were in the 1960’s, which is why the film is so important and impactful.

<doc id="241706" wikidata="Q5123776" url="?curid=241706" title="City of London School for Girls">
<text>The City of London School for Girls (CLSG) is a private school in the Barbican in the City of London. It is the partner school of the all-boys City of London School and the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School. All three schools receive funding from the City&#x27;s Cash. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC) and the Girls&#x27; Schools Association.

==History==
The school was founded using a bequest by William Ward, a merchant of Brixton, in 1881 and opened in Carmelite Street in 1894. It was his conviction that girls should be given a broad and liberal education with an emphasis on scholarship; he left a third of his fortune to the City of London to fund the foundation of a girls&#x27; school. The school is still administered by the Corporation of London, and the Board of Governors is appointed by the Court of Common Council. The school also receives financial support from the City Livery Companies as well as banks and other City firms. The school has strong links with the all-boys City of London School, 15 minutes&#x27; walk away, which likewise is run by the Corporation.

The school moved to new buildings in the Barbican Estate in 1969.

== General ==

The school has an excellent academic reputation. In 2018, it was rated by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as the second-best independent school in the UK, based on GCSE and A-Level results. It has previously topped The Times A-level league table of England&#x27;s independent schools and its table of prep schools. It has contributed two female participants to UK International Mathematical Olympiad teams.

The Good Schools Guide describes City as having a &quot;famously diverse mix of pupils and staff as befits the school&#x27;s situation in the heart of the city&quot;. The school previously had a small prep school, but this was dissolved in 2022 to form part of the new City Junior School. The school admits some students at 16. 

Fees are currently £7,926 per term for the senior school exclusive of school lunches, and entrance is by examination. Approximately 25% of students receive bursary assistance of some kind, including full bursaries.

The school is secular, yet has mildly Christian traditions, with an optional annual Carol Service in the neighbouring St Giles&#x27; Church. There is a Jewish Society as well as an Asian Society, an Oriental Society and an African-Caribbean Society.

City has a house system which consists of four houses. The four houses are Fleet (after Fleet Street), Tudor (after Tudor Street), St. Bride (after St. Bride church on Fleet Street), Ward (after William Ward, the founder of the school). There are a variety of inter-house competitions, including Drama, Debating, Maths, Art, Music, the Inter-House Quiz and at Sports Day, as well as several other sports competitions throughout the year.

There have been 12 headmistresses of the school; the headmistress is Jenny Brown.

== Extracurricular ==
The school is adjacent to the Barbican Arts Centre and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and has a strong focus on the arts. The school offers joint music scholarships with the Guildhall Music School. Since 2005, the school has held a drama festival called Moat Fest.

The school has a swimming pool, a lecture theatre, two netball/tennis courts, a drama studio, an all weather playing field and an indoor gym with climbing wall, as well as a gym complete with exercise equipment such as treadmills and weights. The school has several times won the national European Youth Parliament competition and has a debating programme.

The school offers language exchanges to France, Spain, Germany and China, as well as other travelling opportunities through schemes such as World Challenge, which has seen girls go recently to Venezuela. Duke of Edinburgh Award expeditions have been confined to the UK since 2001 when student Amelia Ward was killed whilst abseiling on a Duke of Edinburgh trip in South Africa. They regularly have exchanges from countries such as Australia, China, Germany, France, and Spain.

It is the only school to have won the international Kids&#x27; Lit Quiz twice, in 2010 and 2014.

== Buildings ==
The school is situated in a Grade II listed building in the Barbican.

The school has attracted controversy with recent expansion plans. In January 2018 plans were advanced to expand prep school for four- to seven-year-olds in an underground car park of an adjoining tower block, Thomas More House. The plans met with significant local opposition. A further plan for expansion was prepared by Nicholas Hare Architects, again meeting with strong opposition, and was subsequently abandoned.

<text>The Curonian language (; ; ), or Old Curonian, was a Baltic language spoken by the Curonians, a Baltic tribe who inhabited Courland (now western Latvia and northwestern Lithuania).

==Classification==
Curonian was an Indo-European language of the Baltic branch, as proven by Jānis Endzelīns.

Curonian&#x27;s relation to other Baltic languages is unclear:
*Some scholars consider it to have been an East Baltic language, intermediate between Lithuanian and Latvian.
* Others, like Vytautas Mažiulis, classify it as a West Baltic language that became closer to the Eastern branch due to extensive contact.
* Linguist Eduard Vääri argues that it is possible that Curonians were Baltic Finns.

== History ==
Old Curonian disappeared in the course of the 16th century.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Baltic states saw a revival of scientific and cultural interest in extinct Baltic languages and tribes, including Yotvingian, Curonian, and Old Prussian.

==Lexicon==
Samogitian words such as (mosquito), (duck), (swallow), (skylark), (hare), (stone), (marsh), and (winter wheat) are considered to be of Curonian origin.

Further words show similarities with Old Prussian: and Old Prussian: compared to , , all meaning wheel.

==Corpus==
===Evidence from other languages===
Curonian left substrata in western dialects of the Latvian and Lithuanian, namely the Samogitian dialect. No written documents in this language are known, but some ancient Lithuanian texts from western regions show some Curonian influence. According to Lithuanian linguist Zigmas Zinkevičius, long and intense Curonian–Lithuanian bilingualism existed.

===Onomastics===
There are only few onomastics in the region considered to have been inhabited by the Curonians.

There are attested names of Curonian noblemen such as: , , , , .

===Potential text in Curonian===
Additionally, the Pater Noster reported by Simon Grunau is speculated to be in Curonian.

<doc id="241713" wikidata="Q710851" url="?curid=241713" title="Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 237 BC)">
<text>Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (c. 277 BC202 BC), son of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 264 BC), was consul in 237 BC, fighting the Gauls in northern Italy. He was censor in 231 BC, and again consul in 224 BC, when he subdued the Boii. He was a praetor in 215 BC and in 213 BC Master of Horse in the dictatorship of Gaius Claudius Centho. 

His brother was Gnaeus Fulvius Flaccus, who was praetor in 212 BC. He fought in the Battle of Herdonia (212 BC) and went to exile in 211 BC.

His sons were Quintus Fulvius Flaccus (consul 179 BC) and Lucius Manlius Acidinus Fulvianus (consul 179 BC), was adopted into the Manlia gens, probably by Lucius Manlius Acidinus - the only instance of two brothers holding the consulship at the same time during the Republic.

He was again consul in 212 BC, during the Second Punic War, winning a victory over Hanno, son of Bomilcar and capturing his camp at Beneventum. He was defeated by Hannibal at the first Battle of Capua, then captured Capua in 211 BC while serving as a proconsul. In his fourth term as consul (209 BC), he retook Lucania and Bruttium. He opposed the African expedition of Scipio Africanus in 205 BC, and he died sometime not long thereafter.

Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was one of the three candidates for the position of Pontifex Maximus c. 212 BC, when he and another senior candidate Titus Manlius Torquatus, both former censors, were pipped at the post by a younger man, Publius Licinius Crassus who was not yet a curule aedile and thus probably aged in his middle thirties. Nevertheless, Flaccus made the new Pontifex his own Master of the Horse some years later.

Flaccus was known for his severity towards the disloyal citizens of Capua, of whom he had the senior men executed and the rest of the citizenry condemned to slavery for their disloyalty to Rome. According to Livy, the Capuans complained of his behavior to the Roman Senate, which, however, ruled that Flaccus was within his rights.

Flaccus was the grandfather of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, consul in 125 BC, who was an ardent supporter of the Brothers Gracchi. He attempted to warn Tiberius Gracchus of the plots against his life on the day that he was killed; in 121 BC, having supported Gaius Gracchus in his reform program and tried to lead an armed resistance against the Senate, he and his elder son were tracked down and executed (beheaded) without trial on the orders of the consul Lucius Opimius; the youngest son, too young to have participated in any plotting or armed revolt, died in prison, again without trial (another son was apparently the father of Fulvia, third wife of Mark Antony). The grandfather, a stern conservative, could probably never have imagined the fates of his descendants.

<doc id="241714" wikidata="Q203644" url="?curid=241714" title="Tony Miles">
<text>Anthony John Miles (23 April 1955 – 12 November 2001) was an English chess player and the first Englishman to earn the Grandmaster title.

==Early and personal life==
Miles was an only child. He was born on 23 April 1955 in Edgbaston, a suburb of Birmingham, and attended King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. He was married and divorced twice, and had no children. Miles&#x27;s first wife was Jana Hartston, who had previously been married to William Hartston.

==Early chess career==
He learned the game of chess early in life and made good progress nationally, taking the titles of British under-14 Champion and under-21 Champion in 1968 and 1971, respectively.

In 1973, Miles won the silver medal at the World Junior Chess Championship at Teesside, his first important event against international competition. Both he and compatriot Michael Stean defeated the tournament winner Alexander Beliavsky, but were unable to match the Soviet player&#x27;s ruthlessness in dispatching lesser opponents. Miles went on to win this prestigious title the following year in Manila, while a mathematics undergraduate of the University of Sheffield.

Taking the decision to pursue the game professionally, Miles did not complete his studies; however, in 1975, he was awarded an MA by the university in respect of his chess achievements.

==Later career==
In 1976, Miles became the first UK-born, chess grandmaster, narrowly beating Raymond Keene to the accolade. The naturalised, German-born Jacques Mieses was awarded the GM title in 1950, while Keith Richardson had been awarded the GM title for correspondence chess earlier in the 1970s. For his achievement, Miles won a £5,000 prize, put up by wealthy businessman and chess backer Jim Slater.
Miles had a string of good results in the late 1970s and 1980s. He matured into a world-class player and won games against high-calibre opponents such as former World Chess Champions Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky.

In 1980, at the European Team Championship in Skara, he beat reigning World Champion Anatoly Karpov with Black, using the extremely unorthodox opening 1. e4 a6!?, the St. George Defence. It is often said that Miles learned the line from offbeat-openings enthusiast Michael Basman, but in his book &quot;Play the St. George&quot;, Basman asserts there is no truth to this. Miles beat Karpov again three years later in Bath in a game that was part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Master Game&quot; series, but it was shown only by the (co-producing) German television network due to a BBC technicians&#x27; strike at the time of broadcast.

Miles won the British Championship just once, in 1982 when the event was held in Torquay. His prime time as a chess player was the mid-1980s. On 20 May 1984 in Roetgen (Germany), Miles set a European record in blind simultaneous chess with 22 games (+10−2=10); this record was not broken until 2009. On the January 1984 Elo rating list, he ranked No. 18 in the world with a rating of 2599. One of his best results occurred at the Tilburg tournament in 1984, where, from a strong field, he emerged sole winner by a clear margin of one and one-half points. The following year, he tied for first at the same event with Robert Hübner and Viktor Korchnoi, playing several of his games while lying face down on a table, having injured his back. The result was controversial, as many of Miles&#x27;s opponents felt they were distracted by the unusual circumstances. A string of good performances culminated in a good showing on the January 1986 Elo rating list, where he climbed to a best-ever position of World No. 9 with a rating of 2610. During this period, there was considerable rivalry with John Nunn over who was the United Kingdom&#x27;s best player, the two protagonists regularly leapfrogging each other in the world rankings. Nigel Short and Jon Speelman soon added to the competition, as the English national squad entered its strongest period.

Never able to qualify out of the Interzonal stages into the Candidates&#x27; series, Miles eventually lost the race to become the first British Candidate when Short did so in 1985. However, he retained top board for England at the Thessaloniki and Dubai Olympiads of 1984 and 1986, helping the team to silver medals at each.

Against Garry Kasparov, Miles had little success, not winning a game against him, and losing a 1986 match in Basel by the score of 5½–½. Following this encounter, Miles commented &quot;I thought I was playing the world champion, not a monster with a thousand eyes who sees everything&quot; (some sources alternatively quote Miles as having the opinion that Kasparov had 22 or 27 eyes).
After he was hospitalised because of a mental breakdown in late 1987, Miles moved to the United States. He finished last in the 1988 U.S. Championship, but continued to play there and had some good results. In 1991, he played in the Championship of Australia, but eventually moved back to England and began to represent his native country again. He was equal first at the very strong Cappelle-la-Grande Open in 1994, 1995, and 1997, and caused a shock at the PCA Intel Rapid Chess Grand Prix in London in 1995, when he knocked out Vladimir Kramnik in the first round and Loek van Wely in the second. His bid to win the event was finally halted in the semifinal by English teammate Michael Adams.
There were four notable victories at the Capablanca Memorial in Cuba (1994, 1995, 1996, and 1999). Miles also tied for first in the 1999 Continental Open in Los Angeles with Alexander Beliavsky, Ľubomír Ftáčnik and Suat Atalık. His last tournament victory was the 2001 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Sackville, New Brunswick.

Miles won the 1990 U.S. Masters Chess Championship.

Miles entered and played at the 2001 British Championship in Scarborough, but withdrew before the final round, apparently because of ill health. His final two games before his death were short draws in the Four Nations Chess League. Miles played in an extraordinary number of chess events during his career, including many arduous weekend tournaments.

The &quot;Miles Variation&quot; (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.Bf4) in the Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence is named after him.

==Death==
Miles died from heart failure on 12 November 2001. His body was found at his home in Harborne, Birmingham, after a friend called on him to take him to a bridge club. He had suffered from diabetes and a post mortem found that this contributed to his death. He was cremated at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Selly Oak on 23 November. There was a moment of silence before the seventh round of the European Team Championships in León, Spain, in his memory.

==Personality==
Miles was often seen as a controversial figure. Once, in the last round of a tournament (Luton, UK, 1975), with Miles needing a draw for first place, and his opponent, Stewart Reuben, wanting a draw for a high placing, he agreed a draw without playing any moves. The arbiter decided to give both players no points for this non-game; the players claimed this &quot;game&quot; had been played often, when players prearranged a draw – this was the only time it had been scored 0–0, rather than playing out some meaningless moves. This sparked lengthy correspondence in British chess journals.

Miles also clashed with chess authorities and with his fellow English players, particularly Keene and Short. Miles made accusations regarding payments that Keene had received from the British Chess Federation for acting as his assistant in the 1985 Interzonal tournament in Tunis. Miles became obsessed with the affair, eventually suffering a mental breakdown over it. He was arrested in September 1987 in Downing Street, apparently under the belief that he had to speak to then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about the matter; he was subsequently hospitalised for two months. Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in November 2003, Short said that &quot;Tony was insanely jealous of my success, and his inability to accept that he was no longer the UK&#x27;s number one was an indication of, if not a trigger for, his descent into madness.&quot;

Miles was also noted for his acerbic wit; according to Genna Sosonko, he was &quot;a master of the laconic barb, the sarcastic remark, and he was never at a loss for words&quot;. He often attacked chess personalities in published articles. He attacked former World Champion Anatoly Karpov in an article entitled &quot;Has Karpov Lost his Marbles?&quot; His review of Eric Schiller&#x27;s book &quot;Unorthodox Chess Openings&quot; (Cardoza Publishing, 1998) which appeared in &quot;Kingpin&quot; consisted of just two words: &quot;Utter crap.&quot;

==Notable games==
*Karpov vs. Miles, Skara 1980. St. George Defence: 0–1. The game between Karpov and Miles with the opening line 1.e4 a6.
*Miles vs. Spassky, 1982. Queen&#x27;s Indian Opening: 1–0. A crushing sacrificial attack against Spassky, then still one of the world&#x27;s strongest players.
*Karpov vs. Miles, Bath 1983, Caro–Kann: 0–1. Another win against Karpovthen world championand again with black. Miles chooses a less popular system in the Caro–Kann and succeeds in creating an unbalanced game where both sides can play for the win.

<text>Vasiliki Papathanasiou (, ; born 23 August 1949), known professionally as Vicky Leandros (, ), is a Greek singer living in Germany. She is the daughter of singer, musician and composer Leandros Papathanasiou (also known as Leo Leandros as well as Mario Panas). In 1967, she achieved worldwide fame after gaining fourth place for the country of Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;L&#x27;amour est bleu&quot;, which became a worldwide hit. She further established her career by winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1972 with the song &quot;Après Toi&quot;, again representing Luxembourg.

On 15 October 2006, Vicky Leandros was elected town councillor of the Greek harbour town of Piraeus on the PASOK list. Her task concerned the cultural and international development of Piraeus. She was also Deputy Mayor of Piraeus. It was announced in June 2008 that Leandros decided to leave her position in Greek politics with immediate effect, stating that she had underestimated the workload and time needed to fulfil her political obligations and that it had become impossible to combine those duties with her singing career.

==Early career==

Leandros was born Vasiliki Papathanasiou in Palaiokastritsa, Corfu. Her father wanted to expand his career and went to West Germany while she grew up at her grandmother&#x27;s house until the age of eight. In 1958, her parents took her to West Germany where she stayed with her father permanently after her parents&#x27; divorce. She revealed her talent at a young age while taking guitar, music, dance, ballet and voice lessons. 

In 1965, she released her first single &quot;Messer, Gabel, Schere, Licht&quot;. This was the beginning of a successful career for her with her father as composer, manager and producer. In 1967, she received an offer to sing for Luxembourg at the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; with the song &quot;L&#x27;amour est bleu&quot;. She finished in fourth place but the song became one of the biggest worldwide hits of the year and was covered by other artists. She was shortly singing in eight languages with her albums, singles and EPs being sold all over the world.

===The 1970s===
In 1970 her first TV show &quot;Ich Bin&quot; was broadcast in 13 European countries. It received many awards for its originality and thought-provoking contemporary graphics including in 1971 the world-famous Bronze Rose of Montreux. It was also the first time that Vicky used the same stage surname as her father (actually his real Christian name) and became known from then onwards as Vicky Leandros having been known simply as Vicky during the 1960s. Guests appearing were Julien Clerc and Deep Purple. The show has been repeated over the years and is seen as a classic piece very evocative of the era though at first it was not well received in all quarters owing to its surprising even shocking imagery in an age when songs were not generally accompanied by visuals for marketing purposes. Throughout the 1970s other film portraits by prominent film makers were to follow which attracted interest around the world. She later went on to host a television series in the UK for the BBC, entitled &quot;Music My Way&quot;.

In 1972 she represented Luxembourg at Eurovision for the second time and won the contest with the song &quot;Après Toi&quot;. Translated into English as &quot;Come What May&quot; it was also a hit in the UK reaching #2 on the UK Singles Chart. The song peaked at number 23 in Australia. Globally it sold over six million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Leandros recorded the song in seven languages. Later in the year she released her version of the Theodorakis composition &quot;O Kaymos (Sorrow, in Greek: Καημός) (The Love in Your Eyes)&quot; which became a hit all over the world in various language versions. It peaked at #40 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1973 &quot;When Bouzoukis Played&quot; became another massive selling world hit in several languages reaching #44 in the UK chart. and 45 in Australia. In 1974 she recorded &quot;Theo, wir fahr&#x27;n nach Lodz&quot; a song that was a #1 hit in Germany. She also found much success in South Africa during the 1970s.

In Japan she reached her peak during the late 1960s and early 1970s and recorded many times in Japanese. Her second Japanese single &quot;Watashi no Sukina Chocolate&quot; (The Chocolate That I Like) became a notable hit. She also recorded many cover versions of songs, &quot;Mamy Blue&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have To Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; among others.

In 1975 she recorded the album entitled &quot;Across the Water&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee, and Miami, Florida. A departure from her previous works by combining country, rock, and soul. The release was well received by critics upon its release in the United States. In 1976 she signed a multimillion-dollar contract with CBS Records for albums to be released in the US market and started working in Hollywood, California with Kim Fowley but soon returned to Europe after CBS&#x27; support faltered.

After returning to Europe Leandros released albums of various genres which included German folk music and Christmas songs. Her career showed signs of fading and she had her last top 20 hit in Germany with the song Kali Nichta. She recorded an album in Spanish-language that gained her attention in Latin America. The first single, &quot;Oh Mi Mama&quot;, was a minor hit, but the second single &quot;Tu Me Has Hecho Sentir” although not promoted by Leandros or CBS due to differences between the two and a reported health scare, was a big hit in Spanish-speaking countries in 1979. It regularly appears on compilation albums and is easily the most famous and remembered song by Vicky Leandros in Spanish. A new album, &quot;Wie am Allerersten Tag&quot; went unreleased and Leandros became pregnant and took time off over the next 18 months.

===The 1980s===

In 1981 she recorded the album &quot;Love is Alive&quot; including duets with Demis Roussos, Johnny Hallyday and US star David Soul for a United Nations Benefit. Also in 1981 she released the album &quot;Ich gehe neue Wege&quot; and its Greek version, &quot;Irtha Yia Sena&quot;. This comeback was consolidated in 1982 by the success of the song &quot;Verlorenes Paradies&quot; from the same titled next album which saw Leandros back in the upper reaches of the singles charts in many territories after a few years absence. It was also recorded in Dutch.

In 1983 came the album &quot;Vicky&quot; containing the popular song and single &quot;Grüße an Sarah&quot; which is regularly still sung in concerts often a cappella with the other musicians and vocalists making the sounds of the beats and instruments vocally to combine with Leandros&#x27; main vocal. Later in 1983 she recorded again in Dutch a song specially for the Dutch-speaking market; &quot;Ver van het leven&quot;. In 1984 the French version - &quot;A l&#x27;Est d&#x27;Eden&quot; - was a big success in France reaching #2 on the singles chart. This single and corresponding album (&quot;Vicky&quot;) gave Leandros a notable comeback in Canada and she toured there after a gap of many years in 1985. Two more single releases from the album also became Canadian hits - &quot;Tu as sept Ponts a traverser&quot; and &quot;Salut bien Sarah&quot; the French version of &quot;Gruesse an Sarah&quot;.

In 1986 following her 1985 album entitled &quot;Eine Nacht in Griechenland&quot; Leandros again took time off to concentrate on her private life. The album achieved Gold status in the Benelux and German speaking countries. It was early 1988 before the next album, &quot;Ich bin ich&quot;, would be released. Working with Klaus &quot;Nick&quot; Munro, the album contained many new rhythms and was more rock- oriented than previous works. Leandros did not tour and made very limited appearances during this period concentrating mainly on her family life and her three young children. Nevertheless, two singles were released from the album &quot;Du hast schon laengst Goodbye gesagt&quot; and &quot;Oh Oh Oh&quot; in a remixed version. In 1989 she returned to her music career in Greece and charted with her comeback album &quot;Piretos tou Erota&quot;. 

===The 1990s===

In 1990 Leandros released the album &quot;Starkes Gefühl&quot; (Strong Feeling) which notably contained a new version of &quot;Apres Toi&quot; her Eurovision song contest winner of 1972. The album also contained the German version of “Piretos tou erota” now &quot;Süchtig nach Geborgenheit&quot; which was the first single cut. The early 1990s saw her scoring successful albums in Greece with &quot;Prosexe&quot; (1991), &quot;Andres&quot; (1993), and in Germany with the singles &quot;Du Bist Mein Schönster Gedanke&quot; (1994), and a duet with Tony Christie, &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Stay Together&quot; (1995).

The resurgence of popularity in Greece saw first the re-release on vinyl of Leandros&#x27; early albums (with different sleeves) and later a CD release of them all with bonus tracks. From 1995 to 1998 she collaborated with German hit-maker Jack White and released three Top-10 albums as well as the German version of the &quot;Titanic&quot; song &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. This song &quot;Weil mein Herz dich nie mehr vergisst&quot; gave Leandros her highest-charting record since Verlorenes Paradies in 1982. 

===The 2000s===

In 2000 Leandros started producing her own records. The album &quot;Jetzt&quot; / &quot;Now&quot; was a success and her own compositions received critical praise. Her duet with Chris De Burgh was one of the highlights of the album. Following this she featured again on the charts of several countries such as Canada, China, Japan, Belgium and South Africa due to the many greatest hits collections that several companies released.

In 2003 she recorded a new album &quot;Tragoudi Alliotiko&quot; with songs by Mikis Theodorakis accompanied by the Kamerata Orchestra under Theodorakis&#x27;s supervision. The album became a success in Germany, central Europe and in Greece. TV stations and tabloid newspaper reviewers celebrated her comeback while other publications and reviewers questioned the rationale behind Leandros&#x27; performance of songs from a political composer like Theodorakis. Around this time she appeared in many TV shows on German and Greek television including galas with José Carreras. The album made it to the 100 best selling records of 2003, and Theodorakis wrote that he considered her &quot;among the two or three most important interpreters of [my] work&quot;.

In 2003, she received two prestigious awards from the Greek government for her promotion of Greek culture and music abroad and another from the Greek Orthodox Church for her work for poor children in Africa. The latter award was presented to her at her classical concert held at the Herod Atticus amphitheatre in October 2003 and is the highest honour that the Greek Orthodox church can bestow. Leandros is the only woman to date to be awarded such an honor. 2005 saw the release of a double album &quot;Ich Bin Wie Ich Bin&quot; containing new recordings of her songs. The album charted in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Her Jubilee Tour of Europe started in February 2006. A month later she took part in the German pre-selection for the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; 34 years since &quot;Après Toi&quot;. Her song &quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart&quot; which had already entered the charts failed to win the most votes from the televoting public.

Leandros released a CD in March 2009 titled &quot;Möge der Himmel&quot;. This album contained soul elements combined with some R&amp;B flavour, hip hop and rap. The change in direction was headline news and the album received mixed reviews.

===Recent career===

The next album &quot;Zeitlos&quot; in 2010 returned to the idea born in 2008 of recording a collection of French songs and World hits in the German language. In 2011, she re-recorded her hit &quot;L&#x27;amour est bleu&quot; as &quot;C&#x27;est Bleu&quot; for the Scooter album &quot;The Big Mash Up&quot;. The unusual collaboration was named a highlight of the record and was released as a single on 2 December 2011. A new studio album with the title “Ich weiss, dass ich nichts weiss” was released on the Ariola (Sony) label in 2015 . The majority of the tracks contained were co-composed (music and lyrics) by Leandros. The themes of the songs are based to some extent on personal life experiences of the singer. Leandros is retiring from the road in 2024 and is currently on her sold out farewell tour.

==Personal life==

From 1982 to 1986, Leandros was married to Greek entrepreneur Ivan Zissiadis, the father of her son, Leandros Zissiadis (born 6 June 1980). She married Enno von Ruffin, son of Freiherr Franz von Ruffin in May 1986. Enno von Ruffin has owned and managed his country estate, Gut Basthorst, since 1982. In 2005, Leandros and Enno separated after 19 years of marriage.

<text>Clinical trials are prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments (such as novel vaccines, drugs, dietary choices, dietary supplements, and medical devices) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on dosage, safety and efficacy. They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial—their approval does not mean the therapy is &#x27;safe&#x27; or effective, only that the trial may be conducted.

Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers, in one country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results.

Costs for clinical trials can range into the billions of dollars per approved drug, and the complete trial process to approval may require 7–15 years. The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical-device company. Certain functions necessary to the trial, such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an outsourced partner, such as a contract research organization or a central laboratory. Only 10 percent of all drugs started in human clinical trials become approved drugs.
==Overview==
===Trials of drugs===

Some clinical trials involve healthy subjects with no pre-existing medical conditions. Other clinical trials pertain to people with specific health conditions who are willing to try an experimental treatment. Pilot experiments are conducted to gain insights for design of the clinical trial to follow.

There are two goals to testing medical treatments: to learn whether they work well enough, called &quot;efficacy&quot;, or &quot;effectiveness&quot;; and to learn whether they are safe enough, called &quot;safety&quot;. Neither is an absolute criterion; both safety and efficacy are evaluated relative to how the treatment is intended to be used, what other treatments are available, and the severity of the disease or condition. The benefits must outweigh the risks. For example, many drugs to treat cancer have severe side effects that would not be acceptable for an over-the-counter pain medication, yet the cancer drugs have been approved since they are used under a physician&#x27;s care and are used for a life-threatening condition.

In the US the elderly constitute 14% of the population, while they consume over one-third of drugs. People over 55 (or a similar cutoff age) are often excluded from trials because their greater health issues and drug use complicate data interpretation, and because they have different physiological capacity than younger people. Children and people with unrelated medical conditions are also frequently excluded. Pregnant women are often excluded due to potential risks to the fetus.

The sponsor designs the trial in coordination with a panel of expert clinical investigators, including what alternative or existing treatments to compare to the new drug and what type(s) of patients might benefit. If the sponsor cannot obtain enough test subjects at one location investigators at other locations are recruited to join the study.

During the trial, investigators recruit subjects with the predetermined characteristics, administer the treatment(s) and collect data on the subjects&#x27; health for a defined time period. Data include measurements such as vital signs, concentration of the study drug in the blood or tissues, changes to symptoms, and whether improvement or worsening of the condition targeted by the study drug occurs. The researchers send the data to the trial sponsor, who then analyzes the pooled data using statistical tests.

Examples of clinical trial goals include assessing the safety and relative effectiveness of a medication or device:
* On a specific kind of patient
* At varying dosages
* For a new indication
* Evaluation for improved efficacy in treating a condition as compared to the standard therapy for that condition
* Evaluation of the study drug or device relative to two or more already approved/common interventions for that condition

While most clinical trials test one alternative to the novel intervention, some expand to three or four and may include a placebo.

Except for small, single-location trials, the design and objectives are specified in a document called a clinical trial protocol. The protocol is the trial&#x27;s &quot;operating manual&quot; and ensures all researchers perform the trial in the same way on similar subjects and that the data is comparable across all subjects.

As a trial is designed to test hypotheses and rigorously monitor and assess outcomes, it can be seen as an application of the scientific method, specifically the experimental step.

The most common clinical trials evaluate new pharmaceutical products, medical devices, biologics, diagnostic assays, psychological therapies, or other interventions. Clinical trials may be required before a national regulatory authority approves marketing of the innovation.

===Trials of devices===

Similarly to drugs, manufacturers of medical devices in the United States are required to conduct clinical trials for premarket approval. Device trials may compare a new device to an established therapy, or may compare similar devices to each other. An example of the former in the field of vascular surgery is the Open versus Endovascular Repair (OVER trial) for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm, which compared the older open aortic repair technique to the newer endovascular aneurysm repair device. An example of the latter are clinical trials on mechanical devices used in the management of adult female urinary incontinence.

===Trials of procedures===

Similarly to drugs, medical or surgical procedures may be subjected to clinical trials, such as comparing different surgical approaches in treatment of fibroids for subfertility. However, when clinical trials are unethical or logistically impossible in the surgical setting, case-controlled studies will be replaced.

=== Patient and public involvement ===
Besides being participants in a clinical trial, members of the public can be actively collaborate with researchers in designing and conducting clinical research. This is known as patient and public involvement (PPI). Public involvement involves a working partnership between patients, caregivers, people with lived experience, and researchers to shape and influence what is researcher and how. PPI can improve the quality of research and make it more relevant and accessible. People with current or past experience of illness can provide a different perspective than professionals and compliment their knowledge. Through their personal knowledge they can identify research topics that are relevant and important to those living with an illness or using a service. They can also help to make the research more grounded in the needs of the specific communities they are part of. Public contributors can also ensure that the research is presented in plain language that is clear to the wider society and the specific groups it is most relevant for.

==History==
===Development===
Although early medical experimentation was performed often, the use of a control group to provide an accurate comparison for the demonstration of the intervention&#x27;s efficacy was generally lacking. For instance, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who campaigned for the introduction of inoculation (then called variolation) to prevent smallpox, arranged for seven prisoners who had been sentenced to death to undergo variolation in exchange for their life. Although they survived and did not contract smallpox, there was no control group to assess whether this result was due to the inoculation or some other factor. Similar experiments performed by Edward Jenner over his smallpox vaccine were equally conceptually flawed.

The first proper clinical trial was conducted by the Scottish physician James Lind. The disease scurvy, now known to be caused by a Vitamin C deficiency, would often have terrible effects on the welfare of the crew of long-distance ocean voyages. In 1740, the catastrophic result of Anson&#x27;s circumnavigation attracted much attention in Europe; out of 1900 men, 1400 had died, most of them allegedly from having contracted scurvy. John Woodall, an English military surgeon of the British East India Company, had recommended the consumption of citrus fruit from the 17th century, but their use did not become widespread.

Lind conducted the first systematic clinical trial in 1747. He included a dietary supplement of an acidic quality in the experiment after two months at sea, when the ship was already afflicted with scurvy. He divided twelve scorbutic sailors into six groups of two. They all received the same diet but, in addition, group one was given a quart of cider daily, group two twenty-five drops of elixir of vitriol (sulfuric acid), group three six spoonfuls of vinegar, group four half a pint of seawater, group five received two oranges and one lemon, and the last group a spicy paste plus a drink of barley water. The treatment of group five stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by then one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one also showed some effect of its treatment. Each year, May 20 is celebrated as Clinical Trials Day in honor of Lind&#x27;s research.

After 1750 the discipline began to take its modern shape. The English doctor John Haygarth demonstrated the importance of a control group for the correct identification of the placebo effect in his celebrated study of the ineffective remedy called &quot;Perkin&#x27;s tractors&quot;. Further work in that direction was carried out by the eminent physician Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet in the 1860s.

Frederick Akbar Mahomed (d. 1884), who worked at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London, made substantial contributions to the process of clinical trials, where &quot;he separated chronic nephritis with secondary hypertension from what we now term essential hypertension. He also founded the Collective Investigation Record for the British Medical Association; this organization collected data from physicians practicing outside the hospital setting and was the precursor of modern collaborative clinical trials.&quot;

===Modern trials===
Ideas of Sir Ronald A. Fisher still play a role in clinical trials. While working for the Rothamsted experimental station in the field of agriculture, Fisher developed his &quot;Principles of experimental design&quot; in the 1920s as an accurate methodology for the proper design of experiments. Among his major ideas include the importance of randomizationthe random assignment of individual elements (eg crops or patients) to different groups for the experiment; replicationto reduce uncertainty, measurements should be repeated and experiments replicated to identify sources of variation; blocking—to arrange experimental units into groups of units that are similar to each other, and thus reducing irrelevant sources of variation; use of factorial experiments—efficient at evaluating the effects and possible interactions of several independent factors. Of these, blocking and factorial design are seldom applied in clinical trials, because the experimental units are human subjects and there is typically only one independent intervention: the treatment.

The British Medical Research Council officially recognized the importance of clinical trials from the 1930s. The council established the &quot;Therapeutic Trials Committee&quot; to advise and assist in the arrangement of properly controlled clinical trials on new products that seem likely on experimental grounds to have value in the treatment of disease.

The first randomised curative trial was carried out at the MRC Tuberculosis Research Unit by Sir Geoffrey Marshall (1887–1982). The trial, carried out between 1946 and 1947, aimed to test the efficacy of the chemical streptomycin for curing pulmonary tuberculosis. The trial was both double-blind and placebo-controlled.

The methodology of clinical trials was further developed by Sir Austin Bradford Hill, who had been involved in the streptomycin trials. From the 1920s, Hill applied statistics to medicine, attending the lectures of renowned mathematician Karl Pearson, among others. He became famous for a landmark study carried out in collaboration with Richard Doll on the correlation between smoking and lung cancer. They carried out a case-control study in 1950, which compared lung cancer patients with matched control and also began a sustained long-term prospective study into the broader issue of smoking and health, which involved studying the smoking habits and health of more than 30,000 doctors over a period of several years. His certificate for election to the Royal Society called him &quot;...the leader in the development in medicine of the precise experimental methods now used nationally and internationally in the evaluation of new therapeutic and prophylactic agents.&quot;

International clinical trials day is celebrated on 20 May.

The acronyms used in the titling of clinical trials are often contrived, and have been the subject of derision.

==Types==

Clinical trials are classified by the research objective created by the investigators.
* In an observational study, the investigators observe the subjects and measure their outcomes. The researchers do not actively manage the study.
* In an &quot;interventional study&quot;, the investigators give the research subjects an experimental drug, surgical procedure, use of a medical device, diagnostic or other intervention to compare the treated subjects with those receiving no treatment or the standard treatment. Then the researchers assess how the subjects&#x27; health changes.

Trials are classified by their purpose. After approval for human research is granted to the trial sponsor, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) organizes and monitors the results of trials according to type:
* &quot;Prevention&quot; trials look for ways to prevent disease in people who have never had the disease or to prevent a disease from returning. These approaches may include drugs, vitamins or other micronutrients, vaccines, or lifestyle changes.
* &quot;Screening&quot; trials test for ways to identify certain diseases or health conditions.
* &quot;Diagnostic&quot; trials are conducted to find better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition.
* &quot;Treatment&quot; trials test experimental drugs, new combinations of drugs, or new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy.
* &quot;Quality of life&quot; trials (supportive care trials) evaluate how to improve comfort and quality of care for people with a chronic illness.
* &quot;Genetic&quot; trials are conducted to assess the prediction accuracy of genetic disorders making a person more or less likely to develop a disease.
* &quot;Epidemiological&quot; trials have the goal of identifying the general causes, patterns or control of diseases in large numbers of people.
* &quot;Compassionate use&quot; trials or expanded access trials provide partially tested, unapproved therapeutics to a small number of patients who have no other realistic options. Usually, this involves a disease for which no effective therapy has been approved, or a patient who has already failed all standard treatments and whose health is too compromised to qualify for participation in randomized clinical trials. Usually, case-by-case approval must be granted by both the FDA and the pharmaceutical company for such exceptions.
* Fixed trials consider existing data only during the trial&#x27;s design, do not modify the trial after it begins, and do not assess the results until the study is completed.
* Adaptive clinical trials use existing data to design the trial, and then use interim results to modify the trial as it proceeds. Modifications include dosage, sample size, drug undergoing trial, patient selection criteria and &quot;cocktail&quot; mix. Adaptive trials often employ a Bayesian experimental design to assess the trial&#x27;s progress. In some cases, trials have become an ongoing process that regularly adds and drops therapies and patient groups as more information is gained. The aim is to more quickly identify drugs that have a therapeutic effect and to zero in on patient populations for whom the drug is appropriate.

Clinical trials are conducted typically in four phases, with each phase using different numbers of subjects and having a different purpose to construct focus on identifying a specific effect.

===Phases===

Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into five phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial. The drug development process will normally proceed through phases I–IV over many years, frequently involving a decade or longer. If the drug successfully passes through phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV trials are performed after the newly approved drug, diagnostic or device is marketed, providing assessment about risks, benefits, or best uses.

==Trial design==

A fundamental distinction in evidence-based practice is between observational studies and randomized controlled trials. Types of observational studies in epidemiology, such as the cohort study and the case-control study, provide less compelling evidence than the randomized controlled trial. In observational studies, the investigators retrospectively assess associations between the treatments given to participants and their health status, with potential for considerable errors in design and interpretation.

A randomized controlled trial can provide compelling evidence that the study treatment causes an effect on human health.

Some Phase II and most Phase III drug trials are designed as randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.
* Randomized: Each study subject is randomly assigned to receive either the study treatment or a placebo.
* Blind: The subjects involved in the study do not know which study treatment they receive. If the study is double-blind, the researchers also do not know which treatment a subject receives. This intent is to prevent researchers from treating the two groups differently. A form of double-blind study called a &quot;double-dummy&quot; design allows additional insurance against bias. In this kind of study, all patients are given both placebo and active doses in alternating periods.
* Placebo-controlled: The use of a placebo (fake treatment) allows the researchers to isolate the effect of the study treatment from the placebo effect.

Clinical studies having small numbers of subjects may be &quot;sponsored&quot; by single researchers or a small group of researchers, and are designed to test simple questions or feasibility to expand the research for a more comprehensive randomized controlled trial.

Clinical studies can be &quot;sponsored&quot; (financed and organized) by academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, government entities and even private groups. Trials are conducted for new drugs, biotechnology, diagnostic assays or medical devices to determine their safety and efficacy prior to being submitted for regulatory review that would determine market approval.

===Active control studies===

In cases where giving a placebo to a person suffering from a disease may be unethical, &quot;active comparator&quot; (also known as &quot;active control&quot;) trials may be conducted instead. In trials with an active control group, subjects are given either the experimental treatment or a previously approved treatment with known effectiveness. In other cases, sponsors may conduct an active comparator trial to establish an efficacy claim relative to the active comparator instead of the placebo in labeling.

===Master protocol===
A master protocol includes multiple substudies, which may have different objectives and involve coordinated efforts to evaluate one or more medical products in one or more diseases or conditions within the overall study structure. Trials that could develop a master protocol include the umbrella trial (multiple medical products for a single disease), platform trial (multiple products for a single disease entering and leaving the platform), and basket trial (one medical product for multiple diseases or disease subtypes).

Genetic testing enables researchers to group patients according to their genetic profile, deliver drugs based on that profile to that group and compare the results. Multiple companies can participate, each bringing a different drug. The first such approach targets squamous cell cancer, which includes varying genetic disruptions from patient to patient. Amgen, AstraZeneca and Pfizer are involved, the first time they have worked together in a late-stage trial. Patients whose genomic profiles do not match any of the trial drugs receive a drug designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer.

A clinical trial protocol is a document used to define and manage the trial. It is prepared by a panel of experts. All study investigators are expected to strictly observe the protocol.

The protocol describes the scientific rationale, objective(s), design, methodology, statistical considerations and organization of the planned trial. Details of the trial are provided in documents referenced in the protocol, such as an investigator&#x27;s brochure.

The protocol contains a precise study plan to assure safety and health of the trial subjects and to provide an exact template for trial conduct by investigators. This allows data to be combined across all investigators/sites. The protocol also informs the study administrators (often a contract research organization).

The format and content of clinical trial protocols sponsored by pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies in the United States, European Union, or Japan have been standardized to follow Good Clinical Practice guidance issued by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). Regulatory authorities in Canada, China, South Korea, and the UK also follow ICH guidelines. Journals such as &quot;Trials&quot;, encourage investigators to publish their protocols.

===Design features===
====Informed consent====
Clinical trials recruit study subjects to sign a document representing their &quot;informed consent&quot;. The document includes details such as its purpose, duration, required procedures, risks, potential benefits, key contacts and institutional requirements. The participant then decides whether to sign the document. The document is not a contract, as the participant can withdraw at any time without penalty.

Informed consent is a legal process in which a recruit is instructed about key facts before deciding whether to participate. Researchers explain the details of the study in terms the subject can understand. The information is presented in the subject&#x27;s native language. Generally, children cannot autonomously provide informed consent, but depending on their age and other factors, may be required to provide informed assent.

====Statistical power====
In any clinical trial, the number of subjects, also called the sample size, has a large impact on the ability to reliably detect and measure the effects of the intervention. This ability is described as its &quot;power&quot;, which must be calculated before initiating a study to figure out if the study is worth its costs. In general, a larger sample size increases the statistical power, also the cost.

The statistical power estimates the ability of a trial to detect a difference of a particular size (or larger) between the treatment and control groups. For example, a trial of a lipid-lowering drug versus placebo with 100 patients in each group might have a power of 0.90 to detect a difference between placebo and trial groups receiving dosage of 10 mg/dL or more, but only 0.70 to detect a difference of 6 mg/dL.

===Placebo groups===
Merely giving a treatment can have nonspecific effects. These are controlled for by the inclusion of patients who receive only a placebo. Subjects are assigned randomly without informing them to which group they belonged. Many trials are doubled-blinded so that researchers do not know to which group a subject is assigned.

Assigning a subject to a placebo group can pose an ethical problem if it violates his or her right to receive the best available treatment. The Declaration of Helsinki provides guidelines on this issue.

===Duration===
Clinical trials are only a small part of the research that goes into developing a new treatment. Potential drugs, for example, first have to be discovered, purified, characterized, and tested in labs (in cell and animal studies) before ever undergoing clinical trials. In all, about 1,000 potential drugs are tested before just one reaches the point of being tested in a clinical trial. For example, a new cancer drug has, on average, six years of research behind it before it even makes it to clinical trials. But the major holdup in making new cancer drugs available is the time it takes to complete clinical trials themselves. On average, about eight years pass from the time a cancer drug enters clinical trials until it receives approval from regulatory agencies for sale to the public. Drugs for other diseases have similar timelines.

Some reasons a clinical trial might last several years:
* For chronic conditions such as cancer, it takes months, if not years, to see if a cancer treatment has an effect on a patient.
* For drugs that are not expected to have a strong effect (meaning a large number of patients must be recruited to observe &#x27;any&#x27; effect), recruiting enough patients to test the drug&#x27;s effectiveness (i.e., getting statistical power) can take several years.
* Only certain people who have the target disease condition are eligible to take part in each clinical trial. Researchers who treat these particular patients must participate in the trial. Then they must identify the desirable patients and obtain consent from them or their families to take part in the trial.

A clinical trial might also include an extended post-study follow-up period from months to years for people who have participated in the trial, a so-called &quot;extension phase&quot;, which aims to identify long-term impact of the treatment.

The biggest barrier to completing studies is the shortage of people who take part. All drug and many device trials target a subset of the population, meaning not everyone can participate. Some drug trials require patients to have unusual combinations of disease characteristics. It is a challenge to find the appropriate patients and obtain their consent, especially when they may receive no direct benefit (because they are not paid, the study drug is not yet proven to work, or the patient may receive a placebo). In the case of cancer patients, fewer than 5% of adults with cancer will participate in drug trials. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), about 400 cancer medicines were being tested in clinical trials in 2005. Not all of these will prove to be useful, but those that are may be delayed in getting approved because the number of participants is so low.

For clinical trials involving potential for seasonal influences (such as airborne allergies, seasonal affective disorder, influenza, and skin diseases), the study may be done during a limited part of the year (such as spring for pollen allergies), when the drug can be tested.

Clinical trials that do not involve a new drug usually have a much shorter duration. (Exceptions are epidemiological studies, such as the Nurses&#x27; Health Study).

==Administration==

Clinical trials designed by a local investigator, and (in the US) federally funded clinical trials, are almost always administered by the researcher who designed the study and applied for the grant. Small-scale device studies may be administered by the sponsoring company. Clinical trials of new drugs are usually administered by a contract research organization (CRO) hired by the sponsoring company. The sponsor provides the drug and medical oversight. A CRO is contracted to perform all the administrative work on a clinical trial. For PhasesII–IV the CRO recruits participating researchers, trains them, provides them with supplies, coordinates study administration and data collection, sets up meetings, monitors the sites for compliance with the clinical protocol, and ensures the sponsor receives data from every site. Specialist site management organizations can also be hired to coordinate with the CRO to ensure rapid IRB/IEC approval and faster site initiation and patient recruitment. PhaseI clinical trials of new medicines are often conducted in a specialist clinical trial clinic, with dedicated pharmacologists, where the subjects can be observed by full-time staff. These clinics are often run by a CRO which specialises in these studies.

At a participating site, one or more research assistants (often nurses) do most of the work in conducting the clinical trial. The research assistant&#x27;s job can include some or all of the following: providing the local institutional review board (IRB) with the documentation necessary to obtain its permission to conduct the study, assisting with study start-up, identifying eligible patients, obtaining consent from them or their families, administering study treatment(s), collecting and statistically analyzing data, maintaining and updating data files during followup, and communicating with the IRB, as well as the sponsor and CRO.

===Quality===

In the context of a clinical trial, quality typically refers to the absence of errors which can impact decision making, both during the conduct of the trial and in use of the trial results.

===Marketing===

An Interactional Justice Model may be used to test the effects of willingness to talk with a doctor about clinical trial enrollment. Results found that potential clinical trial candidates were less likely to enroll in clinical trials if the patient is more willing to talk with their doctor. The reasoning behind this discovery may be patients are happy with their current care. Another reason for the negative relationship between perceived fairness and clinical trial enrollment is the lack of independence from the care provider. Results found that there is a positive relationship between a lack of willingness to talk with their doctor and clinical trial enrollment. Lack of willingness to talk about clinical trials with current care providers may be due to patients&#x27; independence from the doctor. Patients who are less likely to talk about clinical trials are more willing to use other sources of information to gain a better insight of alternative treatments. Clinical trial enrollment should be motivated to utilize websites and television advertising to inform the public about clinical trial enrollment.

===Information technology===

The last decade has seen a proliferation of information technology use in the planning and conduct of clinical trials. Clinical trial management systems are often used by research sponsors or CROs to help plan and manage the operational aspects of a clinical trial, particularly with respect to investigational sites. Advanced analytics for identifying researchers and research sites with expertise in a given area utilize public and private information about ongoing research. Web-based electronic data capture (EDC) and clinical data management systems are used in a majority of clinical trials to collect case report data from sites, manage its quality and prepare it for analysis. Interactive voice response systems are used by sites to register the enrollment of patients using a phone and to allocate patients to a particular treatment arm (although phones are being increasingly replaced with web-based (IWRS) tools which are sometimes part of the EDC system). While patient-reported outcome were often paper based in the past, measurements are increasingly being collected using web portals or hand-held ePRO (or ) devices, sometimes wireless. Statistical software is used to analyze the collected data and prepare them for regulatory submission. Access to many of these applications are increasingly aggregated in web-based clinical trial portals. In 2011, the FDA approved a PhaseI trial that used telemonitoring, also known as remote patient monitoring, to collect biometric data in patients&#x27; homes and transmit it electronically to the trial database. This technology provides many more data points and is far more convenient for patients, because they have fewer visits to trial sites. As noted below, decentralized clinical trials are those that do not require patients&#x27; physical presence at a site, and instead rely largely on digital health data collection, digital informed consent processes, and so on.

==Analysis==
A clinical trial produces data that could reveal quantitative differences between two or more interventions; statistical analyses are used to determine whether such differences are true, result from chance, or are the same as no treatment (placebo). Data from a clinical trial accumulate gradually over the trial duration, extending from months to years. Accordingly, results for participants recruited early in the study become available for analysis while subjects are still being assigned to treatment groups in the trial. Early analysis may allow the emerging evidence to assist decisions about whether to stop the study, or to reassign participants to the more successful segment of the trial. Investigators may also want to stop a trial when data analysis shows no treatment effect.

==Ethical aspects==
Clinical trials are closely supervised by appropriate regulatory authorities. All studies involving a medical or therapeutic intervention on patients must be approved by a supervising ethics committee before permission is granted to run the trial. The local ethics committee has discretion on how it will supervise noninterventional studies (observational studies or those using already collected data). In the US, this body is called the Institutional Review Board (IRB); in the EU, they are called Ethics committees. Most IRBs are located at the local investigator&#x27;s hospital or institution, but some sponsors allow the use of a central (independent/for profit) IRB for investigators who work at smaller institutions.

To be ethical, researchers must obtain the full and informed consent of participating human subjects. (One of the IRB&#x27;s main functions is to ensure potential patients are adequately informed about the clinical trial.) If the patient is unable to consent for him/herself, researchers can seek consent from the patient&#x27;s legally authorized representative. In addition, the clinical trial participants must be made aware that they can withdraw from the clinical trial at any time without any adverse action taken against them. In California, the state has prioritized the individuals who can serve as the legally authorized representative.

In some US locations, the local IRB must certify researchers and their staff before they can conduct clinical trials. They must understand the federal patient privacy (HIPAA) law and good clinical practice. The International Conference of Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice is a set of standards used internationally for the conduct of clinical trials. The guidelines aim to ensure the &quot;rights, safety and well being of trial subjects are protected&quot;.

The notion of informed consent of participating human subjects exists in many countries but its precise definition may still vary.

Informed consent is clearly a &#x27;necessary&#x27; condition for ethical conduct but does not &#x27;ensure&#x27; ethical conduct. In compassionate use trials the latter becomes a particularly difficult problem. The final objective is to serve the community of patients or future patients in a best-possible and most responsible way. See also Expanded access. However, it may be hard to turn this objective into a well-defined, quantified, objective function. In some cases this can be done, however, for instance, for questions of when to stop sequential treatments (see Odds algorithm), and then quantified methods may play an important role.

Additional ethical concerns are present when conducting clinical trials on children (pediatrics), and in emergency or epidemic situations.

Ethically balancing the rights of multiple stakeholders may be difficult. For example, when drug trials fail, the sponsors may have a duty to tell current and potential investors immediately, which means both the research staff and the enrolled participants may first hear about the end of a trial through public business news.

===Conflicts of interest and unfavorable studies===

In response to specific cases in which unfavorable data from pharmaceutical company-sponsored research were not published, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America published new guidelines urging companies to report all findings and limit the financial involvement in drug companies by researchers. The US Congress signed into law a bill which requires PhaseII and PhaseIII clinical trials to be registered by the sponsor on the clinicaltrials.gov website compiled by the National Institutes of Health.

Drug researchers not directly employed by pharmaceutical companies often seek grants from manufacturers, and manufacturers often look to academic researchers to conduct studies within networks of universities and their hospitals, e.g., for translational cancer research. Similarly, competition for tenured academic positions, government grants and prestige create conflicts of interest among academic scientists. According to one study, approximately 75% of articles retracted for misconduct-related reasons have no declared industry financial support. Seeding trials are particularly controversial.

In the United States, all clinical trials submitted to the FDA as part of a drug approval process are independently assessed by clinical experts within the Food and Drug Administration, including inspections of primary data collection at selected clinical trial sites.

In 2001, the editors of 12 major journals issued a joint editorial, published in each journal, on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors, particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication. They strengthened editorial restrictions to counter the effect. The editorial noted that contract research organizations had, by 2000, received 60% of the grants from pharmaceutical companies in the US. Researchers may be restricted from contributing to the trial design, accessing the raw data, and interpreting the results.

Despite explicit recommendations  by stakeholders of measures to improve the standards of industry-sponsored medical research,   in 2013, Tohen warned of the persistence of a gap in the credibility of conclusions arising from industry-funded clinical trials, and called for ensuring strict adherence to ethical standards in industrial collaborations with academia, in order to avoid further erosion of the public&#x27;s trust. Issues referred for attention in this respect include potential observation bias, duration of the observation time for maintenance studies, the selection of the patient populations, factors that affect placebo response, and funding sources.

===During public health crisis===
Conducting clinical trials of vaccines during epidemics and pandemics is subject to ethical concerns. For diseases with high mortality rates like Ebola, assigning individuals to a placebo or control group can be viewed as a death sentence. In response to ethical concerns regarding clinical research during epidemics, the National Academy of Medicine authored a report identifying seven ethical and scientific considerations. These considerations are:

* Scientific value
* Social value
* Respect for persons
* Community engagement
* Concern for participant welfare and interests
* A balance towards benefit over risks
* Post-trial access to tested therapies that had been withheld during the trial
===Pregnant women and children===

Pregnant women and children are typically excluded from clinical trials as vulnerable populations, though the data to support excluding them is not robust. By excluding them from clinical trials, information about the safety and effectiveness of therapies for these populations is often lacking. During the early history of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, a scientist noted that by excluding these groups from potentially life-saving treatment, they were being &quot;protected to death&quot;. Projects such as Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies (PREVENT) have advocated for the ethical inclusion of pregnant women in vaccine trials. Inclusion of children in clinical trials has additional moral considerations, as children lack decision-making autonomy. Trials in the past had been criticized for using hospitalized children or orphans; these ethical concerns effectively stopped future research. In efforts to maintain effective pediatric care, several European countries and the US have policies to entice or compel pharmaceutical companies to conduct pediatric trials. International guidance recommends ethical pediatric trials by limiting harm, considering varied risks, and taking into account the complexities of pediatric care.

==Safety==

Responsibility for the safety of the subjects in a clinical trial is shared between the sponsor, the local site investigators (if different from the sponsor), the various IRBs that supervise the study, and (in some cases, if the study involves a marketable drug or device), the regulatory agency for the country where the drug or device will be sold.

A systematic concurrent safety review is frequently employed to assure research participant safety. The conduct and on-going review is designed to be proportional to the risk of the trial. Typically this role is filled by a Data and Safety Committee, an externally appointed Medical Safety Monitor, an Independent Safety Officer, or for small or low-risk studies the principal investigator.

For safety reasons, many clinical trials of drugs are designed to exclude women of childbearing age, pregnant women, or women who become pregnant during the study. In some cases, the male partners of these women are also excluded or required to take birth control measures.

===Sponsor===

Throughout the clinical trial, the sponsor is responsible for accurately informing the local site investigators of the true historical safety record of the drug, device or other medical treatments to be tested, and of any potential interactions of the study treatment(s) with already approved treatments. This allows the local investigators to make an informed judgment on whether to participate in the study or not. The sponsor is also responsible for monitoring the results of the study as they come in from the various sites as the trial proceeds. In larger clinical trials, a sponsor will use the services of a data monitoring committee (DMC, known in the US as a data safety monitoring board). This independent group of clinicians and statisticians meets periodically to review the unblinded data the sponsor has received so far. The DMC has the power to recommend termination of the study based on their review, for example if the study treatment is causing more deaths than the standard treatment, or seems to be causing unexpected and study-related serious adverse events. The sponsor is responsible for collecting adverse event reports from all site investigators in the study, and for informing all the investigators of the sponsor&#x27;s judgment as to whether these adverse events were related or not related to the study treatment.

The sponsor and the local site investigators are jointly responsible for writing a site-specific informed consent that accurately informs the potential subjects of the true risks and potential benefits of participating in the study, while at the same time presenting the material as briefly as possible and in ordinary language. FDA regulations state that participating in clinical trials is voluntary, with the subject having the right not to participate or to end participation at any time.

===Local site investigators===

The ethical principle of &quot;primum non-nocere&quot; (&quot;first, do no harm&quot;) guides the trial, and if an investigator believes the study treatment may be harming subjects in the study, the investigator can stop participating at any time. On the other hand, investigators often have a financial interest in recruiting subjects, and could act unethically to obtain and maintain their participation.

The local investigators are responsible for conducting the study according to the study protocol, and supervising the study staff throughout the duration of the study. The local investigator or his/her study staff are also responsible for ensuring the potential subjects in the study understand the risks and potential benefits of participating in the study. In other words, they (or their legally authorized representatives) must give truly informed consent.

Local investigators are responsible for reviewing all adverse event reports sent by the sponsor. These adverse event reports contain the opinions of both the investigator (at the site where the adverse event occurred) and the sponsor, regarding the relationship of the adverse event to the study treatments. Local investigators also are responsible for making an independent judgment of these reports, and promptly informing the local IRB of all serious and study treatment-related adverse events.

When a local investigator is the sponsor, there may not be formal adverse event reports, but study staff at all locations are responsible for informing the coordinating investigator of anything unexpected. The local investigator is responsible for being truthful to the local IRB in all communications relating to the study.

===Institutional review boards (IRBs)===

Approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), is necessary before all but the most informal research can begin. In commercial clinical trials, the study protocol is not approved by an IRB before the sponsor recruits sites to conduct the trial. However, the study protocol and procedures have been tailored to fit generic IRB submission requirements. In this case, and where there is no independent sponsor, each local site investigator submits the study protocol, the consent(s), the data collection forms, and supporting documentation to the local IRB. Universities and most hospitals have in-house IRBs. Other researchers (such as in walk-in clinics) use independent IRBs.

The IRB scrutinizes the study both for medical safety and for protection of the patients involved in the study, before it allows the researcher to begin the study. It may require changes in study procedures or in the explanations given to the patient. A required yearly &quot;continuing review&quot; report from the investigator updates the IRB on the progress of the study and any new safety information related to the study.

===Regulatory agencies===

In the US, the FDA can audit the files of local site investigators after they have finished participating in a study, to see if they were correctly following study procedures. This audit may be random, or for cause (because the investigator is suspected of fraudulent data). Avoiding an audit is an incentive for investigators to follow study procedures. A &#x27;covered clinical study&#x27; refers to a trial submitted to the FDA as part of a marketing application (for example, as part of an NDA or 510(k)), about which the FDA may require disclosure of financial interest of the clinical investigator in the outcome of the study. For example, the applicant must disclose whether an investigator owns equity in the sponsor, or owns proprietary interest in the product under investigation. The FDA defines a covered study as &quot;...any study of a drug, biological product or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or any study in which a single investigator makes a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.&quot;

Alternatively, many American pharmaceutical companies have moved some clinical trials overseas. Benefits of conducting trials abroad include lower costs (in some countries) and the ability to run larger trials in shorter timeframes, whereas a potential disadvantage exists in lower-quality trial management. Different countries have different regulatory requirements and enforcement abilities. An estimated 40% of all clinical trials now take place in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central and South America. &quot;There is no compulsory registration system for clinical trials in these countries and many do not follow European directives in their operations&quot;, says Jacob Sijtsma of the Netherlands-based WEMOS, an advocacy health organisation tracking clinical trials in developing countries.

Beginning in the 1980s, harmonization of clinical trial protocols was shown as feasible across countries of the European Union. At the same time, coordination between Europe, Japan and the United States led to a joint regulatory-industry initiative on international harmonization named after 1990 as the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)
Currently, most clinical trial programs follow ICH guidelines, aimed at &quot;ensuring that good quality, safe and effective medicines are developed and registered in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. These activities are pursued in the interest of the consumer and public health, to prevent unnecessary duplication of clinical trials in humans and to minimize the use of animal testing without compromising the regulatory obligations of safety and effectiveness.&quot;

===Aggregation of safety data during clinical development===

Aggregating safety data across clinical trials during drug development is important because trials are generally designed to focus on determining how well the drug works. The safety data collected and aggregated across multiple trials as the drug is developed allows the sponsor, investigators and regulatory agencies to monitor the aggregate safety profile of experimental medicines as they are developed. The value of assessing aggregate safety data is: a) decisions based on aggregate safety assessment during development of the medicine can be made throughout the medicine&#x27;s development and b) it sets up the sponsor and regulators well for assessing the medicine&#x27;s safety after the drug is approved.

==Economics==

Clinical trial costs vary depending on trial phase, type of trial, and disease studied. A study of clinical trials conducted in the United States from 2004 to 2012 found the average cost of PhaseI trials to be between $1.4 million and $6.6 million, depending on the type of disease. Phase II trials ranged from $7 million to $20 million, and PhaseIII trials from $11 million to $53 million.

===Sponsor===

The cost of a study depends on many factors, especially the number of sites conducting the study, the number of patients involved, and whether the study treatment is already approved for medical use.

The expenses incurred by a pharmaceutical company in administering a Phase III orIV clinical trial may include, among others:
* production of the drug(s) or device(s) being evaluated
* staff salaries for the designers and administrators of the trial
* payments to the contract research organization, the site management organization (if used) and any outside consultants
* payments to local researchers and their staff for their time and effort in recruiting test subjects and collecting data for the sponsor
* the cost of study materials and the charges incurred to ship them
* communication with the local researchers, including on-site monitoring by the CRO before and (in some cases) multiple times during the study
* one or more investigator training meetings
* expense incurred by the local researchers, such as pharmacy fees, IRB fees and postage
* any payments to subjects enrolled in the trial
* the expense of treating a test subject who develops a medical condition caused by the study drug
These expenses are incurred over several years.

In the US, sponsors may receive a 50 percent tax credit for clinical trials conducted on drugs being developed for the treatment of orphan diseases. National health agencies, such as the US National Institutes of Health, offer grants to investigators who design clinical trials that attempt to answer research questions of interest to the agency. In these cases, the investigator who writes the grant and administers the study acts as the sponsor, and coordinates data collection from any other sites. These other sites may or may not be paid for participating in the study, depending on the amount of the grant and the amount of effort expected from them. Using internet resources can, in some cases, reduce the economic burden.

===Investigators===

Investigators are often compensated for their work in clinical trials. These amounts can be small, just covering a partial salary for research assistants and the cost of any supplies (usually the case with national health agency studies), or be substantial and include &quot;overhead&quot; that allows the investigator to pay the research staff during times between clinical trials.

===Subjects===

Participants in Phase I drug trials do not gain any direct health benefit from taking part. They are generally paid a fee for their time, with payments regulated and not related to any risk involved. Motivations of healthy volunteers is not limited to financial reward and may include other motivations such as contributing to science and others. In later phase trials, subjects may not be paid to ensure their motivation for participating with potential for a health benefit or contributing to medical knowledge. Small payments may be made for study-related expenses such as travel or as compensation for their time in providing follow-up information about their health after the trial treatment ends.

==Participant recruitment and participation==

Phase 0 and Phase I drug trials seek healthy volunteers. Most other clinical trials seek patients who have a specific disease or medical condition. The diversity observed in society should be reflected in clinical trials through the appropriate inclusion of ethnic minority populations. Patient recruitment or participant recruitment plays a significant role in the activities and responsibilities of sites conducting clinical trials.

All volunteers being considered for a trial are required to undertake a medical screening. Requirements differ according to the trial needs, but typically volunteers would be screened in a medical laboratory for:
* Measurement of the electrical activity of the heart (ECG)
* Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature
* Blood sampling
* Urine sampling
* Weight and height measurement
* Drug abuse testing
* Pregnancy testing

It has been observed that participants in clinical trials are disproportionately white. Often, minorities are not informed about clinical trials. One recent systematic review of the literature found that race/ethnicity as well as sex were not well-represented nor at times even tracked as participants in a large number of clinical trials of hearing loss management in adults. This may reduce the validity of findings in respect of non-white patients by not adequately representing the larger populations.

===Locating trials===

Depending on the kind of participants required, sponsors of clinical trials, or contract research organizations working on their behalf, try to find sites with qualified personnel as well as access to patients who could participate in the trial. Working with those sites, they may use various recruitment strategies, including patient databases, newspaper and radio advertisements, flyers, posters in places the patients might go (such as doctor&#x27;s offices), and personal recruitment of patients by investigators.

Volunteers with specific conditions or diseases have additional online resources to help them locate clinical trials. For example, the Fox Trial Finder connects Parkinson&#x27;s disease trials around the world to volunteers who have a specific set of criteria such as location, age, and symptoms. Other disease-specific services exist for volunteers to find trials related to their condition. Volunteers may search directly on ClinicalTrials.gov to locate trials using a registry run by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and National Library of Medicine. There also is software that allows clinicians to find trial options for an individual patient based on data such as genomic data.

===Research===

The risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model analyzes social implications that affect attitudes and decision making pertaining to clinical trials. People who hold a higher stake or interest in the treatment provided in a clinical trial showed a greater likelihood of seeking information about clinical trials. Cancer patients reported more optimistic attitudes towards clinical trials than the general population. Having a more optimistic outlook on clinical trials also leads to greater likelihood of enrolling.

===Matching===
Matching involves a systematic comparison of a patient&#x27;s clinical and demographic information against the eligibility criteria of various trials. Methods include:
* Manual: Healthcare providers or clinical trial coordinators manually review patient records and available trial criteria to identify potential matches. This might also include manually searching in clinical trial databases.
* Electronic health records (EHR). Some systems integrate with EHRs to automatically flag patients that may be eligible for trials based on their medical data. These systems may leverage machine learning, artificial intelligence or precision medicine methods to more effectively match patients to trials. These methods are faced with the challenge of overcoming the limitations of EHR records such as omissions and logging errors.
* Direct-to-patient services: Resources are specialized to support patients in finding clinical trials through online platforms, hotlines, and personalized support.

==Decentralized trials==
Although trials are commonly conducted at major medical centers, some participants are excluded due to the distance and expenses required for travel, leading to hardship, disadvantage, and inequity for participants, especially those in rural and underserved communities. Therefore, the concept of a &quot;decentralized clinical trial&quot; that minimizes or eliminates the need for patients to travel to sites, is now more widespread, a capability improved by telehealth and wearable technologies.

<text>Minishogi (5五将棋 &quot;gogo shōgi&quot; &quot;5V chess&quot; or &quot;5×5 chess&quot;) is a modern variant of shogi (Japanese chess). The game was invented (or rediscovered) around 1970 by Shigenobu Kusumoto of Osaka, Japan. The rules are nearly identical to those of standard shogi, with the exception that it is played on a 5x5 board and a reduced number of pieces, and each player&#x27;s promotion zone consists only of the rank furthest from the player.

==Rules of the game==
===Objective===
Like in standard shogi, each player aims to checkmate the opponent&#x27;s king.

===Game equipment===
Two players play on a board ruled into a grid of five ranks (rows) by five files (columns). The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color.

Each player begins with a set of 6 wedge-shaped pieces; these are:
*1 king 
*1 rook 
*1 bishop 
*1 gold general 
*1 silver general 
*1 pawn 

Their movements are identical to those of their namesakes in standard shogi. 

===Setup===

Each player places their pieces in the positions shown below, pointing towards the opponent.
In the rank nearest to the player: 
*The king is placed in the leftmost file; 
*The gold general is placed in the adjacent file to the king;
*The silver general is placed adjacent to the gold general;
*The bishop is placed adjacent to the silver general;
*The rook is placed in the rightmost file, adjacent to the bishop.

That is, the setup of the first rank is as follows: |K|G|S|B|R|.

In the second rank, each player places the pawn in the same file as the king (i.e. directly in front of the king).

===Promotion===
Like in standard shogi, a piece may (but is not obliged to) be promoted when it is moved into, within, or out of the promotion zone. The zone only lies within the rank furthest from the player (unlike in the standard game, where it lies within the last &quot;three&quot; ranks). All pieces promote the same way as their namesakes in standard shogi (and likewise, the kings and gold generals do not promote at all). The pawns &quot;must&quot; be promoted once they reach the furthest rank (since otherwise they would not have any legal moves).

===Drops===
The rules for dropping pieces are identical to those in standard shogi: all dropped pieces must start unpromoted (even if they have been captured as promoted pieces and/or are dropped into the furthest rank); a pawn may not be dropped onto the furthest rank, or onto a square that results in an immediate checkmate; the two pawns may not lie in the same file when they belong to the same player.

===Repetition===
If the same position (with the same side to move and same pieces in hand) occurs for the fourth time, the game ends and the final result is a loss for the player that made the very first move in the game (this is different from regular shogi, where such a scenario would result in a draw). The only exception to this rule is when one player perpetually checks the opponent; in that case the checking side loses the game.

==Strategy==
Due to the small size of the board, the rook and bishop lose a significant amount of their relative strength, relative to the gold and silver generals. Due to the reduced ability for each player to achieve king safety, threats of checkmate are always present, and having pieces on hand introduces many checkmate threats that diminish the opponent&#x27;s mobility. This must be balanced against the defense of one&#x27;s own king by friendly pieces on the board.

As in many variants of chess, a common strategy is to develop the less powerful pieces (i.e. gold and silver generals) before the more powerful pieces (i.e. rooks and bishops).

===Handicap play===
The traditional rook, bishop, and 2-piece handicaps in shogi may be applied to this game. Additionally, there exist 3-piece, 4-piece, and even naked-king handicaps. In naked-king-handicap game, black can theoretically force a mate in 8 plies.

==Computer Minishogi==
Minishogi is popular with artificial-intelligence researchers and there are many strong programs that play it. Due to minishogi being smaller, it can play a much stronger game than on the standard board size. Several tournaments in which such programs can enter to compete against each other are organized yearly, often associated with scientific conferences. The most prestigious of these tournaments is the UEC Cup, organized by the University of Electro-Communication in Tokyo. Other such events are TAAI (in Taiwan) and the ICGA Computer Olympiad.

Minishogi can use the same standard protocols as regular shogi for communicating between graphical interfaces (which display a shogi board) and the artificial intelligence modules (&#x27;engines&#x27;), such as USI (Universal Shogi Interface) or XBoard protocol. There are several free strong minishogi engines that can be used with the WinBoard interface, which support both XBoard protocol and USI.

<doc id="241721" wikidata="Q151231" url="?curid=241721" title="Annie Lennox">
<text>Ann Lennox (born 25 December 1954) is a Scottish singer-songwriter, political activist and philanthropist. After achieving moderate success in the late 1970s as part of the new wave band the Tourists, she and fellow musician Dave Stewart went on to achieve international success in the 1980s as Eurythmics. Appearing in the 1983 music video for &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; with orange cropped hair and wearing a man&#x27;s lounge suit, the BBC wrote, &quot;all eyes were on Annie Lennox, the singer whose powerful androgynous look defied the male gaze&quot;. Subsequent hits with Eurythmics include &quot;There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)&quot;, &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot;.

Lennox embarked on a solo career in 1992 with her debut album, &quot;Diva&quot;, which produced several hit singles including &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot;. The same year, she performed &quot;Love Song for a Vampire&quot; for &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. Her 1995 studio album &quot;Medusa&quot; includes cover versions of songs such as &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s and &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;. To date, she has released six solo studio albums and a compilation album, &quot;The Annie Lennox Collection&quot; (2009). With eight Brit Awards, which includes being named Best British Female Artist a record six times, Lennox has been named the &quot;Brits Champion of Champions&quot;. She has also collected four Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award. In 2002, Lennox received a Billboard Century Award; the highest accolade from &quot;Billboard&quot;. In 2004 she received the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Into the West&quot;, written for the soundtrack to the feature film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

Lennox&#x27;s vocal range is contralto. She has been named &quot;The Greatest White Soul Singer Alive&quot; by VH1 and one of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In June 2013 the Official Charts Company called her &quot;the most successful female British artist in UK music history&quot;. By June 2008, including her work with Eurythmics, Lennox had sold over 80 million records worldwide. As part of a one-hour symphony of British Music, Lennox performed &quot;Little Bird&quot; during the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London. At the 2015 Ivor Novello Awards Lennox was made a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (The Ivors Academy), the first woman to receive the honour. Lennox and her Eurythmics partner Dave Stewart were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020, and the duo were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.

In addition to her career as a musician, Lennox is also a political and social activist, raising money and awareness for HIV/AIDS as it affects women and children in Africa. She founded the Sing campaign in 2007 and founded a women&#x27;s empowerment charity called The Circle in 2008. In 2011 Lennox was appointed an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II for her &quot;tireless charity campaigns and championing of humanitarian causes&quot;. On 4 June 2012 she performed at the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Concert in front of Buckingham Palace. In 2017, Lennox was appointed Glasgow Caledonian University&#x27;s first female chancellor.

==Early life==
Lennox was born on Christmas Day 1954 in Torry, Aberdeen, Scotland. She is the daughter of Dorothy Farquharson (née Ferguson; 1930–2003) and Thomas Allison Lennox (1925–1986).

Lennox went to the Aberdeen High School for Girls (which since became Harlaw Academy secondary school) where she was encouraged by her parents to explore her artistic qualities. She excelled at music, poetry and artwork. Here she learned to play the flute and the piano. She also sang in the choir and later played in symphony orchestras and military bands, and each year took part in the Aberdeen Music Festival. Lennox attended Dalcroze Eurhythmics classes while at high school. Eurhythmics, with its English spelling, is an approach to music education developed by the Swiss composer Emile Jaques-Dalcroze. The word Eurhythmics is derived from Greek and means &quot;good flow&quot;. The band, Eurythmics, adopted the French spelling.
In 1971, Lennox began studying on a three-year Music Performance degree course at the Royal Academy of Music in London. It is one of a small number of quite elite British music conservatories predominantly for classical music study at third level. At college in London she studied flute, piano and harpsichord for nearly three years. Although Lennox studied for close to the duration of the course she did not finish her studies at the college. She found the amount of time devoted to music practice required to become a professional classical musician obsessive and felt that she was unconnected with the &quot;whole cultural aspect&quot;. Lennox lived on a student grant and worked at part-time jobs for extra money. She was unhappy with the direction she was going in and doubted her own talent when compared to her student contemporaries while at the Royal Academy and deliberated on what other direction she could take.

Lennox&#x27;s flute teacher&#x27;s final report stated: &quot;Ann has not always been sure of where to direct her efforts, though lately she has been more committed. She is very, very able, however.&quot; Two years later, Lennox reported to the academy: &quot;I have had to work as a waitress, barmaid, and shop assistant to keep me when not in musical work.&quot; Lennox attended the Dalcroze Eurhythmics Spring Course of 1974. She also played and sang with a few bands, such as Windsong, during the period of her course.

In 2017, the academy awarded her an honorary degree of Doctorate. In her acceptance speech of her honorary Doctorate, Lennox said, &quot;Many of my life experiences can be described as unconventional, idiosyncratic and synchronistic – as this event [graduation ceremony] proves to be no exception. By rights, I feel I’m not entitled to be here – but as John Lennon once famously said…&#x27;Life is what happens to you while you’re making other plans.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==
===1976–1990: Dragon&#x27;s Playground, the Tourists and Eurythmics===

In 1976, Lennox was a flute player with a band called Dragon&#x27;s Playground, leaving before they appeared on ITV&#x27;s talent show &quot;New Faces&quot;. From 1977 to 1980, she was the lead singer of the Tourists, a British pop band and her first collaboration with Dave Stewart.

Lennox and Stewart&#x27;s second collaboration, the 1980s synth-pop duo Eurythmics, resulted in her most notable fame, as the duo&#x27;s alto, soul-tinged lead singer. Early in Eurythmics&#x27; career, Lennox was known for her androgyny, wearing suits and once impersonating Elvis Presley. Eurythmics released a long line of hit singles in the 1980s, including &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; (a U.S. number one and UK number two), &quot;There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)&quot; (UK number one), &quot;Love Is A Stranger&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Rain Again&quot;, &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; (Australian number one), &quot;Missionary Man&quot; (Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group), &quot;You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart&quot;, &quot;Thorn in My Side&quot;, &quot;The Miracle of Love&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Why&quot;. Although Eurythmics never officially disbanded, Lennox made a fairly clear break from Stewart in 1990. Thereafter, she began her solo career.

Lennox and Stewart reconvened Eurythmics in the late 1990s, resulting in the 1999 release of &quot;Peace&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album of new material in ten years. A subsequent concert tour was completed, with profits going to Greenpeace and Amnesty International. Lennox has received eight Brit Awards, including being named Best British Female Artist a record six times. Four of the awards were given during her time with Eurythmics, and another was given to the duo for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1999.

The 1988 single &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot; was a duet with Al Green recorded for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Scrooged&quot;. Though it was produced by Dave Stewart, it was credited to Lennox and Green. This one-off single peaked at No. 9 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, 6 in Australia, and was a top 40 hit in the UK. Lennox performed the song &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot;, a Cole Porter song, that same year for a cameo appearance in the Derek Jarman film &quot;Edward II&quot;. She then appeared with David Bowie and the surviving members of Queen at 1992&#x27;s Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium, performing &quot;Under Pressure&quot;.

===1992–1993: Solo career and &quot;Diva&quot;===
Lennox began working with former Trevor Horn protégé Stephen Lipson, beginning with her 1992 solo debut album, &quot;Diva&quot;. During an interview with the BBC in 1992 ahead of the release of the album, Lennox claimed that she debated with herself whether to begin writing a solo album, claiming that she thought of other things she could do but concluded &quot;it all comes back to writing songs&quot;, stating that songwriting &quot;affirms who I am&quot; and acknowledging being a songwriter as &quot;part of my identify&quot;. Lennox claimed that, during the songwriting process for &quot;Diva&quot;, she did &quot;not miss Dave [Stewart]&quot; (her partner with Eurythmics), claiming that they both &quot;spent so much time together it became frayed&quot;. She did, however, state that she wishes Dave well and that she was &quot;sure he would say the same for me&quot;.

&quot;Diva&quot; was a commercial and critical success, charting No. 1 in the UK, No. 7 in Australia, No. 6 in Germany, and No. 23 in the U.S. where it went double platinum. Lennox&#x27;s profile was boosted by &quot;Diva&quot; singles, which included &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot;. &quot;Why&quot; won an MTV Award for Best Female Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, while the video for &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot;, set in the Rococo period, featured actors Hugh Laurie and John Malkovich. &quot;Little Bird&quot; also formed a double A-side with &quot;Love Song for a Vampire&quot;, a soundtrack cut for Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1992 movie &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. The B-side of her single &quot;Precious&quot; was a self-penned song called &quot;Step by Step&quot;, which was later a hit for Whitney Houston for the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;. The song &quot;Keep Young and Beautiful&quot; was included on the CD release as a bonus track (the original vinyl album had only ten tracks).

The album entered the UK album chart at no.1 and has since sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK alone, being certified quadruple platinum. It was also a success in the US where it was a top 30 hit and has sold in excess of 2,700,000 copies. In 1993, the album was included in &quot;Q magazine&quot; list of the &quot;50 Best Albums of 1992&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine (25 June 1992, p. 41) described the album as &quot;...state-of-the-art soul pop...&quot; and it is included in Rolling Stone&#x27;s (13 May 1999, p. 56) &quot;Essential Recordings of the 90&#x27;s&quot; list. The album won Best British Album at the 1993 Brit Awards.

===1995–2000: &quot;Medusa&quot; and return to Eurythmics===

Although Lennox&#x27;s profile decreased for a period because of her desire to bring up her two children outside of the media&#x27;s glare, she continued to record. Her second album, &quot;Medusa&quot;, was released in March 1995. It consisted solely of cover songs, all originally recorded by male artists including Bob Marley, The Clash, and Neil Young. It entered the UK album chart at No. 1 and peaked in Australia at No. 5, and in the US at number 11, spending 60 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and selling over 2,000,000 to date in the United States. It has achieved double platinum status in both the UK and the US. The album yielded four UK singles: &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s (which entered the UK singles chart at No. 2, Lennox&#x27;s highest ever solo peak), &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot; and &quot;Something So Right&quot;. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammy Awards of 1996, losing to &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot; by Joni Mitchell and instead winning Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the single &quot;No More &#x27;I Love You&#x27;s. Although Lennox declined to tour for the album, she did perform a large scale one-off concert in New York&#x27;s Central Park, which was filmed and later released on home video. Lennox provided an extensive solo vocal performance (without lyrics) for the soundtrack score of the film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; in 1995.

Managed by Simon Fuller since the beginning of her solo career, he said that Lennox played an important but unheralded role in the success of the Spice Girls, encouraging the group to &quot;ham up&quot; their characters, which helped them top the charts around the world. In 1997, Lennox re-recorded the Eurythmics track &quot;Angel&quot; for the &quot;Diana, Princess of Wales: Tribute&quot; album, and also recorded the song &quot;Mama&quot; for &quot;The Avengers&quot; soundtrack album. In 1998, following the death of a mutual friend (former Tourists member Peet Coombes), she re-united with Dave Stewart. Following their first performance together in eight years at a record company party, Stewart and Lennox began writing and recording together for the first time since 1989. This resulted in the album &quot;Peace&quot;. The title was designed to reflect the duo&#x27;s ongoing concern with global conflict and world peace. The record was promoted with a concert on the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior II, where they played a mixture of old and new songs. &quot;I Saved the World Today&quot; was the lead single, reaching number eleven on the UK singles chart. Another single, released at the beginning of 2000, &quot;17 Again&quot;, made the UK top 40, and topped the US dance chart. In 2002, Lennox received a Billboard Century Award; the highest accolade from &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, with Editor-in-Chief Timothy White describing her as one of &quot;the most original and unforgettably affecting artists in the modern annals of popular music.&quot;

===2003–2007: &quot;Bare&quot; and Eurythmics return===
In 2003, Lennox released her third solo album, &quot;Bare&quot;. The album peaked at No. 3 in the UK, No. 10 in Australia, and No. 4 in the US – her highest-charting album in the US to date. She embarked on her first tour as a solo artist to promote the album. The tour, simply titled Solo Tour, pre-dated the release of the album and visited both the US and Europe, with only a two-night stop in the UK at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in London. The album has been certified Gold in both the UK and the US and was nominated for Best Pop Album at the 46th Grammy Awards. The album was released with a DVD which included interviews and acoustic versions of songs by Lennox.

In 2004, Lennox won the Academy Award for Best Song for &quot;Into the West&quot; from the film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, which she co-wrote with screenwriter Fran Walsh and composer Howard Shore. Lennox performed the song live at the 76th Academy Awards. The song also won a Grammy award and a Golden Globe award. She had previously recorded &quot;Use Well the Days&quot; for the movie, which incorporates a number of quotations from Tolkien in its lyrics. This features on a bonus DVD included with the &quot;special edition&quot; of the movie&#x27;s soundtrack CD. In mid-2004, Lennox embarked on an extensive North American tour with Sting. In July 2005, Lennox performed at Live 8 in Hyde Park, London, along with Madonna, Sting, and other popular musicians.

In 2005, Lennox and Stewart collaborated on two new songs for their Eurythmics compilation album, &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, of which &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Life&quot; was released as a single in October 2005. The promotional video for the song features Lennox and Stewart performing in the present day, with images of past Eurythmics videos playing on television screens behind them. The single peaked at number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart and was a number-one US Dance hit. On 14 November 2005, Sony BMG repackaged and released Eurythmics&#x27; back catalogue as 2005 Deluxe Edition Reissues. Lennox also collaborated with Herbie Hancock doing the song &quot;Hush, Hush, Hush&quot; on his collaboration album, &quot;Possibilities&quot; in August 2005.

===2007–2008: &quot;Songs of Mass Destruction&quot; and AIDS activism===
Ending her long association with Stephen Lipson, Lennox&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Songs of Mass Destruction&quot;, was recorded in Los Angeles with veteran producer Glen Ballard (known for producing Alanis Morissette&#x27;s album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;). It was released on 1 October 2007, and was the last studio album of Lennox&#x27;s contract with BMG. It peaked at No. 7 in the UK and No. 9 in the US. Lennox stated that she believed the album consisted of &quot;twelve strong, powerful, really emotive songs that people can connect to&quot;. If she achieves that, she says, &quot;I can feel proud of [it], no matter if it sells ten copies or 50 million.&quot; Lennox described it as &quot;a dark album, but the world is a dark place. It&#x27;s fraught, it&#x27;s turbulent. Most people&#x27;s lives are underscored with dramas of all kinds: there&#x27;s ups, there&#x27;s downs – the flickering candle.&quot; She added, &quot;Half the people are drinking or drugging themselves to numb it. A lot of people are in pain.&quot;

The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Dark Road&quot;, released on 24 September 2007. Another song on the album, &quot;Sing&quot;, is a collaboration between Lennox and 23 prominent female artists: Anastacia, Isobel Campbell, Dido, Céline Dion, Melissa Etheridge, Fergie, Beth Gibbons, Faith Hill, Angelique Kidjo, Beverley Knight, Gladys Knight, k.d. lang, Madonna, Sarah McLachlan, Beth Orton, Pink, Kelis, Bonnie Raitt, Shakira, Shingai Shoniwa, Joss Stone, Sugababes, KT Tunstall, and Martha Wainwright. The song was recorded to raise money and awareness for the HIV/AIDS organisation Treatment Action Campaign. Included among the group of vocalists are TAC activist members&#x27; own vocal group known as The Generics, whose CD of music inspired Lennox to make &quot;Sing&quot;. To promote &quot;Songs of Mass Destruction&quot;, Lennox embarked on a primarily North American tour called Annie Lennox Sings, which lasted throughout October and November 2007.

===2008–2009: &quot;The Annie Lennox Collection&quot; and departure from Sony===

Finishing out her contract with Sony BMG, Lennox released the compilation album &quot;The Annie Lennox Collection&quot;. Initially intended for release in September 2008, the release date was pushed back several months to allow Lennox to recuperate from a back injury. The compilation was eventually released in the US on 17 February 2009, and in the UK and Europe on 9 March 2009. Included on the track listing are songs from her four solo albums, one from the &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; soundtrack, and two new songs. One of these is a cover of Ash&#x27;s single, &quot;Shining Light&quot;. The other is a cover of a song by the English band Keane, originally the B-side of their first single in 2000. Lennox renamed the song from its original title &quot;Closer Now&quot; to &quot;Pattern of My Life&quot;. A limited 3-disc edition of the album included a DVD compilation featuring most of Lennox&#x27;s solo videos since 1992, and also featured a second CD of rarer songs including a version of R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; with Alicia Keys and Lennox&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Into the West&quot; from the third &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film. The album entered the UK Album Chart at No. 2 and remained in the top 10 for seven weeks.

Lennox&#x27;s recording contract with Sony BMG concluded with the release of &quot;Songs of Mass Destruction&quot; and the subsequent retrospective album &quot;The Collection&quot;, and much was made in the press in late 2007/early 2008 about the apparent animosity between Lennox and the record company. Lennox stated that while on a trip to South Africa in December 2007 to appear at the 46664 campaign in Johannesburg, the regional company office of the label failed to return phone calls and e-mails she made to them for three weeks, and had completely failed to promote the Sing project as planned. Upon her return to the UK, Lennox met with the head of Sony BMG UK, Ged Docherty, who was &quot;mortified&quot; by the problems she had encountered with the South African branch. The debacle (partly inflamed by her blogging her dissatisfaction with the South African office) led to press reports that she was &quot;dropped&quot; by Sony BMG, which quickly clarified that their contract had been fulfilled and that it hoped she would consider signing a new one. The British tabloid, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, subsequently printed a retraction of its story about her being dropped by the label.

===2010–2013: Island Records and &quot;A Christmas Cornucopia&quot;===
In August 2010, Lennox signed a new contract with Island Records in the UK and Decca Records in the U.S., both part of the Universal Music Group. Her first release was a Christmas album entitled &quot;A Christmas Cornucopia&quot;, issued on 15 November 2010. The album is a collection of Lennox&#x27;s interpretations of traditional festive songs such as &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;The First Noel&quot;, along with one new composition, &quot;Universal Child&quot;, which was released as a download-only single on 13 October 2010. Lennox had previously showcased the song on the &quot;American Idol Gives Back&quot; TV show in April 2010. She sang the song &quot;Angels from the Realms of Glory&quot; from the album for the TNT special &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot;.

A music video was produced for a second single from the album, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;. Lennox also performed the track on the UK chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot; in December 2010, and was also interviewed. According to Metacritic, &quot;A Christmas Cornucopia&quot; has gained &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Ian Wade of BBC Music gave the album a very positive review, saying &quot;this collection could find itself becoming as much a part of the holiday season as arguments with loved ones.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; awarded the album 3.5/5 and said &quot;Lennox seems more inspired on &quot;A Christmas Cornucopia&quot; than she has in years.&quot; John Hunt of &quot;Qatar Today&quot; magazine gave the album 9/10 and said &quot;in particular, the vocal work and musical arrangement of &#x27;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&#x27; are impactful to the point of being intimidating.&quot;
On 4 June 2012, Lennox performed, as part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Concert, in front of Buckingham Palace in London and on 12 August she performed &quot;Little Bird&quot; at the 2012 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony.

===2014–2019: &quot;Nostalgia&quot;===
In October 2014, Lennox released her sixth solo album, &quot;Nostalgia&quot;. The album is a collection of Lennox&#x27;s childhood favourite soul, jazz and blues songs. Critic Mike Wass of &quot;Idolator&quot; stated that Lennox &quot;puts her own inimitable spin&quot; on the selected tracks. The lead single &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; received its first radio play on 15 September 2014 by Ken Bruce on BBC Radio 2. Upon release, the album entered the UK and US Top 10, and reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Jazz Albums chart. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. On 28 January 2015, Lennox performed a live concert at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles entitled &quot;An Evening of Nostalgia with Annie Lennox&quot;. The show aired on PBS in the US in April 2015, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray internationally in May 2015.

===2019–present: &quot;Lepidoptera&quot;===
In May 2019, Lennox released &quot;Lepidoptera&quot;, an EP containing four extemporised piano songs. The album serves as a companion piece to her art installation &quot;Now I Let You Go...&quot; at MASS moca. It is Lennox&#x27;s first independently distributed record.

===Charity and political activism===

Lennox appeared on stage at the 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Concert and commenced activist work with the Sing Foundation afterwards. In 1990, Lennox recorded a version of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot; for the Cole Porter tribute album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot;, a benefit for AIDS awareness. A video was also produced. Lennox has been a public supporter of Amnesty International and Greenpeace for many years, and she and Dave Stewart donated all of the profits from Eurythmics&#x27; 1999 Peacetour to both charities. Concerned by Tibet freedom, she supported Amnesty International campaigns for the release of Tibetan prisoners Palden Gyatso and Ngawang Choephel.

Lennox was a signatory to the &quot;No war on Iraq&quot; campaign started in 2003, her album &quot;Songs of Mass Destruction&quot; and her rendition of &quot;Dark Road&quot; were deeply critical of the war. In conversation with Melvyn Bragg in 2006, she expressed her anger at how the UK was misled over Iraq&#x27;s alleged &#x27;weapons of mass destruction&#x27;.

After being forced to pull out of performing at Live Aid held at Wembley Stadium in 1985 due to a serious throat infection, Lennox appeared at Live 8 held in Hyde Park, London in 2005. In 2006, in response to her humanitarian work, Lennox became patron of the Master&#x27;s Course in &quot;Humanitarian and Development Practice&quot; for Oxford Brookes University. In October 2006, Lennox spoke at the British House of Commons about the need for children in the UK to help their counterparts in Africa. On 25 April 2007, Lennox performed &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; during the &quot;American Idol&quot; &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; fundraising drive. Lennox&#x27;s 2007 song &quot;Sing&quot; was born out of her involvement with Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 46664 campaign and Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), both of which are human rights groups which seek education and health care for those affected by HIV. In December 2007, Lennox established The SING Campaign, an organisation dedicated to raising funds and awareness for women and children affected by HIV and AIDS.

On 11 December 2007, she performed in the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway together with a variety of artists, which was broadcast to over 100 countries. Lennox appeared at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute in June 2008 and then led a rally against the Gaza War in London on 3 January 2009.

In 2008, Lennox founded The Circle of Women, known as The Circle, a private charitable organisation to network and fund-raise for women&#x27;s projects around the world. Also in 2008, Lennox backed the principle of an independent Scotland.

Lennox opened the 2009 Edinburgh Festival of Politics with commentary on Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s approach to HIV/AIDS prevention in Africa. She said that the Pope&#x27;s denunciation of condoms on his recent tour of Africa had caused &quot;tremendous harm&quot; and she criticised the Roman Catholic Church for causing widespread confusion on the continent. Lennox also condemned the media&#x27;s obsession with &quot;celebrity culture&quot; for keeping the AIDS pandemic off the front page. During her address, Lennox wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the words &quot;HIV positive&quot;. Lennox wore similar T-shirts at the 25th Anniversary Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame concert at Madison Square Garden on 30 October 2009, during her appearance on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on 30 November 2009 (where she performed the new song &quot;Full Steam&quot;, a duet with singer David Gray), during a recorded performance for &quot;American Idol&quot; during a 21 April 2010 fundraiser, entitled Idol Gives Back, and during a performance on the live Comic Relief show on 18 March 2011.

 In November 2009, Lennox was awarded the Peace Summit Award 2009 by the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates for her engagement in the fight against the HIV pandemic in South Africa. In June 2010, she was named as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for AIDS, a role that continues . Lennox also works with other organisations such as Oxfam, Amnesty International and the British Red Cross in regard to the issue. Lennox also supports the Burma Campaign UK, a non-governmental organisation that addresses the suffering in Burma and promotes democratisation.

In December 2010, it was confirmed that Lennox was in the New Years Honours List and would become an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of her humanitarian work. She received the award from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on 28 June 2011.

In November 2013, Lennox received the Music Industry Trusts Award for her career achievements in music and her charity commitments. Elton John said of her award; &quot;It is so well deserved and not only for your extraordinary contribution to music and songwriting but also for your outstanding and tireless work as an HIV and AIDS activist and supporter of women&#x27;s rights,&quot; while Adele stated; &quot;Annie Lennox has been a constant part of my life. An example of a brilliant talent that exudes excellence and influence on everyone.&quot;

In 2015, Lennox attended, performed at and hosted several charitable events including: the 50th Amnesty International Annual Conference where she was a guest speaker, Elton John and David Furnish&#x27;s at home Gala in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation where she performed, held a screening of He Named Me Malala, and hosted a Mothers2mothers 15th Anniversary gala. In 2016 Lennox was awarded the Elle Style Awards &#x27;Outstanding Achievement&#x27; award, and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society award, the Livingstone Medal, in recognition of her outstanding contribution to the fight against AIDS and support of women&#x27;s rights.

Lennox signed the October 2023 Artists4Ceasefire open letter calling for a ceasefire during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. In February 2024, at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, during an in memoriam segment where she performed late singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s song Nothing Compares 2 U, Lennox repeated her call for a ceasefire and &quot;peace in the world&quot;.

In 2023, Lennox became the Patron of Dalcroze UK, a charitable organisation that promotes Dalcroze Eurhythmics, the approach to music education that inspired the band name, Eurythmics.

===Relationship with the LGBTQ+ community===

Lennox&#x27;s longtime support for LGBT rights has helped garner a significant following within the LGBTQ+ community. According to &quot;The Advocate&quot;, &quot;her distinctive voice and provocative stage persona have made Lennox a longtime gay icon.&quot;

Known for her androgynous look in the 1980s–first widely seen in the 1983 music video for &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; where she had close-cropped, orange-coloured hair, and wore a man&#x27;s suit brandishing a cane, a video which made her a household name. The BBC wrote, &quot;all eyes were on Annie Lennox, the singer whose powerful androgynous look defied the male gaze&quot;. Lennox was viewed as the female version of Boy George and they appeared together on the front cover of the British music magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot; in December 1983. This was followed by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine in the US who ran an issue which featured Lennox and George on the cover of its 23 January 1984 edition with the caption &quot;Britain Rocks America – Again&quot;, marking the Second British Invasion. Her gender-bending image was also explored in other Eurythmics videos such as &quot;Love Is a Stranger&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl?&quot; and she impersonated Elvis Presley at the 1984 Grammy Awards.

===Exhibition===
In conjunction with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Lennox put many items from her collection—costumes, accessories, photographs, awards, ephemera from her political campaigns, and personal belongings—on display. This collection, which spanned her entire career, along with music videos and interviews, became &quot;The House of Annie Lennox&quot; at the institution from 15 September 2011 to 26 February 2012. An expanded version of the exhibit was later installed at The Lowry in Salford, England from 17 March 2012 to 17 June, before moving to Aberdeen for twelve weeks.

===Other work===
On 31 March 2014, British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer launched the new iteration of its &#x27;Leading Ladies&#x27; marketing campaign featuring influential British women, which included Lennox, Emma Thompson, Rita Ora and Baroness Lawrence.

==Music videos==

Both as part of Eurythmics and in her solo career, Lennox has made over 60 music promo videos. The 1987 Eurythmics album &quot;Savage&quot; and her 1992 solo album &quot;Diva&quot; were both accompanied by video albums, both directed by Sophie Muller. The music video for &quot;Missionary Man&quot; featured stop-animation techniques and received five nominations at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards. Actors Hugh Laurie and John Malkovich appeared in the music video for &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot; in period costume, while the video for &quot;Little Bird&quot; paid homage to the different images and personas that have appeared in some of Lennox&#x27;s previous videos. The clip features Lennox performing on stage with several lookalikes (male and female) that represent her personas from &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Walking on Broken Glass&quot;, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, &quot;Beethoven (I Love To Listen To)&quot;, &quot;I Need a Man&quot;, &quot;Thorn in My Side&quot;, &quot;There Must Be an Angel&quot;, and even her stage image from the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert.

==Personal life==
Lennox has been married three times. She and Dave Stewart were in a relationship for three years in the late 1970s, before they formed Eurythmics. They never married.

Her first marriage, from 1984 to 1985, was to German Hare Krishna devotee Radha Raman. From 1988 to 2000, Lennox was married to Israeli film and record producer Uri Fruchtmann and they lived in The Grove, Highgate. The couple have two daughters, Lola and Tali. A son, Daniel, was stillborn in 1988.

While fundraising in 2009, Lennox met Mitch Besser, who had started an AIDS charity in Africa. Besser had divorce proceedings brought against him in April 2012. On 15 September 2012 Lennox married Besser at a private ceremony in London. He is the brother of medical doctor/executive Richard E. Besser.

In September 2012, Lennox featured in Series 9 of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, in which she discovered that her great-great-grandmother Jessie Fraser worked at the Broadford Flax Mill in Aberdeen. Her maternal grandmother, Dora Paton, was a dairy maid at the Balmoral Royal Estate and her maternal grandfather, William Ferguson, was a gamekeeper also at Balmoral.

Both of Lennox&#x27;s parents died of cancer. Lennox is agnostic and a feminist. Lennox became a vegetarian at age 29. In the 2010 &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of British millionaires from the world of music, Lennox was estimated to have a fortune of £30 million.

<doc id="241732" wikidata="Q463520" url="?curid=241732" title="American Basketball League (1996–1998)">
<text>The American Basketball League, often abbreviated to the ABL of 1996 was a professional women&#x27;s basketball league in the United States. At the same time the ABL was being formed, the National Basketball Association (NBA) was creating the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). The ABL began league competition in the Fall of 1996, while the WNBA launched its first game in June 1997. Both organizations came into existence during a surge in popularity for women&#x27;s basketball in the United States that followed the perfect 35–0 national championship season for the Connecticut Huskies in 1995 and the undefeated, gold medal-winning performance of the United States Women&#x27;s basketball team at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

The ABL lasted two full seasons: 1996–97 and 1997–98. The Atlanta Glory and Long Beach Stingrays folded prior to the start of the 1998–99 season, and were replaced by two expansion teams, the Chicago Condors and Nashville Noise. On December 22, 1998, with almost no warning, the ABL declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and suspended operations. Each team had played between 12 and 15 games of the 1998–99 season.

The ABL got off the ground before the WNBA, and at least early on its quality of play was higher than the rival league. This was partly due to the league&#x27;s signing of a majority of players from the 1996 USA women&#x27;s national team. Although the WNBA was bankrolled by the NBA, the ABL offered higher salaries. The two leagues did not compete directly; the ABL played during the winter while the WNBA played during the summer. However, this arrangement put the ABL in competition with the established men&#x27;s NBA for an audience. Ultimately, the ABL found the WNBA&#x27;s stronger financial resources—augmented by the NBA&#x27;s marketing machine—to be too much to overcome.

The league operated as a single-entity structure, which was intended to control costs until it found its feet. However, it also meant that even the most basic decisions related to team operations had to go through the league office in Palo Alto, California. The ABL was also under-financed.

Of all the ABL cities, Chicago, Seattle, and Atlanta now have WNBA teams.

<doc id="241734" wikidata="Q3048125" url="?curid=241734" title="Edmund Pendleton">
<text>Edmund Pendleton (September 9, 1721 – October 23, 1803) was an American planter, politician, lawyer, and judge. He served in the Virginia legislature before and during the American Revolutionary War, becoming the first speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates (which succeeded the House of Burgesses terminated by Virginia&#x27;s last colonial Governor, Lord Dunmore). Pendleton attended the First Continental Congress as one of Virginia&#x27;s delegates alongside George Washington and Patrick Henry, signed the Continental Association, and led the conventions both wherein Virginia declared independence (1776) and adopted the United States Constitution (1788).

Unlike his sometime political rival Henry, Pendleton was a moderate who initially hoped for reconciliation rather than revolt. With Thomas Jefferson and George Wythe, Pendleton revised Virginia&#x27;s legal code after the break with Britain. To contemporaries, Pendleton may have distinguished himself most as a judge, particularly in the appellate roles in which he spent his final 25 years, including leadership of what is now known as the Supreme Court of Virginia.

On hearing of his death, Congress agreed to wear badges of mourning for 30 days and expressed &quot;their regret that another star is fallen from the splendid constellation of virtue and talents which guided the people of the United States, in their struggle for independence&quot;.

==Early life==
Pendleton was born in Caroline County, Virginia, to Mary Bishop Taylor, whose young husband (and father of her six other children), Henry Pendleton, had died four months earlier. Pendleton&#x27;s maternal grandfather, James Taylor, was a large landowner in nearby Rappahannock County and may have helped raise the children until the widow remarried Edward Watkins two years later. James Taylor was born near Winchester in Hampshire, England in 1671 and had emigrated to America as a child with his parents in 1679. Pendleton&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Philip Pendleton was born in Norwich, England in 1650 and emigrated to America in 1674. When Edmund was 14 years old, he became apprenticed to Benjamin Robinson, clerk of the Caroline County Court, which is where he learned about political issues and soon began reading law books and learning legal procedures. In 1737, Pendleton was made clerk of the vestry of St. Mary&#x27;s Parish in Caroline, which began his involvement with practical church-related matters which would continue throughout his life.

==Career==

Pendleton received a license to practice law in April 1741. His success before nearby county courts, including as the prosecuting attorney for Essex County, allowed Pendleton to become a member of the General Court bar in October 1745. When attorneys were forbidden to practice before both courts, Pendleton chose the General Court and wrapped up his lower court practice—which allowed him to accept appointment as a justice of the peace for Caroline County in 1751. Pendleton also trained many young lawyers, including his nephews John Penn (later one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence) and John Taylor of Caroline (who became a U.S. Senator).

From 1752 to 1776, Pendleton represented Caroline County in the House of Burgesses. In May 1766, his mentor, the powerful speaker John Robinson died, and Pendleton was appointed one of the executors, thus becoming involved in the John Robinson estate scandal throughout the rest of his legal career.
Pendleton was on the Virginia Committee of Correspondence in 1773 and was a delegate to Continental Congress from Virginia in 1774. A moderate among the revolutionaries, in a resolution at the Second Continental Congress he said: &quot;The ground and foundation of the present unhappy dispute between the British Ministry and Parliament and America, is a Right claimed by the former to tax the Subjects of the latter without their consent, and not an inclination on our part to set up for independency, which we utterly disavow and wish to restore to a Constitutional Connection upon the most solid and reasonable basis.&quot;

Pendleton served as president of the Virginia Committee of Safety from August 16, 1775, to July 5, 1776 (effectively serving as governor of the colony), and as president of the Virginia Convention which authorized Virginia&#x27;s delegates to propose a resolution to move for the break from Britain and create a Declaration of Independence. The Convention debated the Virginia Declaration of Rights, drafted by George Mason, which served as a model for the Declaration of Independence. Pendleton proposed the modification in the statement of universal rights in Virginia&#x27;s declaration to exclude slaves, thus winning support of slave owners.

Fellow delegates elected Pendleton the first speaker of Virginia&#x27;s new House of Delegates, although he dislocated his hip in a fall from a horse in March 1777 which caused him to miss the first session. He used crutches the rest of his life. Pendleton, along with Thomas Jefferson and George Wythe, revised Virginia&#x27;s law code. He became judge of the High Court of Chancery in 1777. When Virginia created a Supreme Court of Appeals in 1778, Pendleton was appointed its first president and served until his death. In 1788 delegates unanimously selected Pendleton president of the Virginia Ratifying Convention; an event held at the Richmond Theatre. When Wythe took the chair, Pendleton addressing colleagues thus: &quot;...the people by us are peaceably assembled, to contemplate in the calm lights of mild philosophy, what Government is best calculated to promote their happiness, and secure their liberty. This I am sure we shall effect, if we do not lose sight of them by too much attachment to pictures of beauty, or horror, in our researches into antiquity, our travels for examples into remote regions&quot;.

==Family==
Pendleton married twice. He married Betty Roy on January 21, 1741, but she died in childbirth on November 16, 1742, and their infant son died shortly thereafter. On June 20, 1743, Pendleton married Sarah Pollard, daughter of Joseph Pollard and Priscilla Hoomes. Edmund and Sarah had no children, but in his extensive correspondence with contemporaries he often referred to their marriage as happy.

Since Pendleton had no direct descendants, his nieces, nephews, grandnieces, and grandnephews became his heirs. Pendleton did not grant freedom to any slaves in his will, unlike George Washington who similarly died without direct descendants, and Wythe who freed all his slaves in his lifetime. His brother John Pendleton&#x27;s son, also named Edmund Pendleton (1743–1827), added &quot;Jr.&quot; to distinguish himself from the judge whose principal heir he became. His oldest brother, James Pendleton, 19 years his senior, died in 1762 and left a large estate in Culpeper that Edmund administered for the widow and four children.

Many relatives were named after the judge, including grandnephews Edmund Pendleton (1776–1820, Edmund Jr.&#x27;s son), Edmund Pendleton (1790–1823, son of Nathaniel Pendleton&#x27;s son Philip), Edmund Pendleton (1786–1838, son of Henry Pendleton), and General Edmund Pendleton Gaines (1777–1849). His nephew Nathaniel Pendleton, Jr. distinguished himself in the American Revolution as an aide to General Nathaniel Greene and later became a lawyer and United States district judge for Georgia. In turn his son Edmund Henry Pendleton (1788–1862) also became a judge, as well as a U.S. congressman for New York. Another descendant, Edmund Monroe Pendleton (1815–1884), distinguished himself in developing fertilizer products, and became a professor of agriculture and horticulture at the University of Georgia.

Philip Clayton Pendleton (1779–1863) also served as a United States District Judge, and Philip P. Barbour (1783–1841) served as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court after serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives (his brother James Barbour was Virginia&#x27;s 18th governor as well as later a United States Senator and Secretary of War). Edmund Henry Pendleton (1843–1910) served in the 4th New York artillery as a Union staff officer in the Civil War; Reverend and Brigadier General William Nelson Pendleton (1809–1883) commanded the Rockbridge Artillery and Confederate artillery units in that war, and his son Sandie Pendleton (1840–1864) became a distinguished staff officer before dying in the Valley campaigns of 1864.

==Death and legacy==

Pendleton died in 1803, and after lying in state in Richmond he was buried at his home, Edmundsbury, in Caroline County. Because of the ravages of time upon the estate&#x27;s buildings, his body was removed circa 1907 and moved to Bruton Parish Church in what became Colonial Williamsburg. A memorial to Pendleton is located near the former estate. Pendleton County, West Virginia (formed 1788) and Pendleton County, Kentucky (formed 1798) are both named in Pendleton&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="241735" wikidata="Q8533" url="?curid=241735" title="Esslingen (district)">
<text>Esslingen is a (district) in the centre of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Rems-Murr, Göppingen, Reutlingen, Böblingen and the district-free city Stuttgart.

Until 15 October 1964, the district&#x27;s name was officially written as Landkreis Eßlingen.

==History==
The district dates back to the Oberamt Esslingen, which was created when the previously free imperial city of Esslingen am Neckar became part of Württemberg in 1803. It was changed several times in the course of history. From 1810 to 1818, it belonged to the &quot;Landvogtei Rothenberg&quot; and from 1818 until it was dissolved in 1924 to the &quot;Neckarkreis&quot;. In 1934 the &quot;Oberamt&quot; was renamed &quot;Kreis Eßlingen&quot; and the now termed &quot;Landkreis Eßlingen&quot; was enlarged by several municipalities of the dissolved &quot;Oberamt Stuttgart&quot; and the Kreise &quot;Schorndorf, Kirchheim unter Teck and Göppingen&quot; on 1 October 1938.

After several changes over the next century, it was converted into a district in 1938. Additionally, with the territorial Partition act on 24 April 1938, it was enlarged by adding several municipalities from the neighboring &quot;Amtsoberamt Stuttgart&quot;, &quot;Oberamt Schorndorf&quot;, &quot;Oberamt Kirchheim&quot; and &quot;Göppingen&quot;.

On 16 October 1964 the state government allowed the change from the previous spelling to the current &quot;Landkreis Esslingen.&quot;

In 1973, the district was merged with the district Nürtingen (without Grafenberg). In 1975, two municipalities (Leinfelden and Musberg) from the district Böblingen were added to give the district today&#x27;s borders.

Since the completion of the municipality reform the &quot;Landkreis Esslingen&quot; yet consists of 44 municipalities, amongst them 13 towns and among those, in turn, six Major district towns (Esslingen am Neckar, Filderstadt, Kirchheim unter Teck, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Nürtingen and Ostfildern). The districts largest town is Esslingen am Neckar, the smallest municipality Altdorf near Nürtingen. In 1980 German right-wing extremists of the &quot;Deutsche Aktionsgruppen&quot; committed a bomb attack on the administrative district office and the district administrators house.

==Geography==
The district is cut into two halves by the river Neckar. The west part is part of the Filder plain, while the east is part of the mountains of the Swabian Alb (&quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot;) and the Schurwald (part of the Swabian-Franconian mountain range).

At Plochingen the Fils flows into the Neckar river which leaves the district near Esslingen-Mettingen heading towards Stuttgart. With 229 m above sea level the water level of the Neckar near Mettingen represents the districts lowest Point. The highest point is located 830 m above SL in the Brucker Hölzle near Bissingen-Ochsenwang.

=== Transportation ===

==== Air ====
Stuttgart Airport lies on the eastern border of the city Leinfelden-Echterdingen. The runways are situated mostly on grounds belonging to Filderstadt-Bernhausen.

==== Public transport ====
Since 1845 the eventual Württembergische Staatsbahn runs from Stuttgart to the district City Esslingen, since 1846 as far as Plochingen and 1847 as Filsbahn towards the crossing of the Swabian Albs in the direction of Geislinger Steige–Ulm.

In 1859 the Neckar-Alb-Bahn was attached starting in Plochingen towards Nürtingen–Reutlingen an. From this railway the Teckbahn of the &quot;Kirchheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot; branched off in Wendlingen (back then Unterbohingen) in 1864 and extended as far as Oberlenningen by the Staatsbahn in 1899. Another meanwhile defunct local branch line was the railway line Kirchheim (Teck) Süd–Weilheim (Teck, opened in 1908.

The Tälesbahn Nürtingen–Neuffen belongs to the Württembergischen Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft since its opening in 1900.

Over the course of 100 years a diverse public transport network developed on Filder plains at the southern border of Stuttgart, the Filderbahn-Gesellschaft. In Leinfelden-Echterdingen the S-Bahn (S2 and S3) to Stuttgart Airport put into operation between 1989 and 1993 uses partly the alignment of the line Vaihingen–Echterdingen put in use by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1920, from which in 1928 in Leinfelden a line branched off heading to Waldenbuch. The S2 line was extended from the Airport to Filderstadt-Bernhausen in the autumn of 2001.

In Echterdingen they linked to the line Möhringen–Neuhausen, built by the Filderbahn-Gesellschaft in metre gauge in 1897 and changed to Standard gauge in 1902. The part Möhringen–Echterdingen was replaced by a connection Möhringen–Leinfelden, which was built as an electric cross-country railway in meter gauge in 1928 and had been – parallel to the standard gauge line to Neuhausen – extended up to Echterdingen Ort. Since 1990 a standard gauge light rail called &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; (Line U5) runs only up to Leinfelden Bahnhof instead from where the S-Bahn carries on.

In Esslingen the tram Straßenbahn Esslingen am Neckar was inaugurated in 1912, which from 1919 on provided a link to the tram network of the Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen (SSB). It was replaced in 1944 through the trolleybus Esslingen am Neckar. In 1926 the interurban tram Esslingen–Nellingen–Denkendorf (END) was added, which did run up to the Filder until 1978 as well. Unlike the Filderbahn lines not from the west but rather from the northern side. Since 1929 it had a branch line from Nellingen towards Neuhausen.

Regarding the railways only two smaller sections have been defunct:

* 1955: Leinfelden–Musberg–Waldenbuch (Siebenmühlentalbahn, 11.7 km)
* 1982: Kirchheim Süd–Holzmaden–Weilheim (7.7 km)

In the year 2000 the SSB opened the light rail Stuttgart–Nellingen.

Responsible for the public transport is the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart (VVS).

==== Individual transport ====
From west to east the Bundesautobahn 8, connecting Stuttgart and Ulm, is running through the district area. The most important Bundesstraßen are the B 10 Stuttgart–Ulm, the B 27 Stuttgart–Tübingen, the B 312 Flughafen–Reutlingen and the B 313 Plochingen–Reutlingen.

<text>Saturnian meter or verse is an old Latin and Italic poetic form, of which the principles of versification have become obscure. Only 132 complete uncontroversial verses survive. 95 literary verses and partial fragments have been preserved as quotations in later grammatical writings, as well as 37 verses in funerary or dedicatory inscriptions. The majority of literary Saturnians come from the &quot;Odysseia&quot; (more commonly known as the &quot;Odissia&quot; or &quot;Odyssia&quot;), a translation/paraphrase of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Livius Andronicus (c. 3rd century BC), and the &quot;Bellum Poenicum&quot;, an epic on the First Punic War by Gnaeus Naevius (c. 3rd century BC).

The meter was moribund by the time of the literary verses and forgotten altogether by classical times, falling out of use with the adoption of the hexameter and other Greek verse forms. Quintus Ennius is the poet who is generally credited with introducing the Greek hexameter in Latin, and dramatic meters seem to have been well on their way to domestic adoption in the works of his approximate contemporary Plautus. These Greek verse forms were considered more sophisticated than the native tradition; Horace called the Saturnian &quot;horridus&quot;. Consequently, the poetry in this meter was not preserved. Cicero regretted the loss in his &quot;Brutus&quot;:

:&quot;Atque utinam exstārent illa carmina, quae multīs saeclīs ante suam aetātem in epulīs esse cantitāta ā singulīs conuīuīs dē clārōrum uirōrum laudibus in &quot;Orīginibus&quot; scrīptum relīquit Catō.&quot;

::&#x27;I heartily wish those venerable Odes were still extant, which Cato informs us in his &quot;Antiquities&quot;, used to be sung by every guest in his turn at the homely feasts of our ancestors, many ages before, to commemorate the feats of their heroes.&#x27;

However, it has been noted that later poets like Ennius (by extension Virgil, who follows him in both time and technique) preserve something of the Saturnian aesthetic in hexameter verse. Ennius explicitly acknowledges Naevius&#x27; poem and skill (lines 206–7 and 208–9 in the edition of Skutsch, with translations by Goldberg):

:[...] &quot;scrīpsēre aliī rem&quot;
:&quot;vorsibus quōs ōlim Faunei vātesque canēbant&quot;

::&#x27;[...] Others have given an account
::in rhythms which the Fauns and seers sang.&#x27;

:&quot;nam neque Mūsārum scopulōs ēscendit ad altōs&quot;
:&quot;nec dictī studiōsus fuit Rōmānus homō ante hunc.&quot;

::&#x27;For no Roman scaled the Muses&#x27; lofty crags
::or was careful with his speech before this man.&#x27;

Ancient grammarians sought to derive the verse from a Greek model, in which syllable weight or the arrangement of light and heavy syllables was the governing principle. Scholars today remain divided between two approaches:

# The meter was quantitative (but not borrowed from Greek).
# The meter was accentual or based on accented and unaccented syllables.

Despite the division, there is some consensus regarding aspects of the verse&#x27;s structure. A Saturnian line can be divided into two cola or half-lines, separated by a central caesura. The second colon is shorter than or as long as the first. Furthermore, in any half-line with seven or more syllables, the last three or four are preceded by word-end. This is known as Korsch&#x27;s caesura or the &quot;caesura Korschiana&quot;, after its discoverer.

==The Saturnian as quantitative==

Most—but not all—Saturnians can be captured by the following scheme:

* ∪ = light syllable
* – = heavy syllable
* ∪∪ = two light syllables that occupy the space of one heavy
* || = caesura
* ∪ over – (x at verse-end) = position can be occupied by either light or heavy syllable
* ∪∪ over – over ∪ = position can be occupied by any of the three

===Examples===

Numeration of literary fragments is according to Warmington&#x27;s edition; translations are also by Warmington (see bibliography infra).

(1) Livius Andronicus, &quot;Odissia&quot; fragment 1

::&quot;Virum mihī Camēna īnsece versūtum&quot;
:::∪ – ∪ – || ∪ – ∪ || – ∪ ∪ – – x
:::&#x27;Tell me, O Goddess of song, of the clever man&#x27;

(2) Naevius, &quot;Bellum Poenicum&quot; fragments 2–4

::&quot;Postquam avem aspexit in templō Anchīsa&quot;
::&quot;sacr(ā) in mēnsā Penātium ordine pōnuntur&quot;
::&quot;immolābat auream victimam pulchram&quot;

:::– ∪ ∪ ∪ || – – ∪ || – – – – – x
:::∪ – – – || ∪ – (∪) – || – ∪ – – – x
:::– ∪ – – || – ∪ – || – ∪ – – x

:::&#x27;After Anchises had seen a bird within the range of view,
:::hallowed offerings were set in a row on the table of the Household Gods;
:::and he busied himself in sacrificing a beautiful golden victim.&#x27;

(3) Epitaph for Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus (c. 270–150 BC)

::::† This syllable is historically –.

:::&#x27;Sprung from Gnaeus his father, a man strong and wise,
:::whose appearance was most in keeping with his virtue,
:::who was consul, censor, and aedile among you,
:::he captured Taurasia, Cisauna, Samnium,
:::he subdued all Lucania and led off hostages.&#x27;

==The Saturnian as accentual==

W.M. Lindsay formalizes the accentual scheme of the Saturnian as follows:

* ´ = accented syllable
* ∪ = unaccented

Handbooks otherwise schematize the verse as 3+ || 2+ stresses. This theory assumes Classical Latin accentuation. However, there is reason to believe that the Old Latin accent may have played a role in the verse. Afterwards, Lindsay himself abandoned his theory.

==The Saturnian in non-Latin Italic==

Despite the obscurity of the principles of Saturnian versification in Latin, scholars have nonetheless attempted to extend analysis to other languages of ancient Italy related to Latin.

(7) Faliscan (two nearly identical inscriptions on cups from Civita Castellana, 4th century BC)

::FOIED•VINO•(PI)PAFO•CRA•CAREFO

:::In Latin orthography:

::::&quot;foiēd vīnom (pi)pafō. crā(s) carēfō.&quot;

:::– – – – (||) ∪ (∪) – || – ∪ – x (Quantitative)
:::´ ∪ ´ ∪ (||) ´ (∪) ∪ || ´ ∪ ´ ∪ (Accentual)

:::&#x27;Today, I shall drink wine. Tomorrow, I shall go without.&#x27;

(8) Oscan (one of several similar inscriptions in Etruscoid script on vessels from Teano, 3rd century BC)

::minis:beriis:anei:upsatuh:sent:tiianei*

::::* Sabellian inscriptional texts in native orthography are conventionally transcribed in bold-face minuscule, and those in the Latin script italicized.

:::In Latin orthography:

::::&quot;Minis Beris ā(n)nei opsātō sent Teānei.&quot;

:::(scansion of first three words uncertain) || – – – – || ∪ – x (Quantitative)
:::´ ∪ ´ ∪ ´ ∪ || ∪ – ∪ – || ∪ – ∪ (Accentual)

:::&#x27; (these) were made at Teanum in Minius Berius&#x27; (workshop?).&#x27; (meaning of anei uncertain)

(9) Umbrian (inscription on a bronze plate from Plestia, 4th century BC)

::cupras matres pletinas sacrụ [esu]**

::::** In epigraphy, graphemes transcribed with an underdot are of uncertain reading, and restorations are enclosed in square brackets.

:::In Latin orthography:

::::&quot;Cuprās Mātris Plestīnās sacrum esum.&quot;

:::∪ – – – || – – – || ∪ ∪ ∪ x (Quantitative)
:::´ ∪ ´ ∪ || ∪ ´ ∪ || ´ ∪ ´ ∪ (Accentual)

:::&#x27;I am a sacred object of Mother Cupra from Plestia.&#x27; (Cupra was a Sabine goddess)

(10) Paelignian (final verse in an inscription on a stone from Corfinium, 1st century BC)

::&quot;lifar dida vus deti hanustu herentas&quot;

:::In Latin orthography:

::::&quot;Līfar dida(t) vūs deti hanustō herentās.&quot;

:::– – ∪ – || – (scansion of &quot;deti&quot; uncertain) || ∪ – – ∪ – x (Quantitative)
:::´ ∪ ´ ∪ || ´ ´ ∪ || ∪ ´ ∪ ∪ ´ ∪ (Accentual)

:::&#x27;May Liber grant you ... (good?) will ...&#x27; (meanings of &quot;deti&quot; and &quot;hanustu&quot; unknown)

==Prehistory of the Saturnian==

A large number of the verses have a 4 || 3 || 3 || 3 syllable count and division, which scholars have been inclined to take as underlying or ideal. This has permitted comparison with meters from related Indo-European poetic traditions outside Italic, such as Celtic, and a few scholars have tried to trace the verse back to Proto-Indo-European. John Vigorita derived the 4 || 3 || 5-6 syllable Saturnian from:

a Proto-Indo-European 7- or 8-syllable line combined with a shorter 5- or 6-syllable line, which is itself derivable from the octosyllable by undoing truncations (noted in metrical schemes by one or more ^&#x27;s, wherever in the meter the truncation has occurred).

M.L. West schematized this subset of verses as:

which he then traces to two Proto-Indo-European octosyllables:

one giving the Saturnian&#x27;s heptasyllabic half-line by acephaly (truncation of line-beginning), the other yielding the hexasyllabic colon both by acephaly and catalexis (truncation of line-end). Ultimately, owing to the difficulties of describing and analyzing the Saturnian without taking its history into account, attempts at reconstruction have not won acceptance.

==References==
==Sources==
::&quot;In English, two collections of the texts are available. Warmington&#x27;s Loeb contains Livius Andronicus and Naevius&#x27; Saturnians, among other poetry and poets, and Courtney&#x27;s anthology with commentary includes the Scipionic epitaphs and other inscriptions. Regarding the meter, the standard quantitative treatment is still Cole. The details of the accentual approach are set out in Lindsay. A new proposal that draws from generative linguistics has recently been put forward by Parsons (currently under follow-up investigation by Angelo Mercado, whose analysis is available at ref.).&quot;

::&quot;No recent treatment of non-Latin Italic material is available in English; see Costa, Morelli, and Poccetti. Vigorita and West discuss the Saturnian and its prehistory in connection with the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European meter. Goldberg&#x27;s book is an excellent treatment of the development of Roman epic from Livius Andronicus to Ennius to Virgil. The standard edition of Ennius&#x27; &quot;Annales&quot; is that of Skutsch. See also Whitman for a comparative study of Old Latin and Old English meter (he argues for alliteration and accent as definitive for both).&quot;

<text>In algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, the Zariski topology is a topology defined on geometric objects called varieties. It is very different from topologies that are commonly used in real or complex analysis; in particular, it is not Hausdorff. This topology was introduced primarily by Oscar Zariski and later generalized for making the set of prime ideals of a commutative ring (called the spectrum of the ring) a topological space.

The Zariski topology allows tools from topology to be used to study algebraic varieties, even when the underlying field is not a topological field. This is one of the basic ideas of scheme theory, which allows one to build general algebraic varieties by gluing together affine varieties in a way similar to that in manifold theory, where manifolds are built by gluing together charts, which are open subsets of real affine spaces.

The Zariski topology of an algebraic variety is the topology whose closed sets are the algebraic subsets of the variety. In the case of an algebraic variety over the complex numbers, the Zariski topology is thus coarser than the usual topology, as every algebraic set is closed for the usual topology.

The generalization of the Zariski topology to the set of prime ideals of a commutative ring follows from Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, that establishes a bijective correspondence between the points of an affine variety defined over an algebraically closed field and the maximal ideals of the ring of its regular functions. This suggests defining the Zariski topology on the set of the maximal ideals of a commutative ring as the topology such that a set of maximal ideals is closed if and only if it is the set of all maximal ideals that contain a given ideal. Another basic idea of Grothendieck&#x27;s scheme theory is to consider as &quot;points&quot;, not only the usual points corresponding to maximal ideals, but also all (irreducible) algebraic varieties, which correspond to prime ideals. Thus the Zariski topology on the set of prime ideals (spectrum) of a commutative ring is the topology such that a set of prime ideals is closed if and only if it is the set of all prime ideals that contain a fixed ideal.

==Zariski topology of varieties==
In classical algebraic geometry (that is, the part of algebraic geometry in which one does not use schemes, which were introduced by Grothendieck around 1960), the Zariski topology is defined on algebraic varieties. The Zariski topology, defined on the points of the variety, is the topology such that the closed sets are the algebraic subsets of the variety. As the most elementary algebraic varieties are affine and projective varieties, it is useful to make this definition more explicit in both cases. We assume that we are working over a fixed, algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot; (in classical algebraic geometry, &quot;k&quot; is usually the field of complex numbers).

===Affine varieties===
First, we define the topology on the affine space formula_1 formed by the -tuples of elements of . The topology is defined by specifying its closed sets, rather than its open sets, and these are taken simply to be all the algebraic sets in formula_2 That is, the closed sets are those of the form
formula_3
where &quot;S&quot; is any set of polynomials in &quot;n&quot; variables over &quot;k&quot;. It is a straightforward verification to show that:

* &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) = &quot;V&quot;((&quot;S&quot;)), where (&quot;S&quot;) is the ideal generated by the elements of &quot;S&quot;;
* For any two ideals of polynomials &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, we have
*# formula_4
*# formula_5

It follows that finite unions and arbitrary intersections of the sets &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) are also of this form, so that these sets form the closed sets of a topology (equivalently, their complements, denoted &quot;D&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) and called &quot;principal open sets&quot;, form the topology itself). This is the Zariski topology on formula_2

If &quot;X&quot; is an affine algebraic set (irreducible or not) then the Zariski topology on it is defined simply to be the subspace topology induced by its inclusion into some formula_2 Equivalently, it can be checked that:

* The elements of the affine coordinate ring formula_8 act as functions on &quot;X&quot; just as the elements of formula_9 act as functions on formula_10; here, &quot;I&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the ideal of all polynomials vanishing on &quot;X&quot;. 
* For any set of polynomials &quot;S&quot;, let &quot;T&quot; be the set of their images in &quot;A&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). Then the subset of &quot;X&quot; formula_11 (these notations are not standard) is equal to the intersection with &quot;X&quot; of &quot;V(S)&quot;.

This establishes that the above equation, clearly a generalization of the definition of the closed sets in formula_10 above, defines the Zariski topology on any affine variety.

===Projective varieties===
Recall that &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space formula_13 is defined to be the set of equivalence classes of non-zero points in formula_14 by identifying two points that differ by a scalar multiple in &quot;k&quot;. The elements of the polynomial ring formula_15 are not generally functions on formula_13 because any point has many representatives that yield different values in a polynomial; however, for homogeneous polynomials the condition of having zero or nonzero value on any given projective point is well-defined since the scalar multiple factors out of the polynomial. Therefore, if &quot;S&quot; is any set of homogeneous polynomials we may reasonably speak of

:formula_17

The same facts as above may be established for these sets, except that the word &quot;ideal&quot; must be replaced by the phrase &quot;homogeneous ideal&quot;, so that the &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), for sets &quot;S&quot; of homogeneous polynomials, define a topology on formula_18 As above the complements of these sets are denoted &quot;D&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), or, if confusion is likely to result, &quot;&quot;(&quot;S&quot;).

The projective Zariski topology is defined for projective algebraic sets just as the affine one is defined for affine algebraic sets, by taking the subspace topology. Similarly, it may be shown that this topology is defined intrinsically by sets of elements of the projective coordinate ring, by the same formula as above.

===Properties===

An important property of Zariski topologies is that they have a base consisting of simple elements, namely the for individual polynomials (or for projective varieties, homogeneous polynomials) . That these form a basis follows from the formula for the intersection of two Zariski-closed sets given above (apply it repeatedly to the principal ideals generated by the generators of ). The open sets in this base are called &quot;distinguished&quot; or &quot;basic&quot; open sets. The importance of this property results in particular from its use in the definition of an affine scheme.

By Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem and the fact that Noetherian rings are closed under quotients, every affine or projective coordinate ring is Noetherian. As a consequence, affine or projective spaces with the Zariski topology are Noetherian topological spaces, which implies that any closed subset of these spaces is compact.

However, except for finite algebraic sets, no algebraic set is ever a Hausdorff space. In the old topological literature &quot;compact&quot; was taken to include the Hausdorff property, and this convention is still honored in algebraic geometry; therefore compactness in the modern sense is called &quot;quasicompactness&quot; in algebraic geometry. However, since every point (&quot;a1&quot;, ..., &quot;an&quot;) is the zero set of the polynomials &quot;x1&quot; - &quot;a1&quot;, ..., &quot;xn&quot; - &quot;an&quot;, points are closed and so every variety satisfies the T1 axiom.

Every regular map of varieties is continuous in the Zariski topology. In fact, the Zariski topology is the weakest topology (with the fewest open sets) in which this is true and in which points are closed. This is easily verified by noting that the Zariski-closed sets are simply the intersections of the inverse images of 0 by the polynomial functions, considered as regular maps into formula_19

==Spectrum of a ring==
In modern algebraic geometry, an algebraic variety is often represented by its associated scheme, which is a topological space (equipped with additional structures) that is locally homeomorphic to the spectrum of a ring. The &quot;spectrum of a commutative ring&quot; &quot;A&quot;, denoted , is the set of the prime ideals of &quot;A&quot;, equipped with the Zariski topology, for which the closed sets are the sets

:formula_20

where &quot;I&quot; is an ideal.

To see the connection with the classical picture, note that for any set &quot;S&quot; of polynomials (over an algebraically closed field), it follows from Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz that the points of &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) (in the old sense) are exactly the tuples (&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;an&quot;) such that the ideal generated by the polynomials &quot;x&quot;1 − &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;xn&quot; − &quot;an&quot; contains &quot;S&quot;; moreover, these are maximal ideals and by the &quot;weak&quot; Nullstellensatz, an ideal of any affine coordinate ring is maximal if and only if it is of this form. Thus, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is &quot;the same as&quot; the maximal ideals containing &quot;S&quot;. Grothendieck&#x27;s innovation in defining Spec was to replace maximal ideals with all prime ideals; in this formulation it is natural to simply generalize this observation to the definition of a closed set in the spectrum of a ring.

Another way, perhaps more similar to the original, to interpret the modern definition is to realize that the elements of &quot;A&quot; can actually be thought of as functions on the prime ideals of &quot;A&quot;; namely, as functions on Spec &quot;A&quot;. Simply, any prime ideal &quot;P&quot; has a corresponding residue field, which is the field of fractions of the quotient &quot;A&quot;/&quot;P&quot;, and any element of &quot;A&quot; has a reflection in this residue field. Furthermore, the elements that are actually in &quot;P&quot; are precisely those whose reflection vanishes at &quot;P&quot;. So if we think of the map, associated to any element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_21

(&quot;evaluation of &quot;a&quot;&quot;), which assigns to each point its reflection in the residue field there, as a function on Spec &quot;A&quot; (whose values, admittedly, lie in different fields at different points), then we have

:formula_22

More generally, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;I&quot;) for any ideal &quot;I&quot; is the common set on which all the &quot;functions&quot; in &quot;I&quot; vanish, which is formally similar to the classical definition. In fact, they agree in the sense that when &quot;A&quot; is the ring of polynomials over some algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;, the maximal ideals of &quot;A&quot; are (as discussed in the previous paragraph) identified with &quot;n&quot;-tuples of elements of &quot;k&quot;, their residue fields are just &quot;k&quot;, and the &quot;evaluation&quot; maps are actually evaluation of polynomials at the corresponding &quot;n&quot;-tuples. Since as shown above, the classical definition is essentially the modern definition with only maximal ideals considered, this shows that the interpretation of the modern definition as &quot;zero sets of functions&quot; agrees with the classical definition where they both make sense.

Just as Spec replaces affine varieties, the Proj construction replaces projective varieties in modern algebraic geometry. Just as in the classical case, to move from the affine to the projective definition we need only replace &quot;ideal&quot; by &quot;homogeneous ideal&quot;, though there is a complication involving the &quot;irrelevant maximal ideal&quot;, which is discussed in the cited article.

===Examples===

* Spec &quot;k&quot;, the spectrum of a field &quot;k&quot; is the topological space with one element.
* Spec formula_23, the spectrum of the integers has a closed point for every prime number &quot;p&quot; corresponding to the maximal ideal formula_24, and one non-closed generic point (i.e., whose closure is the whole space) corresponding to the zero ideal (0). So the closed subsets of Spec formula_25 are precisely the whole space and the finite unions of closed points. 
* Spec &quot;k&quot;[&quot;t&quot;], the spectrum of the polynomial ring over a field &quot;k&quot;: such a polynomial ring is known to be a principal ideal domain and the irreducible polynomials are the prime elements of &quot;k&quot;[&quot;t&quot;]. If &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed, for example the field of complex numbers, a non-constant polynomial is irreducible if and only if it is linear, of the form &quot;t&quot; − &quot;a&quot;, for some element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;k&quot;. So, the spectrum consists of one closed point for every element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;k&quot; and a generic point, corresponding to the zero ideal, and the set of the closed points is homeomorphic with the affine line &quot;k&quot; equipped with its Zariski topology. Because of this homeomorphism, some authors use the term &quot;affine line&quot; for the spectrum of &quot;k&quot;[&quot;t&quot;]. If &quot;k&quot; is not algebraically closed, for example the field of the real numbers, the picture becomes more complicated because of the existence of non-linear irreducible polynomials. In this case, the spectrum consists of one closed point for each monic irreducible polynomial, and a generic point corresponding to the zero ideal. For example, the spectrum of formula_26 consists of the closed points (&quot;x&quot; − &quot;a&quot;), for &quot;a&quot; in formula_27, the closed points (&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;px&quot; + &quot;q&quot;) where &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; are in formula_27 and with negative discriminant &quot;p&quot;2 − 4&quot;q&quot; &lt; 0, and finally a generic point (0). For any field, the closed subsets of Spec &quot;k&quot;[&quot;t&quot;] are finite unions of closed points, and the whole space. (This results from the fact that &quot;k&quot;[&quot;t&quot;] is a principal ideal domain, and, in a principal ideal domain, the prime ideals that contain an ideal are the prime factors of the prime factorization of a generator of the ideal).

===Further properties===

The most dramatic change in the topology from the classical picture to the new is that points are no longer necessarily closed; by expanding the definition, Grothendieck introduced generic points, which are the points with maximal closure, that is the minimal prime ideals. The closed points correspond to maximal ideals of &quot;A&quot;. However, the spectrum and projective spectrum are still T0 spaces: given two points &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; that are prime ideals of &quot;A&quot;, at least one of them, say &quot;P&quot;, does not contain the other. Then &quot;D&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;) contains &quot;P&quot; but, of course, not &quot;Q&quot;.

Just as in classical algebraic geometry, any spectrum or projective spectrum is (quasi)compact, and if the ring in question is Noetherian then the space is a Noetherian topological space. However, these facts are counterintuitive: we do not normally expect open sets, other than connected components, to be compact, and for affine varieties (for example, Euclidean space) we do not even expect the space itself to be compact. This is one instance of the geometric unsuitability of the Zariski topology. Grothendieck solved this problem by defining the notion of properness of a scheme (actually, of a morphism of schemes), which recovers the intuitive idea of compactness: Proj is proper, but Spec is not.

<doc id="241745" wikidata="Q156914" url="?curid=241745" title="Dievs, svētī Latviju!">
<text>&quot;&quot; is the national anthem of Latvia. Created in 1873 as a patriotic song, it did not gain official status until 1920.

== History ==
The music and lyrics were written in 1873 by Kārlis Baumanis, a teacher who was part of the Young Latvian nationalist movement. It is thought that Baumanis was inspired by a popular song &quot;Dievs, svētī Kurzemi/Vidzemi&quot; (, which was modified depending on the region it was used in) that was sung to the tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot;. Baumanis&#x27;s lyrics were different from the modern ones: he used the term &quot;Baltics&quot; synonymously and interchangeably with &quot;Latvia&quot; and &quot;Latvians&quot;, so &quot;Latvia&quot; was actually mentioned only at the beginning of the first verse. Later, the term &quot;Latvia&quot; was removed and replaced with &quot;Baltics&quot; to avoid a ban on the song. This has led to the misapprehension that the term &quot;Latvia&quot; was not part of the song until it was chosen as national anthem on June 7, 1920, and the word &quot;Baltics&quot; was replaced with &quot;Latvia&quot;.

During the occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union, the singing of &quot;Dievs, svētī Latviju&quot; was banned. The subsequently-established Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic had its own anthem. &quot;Dievs, svētī Latviju&quot; was restored as the state anthem of Latvia on February 15, 1990 – shortly before independence on May 4.

==Performance==
The anthem&#x27;s tune was modernized with a new F-major version that has been used since 2014; formerly, a G-major version was used on LTV&#x27;s sign-on and sign-offs daily from 2011 to 2013. However, the G-major version was still played on any occasion (especially and notably, during times of mourning). The current version played on LTV for their sign-on and sign-offs daily is in the key of B-flat major.

<text>A bearer bond or bearer note is a bond or debt security issued by a government or a business entity such as a corporation. As a bearer instrument, it differs from the more common types of investment securities in that it is unregistered—no records are kept of the owner, or the transactions involving ownership. Whoever physically holds the paper on which the bond is issued is the presumptive owner of the instrument. This is useful for investors who wish to remain anonymous. 

Recovery of the value of a bearer bond in the event of its loss, theft, or destruction is usually impossible. Some relief is possible in the case of United States public debt. Furthermore, while all bond types state maturity dates and interest rates, bearer bond coupons for interest payments are physically attached to the security and must be submitted to an authorized agent in order to receive payment. 

Issuance of new bearer bonds has been effectively outlawed in the United States since the 1980s due to their use in illegal activities, but bearer bonds issued before this date can be redeemed if the issuer still exists.

== History ==
Bearer bonds have been traced back as far as 1648, but there was a spike in popularity in the United States for these bonds during the Civil War, as government resources were strained and limited. Following the success and ease of transferring funds in the United States, Europe and South America also started issuing this type of bond.

The main appeal of bearer bonds is anonymity, which led them to become the financial instrument of choice for unlawful activity including money laundering, tax evasion and drug trafficking. In response, new issuances of bearer bonds have been severely curtailed in the United States since 1982.

All bearer bonds issued by the US Treasury had matured as of May 2016, with approximately $87 million yet to be redeemed as of March 2020.

=== Chiasso financial smuggling case ===
From 2009 to 2012, a series of incidents involving the forgery and smuggling of U.S. bearer bonds in Italy and Switzerland occurred, beginning with the Chiasso financial smuggling case in June 2009, in which Italian financial police and customs guards seized documents purporting to be U.S. bearer bonds totaling $134.5 billion in Chiasso, Switzerland, on the Italian border. 

The bonds were readily determined to be phony: the latest in a series of &quot;billion-dollar bond&quot; schemes that the United States Treasury calls &quot;Morganthaus&quot;.

== United States policy and practice ==
In the United States, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 substantially curtailed the issue of debt in bearer form: it also disallowed any tax deduction of interest paid on any such bonds issued after 1982 by the issuer in the case of corporate bonds and removed the tax exemption of the interest paid in the case of municipal bonds, with registered bonds retaining the tax-exempt treatment. 

A challenge to this tax treatment by the US state of South Carolina was heard by the US Supreme Court in the case of &quot;South Carolina v. Baker&quot; (1988), which upheld the law and brought to an end the further issue of virtually all US municipal bearer bonds.

<doc id="241749" wikidata="Q133011" url="?curid=241749" title="Latvian lats">
<text>The Latvian lats (plural: &quot;lati&quot;, plural genitive: &quot;latu&quot;, second Latvian lats ISO 4217 currency code: LVL) was the currency of Latvia from 1922 until 1940 and from 1993 until it was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2014. A two-week transition period during which the lats was in circulation alongside the euro ended on 14 January 2014. The lats is abbreviated as &quot;Ls&quot; and was subdivided into 100 &quot;santīmi&quot; (singular: &quot;santīms&quot;; from French &quot;centime&quot;), abbreviated as an &quot;s&quot; after the santīm amount.

The Latvian lats has been recognized as one of the 99 entries of the Latvian Culture Canon.

==First lats, 1922–1940==
The first lats (symbol: ℒ︁𝓈) was first introduced on 3 August 1922, replacing the first Latvian ruble at a rate of ℒ︁𝓈 1 = Rbls 50. The lats was pegged against the gold standard from its introduction until 28 September 1936, when it was pegged against the British pound sterling at a rate of 1 £ = 25,22 ℒ︁𝓈. However, as the pound still retained the standard, a link of sorts existed until 1940.

On 17 June 1940, Latvia was occupied by the USSR. After the dismantling of the Bank of Latvia and its replacement with the Latvia Republican Office of the Gosbank on 10 October, the Soviet ruble was introduced alongside the lats on 25 November 1940 at par, although the real monetary value of the ruble was about a third of the lats. Thus both wages and prices were gradually raised to devalue the lats from June to November 1940. To lessen the effect of the exodus of goods sent by Soviet occupational personnel to the USSR, taking advantage of the new exchange rate, buyer limits for various goods were introduced.

Although the Soviet authorities initially pledged not to abolish the lats, it was taken out of circulation without prior warning at 13:05 on 25 March 1941, simultaneously nationalising all deposits larger than ℒ︁𝓈 1000. A part of the Latvian gold, silver and currency reserves were sent to Moscow at the start of the occupation.

===Coins===
Coins were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 santīmu, ℒ︁𝓈 1, ℒ︁𝓈 2 and ℒ︁𝓈 5. The 1s, 2s and 5s were in bronze (Cu, Sn, Zn), the 10s, 20s and 50s were nickel, while coins of ℒ︁𝓈 1 and above were struck in silver, with a purity of 83,5 percent.

===Banknotes===
The Latvian Bank issued notes from 1922 in denominations of ℒ︁𝓈 20, ℒ︁𝓈 25, ℒ︁𝓈 50, ℒ︁𝓈 100 and ℒ︁𝓈 500. They also issued ℒ︁𝓈 10 notes which were 500 ruble notes overprinted with the new denomination. The government issued currency notes from 1925 in denominations of ℒ︁𝓈 5, ℒ︁𝓈 10 and ℒ︁𝓈 20.
== Second lats, 1993–2013 ==

The lats was reintroduced on 5 March 1993, replacing the Latvian ruble, which continued to circulate and kept validity until and including 30 June 1994 at a rate of LR 200 being equivalent to Ls 1. The Ls 5 banknote was introduced first, and the last banknote to be introduced was the Ls 500 banknote on 20 July 1998. The lats was replaced on 1 January 2014 by the euro, at the rate of Ls 0.702804 to €1. The second lats can be exchanged to euros at the official rate at the Bank of Latvia&#x27;s cashier&#x27;s office in Riga.

Until the end of its circulation in January 2014, the lats was the fourth highest-valued currency unit per face value, after the Kuwaiti dinar, Bahraini dinar, and the Omani rial. The Ls 500 note was the world&#x27;s third most valuable banknote after the $10,000 Brunei/Singaporean dollar note and the 1,000 Swiss franc note. With the abolition of the Maltese lira on 1 January 2008, the lats became the most valued European currency.

===Coins===
Coins were issued in denominations of 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 20s and 50s, Ls 1 and Ls 2. Besides standard coins in the list below and coins for collectors, the following coins were also issued: three commemorative circulation coins were issued in denominations of Ls 2, Ls 10 and Ls 100 (the latter two of which were, respectively, silver and gold), a Ls 100 gold bullion coin, and a series of limited design Ls1 coins twice a year from 2004 to 2013, and once in 2001 and 2003.

The initial standard Ls 2 coin was issued only once in 1992, it was a copper-nickel coin of 6g and measured 24.35mm in diameter. It was gradually replaced in circulation from 1999 with the below bimetallic coin due to counterfeiting issues.

The standard coins were designed by Gunārs Lūsis and Jānis Strupulis.

===Banknotes===
All banknotes are 130 × 65 mm in size. They were printed by Giesecke &amp; Devrient GmbH in Germany and were designed by Imants Žodžiks and Valdis Ošiņš.

<doc id="241758" wikidata="Q532375" url="?curid=241758" title="Charles Grandison Finney">
<text>Charles Grandison Finney (August 29, 1792 – August 16, 1875) was a controversial American Presbyterian minister and leader in the Second Great Awakening in the United States. He has been called the &quot;Father of Old Revivalism&quot;. Finney rejected much of traditional Reformed theology.

Finney was best known as a passionate revivalist preacher from 1825 to 1835 in the Burned-over District in Upstate New York and Manhattan, an opponent of Old School Presbyterian theology, an advocate of Christian perfectionism, and a religious writer.

His religious views led him, together with several other evangelical leaders, to promote social reforms, such as abolitionism and equal education for women and African Americans. From 1835 he taught at Oberlin College of Ohio, which accepted students without regard to race or sex. He served as its second president from 1851 to 1865, and its faculty and students were activists for abolitionism, the Underground Railroad, and universal education.

== Early life ==
Born in Warren, Connecticut, on August 29, 1792, Finney was the youngest of nine children. The son of farmers who moved to the upstate frontier of Jefferson County, New York, after the American Revolutionary War, Finney never attended college. His leadership abilities, musical skill, height, and piercing eyes gained him recognition in his community. He and his family attended the Baptist church in Henderson, New York, where the preacher led emotional, revival-style meetings. The Baptists and the Methodists displayed fervor in the early 19th century. He &quot;read the law&quot;, studying as an apprentice to become a lawyer under Benjamin Wright. In Adams, New York, he entered the congregation of George Washington Gale and became the director of the church choir. After a dramatic conversion experience and baptism into the Holy Spirit he gave up legal practice to preach the Gospel.
As a young man, Finney was a Master Mason, but after his conversion, he left the group as antithetical to Christianity and was active in anti-Masonic movements.

In 1821, Finney started studies at 29 under George Washington Gale, to become a licensed minister in the Presbyterian Church. Like his teacher Gale, he took a commission for six months of a Female Missionary Society, located in Oneida County. &quot;I went into the northern part of Jefferson County and began my labors at Evans&#x27; Mills, in the town of Le Ray.&quot; 

When Gale moved to a farm in Western, Oneida County, New York, Finney accompanied him and, along with Theodore Dwight Weld, worked on Gale&#x27;s farm in exchange for instruction, a forerunner of Gale&#x27;s Oneida Institute. He had many misgivings about the fundamental doctrines taught in Presbyterianism. He moved to New York City in 1832, where he was minister of the Chatham Street Chapel and took the breathtaking step of barring all slave owners and traders from Communion. Since the Chatham Street Chapel was not a church but a theater &quot;fitted up&quot; to serve as a church, a new Broadway Tabernacle was built for him in 1836 that was &quot;the largest Protestant house of worship in the country.&quot; In 1835, he became the professor of systematic theology at the recently-created Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Oberlin, Ohio.

== Revivals ==
Finney was active as a revivalist from 1825 to 1835 in Jefferson County and for a few years in Manhattan. In 1830–1831, he led a revival in Rochester, New York, which has been noted as inspiring other revivals of the Second Great Awakening. A leading pastor in New York who was converted in the Rochester meetings gave the following account of the effects of Finney&#x27;s meetings in that city: &quot;The whole community was stirred. Religion was the topic of conversation in the house, in the shop, in the office and on the street. The only theater in the city was converted into a livery stable; the only circus into a soap and candle factory. Grog shops were closed; the Sabbath was honored; the sanctuaries were thronged with happy worshippers; a new impulse was given to every philanthropic enterprise; the fountains of benevolence were opened, and men lived to good.&quot;

Finney was known for his innovations in preaching and the conduct of religious meetings, which often impacted entire communities. Innovations included having women pray out loud in public meetings of mixed sexes, the introduction of the &quot;anxious seat&quot; in which those considering becoming Christians could sit to receive prayer, and public censure of individuals by name in sermons and prayers. He was also known for his extemporaneous preaching.

Finney &quot;had a deep insight into the almost interminable intricacies of human depravity... He poured the floods of gospel love upon the audience. He took short-cuts to men&#x27;s hearts, and his trip-hammer blows demolished the subterfuges of unbelief.&quot;

Disciples of Finney included Theodore Weld, John Humphrey Noyes, and Andrew Leete Stone.

== Abolitionism ==
In addition to becoming a widely popular Christian evangelist, Finney was involved with social reforms, particularly the abolitionist movement. Finney frequently denounced slavery from the pulpit, called it a &quot;great national sin,&quot; and refused Holy Communion to slaveholders.

== President of Oberlin College ==
In 1835, the wealthy silk merchant and benefactor Arthur Tappan (1786–1865) offered financial backing to the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute (as Oberlin College had been known until 1850), and he invited Finney, on the recommendation of abolitionist Theodore Dwight Weld (1803–1895), to establish its theological department. After much wrangling, Finney accepted on the conditions that he be allowed to continue to preach in New York, the school admit black people, and free speech be guaranteed at Oberlin. After more than a decade, he was selected as its second president, serving from 1851 to 1866. (He had already served as acting president in 1849.) Oberlin was the first American college to accept women and black people as students in addition to white men. From its early years, its faculty and students were active in the abolitionist movement. They participated together with people of the town in biracial efforts to help fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad and to resist the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Many slaves escaped to Ohio across the Ohio River from Kentucky, which made Ohio a critical area for their passage to freedom.

== Personal life ==
Finney was twice widowed and married three times. In 1824, he married Lydia Root Andrews (1804–1847) while he lived in Jefferson County. They had six children together. In 1848, a year after Lydia&#x27;s death, he married Elizabeth Ford Atkinson (1799–1863) in Ohio. In 1865, he married Rebecca Allen Rayl (1824–1907), also in Ohio. Each of Finney&#x27;s three wives accompanied him on his revival tours and joined him in his evangelistic efforts. He died in 1875 age 82.

Finney&#x27;s great-grandson, also named Charles Grandison Finney, became a famous author.

== Theology ==
Finney was a New School Presbyterian, and his theology was similar to that of Nathaniel William Taylor. Finney departed strongly from traditional Reformed theology. In the field of soteriology, he denied the doctrine of total depravity, implying humans can please God without the intervention of his grace. Some consider his stance as Pelagianism. Finney affirmed both the external and internal work of the Holy Spirit within the context of salvation, though with the sole purpose of motivation. This is why some others call his stance &quot;soft semi-Pelagianism&quot;, although recognizing its mere Pelagian nature. 

Finney&#x27;s theory of atonement combines principles from different historical theories, notably the moral influence theory, but can&#x27;t be associated exclusively with either of them.

Finney was an advocate of perfectionism, the doctrine that through complete faith in Christ believers could receive a &quot;second blessing of the Holy Spirit&quot; and reach Christian perfection, a higher level of sanctification. For Finney, that meant living in obedience to God&#x27;s law and loving God and one&#x27;s neighbors but was not a sinless perfection. For Finney, even sanctified Christians are susceptible to temptation and capable of sin. Finney believed that it is possible for Christians to backslide, even to the point of losing their salvation.

A major theme of his preaching was the need for what he called conversion. He also focused on the responsibilities that converts had to dedicate themselves to disinterested benevolence and to work to build the kingdom of God on earth. He taught that preachers had vital roles in producing revival, and wrote in 1835, &quot;A revival is not a miracle, or dependent on a miracle, in any sense. It is a purely philosophical result of the right use of the constituted means.&quot;

Finney&#x27;s eschatology was postmillennial, meaning he believed the Millennium (a thousand-year reign of Christ on Earth) would begin before Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Finney believed Christians could bring in the Millennium by ridding the world of &quot;great and sore evils&quot;. Frances FitzGerald wrote, &quot;In his preaching the emphasis was always on the ability of men to choose their own salvation, to work for the general welfare, and to build a new society.&quot;

== Criticisms ==
Benjamin Warfield, a professor of theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, wrote, &quot;God might be eliminated from it [Finney&#x27;s theology] entirely without essentially changing its character.&quot; Albert Baldwin Dod, another Old School Presbyterian, reviewed Finney&#x27;s 1835 book &quot;Lectures on Revivals of Religion&quot;. He rejected it as theologically unsound. Dod was a defender of Reformed orthodoxy and was especially critical of Finney&#x27;s view of the doctrine of total depravity.

== In popular culture ==
In Charles W. Chesnutt&#x27;s short story &quot;The Passing of Grandison&quot; (1899), published in the collection &quot;The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color Line&quot;, the enslaved hero is named &quot;Grandison&quot;, likely an allusion to the well-known abolitionist.

The Charles Finney School was established in Rochester, New York, in 1992.

Finney is included as a political figure in the video game &quot;Victoria 3&quot;.

<text>Charles Marie Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy (16 December 1847 – 21 May 1923) was an officer in the French Army from 1870 to 1898. He gained notoriety as a spy for the German Empire and the actual perpetrator of the act of treason of which Captain Alfred Dreyfus was wrongfully accused and convicted in 1894.

After evidence against Esterhazy was discovered and made public, he was eventually subjected to a closed military trial in 1898, only to be officially found not guilty. Esterhazy retired from the military with the rank of major in 1898—presumably under pressure—and fled by way of Brussels to the United Kingdom, where he lived in the town of Harpenden in Hertfordshire until his death in 1923.

==Biography==

===Ancestry===
Charles Marie Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy was born in Paris, France, the son of General Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy (1807–1857), who later distinguished himself as division commander in the Crimean War. 
His paternal grandfather, Jean Marie Auguste Walsin-Esterhazy, born in 1767 at Valleraugue, was the illegitimate son of Countess Marie Anne Esterhazy de Galántha (1741–1823), by her affair with Jean André César de Ginestous (1725–1810), governor of Le Vigan (Gard).

Jean Marie was adopted by Dr Walsin, a French doctor in the service of the Esterházy princely family. Growing up under the name of Jean Marie Auguste Walsin, he became a business man and landowner in Nîmes, and added the name of Esterházy, apparently without the agreement of the family, after being acknowledged by his mother about 1797. This branch of the Esterházys had settled in France at the end of the 17th century and provided military officers to France, namely in its hussar regiments.

===Early life and military career===
Charles Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy was left an orphan in September 1857, aged only nine. After some schooling at the Lycée Bonaparte in Paris, he attempted in vain to enter the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. He disappears from public records in 1865; by 1869 he had been enlisted in the Legion of Antibes, a unit of French volunteers in the service of Pope Pius IX.

===Franco-Prussian War===
In June 1870, his uncle&#x27;s influence enabled Esterhazy to be commissioned into the French Foreign Legion. It was an irregular appointment as he had neither been promoted from the ranks after service as a non-commissioned officer, nor graduated from a military academy. However, the start of the Franco-Prussian War in July precluded any action being taken against him. He then assumed the title of count, to which he was not entitled.

There being a dearth of officers after the catastrophe of Sedan, Esterhazy was able to pass muster as a lieutenant and then as a captain. He served as an infantry officer in the campaigns of the Loire and of the Jura Mountains. After peace was declared, he remained in the army.

===Post-war career===

Between 1880 and 1882 Esterhazy was employed to translate German at the French military counter-intelligence section, where he became acquainted with Major Henry and Lieutenant Colonel Sandherr, both to become major figures in the Dreyfus affair. He was then employed at the French War Ministry. He never appeared in his regiment at Beauvais, and for about five years led a life of dissipation in Paris, as a result of which his small fortune was soon squandered.

In 1882 Esterhazy was attached to the expedition sent to Tunis. While there he was employed in the Intelligence Department, then in the Native Affairs Department of the regency. On his own initiative he inserted a citation within official records mention of his &quot;exploits in war&quot;, which was later recognised as being falsely concocted.

Returning to France in 1885, Esterhazy remained in garrison at Marseille for a long time. Having come to the end of his financial resources, he married in 1886, but he soon spent his wife&#x27;s dowry. In 1888 she demanded a separation.

In 1892, through the influence of General Félix Gustave Saussier, Esterhazy succeeded in getting a nomination as garrison-major in the Seventy-fourth Regiment of the line at Rouen. Being thus in the neighborhood of Paris, he resumed a life of speculation and excess. His inheritance squandered, Esterhazy had tried to retrieve his fortune in gambling-houses and on the stock-exchange; hard pressed by his creditors, he had recourse to extreme measures.

Having seconded André Crémieu-Foa in his duel with Édouard Drumont in 1892, Esterhazy claimed that this action had made his family, as well as his military seniors, quarrel with him. He produced false letters to support this allegation and threatened to kill both himself and his children. Through the medium of Zadoc Kahn, chief rabbi of France, Esterhazy obtained assistance from the Rothschild family (June 1894). At the same time, he was on good terms with the editors of the antisemitic newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;, which he supplied with information.

For an officer whose original commission had been irregular, Esterhazy&#x27;s military advancement had been unusually rapid: lieutenant in 1874, captain in 1880, decorated in 1882, major in 1892. The reports on him were generally excellent. Nevertheless, he considered himself wronged. In his letters he continually launched into recrimination and abuse against his chiefs. He made negative written comments on the French Army, and even France herself, for which he predicted and hoped that new disasters were in store.

===Dreyfus affair===

The Dreyfus affair was triggered in September 1894 when an office cleaner at the German embassy in Paris, who was also an agent of French military intelligence, passed on to her French contacts a handwritten memorandum (widely known as the &quot;bordereau&quot;), evidently written by an unnamed French officer, offering the German Embassy various confidential military documents.

Captain Alfred Dreyfus was picked by the army as the alleged traitor in October 1894. Among those who might have had access to some of the documents, suspicion seems to have fallen on Dreyfus mainly because he was a Jew. The official evidence against him depended overwhelmingly on the contention that his handwriting matched that on the &quot;bordereau&quot;. Convicted, he was cashiered (formally stripped of his military rank in a public ceremony of degradation), and then shipped to the penal colony of Devil&#x27;s Island (L&#x27;île du Diable) off the coast of French Guiana.

In 1896, Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Picquart, the then-new head of the Intelligence Service, uncovered a letter sent by Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen (at the time German military attache to Paris) to Esterhazy. After comparison of Esterhazy&#x27;s handwriting with that of the &quot;bordereau&quot;, he became convinced of Esterhazy&#x27;s guilt of the crime for which Dreyfus had been convicted.

In 1897, after fruitless efforts to persuade his superiors to take the new evidence seriously and being transferred to Tunisia in an effort to silence him, Picquart provided proof to Dreyfus&#x27; lawyers. They started a campaign to bring Esterhazy to justice. In 1898 an ex-lover of Esterhazy made public letters of his in which he expressed his hatred of France and his contempt for the army. However, Esterhazy was still protected by the Army&#x27;s General Staff, which did not want to see the judgment of 1895 put into doubt.

Esterhazy asked for a trial behind closed doors by the French Military Justice (10–11 January 1898). He was acquitted, a judgment which ignited anti-Semitic riots in Paris.

On 13 January 1898, Émile Zola published his famous &quot;J&#x27;Accuse…!&quot;, which accused the French government of anti-Semitism and especially focused on the court-martial and jailing of Dreyfus.

===Flight to Britain and later years===
Esterhazy was discreetly put on military pension with the rank of major. On 1 September 1898, having shaved off his moustache, he fled France, via Brussels, for the relative safety of England. Rachel Beer, editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, English newspapers, knew that Esterhazy was in London because &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Paris correspondent had made a connection with him; she interviewed him twice, and he confessed to being the culprit: &quot;I wrote the bordereau&quot;. She published the interviews in September 1898, reporting his confession and writing a leader column accusing the French military of antisemitism and calling for a retrial for Dreyfus.

From Milton Road in the town of Harpenden, Esterhazy continued to write in anti-Semitic papers such as &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; until his death in 1923. He is buried in St Nicholas&#x27; churchyard, Harpenden, under the name of &quot;Jean de Voilemont&quot;. A headstone was erected shortly after with the false name and a false birthdate with an inscription from Percy Bysshe Shelley: &quot;He has outsoared the shadow of our night&quot;.

===Revisionist thesis: Esterhazy as double agent===

French historian Jean Doise espoused the revisionist hypothesis that Esterhazy might have been a French double agent masquerading as a traitor in order to pass along misinformation to the German Army. Doise was not the first writer to explore the hypothesis of Esterhazy as a double agent: earlier writings by Michel de Lombarès and Henri Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, though they differed in the details of their theories, also presented this line of argument. According to Doise, Esterhazy&#x27;s perceived bitterness and utter lack of patriotic feeling, along with his fluency in German, were qualities that would have helped him to pose as an effective and unrepentant traitor.

In Tunis, he was judged to have become too intimate with the German military attaché. In 1892, he was the object of an accusation made to the head of the staff, General Brault. In 1893, he entered (or, if one accepts the revisionist explanation, pretended to enter) the service of Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen, the German military attaché in Paris. According to later disclosures he received from the German attaché a monthly pension of 2000 marks (equivalent to over €12000 in 2015 terms). In return, Esterhazy furnished him in the first place with information (or, as argued, misinformation) about artillery.

Esterhazy reportedly got his information from Major Henry, who had been his comrade in the French military counter-intelligence section of the War Ministry, in 1876. However, Henry, limited to a very special branch of the service, was hardly in a position to furnish details on technical questions. The main architect of the disinformation campaign is claimed to have been Colonel Sandherr, head of French military counter-intelligence.

The lack of value of the material furnished by Esterhazy soon became so apparent that Alessandro Panizzardi, the Italian military attaché, to whom Schwartzkoppen communicated it without divulging the name of his informant, began to doubt his qualifications as an officer. To convince the attaché, it was necessary for Esterhazy to show himself one day in uniform, galloping behind a well-known general.

The infamous document, or &quot;bordereau&quot;, which was used to convict Dreyfus had been retrieved from a wastepaper basket at the German Embassy by a cleaning lady who was in the employ of French military counterintelligence. This document had been torn up but was easily pieced together. It announced, among other items, a forthcoming report on a new French 120mm howitzer &quot;Canon de 120C Modele 1890 Baquet&quot; and the comportment of its hydraulic recoil mechanism, as well as detailed manuals describing the current organization of French field artillery.&quot;

However, the French Army had already rejected the 120 mm model as unworkable and had begun development of the revolutionary (for its time) 75 mm field gun. The argument is this &quot;bordereau&quot; document was a supposed design to prevent the German military from discovering the development of the French 75.

However, there are reports of Esterhazy admitting that he had &quot;indeed been a spy for Germany&quot;.

These entities are classified through bonding types and relative abundance of isotopes. Types of chemical species can be classified based on the type of molecular entity and can be either an atomic, molecular, ionic or radical species.

== Classification ==
Generally, a chemical species is defined as a chemical identity that has the same set of molecular energy levels in a defined timescale (i.e. an experiment). These energy levels determine the way the chemical species will interact with others through properties such as bonding or isotopic compositions. The chemical species can be an atom, molecule, ion, or radical, with a specific chemical name and chemical formula.

In supramolecular chemistry, chemical species are structures created by forming or breaking bonds between molecules, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole bonds, etc. These types of bonds can determine the physical property of chemical species in a liquid or solid state.

The term is also applied to a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structures in a solid compound. 
=== Types of Chemical Species ===
Atomic species: Specific form of an element defined by the atom&#x27;s isotope, electronic or oxidation state. Argon is an atomic species of formula Ar.

Molecular species: Groups of atoms that are held together by chemical bonds. An example is ozone, which has the chemical formula .

Ionic species: Atoms or molecules that have gained or lost electrons, resulting in a net electrical charge that can be either positively (cation) or negatively charged (anion).

* Species with an overall positive charge will be a cationic species. The sodium ion is an example of a cationic species and its formula is Na+.
* Species with an overall negative charge will be an anionic species. Chloride is an anionic species, and its formula is Cl−.

Radical species: Molecules or atoms with unpaired electrons. Triarlborane anion is a radical species and its formula is Ar3B−

Chemicals can be two different types of species. For example, nitrate is a molecular and ionic species, with its formula being NO3−. 

Note that DNA is not a species; the name is generically applied to many molecules of different formulas (each DNA molecule is unique).

<text>The Platt Amendment was a piece of United States legislation enacted as part of the Army Appropriations Act of 1901 that defined the relationship between the United States and Cuba following the Spanish–American War. It stipulated seven conditions for the withdrawal of United States troops remaining in Cuba at the end of the Spanish–American War, and an eighth condition that Cuba sign a treaty accepting these seven conditions. It helped define the terms of Cuba–United States relations.

On June 12, 1901, the Cuban Constitutional Assembly approved the Platt Amendment, which had been proposed by the United States of America. The document came with a withdrawal of U.S troops from Cuba after the Spanish-American War. It amended its constitution to contain, word for word, the seven applicable demands of the Platt Amendment.

On May 22, 1903, Cuba entered into a treaty with the United States to make the same required seven pledges: the Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1903. Two of the seven pledges were to allow the United States to intervene unilaterally in Cuban affairs, and a pledge to lease land to the United States for naval bases on the island. The Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1934 replaced the 1903 Treaty of Relations, and dropped three of the seven pledges.

The 1903 Treaty of Relations was used as justification for the Second Occupation of Cuba from 1906 to 1909. On September 29, 1906, Secretary of War and future U.S. president William Howard Taft initiated the Second Occupation of Cuba when he established the Provisional Government of Cuba under the terms of the treaty in Article three, declaring himself Provisional Governor of Cuba. On October 23, 1906, President Roosevelt issued , ratifying the order.

On May 29, 1934, the United States and Cuba signed the 1934 Treaty of Relations that in its first article overrides the 1903 Treaty of Relations.

==Background==
During the Spanish–American War, the United States maintained a large military arsenal in Cuba to protect U.S. holdings and to mediate Spanish–Cuban relations. In 1899, the McKinley administration settled on occupation as its response to the appearance of a revolutionary government in Cuba following the end of Spanish control.

The Platt Amendment was an addition to the earlier Teller Amendment, which had previously limited US involvement in Cuba relating to its treatment after the war, particularly in preventing its annexation which had been proposed by various expansionist political entities within the US. Senator Teller himself had a history of opposing American imperialism, criticising the American campaigns in Panama and the Philippines. Yet in 1894 he had been an arch-expansionist supporting potential plans to annex Cuba, and Teller would go on to support the Platt Amendment. 
The Platt Amendment forbid the Government of Cuba from going into any international agreement that could jeopardize or undermine Cuban independence or permit foreign powers to use the island for military purposes. The United States could also and had the absolute right to get involved in any Cuban affairs to defend Cuban independence but also maintain a strong government, one that would serve justice to the people. Also another condition of the Platt Amendment was the United States demanded a naval station for themselves they could use that would be located in Cuba, this eventually led to the lease by the United States of Guantanamo Bay. Lastly, the amendment compelled the Cuban Government to stop a treaty with the United States that would make the Platt amendment authenticated, in which the United States pressured the Cubans to embrace the terms of the Platt Amendment in the Cuban constitution.

Some historians have questioned Teller&#x27;s intentions, claiming that the real motive behind the resolution was to protect American beet sugar growers from Cuban competition. On the other hand, Teller became a leading opponent of land annexation in Cuba to grow sugar in the early 1900s, as well as President Roosevelt&#x27;s plans to grant tariff preferences to Cuba in 1903.

The Platt Amendment originated from American mistrust in the Cuban Constituent Assembly to formulate a new relationship between Cuba and the U.S. Senator Orville H. Platt, chair of the Senate Committee on Relations with Cuba, spearheaded the bill alongside General Leonard Wood, the Governor of Cuba at the time and Secretary of War Elihu Root. Tasked with balancing Cuban independence with American desires to control Cuban politicians deemed unfit for self-governance, they established The Platt Amendment to maintain public order and turn Cuba into a &quot;self-governing colony&quot;. The Platt Amendment was initially intended to be its own bill, but it became an amendment as the 56th Congress ended on March 4, 1901, and there was no time for the proposal to be submitted as a separate bill. 

General Leonard Wood used the financial resources of the Cuban treasury to create sanitation systems. A handful of civil rights, including the right to vote, were extended to literate, adult, male Cubans with property worth $250 or more, largely resulting in exclusion of the Afro-Cuban population and women from participation.

==Provisions of the amendment==
The Platt Amendment was introduced to Congress by Senator Orville H. Platt on February 25, 1901. It passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 43 to 20, and although it was initially rejected by the Cuban assembly, the amendment was eventually accepted by a vote of 16 to 11 with four abstentions and integrated into the 1901 Cuban Constitution. 

The Platt Amendment outlined the role of the United States in Cuba and the Caribbean, limiting Cuba&#x27;s right to make treaties with other nations and restricting Cuba in the conduct of foreign policy and commercial relations. It also established that Cuba&#x27;s boundaries would not include the Isle of Pines (Isla de la Juventud) until its title could be established in a future treaty, and that Cuba must sell or lease lands to the United States necessary for coaling or the development of naval stations.

It read:
After U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt withdrew American troops from the island in 1902, Cuba signed the treaty the next year after which Cuba executed a lease of land to the United States for a coaling and naval station at Guantánamo Bay. Originally the U.S. would have been able to build four military bases, but Cuba managed to negotiate this down to two, those being Guantanamo and Bahia Honda, which was traded in 1912 for more land at Guantanamo. This was a surprise given that Secretary Root had indicated his wish for the U.S. to become the owner and enforcer of Cuba&#x27;s waterfront while the Platt Amendment was being drafted.

==Aftermath==
Following acceptance of the amendment, the United States ratified a tariff that gave Cuban sugar preference in the U.S. market and protection to select U.S. products in the Cuban market. The huge American investment into sugar led to land being concentrated into the hands of the largest sugar mills, however, with estimates that 20% of all Cuban land was owned by these mills. This led to further impoverishment of the rural masses. Workers on the mill were in constant fear of eviction, with cheap imported labor from other parts of the Caribbean keeping wages very low and the prices for independent cane pushed down to a minimum. In addition, the mills monopolized the railroads and ran them for private benefit. The lack of consumer purchasing power and the limited market available for manufactured goods meant that little industrialization would occur in the decade after the 1903 Treaty of Relations. Overall, over $200 million was spent by American companies on Cuban sugar between 1903 and 1913.

Tomás Estrada Palma, who had once favored outright annexation of Cuba by the United States, became president of Cuba on May 20, 1902. He was re-elected in 1905 despite accusations of fraud from his liberal opponents, but was forced to resign along with the rest of the executive when opposition against his rule turned violent. The U.S. invoked the Platt Amendment to begin the Second Occupation of Cuba and install a Provisional Government.

Political instability and frequent American occupation through the early 1900s meant that legitimate constitutional rule was increasingly difficult to come about. Though Cuban citizens enjoyed an improved standard of living in this period, Article 40 of the 1901 Cuban Constitution and Article III of the Platt Amendment meant that constitutional rights could be suspended under emergency provisions. Therefore, the Platt Amendment contributed to an erosion of the individual rights of the Cuban people, and it was not long before the Cuban public were calling for a replacement to the 1901 Constitution.

The Platt Amendment was a major blow to hopes of social advancement for Afro-Cubans, who hoped that their participation in the Spanish-American War would mean equality with the white planters and commercial elites of Cuba. Nearly 40% of the Cuban fighting force against Spain were made up of people of color, and Afro-Cubans had spent generations fighting for their country&#x27;s independence. As well as becoming disenfranchised through voting acts, Afro-Cubans were also blocked from many state institutions as they now required educational or property qualifications to be gained. 

Tensions between Afro-Cubans and U.S. military officials were rife, with hostile language and sometimes gunfire being exchanged between the two groups. Frustrated middle class blacks would launch the Independent Party of Colour (PIC) in 1908, but this was barred by the Cuban Congress soon along with all other parties of colour, accused of inciting race war. The PIC&#x27;s call for limited armed protests would eventually spark the Negro Rebellion of 1912 which killed between 3,000 and 6,000. The rebellion was defeated by the Cuban army and led to the PIC dissolving afterwards. The U.S. sent 1,292 Marines to protect the American-owned companies, as well as copper mines, railroads, and trains. The Marines had only one skirmish with the rebels with no casualties on either side.

Women activists were also disappointed by the result of the Platt Amendment&#x27;s conditions. As with Afro-Cubans, women played important roles in the Cuban independence movement and were characterised as &#x27;mambisas&#x27;, or courageous warrior mothers symbolizing the struggle for social justice. However, they were also denied voting rights and female suffrage would not be obtained until 1940. Any attempts by women to discus equality of the sexes with the Cuban government saw them labeled as nationalists or flat out ignored.

Most of the Platt Amendment provisions were repealed in 1934 when the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934 between the United States and Cuba was negotiated as a part of U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Good Neighbor policy&quot; toward Latin America. José Manuel Cortina and other members of the Cuban Constitutional Convention of 1940 eliminated the Platt Amendment from the new Cuban constitution. 

The long-term lease of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base continues. The Cuban government since 1959 has strongly denounced the treaty as a violation of Article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which declares a treaty void if procured by the threat or use of force. However, Article 4 of the Vienna Convention states that its provisions shall not be applied retroactively.

Historian Louis A. Perez Jr. has argued that the Platt Amendment resulted in the conditions it had hoped to avoid, including Cuban volatility.

==In popular culture==
The Platt Amendment is used in the 1982 film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; as an example of high school students not paying attention in class.

<doc id="241766" wikidata="Q7838660" url="?curid=241766" title="Trepanation in Mesoamerica">
<text>Trepanation in Mesoamerica has been practised by a number of pre-Columbian cultures in the Mesoamerican region, dating from at least the mid-Preclassic era (ca. 1500 BCE), and continuing up to the late Postclassic, or ca. 1200 CE.

Trepanation involves an intentional and planned operation to open or bore into the skull on a live subject, using tools specifically designed for the purpose. This can be accomplished by several techniques, such as drilling, incising and abrasion, or some combination of these. The purpose of such operations ranges from the medicinal (intended to relieve pressure or address a number of other ailments) to the ritualised and experimental.

In pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, evidence for the practice of trepanation and an assortment of other cranial deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources, including physical cranial remains of pre-Columbian burials, allusions in iconographic artworks and reports from the post-conquest period.

==Overview==
Trepanation has been practised by a variety of historical cultures and societies across the globe, with evidence for it dating back to the Neolithic period, and its use has continued up to the present era under certain limited circumstances by a few cultures. If the patient manages to survive the procedure, the bone begins to slowly grow back from the rim of the hole towards the center. This new bone growth is measurably thinner than the undamaged bone at the rim, providing scientists examining a trepanned skull with a means to establishing whether or not the person lived beyond the operation. 
Among New World societies, trepanation is most commonly found in the Andean civilizations such as the Inca, where it is frequently associated with pre-existing cranial damage, indicating that it had a use as a reasonably-successful medical procedure— by one estimate, more than 70% of the patients survived the operation. In 2008, anthropologists have discovered evidence which suggests that survival rates may have been as high as 80 to 90 percent.

Its prevalence among Mesoamerican civilizations is much lower, at least judging from the comparatively few trepanned crania which have been uncovered. The archaeological record is further complicated by the practice of skull mutilation and modification which was carried out &quot;after&quot; the death of the subject, in order to fashion &quot;trophy skulls&quot; and the like, of captives and enemies. This was a reasonably widespread tradition, illustrated in pre-Columbian art which on occasion depicts rulers adorned with or carrying the modified skulls of their defeated enemies, or of the ritualistic display of sacrificial victims. Several Mesoamerican cultures used a skull-rack (known by its Nahuatl term, &quot;tzompantli&quot;) on which skulls were impaled in rows or columns of wooden stakes.

Even so, some evidence of genuine trepanation in Mesoamerica (i.e., where the subject was living) has been recovered.

==Survey==

===Early colonial reports===
Sixteenth-century Spanish colonial accounts like those of Bernardino de Sahagún and Bishop Diego de Landa contain references to the use of trepanation techniques among Mesoamericans to alleviate pain, such as for persistent headaches and that which results from the practice of deliberately deforming the cranium (for aesthetic purposes) by using compression boards and other methods.

===Central Mexico and Oaxaca===
The earliest archaeological survey published of trepanned crania was a late 19th-century study of several specimens recovered from the Tarahumara mountains by the Norwegian ethnographer Carl Lumholtz. Later studies documented cases identified from a range of sites in Oaxaca and central Mexico, such as Tilantongo, Oaxaca and the major Zapotec site of Monte Albán. Two specimens from the Tlatilco civilization&#x27;s homelands (which flourished around 1400 BCE) indicate the practice has a lengthy tradition, although the cultural provenance of these particular specimens has been disputed.

A 1999 study of seven trepanned crania from Monte Albán showed a combination of single and multiple elliptical holes drilled or worn into the cranial cap, performed exclusively on the upper Parietal bones. The sample crania were from both male and female adults, and evidence of healing around the perforations suggested that about half had survived the operation. Most of the skulls in the study showed signs of earlier cranial damage, indicating (as with the Andean examples) that the operations were an attempt to repair or alleviate this head-trauma.

From these analyses, it appears that a technique of straightforward abrasion was employed in the earliest-dated finds, to be combined later on with drilling and incision techniques.

Crania recovered from Cholula show another form of trepanation (&quot;supra-inial lesion&quot;), where a depression has been worn into the back of the skull, without however substantially perforating it.

===Maya region and Yucatán Peninsula===
Specimens identified from the Maya civilization region of southern Mexico, Guatemala and the Yucatán Peninsula show no evidence of the drilling or cutting techniques found in central and highland Mexico. Instead, the pre-Columbian Maya seemed to have utilised an abrasive technique which ground away at the back of the skull, thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it, similar to the examples from Cholula. Many of the skulls from the Maya region date from the Postclassic period (ca. 950–1400), and include specimens found at Palenque in Chiapas and recovered from the Sacred Cenote at the prominent Postclassic site of Chichen Itza in northern Yucatán.

The practice of deliberate cranial deformation or flattening is well documented among the pre-Columbian Maya peoples and is evidenced from the Preclassic era onwards. By the use of cradleboards and other compression techniques applied to the growing skull from infancy, a variety of head-shapes were fashioned, with different regions and time-periods exhibiting a difference in style and ideal. The practice was applied to both males and females and was not thought to be particularly associated with class or social standing. It was widely adopted however, to the point where one particular study which examined over 1,500 skulls drawn from across the Maya region determined that at least 88% exhibited some form of intentional cranial deformation. These practices have no known therapeutic value although they may have been intertwined with the expression of Maya cultural values, beliefs and identity. It is argued by some scholars in the field such as Vera Tiesler, that trepanation among the Maya was also imbued with a culturally significant meaning apart from any medical benefit.

<doc id="241767" wikidata="Q212270" url="?curid=241767" title="Carbocation">
<text>A carbocation is an ion with a positively charged carbon atom. Among the simplest examples are the methenium , methanium , acylium ions , and vinyl cations.

Until the early 1970s, carbocations were called &quot;carbonium ions&quot;. In the present-day definition given by the IUPAC, a carbocation is any even-electron cation with significant partial positive charge on a carbon atom. They are further classified in two main categories according to the coordination number of the charged carbon: three in the carbenium ions and five in the carbonium ions. This nomenclature was proposed by G. A. Olah. Carbonium ions, as originally defined by Olah, are characterized by a three-center two-electron delocalized bonding scheme and are essentially synonymous with so-called &#x27;non-classical carbocations&#x27;, which are carbocations that contain bridging C–C or C–H σ-bonds. However, others have more narrowly defined the term &#x27;carbonium ion&#x27; as formally protonated or alkylated alkanes (, where R is H or alkyl), to the exclusion of non-classical carbocations like the 2-norbornyl cation.

==Definitions==
According to the IUPAC, a &quot;carbocation&quot; is any cation containing an even number of electrons in which a significant portion of the positive charge resides on a carbon atom. Prior to the observation of five-coordinate carbocations by Olah and coworkers, &quot;carbocation&quot; and &quot;carbonium ion&quot; were used interchangeably. Olah proposed a redefinition of &quot;carbonium ion&quot; as a carbocation featuring any type of three-center two-electron bonding, while a &quot;carbenium ion&quot; was newly coined to refer to a carbocation containing only two-center two-electron bonds with a three-coordinate positive carbon. Subsequently, others have used the term &quot;carbonium ion&quot; more narrowly to refer to species that are derived (at least formally) from electrophilic attack of H+ or R+ on an alkane, in analogy to other main group onium species, while a carbocation that contains any type of three-centered bonding is referred to as a &quot;non-classical carbocation&quot;. In this usage, 2-norbornyl cation is not a carbonium ion, because it is formally derived from protonation of an alkene (norbornene) rather than an alkane, although it is a non-classical carbocation due to its bridged structure. The IUPAC acknowledges the three divergent definitions of carbonium ion and urges care in the usage of this term. For the remainder of this article, the term &quot;carbonium ion&quot; will be used in this latter restricted sense, while &quot;non-classical carbocation&quot; will be used to refer to any carbocation with C–C and/or C–H σ-bonds delocalized by bridging.

==Structure and properties==
===Carbonium ions===
Carbonium ions can be thought of as protonated or alkylated alkanes, bearing the general formula CR5+ (R = alkyl or H). A typical example is the methanium ion, CH5+, which is formed by protonation of methane using a superacid. By necessity of having five bonds on carbon but only four valence electron pairs available for bonding, they feature delocalized 3c-2e σ bonding and are thus regarded as type of non-classical carbocation. Like carbenium ions, carbonium ions are often invoked as intermediates in the upgrading of hydrocarbons in refineries. They are generally fleeting intermediates with fluxional structures that are challenging to observe and interpret spectroscopically. They can undergo decomposition by expulsion of a proton or alkyl group, or by loss of H2 to give a carbenium ion.

=== Non-classical carbenium ions ===
Non-classical carbenium ions feature also σ delocalization (3c2e bonds) in their bonding but have the general formula CR3+ (R = alkyl or H). Thus, in principle, one can propose non-bridged, classical structures for these cations, as well as a bridged non-classical structure. Because of the subtle differences in the expected behavior of a non-classical carbenium ions compared to the alternative hypothesis of two rapidly equilibrating classical structures, a lively and often acrimonious debate took place over several decades regarding the merits of each model. For a detailed history of this dispute, see the article on the 2-norbornyl cation. Currently, there is overwhelming evidence that, at least in some cases (notably the extremely well-studied 2-norbornyl cation), the equilibrium structure of a carbenium ion is non-classical, although even minor changes in structure could result in a classical structure being favored. 

===Classical carbenium ions===
At least in a formal sense, carbenium ions (CR3+) are derived from the protonation (addition of ) or alkylation (addition of ) of a carbene or alkene. Thus, in at least one of their resonance depictions, they possess a carbon atom bearing a formal positive charge that is surrounded by a sextet of electrons (six valence electrons) instead of the usual octet required to fill the valence shell of carbon (octet rule). Therefore, carbenium ions (and carbocations in general) are often reactive, seeking to fill the octet of valence electrons as well as regain a neutral charge. In accord with VSEPR and Bent&#x27;s rule, unless geometrically constrained to be pyramidal (e.g., 1-adamantyl cation), 3-coordinate carbon in carbenium ions are usually trigonal planar, with a pure p character empty orbital as its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and CH/CC bonds formed from C(sp2) orbitals. A prototypical example is the &quot;t-&quot;butyl cation, . Although classical carbenium ions have a structure that corresponds to a non-bridging Lewis structure, it is important to note that donation of electron density from neighboring C–H or C–C bonds into the &quot;empty&quot; p orbital, known as hyperconjugation, is still an important stabilizing factor, and these bonds have a tendency to &quot;lean&quot; towards the carbocationic center to improve orbital overlap. There is, in fact, an entire spectrum of bonding scenarios between a slight lean due to hyperconjugation to a fully symmetric bridging structure featuring 3c2e bonding. Consequently, there is no firm dividing line between &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;non-classical&quot; structures. 

==History==
The history of carbocations dates back to 1891 when G. Merling reported that he added bromine to tropylidene (cycloheptatriene) and then heated the product to obtain a crystalline, water-soluble material, . He did not suggest a structure for it; however, Doering and Knox convincingly showed that it was tropylium (cycloheptatrienylium) bromide. This ion is predicted to be aromatic by Hückel&#x27;s rule.

In 1902, Norris and Kehrman independently discovered that colorless triphenylmethanol gives deep-yellow solutions in concentrated sulfuric acid. Triphenylmethyl chloride similarly formed orange complexes when treated with aluminium and tin chlorides. In 1902, Adolf von Baeyer recognized the salt-like character of the compounds formed. He dubbed the relationship between color and salt formation halochromy, of which malachite green is a prime example. The trityl carbocation (shown below) is indeed a stable carbocationic system, for example in the form of trityl hexafluorophosphate.

Carbocations are reactive intermediates in many organic reactions. This idea, first proposed by Julius Stieglitz in 1899, was further developed by Hans Meerwein in his 1922 study of the Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement. Carbocations were also found to be involved in the SN1 reaction, the E1 reaction, and in rearrangement reactions such as the Whitmore 1,2 shift. The chemical establishment was reluctant to accept the notion of a carbocation and for a long time the Journal of the American Chemical Society refused articles that mentioned them.

An NMR spectrum of a carbocation was first reported by Doering et al. in 1958. It was the heptamethylbenzenium ion, made by treating hexamethylbenzene with methyl chloride and aluminium chloride. The stable 7-norbornadienyl cation was prepared by Story et al. in 1960 by reacting norbornadienyl chloride with silver tetrafluoroborate in sulfur dioxide at −80 °C. The NMR spectrum established that it was non-classically bridged (the first stable non-classical ion observed).

In 1962, Olah directly observed the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl carbocation by nuclear magnetic resonance as a stable species on dissolving &quot;tert&quot;-butyl fluoride in magic acid. The NMR spectrum of the norbornyl cation was reported by Schleyer et al. It was shown to rapidly undergo proton-scrambling .

<text>Catherine Millet (; born 1 April 1948) is a French writer, art critic, curator, and founder and editor of the magazine &quot;Art Press&quot;, which focuses on modern art and contemporary art.

==Biography==
Born in Bois-Colombes, France, she is best known as the author of the 2002 memoir &quot;The Sexual Life of Catherine M.&quot;; the book details her sexual history, from childhood masturbation to an adult fascination with group sex. The book was reviewed by Edmund White as &quot;the most explicit book about sex ever written by a woman&quot;.

In 2008 she published a sequel of sorts called &quot;Jour de Souffrance&quot;, translated to English in 2009 as &quot;Jealousy: The Other Life of Catherine M.&quot;

She is married to the poet and novelist Jacques Henric.

In April 2016, Catherine Millet received the &quot;Prix François Morellet&quot; from Régine Catin, Laurent Hamon and Philippe Méaille. Awarded during the &quot;National Days of Book and Wine&quot; (Saumur), in partnership with the Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art; it rewards a personality for their commitment and their writings in favor of contemporary art.

In December 2017, during an interview on the French radio France Culture she claimed &quot;I really regret not having been raped, because I could show that you can recover from it&quot;.

In January 2018 she co-authored a public letter to Le Monde newspaper criticising the #MeToo movement. The letter was signed by over a hundred French women, including actress Catherine Deneuve, and generated considerable controversy.

<doc id="241775" wikidata="Q3297378" url="?curid=241775" title="King Snake">
<text>King Snake (Sir Edmund Dorrance) is a character appearing in media published by DC Comics, usually as an adversary of Robin (Tim Drake) and Batman. Created by writer Chuck Dixon and artist Tom Lyle, King Snake first appeared in &quot;Robin #2&quot; (1991). He is a master martial artist and the father of the villain Bane.

==Fictional character biography==
Edmund Dorrance is a British mercenary and former member of the Royal Artillery. While in Santa Prisca, he has a one-night stand with a fellow rebel before being injured and blinded in a fight and forced to leave the country. Both the woman and her child are imprisoned for Edmund&#x27;s crimes, with the latter growing up to become Bane.

Edmund subsequently moves to Hong Kong and becomes a drug trader masquerading as a legitimate businessman. After Lady Shiva breaks his back, he has his spine reinforced with steel to assist in his recovery.

King Snake later joins the terrorist cult Kobra and battles Danny Temple for leadership. After being defeated, he reunites with Bane, who kills him in a fight.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, King Snake is temporarily revived as a Black Lantern. He later returns permanently following the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch.

==Powers and abilities==
King Snake has no superhuman powers. However, he is a master of several of the world&#x27;s most deadly martial arts. After being blinded during an operation in Santa Prisca, he hones his other senses to compensate.

==In other media==

* King Snake appears in &quot;&quot;, voiced by Patrick Seitz.
* King Snake appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<text>Tetrachloroethylene, also known as perchloroethylene or under the systematic name tetrachloroethene, and abbreviations such as perc (or PERC), and PCE, is a chlorocarbon with the formula . It is a non-flammable, stable, colorless and heavy liquid widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics. It also has its uses as an effective automotive brake cleaner. It has a mildly sweet, sharp odor, detectable by most people at a concentration of 50 ppm. 

Tetrachloroethylene is regarded as a toxic substance, a human health hazard, and an environmental hazard. In 2020, the United States Environmental Protection Agency stated that &quot;tetrachloroethylene exposure may harm the nervous system, liver, kidneys, and reproductive system, and may be harmful to unborn children&quot;, and reported that numerous toxicology agencies regard it as a carcinogen.

==History and production==
French chemist Henri Victor Regnault first synthesized tetrachloroethylene in 1839 by thermal decomposition of hexachloroethane following Michael Faraday&#x27;s 1820 synthesis of protochloride of carbon (carbon tetrachloride).
Faraday was previously falsely credited for the synthesis of tetrachloroethylene, which in reality, was carbon tetrachloride. While trying to make Faraday&#x27;s &quot;protochloride of carbon&quot;, Regnault found that his compound was different from Faraday&#x27;s. Victor Regnault stated &quot;According to Faraday, the chloride of carbon boiled around to degrees Celsius but mine did not begin to boil until &quot;.

Tetrachloroethylene can be made by passing chloroform vapour through a red-hot tube, the side products include hexachlorobenzene and hexachloroethane, as reported in 1886.

Most tetrachloroethylene is produced by high-temperature chlorinolysis of light hydrocarbons. The method is related to Faraday&#x27;s method since hexachloroethane is generated and thermally decomposes. Side products include carbon tetrachloride, hydrogen chloride, and hexachlorobutadiene.

Several other methods have been developed. When 1,2-dichloroethane is heated to 400 °C with chlorine, tetrachloroethylene is produced:
This reaction can be catalyzed by a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminium chloride or by activated carbon. Trichloroethylene is a major byproduct, which is separated by distillation.

Worldwide production was about in 1985.

Although in very small amounts, tetrachloroethylene occurs naturally in volcanoes along with trichloroethylene.

==Uses==
Tetrachloroethylene is a nonpolar solvent for organic materials. Additionally, it is volatile, relatively stable, and non-flammable. For these reasons, it became a leading solvent in dry cleaning operations worldwide beginning in the 1940s. The chemist Sylvia Stoesser (1901–1991) had suggested tetrachloroethylene to be used in dry cleaning as an alternative to highly flammable dry cleaning solvents such as naphtha.

It is also used to degrease metal parts in the automotive and other metalworking industries, usually as a mixture with other chlorocarbons. It has also been used in consumer products including paint strippers, aerosol preparations, adhesives, and spot removers.

===Historical applications===
Tetrachloroethylene was once extensively used as an intermediate in the manufacture of HFC-134a and related refrigerants.

In the early 20th century, tetrachloroethene was used for the treatment of hookworm infestation. In 1925, American veterinarian Maurice Crowther Hall (1881–1938), working on anthelmintics, demonstrated the effectiveness of tetrachloroethylene in the treatment of ancylostomiasis caused by hookworm infestation in humans and animals. Before Hall tested tetrachloroethylene on himself, in 1921 he discovered the effectiveness of carbon tetrachloride on intestinal parasites and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, but a few years later he found tetrachloroethylene to be more effective and safer.
Tetrachloroethylene treatment has played a vital role in eradicating hookworms in the United States and abroad. Hall&#x27;s innovation was considered a breakthrough in medicine. It was given orally as a liquid or in capsules along with magnesium sulfate to get rid of the &quot;Necator americanus&quot; parasite in humans.

==Chemical properties and reactions==
Tetrachloroethylene is a derivative of ethylene with all hydrogens replaced by chlorine. 14.49% of the molecular weight of tetrachloroethylene consists of carbon and the remaining 85.5% is chlorine. It is the most stable compound among all chlorinated derivatives of ethane and ethylene. It is resistant to hydrolysis and less corrosive than other chlorinated solvents. It does not tend to polymerise like fluorine analogue tetrafluoroethylene, .

Tetrachloroethylene may react violently with alkali or alkaline earth metals, alkalis (sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide), nitric acid, beryllium, barium and aluminium.

===Oxidation===
Oxidation of tetrachloroethylene by ultraviolet radiation in air produces trichloroacetyl chloride and phosgene:
This reaction can be halted by using amines and phenols (usually &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrole and &quot;N&quot;-methylmorpholine) as stabilisers. But the reaction can be done intentionally to produce trichloroacetyl chloride.

===Chlorination===
Hexachloroethane is formed when tetrachloroethylene reacts with chlorine at 50–80 °C in the presence of a small amount of iron(III) chloride (0.1%) as a catalyst:
CFC-113 is produced by the reaction of tetrachloroethylene with chlorine and HF in the presence of antimony pentafluoride:

===Nitration===
Tetrachlorodinitroethane can be obtained by nitration of tetrachloroethylene with fuming nitric acid (conc. rich in nitrogen oxides) or nitrogen tetroxide:
The preparation of this crystalline solid compound from Tetrachloroethylene and nitrogen tetroxide was first described by Hermann Kolbe in 1869.

===Thermal decomposition===
Tetrachloroethylene begins to thermally decompose at 400 °C, decomposition accelerates around 600 °C, and completely decomposes at 800 °C. Organic decomposition products identified were trichlorobutene, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanone, tetrachlorobutadiene, dichlorocyclopentane, dichloropentene, methyl trichloroacetate, tetrachloroacetone, tetrachloropropene, trichlorocyclopentane, trichloropentene, hexachloroethane, pentachloropropene, hexachloropropene, hexachlorobutadiene.

==Health and safety==
Tetrachloroethylene is considered to be a toxin. It is identified as a health hazard and environmental hazard. Exposure to tetrachloroethylene, especially over a long term, may harm the nervous system, other organs, and increase the risk of getting cancer. It may also have effects on pregnancy and the fetus.

Reports of human injury are uncommon despite its wide usage in dry cleaning and degreasing. Although limited by its low volatility, tetrachloroethylene has potent anaesthetic effects upon inhalation. The risk depends on whether exposure is over minutes or hours, or over years.

Despite the advantages of tetrachloroethylene, cancer research and government environmental agencies have called for its replacement from widespread commercial use. It is described as a possible neurotoxicant, liver and kidney toxicant and reproductive and developmental toxicant (...) a potential occupational carcinogen. On the other hand, dry cleaning industry emphasizes minimal risk because modern machinery use closed systems to avoid any vapour escape and to optimize recycling.

=== Metabolism ===
Tetrachloroethylene&#x27;s biological half-life is approximately 3 days. About 98% of the inhaled tetrachloroethylene is exhaled unchanged and only about 1–3% is metabolised to tetrachloroethylene oxide which rapidly isomerises into trichloroacetyl chloride. Trichloroacetyl chloride hydrolyses to trichloroacetic acid.

===Neurotoxicity===
Tetrachloroethylene can harm the nervous system, cause developmental deficits in children, impair vision, and increase the risk of psychiatric diagnoses.

=== Carcinogenicity ===
Tetrachloroethylene has been classified as &quot;Group 2A: Probably Carcinogenic&quot; by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) due to sufficient evidence in experimental animals and limited evidence in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, urinary bladder cancers, and cancers of the esophagus and cervix.

Evidence from cohort and case-controlled epidemiologic studies demonstrates a positive association between cumulative exposures to tetrachloroethylene and the prevalence of bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in adults. Some limited evidence of increased prevalence of kidney, lung, liver, and breast cancers with exposure to tetrachloroethylene has been found in epidemiologic research, but data quality limitations have produced variable results across studies.

Several modes of action are hypothesized for the carcinogenicity of tetrachloroethylene in humans, though existing data is insufficient for adequate characterization. Markers of oxidative metabolism of tetrachloroethylene and increased prevalence of abnormal hepatic sonographs have been observed in dry-cleaners and laundry workers exposed to tetrachloroethylene, which suggests a potential for hepatocellular damage through the formation of reactive intermediates from glutathione conjugates during metabolization. Although most genotoxicity assays of tetrachloroethylene produced negative findings for genotoxicity and mutagenicity, modest genotoxic effects and mutagenic effects have been identified under certain metabolic activation conditions, and several of tetrachloroethylene&#x27;s metabolites have been shown to be mutagenic.

===Testing for exposure===
Tetrachloroethylene exposure can be evaluated by a breath test, analogous to breath-alcohol measurements. Also, for acute exposures, tetrachloroethylene in expired air can be measured. Tetrachloroethylene can be detected in the breath for weeks following a heavy exposure. Tetrachloroethylene and its metabolite trichloroacetic acid, can be detected in the blood.

In the European Union, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) recommends for tetrachloroethylene an occupational exposure limit (8-hour time-weighted average) of 20 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 40 ppm.

==Remediation and degradation==
In principle, tetrachloroethylene contamination can be remediated by chemical treatment. Chemical treatment involves reducing metals such as iron powder.

Bioremediation usually entails reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions by &quot;Dehalococcoides&quot; spp. Under aerobic conditions, degradation may occur via co-metabolism by &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; sp. Products of biological reductive dechlorination include trichloroethylene, &quot;cis&quot;-1,2-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene and chloride.
