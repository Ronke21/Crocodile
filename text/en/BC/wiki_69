<text>John Wayne Airport is an international commercial and general aviation airport that serves Orange County and the Greater Los Angeles area, in the U.S. state of California. The airport is located in an unincorporated area of Orange County, and it is owned and operated by the county. John Wayne Airport is surrounded by the cities of Irvine, Newport Beach, and Costa Mesa, although its IATA airport code is registered to Santa Ana, the county seat. Originally named Orange County Airport, the Orange County Board of Supervisors renamed the airport in 1979 in honor of actor John Wayne, who lived in neighboring Newport Beach and died that year. A statue of John Wayne was installed at the airline terminal in 1982.

John Wayne Airport is the sole commercial airport in Orange County. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 4,584,147 enplanements in calendar year 2014, an increase from 4,450,628 in 2013. In 2014, John Wayne Airport was the second busiest airport in the Greater Los Angeles area (by passenger count) with over 9 million total passengers. , the largest airlines at John Wayne Airport were Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Alaska Airlines.

In addition to the airline terminal, several facilities at the airport serve the general aviation and corporate aviation community. General aviation operations outnumber commercial operations. The only other general aviation airport in Orange County is Fullerton Municipal Airport.

John Wayne Airport has two runways. The main runway, 2L/20R, at in length, is the shortest runway in the United States that handles regularly scheduled international flights, and passenger jetliners operating from the airport have never been larger than the Boeing 757 (although some larger cargo aircraft fly from SNA, such as the widebody Airbus A300 operated by FedEx). Runway 2R/20L is long and serves general aviation aircraft. No widebody passenger jetliners have ever been operated into SNA in scheduled airline service.

==History==


The first airstrip in the area was constructed in 1923, when Eddie Martin signed a five-year lease with James Irvine to operate a flying school on land owned by the Irvine Company. It was purchased through a land swap by the County of Orange in 1939 and remains under the county&#x27;s ownership and management.

Martin added the first hangar to his airfield in 1926. In 1935 Howard Hughes staged his world speed record-setting flight from the Eddie Martin Airport. At some point between 1940 and 1941, the new Orange County Airport was established on land adjacent to Martin Field, to the south. Martin Field closed shortly thereafter.

The facility was used as part of the Santa Ana Army Air Base during World War II, after which it was returned by the federal government to the county with the stipulation that it remain open to all kinds of aviation uses.

In addition to continuing to serve aviation, the field became an important drag racing center. From 1950 to 1959, C.J. &quot;Pappy&quot; Hart and Creighton Hunter operated the Santa Ana Drag Strip, credited for being the world&#x27;s first commercial drag strip, on the airport runway every Sunday, when it was closed to air traffic.

The original single runway was long, on a magnetic heading of 210 degrees (Runway 21) and 30 degrees (Runway 3). In 1964 the airport was rebuilt, with its present two parallel runway configuration, oriented 190/10 degrees magnetic. The longer runway, 19R (now 20R), at , is only longer than the old Runway 21 but long enough to accommodate jet airliners. A full instrument landing system (ILS) was also installed.

In the 1950s, the only airline flights were Bonanza&#x27;s few flights between Los Angeles and Phoenix, via San Diego. In 1963 Bonanza started nonstop F27s to Phoenix, and to Las Vegas in 1965; in 1967 Air California started Electra nonstops to San Francisco, 48 flights a week each way. The first scheduled jet flights were Bonanza DC-9s later in 1967. From 1967 through 1980, Air California (later renamed AirCal) and Bonanza and its successors, Air West and Hughes Airwest, had a duopoly at the airport, until the FAA ruled this illegal.

In 1967, the Eddie Martin Terminal, designed by William L. Pereira &amp; Associates, was built to accommodate 400,000 annual passengers. Remodeling added two passenger holding areas in 1974, a new baggage claim area in 1980 and a terminal annex building in 1982, bringing the facility to .

Nonstop flights reached Salt Lake City in 1976–77 (Hughes DC-9s), Denver in 1982 (Frontier MD-80s), Dallas/Fort Worth in 1983 (American MD-80s), Chicago–O&#x27;Hare in 1986 (AirCal 737-300s), and New York–Kennedy in 1991 (America West 757-200s).
After the Orange County Airport was renamed John Wayne Airport on June 20, 1979, the John Wayne Associates commissioned sculptor Robert Summers to create a bronze statue of &quot;the Duke&quot;. The statue, created at Hoka Hey Foundry in Dublin, Texas, was dedicated to the County on November 4, 1982. Today, the bronze statue is in the Thomas F. Riley Terminal on the Arrival Level.
In 1990, the Thomas F. Riley Terminal opened. The aging Eddie Martin Terminal was replaced with a modern facility. The new facility included 14 loading bridges, four baggage carousels, wide-open spaces and distinct roadside arrival and departure levels. In 1994, the then-unused Eddie Martin Terminal was demolished.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new, larger airport was proposed for the nearby site of the then recently closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. However, after a series of political battles, combined with significant opposition from residents in the vicinity of El Toro, the proposal was defeated, and no new airport was built.

In 2011, additional terminal space was added and existing terminals were refreshed as part of a $543 million expansion project. A new Terminal C with six additional gates was built along with dedicated commuter gate areas in the new Terminal C and new commuter facilities in Terminal A. A new parking lot C was added along with additional support facilities such as a Central Utility plant.

In June 2020, an airport name change was requested, due to comments John Wayne made, believed to be in support of white supremacy to &quot;Playboy&quot; in a 1971 interview.

In September 2020, Orange County officials have planned to end all of JSX operations at SNA on January 1, 2021, stating it is &quot;no longer welcomed&quot;. This announcement prompted the airline to seek support from customers, encouraging them to contact the Orange County officials for reconsideration in order for the airline to continue operations at Orange County. Since December 2020, the airline has filed a lawsuit against the airport, stating that it has &quot;refused to offer any accommodations&quot; to the airline. It stated that the airport &quot;discriminatorily chose&quot; to terminate the airline&#x27;s operations at SNA &quot;in favor of two large airlines [Spirit and Allegiant Airlines]...&quot; which the former already operates the same flights to Las Vegas, Reno, and Oakland. Shortly afterwards, the airline won a temporary restraining order, preventing the airport officials from terminating the airline&#x27;s operations in which a spokeswoman said the airport will comply.

==Terminals==

There are 22 gates in total. The main passenger terminal, the Thomas F. Riley Terminal, is named for the late county supervisor who lobbied for the airport&#x27;s expansion in the 1980s. The Thomas F. Riley Terminal is divided into three terminal areas, A, B and C, with dedicated commuter gate areas at the north end of Terminal A and south end of Terminal C.

All three terminals, A, B and C, are within the same Thomas F. Riley building and security screened passengers can move &quot;airside&quot; between all terminal areas. Security screening lanes exist in all three terminals adjacent to check-in. All security screening areas also have a &quot;fast track&quot; lane for first-class and elite frequent fliers along with full TSA PreCheck availability based on TSA defined schedules. Switching between terminals indoors before security &quot;landside&quot; is also possible, the check-in counter areas between all three terminals have connecting walkways to allow access between all terminals. Complimentary Wi-Fi is provided in all three terminals.

===Terminals A and B===
Terminals A and B were built in 1990 to replace the former Eddie Martin Terminal which was closed upon the new terminals&#x27; opening. In November 2011, Terminal A added a dedicated commuter gate area, along with refreshed gates, signage and information displays at both Terminals A and B.

Terminals A and B were designed by Gensler &amp; Associates, Leason Pomeroy Associates, and Thompson Consultants International. They contain restaurants, bars and shops, with a themed restaurant located in the airside connecting area of both terminals. In the upper rotunda above the themed restaurant is an American Airlines Admirals Club (operating out of Terminal A) and a United Club (operating out of Terminal B). The two lounges lie adjacent to each other on the mezzanine level. Terminal A has gates 1–8, and Terminal B has gates 9–15.

===Terminal C===
Terminal C opened in November 2011 and added seven new gates, a dedicated commuter gate area and new eateries and retail.

Terminal C also provides a U.S. Customs and Border Protection FIS/Federal Inspection Service for international flights that do not have pre-clearance. Two arrival gates feed into the FIS and passengers once cleared exit at the south end of the Terminal C arrivals area. The FIS facility has Global Entry kiosks for registered users to shorten processing time. The FIS facility was designed by Gensler. Terminal C has gates 16–22.

===Arrivals level===
The Arrivals level is on the lower level of the airport and provides seven baggage claim belts, two in Terminal A, two in Terminal B and three in Terminal C. Baggage Claim 7 is for international arrivals. Immediately outside the baggage claim is the curbside arrivals pickup area. Rental car offices are between Terminal A and B baggage claim areas with most rental agencies on-site in the lower levels of the parking facility across the arrivals pickup area between Terminal A and B. Across the roadway from the arrivals pickup area between Terminal A and B is an island for public transportation, including taxis and buses.

==International service==
John Wayne Airport offers international flights to Mexico and Canada. The airport did not have any regularly scheduled international service up until 2010 when Air Canada began operations to Toronto, Ontario. Flights from Canada complete immigration and customs formalities in Canada via United States border preclearance.

Southwest Airlines is operating international flights to Puerto Vallarta and San José del Cabo in Mexico as of March 11, 2021. Prior to resumption, it previously served flights to Puerto Vallarta from June 18, 2015, until March 2017. Southwest has also served flights to Cabo San Lucas until March 2020, alongside terminating other destinations at the time due to passenger limitations following a 1985 settlement agreement.

Canadian airline WestJet provides non-stop year round service to Vancouver since May 2011. It is also serving direct flights to Calgary; it previously served that route from June 2011 to 2013 before ending operations up until its resumption on November 4, 2021.

Air Canada also provides daily non-stop flights to Vancouver, British Columbia since October 2, 2021. It was set to start flights in June 2020, and then delayed to September 8, 2020, and then to May 2021, which would have marked its return to service to Orange County after 10 years. It previously operated flights to Toronto, Ontario from April 8, 2010, becoming the first-ever international airline to serve Orange County, until it ceased flights later that year.

Alaska Airlines was scheduled for international service to Vancouver in 2002. However, a stop in Seattle (or change of planes) was required shortly after launch as John Wayne Airport was not authorized for pre-clearance or international flights by U.S. agencies at the time.

Southwest Airlines&#x27; then-subsidiary AirTran Airways began a new service in June 2012 from John Wayne Airport to Cabo San Lucas and Mexico City. This was the first international service to use the new FIS in Terminal C. After its merger with AirTran was completed in 2014, Southwest continued to operate the Mexico flights under its original brand. However, Southwest then ended its service to Mexico City (MEX) from SNA in January 2017 before completely discontinuing all flights to MEX in March 2019.

Mexico&#x27;s low-cost carrier Interjet began a new service in October 2012 from Orange County to Guadalajara and Mexico City. It ended both flights in July 2014; the airport officials are seeking a replacement.

Alaska Airlines began a Mexico service in October 2015. The airline began offering non-stop flights from John Wayne Airport to Los Cabos on October 8 and Puerto Vallarta on the following day, October 9. Alaska Airlines has continued this service to each airport on an every-other-day rotation. Since August 2019, the airline has discontinued flights to Mexico.

Airline officials have also been in negotiations with Mexican low-cost airline Volaris, which has applied for an Orange County slot.

==Aircraft noise abatement and curfew==
A 1985 settlement agreement defined the scope of operation for John Wayne Airport in how it affects the local community. The area that lies directly south of John Wayne Airport is considered a noise-sensitive area. The agreement in conjunction with a Phase 2 Commercial Airline Access Plan and Regulation controls the number of noisier operations (mainly commercial aircraft) allowed from the airport. Noise abatement enforcement is carried out with the aid of 10 permanent noise monitoring stations. These stations are placed in areas that exceed a community noise equivalent level (CNEL) of 65 dB. Noise reports are published by the airport and are available to the public.

The takeoff procedure at John Wayne Airport is unique because of the local noise restrictions and short runway. When using the typical traffic pattern (departures from runway 20R) most commercial airliners cycle to full power (95–97%) while holding at the end of the runway then release the brakes when engines are fully spooled up. Pilots must make a steep 25 degree climb to , where engine power is reduced to reduce noise. Pilots must also make a left turn after departure to 175 degrees to enter a corridor over the city of Newport Beach where the noise was deemed to be the least disruptive. These procedures have led passengers to rate John Wayne Airport as one of the nation&#x27;s scariest.

Departures from 2L (normally during Santa Ana wind conditions) are not affected by these noise abatement procedures. Landings are also typically on runway 20R and almost always include full flap extensions and the use of full reverse thrust. Extension of the runway is almost impossible, as both ends are bounded by freeways along with numerous residences and businesses.

The county prohibits commercial departures between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM (8:00 AM on Sundays) and commercial arrivals between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM (8:00 AM on Sundays). Exceptions can be made for an emergency, mechanical, air traffic control, or weather delay, which is beyond the airline&#x27;s control. Curfew exceptions by carrier are published by the airport and are available to the public.

=== Settlement amendments ===
In 2003, the settlement agreement was amended to increase operations but only for aircraft meeting the lowest noise signatures. The amendment increased the annual passenger limit to 10.8 million, up from the original 8.4-million limit.

In 2014, the Orange County Board of Supervisors set the airport restrictions for 2021 at 11.8 million passengers per year. This limit was to be an increase from 10.8 million annual passengers previously.

In 2026, the annual passenger limit is expected to increase to 12.2 or 12.5 million through 2030. The higher limit will be allowed only if the number of passengers reaches 95% of the annual limit in each year between 2021 and 2025.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Law enforcement operations==

Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Department

John Wayne Airport has been the main base for the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Department&#x27;s Air Support Unit since 1985 when the county&#x27;s board of supervisors approved the purchase of two Hughes MD 500E aircraft nicknamed &quot;Duke I&quot; and &quot;Duke II&quot;. In 1998, the OCSD traded their MD 500E helicopters for newer McDonnell Douglas MD 600N helicopters, becoming the first law enforcement agency to operate the MD 600N. These helicopters were faster, quieter, and safer than the MD 500E.

The Air Support Unit currently operates of fleet of Eurocopter AS350 AStar helicopters, with a Bell UH-1 Iroquois used for search and rescue purposes.

Costa Mesa Police Department

The Costa Mesa Police Department operated an aviation unit out of John Wayne Airport for 41 years. The division was called &quot;ABLE&quot; for Airborne Law Enforcement. ABLE disbanded in 2012; the unit&#x27;s helicopters at the time of the disbandment were three Eurocopter EC120 Colibris.

==Accidents and incidents==
On February 17, 1981, Air California (AirCal) Flight 336 (a Boeing 737-200), with 105 passengers and five crew members, was flying from San Jose, to John Wayne Airport and crashed upon initiating a go-around. The crew was cleared for a visual approach to Runway 19R while the controller had cleared a smaller plane to take off from 19R. Upon realizing that the landing aircraft might overtake the departing one, the controller ordered the flight to go around and the other aircraft to abort its takeoff, which it did. The captain of the landing Air California aircraft delayed the go-around then initiated a gear up procedure before a positive rate of climb was achieved, causing the plane to stall. The 737 then banked left at low altitude causing the left wingtip to make contact with the runway. Then the nose came down, striking the ground, and the airplane spun around and skidded down the runway before coming to rest in the margin. A fire started, but the passengers and crew exited the plane. Of the passengers, four sustained serious injuries, and 29 suffered minor injuries. The aircraft, registered N468AC, was damaged beyond repair and was written off.

On December 15, 1993, a chartered IAI Westwind business jet carrying two flight crew members and three passengers (including Rich Snyder, president of In-N-Out Burger), crashed while on approach to John Wayne Airport. All five occupants were killed in the crash. The aircraft, which departed Brackett Field, 30 miles to the north in La Verne, followed a Boeing 757 for landing, became caught in the 757&#x27;s wake turbulence, rolled into a deep descent, and crashed near the intersection of State Route 55 and Edinger Avenue. The crash investigation led to the FAA requirement for an adequate period between heavy aircraft and following light aircraft to allow wake turbulence to diminish.

On February 13, 2017, Harrison Ford accidentally landed his Aviat Husky on taxiway C, to the left of runway 20L. A Boeing 737 was holding short of 20L on the taxiway when Ford overflew them.

On June 30, 2017, a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft crashed short of a runway into a highway median on Interstate 405. The pilot made a mayday call shortly after taking off from John Wayne Airport and attempted to land after being cleared for emergency landing on runway 20R. Two people on board were injured in the crash.

On August 5, 2018, a Cessna 414 scheduled to land at John Wayne Airport crashed into a Staples parking lot a few blocks north of the airport in nearby Santa Ana, killing at least five people.

On January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76B helicopter took off from John Wayne Airport at approximately 9:06 am PST carrying retired NBA basketball player Kobe Bryant along with his 13-year-old daughter, and 7 others bound for Camarillo Airport for a basketball event in Thousand Oaks. En route, the helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas south of U.S. Route 101, killing everyone on board. The helicopter had been seen in distress under heavy fog, according to witnesses. The cause of the crash was pilot error and spatial disorientation.

On the evening of August 20, 2021, an unauthorized person bypassed security and gained access to the tarmac near Terminal C, prompting a lockdown of the airport. The suspect took control of a ground crew vehicle and drove it around before abandoning it and re-entering the terminal. Police later discovered the suspect hiding in an attic space inside the terminal and took him into custody.

On August 20, 2023, Alaska Airlines Flight 1288, a Boeing 737-800 under the registration N516AS suffered landing gear damage after a rough landing upon arrival at John Wayne Airport during Tropical Storm Hilary. The flight, AS1288, originated from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. A video of the landing filmed from inside the cabin and posted online showed a commotion among the passengers and sparks on the runway from the plane. There were no injuries reported in the accident, and the aircraft was repaired.

On November 20, 2023, a Cessna 172 taxiing on a runway was flipped over on its high wings by the Santa Ana winds. The pilot was just outside of the plane when it flipped over and was not injured. The airfield was closed for 20 minutes while the plane was being towed away.

==Lyon Air Museum==

Lyon Air Museum, founded by Major General William Lyon in 2009, is located in a hangar on the west side of the airport. It focuses particularly on World War II military aircraft and vehicles. The museum hosts the Collings Foundation, an annual flight experience program, every spring, allowing the public the opportunity to fly in a historic Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress or Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The air museum features a rotating selection of antique cars from General Lyon&#x27;s personal collection every year for a limited time. Past features include a collection of the General&#x27;s Duesenbergs and Packard collections.

==Climate==
The area around John Wayne Airport has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) characteristic of coastal Southern California.

<text>Potassium bromide (KBr) is a salt, widely used as an anticonvulsant and a sedative in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with over-the-counter use extending to 1975 in the US. Its action is due to the bromide ion (sodium bromide is equally effective). Potassium bromide is used as a veterinary drug, in antiepileptic medication for dogs.
Under standard conditions, potassium bromide is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water; it is not soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to the properties of the potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical effect of all soluble potassium salts).

==Chemical properties==
Potassium bromide, a typical ionic salt, is fully dissociated and near pH 7 in aqueous solution. It serves as a source of bromide ions. This reaction is important for the manufacture of silver bromide for photographic film:

Aqueous bromide also forms complexes when reacted with some metal halides such as copper(II) bromide:

==Preparation==
A traditional method for the manufacture of KBr is the reaction of potassium carbonate with an iron(III, II) bromide, , made by treating scrap iron under water with excess bromine:

==Applications==

===Medical and veterinary===
The anticonvulsant properties of potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock at a meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for epilepsy. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation. Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day). By the beginning of the 20th century the generic word had become so widely associated with being sedate that bromide came to mean a dull, sedate person or a boring platitude uttered by such a person.

There was not a better epilepsy drug until phenobarbital in 1912. The British Army has historically been claimed to lace soldiers&#x27; tea with bromide to quell sexual arousal and in the Victorian era prisoners in England were compulsorily dosed with the chemical.

Bromide compounds, especially sodium bromide, remained in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as the original formulation of Bromo-Seltzer) in the US until 1975, when bromides were outlawed in all over-the-counter medicines, due to chronic toxicity. Bromide&#x27;s exceedingly long half life in the body made it difficult to dose without side effects. Medical use of bromides for humans in the US was discontinued at this time, as many better and shorter-acting sedatives were known by then.

Potassium bromide is still used in veterinary medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. Why bromides should cause such inflammation in cats, but not in dogs is not clear.

The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able as a matter of routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test.

Potassium bromide is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans to control seizures. In Germany, it is still approved as an antiepileptic drug for humans, particularly children and adolescents. These indications include severe forms of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, early-childhood-related tonic–clonic seizures, and also severe myoclonic seizures during childhood. Adults who have reacted positively to the drug during childhood/adolescence may continue treatment. Potassium bromide tablets are sold under the brand name &quot;Dibro-Be mono&quot; (Rx-only). The drug has almost complete bioavailability, but the bromide ion has a relatively long half life of 12 days in the blood, making bromide salts difficult to adjust and dose. Bromide is not known to interfere with the absorption or excretion of any other anticonvulsant, though it does have strong interactions with chloride in the body, the normal body uptake and excretion of which strongly influences bromide&#x27;s excretion.

The therapeutic index (ratio of effectiveness to toxicity) for bromide is small. As with other antiepileptics, sometimes even therapeutic doses (3 to 5 grams per day, taking 6 to 8 weeks to reach stable levels) may give rise to intoxication. Often indistinguishable from &#x27;expected&#x27; side-effects, these include:

*&quot;Bromism&quot; These are central nervous system reactions. They may include:
**depression,
**lethargy, somnolence (from daytime sleepiness to coma)
**loss of appetite and cachexia, nausea/emesis with exicosis (loss of body fluid)
**loss of reflexes or pathologic reflexes
**clonic seizures
**tremor
**ataxia
**loss of neural sensitivity
**paresis
**cerebral edema with associated headache and papilledema of the eyes
**delirium: confusion, abnormal speech, loss of concentration and memory, aggressiveness
**psychosis

*Acne-form dermatitis and other forms of skin disease may also be seen, as well as mucous hypersecretion in the lungs. Asthma and rhinitis may worsen. Rarely, tongue disorder, aphthous stomatitis, bad breath, and constipation occur.

===Optics===
Potassium bromide is transparent from the near ultraviolet to long-wave infrared wavelengths (0.25-25 μm) and has no significant optical absorption lines in its high transmission region.
It is used widely as infrared optical windows and components for general spectroscopy because of its wide spectral range. In infrared spectroscopy, samples are analyzed by grinding with powdered potassium bromide and pressing into a disc. Alternatively, samples may be analyzed as a liquid film (neat, as a solution, or in a mull with Nujol) between two polished potassium bromide discs.

Due to its high solubility and hygroscopic nature it must be kept in a dry environment. The refractive index is about 1.55 at 1.0 μm.

===Photography===
In addition to manufacture of silver bromide, potassium bromide is used as a restrainer in black and white developer formulas. It improves differentiation between exposed and unexposed crystals of silver halide, and thus reduces fog.

<text>Giorgio Bassani (Bologna, 4 March 1916 – Rome, 13 April 2000) was an Italian novelist, poet, essayist, editor, and international intellectual.

==Biography==
Bassani was born in Bologna into a prosperous Jewish family of Ferrara, where he spent his childhood with his mother Dora, father Enrico (a doctor), brother Paolo, and sister Jenny. In 1934 he completed his studies at his secondary school, the liceo classico &quot;L. Ariosto&quot; in Ferrara. The high school&#x27;s historical archive contains many documents and photos concerning his young life, which are displayed in the atrium that they dedicated to him. Music had been his first great passion and he considered a career as a pianist; however, literature soon became the focus of his artistic interests.

In 1935 he enrolled in the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bologna. Commuting to lectures by train (third class) from Ferrara, he studied under the art historian Roberto Longhi. His ideal of the &quot;free intellectual&quot; was the liberal historian and philosopher Benedetto Croce. Despite the anti-Semitic race laws which were introduced in 1938, he was able to graduate in 1939, writing a thesis on the nineteenth-century writer, journalist, radical and lexicographer Niccolò Tommaseo. As a Jew in 1939, however, work opportunities were now limited and he became a schoolteacher in the Jewish School of Ferrara in via Vignatagliata.

In 1940, his first book, &quot;Una città di pianura&quot; (&quot;A City of the Plain&quot;), was published under the pseudonym &quot;Giacomo Marchi&quot; in order to evade the race laws. He chose the name of Dora&#x27;s brother, Giacomo Minerbi, and the surname of his maternal grandmother, Emma Marchi. During this period, along with friends he had made in Ferrara&#x27;s intellectual circle, he became a clandestine political activist.
His activity in the anti-fascist resistance led to his arrest in May 1943; he was released on 26 July, the day after Benito Mussolini was ousted from power.

A little over a week later he married Valeria Sinigallia, whom he had met playing tennis. They moved to Florence for a brief period, living under assumed names, then at the end of the year, to Rome, where he spent the rest of his life. His first volume of poems, &quot;Storie dei poveri amanti e altri versi&quot;, appeared in 1944; a second, &quot;Te lucis ante&quot;, followed in 1947. He edited the literary review &quot;Botteghe oscure&quot; for Princess Marguerite Caetani from its founding in 1948 until it ceased publication in 1960.

In 1953, &quot;La passeggiata prima di cena&quot; appeared and in 1954, &quot;Gli ultimi anni di Clelia Trotti&quot;. In the same year, he became editor of &quot;Paragone&quot;, a journal founded by Longhi and his wife, Anna Banti. Bassani&#x27;s writings reached a wider audience in 1956 with the publication of the Premio Strega-winning book of short stories, &quot;Cinque storie ferraresi&quot; (the five stories are &quot;Lida Mantovani&quot;, &quot;La passeggiata prima di cena&quot;, &quot;Una lapide in via Mazzini&quot;, &quot;Gli ultimi anni di Clelia Trotti&quot;, and &quot;Una notte del &#x27;43&quot;).

As an editorial director of Feltrinelli, Bassani was responsible for the posthumous publication in 1958 of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa&#x27;s &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot;, a novel which had been rejected by Elio Vittorini at Mondadori, and Einaudi. It became one of the great successes of post-war Italian literature. Bassani&#x27;s enthusiastic editing of the text, following instructions from (daughter of Benedetto), who had offered him the manuscript, later became controversial; however, recent editions have been published which follow the manuscript more closely.

Also in 1958, Bassani&#x27;s novel &quot;Gli occhiali d&#x27;oro&quot; (made into a film in 1987) was published, an examination, in part, of the marginalisation of Jews and homosexuals. Together with stories from &quot;Cinque storie ferraresi&quot; (reworked and under the new title &quot;Dentro le mura&quot; (1973)), it was to form part of a series of works known collectively as &quot;Il romanzo di Ferrara,&quot; which explored the city, with its Christian and Jewish elements, its perspectives and its landscapes. The series includes: &quot;Il giardino dei Finzi-Contini&quot; (The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, 1962, Premio Viareggio prizewinner); &quot;Dietro la porta&quot; (1964); &quot;L&#x27;airone&quot; (1968) and &quot;L&#x27;odore del fieno&quot; (1972). These works realistically document the Italian Jewish community under Fascism in a style that manifests the difficulties of searching for truth in the meanderings of memory and moral conscience. In 1960 one of his short stories (&quot;Una notte del &#x27;43&quot;, from &quot;Cinque storie ferraresi&quot;) was adapted as the film &quot;Long Night in 1943&quot;. A stage adaptation of &quot;The Garden of the Finzi-Continis&quot; by opera composer Ricky Ian Gordon is set to premiere in January 2022. It is a co-production of National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene and the New York City Opera.

From 1965 to 1980, Giorgio Bassani was the president of the organization Italia Nostra.

Bassani died in 2000 and was buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Ferrara, the same place where he located the graves of the family Finzi-Contini. He was survived by his estranged wife Valeria and their two children, Paola (born 1 September 1945) and Enrico (born 29 June 1949). He had been with his companion Portia Prebys since shortly after they met in 1977. The city of Ferrara decided to commemorate his life by giving his name to the Communal Library and the Urban Park in the Northern part of the city.

Bassani received the , the Strega, the Campiello, the Viareggio and the Nelly Sachs prizes. He collaborated on several screenplays.

<doc id="250462" wikidata="Q8688" url="?curid=250462" title="San Francisco International Airport">
<text>San Francisco International Airport is the primary international airport for the San Francisco Bay Area in the U.S. state of California. Owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco, the airport has a San Francisco mailing address and ZIP Code, although it is situated in an unincorporated area of neighboring San Mateo County, approximately southeast of San Francisco.

SFO is the largest airport in the Bay Area and the second-busiest in the US State of California, following Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). In 2023, it ranked as the 13th-busiest airport in the United States and the 29th-busiest in the world by passenger traffic. It is a hub for United Airlines, acting as the airline&#x27;s primary transpacific gateway, and as a major maintenance facility. Additionally, SFO functions as a hub for Alaska Airlines.

==History==
The City and County of San Francisco first leased at the present airport site on March 15, 1927, for what was then to be a temporary and experimental airport project. San Francisco held a dedication ceremony at the airfield, officially named the Mills Field Municipal Airport of San Francisco, on May 7, 1927, on the 150-acre cow pasture. The land was leased from the Mills Estate in an agreement made with Ogden L. Mills who oversaw the large tracts of property originally acquired by his grandfather, the banker Darius O. Mills. San Francisco purchased the property and the surrounding area expanding the site to beginning in August 1930. The airport&#x27;s name was officially changed to San Francisco Airport in 1931 upon the purchase of the land. &quot;International&quot; was added at the end of World War II as overseas service rapidly expanded.

===Early operations===
The earliest scheduled carriers at the airport included Western Air Express, Maddux Air Lines, and Century Pacific Lines. United Airlines was formed in 1934 and quickly became the key carrier at the airport, with Douglas DC-3 service to Los Angeles and New York beginning in January 1937. A new passenger terminal opened in 1937, built with Public Works Administration funding. The March 1939 Official Aviation Guide shows 18 airline departures on weekdays—seventeen United flights and one TWA flight. The August 1952 chart shows runway 1L 7,000 feet long, 1R 7,750 feet, 28L 6,500 feet, and 28R 8,870 feet.

In addition to United, Pacific Seaboard Air Lines flew between San Francisco and Los Angeles in 1933; the Bellanca CH-300s flew San Francisco–San Jose–Salinas–Monterey–Paso Robles–San Luis Obispo–Santa Maria–Santa Barbara–Los Angeles. Competition with United led Pacific Seaboard to move all of its operations to the eastern U.S., and rename itself Chicago and Southern Air Lines (C&amp;S). It became a large domestic and international air carrier. Chicago &amp; Southern was acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines in 1953, giving Delta its first international routes. Delta used the route authority inherited from C&amp;S to fly one of its first international services operated with Convair 880 jet aircraft from San Francisco to Montego Bay, Jamaica, and Caracas, Venezuela, via intermediate stops in Dallas and New Orleans in 1962.

===World War II===
During World War II, the airport was used as a Coast Guard base and Army Air Corps training and staging base. The base was called Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Mills Field and Coast Guard Air Station, San Francisco. Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), which had operated international flying boat service from Treasure Island, had to move its Pacific and Alaska seaplane operations to SFO in 1944 after Treasure Island was expropriated for use as a military base. Pan Am began service from SFO after World War II with five weekly flights to Honolulu, one of which continued to Canton Island, Fiji, New Caledonia, and Auckland.

===International operations===
The first service by foreign carriers was on Australian National Airways (ANA) Douglas DC-4s flown by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines: Sydney–Auckland–Fiji–Kanton Island–Honolulu–San Francisco–Vancouver, BC. The first flight left Australia on September 15, 1946. In 1947 Pan American World Airways began its &quot;round the world&quot; flights from SFO to Guam, Japan, the Philippines, China and other countries; Pan Am also flew to Sydney from SFO. The year 1947 saw the start of United Airlines Douglas DC-6 flights to Hawaii and Philippine Airlines flights to Manila.

TWA began flying Lockheed Constellations (L-1649A&#x27;s) nonstop to London Heathrow and Paris Orly in 1957. In 1954 Qantas took over the ANA/BCPA route from SFO to Sydney; starting in 1959 their Boeing 707s flew to Sydney via Honolulu and Nadi, Fiji, and in the other direction to New York and London. Pan Am scheduled Boeing 707-320s from Tokyo nonstop to SFO (winter only at first) starting in 1960–61; the westbound nonstops had to await the longer range Boeing 707-320B. British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC, a predecessor of British Airways) arrived in 1957; in 1960 its Bristol Britannias flew London–New York City–San Francisco–Honolulu–Wake Island–Tokyo–Hong Kong as part of BOAC&#x27;s around-the-world service. By 1961 BOAC had replaced the Britannias with Boeing 707s that did not require the fuel stop at the Wake Island Airfield. Japan Airlines (JAL) arrived at SFO in 1954; in 1961 it was flying Douglas DC-8s San Francisco–Honolulu–Tokyo. In 1961 Lufthansa had begun serving SFO with Boeing 707s flying San Francisco–Montreal Dorval Airport–Paris Orly Airport–Frankfurt three days a week. Lufthansa operated Boeing 720Bs on this routing in 1963 along with Boeing 707s to Frankfurt via Montreal and London Heathrow Airport. Pan Am/Panagra service from SFO to South America was taken over in the late 1960s by Braniff International, which operated Douglas DC-8-62s to SFO after Braniff&#x27;s acquisition of Panagra. In 1970 CP Air (formerly Canadian Pacific Air Lines) Boeing 737-200s flew nonstop to Vancouver, BC, and on to Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.

===Domestic expansion===
The first nonstops to the U.S. east coast were United Douglas DC-7s in 1954. The airport&#x27;s new Terminal Building opened on August 27, 1954. The large display of aircraft including a Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber, was a marvel for its time. The building became the Central Terminal with the addition of the South Terminal and the North Terminal and was heavily rebuilt as the International Terminal in 1984 and then modified again as the current Terminal 2. Domestically, the April 1957 Official Airline Guide (OAG) lists 71 scheduled weekday departures on United (plus ten flights a week to Honolulu), 22 on Western Airlines, 19 on Southwest Airways (which was later renamed Pacific Air Lines), 12 on Trans World Airlines (TWA), seven on American Airlines and three on Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA). As for international flights, Pan American had 21 departures a week, Japan Airlines (JAL) had five, and Qantas also had five.

===Southwest/Pacific/Air West===

Southwest Airways began flying scheduled passenger operations from SFO in 1946 with war surplus C-47s, the military version of the Douglas DC-3. In the late 1950s, Southwest Airways changed its name to Pacific Air Lines, which was based at SFO.

In 1959, Pacific Air Lines began flying new Fairchild F-27s from SFO and by 1966 was flying new Boeing 727-100s from the airport. Pacific used the 727 to introduce the first jet service from San Francisco to several cities in California including Bakersfield, Eureka/Arcata, Fresno, Lake Tahoe, Monterey and Santa Barbara.

In 1968 Pacific merged with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West, which also had its headquarters at SFO. West Coast Airlines had served SFO mainly with Douglas DC-9-10s and Fairchild F-27s to Oregon and Washington states. In 1970, Air West was acquired by Howard Hughes who renamed the airline Hughes Airwest, which continued to be based at the airport where it also operated a hub. By the late 1970s, the airline was operating an all-jet fleet of Boeing 727-200, Douglas DC-9-10, and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners serving an extensive route network in the western U.S. with flights to Mexico and western Canada as well. Hughes Airwest was eventually acquired by Minneapolis-based Republic Airlines (1979–1986) in 1980 and the airline&#x27;s headquarters office at SFO was closed.

===Jet age===
The jet age arrived at SFO in March 1959 when TWA introduced Boeing 707-131s nonstop to New York Idlewild Airport (which was renamed JFK Airport in 1963). United then constructed a large maintenance facility in San Francisco for its new Douglas DC-8s, which were also flying nonstop to New York. In July 1959 the first jetway bridge was installed at SFO, one of the first in the United States. On the cover of January 3, 1960, American Airlines timetable contained this message: &quot;NOW! 707 JET FLAGSHIP SERVICE – NONSTOP SAN FRANCISCO – NEW YORK: 2 FLIGHTS DAILY&quot; Also in 1960, Western Airlines was operating &quot;champagne flights&quot; with Boeing 707s and Lockheed L-188 Electras to Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego and Portland, Oregon.

In 1961 the airport had helicopter service on San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines (known as SFO Helicopter Airlines, and as SFO Helicopter) with 68 flights a day. Helicopters flew from SFO to downtown heliports in San Francisco and Oakland, to a new heliport near the Berkeley Marina and to Oakland Airport (OAK). In its timetable, SFO Helicopter Airlines, which was based at the airport, described its rotorcraft as &quot;modern, jet turbine powered Sikorsky S-62 ten passenger amphibious helicopters&quot;.

By 1962 Delta Air Lines was flying Convair 880s to SFO on one its first international jet services, San Francisco–Dallas Love Field–New Orleans–Montego Bay, Jamaica–Caracas, Venezuela. Also in 1962, National Airlines began flying Douglas DC-8s San Francisco–Houston Hobby Airport–New Orleans–Miami. SFO was among the first airports in the United States to install moving walkways inside a terminal. A set opened on May 20, 1964, in Concourse B and was the world&#x27;s longest moving walkways at the time.

===Service in California===
By 1960, all Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) flights out of SFO were operated with Lockheed L-188 Electras nonstop to Los Angeles (LAX) and Burbank (BUR) with some flights continuing to San Diego. In summer 1962 PSA had 14 departures a day Monday through Thursday to southern California, 21 departures on Friday and 22 on Sunday. In 1965 PSA was operating new Boeing 727-100s which were joined in 1967 by Boeing 727-200s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s. In 1974 PSA was flying two wide body Lockheed L-1011 TriStars. After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, PSA expanded outside of California.

In 1967, another intrastate airline joined PSA at SFO: Air California, flying Lockheed L-188 Electras nonstop to Orange County Airport (SNA, now John Wayne Airport). Like PSA, Air California (later renamed AirCal) eventually became an all-jet airline and expanded outside of California. AirCal was merged into American Airlines while PSA was merged into USAir (later renamed US Airways which in turn eventually merged with American Airlines).

===Earthquake and planned Bay fill expansion===

The airport closed following the Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17, 1989, reopening the following morning. Minor damage to the runways was quickly repaired.

In 1989, a master plan and Environmental Impact Report were prepared to guide development over the next two decades.
During the boom of the 1990s and the dot-com boom SFO became the sixth busiest airport in the world, but since 2001, when the boom ended, SFO has fallen out of the top 20. United Express turboprops were scheduled 60 minutes apart to the shuttle connecting passengers between SFO and nearby San Jose International Airport during the boom era. United Groundlink supplemented this service with alternate 60-minute frequencies.
A $2.4 billion International Terminal Complex opened in December 2000, replacing Terminal 2 (known then as the International Terminal). The new International Terminal includes the San Francisco Airport Commission Aviation Museum and Library and the Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum, as part of the SFO Museum. SFO&#x27;s long-running museum exhibition program, now called SFO Museum, won unprecedented accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums in 1999.

SFO experiences delays (known as &quot;flow control&quot;) in overcast weather when only two of the airport&#x27;s four runways can be used at a time because the centerlines of the parallel runway sets (01R/01L and 28R/28L) are only apart. Airport planners advanced proposals that would extend the airport&#x27;s runways by adding up to of fill to San Francisco Bay and increase their separation by up to in 1998 to accommodate arrivals and departures during periods of low visibility. Other proposals included three floating runways, each approximately long and wide. The airport would be required by law to restore Bay land elsewhere in the Bay Area to offset the fill. One mitigation proposal would have the airport purchase and restore the of South Bay wetlands owned by Cargill Salt to compensate for the new fill. These expansion proposals met resistance from environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, fearing damage to the habitat of animals near the airport, recreational degradation (such as windsurfing) and bay water quality.

State Senator John L. Burton introduced SB 1562 on February 18, 2000, to bypass the environmental impact study that would normally be required for a large project like the proposed Bay fill and mitigation in order to expedite construction. SB 1562 was signed into law on September 29, 2000. A study commissioned by the airport and released in 2001 stated that alternatives to airport expansion, such as redirecting traffic to other regional airports (Oakland or San Jose), capping the number of flights, or charging higher landing fees at selected times of the day would result in higher fares and poorer service. However, the proposal to build new runways on Bay fill continued to attract opposition from environmental groups and local residents. The airport expansion cost was estimated at in 1998, rising to a year later, including an estimate of for the Cargill wetlands purchase and restoration.

The delays during poor weather (among other reasons) caused some airlines, especially low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines, to shift all of their services from SFO to the Oakland and San Jose airports. However, Southwest eventually returned to San Francisco in 2007.

===BART to SFO===
A long-planned extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system to the airport opened on June 22, 2003, allowing passengers to board BART trains at the international or domestic terminals and have direct rail transportation to downtown San Francisco, Oakland, and the East Bay. On February 24, 2003, the AirTrain people mover opened, transporting passengers between terminals, parking lots, the BART station, and the rental car center on small automatic trains.

===Recent developments===
SFO became the base of operations for start-up airline Virgin America, with service to over 20 destinations. On October 4, 2007, an Airbus A380 jumbo jet made its first visit to SFO. On July 14, 2008, SFO was voted Best International Airport in North America for 2008 in the World Airports Survey by Skytrax. The following year on June 9, Skytrax announced SFO as the second-best International Airport in North America in the 2009 World Airports Survey, losing to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.
In response to longstanding FAA concerns that the airport&#x27;s air traffic control tower, located atop Terminal 2, could not withstand a major earthquake, on July 9, 2012, crews broke ground for a new torch-shaped tower. The new tower is located between Terminals 1 and 2, and the base of the tower building contains passages between the two terminals for passengers both pre- and post-security screening, which dictated the narrow tower base. Originally scheduled for completion in the summer of 2016 at a cost of $102 million, the new tower began operations on October 15, 2016.

SFO was one of several US airports that operated the Registered Traveler program from April 2007 until funding ended in June 2009. This program let travelers who had paid for pre-screening pass through security checkpoints quickly. Baggage and passenger screening is operated by Covenant Aviation Security, a Transportation Security Administration contractor, nicknamed &quot;Team SFO&quot;. SFO was the first airport in the United States to integrate in-line baggage screening into its baggage handling system and has been a model for other airports since the September 11 attacks in 2001.

In September 2018, SFO announced plans to use sustainable fuels after signing an agreement with fuel suppliers, airlines, and agencies. As part of the agreement, Shell and SkyNRG began supplying sustainable aviation fuel to KLM, SAS, and Finnair flights operating out of SFO.

Like most other airports, SFO sustained a massive decline in traffic in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The only upside was that the decline reduced traffic to levels easily handled in all weather conditions. In 2022, SFO was ranked no. 1 by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on its list of Best Large U.S. Airports, on which the airport was ranked no. 1 for both reliability and convenience.

On August 6, 2024, SFO unveiled a new logo and brand identity, retiring its current logo after 24 years of use. The logo will be phased in over several years.

==Runways==
The airport covers at an elevation of . It has four asphalt runways, arranged in two intersecting sets of parallel runways:
* Runway 01L/19R: , surface: asphalt, has approved GPS approaches
* Runway 01R/19L: , surface: asphalt, ILS/DME equipped, and has approved GPS/VOR approaches
* Runway 10L/28R: , surface: asphalt, Category III ILS/DME equipped, and has approved GPS approaches
* Runway 10R/28L: , surface: asphalt, ILS/DME equipped, and has approved GPS approaches

Runways are named for their magnetic heading, to the nearest ten degrees; hence the runways at 14° from magnetic north are 01L/01R, and the runways at 284° are 28R/28L. The layout of the parallel runways (1L/1R and 28R/28L) was established in the 1950s, and have a separation (centerline to centerline) of only .

During normal operations (approximately 81% of the time), domestic departures use Runways 1L and 1R for departure while overseas international departures and all arrivals use Runways 28L and 28R, taking advantage of the prevailing west-northwesterly wind coming through the San Bruno Gap. During periods of heavy winds or if operations at Oakland International Airport conflict with SFO departures (approximately 15% of the time), Runways 1L and 1R cannot be used, and so all departures and all arrivals use Runways 28L and 28R. These configurations are known collectively as the &quot;West Plan&quot;, and accommodate arrivals at a rate of up to 60 aircraft per hour.

When using 28L and 28R for landing, aircraft join the final approach at DUMBA waypoint next to the Dumbarton Bridge. In most circumstances, aircraft from the north or west start the approach from Daly City, California, descend along the east or west shoreline of the San Francisco Peninsula, and join the final after bypassing waypoints MENLO near Menlo Park and DUMBA; aircraft from the south join the final through MENLO and DUMBA after flying over the Santa Cruz Mountains; aircraft from the east join the final approach after bypassing Milpitas, California.

Under visual flight rules, aircraft may safely land side-by-side essentially simultaneously on 28L and 28R while maintaining visual separation. When the visual approach is compromised, the &quot;West Plan&quot; is maintained with a modification to allow aircraft landing on 28L to use Instrument Landing System (ILS) while the aircraft landing on 28R takes an offset course, monitored via high scan rate ground radar, to maintain a lateral spacing greater than 750 ft until the aircraft can maintain visual separation. Visual separation typically occurs once the aircraft has descended below the cloud deck at an altitude of 2,100 feet (640 m). This is known as the Precision Runway Monitor/Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approach and reduces the capacity to 36 arriving aircraft per hour. In poor visibility conditions, FAA instrument approach rules require aircraft to maintain lateral separation of 4,300 feet (1,300 m), meaning only one runway may be used, reducing the capacity of SFO to 25–30 arriving aircraft per hour.

During rainstorms (approximately 4% of the time), the prevailing winds shift to a south-southeasterly direction, and departing aircraft use Runways 10L and 10R, and arriving aircraft use Runways 19L and 19R. This configuration is known as the &quot;Southeast Plan&quot;.

On rare occasions (less than one day per year, on average), wind conditions dictate other runway configurations, including departures and landings on Runways 10L and 10R, departures and landings on Runways 1L and 1R, and departures on Runways 19L and 19R and landings on Runways 28L and 28R.

==Based aircraft and operations==
In the year ending February 29, 2024, SFO had 385,543 aircraft operations, an average of 1,056 per day. This consisted of 90% scheduled commercial, 7% air taxi, 2% general aviation and &lt;1% military. There were 11 aircraft based at SFO, 6 helicopter and 5 military aircraft.

==Aircraft noise abatement==
SFO was one of the first airports to implement a Fly Quiet Program, which grades airlines on their performance on noise abatement procedures while flying in and out of SFO. The Jon C. Long Fly Quiet Program was started by the Aircraft Noise Abatement Office to encourage airlines to operate as quietly as possible at SFO.

SFO was one of the first U.S. airports to conduct a residential sound abatement retrofitting program. Established by the FAA in the early 1980s, this program evaluated the cost-effectiveness of reducing interior sound levels for homes near the airport, within the 65 CNEL noise contour. The program made use of a noise computer model to predict improvement in specific residential interiors for a variety of noise control strategies. This pilot program was conducted for a neighborhood in South San Francisco and success was achieved in all of the homes analyzed. The costs turned out to be modest, and the post-construction interior sound level tests confirmed the predictions for noise abatement. To date over $153 million has been spent to insulate more than 15,000 homes in the neighboring cities of Daly City, Pacifica, San Bruno, and South San Francisco.

==Terminals==
The airport has four terminals (1, 2, 3, and International) and seven concourses with a total of 120 gates arranged alphabetically in a counterclockwise ring. Terminal 1 (B and C gates), Terminal 2 (D gates), and Terminal 3 (E and F gates) handle domestic and precleared flights. The International Terminal (A and G gates) handles international flights and some domestic flights.

Historically, the oldest terminal building still standing is Terminal 2, which was originally completed in 1954 as the Central Terminal with four concourses (Piers B, C, D, and E, lettered sequentially from north to south). Terminal 1 was added as the South Terminal in 1963 with Piers F/FF (Pier F had two satellite rotundas) and G, and Pier E was reassigned to the South Terminal upon its completion. International traffic was routed through Pier G, and a new Rotunda G was completed in 1974 to expand Pier G. Terminal 3 was added as the North Terminal in 1979 with Pier A. Also, once the North Terminal was completed in 1979, the piers were renamed counterclockwise, with letter designations corresponding to present-day Boarding Areas, starting with Pier A (present-day Boarding Area A, originally Pier G), Pier B (present-day Boarding Area B, originally Pier F/FF), Pier C (present-day Boarding Area C, originally Pier E), and Pier F (present-day Boarding Area F, originally Pier A). A new Pier E was added to the North Terminal in 1981 approximately where the old Pier B stood, and the Central Terminal was rebuilt with a single pier (D) to serve international flights in 1983, until a new International Terminal opened in 2000. Since then, the terminals were renamed with numbers in 2001, and the older terminals are in the process of renovation.

A rebuild of Terminal 2 (D gates, formerly the Central Terminal) was completed in 2011, followed by the completion of the rebuild of Terminal 3 East (E gates) in 2015. The rebuild of Terminal 1 (B gates) was completed in 2024. A rebuild of Terminal 3 West (F gates) commenced in 2024, with full completion expected by 2029.

===Airside connectors===
There are airside connectors at SFO that enable passengers to move between adjacent terminal buildings while staying within the secure area. Since June 17, 2024 connectors are available between the A gates of International Terminal to Terminal 1, Terminal 1 to Terminal 2, Terminal 2 to Terminal 3, and Terminal 3 to the G gates of the International Terminal. There is no connector directly between the International Terminal A and G gates.

===Terminal 1===


Formerly known as the &quot;South Terminal&quot;, Harvey Milk Terminal 1 is composed of Boarding Area B, which currently has 26 gates (gates B2-B27), and Boarding Area C, which has 10 gates (gates C1, C3-C11). A third boarding area, Rotunda A, was demolished in early 2006, as its functions had been taken over by the new International Terminal.

The South Terminal, which cost , was initially dedicated on . The terminal was designed by Welton Becket and Associates. When it opened, the South Terminal had three piers: Pier G (for international flights, approximately at the same location as the present-day Boarding Area (B/A) A in the International Terminal), Pier F/FF (used by Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Western Airlines, later renamed B/A B), and Pier E (used by American Airlines; originally part of Terminal 2, approximately at the present-day B/A C). The three-level Rotunda A addition was completed in 1974 at the end of Pier G. When the North Terminal was completed in 1979, Pier G was renamed Pier A, with the other piers renamed in a counterclockwise direction proceeding from the new Pier A. International flights were moved to the rebuilt Central Terminal (Terminal 2) in 1983, and then to the new International Terminal in 2000.

The South Terminal underwent a renovation designed by Howard A. Friedman and Associates, Marquis Associates and Wong &amp; Brocchini that was completed in 1988. Terminal 1 then underwent a project to modernize the concourse and add gates; the project broke ground on June 29, 2016. The phase of the project to expand Boarding Area B includes the demolition of the old TWA hangar, the demolition of the two rotundas, and the relocation of two taxiways. The multi-phase project yielded a total of 27 gates when completed in 2024 including a secure Federal Inspection Services (FIS) connector to the existing customs facilities in the International Terminal. This effectively added six new gates that can handle international arrivals. A renovation of Boarding Area C was expected to begin after the completion of work on Boarding Area B, but there were no current plans as of September 2024.

In April 2018, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and mayor Mark Farrell approved and signed legislation renaming Terminal 1 after deceased gay rights activist and former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors Harvey Milk, and planned to install artwork memorializing him. This followed a previous attempt to rename the entire airport after him, which was turned down. Following the art and photo installation, the renamed terminal was opened to the media and public for preview tours in advance of its official opening on July 23, 2019. Harvey Milk Terminal 1 is the world&#x27;s first airport terminal named after a leader of the LGBTQ community.

The first nine gates at the newly reconstructed Boarding Area B opened on July 23, 2019, with Southwest Airlines and JetBlue becoming the first tenants. In late-April 2020, the terminal&#x27;s new lobby opened, with new ticket counters for Southwest and JetBlue, and a new permanent exhibit honoring Milk. On May 12, 2020, in conjunction with the launch of nine new gates at Boarding Area B (B19-B27), American Airlines moved into the new facility, with new ticket counters, baggage systems, and a new Admirals Club lounge. Seven gates (B2-B5, B10-B11, B15-B16) in the new terminal opened on May 25, 2021.

In 2022, Hawaiian Airlines and WestJet moved a few of their departures into the B gates, but check-in counters and baggage claim remain in International Terminal A. In June 2024, Alaska Airlines moved all of its operations from Terminal 2 into Harvey Milk Terminal 1, in order to be closer to their Oneworld partner American Airlines and opened an Alaska Lounge in the terminal in July 2024. Two gates (B3 and C1) also opened that month. In December 2024, Hawaiian Airlines moved its check-in counters and baggage claim from the International Terminal A to the Harvey Milk Terminal 1 as part of its merger with Alaska Airlines.

JetBlue operates two gates preferentially (B3 and B6), while Southwest operates five gates preferentially (B9, B12, B13, B14, and B17). American operates six of the nine new gates preferentially (B22-B27). Alaska Airlines operates ten gates in the terminal preferentially (B7-8, B10-11, B15-16, and B18-21). Three gates (B2, B4, and B5) are not assigned preferentially to any airline.

Since Terminal 1 was completed on June 17, 2024, Boarding Area C has been redesignated as part of Terminal 1. Delta Airlines moved its ticket counter to Terminal 1 on October 8, 2024.

===Terminal 2===

Formerly known as the &quot;Central Terminal&quot;, Terminal 2 is composed of Boarding Area D, which has 14 gates (D1, D3-D12 and D14-D16). Gates D2 and D13 do not exist as the numbers have been reserved for future development. Between June 23, 2020 and October 8, 2024, Boarding Area C was also considered part of Terminal 2.

Terminal 2 opened in 1954 as the main airport terminal. After a drastic rebuilding designed by Gensler, it replaced Rotunda A as SFO&#x27;s international terminal in 1983 until it was closed for renovation after the current international terminal opened in 2000. The initial plan was to convert Terminal 2 for domestic travel and reopen it by fall 2001, but the loss of passenger traffic after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 put those plans on hold. The upper levels continued to be used as office spaces and for the airport&#x27;s medical clinic, and the control tower remained in use.

On May 12, 2008, a renovation project was announced that included a new control tower, the use of green materials, a seismic retrofit, and an expansion from ten to fourteen gates. The terminal reopened for commercial travel on April 14, 2011, with Virgin America (later Alaska Airlines) and American Airlines sharing the new 14-gate common-use facility. Approximately a week earlier, on , Virgin America&#x27;s ceremonial flight VX2001 was the first to arrive at the renovated Terminal 2, an Airbus A320 bearing founder Richard Branson with other invited celebrity guests, such as Buzz Aldrin, Rachel Hunter, and Gavin Newsom. VX2001 had rendezvoused with White Knight Two/SpaceShipTwo over Point Reyes before making a side-by-side landing.
The newly renovated terminal also designed by Gensler features permanent art installations from Janet Echelman, Kendall Buster, Norie Sato, Charles Sowers, and Walter Kitundu. Transition zones (the immediate post-security line area for &quot;passenger recomposure&quot;) and exit areas (where disembarking passengers may be greeted) were designed with generous space. Terminal 2 set accolades by being the first U.S. airport to achieve LEED Gold status. Paolo Lucchesi, a local food critic, noted the sustainable food and dining program featuring local vendors and sources.

Following the construction of a new control tower in 2016, the tower and the offices above the terminal were demolished and new office space was constructed in their place. On February 14, 2020, a new public, outdoor observation deck, called SkyTerrace, was opened in the new office space.

Until May 12, 2020, American&#x27;s check-in counters were consolidated to T2, but its operations were split between Boarding Area D and Boarding Area C (linked via an airside connector). Following American&#x27;s move to T1, the existing Admirals Club location was converted to an Alaska lounge, which has since closed.

Air Canada and Breeze Airways have moved into Terminal 2 during 2022-Q1. As a result, all check-ins and departures from Air Canada are no longer operating at the International Terminal. Since 2023, United Airlines has operated some flights out of Boarding Area D due to the Terminal 3 renovation project. 

===Terminal 3===

Formerly known as the &quot;North Terminal&quot;, Terminal 3 is composed of Boarding Area E with 13 gates (gates E1-E13) and Boarding Area F with 18 gates (gates F5-F22). Terminal 3 is used for United Airlines&#x27; domestic flights. Mainline United and United Express flights use both boarding areas.

This $82.44 million terminal was originally designed by San Francisco Airport Architects (a joint venture of John Carl Warnecke and Associates, Dreyfuss + Blackford Architecture, and minority architects). The groundbreaking ceremony for the North Terminal was held on April 22, 1971, and Boarding Area F opened in 1979 and Boarding Area E opened in 1981. All terminals (except the International Terminal) were redesignated by number starting October 1, 2001.

A solar roof was installed in 2007 with sufficient generating capacity to power all Terminal 3 lights during the day. American Airlines and Air Canada occupied Boarding Area E until it closed for refurbishment in 2011 under the airport&#x27;s FY 2010/11 – FY 2014/15 Capital Plan. Designed by Gensler, the renovation included architectural enhancements, structural renovations, replacement of HVAC systems, roof repair, and new carpeting. Initial modest renovation plans were replaced by a more ambitious project after the popularity of the remodeling of Terminal 2. After the completion of the project, Boarding Area E reopened on January 28, 2014, followed by Terminal 3 East on November 18. The project moved one gate from Boarding Area F to Boarding Area E to provide a total of ten aircraft parking positions at T3E. Following a 2019 renumbering of all gates at SFO, three additional gates moved from Boarding Area F to Boarding Area E, with the latter now containing 13 gates.

In 2020, airport officials postponed a planned renovation for Terminal 3 West. After a four year delay, the $2.6 billion project broke ground in 2024. It will seismically retrofit part of Terminal 3, add international arrivals capabilities to up to four gates, renovate the check-in lobby, and expand the security checkpoint. The project also includes a replacement of the &quot;bouncy&quot; moving walkway in Terminal 3 that was installed in the 1970s using one continuous section of rubber.

There are two United Clubs in Terminal 3—one near the rotunda for Boarding Area F and another at the beginning of Boarding Area E. Terminal 3 also houses the American Express Centurion Lounge, located across from Gate F2.

===International Terminal===
The International Terminal is composed of Boarding Areas A and G. Designed by Craig W. Hartman of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the terminal opened in December 2000 to replace the International Departures section of Terminal 2. It is the largest international terminal in North America, and the largest building in the world built on base isolators to protect against earthquakes. Food service focuses on quick service versions of leading San Francisco Bay Area restaurants, following other SFO terminals. Planners attempted to make the airport a destination in and of itself, not just for travelers passing through. The international terminal is a common-use facility, with all gates and all ticketing areas shared among international airlines and several domestic carriers. Common-use terminal equipment (CUTE) is used at check-in counters and gates. All international arrivals and departures are handled here (except flights from cities with customs preclearance). The International Terminal houses the airport&#x27;s BART station, adjacent to the garage leading to Boarding Area G. The SFO Medical Clinic is located next to the security screening area of Boarding Area A. All gates in this terminal have at least two jetway bridges, except gates A3 and A12, which have one. Gates A1 and A2 can accommodate two aircraft. Six of the gates are designed for the Airbus A380, making SFO one of the first airports in the world with such gates when it was built in 2000. Gate A11 has three jetways for boarding. Four other gates have two jetways fitted for A380 service.

The International Terminal completed a continuous ring of terminals, by filling in the last remaining gap to the west of then-existing terminals. Its geometry required that the terminal structure be built above the main access road, at enormous expense, including building dedicated ramps for connectivity to Highway 101. The design and construction of the international terminal was by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Del Campo &amp; Maru Architects, Michael Willis Associates, and built by Tutor Perini (main terminal building), Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum in association with Robin Chiang &amp; Company, Robert B. Wong Architects, and built by Tutor Perini (Boarding Area G), and Gerson/Overstreet Architects and built by Hensel Phelps Construction (Boarding Area A). The contracts were awarded after an architectural design competition.
Most international flights operated by Star Alliance carriers, including all United international flights and select United domestic flights, are assigned to Boarding Area G&#x27;s 14 gates (G1-G14). Most international flights operated by SkyTeam, Oneworld, and non-aligned international carriers board and deplane at Boarding Area A&#x27;s 15 gates (gates A1–A15). However, Star Alliance carriers Air India, Avianca El Salvador, Copa Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and Turkish Airlines operate out of Boarding Area A. Boarding Area A is also used by domestic carriers Frontier Airlines and Sun Country Airlines. When all gates in an airline&#x27;s designated international boarding area are full, the passengers will board or deplane from the opposite international boarding area or, in the case of Boarding Area A, the adjacent B gates. Aer Lingus, Flair Airlines, and WestJet operate from airports with United States border preclearance, allowing arriving passengers to skip the wait at customs and immigration when they arrive at SFO, and exit the airport from the departure level.

The two main designations for the International Terminal are &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;INTL&quot; (abbreviations for &quot;International&quot;). Oftentimes travel itineraries will say &quot;T-I&quot;, and this has led to instances where passengers misinterpret the &quot;I&quot; as Terminal 1, especially since both Boarding Area A and Boarding Area G are used for a limited number of domestic flights.

In 2024, the airport announced that the International Terminal would be renamed after the late senator and former mayor Dianne Feinstein. The departures main hall is already named after the late mayor Ed Lee.

==SFO Museum==

SFO Museum was created in 1980 as a collaboration between the San Francisco Airport Commission and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and was the first museum in an international airport. It was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in 1999, and contains both permanent artwork and temporary exhibitions in more than 20 galleries. The Aviation Museum and Library (officially, the San Francisco Airport Commission Aviation Library and Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum) is located in the International Terminal, featuring a model of a DC-3. Other prominent installations include works by:
* Robert Bechtle, &quot;San Francisco Nova&quot; (T3, boarding area E)
* Kendall Buster, &quot;Topograph&quot; (T2, departure lounge)
* Janet Echelman, &quot;Every Beating Second&quot; (T2, recomposure area)
* Joyce Kozloff, &quot;Bay Area Victorian&quot;, &quot;Bay Area Deco&quot;, &quot;Bay Area Funk&quot;; tile wall (IT–T1 connector)
* Seiji Kunishima, &quot;Stacking Stones&quot; (T2)
* Yayoi Kusama, &quot;High Heels for Going to Heaven&quot; (T1, b/a B)
* Ursula von Rydingsvard, &quot;Ocean Voices II&quot; (T3, E Plaza)
* Norie Sato, &quot;Air Over Under&quot; (T2, exterior)
* Larry Sultan and Mike Mandel, &quot;Waiting&quot; (IT, b/a A)
* Rufino Tamayo, &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; (IT, exterior)
* Wayne Thiebaud, &quot;18th Street Downgrade&quot; (T3, b/a E)
* James Torlakson, &quot;Behind Ted McMann&#x27;s Garage&quot; (T3, b/a E)
* Bob Zoell, &quot;BFILRYD&quot; (T3–IT connector)
Frequent travelers and airline staff have reportedly told SFO Museum officials they make it a point to arrive to the airport early in order to view the galleries.

==Ground transportation==
===Transit===
The AirTrain is a landside people-mover system that connects each terminal, the two international terminal garages, the BART station, the Grand Hyatt hotel, the airport&#x27;s Rental Car Center, and the Long-Term Parking garage. The AirTrain is fully automated and free to ride.

Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) serves the airport at San Francisco International Airport station, located west of the International Terminal. The trains connect the airport directly to San Francisco, Oakland, and numerous other cities across the San Francisco Bay Area.

San Mateo County&#x27;s transit agency, SamTrans, serves the airport with several routes. Buses stop at the arrivals/baggage claim level of the domestic terminals and in courtyard A or G in the International Terminal.

BART trains and SamTrans buses also connect San Francisco International Airport to Caltrain with a transfer at Millbrae station. Millbrae will also be the connection between SFO and California High-Speed Rail; the station will be renamed to Millbrae–SFO station on the High Speed Rail line to coincide with the dual functionality of the station.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport provided free shuttle bus service to and from the South San Francisco Ferry Terminal, connecting with San Francisco Bay Ferry services from Alameda and Oakland.

Numerous door-to-door &quot;shared ride&quot; van and hotel courtesy shuttles stop at the center transportation island on the departure level, while Marin Airporter buses and limousines are on the arrivals/baggage claim level of the airport. Charter services are also available in the courtyards.
===Car===

The airport is located on U.S. Route 101, south of downtown San Francisco. It is near the US 101 interchange with Interstate 380, a short freeway that connects US 101 with Interstate 280. Short term parking is located in the central terminal area and two international terminal garages. Long term parking is located on South Airport Blvd. and San Bruno Ave.

Passengers can also park long-term at a select number of BART stations that have parking lots, with a permit purchased online in advance.

===Taxi===
Taxis depart from designated taxi zones located at the roadway center islands, on the Arrivals/Baggage Claim Level of all terminals.

Ride app services such as Uber and Lyft are available via their respective mobile app. The designated ride app pickup area for domestic terminals is on the fifth floor of the adjacent garage. The designated pickup area for the International Terminal is on the Departures/Check-In Level roadway center island.

==Other facilities==
SFO is home to one of the largest single aircraft maintenance bases in the world with complete MRO base operations (maintenance, repair, overhaul, painting, welding, machine shop, tool and die, parts manufacturing, fabrication, engineering, and retrofitting (Boeing and Airbus certified, among others)). It serves as the principal Global MRO Base for United Airlines and serves over 40 other airlines, military customers, and aircraft lease operators.

The eastern side of the airfield is dominated by the Superbay, a maintenance hangar capable of holding four 747s. Originally constructed in the 1970s, the facility is shared by United Airlines and American Airlines.

Nippon Cargo Airlines has its San Francisco branch on the airport property.

Prior to its merger that formed AirWest, Pacific Air Lines had its corporate headquarters on the grounds of the airport. Hughes Airwest, the successor to Air West, also had its headquarters on the grounds of the airport.

The United States Coast Guard operates Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco with its ramp and buildings near the cargo terminal, operating six MH-65 Dolphin helicopters.

The United States Postal Service had an Air Mail Facility (AMF), later an International Service Center (ISC) located on Airport property.

===Wag Brigade===
On December 3, 2013, SFO launched a &quot;Wag Brigade&quot; program to bring a pack of trained therapy dogs to the terminals to calm nervous fliers and make passenger travel more enjoyable. In 2016, Lilou, a Juliana-breed therapy pig joined the Wag Brigade. Carefully selected for their temperament and airport suitability, the comfort canines wear vests that read &quot;Pet Me!&quot; which identify them.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On February 9, 1937, a United Airlines Douglas DC-3A-197 transport liner circled the airport, then crashed into the bay, killing 11 people.
* On September 12, 1951, United Airlines Flight 7030 plunged into the bay during a training exercise killing all three crew members.
* On April 20, 1953, Western Airlines Flight 366, a Douglas DC-6 on a scheduled evening crossbay flight to Oakland International Airport, crashed three minutes after departing SFO into San Francisco Bay. There were eight fatalities (4 crew, 4 passengers) of the 10 occupants on board.
* On October 29, 1953, British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines flight 304, a Douglas DC-6 en route from Sydney, Australia, with fuel stops in Auckland, New Zealand, Fiji, and Honolulu, crashed on approach to SFO into Kings Mountain in San Mateo County. All 19 passengers and crew members died.
* On February 20, 1959, a Pan American DC-7C crashed and burned on the runway. The three crew members on board survived.
* On February 3, 1963, Slick Airways Flight 40 crashed and burned after striking approach lights on runway 28R, killing the four people on board.
* On December 24, 1964, Flying Tiger Line Flight 282, a Lockheed Constellation cargo aircraft departing for New York City, crashed in the hills west of the airport, killing all three crew members on board.
* On June 28, 1965, Pan Am Flight 843, a Boeing 707, had just departed for Honolulu, Hawaii, when its #4 engine exploded, causing part of the wing and the engine itself to break off and fall into the streets below. The crew was able to extinguish the ensuing fire and land safely at the nearby Travis Air Force Base.

* On November 22, 1968, Japan Air Lines Flight 2, a DC-8-62 named the Shiga (registered as JA8032), crash-landed on final approach at 9:30 a.m. on a shallow submerged reef at the eastern tip of Coyote Point (three miles short of the runway southeast of the airport). The plane was on a trip from Tokyo to San Francisco, after making a stop in Honolulu. The pilot was experienced but misread the instruments on the DC-8, which was less than a year old. There were 107 people on the plane. There were no deaths or serious injuries. The plane was salvaged by Bigge Drayage Company soon after the crash. All luggage and fuel were removed to cut the weight and the plane was lifted onto a barge and taken to the airport for repairs. The cost of repairs was $4 million and the plane re-entered service the following April. The aircraft flew for Japan Air Lines until 1983 and then several air freight companies for 18 years until it was scrapped in December 2001.
* On July 30, 1971, Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747 (registration: N747PA, name: Clipper America), struck navigational aids at the end of runway 1R on takeoff for Tokyo. The aircraft&#x27;s landing gear and other systems were damaged. Two passengers were seriously injured by metal components of the runway approach light pier entering the cabin. The flight proceeded out over the Pacific Ocean to dump fuel to reduce weight for an emergency landing. Emergency services were deployed at the airport, and the plane returned and landed on runway 28R. During landing, the aircraft veered off the runway. There was no fire. After coming to a stop, the aircraft slowly tilted aft, coming to rest on its tail in a nose-high attitude. The forward evacuation slides were therefore in a nearly vertical position. Evacuation using these slides caused all of additional injuries, some severe. There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew members aboard. An investigation determined that the cause of the accident was erroneous information from the flight dispatcher to the crew members regarding weight and runway length.
* On July 5, 1972, Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 710, a Boeing 737-200, was hijacked by two Bulgarian immigrants demanding $800,000 and to be taken to the Soviet Union. After flying for an hour and landing back at SFO, the plane was stormed by four FBI agents. Both hijackers were killed along with one passenger. Two other passengers were injured.
* On September 13, 1972, TWA Flight 604, a Boeing 707-331C cargo plane crashed into the bay on takeoff. All three crew members survived.
* On October 8, 1984, a Clay Lacy Aviation Learjet 24 crashed shortly after takeoff after descending in a steep left-wing low-nose attitude after entering a broken cloud at 600 feet. All three occupants (two crew, and one occupant) were killed.
*On February 19, 1985, China Airlines Flight 006 made an emergency landing at the airport after a fatigued crew mishandled a single engine flameout, eventually leading to a stall and catastrophic dive that nearly led the Boeing 747SP to hit the ocean.
* On , United Airlines Flight 863 was forced to shut down an engine just after takeoff, and then nearly collided with San Bruno Mountain due to improper flight procedure. The aircraft returned safely to the airport. In response, United instituted new training procedures for its flight crews.
* In the September 11 attacks in 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was destined for San Francisco. It was hijacked by four al-Qaeda terrorists and diverted towards Washington, D.C., with the intent of crashing the plane into either The Capitol or the White House. After learning of the previous attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, the passengers attempted to regain control of the plane. The hijackers subsequently crashed the plane into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board.
* On , an arriving SkyWest Airlines Embraer EMB 120 nearly collided with a Republic Airline Embraer 170 Regional Jet at the junction of Runways 01L and 28R. After the SkyWest EMB 120 passed the Runway 28R threshold, the Republic E-170 was cleared for takeoff on 01L, in contradiction to local and FAA orders requiring the arriving aircraft to pass the intersection before clearing departing aircraft on the intersecting runway.
* On June 28, 2008, an ABX Air Boeing 767 preparing to depart with cargo caught fire and was seriously damaged. The pilots escaped uninjured. Although the airline had received a threat the week before, investigations revealed no evidence of any malicious device on board, eventually concluding the fire was caused by an electrical system malfunction.
* On September 22, 2012, a PrimeFlight catering truck accidentally drove into the wing of a parked NetJets Gulfstream V. The wing sliced into the cab of the truck, killing the 60-year-old driver.

* On July 6, 2013, Asiana Airlines Flight 214, a Boeing 777-200ER registered HL7742, crashed while landing. The crash occurred due to a combination of mistakes made by the aircraft&#x27;s flight crew. The flight crew had selected an incorrect autopilot mode when attempting to descend, followed by placing the thrust levers into &quot;idle&quot;, which disabled the autopilot from maintaining speed as the aircraft approached the seawall. Upon descending below the desired flight path, the flight crew should have determined that their speed was too low and attempted a &quot;go-around&quot; and re-attempt to land. However, this decision was not made until the altitude was less than , by which point the aircraft could not accomplish a go-around. The tail section of the aircraft struck the seawall at the end of the runway and became detached from the airframe; the plane ended up down the runway. Passengers and crew members evacuated before a fire, due to the ignition of engine lubricant, destroyed the aircraft. There were three fatalities, making this the first fatal Boeing 777 crash.
* On July 7, 2017, Air Canada Flight 759, an Airbus A320-200, from Toronto Pearson was instructed by air traffic control to go around after overflying Taxiway C for 0.25 miles (400 m) while on visual approach for 28R. The A320 overflew the first two aircraft lined up on Taxiway C by roughly 100 feet (30 m). The pilots landed the aircraft afterward without incident. A total of three wide-body aircraft and one narrow-body aircraft were lined up awaiting takeoff on Taxiway C. The NTSB launched an investigation into the incident, publishing the final report in September 2018.
* On October 22, 2017, Air Canada Flight 781, another Airbus A320-200, from Montreal landed on Runway 28R after being instructed by the ATC six times to go around, without any response from the pilots. Upon landing the crew reported they had radio problems in the cockpit, but a later FAA investigation found that the crew inadvertently switched from the SFO tower frequency to the SFO ground frequency after receiving their landing clearance.
* On March 7, 2024, a Boeing 777-200ER of United Airlines, registration N226UA, was climbing out of runway 28R bound for Osaka, Japan, when one of the six wheels on the left main gear truck detached and fell in a parking lot, damaging three cars. The aircraft landed safely at Los Angeles Airport with no casualties. An airfield safety employee was injured while clearing debris.

<doc id="250464" wikidata="Q5265717" url="?curid=250464" title="Deterministic system (philosophy)">
<text>A deterministic system is a conceptual model of the philosophical doctrine of determinism applied to a system for understanding everything that has and will occur in the system, based on the physical outcomes of causality. In a deterministic system, every action, or cause, produces a reaction, or effect, and every reaction, in turn, becomes the cause of subsequent reactions. The totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time.

To understand this concept, start with a fairly small system. Visualize a set of three dominoes lined up in a row with each domino less than a domino&#x27;s length away from its neighbors. Once the first domino has toppled, the third domino will topple because the second will topple upon being contacted by the first domino.

Small deterministic systems are easy to visualize, but are necessarily linked to the rest of reality by an initial cause and/or final effect. To go back to the dominoes, something outside the system has to cause the first domino to topple. The last domino falling might cause something else outside the system to happen. And the system itself must be considered in isolation: if external forces such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or the hands of nearby people were taken into consideration, the final domino toppling might not be a predetermined outcome. Complete isolation of a system is unrealistic, but useful for understanding what would normally happen to a system when the possibility of external influences is negligible. Complex physical systems are necessarily built using simpler ones, and using isolated systems as a starting model can help bridge the gap, and aid in understanding. The domino example is developed in the Petri net computational model.

This example assumes that dominoes toppling into each other behave deterministically. Even the above-mentioned external forces which might interrupt the system are causes which the system did not consider, but which could be explained by cause and effect in a larger deterministic system.

== Some deterministic systems ==

* Classical physics is the deterministic system assumed in the domino example which scientists can use to describe all events which take place on a scale larger than individual atoms. Classical physics includes Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, Classical electrodynamics, thermodynamics, the Special theory of relativity, the General theory of relativity, chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics. Some of these systems are complex, and events may be difficult to predict in practice, but if the starting conditions were known in enough detail, the outcomes of events in such systems could be predicted.
* Nearly all electronic computers in use today are based on theoretical von Neumann computers or Turing machines, i.e.: they are devices that perform one small, deterministic step at a time. If all inputs are specified, the computer will always produce a particular output which is calculated deterministically. Computer scientists also study other models of computation including parallel computers (more than one deterministic step at a time), and quantum computers (which are based on non-deterministic quantum mechanical models). Computer systems or programs are often described as non-deterministic if their behavior depends on factors that cannot be predicted or reliably reproduced, such as the time of day or the speed at which the user enters data at the keyboard. This, however, is a somewhat different usage of the term.
* Behaviorism, an approach to psychology based on the proposition that behavior can be researched scientifically without recourse to inner mental states, is usually considered to be deterministic and opposed to free will.

== Non-deterministic systems ==

Events without natural causes cannot be part of a deterministic system. Whether such events actually occur is a matter of philosophical and scientific debate – however, possible uncaused events include:
*Random Quantum events
:Quantum physics holds that certain events such as radioactive decay and movement of particles are completely random when taken at the level of single atoms or smaller. Schrödinger&#x27;s cat is a famous thought experiment in which a cat&#x27;s survival cannot be determined theoretically before the experiment is done. For almost all everyday non-microscopic occurrences, however, the probability of such random events is extremely close to zero, and can be approximated to almost certainty with statistics using the correspondence principle. The philosophical consequences of quantum physics were once considered by many (including Albert Einstein) to be a major problem for the scientific method which traditionally used a strong version of scientific determinism (see Philosophy of science).

== Systems with controversial classification ==

Some systems are particularly difficult to classify as deterministic or not, and have generated much philosophical debate. The major example would be human minds, and possibly animal minds too. Can people have free will if their minds are truly deterministic? Conversely, when deterministic computers are said to exhibit artificial intelligence, how are their minds similar to ours?

== The entire universe ==

The larger the deterministic system, the longer the necessary chain of cause and effect. The entire universe may be considered as such a system, which creates its own philosophical questions (see Determinism).

<doc id="250466" wikidata="Q1502032" url="?curid=250466" title="Generative art">
<text>Generative art is post-conceptual art that has been created (in whole or in part) with the use of an autonomous system. An &quot;autonomous system&quot; in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

&quot;Generative art&quot; often refers to algorithmic art (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork) and synthetic media (general term for any algorithmically generated media), but artists can also make generative art using systems of chemistry, biology, mechanics and robotics, smart materials, manual randomization, mathematics, data mapping, symmetry, and tiling.

== History ==

The use of the word &quot;generative&quot; in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of &quot;Artificial DNA&quot; defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of autonomous systems, required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named &quot;emergent&quot;. Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term &quot;generative art&quot; in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by Georg Nees and Frieder Nake in 1965: A. Michael Noll did his initial computer art, combining randomness with order, in 1962, and exhibited it along with works by Bell Julesz in 1965.

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled &quot;Generative Computergrafik&quot;. While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later. The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was &quot;computer-grafik&quot;. &quot;Generative art&quot; and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including Manfred Mohr and Ken Knowlton. Vera Molnár (born 1924) is a French media artist of Hungarian origin. Molnar is widely considered to be a pioneer of generative art, and is also one of the first women to use computers in her art practice. 

The term &quot;Generative Art&quot; with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the &quot;Generative Art&quot; conference in Milan in 1998. The term has also been used to describe geometric abstract art where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practiced by the Argentinian artists Eduardo Mac Entyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as &quot;Hunsy Belmood&quot; and &quot;Edward Larsocchi&quot;. In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled &#x27;Generative Art Forms&#x27; at the Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast Festival.

In 1970 the School of the Art Institute of Chicago created a department called &quot;Generative Systems&quot;. As described by Sonia Landy Sheridan the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information. Also noteworthy is John Dunn, first a student and then a collaborator of Sheridan.

In 1988 Clauser identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book &quot;Citta&#x27; Aleatorie&quot;.

In 1989 Franke referred to &quot;generative mathematics&quot; as &quot;the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images.&quot;

From the mid-1990s Brian Eno popularized the terms generative music and generative systems, making a connection with earlier experimental music by Terry Riley, Steve Reich and Philip Glass.

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy. 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.
On-line discussion has centered around the eu-gene mailing list, which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field. These activities have more recently been joined by the Generator.x conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella jointing several generative artists and scientists in the editorial board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term. As Boden and Edmonds put it in 2011:

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by Adrian Ward from 1999:

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:

Around the 2020s, generative AI models learned to imitate the distinct style of particular authors. For example, a generative image model such as Stable Diffusion is able to model the stylistic characteristics of an artist like Pablo Picasso (including his particular brush strokes, use of colour, perspective, and so on), and a user can engineer a prompt such as &quot;an astronaut riding a horse, by Picasso&quot; to cause the model to generate a novel image applying the artist&#x27;s style to an arbitrary subject. Generative image models have received significant backlash from artists who object to their style being imitated without their permission, arguing that this harms their ability to profit from their own work.

==Types==

===Music===

Johann Kirnberger&#x27;s &quot;Musikalisches Würfelspiel&quot; (&quot;Musical Dice Game&quot;) of 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.

The fugues of J.S. Bach could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer. Similarly, serialism follows strict procedures which, in some cases, can be set up to generate entire compositions with limited human intervention.

Composers such as John Cage, Farmers Manual, and Brian Eno have used generative systems in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist Ellsworth Kelly created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid. He also created works on paper that he then cut into strips or squares and reassembled using chance operations to determine placement.
Artists such as Hans Haacke have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.
François Morellet has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork. Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create Moiré Patterns. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids. Sol LeWitt created generative art in the form of systems expressed in natural language and systems of geometric permutation. Harold Cohen&#x27;s AARON system is a longstanding project combining software artificial intelligence with robotic painting devices to create physical artifacts. 
Steina and Woody Vasulka are video art pioneers who used analog video feedback to create generative art. Video feedback is now cited as an example of deterministic chaos, and the early explorations by the Vasulkas anticipated contemporary science by many years.
Software systems exploiting evolutionary computing to create visual form include those created by Scott Draves and Karl Sims.
The digital artist Joseph Nechvatal has exploited models of viral contagion. 
&quot;Autopoiesis&quot; by Ken Rinaldo includes fifteen musical and robotic sculptures that interact with the public and modify their behaviors based on both the presence of the participants and each other.
Jean-Pierre Hebert and Roman Verostko are founding members of the Algorists, a group of artists who create their own algorithms to create art.
A. Michael Noll, of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated, programmed computer art using mathematical equations and programmed randomness, starting in 1962.

The French artist Jean-Max Albert, beside environmental sculptures like &quot;Iapetus&quot;, and &quot;O=C=O&quot;, developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The &quot;Calmoduline Monument&quot; project is based on the property of a protein, calmodulin, to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene. The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its &quot;typical&quot; growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant&#x27;s &quot;decisions&quot; suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.

Maurizio Bolognini works with generative machines to address conceptual and social concerns.
Mark Napier is a pioneer in data mapping, creating works based on the streams of zeros and ones in Ethernet traffic, as part of the &quot;Carnivore&quot; project. Martin Wattenberg pushed this theme further, transforming &quot;data sets&quot; as diverse as musical scores (in &quot;Shape of Song&quot;, 2001) and Wikipedia edits (History Flow, 2003, with Fernanda Viegas) into dramatic visual compositions.
The Canadian artist San Base developed a &quot;Dynamic Painting&quot; algorithm in 2002. Using computer algorithms as &quot;brush strokes&quot;, Base creates sophisticated imagery that evolves over time to produce a fluid, never-repeating artwork.

Since 1996 there have been ambigram generators that auto generate ambigrams.

Italian composer Pietro Grossi, pioneer of computer music since 1986, he extended his experiments to images, (same procedure used in his musical work) precisely to computer graphics, writing programs with specific auto-decisions, and developing the concept of &quot;HomeArt&quot;, presented for the first time in the exhibition &quot;New Atlantis: the continent of electronic music&quot; organized by the Venice Biennale in 1986.

Some contemporary artists who create generative visual artworks are John Maeda, Daniel Shiffman, Zachary Lieberman, Golan Levin, Casey Reas, Ben Fry, and Giles Whitaker (artist).

===Software art===

For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. Adrian Ward created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design.

===Architecture===
In 1987 Celestino Soddu created the artificial DNA of Italian Medieval towns able to generate endless 3D models of cities identifiable as belonging to the idea.

In 2010, Michael Hansmeyer generated architectural columns in a project called &quot;Subdivided Columns – A New Order (2010)&quot;. The piece explored how the simple process of repeated subdivision can create elaborate architectural patterns. Rather than designing any columns directly, Hansmeyer designed a process that produced columns automatically. The process could be run again and again with different parameters to create endless permutations. Endless permutations could be considered a hallmark of generative design.

===Literature===
Writers such as Tristan Tzara, Brion Gysin, and William Burroughs used the cut-up technique to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. Jackson Mac Low produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; Philip M. Parker has written software to automatically generate entire books. Jason Nelson used generative methods with speech-to-text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.

In the late 2010s, authors began to experiment with neural networks trained on large language datasets. David Jhave Johnston&#x27;s &quot;ReRites&quot; is an early example of human-edited AI-generated poetry.

===Live coding===

Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as Csound, SuperCollider, Fluxus and TidalCycles, including patching environments such as Max/MSP, Pure Data and vvvv. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as live coding. As with many examples of software art, because live coding emphasizes human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.

=== Blockchain ===
In 2020, Erick &quot;Snowfro&quot; Calderon launched the Art Blocks platform for combining the ideas of generative art and the blockchain, with resulting artworks created as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the key innovations with the generative art created in this way is that all the source code and algorithm for creating the art has to be finalized and put on the blockchain permanently, without any ability to alter it further. Only when the artwork is sold (&quot;minted&quot;), the artwork is generated; the result is random yet should reflect the overall aesthetic defined by the artist. Calderon argues that this process forces the artist to be very thoughtful of the algorithm behind the art:Until today, a [generative] artist would create an algorithm, press the spacebar 100 times, pick five of the best ones and print them in high quality. Then they would frame them, and put them in a gallery. &quot;Maybe.&quot; Because Art Blocks forces the artist to accept every single output of the algorithm as their signed piece, the artist has to go back and tweak the algorithm until it&#x27;s perfect. They can&#x27;t just cherry pick the good outputs. That elevates the level of algorithmic execution because the artist is creating something that they know they&#x27;re proud of before they even know what&#x27;s going to come out on the other side.
==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In 2003, Philip Galanter published the most widely cited theory of generative art which describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of Murray Gell-Mann and Seth Lloyd&#x27;s effective complexity is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes entropy and allows maximal data compression, and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier information theory influenced views of Max Bense and Abraham Moles where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they do not assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art (computer art), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).
=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterized by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:

# Can a machine originate anything? &quot;Related to machine intelligence - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?&quot;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art? &quot;If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer&#x27;s perspective?&quot;
# Can human aesthetics be formalized?
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable? &quot;Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?&quot;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? &quot;For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?&quot;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? &quot;How could generative art give rise to artifacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?&quot;
# What characterizes good generative art? &quot;How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?&quot;
# What can we learn about art from generative art? &quot;For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market?&quot;
# What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?

Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?

<text>William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings (c. 1431 – June 1483) was an English nobleman. A loyal follower of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses, he became a close friend and one of the most important courtiers of King Edward IV, whom he served as Lord Chamberlain. At the time of Edward&#x27;s death he was one of the most powerful and richest men in England. He was executed following accusations of treason by Edward&#x27;s brother and ultimate successor, Richard III. The date of his death is disputed; early histories give 13 June, which is the traditional date.

==Biography==
William Hastings, born about 1430–1431, was the eldest son of Sir Leonard Hastings, and his wife Alice Camoys, daughter of Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys.
Hastings succeeded his father in service to the House of York and through this service became close to his distant cousin the future Edward IV, whom he was to serve loyally all his life. He was High Sheriff of Warwickshire and High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1455.

He fought alongside Edward at the Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross in Herefordshire in the Wars of the Roses, and was present at the proclamation of Edward as king in London on 4 March 1461, and then when the new king secured his crown at the Battle of Towton shortly thereafter. He was knighted on the field of battle. With the establishment of the Yorkist regime, Hastings became one of the key figures in the realm, most importantly as Master of the Mint and Lord Chamberlain, an office he held for the duration of the reign, and which made him one of the most important means of access to the king. He was also created Baron Hastings, a title reinforced by grants of land and office, primarily in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. In 1462, he was invested as a Knight of the Garter. Hastings&#x27; tenure as Master of the Mint occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump in England.

In 1474, he was awarded royal licence to crenellate at three of his landholdings in Leicestershire; at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Kirby Muxloe, and at Bagworth. He built extensively at Ashby, mostly making additions to the pre-existing manor house built by the de la Zouch family in the thirteenth century. His greatest achievement at Ashby was the Hastings Tower. At Kirby Muxloe Castle he began an intricate fortified house of red brick, one of the first of its kind in the county. Thanks to English Heritage, the castles at Ashby and Kirby can still be seen, but nothing survives to indicate any construction at Bagworth.

His importance in these years is recorded in a number of sources, and was recognised by the greatest peer in the realm, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. In 1462, Warwick arranged for Hastings to marry his widowed sister, Katherine Neville. (Katherine&#x27;s first husband, Lord Bonville, had been killed at St Albans in 1461, and their infant daughter, Cecily, succeeded to the Bonville titles and estates.)

Despite this matrimonial relationship with the Nevilles, when Warwick drove Edward IV into exile in 1470, Hastings went with Edward, and accompanied the king back the following spring. Hastings raised troops for Edward in the English Midlands and served as one of the leading captains of the Yorkist forces at both Barnet and Tewkesbury.

His service, loyalty and ability, along with the fall of his Neville in-laws, made Hastings even more important during the second half of Edward IV&#x27;s reign. He continued to serve as Chamberlain, and was awarded the position of Chamberlain of the Exchequer in 1471, which he held until 1483. He was also appointed Lieutenant of Calais, which made him an important player in foreign affairs, and given authority over an increasingly large section of the English Midlands. At court, he was involved in two lengthy feuds with members of Queen Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s family, most notably with her son Thomas Grey, first Marquess of Dorset. A mistress of both Grey and Hastings was Jane Shore; Grey&#x27;s wife was the wealthy heiress Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington, who also happened to be Hastings&#x27; stepdaughter. Shore was instrumental in bringing about the alliance between Hastings and the Woodvilles, which was formed while Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was Protector, before he took the throne as King Richard III. She was accused of carrying messages between Hastings and Edward IV&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth Woodville. It was because of her role in this alliance that Shore was charged with conspiracy, along with Hastings and the Woodvilles, against the Protector&#x27;s government.

==Death==

After the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, the Dowager Queen appointed family members to key positions and rushed to expedite the coronation of her young son Edward V as king, circumventing Richard, Duke of Gloucester, whom the late king had appointed Lord Protector. Hastings, who had long been friendly with Richard and hostile to the Woodvilles, was a key figure in checking the Dowager Queen&#x27;s manoeuvres. While keeping the Woodvilles in check in London, Hastings kept Richard closely informed of their proceedings and asked him to hasten to London. Richard met up with the young king and his party as pre-arranged, who was on his way to London, with his Woodville relatives. Hastings then supported Richard&#x27;s formal installation as Lord Protector and collaborated closely with him in the royal council.

Affairs changed dramatically on 13 June 1483 during a council meeting at the Tower of London: according to contemporaries, Richard, supported by the Duke of Buckingham, accused Hastings and two other council members of having committed high treason by conspiring against his life with the Woodvilles. The contemporary (1483) account of Dominic Mancini records Richard&#x27;s claim that those who were arrested &quot;had come with concealed weapons so that they could be the first to unleash a violent attack&quot;; this was later confirmed in a public proclamation. While the other alleged conspirators were imprisoned, Hastings was beheaded. The timing of his execution is disputed, although Charles Ross, in his biography of Richard III, argued for the traditional date of 13 June.

The summary execution of the popular Hastings was controversial among contemporaries and has been interpreted differently by historians and other authors. The traditional account, harking back to authors of the Tudor period, including William Shakespeare, considered the conspiracy charge invented and merely a convenient excuse to remove Lord Hastings, who was known for his loyalty to the dead King Edward IV and his heirs, as while he remained alive he would have been too formidable an obstacle to Richard&#x27;s own plans to seize the throne. Others have been more open to the possibility that such a conspiracy did in fact exist and that Richard may have reacted to secure his own position. Clements R. Markham argues that Hastings was executed one week after his arrest on 20 June 1483, and after a trial. Several witnesses were present, hence a treason trial could have been conducted at an ad hoc Court of Chivalry convened by Richard as High Constable of England.

Despite the accusation of treason, no attainder was issued against Lord Hastings which again suggests a trial by the Court of Chivalry which had no power to attaint. Hence, his wife and sons were allowed to inherit his lands and properties. Hastings was buried in the north aisle of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, next to his friend King Edward IV.

==In literature==
He is portrayed in two of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays: &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

In Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film version of &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955), Lord Hastings is played by actor Alec Clunes.

In Al Pacino&#x27;s documentary &quot;Looking for Richard&quot;, Lord Hastings is played by actor Kevin Conway.

==Family==
Hastings married, before 6 February 1462, Katherine Neville, sister of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known as &quot;Warwick the Kingmaker,&quot; and widow of William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington, slain at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, by whom he had had four sons and two daughters:

*Edward Hastings, 2nd Baron Hastings, who married Mary Hungerford.
*Sir William Hastings.
*Sir Richard Hastings, who married, and had two daughters and coheirs, Elizabeth Hastings, who married John Beaumont of Gracedieu, Leicestershire, Master of the Rolls, and Mary Hastings, who married Thomas Saunders of Harringworth, Northamptonshire.
*George Hastings.
*Anne Hastings, who married her father&#x27;s ward, George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury.
*Elizabeth Hastings.

<text>Oakland International Airport is an international airport in Oakland, California, United States. The airport is located south of downtown Oakland and east of San Francisco, serving the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. The airport is owned by the Port of Oakland and has domestic passenger flights to cities throughout the United States and international flights to Mexico, and El Salvador, in addition to cargo flights to China and Japan. The airport covers of land. The airport is an operating base for Southwest Airlines, which operates point-to-point routes with bases instead of a traditional network with hubs.

==History==
===Early years===
The city of Oakland looked into the construction of an airport starting in 1925. The announcement of the Dole Air Race for a flight from California to Hawaii provided the incentive to purchase in April 1927 for the airport. The runway was the longest in the world at the time and was built in just 21 days ahead of the Dole race start. The airport was dedicated by Charles Lindbergh on September 17. In its early days, because of its long runway enabling safe takeoff rolls for fuel-heavy aircraft, Oakland was the departing point of several historic flights, including Charles Kingsford Smith&#x27;s historic US-Australia flight in 1928 and Amelia Earhart&#x27;s final flight in 1937. Earhart departed from this airport when she made her final, ill-fated voyage, intending to return there after circumnavigating the globe.

Boeing Air Transport (a predecessor of United Airlines) began scheduled flights to Oakland in December 1927. It was joined by Trans World Airlines (TWA) in 1932. In 1929 Boeing opened the Boeing School of Aeronautics on the field, which expanded rapidly in 1939 as part of the Civilian Pilot Training Program. Thousands of pilots and mechanics were trained before the facility was changed into the United Air Lines training center in 1945.

In 1943 the U.S. Armed Forces temporarily took over Oakland Airport and opened Naval Air Station Oakland. It was transformed into an airlift base for military flights to the Pacific islands, ordering all scheduled services to move to San Francisco International Airport. After the war, airlines slowly returned to Oakland; Western Airlines began flights in 1946, and was followed by American Airlines, TWA, United, Transocean Air Lines and Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA). Oakland became a larger center for non-scheduled and supplemental air carriers: some of the largest such companies were based and headquartered in Oakland including Transocean Air Lines, World Airways, Trans International Airlines, Universal Airlines and Saturn Airways. Other large supplemental carriers, such as United States Overseas Airlines, had operational bases in Oakland. Oakland became one of the largest overhaul and maintenance operations in the country when Aircraft Engine and Maintenance Company (AEMCO) processed thousands of aircraft. 
The airport&#x27;s first Jet Age terminal (now Terminal 1) was designed by John Carl Warnecke &amp; Associates and opened in 1962, part of a $20 million expansion on bay fill that included the 10,000-foot (3048 m) runway 11/29 (now 12/30). The May 1963 OAG showed 15 airline flights arriving in Oakland each day, including nine from San Francisco; in June 1963, TWA flew Oakland&#x27;s first scheduled jet, a Convair 880, to Chicago. American Airlines scheduled service from Oakland to Phoenix and then into Dallas using the Boeing 720 aircraft. Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) provided several flights within California from OAK using Boeing 727 and DC-9 aircraft. United Airlines introduced non-stop service to Chicago and on the San Francisco-Oakland-Los Angeles route using the Boeing 727.

During the Vietnam War, World Airways shuttled thousands of military passengers through Oakland to their bases in Southeast Asia, and an international arrivals facility was built, allowing the airport to handle international flights for the first time. World Airways had broken ground on the World Air Center at Oakland International Airport. The maintenance hangar could store four Boeing 747s. It opened in May 1973. During its operation, World Airways provided contract maintenance services for 14 airlines in the facility. By 1988, World Airways vacated the Oakland maintenance base and moved its headquarters to Washington Dulles. That same year, United Airlines assumed the lease on the maintenance base.

After the war, Oakland&#x27;s traffic slumped, but airline deregulation prompted several low-fare carriers to begin flights. This increase prompted the airport to build a $16.3 million second terminal, the Lionel J. Wilson Terminal 2, with seven gates for PSA and AirCal service. In the mid-1980s, People Express Airlines provided scheduled Boeing 747 transcontinental flights from OAK to Newark. SFO Helicopter Airlines served scheduled passenger flights between SFO and the Oakland Convention Center from OAK for many years until 1985. In 1987, British Airways and Air France Concorde visited Oakland to provide supersonic two-hour flights to the Pacific halfway to Hawaii and back to Oakland. Additionally, Concorde returned for a special around-the-world trip covering 38,215 miles over a three-week tour in March 1989.

FedEx Express opened an air cargo base at OAK in 1988, which is now one of the busiest air freight terminals in the United States. In the 1990s, Southwest Airlines opened a crew base in Oakland, and expanded its flights to become the airport&#x27;s dominant passenger carrier. The airport has international arrival facilities, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection office. The 1990s saw a rise of low-cost carriers serving Oakland, Morris Air (later merged into Southwest Airlines), and MarkAir to name a few, provided several domestic destinations from OAK. During the 1990s, tour operator SunTrips contracted Aerocancun and Leisure Air to provide scheduled charter flights from OAK to sun destinations during the early 1990s. TAESA and Mexicana Airlines also flew between Oakland and cities in Mexico for many years. In the past Tower Air and Corsairfly flew Orly Airport to OAK to Papeete, Tahiti; Martinair flew to Schiphol Airport; and CityBird flew to Brussels Airport.

===2000s===

United Airlines vacated its Oakland Maintenance Center in May 2003 and transferred work to its base across the bay at San Francisco International Airport (SFO).

Oakland International Airport began a $300 million expansion and renovation project in 2004, including adding five gates in Terminal 2. The new concourse partially opened in the fall of 2006, was fully opened by the spring of 2007, and a new baggage claim in Terminal 2 opened in the summer of 2006. The former Terminal 2 baggage claim has been replaced by a renovated and expanded security screening area. As part of this program, airport roadways, curbsides and parking lots were also renovated by the end of 2008.

In 2008, Oakland saw a series of cutbacks due to high fuel costs and airline bankruptcies, more than other Bay Area airports. In just a few days, Oakland&#x27;s numerous non-stops to Hawaii were eliminated following the liquidation of ATA Airlines and Aloha Airlines, although Hawaiian Airlines started a daily flight to Honolulu a month later. Skybus Airlines stopped flying to Columbus, OH when it ended operations on April 5. American Airlines and Continental Airlines both dropped Oakland on September 3, United Airlines ended service to Los Angeles on November 2.

===2010s===

Following the years of the Great Recession, during which a few airlines were either liquidated (ATA Airlines and Aloha Airlines), or consolidated business to San Francisco International Airport, OAK started a gradual recovery, which has continued through 2017.

In 2009, Allegiant Air moved operations from San Francisco International Airport, before designating OAK as a focus city. After the bankruptcies of ATA and Aloha Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines replaced their nonstop services to Hawaii. In the same year, Volaris began service to OAK as their first destination in the San Francisco Bay Area and held a commercial agreement with Southwest Airlines, until its merger with AirTran Airways in 2011. Malaysia-based AirAsia X honored its new partners, the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). AirAsia X had one of their planes full of its executives and crew members &quot;touch down&quot; at OAK in acknowledgement of the to-be-announced sponsorship. AirAsia executives had new optimism that service between the U.S. and the airline&#x27;s main base in Kuala Lumpur, could possibly happen earlier than originally expected, but has yet to come to fruition as of 2020.

In 2009, OAK had the highest on-time arrival percentage among the 40 busiest North American airports.

In 2011, Spirit Airlines returned to OAK after several years of absence, eventually flying a combined total of seven year-round and seasonal routes by the summer of 2017. Oakland International Airport also celebrated its 85th anniversary in 2011, commemorating the first transpacific crossing by air from OAK to Hawaii, which took place on June 29, 1927, in &quot;The Bird of Paradise&quot;, flown by Hegenberger and Maitland. In 2012 United Airlines pulled out of OAK, consolidating operations at San Francisco International Airport, its Bay Area hub. Arkefly (which later re-branded as TUI Airlines Netherlands) chose OAK as a San Francisco Bay Area gateway, flying twice weekly to Amsterdam, via a stop at Los Angeles International Airport. Arkefly provided 18 weeks of scheduled service in the summer of 2012. The airline followed with a similar schedule during the summer of 2013, before discontinuing service at OAK.

In 2013, FedEx Express opened a $30 million upgrade of its hub facility at OAK, including additions to accommodate the airline&#x27;s new Boeing 777 Freighter fleet. In 2014, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced its first two year-round flights to Stockholm and Oslo airport, using Boeing 787-8 aircraft seating 291 passengers operated by Norwegian Long Haul. The flights were the first-ever nonstop services offered from the two Scandinavian capitals to the San Francisco Bay Area, providing several connections throughout Europe. The Oslo flight was later changed to a seasonal schedule.

A long-proposed extension of the BART system to the airport opened on November 22, 2014, connecting the BART Coliseum station with a station in the parking lot opposite of the airport terminals. The new system consists of a mostly elevated structure, running the length of Hegenberger Road.

In May 2015, Oakland International Airport&#x27;s Moving Modern program construction commenced a $100 million renovation of the Terminal 1 complex. The project included seismic architectural retrofits in central buildings, replacement and upgrading of infrastructure and improvement of the passenger environment. The project was completed in Spring 2017.

In 2016, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced that nonstop flights would connect Oakland with London beginning the following spring. British Airways responded with their own service to London, with both airlines providing service to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport. American Airlines also returned and re-branded, following a merger with US Airways; the latter previously had a short-term presence at OAK, following a separate merger with America West Airlines during the previous decade. Southwest Airlines inaugurated nonstop flights from Oakland to Mexico for the airline&#x27;s first international nonstop flights from OAK. The additional routes also gave the airline a combined total of 30 year-round and seasonal flights at the airport as of early 2017.

In 2017, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced nonstop flights connecting Oakland with Copenhagen on a seasonal basis from March 28, and Oakland with Barcelona from June 7 to operate year-round. Level, a new carrier owned by IAG, responded with their own Barcelona service, started flights initially operated by IAG partner Iberia on June 2, with both airlines providing service to Barcelona El Prat Airport. In the months following, Norwegian announced in May the introduction of nonstop flights between Oakland and Rome Fiumicino started on February 6, 2018, and in July the introduction of nonstop flights between Oakland and Paris Charles de Gaulle began on April 10, 2018.

=== Recent years ===
Between mid-2018 and early 2020, OAK had both lost and was losing domestic and international nonstop routes; the indefinite grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX by both Southwest and American, the &quot;restructuring&quot; of schedules by airlines, and a lack of demand all contribute to this. British Airways ended service in October 2018. Level moved its operations to SFO, as did Norwegian Air Shuttle for its seven routes serving OAK. Southwest Airlines ended systemwide service with Newark Liberty International Airport in November 2019, followed by discontinuing three more routes with OAK effective January 2020. Three other routes are currently suspended by Southwest until further notice, while American did the same during summer 2019 for service with Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, JetBlue withdrew operations from OAK in April 2020 while American Airlines withdrew in early June 2020. However, some traffic is returning. In December 2022 Volaris El Salvador announced nonstop flights connecting Oakland with San Salvador beginning the following spring of 2023. In late summer of 2023, Avianca El Salvador announced seasonal nonstop service from Oakland to San Salvador. In September 2023, Viva Aerobus announced nonstop service between Oakland and Monterrey.

In 2024, the airport announced that it was changing its official name from Metropolitan Oakland International Airport to San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport. The Port of Oakland Board of Commissioners approved the new name on April 11. Among the reasons given for the change were that many travelers do not understand that the City of Oakland is part of the Bay Area and that its airport directly faces San Francisco Bay. Another reason was to reduce the long-running confusion between OAK and Auckland Airport in Auckland, New Zealand. The confusion has been especially severe for Chinese-speaking travelers, because the two cities&#x27; names are written identically in simplified Chinese (&quot;奥克兰&quot;) and must be distinguished by context. On May 9, the Oakland Board of Port Commissioners unanimously voted and granted final approval for the name change. The city attorney of San Francisco, which owns SFO, has filed a federal trademark lawsuit against Oakland for the decision. The Port of Oakland has filed a countersuit, pointing out even SFO is not technically located in San Francisco, but rather San Mateo County. 

On November 12, 2024, U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas S. Hixson granted SFO&#x27;s motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered OAK to stop using the words &quot;San Francisco Bay&quot; in its name while the case remained pending (that is, through trial on the merits of the parties&#x27; claims).

=== Proposed developments ===
OAK handled 13.38 million passengers in 2019 but is projecting passenger numbers to reach 20 million by 2028, and 25 million by 2035. To handle this expected growth, the Port of Oakland is eyeing a major expansion to consolidate and modernize existing terminals while creating a third passenger terminal. This project is in the early stages of planning, with a draft environmental report published in the summer of 2023. The third passenger terminal would be built with up to 25 new gates. Terminals 1 and 2 would be condensed into a single terminal, with fewer gates, shared ticketing, baggage handling, and security. Additionally, customs facilities will be expanded to accommodate additional international flights. A connector will connect the consolidated terminal with the new terminal. A net gain of 16 gates could be added. Also as part of the project, OAK plans to reconfigure cargo facilities and improve roadways, parking, and other support facilities.

==Facilities==

===Terminals===
Oakland International Airport has two terminals with a total of 29 gates. The terminals are connected at post-security and gate areas, enabling arriving passengers to go straight to their connecting flights without having to re-enter the security check. All non-pre-cleared international flights are processed in Terminal 1.

*Terminal 1 has 16 gates serving Advanced Air, Alaska, Allegiant, Delta, Hawaiian, Southwest, Spirit, Sun Country, Viva, Volaris, and Volaris El Salvador.
*Terminal 2 has 13 gates serving Southwest.
JSX is housed in a facility separate from the main passenger terminals.

===Runways===
Oakland International Airport has four runways. Changes to Earth&#x27;s magnetic field required runways 27 and 29 to be renamed 28 and 30 in 2013.
* South Field (commercial and cargo operations):
** Runway 12/30: asphalt
* North Field (general aviation operations):
** Runway 10R/28L: asphalt
** Runway 10L/28R: asphalt
** Runway 15/33: asphalt
A taxiway that connects the north and south runways passes over Ron Cowan Parkway, forming an aircraft bridge.

More than 95% of the time, winds in the area blow from the west or north, and aircraft arrive at Oakland from the southeast and depart to the northwest. On occasions when winds blow from the east or south, aircraft operate in the other direction, arriving from the northwest and departing to the southeast.

===General aviation===
Signature Flight Support is the primary fixed-base operator (FBO) at Oakland International Airport. Before BBA Aviation acquired Landmark Aviation, the FBO at OAK was the first in the Bay Area and the twelfth location added to Landmark&#x27;s network in 2011. The FBO is centrally located at OAK&#x27;s North Field in the Hangar 5 facility. Landmark has initiated a multimillion-dollar renovation project, having already upgraded the FBO terminal along with beginning hangar and property improvements. KaiserAir also provides FBO services at Oakland&#x27;s North Field, performing maintenance on Gulfstream, Hawker, Cessna and other business jet aircraft. KaiserAir operates Kona Shuttle with flights to Hawaii and charter business jets.

== Access ==

=== Car ===
The airport is accessible by private automobile from Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) which is away via Hegenberger Road or 98th Avenue heading west. Both roads converge into Airport Road before looping in front of the terminal entrances. Doolittle Drive (State Route 61) crosses both Hegenberger Road and 98th Avenue just to the east of where they converge into Airport Road, providing access to the nearby city of Alameda.

=== Public transportation ===

==== Train ====
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) serves the airport at Oakland International Airport station via the Oakland Airport Connector, which is an automated guideway transit (AGT) line connecting the airport to nearby Coliseum station, served by mainline BART trains and Amtrak. The AGT vehicles depart the station every five minutes during daily peak hours and are designed to transport travelers to and from the airport in about eight minutes with an on-time performance of more than 99 percent. A fare surcharge is added for trips to or from Oakland International Airport. The Oakland Airport Connector Project is largely attributable to the work of former BART director and port commissioner Carole Ward Allen who was responsible for securing local, state, and federal funding for the project. Ward Allen advocated for its approval before several transportation authorities endorsed the project, which created between 2,500 and 5,200 direct and indirect jobs. Some critics of the project argued that the money would be better spent on supporting existing local transit agencies, which had financial issues at the time.

==== Bus ====
Three AC Transit routes directly serve the airport; Line 21 runs during the daytime and early evenings, Line 73 runs at all times, and Line 805 runs overnight as a part of the Bay Area&#x27;s All Nighter bus network: 
* Line 21 provides daytime and early evening service from the airport to the Dimond District via Bay Farm Island, Alameda, and Fruitvale, making a limited connection with the Alameda Harbor Bay Ferry at Bay Farm Island, and a full-time connection with BART at Fruitvale station.
* Line 73 provides 24/7 service from the airport to the Eastmont Transit Center via Hegenberger Road and 73rd Avenue, connecting with Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; service and BART at Oakland Coliseum station. This route provides a cheaper alternative to BART&#x27;s Oakland Airport Connector.
* Line 805 is an All Nighter service from the airport to the Uptown Transit Center in Downtown Oakland. Route 805 supplements Route 73 service to the Eastmont Transit Center before traveling north on MacArthur Boulevard and Grand Avenue to the Uptown Transit Center, making a limited connection with Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; service at Oakland Coliseum station, and additional limited connections with BART at Oakland Coliseum station and 19th Street Oakland station.

Sonoma County Airport Express additionally provides airport bus service between the airport and Marin County, Sonoma County, and the Charles M. Schulz–Sonoma County Airport.

<text>Hollywood Burbank Airport is a public airport northwest of downtown Burbank, in Los Angeles County, California, United States. The airport serves Burbank, Hollywood, and the northern Greater Los Angeles area, which includes Glendale, Pasadena, the San Fernando Valley and the Santa Clarita Valley. It is closer to many popular attractions, including Griffith Park, Universal Studios Hollywood, and Downtown Los Angeles, than Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and it is the only airport in the area with a direct rail connection to Downtown Los Angeles, with service from two stations: Burbank Airport–North and Burbank Airport–South. Nonstop flights mostly serve cities in the western United States, though Delta Air Lines has regular routes to Atlanta.

Originally, the entire airport was within the Burbank city limits, but the north end of Runway 15/33 has been extended into the city of Los Angeles. The airport is owned by the Burbank–Glendale–Pasadena Airport Authority and controlled by the governments of those cities. The Airport Authority contracts with TBI Airport Management, Inc., to operate the airport, which has its own police and fire departments, the Burbank–Glendale–Pasadena Airport Authority Police. They also share police helicopters registered N102CG and N103CG both based out of Burbank airport on the north-east end of the airport on taxiway Bravo. Boarding uses air stairs instead of jet bridges. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility.

==History==
The airport has been named United Airport (1930–1934), Union Air Terminal (1934–1940), Lockheed Air Terminal (1940–1967), Hollywood–Burbank Airport (1967–1978), Burbank–Glendale–Pasadena Airport (1978–2003), and Bob Hope Airport after comedian Bob Hope (since 2003 as the legal name). In 2017, it was rebranded as Hollywood Burbank Airport due to the lack of recognition of Bob Hope Airport&#x27;s geographic region.

United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UA&amp;T) was a holding company created in 1928 that included Boeing Aircraft and United Air Lines, itself a holding company for a collection of small airlines that continued to operate under their own names. One of these airlines was Pacific Air Transport (PAT), which Boeing had acquired because of PAT&#x27;s west coast mail contract in January 1928. UA&amp;T sought a site for a new airport for PAT and found one in Burbank. UA&amp;T had the benefit of surveys that the Aeronautics Department of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce had conducted starting in 1926 to identify potential airport sites.

It took UA&amp;T a year and the cooperation of the city to assemble the site. The site was rife with vines and trees and the ground had to be filled and leveled, but it had good drainage, a firm landing surface, steady winds, and good access to ground transport. Construction was completed in just seven months. In an age when few aircraft had brakes and many had a tail skid instead of a wheel, runways were not usually paved; those at Burbank had a mixture of oil and sand. There were no taxi strips, but the designers left room for them. Two of the runways were over long; a third was ; all were wide. These were generous dimensions, and the site had room for expansion.


United Airport was dedicated amid much festivity (including an air show) on Memorial Day weekend (May 30 – June 1), 1930. The airport and its handsome Spanish Revival-style terminal was a showy competitor to nearby Grand Central Airport in Glendale, which was then Los Angeles&#x27; main airline terminal. The new Burbank facility was actually the largest commercial airport in the Los Angeles area until it was eclipsed in 1946 by the Los Angeles Airport in Westchester when that facility (formerly Mines Field, then Los Angeles Municipal Airport) commenced scheduled airline operations.

The Burbank facility remained United Airport until 1934 when it was renamed Union Air Terminal. The name change came the same year that Federal anti-trust actions caused United Aircraft and Transport to dissolve, which took effect September 26, 1934. The Union Air Terminal moniker stuck until Lockheed bought the airport in 1940 and renamed it Lockheed Air Terminal.

In March 1939 airlines scheduled sixteen departures a day out of Burbank: eight United Airlines, five Western Airlines and three TWA (American Airlines&#x27; three departures were still at Glendale). Airline flights continued even while Lockheed&#x27;s extensive factories supplied the war effort and developed military and civil aircraft into the mid-1960s. The April 1957 OAG lists nine weekday departures on Western, six on United, six on Pacific Air Lines, one on TWA and one on American Airlines (a nonstop to Chicago Midway Airport). Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) had 48 Douglas DC-4 departures a week to SFO and SAN (PSA did not fly out of LAX until 1958). In 1958 Transocean Air Lines Lockheed Constellations flew to Honolulu three times a week; twice a week a Constellation flew Oakland - Burbank - Chicago Midway Airport - New York Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport) - Hartford. In summer 1962 PSA flights to San Francisco and San Diego were all Lockheed L-188 Electras, a total of 32 departures a week from Burbank.

Jets arrived at Burbank in the late 1960s: Pacific Air Lines flew Boeing 727-100s nonstop to Las Vegas and San Francisco and one-stop to Eureka/Arcata. Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) flew 727s to the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego, and Hughes Airwest (previously Air West) flew Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop to Las Vegas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Denver with one-stop DC-9s to Houston Hobby Airport. Hughes Airwest even operated one-stop DC-9s to Grand Canyon National Park Airport near the south rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1986 United Airlines Boeing 767-200s flew nonstop to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport; the 767 was the largest passenger airliner ever to serve Burbank. AirCal McDonnell Douglas MD-80s flew nonstop to the Bay Area and direct to Lake Tahoe.

In 1967 Lockheed renamed the facility Hollywood–Burbank Airport. In 1970 Continental Airlines began Boeing 727-200 flights to Portland and Seattle via San Jose and also flew the short hop to Ontario. Continental later offered flights to Chicago via Ontario. Continental went on to serve Denver with nonstop Boeing 727-200s from BUR. Alaska Airlines began serving Burbank in 1981 with Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s flying nonstop and direct to Seattle and Portland, which was Alaska Air&#x27;s first service to southern California. Aloha Airlines pioneered nonstop jet service from BUR to Hawaii, flying Boeing 737-700s to Honolulu before ending all passenger operations.

A 1973 decision by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc.&quot; overturned an airport curfew imposed by the city of Burbank on flights between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am under the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Supremacy Clause on the grounds that airports were subject to federal oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration and under the terms of the Noise Control Act of 1972. The airport now has a strict voluntary noise abatement procedure to reduce noise of aircraft arriving and departing from the airport. Commercial flights are scheduled between the hours of 7:00 am and 10:00 pm. Departing flights usually take off to the south on runway 15, and arriving flights usually land on runway 8, winds permitting.

The facility remained Hollywood–Burbank Airport for more than a decade until 1978 when Lockheed sold it to the Burbank–Glendale–Pasadena Airport Authority. The airport then got its fifth name: Burbank–Glendale–Pasadena Airport (1978–2003). On November 6, 2003, the airport authority voted to change the name to Bob Hope Airport in honor of comedian Bob Hope, a longtime resident of nearby Toluca Lake, who had died earlier that year and who had kept his personal airplane at the airfield. The new name was unveiled on December 17, 2003, on the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers&#x27; first flight in 1903, the year that Bob Hope was born.

After much debate between the Airport Authority, the city of Burbank, the Transportation Security Administration, and Burbank residents, in November 2007 it was decided that construction of a new $8 million to $10 million baggage screening facility for Terminal B is legal, considering the anti-growth limitations placed on the airport. The facility will house a $2.5-million explosive detection system, used for the automatic detection of explosives within checked luggage.

On June 27, 2014, a $112 million Regional Transportation Center opened. The 520,000-square-foot (48,310-square-meter) center at Hollywood Way and Empire Avenue was also built to withstand a major earthquake while serving as an emergency &quot;nerve center.&quot; The industrial-looking hub with a red steel roof will be adorned by 16, three-story art panels. Solar panels generating 1.5 megawatts of electricity will also be added to its roof. A nearby parking garage was built to handle more than 1,000 cars, while traffic lights have been reworked around the airport.

=== Flight path changes and related noise issues ===
Flight paths of aircraft departing Hollywood Burbank Airport changed as part of the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s airspace modernization program called NextGen. An independent analysis confirmed in October 2018 that &quot;a connection was found between the [NextGen] implementation and the increase in the number of flights over areas south of the 101 Freeway.&quot;. Patrick Lammerding, the airport&#x27;s deputy executive director of planning and development, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that in 2016, the airport received 577 complaints; a year after the flight path changes, in 2018, the number rose to 222,798; in the first half of 2019, complaints soared to 616,022. Both the airport itself and third-party sources track noise complaints for the Hollywood Burbank Airport. In addition to the airport&#x27;s systems (Webtrak), as of December 14, 2022, third party site Airnoise.io has received 3,540,332 noise complaints for the Hollywood Burbank Airport. While the airport&#x27;s Webtrak website requires users to fill out a web page with all the details of each aircraft disturbance, when pressed while an aircraft is overhead, the Airnoise button and website will automatically file a complaint on the user&#x27;s behalf. While in-person meetings regarding noise issues have been held in large meeting spaces with hundreds of attendees, airport staff claims that approximately 90% of complaints are filed by 45 individuals. Such a claim is consistent with the airport&#x27;s continued inaction to address these issues, despite repeated pleas for relief and solutions from local communities and elected officials from every level of government. In 2019 and 2020, the airport and various stakeholders participated in a Southern San Fernando Valley Airport Noise Task Force administered by aviation industry consultants that held meetings and presented 16 recommendations to the FAA on June 8, 2020, to address the issue. The FAA responded by letter on September 1, 2020, that most of the recommendations were either &quot;not operationally feasible&quot; or &quot;not technically feasible&quot; and, as of July 29, 2022, has not implemented any solutions. On August 1, 2022, Hollywood Burbank Airport received $3 million for Infrastructure upgrades and $805,900 will go toward an Airport Noise Compatibility Planning study, including updating Noise Exposure Maps and identifying where the airport can undertake mitigation efforts, according to Schiff&#x27;s office. As part of the noise study, the airport is also establishing a 12-member Citizen&#x27;s Advisory Committee, which will include a majority of representatives from non-impacted areas: 3 members respectively from the airport owner cities of Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena (9 total), and 1 member, respectively, from each of Los Angeles Council Districts 2, 4, and 6 (3 total). After having taken almost 4 years to form the Citizens Advisory Committee,(See page 36) commissioners voted on March 18, 2024 to remove Los Angeles representatives from the citizen-run board.&quot;

===Replacement Terminal===

Hollywood Burbank Airport is in the process of constructing a new terminal on the northeast corner of the airport. The new terminal was required to keep the same number of gates (14) but will be significantly larger at allowing for more restrooms, additional restaurant and concession space, improved security screening areas, and other enhanced passenger amenities.

The plan to develop a new airport terminal building was unveiled by the airport authority in 2013. The replacement terminal will meet newer seismic standards and be farther from the runway as required by the Federal Aviation Administration. The location is west of Hollywood Way on undeveloped property that has been used in recent years for parking. The Burbank City Council allowed voters to decide on the plan. Known as Measure B, the proposal went before Burbank city voters on November 8, 2016, and passed with 69% of voters approving.

The next step in the terminal replacement process was for the Airport Authority to finalize the new terminal&#x27;s design, get FAA approval (NEPA clearance for which was obtained on Tuesday, May 18, 2021) and then secure the required financing from the FAA and other sources. Airport funding sources include FAA grants, parking fees, landing fees charged to airlines, as well as rents from restaurants and other concession businesses operating at the airport. There are also fees charged on airline tickets sold, including passenger facility charges and federal taxes. The airport selected the architectural firm Corgan to design the new terminal.

In July 2021, the City of Los Angeles filed a lawsuit against the FAA alleging deficiencies in the environmental review process for the proposed replacement passenger terminal at the Hollywood Burbank Airport.

On January 25, 2024, officials held a groundbreaking ceremony for the replacement terminal, with a projected opening in October 2026. The project is estimated to cost $1.2 billion.

===Proposed California High Speed Rail Connection===

The California High-Speed Rail Authority plans to have tracks running through and beneath the airport&#x27;s property, with a new underground station to be built adjacent to the proposed replacement passenger terminal. In 2022, the airport used the California Environmental Quality Act to file a lawsuit to block approval for California High-Speed Rail construction. The lawsuit was dropped in 2023 after an agreement was reached between the high-speed rail and airport authorities.

== Facilities ==
Hollywood Burbank Airport covers 555 acres (224 ha) at an elevation of 778 feet (237 m) above sea level. It has two asphalt runways: 15/33 is 6,886 by 150 feet (2,099 x 46 m) and 8/26 is 5,802 by 150 feet (1,768 x 46 m). Airliners generally take off on Runway 15 due to wind from the south, and land crosswind on Runway 8 since that is the only runway with ILS and clear terrain for the approach. Flights from the northeast rarely land visually on Runway 15 to save the extra distance circling to Runway 8. When the wind is from the north aircraft make a visual approach over the Santa Monica mountains for a left-base to final turn to Runway 33.

In the year ending February 28, 2023, the airport had 151,916 operations, average 416 per day: 45% scheduled commercial, 36% general aviation 19% air taxi, and &lt;1% military. At that time, 81 aircraft were then based at this airport: 42 jet, 22 single-engine, 6 multi-engine, and 11 helicopter.

Hollywood Burbank Airport also has its own Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) station, which is housed in a hangar in the northwest quadrant of the airport. In addition to providing emergency services to support airport operations, the department supports the airport AED program, fire extinguisher inspections and training, in addition to inspections and emergency support for all airport structures. Beginning in 2012, the Burbank–Glendale–Pasadena Airport Authority equipped its ARFF with Rosenbauer Panther 1500 vehicles. Burbank was the first airport in the US to operate state-of-the-art Class 4 ARFF vehicles employing compressed air foam (CAF) technologies, which provide enhanced firefighting capabilities when paired with other tools like forward looking infrared (FLIR) and thermal imaging cameras (TICs). The airport operates with five firefighters and one captain, while FAA standards require Index C airports like Hollywood Burbank to have a minimum of two firefighters and one captain.

===Terminals===
Hollywood Burbank Airport has two terminals, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, joined as part of the same building. Terminal A has nine gates numbered A1 to A9, Terminal B has five gates numbered B1 to B5.

A new terminal facility broke ground in January 2024. The 355,000 square-foot facility is expected to replace BUR&#x27;s current 94-year-old terminal building in October 2026 and will have 14 gates and it will have one floor.

===Ground transportation===
Hollywood Burbank Airport can be reached using the Hollywood Way exit off Interstate 5 southbound, the Empire Avenue exit off Interstate 5 northbound, the Hollywood Way (westbound) or Pass Avenue (eastbound) exit off State Route 134, the Victory Boulevard exit off State Route 170, or the Barham Blvd (northbound) exit off U.S. Route 101. Car and pedestrian access to the terminal is provided at either Hollywood Way and Thornton Avenue or on Empire Avenue one block west of Hollywood Way. On-site parking consists of valet parking, short-term parking, and Parking Lots E and G. Remote Parking Lot A is located at Hollywood Way and Winona Avenue. Remote Parking Lot C is located on Thornton Avenue west of Ontario Street. Shuttle buses are provided from Parking Lots A and C to the terminal buildings. A shuttle stop is also located at the corner of Hollywood Way and Thornton Avenue.

Lyft, Uber, and Wingz all use the passenger drop-off location in front of the main terminal for departing travelers, and arrivals use the adjacent Short Term Parking structure directly opposite the terminal.

There are two bus stop areas: Hollywood Way–Thornton Avenue (a short walk east of Terminal A) and Empire Avenue/Intermodal, also known as the RITC, a short walk south of Terminal B across from the Burbank Airport-South station. All Burbank-bound lines serve the Downtown Burbank Metrolink station. Metro route 222 connects to the Universal City station. The Burbank Orange bus connects to North Hollywood station.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; and &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; serve the Burbank Airport–South station located south of the airport. The train station is a short walk from the terminal area via skybridge. Amtrak&#x27;s Pacific Surfliner provides access to San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles Union Station, Anaheim, and San Diego.

Twice daily Amtrak Thruway bus service on Empire Avenue across from the Burbank Airport–South station provides transportation to Santa Monica, UCLA, Van Nuys, Newhall, and Bakersfield.

Regional service Metrolink has two stops near the airport. The Antelope Valley Line stops at the Burbank Airport–North station located about one mile north of the terminal near the intersection of San Fernando Boulevard and Hollywood Way. This station has a free on-demand shuttle that takes passengers to the terminal; passengers can also board the Metro 294 bus for free with a Metrolink ticket. The second station is on the Metrolink Ventura County Line south of the terminal, along Empire Avenue, named Burbank Airport-South station. Both stations north and south, provide access to downtown Los Angeles, Ventura County and Antelope Valley, respectively.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On September 21, 1938, USAAC Chief Maj. Gen. Oscar Westover was killed in the crash of Northrop A-17AS, &quot;36-349&quot;, c/n 289, &#x27;1&#x27;, out of Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., in a crosswind short of the runway. The single-engine attack design, used as a high-speed staff transport, crashed into a house at 1007 Scott Road in Burbank. Also killed was Westover&#x27;s mechanic, S/Sgt Samuel Hymes. (Another source identifies him as Sgt. Samuel Hyne.) Northeast Air Base, Massachusetts, was renamed Westover Field on December 1, 1939, later Westover AFB on January 13, 1948. The location of the crash may indicate that Gen. Westover&#x27;s intended landing field was not Hollywood Burbank Airport (then Union Air Terminal), but a nearby landing field, Lockheed Aircraft Company Plant B-1 Airfield (34.189°N, 118.331°W), 1 mile southeast of Hollywood Burbank Airport, which existed from ca. 1928 until World War II. The site is now (2022) the Empire Center Shopping Center, with a Staples, Lowe&#x27;s, and Target where the runway had been.
* On August 6, 1945, leading U.S. fighter ace Richard Bong was killed when his plane&#x27;s primary fuel pump malfunctioned during takeoff on the acceptance flight of P-80A 44–85048. Bong either forgot to switch to the auxiliary fuel pump, or for some reason was unable to do so. Bong bailed out of the aircraft but was too low for his parachute to deploy. The plane crashed into a narrow field at Oxnard St &amp; Satsuma Ave, North Hollywood.
* On October 31, 1951, a Pacific Southwest DC-3 crashed shortly after take-off into Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery, immediately south of the airport. Though damaged, the fuselage remained intact and there were only very minor injuries.
* On September 8, 1955, Currey Air Transport Flight 24, a Douglas DC-3 bound for Oakland, crashed on the airport property while returning to the airfield after experiencing an engine failure shortly after takeoff. The plane, N74663, struck a power line on the southern boundary of the airport, causing it to crash into two parked Air Force C-54 aircraft and a Lockheed Aircraft service hangar. The pilot, co-pilot and an airport employee on the ground were killed; the plane&#x27;s stewardess and one passenger were seriously injured. The remaining 29 passengers on board received minor injuries.
* On December 14, 1962, a Flying Tiger Line Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation freighter (N6913C) crashed in dense fog miles west of the airport during an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 07. The Constellation clipped a telephone pole and billboard and crashed in an industrial and residential neighborhood near the intersection of Lankershim Boulevard and Vose Street in North Hollywood after the aircraft&#x27;s 38-year-old pilot suffered a heart attack at a critical point in the landing approach. All five occupants of the Constellation—the pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and two non-revenue passengers—died in the crash. Also killed were two persons in a commercial building and a teen-age girl in a house that were among the structures struck by the plane.
* On December 5, 1982, Douglas C-53 N163E operated by P. Crossman was damaged beyond repair in a taxiing accident.
* On March 5, 2000, Southwest Airlines Flight 1455, upon landing on Runway 8 at Burbank following a flight from Las Vegas, overran the runway, injuring 44. The Boeing 737 crashed through a metal blast barrier at the end of the runway, then an airport perimeter fence, and came to rest in the traffic lanes of Hollywood Way, a main north–south thoroughfare. The plane stopped near a Chevron gasoline station located across the street from the runway. The incident resulted in the dismissal of the pilots. The Chevron gasoline station was subsequently closed and removed due to safety concerns.
*On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292 took off from Burbank, and the nose gear failed to retract and instead jammed sideways. The aircraft spent several hours in the air before safely making an emergency landing at LAX, with 140 passengers and 6 crew members aboard. The Airbus A320 was originally bound for JFK International Airport, in New York City. After the aircraft took off, the incident was quickly captured by news helicopters which ran feed that was shown live nationally on cable news. Many passengers on the flight said they watched images of their own aircraft&#x27;s flight on JetBlue&#x27;s LiveTV system.
* On October 13, 2006, a Gulfstream Aerospace jet overran the runway upon landing. There were no reported injuries amongst the five passengers and two crew members. New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez was on board, en route to attend the funeral of teammate Cory Lidle. Rodriguez was uninjured, but the accident happened two days after the fatal plane crash of his teammate.
* On December 6, 2018, Southwest Airlines Flight 278 from Oakland overran the runway in heavy rain. The flight was stopped by the EMAS installed following the similar Southwest Airlines Flight 1455 incident in 2000.
* On February 22, 2023, a near mid-air collision was reported at the Hollywood Burbank Airport when a SkyWest Embraer 175 was cleared to takeoff on runway 33 and a Mesa Airlines CRJ-900 was cleared to land immediately after on the same runway. The accident was averted by initiating a go around and neither plane suffered any damages and there were no injuries for any passenger on board.

<text>Long Beach Airport is a public airport northeast of downtown Long Beach, in Los Angeles County, California, United States. It is also called Daugherty Field, named after local aviator Earl Daugherty. The airport was an operating base for JetBlue, but this ended on October 6, 2020, as the carrier moved its operating base to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), amidst the then-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, Southwest Airlines became the airport&#x27;s largest airline.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 1,413,251 passenger boardings in calendar year 2008, 1,401,903 in 2009 and 1,451,404 in 2010.

==Overview==

Located near the border between Los Angeles County and Orange County, Long Beach Airport serves the Los Angeles MSA. Due to its close proximity to the busier and larger LAX 20 miles away, the airport sees more domestic commercial passenger, cargo, military, and general aviation activity. The airport&#x27;s placement near many residential areas has led to it having one of the country&#x27;s strictest ordinances limiting airport noise.

It is the 10th busiest airport in California based on passenger boardings, at 1.4 million. As of May 2018, JetBlue operated the most airline flights out of Long Beach; the other airlines are American, Delta, Hawaiian, and Southwest. Air cargo carriers, including FedEx and UPS, also use LGB. 57,000 tons of goods are carried each year.

The Boeing Company (formerly McDonnell Douglas) maintains maintenance facilities for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas/Douglas aircraft (including the historic DC-9 and DC-10 aircraft) near the Long Beach Airport and produced the C-17 through 2015. The manufacturing facilities were leased to Mercedes-Benz and Relativity Space. Virgin Galactic established the satellite launch vehicles at the Long Beach Airport and operated by Virgin Orbit. Gulfstream Aerospace operates a completion/service center.

The Long Beach Airport has an aggressive noise abatement program, with three full-time noise specialists. Under Long Beach municipal law, the city can criminally prosecute the aircraft&#x27;s owner and the pilots for breaking the noise ordinance. As the airport continues to grow and air traffic increases, so do the complaints about loud and low-flying aircraft. The airport produces a monthly noise and complaint report.

Because of the noise abatement program, commercial (passenger or cargo) flights have been restricted since 1981, when a limit of 15 daily flights was instituted. As of 2023, 41 daily flights are permanent, and 17 flights are supplemental (which are adjusted each year depending on noise budget results), for a total limit of 58 flights per day. However, many other types of flights take place, including charters, private aviation, flight schools, law enforcement flights, helicopters, advertising blimps, and planes that tow advertising banners. Long Beach airport is one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world, with 398,433 aircraft movements in 2007.

Long Beach Airport has one terminal in Streamline Moderne style that is a historical landmark and was renovated in early 2013.

ATP Flight School operates a professional commercial pilot flight training program at Long Beach Airport/Daugherty Field.

==History==
The first transcontinental flight, a biplane flown by Calbraith Perry Rodgers, landed in 1911 on Long Beach&#x27;s sandy beach. From 1911 until the airport was created, planes used the beach as a runway.

Barnstormer Earl S. Daugherty had leased the area that later became the airport for air shows, stunt flying, wing walking and passenger rides. Later, he started the world&#x27;s first flight school in 1919 at the same location. In 1923 Daugherty convinced the city council to use the site to create the first municipal airport.

Douglas &quot;Wrong Way&quot; Corrigan used to fly regularly out of Daugherty Field. Before his infamous flight from Brooklyn, New York, to Ireland in 1938, he had flown from Long Beach to New York. After authorities refused his request to continue on to Ireland, he was supposed to return to Daugherty Field, but a claimed navigational error routed him to Ireland. He never publicly acknowledged having flown there intentionally.

The main terminal building was designed by architects William Horace Austin and Kenneth Smith Wing and was constructed in 1941.

The murals and mosaics were created by artist Grace Clements and completed in 1941, with the support of the Works Progress Administration. They depict aviation, navigation, and constellations.

In the 1940s and 1950s the only airline nonstops from Long Beach Airport were to Los Angeles, San Diego, and sometimes Catalina Island; in 1962 Western Airlines introduced a daily Electra to San Francisco and one a day to San Diego. Jet schedules began in 1968; in 1969 Western Boeing 737-200s flew to Las Vegas, Oakland, and San Francisco. In 1980 the only jets were Pacific Southwest Airlines flights to SFO.

Between 1990 and 1992 Continental, Delta, TWA, and USAir ended service to LGB, and American Airlines left in early 2006. Alaska Airlines later ended mainline service, and ended codeshare service in 2015. Delta Connection Regional jet flights continue at LGB. In February 2016 Southwest Airlines announced plans to begin service to the airport with an initial four available slots. On July 9, 2020, JetBlue announced that they would end service to the airport in October 2020, instead expanding their operations at nearby Los Angeles International Airport.

===Military use===
To attract the United States Navy, the City of Long Beach built a hangar and an administrative building and then offered to lease it to the Navy for $1 a year for the establishment of a Naval Reserve air base. On May 10, 1928, the U.S. Navy commissioned the field as a Naval Reserve air base (NRAB Long Beach). Two years later the city built a hangar and administrative building for the United States Army Air Corps as well. Significant developments to the little city airport began only after the city built hangars and administrative facilities for the Army and Navy in 1928–30.

As a Naval Reserve Air Base, the mission was to instruct, train and drill Naval Reserve personnel. A ground school was offered three nights a week at the base and two nights a week at the University of California in Los Angeles until 1930, when ground school was continuously offered at the base. On April 9, 1939, training in night flight began, and shortly thereafter its facilities began to be used by fleet aircraft as well.

With increased activity by airlines and the private airplane industry, particularly with Douglas Aircraft showing an interest in the Long Beach Municipal Airport, the facility needed more space. With Douglas Aircraft as a resident, the attitude of Long Beach&#x27;s authorities became openly hostile to naval aviation, with its city manager saying that &quot;the sooner the Navy gets out of the Long Beach airport, the better we will like it.&quot;

The Navy began a survey for another site, unknown to city officials at the time. Admiral Ernest J. King, then the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, and Admirals William D. Leahy, Joseph K. Taussig, and Allen E. Smith pointedly requested that the city of Long Beach repair the runways and reminded the city that the Pacific Fleet, then lying offshore in Long Beach and San Pedro harbors, had a payroll of more than $1 million a month. Eventually, the city complied with the Navy&#x27;s requests.

The city remained hostile toward approving a lease on any additional land that the Naval Reserve now required.

The Navy, fed up with the city of Long Beach, decided upon the purchase of some property owned by a Mrs. Susanna Bixby Bryant, a fact made known by the commander of the base, Commander Thomas A. Gray, to the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Admiral John H. Towers. The circumstances behind the purchase were revealed to James V. Forrestal, Under Secretary of the Navy, and by him to the House Naval Affairs committee who approved the purchase. Although Comdr. Gray had offered Mrs. Bryant $350 an acre, in the best patriotic spirit she sold the property at $300 an acre.

With the site acquired, in 1941, construction funds soon followed and NAS Los Alamitos began to take shape. Upon the transfer of the Naval Reserve Training Facility to Los Alamitos, to the surprise of city officials of Long Beach, in 1942, instead of returning the Naval Reserve Air Base facilities at Long Beach to the city, the Navy turned over the facilities to the United States Army Air Forces, which had established a training base next to it. NARB Long Beach was not totally abandoned but became a Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS).

Through World War II the airfield was given over to the war effort. In August 1941 the Civil Aeronautics Administration took over control of the airport, which had grown to . Once Los Alamitos became an operational base in 1941, NAAS Long Beach now turned to servicing carrier-borne F4Fs, SBDs, FM-2s, F4Us, F6Fs, TBF/TBMs, and SB2Cs. In addition, it had utility aircraft and such patrol planes as the PBY, SNB, GB3, NH, GH, and SNJ.

As the Navy&#x27;s activities began to be shifted to Los Alamitos, the Long Beach Army Airfield at Long Beach became the home of the Army&#x27;s Air Transport Command&#x27;s Ferrying Division, with the 1736th Ferrying Squadron assigned, which included a squadron of 18 women pilots commanded by Barbara London, a long time Long Beach aviator.

Like the Naval Air Ferry Command at NAS Terminal Island, the Army&#x27;s ferrying work was an immense undertaking, thanks to Douglas Aircraft&#x27;s wartime production. Ground was broken for the initial Douglas Aircraft facility in November 1940, with dedication in October 1941. Douglas had been drawn to Long Beach&#x27;s growing municipal airport with its Army and Navy facilities. With wartime contracts, the company went into intensive production. The company&#x27;s first C-47 was delivered 16 days after the attack of Pearl Harbor and another 4,238 were produced during the war. The plant turned out some 1,000 A-20 Havocs, not to mention 3,000 B-17 Flying Fortresses and 1,156 A-26 Invaders.

With the end of the war the U.S. Navy abandoned any use of Long Beach Municipal Airport and with it the designation of Long Beach as a Naval Auxiliary Air Station.

==Facilities==

Long Beach Airport covers 1,166 acres (472 ha) at an elevation of 60 feet (18 m). It has three asphalt runways:

On December 12, 2012, the Long Beach Airport completed a $136 million improvement project designed to modernize the main terminal without sacrificing its historic Art Deco architecture or reputation among travelers for convenience. It was developed to improve the customer experience by providing resort-like amenities, having a central palm garden, outdoor dining areas with fire pits, wine bars, and 11 gates. A new 2,000-space parking structure was completed ahead of schedule and below budget. $5 million was spent to refurbish the old terminal, which was originally built in 1941 and declared a historic landmark by the city decades later. The new terminal retains the open-air feeling of the current terminal complex, and passengers still walk across the tarmac when boarding or leaving their planes. The baggage claim also is partially enclosed, as it was before.

In February 2020, the Long Beach City Council approved of a new $80-million Phase II improvement project. The project includes a new ticketing building and the seismic retrofit of the historic terminal building. The project also includes moving the rental car area into the historical terminal building, new baggage claim areas, and a new meet-and-greet area. Design and construction began in 2020 and will continue through early 2024.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On November 18, 1950, a Trans World Airlines Lockheed L-049 Constellation, after departing Los Angeles International Airport had a malfunction of the #3 then #2 engine and both props were feathered. An instrument approach was attempted at LGB, however, the runway was not visible until halfway down the runway, and the brakes were not effective on the wet, slippery surface. The aircraft ran through a fence and over a spur railroad track, collapsing the right gear, and coming to a stop 1400 feet from the runway. All 60 passengers and crew survived. The plane was substantially damaged but repaired and placed back into service. However, nearly 11 years later, this particular aircraft was destroyed in an accident on September 1, 1961, as TWA Flight 529.
*On December 16, 1956, a Zantop Air Transport Curtiss C-46 Commando made a straight-in visual flight rules (VFR) approach to LGB when encountering an area of ground fog, impacted the ground. All four occupants survived, but the aircraft was destroyed and written off.
*On March 16, 2011, a privately owned Beechcraft King Air crashed shortly after takeoff, killing five people and injuring another. The NTSB determined the cause of the crash to be a result of poor pilot technique that failed to maintain aircraft control, following a momentary interruption of power to the left engine caused by water contamination of the fuel. The NTSB found the water contamination was allowed to build up in the aircraft&#x27;s fuel sumps due to poor maintenance and pre-flight practices, and a lack of communication between the pilot and aircraft mechanics over who was responsible for draining the sumps before each flight. Because of this, enough water was allowed to build up in the fuel sumps to initiate this accident.

<text>Ontario International Airport is an international airport east of downtown Ontario, in San Bernardino County, California, United States, about east of downtown Los Angeles and west of downtown San Bernardino. It is owned and operated under a joint-powers agreement with the city of Ontario and San Bernardino County.

The airport covers and has two parallel runways. It is the West Coast air and truck hub for UPS Airlines and is a major distribution point for FedEx Express. , ONT has more than 64 daily departures and arrivals. Since Ontario&#x27;s longest runway (runway 8L/26R) is longer than three of the four runways at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), it is an alternate landing site for large aircraft destined for LAX.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1923, a landing field was established east of Central Avenue ( west of the current airport) on land leased from the Union Pacific Railroad. The airfield was named Latimer Field after an orange-packing company next to the airstrip. An airport was built there by one of the first flying clubs in Southern California, the Friends of Ontario Airport. In 1929, the city of Ontario purchased , now in the southwest corner of the airport, for , and established the Ontario Municipal Airport.

In 1941, the city bought around the airport and approved construction of new runways, which were completed by 1942, with funds from the Works Progress Administration. The east–west runway and the northeast–southwest runway cost . On 27 February 1942, an Army Air Corps plane made the first landing at the new airport. By 1943, the airport was an Army Air Corps Lockheed P-38 Lightning training base and North American P-51 Mustang operating base.

After the war, it was one of the five large storage, sales, and scrapping centers for Army Air Forces aircraft established by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; others were at Albuquerque AAF, New Mexico; Altus AAF, Oklahoma; Kingman AAF, Arizona; and Walnut Ridge AAF, Arkansas.

===Ontario International Airport===

In 1946, Ontario Municipal Airport was renamed &quot;Ontario International Airport&quot; because of the trans-Pacific cargo flights originating there. On 17 May 1946, two Army surplus steel hangars arrived at the airport, which the Ontario city council had authorized the $50,000 purchase of just the previous week. City officials were pleased to have secured a bargain. Thought to be the only pair available in the U.S., City Manager Harold J. Martin observed that even if they could be acquired at a later date, the cost would be several times that afforded by prompt action. A Pacific Overseas Airlines flight from Shanghai arrived at Ontario on 18 May 1946, &quot;which inaugurated regular round-trip air passenger service between the United States and the Orient.&quot; In 1949, Western Airlines began scheduled flights; in 1955, Bonanza Air Lines flights started. Western and Bonanza nonstops did not reach beyond Las Vegas. In 1962, Western began nonstop flights to San Francisco (one Electra daily). In 1967, Bonanza began nonstop F27 flights to Phoenix.

Ontario and Los Angeles entered into a joint-powers agreement, making Ontario International Airport part of the Los Angeles regional airports system in 1967. In 1968, the airport had its first scheduled jet flights. In 1969, Continental Airlines started Boeing 720B nonstops to Denver and Chicago; Air California started Boeing 737 flights to San Jose; Pacific Southwest Airlines started San Francisco flights; and Western began 737 nonstops to Sacramento and Salt Lake City. In 1970, United Airlines started a nonstop to Chicago and American started flights to Dallas (and Chicago, for a short time). In September 1986, Ontario hosted the Concorde supersonic airliner during a promotional round-the-world flight.

In 1981, a second east–west runway, 26L/8R, was built, necessitating the removal of the old NE-SW runway 3/21. Remnants of the 3/21 runway are visible in the present-day taxiways. With the completion of the new runway, the existing runway 25/7 became 26R/8L. In 1985, the city of Los Angeles acquired Ontario International Airport outright from the city of Ontario. In 1987, Runway 26R/8L was extended to the east to bring the two runway thresholds side by side, so aircraft would be higher over neighborhoods. 26R/8L became the main departing runway and 26L/8R the main arrival runway.

For a number of years, the airport operated alongside Ontario Air National Guard Station, which was closed as a result of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.

In 1998, the new and larger airport terminal opened, designed by DMJM Aviation. Two older terminals, west of the current terminal, the main terminal and a small terminal were discontinued when the new Terminal 2 and Terminal 4 facilities were opened. The old terminals currently house the administration and the USO.

In 2005 and 2006, runway 26R/8L was repaved and strengthened, and received storm drains and better runway lighting, and additional improvements to taxiway intersections were made.

In 2006, Ontario International Airport became LA/Ontario International Airport. The &quot;LA&quot; portion was added to remind fliers of Greater Los Angeles and to avoid confusion with the province of Ontario in Canada.

The airport&#x27;s traffic peaked in 2005 with 7.2 million passengers, and remained steady through 2007. Around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, JetBlue suspended service to ONT, and major legacy carriers significantly decreased their passenger volume at the airport. Southwest Airlines transferred a significant portion of its Ontario capacity to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), making LAX fares more competitive with ONT, while being coupled with more attractive frequencies and a wider range of destinations. The surrounding Inland Empire region was hit hard by the financial crisis, with the nearby city of San Bernardino declaring bankruptcy. The airport suffered a 40% decline in traffic between 2007 and 2012, during which time traffic at LAX recovered to surpass prerecession levels.

===Ontario International Airport Authority===
Ownership and control of the airport became an issue in late 2010, when the city of Ontario, supported by the Southern California Association of Governments, criticized and questioned LAWA&#x27;s operation of the airport. A group of local government officials, led by Ontario city council member Alan Wapner, began a campaign to transfer control of the airport away from Los Angeles World Airports. Wapner argued that the City of Los Angeles had no interest in maintaining service at an airport well beyond its borders. In 2013, LAWA offered to return the airport to local control for a purchase price of $474M, which was rejected. Local groups then sued the city of Los Angeles, a suit that was temporarily suspended when both sides agreed to attempt to work together.

In 2015, Los Angeles World Airports agreed to turn over ownership of Ontario Airport to the city of Ontario. LAWA was &quot;to be reimbursed for its investments in the facility, job protection for the facility&#x27;s 182 employees and the settlement of a lawsuit in which Ontario sought to regain control of the airport. Upon transfer of ownership, the airport would be operated by the Ontario International Airport Authority, formed under a joint-powers agreement between the city of Ontario and San Bernardino County&quot;. The Ontario International Airport Authority took over control of operations in November 2016, and the airport&#x27;s operating name was reverted to Ontario International Airport, since the City of Los Angeles no longer oversaw operations of the airport.

The airport&#x27;s continuing traffic decline reversed in early 2017, when the airport experienced faster growth than LAX for the first time since 2007. On September 30, 2017, it was announced that China Airlines would begin nonstop flights from Ontario to Taipei, which started in spring 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;DB 2019/11/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2023, New Pacific Airlines (formerly known as Northern Pacific Airways) commenced operations and made its first flight to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada, and started flights to Reno–Tahoe International Airport, also in Nevada, and Nashville International Airport in Tennessee. Also on that day, Volaris added flights to El Salvador. On January 1, 2024, they ended flights to Las Vegas and subsequently discontinued all scheduled service altogether.

==Facilities==

===Terminals===
Ontario International Airport has two terminals with 26 gates and a separate adjacent international arrivals facility with 2 arrival-only gates, totaling 28 gates.
Terminal 2 has and 12 gates. Alaska Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, and Volaris are located in Terminal 2.

Terminal 4 has and 14 gates. American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest Airlines are located in Terminal 4.

The international arrivals facility has two gates for arrivals only, containing the airport&#x27;s U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility. International flights depart from the main terminals. Avianca, China Airlines, and Volaris are the only airlines with international arrivals that operate this terminal.

A USO is housed in the old terminal complex near the international arrivals facility.

Remote parking is located on the east end of the airport (moved from its former location at the west end). On the east end is a ground transportation center that consolidates the rental car companies in one central location. The Omnitrans 61 bus traverses the airport, providing connections to each of the terminals, rental car and remote parking lots, and public transit stops.

General aviation is located at the south side of the airport, although most general-aviation pilots tend to use a number of nearby airports: Redlands Municipal Airport, Chino Airport, Brackett Field in La Verne, Cable Airport in Upland, or San Bernardino International Airport.

===Curfew and noise restrictions===
Ontario has few noise restrictions/abatement rules, unlike other Southern California airports, such as John Wayne Airport, Hollywood Burbank Airport (Bob Hope), Long Beach Airport, and San Diego International Airport, which all have very strict policies. The airport is allowed to operate 24/7, but during the hours of 22:00 to 07:00, all aircraft must arrive from the east on runway 26L or 26R and take off to the east on runway 8R or 8L, depending on ATC instruction. This procedure is known as &quot;Contra-Flow&quot; operations and applies to turbojet or turbofan aircraft. This procedure is similar to the one employed by LAX, where all landings are conducted from the east and all takeoffs are to the west (known as &quot;over-ocean&quot; operations) between 00:00 and 06:30. Both of these procedures are employed as long as weather and/or construction activity permits. This is done in an effort to be better neighbors and minimize the noise impact to the surrounding communities as much as possible. Residents of cities west of the airport have complained of increased noise as a result of the airport&#x27;s refusal to abide by noise abatement rules.

==Ground transportation==

The airport is located about east of downtown Los Angeles, west of downtown San Bernardino, and northwest of downtown Riverside. Motorists can use the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10), Ontario Freeway (Interstate 15), or the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60).

Omnitrans, San Bernardino County&#x27;s main public transportation agency, operates three routes near the airport. Route 380, also called ONT Connect, provides non-stop daily service every 35 to 60 minutes between the airport and Rancho Cucamonga station, where passengers can connect to Metrolink&#x27;s San Bernardino Line, which operates daily with service to Los Angeles Union Station. Route 61 operates daily between Pomona–Downtown station, Ontario station, the airport, and Fontana station. Both routes 61 and 380 operate from stops located east of baggage claim at terminals 2 and 4. Route 81 operates Monday through Saturday on Haven Avenue which runs along the eastern edge of the airport between Chaffey College and Ontario–East station, where passengers can connect to Metrolink&#x27;s Riverside Line, which operates during weekday peak periods.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On December 25, 1945, a USAAF Douglas C-47 was stolen by two non-pilot ground members. It crashed four miles east of the airport, killing both occupants.
* On January 15, 1969, a Pacific Southwest Airlines Boeing 727-100, N973PS, collided with Cessna 182 N42242 while it was climbing to its cruising altitude.

<doc id="250478" wikidata="Q752432" url="?curid=250478" title="Lord Edgware Dies">
<text>Lord Edgware Dies is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in September 1933 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year under the title of Thirteen at Dinner. Before its book publication, the novel was serialised in six issues (March–August 1933) of &quot;The American Magazine&quot; as &quot;13 For Dinner&quot;.

The novel features Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings and Chief Inspector Japp. An American actress married to Lord Edgware asks Poirot to aid her in getting a divorce from her husband. Poirot agrees to help her, meeting her husband. That evening, the actress is seen at a dinner with thirteen guests, which has an associated superstition. By the next morning Lord Edgware and another American actress are found murdered, each at their own homes. Poirot investigates.

The novel was well received at publication, in both London and New York, noting the clue that came from the chance remark of a stranger, calling it ingenious. A later review called it clever and unusual.

==Plot summary==
Attending a performance by impressionist Carlotta Adams, Hercule Poirot is approached by actress Jane Wilkinson. She requests his help in asking her husband, Lord Edgware, to divorce her. Although a Catholic, Poirot agrees but is surprised to learn Edgware has already agreed to a divorce and sent a letter to his wife confirming this; Wilkinson denies receiving it. The following morning, Inspector Japp informs Poirot and his friend Arthur Hastings that Edgware had been murdered at his home in Regent Gate the previous evening, stabbed in the neck. While Wilkinson was witnessed by Edgware&#x27;s butler and his secretary visiting her husband that night, a morning newspaper reveals she attended a dinner party the same evening, and other guests confirm this. Poirot soon becomes concerned for Adams&#x27; safety, recalling she could impersonate Wilkinson. Adams is found dead that same morning from an overdose of Veronal.

Seeking answers, Poirot notes a few facts: Bryan Martin, a former lover of Wilkinson before she met the wealthy Duke of Merton, bitterly describes her as an amoral person; Donald Ross, a guest at the party, witnessed her take a telephone call from someone that night; Adams possessed a pair of pince-nez, along with a gold case that contained the drug, which has a puzzling inscription in it; Edgware&#x27;s nephew, Ronald Marsh, had been cut off from his allowance by his uncle three months earlier; a sum of francs formerly in Edgware&#x27;s possession has disappeared, along with the butler. Learning Adams had sent a letter to her sister in America before her death, Poirot makes a request for it. A copy is sent via telegram, revealing Adams was offered $10,000 for an undisclosed endeavour. Poirot suspects she was hired to impersonate Wilkinson.

Japp soon arrests Marsh, based on this letter. Marsh denies hiring Adams or killing his uncle but states that he and his cousin Geraldine went to Regent Gates on the night of the murder, where he spotted Martin entering the house although Geraldine did not as she was retrieving something for him. Poirot later receives the original letter in the post and notes some oddities with it. Hastings attends a luncheon party along with Wilkinson and Ross, in which the guests talk about Paris of Troy. Wilkinson presumes they are talking of the French capital and begins discussing fashion. Ross, puzzled by this, considering how clever Wilkinson had been the last time he met her, confides his concerns to Hastings. He later telephones Poirot but is fatally stabbed before he can explain in detail. Seeking a theory, Poirot overhears a chance remark from a crowd leaving a theatre, which leads him to talk with Ellis, Wilkinson&#x27;s maid.

Gathering the suspects together, Poirot reveals that the killer in all three murders is Jane Wilkinson. Her motive in killing Lord Edgware is that the devout Duke of Merton would not marry a divorced woman. A widow, however, is a different matter. She recruited Adams to impersonate her at the dinner party, while she killed her husband and then killed Adams afterwards with a fatal dose of Veronal. The women met at a hotel to exchange clothing before and after the party. While waiting for Adams to return from the party, Wilkinson discovers a letter among Adams&#x27;s belongings that had yet to be posted and tampers with the letter to implicate the last man it mentions for the murders. Ross was killed because he realised that Wilkinson did not attend the dinner party; her ignorance of Greek mythology gave her away, as Adams had been knowledgeable on the subject and thus talked about it while impersonating her.

Poirot reveals what led him to his theory: Wilkinson lied about receiving her husband&#x27;s letter and used Poirot to prove she had no motive for his murder; the telephone call to Adams was to confirm if their deception had yet to be exposed; the pince-nez, belonging to Ellis, used in a disguise that she and Wilkinson wore to keep their hotel meetings secret; the gold case was created a week before the murder, not six months as its inscription implied - Wilkinson had it made under a false name and then sent Ellis to collect it; a corner of a page in Adams&#x27; letter was torn by Wilkinson, changing the word &quot;she&quot; to &quot;he&quot;, to imply that a man hired Adams. Poirot reveals that the butler stole the missing money; Marsh had witnessed him entering Regent Gates to hide it elsewhere; his disappearance was because he panicked when the police sought another suspect.

Wilkinson is arrested and writes to Poirot from prison about wishing an audience for her hanging, surprisingly evincing no anger at being foiled by him - nor any remorse.

==Characters==
* Hercule Poirot - The famed Belgian detective. Drawn into the case, after being asked by Wilkinson to aid her in getting a divorce from her husband.
* Captain Hastings - Poirot&#x27;s friend and assistant on the case. He is the narrator of the story.
* Inspector Japp - The investigating officer for the case.
* Lord Edgware - The first victim of the case. A wealthy English peer with a harsh personality, who is a noted collector of objets d&#x27;art. 
* Carlotta Adams - An American impersonator conducting a tour in London and Paris. Hired to impersonate Edgware&#x27;s wife by an unknown employer.
* Donald Ross - A young actor who attends the dinner party Wilkinson joins.
* Jane Wilkinson - A beautiful but amoral American actress and Edgware&#x27;s estranged wife. 
* Geraldine Marsh - Edgware&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage.
* Captain Ronald Marsh - Edgware&#x27;s nephew and heir to his title. 
* Genevieve &quot;Jenny&quot; Driver - Adams&#x27; friend in London. 
* Bryan Martin - A successful actor who worked with Wilkinson and was recently in love with her.
* Miss Carroll - Edgware&#x27;s housekeeper. 
* Alton - Edgware&#x27;s butler.
* Ellis - Wilkinson&#x27;s personal maid at her new accommodation.
* Duke of Merton - A devout Anglo-Catholic, and the current love of Jane Wilkinson, whom he plans to marry.
* Dowager Duchess of Merton - The Duke&#x27;s mother, vehemently opposed to his planned marriage to Jane Wilkinson.

==Alternative title==

&quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; is alternatively titled &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot;. This second title, used on American editions, arises from a superstition that sitting down thirteen to dinner means bad luck to the person who first leaves the table. The dinner at which Carlotta successfully impersonated Jane Wilkinson had an unexpected missing guest, leaving them thirteen instead of the invited fourteen. The superstition weighs heavily on young actor Donald Ross, but plays out for both him and Jane Wilkinson, and her impersonator.

==Literary significance and reception==
The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 21 September 1933 reviewed the book positively, commenting on the fact that &quot;it was the chance remark of a stranger in the street that put him on the right track. Three such murders, however, are enough to tax the powers of the most superhuman sleuth, and we do not grudge him one stroke of good fortune.&quot;

Isaac Anderson concluded his review in the 24 September 1933 issue of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; by saying, &quot;This story presents a most ingenious crime puzzle and a still more ingenious solution, all set forth with the consummate skill of which Agatha Christie is mistress.&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;Deals with a social/artistic milieu rather off Christie&#x27;s usual beat: aristocrats, actresses, socialites, rich Jews. The anti-Semitism is more muted than in the early thrillers, but still leaves a nasty taste (this is the last book in which it obtrudes). Otherwise clever and unusual, with the Hastings/Poirot relationship done less crudely than usual.&quot;

==References to other works==
In chapter 19, the Duchess of Merton tells Poirot that Lady Yardly had told her about him. Lady Yardly had previously appeared in the short story, &quot;The Adventure of the Western Star&quot; from the &quot;Poirot Investigates&quot; collection.

==References to actual history, geography and current science==
The character of Carlotta Adams was based on the American dramatist Ruth Draper (1884–1956). In her &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Christie says, &quot;I thought how clever she was and how good her impersonations were; the wonderful way she could transform herself from a nagging wife to a peasant girl kneeling in a cathedral. Thinking about her led me to the book &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot;.” Draper was also the inspiration for a character in the short story &quot;The Dead Harlequin&quot;, published in &quot;The Mysterious Mr. Quin&quot; (1930), where the character was called Aspasia Glen and was the murderer&#x27;s accomplice, rather than the victim.

In Chapter 7, Chief Inspector Japp mentions the Elizabeth Canning case which was a real kidnapping case that occurred in London in 1753. The case created a sensation at the time due to the inconsistencies in the victim&#x27;s declarations and the alibis of the perpetrators. Japp mentions this case due to the peculiar fact that the suspect was seen at two places at the same time. In the novel Lady Edgware was seen at a dinner party at the same time that she was also seen visiting the victim. Similarly, in the Canning case the suspect, Mary Squires, was seen travelling at the time that Elizabeth Canning said that she had been imprisoned by her.

==Adaptations==

===Radio===
John Moffatt starred as Poirot in a five-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation by Michael Bakewell directed by Enyd Williams and also starring Simon Williams as Captain Hastings and Nicola Pagett as Jane Wilkinson.

===Film===

The novel was first adapted in 1934 as an eighty-minute film directed by Henry Edwards for Real Art Productions. The film was the third to star Austin Trevor in the role of Poirot after his appearances in &quot;Alibi&quot; and &quot;Black Coffee&quot;, both in 1931.

===Television===
;1985 adaptation

The novel was first adapted for television as an eighty-seven-minute film in 1985, under the American version&#x27;s title &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot;. It starred Peter Ustinov in one of his six appearances as Hercule Poirot, David Suchet as Chief Inspector Japp, and co-starred Faye Dunaway in the dual role of Jane Wilkinson and Carlotta Adams. The adaptation updated the setting of the story to contemporary times, rather than within the 1930s.

;2000 adaptation
A second television adaptation of &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; was created in 2000, as an episode for the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; on 19 February 2000. It starred David Suchet in the role of Hercule Poirot, and was produced by Carnival Films. While remaining faithful to most of the plot of the novel, it featured a number of changes.

The adaptation changed the setting to a theatre in the city of Amiens, France, in the 1950s, made changes in a number of characters – Christie&#x27;s detectives were replaced by &quot;Commissaire&quot; Larosière (Antoine Duléry) and his clumsy assistant, &quot;Inspecteur&quot; Lampion (Marius Colluci), while the killer is glamorous actress Sarah Morlant (Maruschka Detmers), and the victim is Morlant&#x27;s inconvenient husband, fellow actor Pierre Fougère (Jean-Marie Winling) – and featured an additional murder subplot involving the theatre&#x27;s concierge.

===Book dedication===
The dedication of the book reads:
&quot;To Dr. and Mrs. Campbell Thompson&quot;

Reginald Campbell Thompson (21 August 1876 – 23 May 1941), married to Barbara, was an eminent British archaeologist and the second expedition leader to employ Christie&#x27;s husband Max Mallowan to work on one of his digs. The offer of work came in 1930 when Mallowan&#x27;s employer, Leonard Woolley, was proving difficult over his proposed marriage to Agatha and their wish that she should join her husband on the dig at Ur although the real opposition came from Leonard Woolley&#x27;s difficult wife, Katharine (see the dedication to &quot;The Thirteen Problems&quot;). Thompson&#x27;s dig was at Nineveh and Max joined the team there in September 1931 followed the next month by Agatha. The invitation was only confirmed after the Mallowans had joined Thompson for a weekend in the country near Oxford where they were subjected to a cross-country scramble on &quot;the wettest day possible over rough country&quot; followed by another test to ensure that neither Agatha nor Max were fussy eaters. These were to ensure that both could withstand the rigours of a season in the wilds of Iraq. Used to walking over Dartmoor and having a very healthy appetite, Agatha passed the tests with flying colours.

The relationship between the Mallowans and the Thompsons was far more relaxed than it had been with the Woolleys. The only source of contention was that Thompson was notoriously frugal with money and questioned every expense. Horses were a vital part of the expedition but Thompson only bought poor, badly-trained animals. He nevertheless insisted that Max ride them with skill since to fall off one would mean that &quot;not a single workman will have a scrap of respect for you&quot;. Christie&#x27;s clash with Thompson regarding this facet of his character was over her insistence on purchasing a solid table to place her typewriter on in order that she could complete her next book. Not seeing why she couldn&#x27;t use orange boxes, Thompson was aghast at her personal expenditure of ten pounds on a table at a local bazaar (although Max&#x27;s recollection in his own memoir was that three pounds was the sum.) and he took some two weeks to recover his temper over this &#x27;extravagance&#x27;. After this though, he made frequent polite enquiries over the progress of the book, &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot;, which was dedicated to him and his wife. A skeleton found on the dig was named &#x27;Lord Edgware&#x27;. A singular honour that Christie bestowed on the Thompsons was to read aloud the manuscript of the book to them, something that she normally only ever did to her family (See External Links below).

===Dustjacket blurb===
The blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads:
&quot;Supper at the Savoy! Hercule Poirot, the famous little detective, was enjoying a pleasant little supper party there as the guest of Lady Edgware, formerly Jane Wilkinson, a beautiful young American actress. During the conversation Lady Edgware speaks of the desirability of getting rid of her husband. Lord Edgware, since he refuses to divorce her, and she wants to marry the Duke of Merton. M. Poirot jocularly replies that getting rid of husbands is not his speciality. Within twenty-four hours, however, &quot;Lord Edgware dies&quot;. This amazing story once more reveals Agatha Christie as the perfect teller of Detective stories. It will be difficult indeed to lay down the book until one learns the true solution of the mystery.&quot;

<doc id="250479" wikidata="Q570947" url="?curid=250479" title="James Abercrombie (British Army officer, born 1706)">
<text>General James Abercrombie or Abercromby (1706 – 23 April 1781) of Glassaugh, Banffshire was a British Army general and Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1734 to 1754. He was commander-in-chief of forces in North America during the French and Indian War, best known for the disastrous British losses in the 1758 Battle of Carillon.

==Biography==
Abercrombie was born in Glassaugh, Banffshire, Scotland, the eldest son of Alexander Abercromby, also MP for Banffshire, and his wife Helen Meldrum. He was appointed an ensign in the 25th Regiment of Foot at age eleven. He married Mary Duff (sister of William Duff, 1st Earl Fife) and they had one daughter. At the 1734 British general election, he was returned by his brother-in-law, William Duff, later Lord Braco, as Member of Parliament for Banffshire. He voted regularly with the Government.

Abercrombie was promoted to captain in 1736, and by 1739 was lieutenant-governor of Stirling castle. He was re-elected MP for Banff at the 1741 British general election. In 1742, he purchased a major&#x27;s commission. He was promoted to colonel in 1746 and served in the Flemish Campaign of the War of Austrian Succession. He was quartermaster general under General James St Clair at the Raid on Lorient in 1746 and was wounded at Hulst in 1747. At the 1747 British general election, he was returned unopposed as MP for Banff as an Old Whig, but stood down in 1754 in favour of Lord Braco&#x27;s son, now of age.

With the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756, Abercrombie was promoted major general and ordered to America as second in command to Lord Loudoun for the upcoming campaigns against the French. Abercrombie commanded a brigade at Louisbourg in 1757 and became Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in North America after Loudoun&#x27;s departure in December.

In the summer of 1757, Abercrombie was ordered to lead an expedition against Fort Carillon (later known as Fort Ticonderoga), to prepare to take Montreal. Abercrombie was a genius at organization but vacillated in his leadership to the point where, after his defeat, he was called &quot;Mrs. Nanny Cromby&quot;. He managed the remarkable feat of assembling fifteen thousand troops at Fort Edward and moving them and their supplies through the wilderness. Then, after losing George Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe, his second-in-command, in a skirmish on 7 July while reconnoitring, he directed his troops on 8 July into a frontal assault on a fortified French position, without the benefit of artillery support. More than two thousand men were killed or wounded. Eventually his force panicked and fled, and he retreated to his fortified camp south of Lake George.

This disaster caused in September 1758 Abercrombie&#x27;s recall to Great Britain and his replacement by General Jeffery Amherst. Despite his failure, he was promoted to lieutenant general in 1759, and general in 1772.

<text>Paramount Network is an American basic cable television channel and the flagship property of the Paramount Media Networks division of Paramount Global, who operates it through the MTV Entertainment Group. The network&#x27;s headquarters are located at the Paramount Pictures studio lot in Los Angeles. The channel was originally founded by a partnership between radio station WSM and Westinghouse Broadcasting as [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN) and began broadcasting on March 7, 1983. 

It initially featured programming catering towards the culture of the Southern United States, including country music, variety shows, outdoors programming, and motor racing coverage (such as NASCAR). TNN was purchased by the Gaylord Entertainment Company in 1983. After Gaylord bought CMT in 1991, TNN&#x27;s music programming was shifted to CMT, leaving TNN to focus on entertainment and lifestyle programming.

In 1995, TNN and CMT were acquired by Westinghouse (owner of CBS), which was in turn acquired by Viacom in 1999. Under Viacom ownership, TNN would phase out country-influenced programming in favor of a general entertainment format appealing to Middle America. It was renamed The National Network in September 2000, coinciding with the network premiere of &quot;WWF Raw&quot;. In August 2003, TNN relaunched as Spike TV, which targeted a young adult male audience. From June 2006, the network&#x27;s programming had a more explicit focus on the action genre, while in 2010, the network had an increased focus on original reality series. This culminated with a final rebrand in 2015 to emphasize gender-balanced series (such as &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;) and a return to original scripted programming. 

On January 18, 2018, the channel took its current name, aiming to align the network with its Paramount Pictures (which previously lent its name to the United Paramount Network, which is now The CW), and to position Spike as a flagship, &quot;premium&quot; channel (similar to pay television networks HBO and Cinemax, which are both owned by Home Box Office, Inc.). Paramount Network&#x27;s most successful original program was &quot;Yellowstone—&quot;which quickly became its flagship series, and has spawned multiple spin-offs on Paramount+, the streaming service owned by its parent company Paramount Global. The network has also featured limited engagements of new Paramount+ original series by &quot;Yellowstone&quot; co-creator Taylor Sheridan, using &quot;Yellowstone&quot; as a lead-in. 

Between 2020 and 2021, most of Paramount Network&#x27;s original programming would either be cancelled, or moved to other Paramount Global outlets, as part of a proposed plan to relaunch the network with a focus on made-for-TV films. By January 2022, these plans had been scrapped due to the impact of COVID-19, and success of the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; franchise; leaving it, and Spike holdover &quot;Bar Rescue&quot;, as the channel&#x27;s only original, first-run programs. , approximately 61.33 million pay television households in the United States received Paramount Network; down from 80.24 million in September 2018.

== History ==

=== The Nashville Network (1983–2000) ===
The Nashville Network first launched on March 7, 1983; it was dedicated to the culture and lifestyle of country music and the Southern United States. It originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc., at the time owned by National Life and Accident Insurance Company, and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN&#x27;s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the &quot;first country music cable television network.&quot; TNN&#x27;s flagship shows included &quot;Nashville Now&quot;, &quot;The Statler Brothers Show&quot;, &quot;American Sports Cavalcade&quot; and &quot;Grand Ole Opry Live&quot;. &quot;Nashville Now&quot; and the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; were broadcast live from Opryland USA.

The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased WSM, along with TNN and the Opryland properties, in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN&#x27;s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment. From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN&#x27;s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.

Some of TNN&#x27;s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery, Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN&#x27;s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its &quot;The Nashville Network&quot; moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse&#x27;s successor.

=== The National Network, the New TNN, and professional wrestling (2000–2003) ===

In 1999, TNN began to downplay its previous country lifestyle programming to appeal to a wider demographic, including younger viewers; capitalizing on the success of &quot;RollerJam&quot; (a roller derby-inspired series with elements of professional wrestling), TNN reached a three-year deal to broadcast a weekly television series from the Philadelphia-based wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), which would air on Friday nights beginning in late August 1999. Under the contract, ECW also agreed to revenue sharing with TNN for all of the promotion&#x27;s events (including live shows and pay-per-views) and merchandising. These two programs would air as part of a Friday-night block themed around extreme sports programming, alongside &quot;Motor Madness&quot; and bull riding from the Professional Bull Riders (PBR); a TNN executive described bull riding as being &quot;the original extreme sport&quot;.

In November 1999, TNN announced new programming and primetime theme blocks it planned to introduce in 2000, including &quot;Movie Monday&quot; (which would target female viewers), &quot;Action Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Thrill Zone&quot;, &quot;Classic Country&quot; on Saturday nights, and &quot;TNN Outdoors&quot; on Sundays. The new schedule, along with new series such as the action drama &quot;18 Wheels of Justice&quot;, collegiate bowling competition series &quot;Rockin&#x27; Bowl&quot;, reruns of the Western anthology &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Gun&quot;, and a new promotional campaign targeting younger viewers, were intended to introduce a broader audience to the network.

Despite ECW reportedly driving a 200% increase in young male viewership in its timeslot, the promotion had a strained relationship with TNN&#x27;s management—which had given the program little advertising, among other issues. ECW would reference these difficulties in its storylines with its stable &quot;The Network,” whose leader Cyrus criticized the ECW program for its content, and showed a blatant adoration for TNN shows such as &quot;RollerJam&quot;.

On September 25, 2000, TNN was folded into the MTV Networks division based in New York City, and was renamed The National Network. The rebranding coincided with major changes to the network&#x27;s programming, including the network premiere of &quot;Raw Is War—&quot;the flagship weekly program of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE)&quot;—&quot;which moved to TNN from USA Network as part of a new contract with Viacom. As WWF programs were among USA Network&#x27;s top programs, the move was considered a major coup for TNN. MTV Networks chairman Tom Freston described TNN as now being a general entertainment service, albeit one with a &quot;sort of populist middle-America flavor&quot; rather than &quot;another network for New York or Los Angeles.&quot;

Football also became more prominent on the network, as it began airing games of the original Arena Football League (AFL) with Eli Gold as an announcer. TNN was also one of three networks to air games of the ill-fated, WWF-backed XFL (along with NBC and UPN). As part of its contract, TNN had the rights to a late Sunday afternoon game each week except for the first week, when UPN aired the afternoon game instead. In 2001, TNN aired CBS Sports-produced coverage of the inaugural opening round game of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The opening round game would later move to ESPN in 2002.

In 2001, TNN added off-network sitcoms and dramas such as &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; With Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot;. It also became the first channel to air reruns of &quot;MADtv&quot;. These moves went unnoticed for the most part, due to TNN&#x27;s lack of popularity. By this time, all country-western programming had been purged from the network; some of The Nashville Network&#x27;s former programming was picked up by CMT, while other classic TNN shows were picked up by Great American Country, including eventually the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, which was pushed off to CMT and eventually removed by Viacom after they did not renew the agreement to carry the series. In 2001, TNN began to market itself as &quot;The New TNN&quot;, an inadvertent pleonasm in its full context.

By late 2002, the channel had picked up more male-oriented shows, such as &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Monster Jam&quot;, the hidden camera game show &quot;Oblivious&quot;, &quot;Robot Wars Extreme Warriors,&quot; &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and &quot;Slamball&quot;.

=== Spike (2003–2018) ===

In April 2003, it was announced that TNN would be relaunched as Spike TV on June 16. Promoted with the slogan &quot;The First Network for Men&quot;, Viacom aimed to target young adult males aged 18–34 — a demographic they believed were being served insufficiently by other cable networks. Spike&#x27;s launch programming would include a slate of new adult animation series such as &quot;Gary the Rat&quot;, &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot; (an adult-oriented revival of the former Nickelodeon series &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, led by its original creator John Kricfalusi), and &quot;Stripperella&quot;, as well as other new series such as &quot;Ride with Funkmaster Flex&quot;, joined by its recent acquisitions &quot;CSI&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and &quot;Raw.&quot; Other planned programming included interstitial segments on health, technology, and finance in collaboration with &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, and MarketWatch.

Three days before the planned launch date, film director Spike Lee won a New York Supreme Court injunction preventing Viacom from using the name &quot;Spike TV.” Lee claimed that because of his well-known popularity in Hollywood, viewers would therefore assume that he was associated with the new channel. Lee stated in court papers that: &quot;The media description of this change of name, as well as comments made to me and my wife, confirmed what was obvious—that Spike TV referred to Spike Lee.&quot; Spike Jones Jr., son of comic musician Spike Jones, became a party to the lawsuit as part of Viacom&#x27;s defense to protect the rights to his father&#x27;s name.

Most of the new programming would premiere on the originally-planned date as a soft launch, at this time, the TNN name and logo was downplayed heavily in favor of the &quot;First Network for Men&quot; tagline. The suit was settled on July 8, 2003, in announcing the settlement, Lee admitted that he did not believe that the channel intentionally tried to trade on his name. On July 28, 2003, it was announced that Spike TV would officially launch on August 11, 2003—eight weeks later than initially scheduled. Its launch night programming featured two programs originally intended to air on June 16, including &quot;Party with Spike&quot;—a launch special filmed at the Playboy Mansion, and the premiere of &quot;Most Extreme Elimination Challenge&quot;—a comedic dub of the Japanese game show &quot;Takeshi&#x27;s Castle&quot;. Klasky Csupo&#x27;s &quot;Immigrants&quot; and the John Leguizamo-produced &quot;Zilch &amp; Zero&quot; were originally slated to run on Spike TV&#x27;s animation block, but these plans never materialized and the former was released as a film instead. Later that year, Spike premiered the reality television parody &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot;, and launched the Spike Video Game Awards.

On January 17, 2005, Spike TV premiered &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, a reality competition series following mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters training and competing to earn a contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). The series helped to raise the profile of the promotion, and would run for 14 seasons, ending its run in 2011 only after Fox Sports acquired the U.S. television rights to UFC programming and events under a new, seven-year deal.

In March 2005, Viacom announced that it would not renew its contract with WWE when it expired in September 2005. Spike TV&#x27;s new president, Doug Herzog, stated that Spike TV had planned to &quot;expand its investments in original programming and new acquisitions for its core audience&quot;, including new scripted programming. The following month, it was announced that &quot;WWE Raw&quot; would return to USA Network. Spike TV subsequently reached a deal with another wrestling promotion, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), which saw &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; premiere on Saturday, October 1, 2005. Later in the month, Spike TV debuted the video game news show &quot;Game Head&quot;, hosted by Geoff Keighley.

==== &quot;Get More Action&quot; ====

In 2005, Viacom conducted research which found that word-of-mouth knowledge narrowly perceived Spike TV&#x27;s programming as being predominantly &quot;low-brow,” violent, and reliant on sex appeal. These findings led Viacom to pursue a rebrand in an effort to clarify the network&#x27;s focus. At its upfront presentations in 2006, Viacom unveiled a new logo for the channel (officially shortening its name to &quot;Spike&quot;), and the new slogan &quot;Get More Action.” The new brand was described as being &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;unapologetically&quot; masculine, and emphasizing action as a core genre of programming for the network. The new branding would launch alongside the premiere of &quot;&quot; in June 2006. An aspect of the rebranding were themed promos with integrated product placement, such as &quot;Men of Action&quot; (which featured homages and parodies of &quot;classic action moments&quot;). 

On September 5, 2006, Spike premiered the documentary film &quot;Metal of Honor: The Ironworkers of 9/11&quot; by filmmaker Rachel Maguire, which profiled the ironworkers&#x27; efforts in the attempts for rescue and recovery following the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center site. The film proceeds through the ironworkers&#x27; dismantling of the fallen towers. On October 10, 2006, Spike aired the inaugural Scream Awards, an awards show honoring horror, science fiction, fantasy and comic book-based entertainment. In January 2007, Spike premiered the anime series &quot;Afro Samurai&quot;, whose English-language cast featured actor Samuel L. Jackson.

In October 2007, Kevin Kay was appointed network president after serving as executive vice president and general manager of the channel for the previous two years. The post had been vacant since December 2006. In 2008, the network premiered &quot;DEA&quot;, a reality series based on the Drug Enforcement Administration.

On April 7, 2008, Spike acquired cable syndication rights for the sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. Five new unscripted series were also picked up for the channel&#x27;s Summer 2008 lineup, including &quot;1000 Ways to Die&quot;.

In the fall of 2009, Spike broadcast live Australian rugby league semifinal games from the National Rugby League and also showed the grand final, as part of efforts by David Niu to bring the National Rugby League USA to the United States. On June 1, 2010, Spike launched into the first crowd-sourced pilot episode contest with Scripped, a web-based screenwriting community.

==== &quot;Get Real&quot; ====
In January 2011, Spike ordered two new reality television series, &quot;Bar Rescue&quot; and &quot;Repo Games&quot;. During Viacom&#x27;s upfronts presentation that May, it was announced that Spike would undergo a brand repositioning, with a larger focus on reality programming and a broader audience of males in the key demographic. The changes were intended to pivot Spike&#x27;s brand in a more mature direction, which were described as an aim to be less like &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine and more like &quot;Esquire&quot;. A promotional campaign emphasized adversity as a common theme in Spike&#x27;s programming.

The following year, Spike ordered the new series &quot;Rat Bastards&quot; (a series following a pest control business in Mississippi), &quot;Tattoo Nightmares&quot;, along with a revival of &quot;World&#x27;s Wildest Police Videos,&quot; and &quot;Full Bounty&quot;—a bounty hunting reality series that was later revealed to actually be a third season of &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot;. In 2013, Bellator MMA made its network debut with the premiere of its eighth season; the now Viacom-owned mixed martial arts promotion previously aired on sibling channel MTV2. Later that year, Fox reality series &quot;Cops&quot; moved to Spike beginning September 14. In the fall, kickboxing promotion Glory made its network debut with Glory 11: Chicago. This was not Spike&#x27;s first time broadcasting a kickboxing event as, in 2012, they partnered with K-1 to broadcast several events on their website. The end of the year saw the &quot;Video Game Awards&quot; revamped and become known as VGX.

At the end of the year, &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; would air its last episode on Spike on December 24, 2014, before moving to Destination America in 2015. Spike also announced that they would drop their video game award show; Geoff Keighley would go on to create his own award show in the form of &quot;The Game Awards&quot;. In January 2015, following a similar deal made by NBC, Spike announced they would air monthly fight cards by the &quot;Haymon Boxing&quot;-created &quot;Premier Boxing Champions.”

==== &quot;The Ones to Watch&quot; ====

During its upfronts on March 3, 2015, Spike unveiled a new logo and tagline, &quot;The Ones to Watch&quot;. The re-branding aimed to make Spike more inclusive to women, emphasizing a focus on &quot;big talent, engaging shows and hits that get people talking&quot; and further expansions into scripted series. Alongside the miniseries &quot;Tut&quot; and the announcement of an expanded episode order for the series &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; (a spin-off of a segment from &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;), Spike announced an output deal with Dwayne Johnson&#x27;s Seven Bucks Productions for a series of specials, &quot;Emergency Broadcast&quot;, an original drama co-created by Max Brooks, and &quot;Sweat Inc.&quot;, a fitness-oriented reality series hosted by Jillian Michaels.

=== Paramount Network (2018–present) ===
On February 9, 2017, Viacom announced that Spike would relaunch as Paramount Network in 2018 and move its headquarters from the One Astor Plaza in New York City to Paramount Pictures in Los Angeles to give the network a closer association with the film studio. This was part of a restructuring plan by new Viacom CEO Bob Bakish to refocus the majority of its media business around six flagship brands, which included Paramount Pictures, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, the Nick Jr. Channel, and MTV. New original series announced in the first half of 2018 included the miniseries &quot;Waco&quot; and &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, along with &quot;American Woman&quot; and &quot;Heathers&quot;—two comedies originally slated for TV Land. &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot;, which moved to Spike for season 2 from MTV, was not renewed by Paramount Network.

Paramount Network is being positioned as a &quot;premium&quot; basic cable network, similar to AMC and FX. Network president Kevin Kay explained that Bakish wanted Viacom to have a &quot;flagship&quot; outlet for scripted programming, as opposed to making inefficient investments into them across individual channels. He added that Paramount Network&#x27;s offerings would be distinguished from its competitors by continuing to emphasize Middle America as a key viewer base. Even with its subsequent rebrandings, Paramount Network still had significant carriage strength and viewership in the Midwest and South due to its heritage as TNN. Kay argued that its initial slate of original dramas were not as &quot;dark,” citing the setting of &quot;Yellowstone&quot; as making it &quot;brighter and a bit more blue sky than some of the things that are on premium cable TV now.”

In regards to the programs moved to Paramount Network from TV Land, &quot;American Woman&quot; was moved to take advantage of its prominent leads Alicia Silverstone and Mena Suvari, while &quot;Heathers&quot; was moved because, in Kay&#x27;s opinion, the show was not appropriate for TV Land&#x27;s target audience. In June 2018, &quot;Heathers&quot; was dropped by Paramount Network and Viacom, citing network concerns over the content of the series in the wake of recent shootings in the United States, such as the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The series would eventually air on Paramount Network in October 2018 in an edited form, with two episodes dropped due to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.

Paramount Network began a viral marketing campaign to promote its launch in December 2017. The campaign included a Times Square advertisement asking viewers to phone and email Paramount Network&#x27;s chief marketing officer Niels Schuurmans to protest Spike&#x27;s &quot;firing,” as well as a string of self-deprecating posts by the network&#x27;s Twitter account about its history and programming (including that &quot;My favorite number is 329 because it&#x27;s the number of times &quot;Cops&quot; is on every night,” &quot;We had a show called &quot;The Joe Schmo Show&quot;. Apparently every decent show name was taken&quot;, and that &quot;There&#x27;s a reason all our early shows were &quot;&quot;, UFC, TNA, &quot;MXC&quot;, UTI. No one around here knew how to read&quot;). A network executive stated that the campaign was meant to represent a &quot;public meltdown&quot; by a fired employee.

The campaign concluded with a live streaming event on January 17, 2018, where users could vote on various ways a crew would deface a large model of the former Spike logo, culminating in its demolition. Paramount Network officially launched the following night at 9:00 p.m. ET, marked by a live, Michael Jackson-themed &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; special from the Dolby Theatre.

The Spike trademark remains in active use as a series of channels on Paramount Global&#x27;s Pluto TV mainly carrying action and reality content.

==== Aborted rebrand as a movie network ====
In early 2020, Paramount Network began to cut back on scripted series development, having dropped upcoming projects such as &quot;Emily in Paris&quot; (which was subsequently picked up by Netflix), and cancelling &quot;68 Whiskey&quot; after a single season. On September 11, 2020, it was announced that Bellator would move to CBS Sports Network in October 2020. It would later move to Showtime in April 2021.

On September 22, 2020, ViacomCBS president of Entertainment and Youth Brands Chris McCarthy told &quot;Variety&quot; in an exclusive that Paramount Network would relaunch as a movie channel &quot;within the next year&quot; (to be tentatively known as Paramount Movie Network). The relaunched network was to focus primarily on original made-for-TV films featuring major talent, with a plan to premiere 52 films per-year. The films would have been largely produced by Paramount Pictures and MTV Studios, with plans for co-productions with ViacomCBS International networks such as Argentina&#x27;s Telefe, Australia&#x27;s Network 10, and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 5. These changes would have mirrored a similar shift in programming that McCarthy undertook at sister channel Comedy Central, which also dropped live-action series development in favor of original specials, films, and adult animation.

At least one scripted series or miniseries was to be carried per-quarter, such as &quot;Yellowstone&quot; (albeit with episodes premiering in a different format to suit a cinematic presentation), but the channel was to abandon non-scripted programming. In preparation for the relaunch, it was stated that &quot;Bar Rescue and Lip Sync Battle&quot; would move to another ViacomCBS channel to be determined, while &quot;Ink Master&quot; and &quot;Wife Swap&quot; were both cancelled.

Former Lifetime SVP of original movies Meghan Hooper White had been brought on as ViacomCBS&#x27;s head of original movies and specials in May 2020, and was to oversee the Paramount Movie Network slate, as well as television films and specials across all other ViacomCBS networks. However, she was released from the company in August 2021 as part of a reorganization of Paramount+ and MTV Entertainment Group&#x27;s executive structure. In the interim, new seasons of &quot;Bar Rescue&quot; and &quot;Yellowstone&quot; would premiere on the network in 2021, and in October 2021, the second season of &quot;The Last Cowboy&quot; (a reality competition series by &quot;Yellowstone&quot; co-creator Taylor Sheridan) moved to CMT. &quot;Ink Master&quot; was also picked up for a new season by Paramount+.

The channel also began a strategy of promoting new Paramount+ original series involving Sheridan, such as &quot;Mayor of Kingstown&quot; and &quot;Yellowstone&quot; prequel &quot;1883&quot;, under which their initial episodes were given special television airings on Paramount Network as lead-outs for &quot;Yellowstone&quot;. &quot;1883&quot; would set a record for the highest-rated premiere in Paramount Network history, and on cable overall since 2015, with 4.9 million viewers. McCarthy described this practice as a method of using its linear platforms as a &quot;launch pad&quot; for streaming content.

In January 2022, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that the network relaunch had been shelved, partly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television and film production, in addition to &quot;Yellowstone&quot;″s ratings success—which had been influenced by the acquisition of streaming rights to the series by NBCUniversal&#x27;s Peacock. The network also acquired linear rights to the Spectrum Originals series &quot;George &amp; Tammy&quot;. During the Paramount Global upfronts in May 2022, it was announced that &quot;Yellowstone&quot; spin-off &quot;6666&quot; had been shifted from Paramount+ to Paramount Network, the fifth season of &quot;Yellowstone&quot; would premiere in November 2022, and that the first two episodes of Sheridan and Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s Paramount+ series &quot;Tulsa King&quot; would receive special airings as lead-outs for &quot;Yellowstone&quot;.

== Programming ==
Paramount Network&#x27;s current programming consists primarily of reruns of sitcoms and drama series, as well as airings of feature films. As of 2022, the network&#x27;s lone original drama is &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, which launched alongside the rebranding of Spike as Paramount Network, and grew in viewership throughout its first four seasons. &quot;Bar Rescue&quot;, a reality series carried over from Spike, has also continued to air new episodes on Paramount Network.

As Spike, male-oriented programs constituted the majority of the network&#x27;s schedule upon its original relaunch in 2003. By 2011, Spike had shifted its programming towards shows aimed at a broader audience, such as &quot;Bar Rescue&quot;. Finally, with its 2015 rebrand, Spike attempted to add more &quot;gender-balanced&quot; programming.

The network had formerly carried combat sports programming throughout its various incarnations; being the first basic cable home of mixed martial arts promotion UFC, and including early seasons of the promotion&#x27;s reality series &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;. Other promotions and sports-related programming have included kickboxing events from Glory and K-1; professional wrestling from TNA Wrestling, WWE, and Extreme Championship Wrestling; boxing cards from Premier Boxing Champions; and the Paramount-owned Bellator MMA and Bellator Kickboxing.

== Website ==
On October 15, 2005, Viacom acquired iFilm, which was initially launched in 1997. After acquiring the website for $49 million, it was eventually rebranded to Spike.com and provided hosting of user-uploaded videos in a short-lived attempt to compete with YouTube (which Viacom had sued to remove user-generated uploads of its programming from), a strategy eventually abandoned to refocus Spike.com as a general network site. The iFilm.com domain redirected to the Screen Junkies website for a period of time.

During the era where they hosted user generated content, Spike.com&#x27;s managers only approved videos pre-screened to meet their standards. On January 18, 2018, Spike.com was sunsetted, and viewers were redirected to the new Paramount Network site and domain.

== International availability ==
=== Canada ===
In April 1984, while as TNN, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the channel for carriage by Canadian cable and satellite television providers. Following its re-branding as Spike TV, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters filed a complaint with the CRTC on behalf of Canwest Global, demanding the channel be removed from Canadian television providers. The CAB felt that its new general entertainment format would unduly compete with various Canadian-run specialty channels, arguing that there was overlap in its niche and its then-current schedule with Men TV (men&#x27;s lifestyle), Space (&quot;Star Trek&quot;), sports channels such as TheScore (WWE), Discovery Health (interstitial segments focusing on men&#x27;s health, although the network did not air any full-length programs on the topic and mainly focused on generic women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s health and pregnancy-related programming at the time), along with the inexplicable naming of Report on Business Television and CTV Travel for reasons unknown.

In January 2005, the CRTC dismissed the CAB&#x27;s complaint, ruling that it provided insufficient evidence that Spike was directly competing with Canadian specialty channels. The CRTC ruled that Spike did not unduly compete with Men TV, since it was licensed as a service that would carry men&#x27;s lifestyle programming (in contrast to Spike, which the CRTC classified as a general entertainment channel targeting males), and that the remaining allegations of overlap with domestic Canadian specialty channels represented only a minority of Spike&#x27;s overall programming.

Due to programming rights issues, programs which the channel does not hold rights to air outside of the U.S. are replaced with alternate programs, consisting mainly of reruns of Spike&#x27;s previous reality programs. 

In 2022, with Paramount Global prioritizing promotion of the Paramount+ streaming service in the market instead, a number of major providers began dropping the channel, beginning with Rogers Communications on April 1, 2022, followed by Shaw Cable and Shaw Direct on August 31, 2023, and Eastlink on September 15, 2023. The Canadian feed was discontinued on all other providers on January 1, 2024.

The airport has not had scheduled passenger service since June 8, 2010, when United Express (operated via a code sharing agreement with United Airlines by SkyWest Airlines) ended flights to Los Angeles International Airport. America West Express also served the airport with nonstop flights to Phoenix in the early-2000s via a code sharing agreement with America West Airlines.

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 15,961 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 12,060 in 2009 and 4,074 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport based on enplanements in 2008 (over 10,000 per year). By the time of the next NPIAS report, for 2015–2019, Oxnard Airport had been downgraded to a regional general aviation airport with only 19 enplanements.

== History ==
Ventura County opened Oxnard Airport in 1934 by clearing a 3,500 ft dirt runway. In the 1930s aviator Howard Hughes erected a tent at the airport to shelter his famous H-1 monoplane racer, which he tested from the dirt strip. In 1938 Ventura County paved the dirt runway and built a large hangar. In 1939 James McLean opened the Oxnard Flying School with a Piper J-3 Cub and a Kinner 2-seat airplane. Housing was built nearby for instructors and students at the school.

In late 1941, the airport was assigned to the U.S. Navy until the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu could be completed. The Navy moved to NAS Point Mugu in 1945 and the Oxnard Flying School returned to the airport. Ventura County regained control of the airport in 1948, receiving a final quitclaim deed. The state of California issued the airport an operating permit in 1949.

== Past airline service ==

Scheduled airline service started in 1946 with Southwest Airways flying Douglas DC-3s on a multi-stop route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Southwest then changed its name to Pacific Air Lines which in turn began operating Martin 4-0-4 prop aircraft followed by Fairchild F-27 turboprops into the airport. In 1968 Pacific merged with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which was subsequently renamed Hughes Airwest which in turn continued to serve Oxnard with F-27s. Also in 1968, Cable Commuter Airlines was operating de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter service to LAX. 
Hughes Airwest ended all service to Oxnard in the early 1970s and was then replaced by Golden West Airlines and other commuter air carriers. Golden West operated de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Short 330 turboprops nonstop to Los Angeles (LAX), San Diego and Santa Barbara. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in the fall of 1979 Golden West was operating shuttle service from LAX to the airport with 15 nonstop flights operated every weekday with Twin Otter commuter turboprops. Other service included Wings West with Beech 99 turboprops to Los Angeles and Desert Pacific Airlines flying Piper twin prop aircraft nonstop to San Francisco, Sacramento and Las Vegas. By 1980, Golden Gate Airlines was operating nonstop service to Bakersfield, Las Vegas, Monterey, and Santa Barbara with direct service to San Francisco. Also in 1980, Santa Barbara-based Apollo Airways was operating nine nonstop flights every weekday with Handley Page Jetstream commuter propjets from Santa Barbara (SBA) with direct connecting service from Bakersfield (BFL), Fresno (FAT), Las Vegas (LAS), Monterey (MRY), Oakland (OAK), Sacramento (SMF), San Francisco (SFO) and San Jose (SJC) via Santa Barbara. In 1981, two airlines were serving the airport according to the Official Airline Guide (OAG): Golden West Airlines with ten nonstop flights every weekday from Los Angeles (LAX) plus two nonstop flights every weekday from San Diego (SAN) primarily flown with Twin Otter aircraft with some flights being operated with the Short 330, and Apollo Airways operating Handley Page Jetstreams with five nonstop flights every weekday from Santa Barbara (SBA) with this Apollo service featuring connecting flights via Santa Barbara from the California cities of Bakersfield (BFL), Fresno (FAT), Monterey (MRY), Oakland (OAK), Sacramento (SMF), San Francisco (SFO) and San Jose (SJC).

Oxnard never received scheduled jet service; however, the airport did have Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia propjet service operated by WestAir as United Express nonstop to San Francisco (SFO) in the 1990s. By 2001, America West Express operated by Mesa Airlines via a code sharing agreement with America West Airlines was flying nonstop service to Phoenix (PHX) with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 propjets. Most service was operated to LAX with a few flights to Santa Barbara, Santa Maria and other cities at this time. In 1985, Evergreen Airspur, a division of Evergreen International Airlines, was operating de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters to LAX. In 1987 Resort Commuter Airlines was operating nonstop service to LAX as a Trans World Express air carrier on behalf of Trans World Airlines (TWA). By 1988 Qwest Air was flying nonstop service to San Diego (SAN) and Sacramento (SMF) with Dornier 228 commuter turboprops. Also during the late 1980s into the mid-1990s, two airlines were flying Oxnard-LAX service: American Eagle operated by Wings West flying Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner propjets and United Express operated by WestAir flying British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 propjets. The United Express service would later be taken over by SkyWest Airlines with this airline operating Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias. United Express subsequently ended all scheduled passenger flights at the airport and Oxnard no longer has passenger airline service but is served by two cargo airlines.

California Air Shuttle was a commuter airline based at the Oxnard Airport. In 1990, it briefly operated nonstop service with a Swearingen Metro II propjet aircraft between the airport and Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Jose and Sacramento. This new start-up air carrier quickly went out of business.

== Facilities and aircraft ==

Oxnard Airport covers 230 acres (93 ha) at an elevation of 45 feet (14 m) above mean sea level. Its one runway, 7/25, is 5,953 by 100 feet (1,814 x 30 m) asphalt. Fuel, parking and hangar space is available from private vendors at the airport.

In 2010 the airport had 55,323 aircraft operations, average 151 per day: 92% general aviation, 8% air taxi, and &lt;1% military. 157 aircraft were then based at this airport: 79% single-engine, 17% multi-engine, and 5% helicopter.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Cargo===
== Incidents ==
A single-engine Mooney M20C private plane crashed on July 10, 2022, into the airport fence along South Ventura Road during final approach while attempting to land. The pilot had minor injuries and the road was closed until the damaged plane could be removed. The fire department reported that the pilot got out of the aircraft on his own and that a fuel spill had occurred.

<text>The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side, a novel by Agatha Christie, was published in the UK in 1962 and a year later in the US under the title The Mirror Crack&#x27;d. The story features amateur detective Miss Marple solving a mystery in St Mary Mead.

==Plot summary==
Jane Marple falls while walking in St. Mary Mead. She is helped by Heather Badcock, who brings her into her own home to rest. Over tea, Heather tells Miss Marple how she met American actress Marina Gregg, who recently moved into the area and bought Gossington Hall from Miss Marple&#x27;s friend Dolly Bantry. 

Marina and her latest husband, film producer Jason Rudd, host a fête in honour of St John Ambulance. Guests include Mrs Bantry, actress Lola Brewster, Marina&#x27;s friend Ardwyck Fenn, and Heather with her husband Arthur. Heather corners Marina and launches into a long story about how they met years ago while Marina was visiting Bermuda, where Heather worked. Heather had been ill but was such a big fan of Marina that she left her sickbed to meet her favourite star and get her autograph. Mrs Bantry, standing nearby, notices a strange look cross Marina&#x27;s face during Heather&#x27;s monologue. A short while later, Heather collapses and dies.

When Mrs Bantry recounts the events to Miss Marple, she uses lines from the poem &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; (in which a curse falls upon the poem&#x27;s heroine) to describe the look she observed on Marina&#x27;s face. Detective Inspector Frank Cornish of the local police begins to investigate the case, learning that the drug had been in a daiquiri given to her by Marina after she spilt her drink. Cornish hands the case over to Chief Inspector Dermot Craddock of Scotland Yard when the latter is assigned to it in response to the county&#x27;s request for assistance.

Craddock delves into the complicated past of the presumed target, Marina. Desperate to have a child, she had adopted three before giving birth to a mentally disabled son and suffering a nervous breakdown. One of the adopted children, Margot Bence, was at Gossington Hall on the day of the fête. Despite bad feelings towards her adoptive mother, she denies putting the drug into Marina&#x27;s drink.

Two more people are killed during the investigation: Ella Zielinsky, Jason&#x27;s social secretary, dies after the atomizer she uses for her hay fever is poisoned with cyanide; and Giuseppe, Marina&#x27;s butler, is shot that night after spending the day in London and depositing £500 into his bank account. Ardwyck Fenn tells Craddock he received a phone call days before, accusing him of killing Heather, and that he recognized the anonymous caller as Zielinsky when she sneezed. Meanwhile, Jason suspects Marina is being targeted for death; she has been receiving several threatening notes, and a cup of coffee served to her proves to contain arsenic.

Miss Marple&#x27;s cleaner, Cherry Baker, tells Miss Marple that her friend Gladys Dixon, who was a server at Gossington Hall on the day of the fête, believes Marina deliberately spilled Heather&#x27;s drink and was going to meet Giuseppe before he died. After Gladys suddenly departs for a holiday in Bournemouth, Miss Marple travels to Gossington Hall to discover that Marina has died from an overdose.

Miss Marple talks to Jason and explains to him and DI Craddock how she has deduced that Marina must have been the murderer. Heather had been sick with German measles when she sought Marina&#x27;s autograph in Bermuda. Marina, in the early stages of pregnancy at the time, had contracted the disease, which led to her son being born disabled and her subsequent nervous breakdown. The look on Marina&#x27;s face, observed by Mrs Bantry at the fete, was triggered by Marina looking at a picture of a Madonna and Child on the wall behind Heather and finally realizing what had happened. Overcome with emotion, Marina put the Calmo in her own daiquiri, jolted Heather&#x27;s arm to make her spill her drink, and then gave Heather the drugged cocktail as a replacement. To cover her crime, Marina tried to convince everyone she had been the target of a murder attempt, writing the threatening notes herself and putting the arsenic into her coffee. She killed Ella and Giuseppe after they guessed her involvement and blackmailed her. Miss Marple had sent Gladys away to protect her from becoming Marina&#x27;s next victim.

Miss Marple implies that she believes Jason administered Marina&#x27;s overdose to prevent her from taking another life. He simply comments on his wife&#x27;s beauty and the suffering she endured.

==Literary significance and reception==
Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) was somewhat muted in his praise in his review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 7 December 1962 when he said, 
&quot;she has of course thought up one more brilliant little peg on which to hang her plot, but the chief interest to me of &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side&quot; was the shrewd exposition of what makes a female film star tick the way she does tick. And though one could accept a single coincidence concerning that married couple, the second and quite wildly improbable one tends to destroy faith in the story – still more so since it leads nowhere at all.&quot;

Maurice Richardson of &quot;The Observer&quot; of 11 November 1962 summed up, &quot;A moderate Christie; bit diffuse and not so taut as some; still fairly easy to read, though.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; gave a short review noting Miss Marple&#x27;s complaints about the limits imposed on her by getting old, yet nothing stops her mind from working well. The novel is summed up by this upbeat remark: &quot;It was her prying curiosity - her gift of putting odd bits together to form a picture that gave the locals and Scotland Yard the proper solution. Long life to her.&quot;

Robert Barnard, writing in 1990, said this novel was &quot;The last of the true English village mysteries in Christie&#x27;s output, and one of the best of her later books. Film milieu superimposed on the familiar St Mary Mead background.&quot; He went on to remark that &quot;Like most Marples this is not rich in clueing, but the changes in village life and class structure since the war are detailed in a knowledgeable and fairly sympathetic way.&quot;

The novel was on Anthony Boucher&#x27;s list for 1963 of Best Crime Fiction of the Year. It was one among 14 listed in 1963.

==The novel&#x27;s title==
The title comes from the poem &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. 
:Out flew the web and floated wide-
:The mirror crack&#x27;d from side to side;
:&quot;The curse is come upon me,&quot; cried 
:The Lady of Shalott.

==Developing the character of Marina Gregg==
&quot;Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology&quot; emphasized that &quot;Gregg&quot; is the surname of the ophthalmologist who first described cataracts in congenital rubella syndrome, Norman Gregg, and described this as &quot;one of [Christie&#x27;s] most subtle clues to identify the murderer&quot;.

The official site of the Agatha Christie estate suggests that, in writing Gregg, Christie was &quot;influenced&quot; by the life of American actress Gene Tierney.

Tierney contracted German measles while pregnant with her first child, during her only appearance at the Hollywood Canteen in June 1943. The baby developed congenital rubella syndrome and was born prematurely, underweight and needing a total blood transfusion. Doctors told the parents on the day of the birth that the premature birth and the child&#x27;s mental and physical disabilities were due to the mother contracting German measles in the first four months of the pregnancy; this was very hard news to absorb.

The deaf, partially blind and developmentally disabled child was later institutionalised in a psychiatric hospital. More than a year after that birth a woman asked Tierney for an autograph at a garden party. The woman said she had two years prior, while ill with German measles, skipped quarantine in order to visit the Hollywood Canteen and meet Tierney.

Tierney&#x27;s story was publicised before the novel was written. Tierney described the event in her autobiography 16 years after Christie wrote the novel.

==TV adaptations (by channel)==
===BBC===
A second adaptation of the novel was made by BBC television in 1992 as part of its series &quot;Miss Marple&quot; with the title role played by Joan Hickson (in her final performance as Jane Marple), and starring Claire Bloom as Marina Gregg and Glynis Barber as Lola Brewster. The only major changes are that Giuseppe is not killed, Arthur Badcock is not a former husband of Marina Gregg, Superintendent Slack and Sergeant Lake are written in, and the character of Hailey Preston is removed. The novel was the final adaptation for the BBC series &quot;Miss Marple&quot;. Margaret Courtenay appears in this adaptation as Miss Knight, having previously portrayed Dolly Bantry in the 1980 feature film version.

===ITV===
ITV Studios and WGBH Boston produced another adaptation in 2010 for the &quot;Marple&quot; television series, starring Julia McKenzie as Miss Marple, with Joanna Lumley reprising her role as Dolly Bantry, Lindsay Duncan as Marina Gregg and Hannah Waddingham as Lola Brewster. Investigating the murder along with Miss Marple is Inspector Hewitt, played by Hugh Bonneville. This version, while ultimately faithful to Christie&#x27;s original text, included a number of notable changes. Some of these changes were influenced by the changes that were made in the 1980 film adaptation:
* Ella&#x27;s surname is changed from Zielinsky to Blunt. The reason for her murder is changed, mixing in elements from the 1980 film and the motive for Giuseppe&#x27;s murder – Ella was attempting to blackmail the killer, but kept ringing the wrong people because she knew someone at the reception had done it, until she learned something that led her to phoning Marina and pointing out what she had done. Her love of Jason remains, but there is no affair.
* Giuseppe is omitted from the adaptation, and there is no reference to car-man Inch selling his business within it.
* Unlike the 1980 film adaptation, only one film is being shot in England, and that focuses on Nefertiti.
* Lola Brewster is married to one of Marina&#x27;s old husbands, Vincent Hogg (added in the adaptation). He is a journalist, who writes a couple of pieces regarding the murders and who does not have much love of Marina; she is an actress and had competed with Marina for the love of Jason, who married the latter, leaving Lola bitter about it. Both she and Vincent attend the reception and the filming of one of Marina&#x27;s scenes.

===France 2 ===
The novel was adapted as a 2017 episode of the French television series &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot;.

===TV Asahi===
TV Asahi adapted the novel in 2018 starring Ikki Sawamura and Hitomi Kuroki, with the title &quot;Two Nights Drama Special: Murder of the Great Actress – The Mirror Crack&#x27;d From Side to Side&quot; () as the second night, with the first night being &quot;4.50 from Paddington&quot;. This drama changed the main role to a chief inspector from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and merged Marple&#x27;s character into his.
* Cast:
** Ikki Sawamura – Chief Inspector Ryuya Shokokuji, based on Jane Marple and Dermot Craddock
** Yoshiyoshi Arakawa – Inspector Banpei Tatara
** Erena Mizusawa – Inspector Fueko Misaki
** Hitomi Kuroki – Madoka Irodori, based on Marina Gregg
** Ikko Furuya – Akira Kaido, based on Jason Rudd
** Naomi Zaizen – Sagiri Asakaze, based on Lola Brewster
** Masahiko Tsugawa – Hiraomi Danbara, based on Ardwyck Fenn
** Mari Nishio – Shimeko Akada, based on Ella Zielinsky
** Tomoharu Hasegawa – Toshiro Inden, based on Giuseppe
** Ryuji Katagiri – Kansuke Aramaki, based on Dr Gilchrist
** Kami Hiraiwa – Rin Kannokoji, based on Heather Badcock
** Takeo Nakahara – Koki Kannokoji, based on Arthur Badcock
** Haruna Kawaguchi – Kosame Taniguchi, based on Margot Bence
** Hayato Isomura – Matsubushi Matsuda, based on Margot Bence and Gladys Dixon
** Narumi Fukuda – Hinata Hanakage, also based on Margot Bence
** Zuimaru Awashima – Sosuke Aiba, based on Donald McNeil

===SBS TV===
The novel was also adapted as part of the Korean television series &quot;Ms. Ma, Nemesis&quot;.

==Adaptations to other media==

===English-language movie===
The novel was adapted for a 1980 feature film with Angela Lansbury in the role of Miss Marple. The film&#x27;s co-stars were Elizabeth Taylor as Marina and Kim Novak as Lola Brewster, and the cast also included Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis. The film was released as &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot;, the shortened US book title. The film changed a number of elements in the novel, including Marina&#x27;s surname (she uses Rudd, not Gregg), her associates, removing the character of Giuseppe, adding death threats, amongst other modifications—which include shifting the setting to 1953, nine years before the book&#x27;s publication.

===Bengali-language film===
Film director and screenwriter Rituparno Ghosh created a Bengali language version of Christie&#x27;s story as &quot;Shubho Mahurat&quot;, which reset the story in the film industry of Kolkata. In this version, Sharmila Tagore plays the ageing star Padmini, the counterpart to Christie&#x27;s Marina Gregg. The 2003 movie features Rakhee Gulzar in the role of the equivalent of Miss Marple.

===BBC radio adaptation===
A radio adaptation was made by the BBC in 1998. June Whitfield played Miss Marple, and Gayle Hunnicutt Marina Gregg, in a 90-minute version by Michael Bakewell.

===Stage===
It was adapted as a play by Rachel Wagstaff in 2019, premiering that year in a UK tour and revived for another UK tour in 2022. Margot is omitted, with Marina only adopting two children, who turn out to be Lola and Cherry, whilst Marple saves Zielinsky, who is in love with Marina. Neither Zielinsky nor Giuseppe blackmail Marina - instead Marina convinces him to cut the cable of a stage light to make it appear that someone is trying to murder her, but then shoots him dead for refusing her orders to kill Cherry, who saw both the cable cutting and Marina deliberately spilling Heather&#x27;s drink and told Zielensky, making her a murder target too.

<doc id="250491" wikidata="Q3536096" url="?curid=250491" title="Tree planting">
<text>Tree planting is the process of transplanting tree seedlings, generally for forestry, land reclamation, or landscaping purposes. It differs from the transplantation of larger trees in arboriculture and from the lower-cost but slower and less reliable distribution of tree seeds. Trees contribute to their environment over long periods of time by improving air quality, climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. During the process of photosynthesis, trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.

In silviculture, the activity is known as &quot;reforestation&quot;, or &quot;afforestation,&quot; depending on whether the area being planted has recently been forested or not. It involves planting seedlings over an area of land where the forest has been harvested or damaged by fire, disease, or human activity. Trees are planted in many different parts of the world, and strategies may differ widely across nations and regions and among individual reforestation companies. Tree planting is grounded in forest science and, if performed properly, can result in the successful regeneration of a deforested area. However a planted forest rarely replicates the biodiversity and complexity of a natural forest.

Because trees remove carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, tree planting can be used to help limit climate change. Desert greening projects are also motivated by improved biodiversity and reclamation of natural water systems, as well as improved economic and social welfare due to an increased number of jobs in farming and forestry.

== Types of trees planted ==

The type of tree planted may have great influence on the environmental outcomes. It is often much more profitable to outside interests to plant fast-growing species, such as eucalyptus, casuarina or pine (e.g., &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; or &quot;Pinus caribaea&quot;), even though the environmental and biodiversity benefits of such monoculture plantations are not comparable to native forest, and such offset projects are frequently objects of controversy.

To promote the growth of native ecosystems, many environmentalists advocate only indigenous trees be planted. A practical solution is to plant tough, fast-growing native tree species which begin rebuilding the land. Planting non-invasive trees that assist in the natural return of indigenous species is called &quot;assisted natural regeneration.&quot; There are many such species that can be planted, of which about 12 are in widespread use in the US, such as &quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot;.
Alternatively, farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR), involves farmers preserving trees (not replanting), and is considered to be a more cost-effective method of reforestation than regular tree planting.

== Season of planting ==
===Bareroot stock===
The classical silvicultural literature unanimously advocates spring as the time to plant bareroot stock, with lifting and outplanting taking place while the trees are still apparently dormant. This view, in which spring planting is implicit, was epitomized by Toumey and Korstian (1942): &quot;Almost without exception the most favourable time for ... planting is 2 weeks or more before buds [of the planting stock] begin their growth&quot;. Soil moisture conditions are generally favourable at the time when the growing season is about to begin, while dormant stock is less subject to mechanical injury and physiological shock.

If the size of the planting program allows, there is little doubt that such scheduling would be advantageous in that it satisfies one, and commonly 2, of the factors essential for success: (1) the use of planting stock that is physiologically capable of responding to a growth environment at planting, and (2) planting when site factors favour tree survival and growth. The 3rd factor a good planting job, and although desirable in all plantings, is probably somewhat less critical in conventional spring plantings than at other times. If, however, a planting program cannot be completed in this way, there are other options: conventional fall planting with fresh-lifted stock; summer planting with fresh-lifted stock; and spring and summer planting with stored spring-lifted or fall-lifted stock.

===Conventional spring planting with fresh spring-lifted stock===
In the context of regeneration silviculture, &quot;spring&quot;, &quot;summer&quot;, etc. lack precise meaning. Typically, the spring planting season begins as soon as lifting becomes possible in the nursery, and ends with the completion of the program. At this time, planting stock is physiologically attuned to the oncoming growing season, and the outplant has the whole of that season in which to establish its root system before it is challenged by any frost heaving. In practice, ideals are seldom attained. That stock is normally dormant when spring-planted is a widespread fallacy. Active growth is commonly obvious at the time of planting, but in any case the metabolic activity increases in planting stock before the tops give visible expression to this. The difficulty of obtaining, in quantity, spring-lifted stock in dormant condition increases with increasing continentality of climate. In many areas, the period of springlike weather is unreliable and often short. As well, the soil moisture advantage claimed for spring planting is also insecurely founded. Soils that are sandy or gravelly, and shallow soils of any texture are highly dependent on current weather due to their limited available water capacities. Nor will a plentiful supply of soil moisture benefit an outplant whose roots are enveloped in anaerobic and/or cold soil, and mortality of trees outplanted into soil colder than about 6 °C may be excessive. 

The spruces may be planted not only throughout the spring planting period provided that the period of most active shoot elongation is avoided, but virtually throughout the whole growing season, with little loss of performance other than some reduction in increment. 

===Conventional fall planting with fresh-lifted stock===
The fall planting season is generally considered to begin when nursery stock has hardened off and soil moisture reserves have been replenished by autumnal rain. It then continues until the planting program has been completed or is terminated by freeze-up or heavy snow. The advantages of fall planting were once considered &quot;To outweigh those of spring so certainly&quot; that in the National Forests of the Lake States almost all planting was done in the fall, but in spite of some success, operational fall plantings in North America have tended to be less successful than operational spring plantings. On certain sites, a major disadvantage of fall planting is that the root systems of outplants have little time in which to become firmly anchored before being subjected to frost heaving. Such plants are also vulnerable to &quot;winter browning&quot;, which may occur in the fall soon after planting, especially among stock having high shoot:root ratios. Relationships between dormancy progression and physiological condition, including root-growth capacity, are much less clear in the spruces than in the pines, but certainly there is good evidence that, in the absence of frost heaving, plantings of spruces can be just as successful in fall as in spring.

===Summer planting with fresh-lifted stock===
Conceptually and logistically, the simplest way of extending the conventional planting season is to extend lifting and planting of fresh stock through summer until the planting program has been competed. Summer planting has also been successful in a number of research studies with white spruce, e.g., Crossley 1956; Ackerman and Johnson 1962; Decie 1962 cited by Revel and Coates 1976; Burgar and Lyon 1968; Mullin 1971, 1974; Revel and Coates 1976. Success depends on minimizing stresses to planting stock at all stages from lifting through planting and on planting when site conditions are conducive to survival and growth.

===Spring and summer planting with stored stock===
Refrigerated storage of planting stock has been developed largely with the aim of overcoming problems experienced in using flushed planting stock. Storage provides a means of holding stock for use when fresh stock is either unavailable or at a stage of development that renders it unsuitable for planting. It also offers possibilities of manipulating the physiological condition of the stock. However, there are problems associated with storage, e.g., mold, cold injury, desiccation, and depletion of food reserves. The rate of deterioration depends very much on the physiological condition of the planting stock at the time of lifting, as well as on the storage environment and duration of storage.

Mullin and Forcier (1976) and Mullin and Reffle (1980) examined the effects of spring-lifting date and planting date on several species, including 3+0 white spruce after frozen storage, with fresh-lifted controls planted on each planting date for comparison. In all plantings, the earliest (2 May) lifting gave highest average second-year survival in all species. In another study, Mullin (1978) found that outplantings of frozen-stored 3+0 white spruce were consistently successful to the end of July only with the earliest-lifted (25 April) stock. Sutton (1982) also used 3+0 white spruce in outplanting every 2 weeks from the end of June through the growing season in 3 successive years on a variety of sites in northern Ontario. Despite variation in planting stock, poor storage environments and adverse weather, 4th-year results showed a consistent pattern of reasonable survival and growth rates among trees planted through July, with a rapid decline in performance of trees planted thereafter. Overwinter storage of stock has also been employed. It has the advantage of lifting stock at the end of the growing season when physiological processes are invoking natural dormancy.

Natural refrigerated overwinter storage has been used in root cellars and snow caches. Using natural refrigeration in root cellar storage, Jorgensen and Stanek (1962) kept 3+0 and 2+2 white spruce in dormant condition for 6 months without apparent detriment to performance after outplanting. Moreover, the stock was highly resistant to spring frost damage. Natural cold storage for overwintering 3+0 and 2+2 white spruce was also used by Mullin (1966). Unlike Jorgensen and Stanek&#x27;s (1962) stock, which was raised 550 km to the south of where it was planted, Mullin&#x27;s stock was raised in a nursery at about the same latitude as the planting site; the stock experienced inside-bale temperatures down to -15 °C in mid-winter, but still showed first- and second-year survival rates of 85.9% and 65.9%, respectively, compared with 91.4% and 76.2%, respectively, for fresh-lifted stock. However, Mullin&#x27;s stored stock was much more damaged by spring frost than was fresh-lifted stock and it &quot;showed a reduction in vigour as measured in terms of survival, susceptibility to damage and growth&quot;.

== Role in climate change mitigation ==
==By country==
===Australia===
Australian forests have been heavily affected since European colonisation, and some attempts have been made to restore native habitats, both by government and individuals. Greening Australia is a national Non profit set up to run the &quot;National Tree Program&quot; initiated by the Federal Government in 1982.

There is a strong volunteer movement for conservation in Australia through Landcare and other networks. National Tree Day is organised annually by Planet Ark in the last week in July, encouraging the public to plant 1 million native trees per year. Growing trees for Timber industries is a long-term project. It may take many years for a tree to mature to an age and size that is appropriate for the Timber to be used by industry. Some trees are many hundreds of years old.

Many state governments run their own &quot;Million Tree&quot; programs each year to encourage community involvement.

Trees for Life (Brooklyn Park) is an excellent example of a community organisation having a sustainable impact.

===Bangladesh===
45,000 tree saplings will be planted on rural roads in Bangladesh. Legal agreements will ensure that 60% tree wealth created will belong to the poorest families (45 km × 15 = 675 families). Local government and PEP each receive 20% tree wealth. 45 poor rural women &amp; 3 local social workers will be employed for 3 years to nurture the young saplings, receiving a monthly salary. With only 8% of the desired 25% land under tree coverage, the project will improve environment.

===Canada===
Most tree planting in Canada is carried out by private reforestation companies. Tree-planting is typically piece work and tree prices can vary widely depending on the difficulty of the terrain and on the winning contract&#x27;s bid price. As a result, there is a saying among planters: &quot;There is no bad land, only bad contracts.&quot; 4 months of hard work can yield enough to live on for an entire year, but conditions are harsh.

Tree planting crews often do not permanently reside in the areas where they work, thus much planting is based out of motels or bush camps. Bush camp accommodations usually consist of a mess tent, cook shack, dry goods tent, first aid tent, freshly dug outhouses, and a shower tent or trailer. Planters are responsible for bringing either a tent or car to sleep in. A camp also contains camp cooks and support staff.

The average British Columbian planter plants 1,600 trees per day, but it is not uncommon for experienced planters to plant up to 4,000 trees per day while working in the interior.These numbers are higher in central and eastern Canada, where the terrain is generally faster, however the price per tree is slightly lower as a result. Average daily totals of 2,500 are common, with experienced planters planting upwards of 5,000 trees a day. Numbers as high as 7,500 a day have been recorded. 

Quite often, tree planting contractors will deduct some of the cost associated with the operation of the contract directly from the tree planter&#x27;s daily earned wages. These imposed fees typically vary from $10 to $30 per day, and are referred to as &quot;camp costs&quot;.

Once inflation is factored in, real tree planter earnings have declined for many years in Canada. This has adversely affected the sector&#x27;s ability to attract and retain workers. 

Based on statistics for British Columbia, the average tree planter: lifts a cumulative weight of over , bends more than 200 times per hour, drives the shovel into the ground more than 200 times per hour and travels over with a heavy load, every day of the entire season. The reforestation industry has an average annual injury rate of approximately 22 claims per 100 workers, per year. It is often difficult and sometimes dangerous.

===Germany===

Tree planting is widely practiced in Germany.

===United Kingdom===

Planting in the UK is commonly referred to as &quot;restocking&quot;, when it takes place on land that has recently been harvested. When occurring on previously unforested land it is known as &quot;new planting&quot;.Under the British system, in order to acquire the necessary permissions to clearcut, the landowner must agree a management plan with the Forestry Commission (the regulatory body for all things forestry) which must include proposals for the re-establishment of tree cover on the land. Planting contractors will be engaged by the landowner/management company, a contract drawn up and work will typically take place from November to April when most of the transplants are dormant.

Planting is part of the rotational nature of much British plantation forestry. Productive tree crops are planted and subsequently clearcut. Some form of soil cultivation may take place and the ground is then restocked. Where the production of timber is a management priority, a prescribed stocking density must be achieved. For coniferous species this will be a minimum of 2500 stems per hectare at year 5 (from planting). Planting at this density has been shown to favour the development of straighter knot-free logs.

Planters are normally paid under piece work terms and an experienced worker will plant around 1600 trees a day under most conditions.

===India===

Tree Plantation drives combat many environmental issues like deforestation, erosion of soil, desertification in semi-arid areas, global warming and hence enhancing the beauty and balance of the environment. Trees absorb harmful gases and emit oxygen resulting in an increase in oxygen supply.
On average, a single tree emits 260 pounds of oxygen annually. Similarly, a fully-grown tree is sufficient for 18 human beings in one acre of land in one year stressing the importance of tree plantation for mankind. Aniruddha&#x27;s Academy of Disaster Management in Mumbai, India carries out numerous projects to plant trees on a huge scale. The foundation trains volunteer on this subject at Govidyapeetham (Cattle Conservation Institute) in the city of Karjat in Maharashtra, India. The trained volunteers then plant saplings, trees in groups on available land. Local government authorities also provide vacant plots, land on highways sides and on the hills for tree plantation.
Ek Kadam Sansthan of Jaipur, India is involved in many plantation projects including &quot;one tree my duty to plant trees on the earth&quot;. The Ek Kadam plant trees and hand them over to the individual at the village, who meets beneficiary criteria like they are financially challenged, physically challenged etc. After handing over the process Sansthan pays them 100 INR per tree for watering and safety from grazing cattle. Hence by this process Ek Kadam sansthan want to ensure 100% survivability of planted trees. Many volunteers are added to this campaign. The trained volunteers help Ek Kadam Sansthan to plant saplings, and managing all processes. Ek Kadam Sansthan not taking any support from government agencies. The management committee is regularised and managed by retired bureaucrats to ensure transparency in funds and performance measures.

Ek Kadam Sansthan&#x27;s campaign &quot;One Tree My Duty&quot; is working with technology-enabled tree plantation work.

===Iran===
In early 2020s Iran had a program for planting trees.
===Israel===
: &quot;See: Jewish National Fund#Afforestation; List of forests in Israel.&quot;
Tree-planting is an ancient Jewish tradition. The Talmudic rabbi Yohanan ben Zakai used to say that if a person planting a tree heard that the Messiah had arrived, he should finish planting before going to greet him. Due to massive afforestation efforts, this fact echoed in diverse campaigns. Israeli forests are the product of a major afforestation campaign by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).

The largest planted forest in Israel is Yatir Forest, located on the southern slopes of Mount Hebron, on the edge of the Negev Desert. It covers an area of 30,000 dunams (30 square kilometers). It is named after the ancient Levite city within its territory, Yatir, as written in the Torah: &quot;And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs, and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs&quot; (Book of Joshua 21:13–14). In 2006, the JNF signed a 49-year lease agreement with the State of Israel which gives it control over 30,000 hectares of Negev land for the development of forests. Research on climate change is being carried out in Yatir Forest. Studies of the Weizmann Institute of Science, in collaboration with the Desert Research Institute at Sde Boker, have shown that the trees function as a trap for carbon in the air. Shade provided by trees planted in the desert also reduces evaporation of the sparse rainfall. Yatir Forest is a part of the NASA project FluxNet, a global network of micrometeorological tower sites used to measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere. The Arava Institute for Environmental Studies conducts research that focuses on crops such as dates and grapes grown in the vicinity of Yatir forest. The research is part of a project aimed at introducing new crops into arid and saline zones.

The JNF has been criticized for planting non-native pine trees which are unsuited to the climate, rather than local species such as olive trees. Others say that JNF deserves credit for this decision, and the forests would not have survived otherwise. According to JNF statistics, six out of every 10 saplings planted at a JNF site in Jerusalem do not survive, although the survival rate for planting sites outside Jerusalem is much higher – close to 95 percent.

===New Zealand===
Kaingaroa Forest in New Zealand is the second largest planted forest in the southern hemisphere after the Sabie/Graskop area in South Africa. It is one of the many plantation forests planted since European settlement. The Monterey Pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;) is commonly used for plantations since a fast-growing cultivar suitable for a wide range of conditions has been developed.

Government agencies, environmental organisations and private trusts carry out tree planting for conservation and climate change mitigation. While some work is carried out by private enterprise, there are also planting days organised for volunteers. Landcare Research use planted forests for their EBEX21 system for greenhouse gas emissions mitigations.

===South Africa===
South Africa&#x27;s forests have been a heavily depleted mostly due to agriculture, traditional farming and urbanisation in the coastal regions. Various organizations are working on increasing the forest cover in parts of the country. Currently there is less than 0.5% forest cover in South Africa. Wildlands Conservation Trust and Food &amp; Trees for Africa (FTFA) are some of the oldest NGOs working to plant trees throughout South Africa—both established in the early 1990s. Greenpop is a national Social Enterprise established in 2010 which focusses on tree planting in sustainable urban greening and forest restoration in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is a strong volunteer movement for conservation in South Africa. National Tree Day or Arbor Day is organised annually in September, and has gone on to become national Arbor Month.

The largest planted forest in the Southern Hemisphere is located in the Sabie/Graskop area in South Africa and covers approximately 6,000 km2.

===United States===
Hand planting is the most widely practiced planting method in the United States. Hand planting is possible on most terrain, in most soil conditions, and around obstacles. Equipment for hand planting is inexpensive, but hand planting is labor-intensive resulting in costs that are generally 20% to 50% greater than those of machine planting. Hand planting is an attractive option for landowners and conservation organizations planting small acreages; especially if volunteer labor is available. Seedling survival rates will vary based on planters&#x27; experience levels. In the U.S., common hand planting tools include dibbles, mattocks, augers, and hoedads that are paired with a hip or shoulder harness style planting bag.

Machine planting is another common planting method in the United States. Equipment and transportation costs are such that machine planting is generally used for larger acreages where reduced labor cost and high planting productivity are desired. Machine planting is generally restricted to reasonably level terrain with good soil and limited obstacles. While machine planting is most often associated with plantation silviculture in the Southeast and Upper Midwest, it has been used in ecological restoration. Machine planting was used for forest restoration on Alaska&#x27;s Kenai Peninsula following a large scale Spruce Bark Beetle outbreak in the 1990s. 

Trees for the Future and Plant With Purpose are non-profit organizations based in the U.S. that plant trees in developing countries to improve land management. Other organizations that plant trees in the United States include:
* American Forests
* Planting Shade: Student run non-profit based in Virginia Beach. Gives citizens the resources to plant trees in their own backyard and other residential areas.
* Arbor Day Foundation
* Nature Conservancy
* Plant-it 2020
* USDA Forest Service &quot;Plant-A-Tree&quot; program in which a person can donate to plant trees in the National Forests.
* Our City Forest
* TreeFolks empowers central Texans to build stronger communities through planting and caring for trees. Since 1989, TreeFolks has planted over 1.5 million trees in parks, neighborhoods, and natural areas throughout central Texas.

==History==
Trees have been selectively planted by mankind for thousands of years the world over to provide food, shelter, timber, and other tree products as well as for ornamental and ceremonial purposes. The first woody species planted was probably olive in southeast Europe in 4000BC. There are also many biblical references to tree planting, such as in the Old Testament record of Abraham planting a tamarisk to commemorate the treaty of Beersheba (Gen. 21:33).

The concept of planting multiple trees together on a large scale to replenish material supplies first developed in Europe during the Middle Ages, and gradually gave rise to forestry plantations. The earliest records of conifer plantations come from Nuremberg in 1368, although the planting of trees on a large scale may have taken place as early as the 13th century in this region to reafforest exploited areas.

As Neolithic humans assumed a more settled way of life, and with the technological development of agriculture and consequent growth of civilization, more trees would need to be felled and gathered as a source of timber and other forest products and to make way for cultivation of crops. Given the finiteness of tree products in the absence of sufficient replanting, it was realized that clearance of forest and woodland must be controlled, and forests had to be managed and conserved for the natural resources they provided as demand grew. In England for example, this is evident from early laws that were passed in 1457 to encourage tree planting. However, despite these laws, persistent destruction of woodlands since the Anglo-Saxon period had by the seventeenth century led to a so-called &quot;timber famine&quot;. Because of this shortfall, timber was at a premium and thus became very expensive, which was especially problematic for shipbuilding and naval enterprises. Following an appeal by the Navy Board to the Royal Society for a solution, one member of the Society, John Evelyn, wrote and published his seminal 1664 work &quot;Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber&quot;. This conveyed a successful plea for reafforestation by persuading landowners to plant millions of trees on their private estates to make good the severe shortage of timber and repair the &quot;wooden walls&quot; of England.

In the tropics, there is a long history of planting teak for timber, dating back to the 15th century in Java. The demand for sustainable teak for general construction and shipbuilding purposes intensified with the arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century and the Dutch in the 17th century. The teak growing industry thereafter became controlled and monopolized by the Dutch East India Company.

In North America, tree planting on the western prairies was practiced by immigrants from the east during the 19th century. This was to satisfy the demand for wood and other tree products as well as to establish shelterbelts for agriculture, since naturally growing trees were very scarce on the Great Plains.

<doc id="250493" wikidata="Q223416" url="?curid=250493" title="Orly Airport">
<text>Paris Orly Airport (, ) is one of two international airports serving Paris, France, the other one being Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG). It is located partially in Orly and partially in Villeneuve-le-Roi, south of Paris. It serves as a secondary hub for domestic and overseas territories flights of Air France and as the homebase for Transavia France. Flights operate to destinations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean, South America, and North America.

Before the opening of CDG in 1974, Orly was the main airport of Paris. Even with the shift of most international traffic to CDG, Orly remains the busiest French airport for domestic traffic and the second busiest French airport overall in passenger traffic, with 33,123,027 passengers in 2024.

==Location==
Orly Airport covers of land. The airport area, including terminals and runways, spans over two &quot;départements&quot; and seven &quot;communes&quot;:
* Essonne &quot;département&quot;: &quot;communes&quot; of Paray-Vieille-Poste (West Terminal and half of South Terminal), Wissous, Athis-Mons, Chilly-Mazarin, and Morangis;
* Val-de-Marne &quot;département&quot;: &quot;communes&quot; of Villeneuve-le-Roi and Orly (half of South Terminal).

Management of the airport, however, is solely under the authority of &quot;Aéroports de Paris&quot;, which also manages Charles de Gaulle Airport, Le Bourget Airport, and several smaller airports in the suburbs of Paris.

==History==
===First years===
Originally known as &quot;Villeneuve-Orly Airport&quot;, the facility was opened in the southern suburbs of Paris in 1932 as a secondary airport to Le Bourget. Before this two huge airship hangars had been built there by the engineer Eugène Freyssinet from 1923 on.

===World War II===
As a result of the Battle of France in 1940, Orly Airport was used by the occupying German Luftwaffe as a combat airfield, stationing various fighter and bomber units at the airport throughout the occupation. Consequently, Orly was repeatedly attacked by the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), destroying much of its infrastructure, and leaving its runways with numerous bomb craters to limit its usefulness to the Germans.

After the Battle of Normandy and the retreat of German forces from the Paris area in August 1944, Orly was partially repaired by USAAF combat engineers and was used by Ninth Air Force as tactical airfield A-47. The 50th Fighter Group flew P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bomber aircraft from the airport until September, then liaison squadrons used the airfield until October 1945.

===Post-war===
The USAAF diagram from March 1947 shows the 27/207 (degrees magnetic) runway (later 03R) with 81/261 runway (later 08L) crossing it at its north end. The November 1953 Aeradio diagram shows four concrete runways, all wide: 03L , 03R , 08L and 08R .

The American United States Army Air Forces 1408th Army Air Force Base Unit was the primary operator at Orly Field until March 1947 when control was returned to the French Government. (The United States Air Force leased a small portion of the Airport to support Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) at Rocquencourt). The Americans left in 1967 as a result of France&#x27;s withdrawal from NATO&#x27;s integrated military command, and all non-French NATO forces were asked to leave France.

In May 1958, Pan Am Douglas DC-7Cs flew to Los Angeles in 21 hours and 56 minutes; Trans World Airlines, Air France and Pan Am flew nonstop to New York in 14h10–15min. Air France flew to Tokyo in 31h5min via Anchorage or 44h45min on a seven-stop Lockheed Constellation (1049G model) via India. Air France&#x27;s ten flights a day to London were almost all Vickers Viscounts; the only other London flight was Alitalia&#x27;s daily Douglas DC-6B (BEA was at Le Bourget).

A development project voted in 2012 planned to merge the airport&#x27;s south and west terminals with the construction of an building to create one great terminal. On 14 April 2016, the Groupe ADP rolled out the &quot;Connect 2020&quot; corporate strategy and the commercial brand Paris Aéroport was applied to all Parisian airports, including the Orly airport.

On 7 November 2015, the failure of a two-decade-old Windows 3.1 system which was responsible for communicating visual range information in foggy weather to pilots caused a temporary cease of operations. Whether the failure was hardware- or software-based is not specified, though the highlighting of the operating system suggests a software failure.

As part of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on aviation, the airport was closed to all commercial traffic from 1 April 2020 to 25 June 2020. During this period, commercial traffic and flights were relocated to Charles de Gaulle Airport, while Orly was still used for State flights, emergency diversions, and medical evacuations.

Paris Aéroport reported in 2023 that a tree-planting project in the vicinity of the airport, along the route of the route nationale 7, was being undertaken. The scheme involved planting 900 tree species and 14,000 forest seedlings. Paris Aéroport anticipates capturing 329 tonnes of carbon per year through the planting.

In October 2023, it was announced that Air France will largely cease using Orly Airport by summer 2026, with only one public service obligation flight to Corsica to remain.

==Terminals==


===Terminals 1 and 2===
Known as the West Terminal until March 2019, these two terminals consist of two floors and a gate area of four &quot;fingers&quot; rather than a brick-style layout. The ground level 0 features the arrivals facilities including eight baggage reclaim belts as well as several service facilities and shops. The departures area is located on level 1 with more stores and restaurants located here. This central departures area is connected to three gate areas split between Orly 1 (A and B gates) and Orly 2 (C gates). 23 stands at this terminal are equipped with jet-bridges, with several of them also able to handle wide-body aircraft.

===Terminal 3===
Inaugurated in April 2019, Terminal 3 is a junction building between Terminals 1, 2 and 4. The terminal allows customers to travel between all areas of the airport under one roof. It includes around of duty-free shopping along with several restaurants and lounges. It houses gates D and E, with direct access to Orly 4 departure gates.

===Terminal 4===
Formerly known as the South Terminal this innovative 1961 steel-and-glass terminal building consists of six floors. While the smaller basement level −1 as well as the upper levels 2, 3 and 4 contain only some service facilities, restaurants and office space, level 0 features the arrivals facilities as well as several shops and service counters. The airside area and departure gates are located on the upper level 1. The waiting area, which features several shops as well, houses gates E and F. 15 of the terminal&#x27;s departure gates are equipped with jet-bridges, some of which are able to handle wide-body aircraft.
==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Orly Airport:

*On 21 January 1957, a SNCASE Armagnac crashed attempting to land at night with instrument landing system monitored by GCA. One crewmember and one passenger out of the 70 on board died.
*On 19 May 1960, an Air Algérie Sud Aviation Caravelle collided with a Stampe SV.4 biplane on final approach about 8 miles SE of Orly. Despite suffering substantial damage, the Caravelle landed safely at Orly with no fatalities but the Stampe biplane crashed, killing the pilot.
* On 3 June 1962, Air France Flight 007, a chartered Boeing 707 named the &quot;Chateau de Sully&quot; bound for Atlanta, US, crashed on take-off with 132 people on board; 130 of them were killed.

<text>Electric Tepee is the seventeenth studio album by the English space rock group Hawkwind, released in 1992. It spent one week on the UK albums chart at #53.

After a European tour in March and April 1991, long-standing bass guitarist and keyboardist Harvey Bainbridge chose to leave the group. Vocalist Bridget Wishart would also end her association with the group in September. The group would go on to operate as a three piece of guitarist Dave Brock, bassist Alan Davey and drummer Richard Chadwick, making heavy use of sequencers, synthesisers and computers, both in the studio and live. The style of &quot;Electric Tepee&quot; is predominantly space rock, with elements of trance, ambient and techno.

The album was recorded in 1992 at Brock&#x27;s own Earth Studios, produced with Paul Cobbold. &quot;Mask of the Morning&quot; re-uses the lyrics from &quot;Mirror of Illusion&quot; from the 1970 debut album &quot;Hawkwind&quot;. &quot;Death of War&quot; uses lyrics written by Mark Rowntree, credited as &quot;Rown Tree&quot;, a convicted killer who has been held in a secure hospital since 1976. &quot;Rites of Netherworld&quot; is a brief keyboard piece based on Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. The instrumental track &quot;Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; includes samples of dialogue from &quot;Star Trek the Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Star Trek the Next Generation&quot; (specifically the episode &quot; The Offspring&quot;).

The cover is the first by Alan Arthurs, who was part of the band&#x27;s crew and also worked on Brock&#x27;s Devon farm. The album came in a gatefold sleeve with a painting of Castlerigg stone circle in the fold-out. It was the group&#x27;s first of two for Essential Records, a subsidiary of Castle Communications.

The group undertook a 23 date UK tour in April and May to promote the album, appearing behind a curtain on which the lightshow was projected. An all-nighter at the Brixton Academy on 15 August, when they were joined on-stage by Salt Tank, was released as &quot;Brixton Academy 15.8.92&quot;, using an amateur video shoot of the event.

<doc id="250497" wikidata="Q314135" url="?curid=250497" title="Charles-Pierre Augereau">
<text>Charles Pierre François Augereau, duc de [[Castiglione delle Stiviere|Castiglione]] (; 21 October 1757 – 12 June 1816) was a French military commander and a Marshal of the Empire who served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. After serving in the Revolutionary Wars, he earned rapid promotion while fighting against Spain and soon found himself as a division commander under Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy. He fought in all of Bonaparte&#x27;s battles of 1796 with great distinction. During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon entrusted Augereau with important commands. His life ended under a cloud because of his poor timing in switching sides between Napoleon and Louis XVIII. Napoleon wrote of Augereau that he &quot;has plenty of character, courage, firmness, activity; is inured to war; is well liked by the soldiery; is fortunate in his operations&quot;. Augereau is generally counted as one of the most capable generals of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Early years==
Augereau was born in Faubourg Saint-Marceau, Paris, as the son of a Parisian fruit seller (in some accounts, a servant). He enlisted in the army at the age of seventeen in the &quot;Clare&quot; Infantry Regiment, but was soon discharged. Later, he joined the dragoons. He became a noted swordsman and duellist, but he had to flee France after killing an officer in a quarrel. For the next 13 years Augereau drifted across Europe. He claimed to have served in the Russian Army against the Ottoman Empire, being present at the Siege of Izmail as a sergeant before deserting afterwards. He later enlisted in the infantry regiment of Prince Henry of Prussia and claimed he served in the Prussian Foot Guards as well. He deserted by masterminding a mass escape and reached Saxony, where he taught fencing.

In 1781, King Louis XVI proclaimed an amnesty for deserters, so Augereau returned to his native land. He joined the cavalry in 1784, and after serving in the carabiniers he was sent to the Kingdom of Naples as part of a military mission. While in Naples, he eloped with Gabrielle Grach and the two lovers traveled to Portugal where they spent the years 1788–1791. After the French Revolution broke out, the Portuguese jailed Augereau as a dangerous foreigner. Somehow, Gabrielle persuaded the authorities to release her husband and the couple returned to France. In September 1792, Augereau joined a volunteer cavalry unit, the &quot;German Legion&quot;, but this is without proof as Augereau claims that the papers were taken away from him during the Portuguese Inquisition.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Augereau&#x27;s unit was sent to put down the revolt in the Vendée in April 1793. The &quot;German Legion&quot; proved useless in battle because many of the soldiers switched sides, and the officers, including Augereau and François Marceau, found themselves in prison. Released, he served briefly in the 11th Hussars before serving as wagonmaster and as aide de camp to General Jean Antoine Rossignol. He was then assigned to train recruits for General Jean-Antoine Marbot at Toulouse. Marbot liked his work and Augereau soon became a close friend of the Marbot family.

It is not clear when, or if, Augereau was promoted to general of brigade, but he transferred to the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees and was promoted to general of division on 23 December 1793. When General Jacques François Dugommier became commander in January 1794, the army was thoroughly reorganized. Augereau became a divisional commander and played a significant role at the Battle of Boulou from 29 April to 1 May, where his feint attacks lured the Spanish Army led by General Luis Firmín de la Unión into a false position. After the victory at Boulou, the army advanced a short distance into Spain, with Augereau holding the right wing. At the Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga on 13 August, he skillfully repelled the assaults of 20,000 Spanish troops with his 10,000 French troops. On 17 November, Dugommier launched a major offensive against the Spanish at the Battle of the Black Mountain. On the first day, Augereau&#x27;s attack crushed the Spanish left flank while other French attacks proved unsuccessful. Dugommier was killed on the second day, but after a day&#x27;s pause, the advance resumed and the Spanish were routed.

After the Peace of Basel ended the War of the Pyrenees in July 1795, Augereau and his division were transferred to the Army of Italy. On 23 November 1795, Augereau fought at the Battle of Loano against the Austrians and Piedmontese. During the fighting, his troops attacked on the right near the coast, while General André Masséna&#x27;s division pierced the Allied center. The following April, his close association with Napoleon Bonaparte began when Bonaparte took command of the army and launched the Montenotte campaign. Augereau fought at the Battle of Millesimo on 13 April 1796, and accepted the surrender of the castle of Cosseria the next morning. He led his troops at the Battle of Ceva on the 16th, before serving in the Lodi campaign in early May and at the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May.

But it was at the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August 1796 that Augereau rendered the most notable services. In his memoirs, General Marcellin Marbot described Augereau as encouraging even Bonaparte himself in the confused situation that prevailed before that battle, though Marbot may not be the most reliable source, as he had not witnessed these events directly and because of his outspoken sympathy for Augereau. In any case, it was Bonaparte&#x27;s undoubted superiority as a strategist that made the victory at Castiglione a possibility. On 3 August, while Bonaparte defeated the Austrian corps of General Peter Quasdanovich, Augereau held off the main Austrian army of General Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. With 11,000 men, he attacked General Anton Lipthay&#x27;s brigade and drove it back on the Austrian main body. By the end of the day, Augereau faced 20,000 Austrians. The battle cost the Austrians about 1,000 casualties, while French losses were also heavy, including General Martial Beyrand who was killed. Augereau&#x27;s bold front allowed Bonaparte to dispose of Quasdanovich, then mass his main strength to beat Wurmser at Castiglione two days later.

Shortly after Castiglione, Bonaparte tersely summed up Augereau&#x27;s military qualities: &quot;Much character, courage, steadiness, activity; is used to war, liked by the soldiers, lucky in his operations.&quot;

In 1797, Bonaparte sent Augereau to Paris to encourage the Jacobin Directors. Augereau and the troops led by him coerced the &quot;moderates&quot; in the councils and carried through the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797). He was then sent to command French forces in Germany.

Augereau took little part in the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Brumaire in November 1799, and did not distinguish himself in the Rhenish campaign which followed. Nevertheless, owing to his final adhesion to Bonaparte&#x27;s fortunes, Augereau received a Marshal&#x27;s baton at the beginning of the First French Empire on 19 May 1804.

==Napoleonic Wars==

Augereau commanded a camp in Brest, Brittany, during preparations for the invasion of Britain. When Napoleon called off the invasion because of the growing threat from Austria and Russia, the camp became the VII Corps of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. With this force, Augereau fought in the War of the Third Coalition. His corps was charged with protecting the army&#x27;s lines of communications during the Ulm campaign. He fought in the battles of Konstanz and Bregenz, before tracking down and destroying General Franz Jellacic&#x27;s Austrian division at Dornbirn in Vorarlberg on 13 November 1805. This was followed by the occupation of Frankfurt am Main. His wife Gabrielle died while he was away.

During the War of the Fourth Coalition, Augereau was again commander of the VII Corps. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Jena on 14 October 1806 where his corps made up the left flank. Early in 1807, he fell ill with fever, and at the Battle of Eylau on 7 February 1807, he had to be supported on his horse. Nevertheless, he directed the movements of his corps with his usual bravery. Augereau&#x27;s corps was almost annihilated and the marshal himself received a wound in the arm from grapeshot.

Augereau became Duke of Castiglione on 19 March 1808, a hereditary victory title (i.e. not in chief of an actual fief, but a hollow title), in honour of the 1796 victory. In 1809, he married the 19-year-old Adélaïde Josephine Bourlon de Chavange (1789 – 1869) whom he had become infatuated with. Adélaïde, the daughter of Gilles Bernard Bourlon de Chavange and wife Jeanne Françoise Launuy, had no children with Augereau and the ducal title became extinct upon his death. His wife later remarried Camille de Sainte-Aldegonde (1787 – 1853), by whom she had a daughter Valentine de Sainte-Aldegonde (1820 – 1891), who married the 3rd Duke of Dino.
While serving in Catalonia during the Peninsular War from February to May 1810, Augereau gained some successes but tarnished his name with cruelty. It was Augereau&#x27;s brother Jean-Pierre, serving under Louis Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers, who was taken prisoner by the Russian vanguard near Smolensk. He sat out the German campaign in spring 1813 due to illness. Before the Battle of Leipzig in October, Napoleon reproached him with not being the Augereau of Castiglione; to which he replied, &quot;Give me back the old soldiers of Italy, and I will show you that I am.&quot; Yet, he led the IX Corps at Leipzig with skill and brought off his command in good order.

In 1814, Augereau was given command of the army of Lyon, and his slackness exposed him to the charge of having come to an understanding with the Allies. Thereafter, he served the restored Bourbon King Louis XVIII. But, after reviling Napoleon, he went over to him during the Hundred Days. The emperor repulsed Augereau and charged him with being a traitor to France in 1814.

After being re-restored to the throne in 1815 following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, King Louis XVIII deprived Augereau of his military title and pension. Augereau died at his estate of La Houssaye only a year later. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

<text>Rockhampton is a city in the Rockhampton Region of Central Queensland, Australia. In the , the population of Rockhampton was 79,293. A common nickname for Rockhampton is &#x27;Rocky&#x27;, and the demonym of Rockhampton is Rockhamptonite.

The Scottish-Norwegian explorers Charles and William Archer came across the Toonooba River in 1853 and named it in-honour of Sir Charles FitzRoy; they also named many local landmarks after figures in Norse mythology, including the Berserker Range named after the Norse warrior &quot;Baresark&quot;. The Archer brothers took-up a run near Gracemere in 1855, and more settlers arrived soon thereafter, enticed by the fertile valleys. The town of Rockhampton was proclaimed in 1858, and surveyed to a design that closely resembled the Hoddle Grid of Melbourne, and consisted of a grid of wide boulevards and laneways, which was uncommon for Queensland cities. Within a year, gold was found at Canoona, and led to the first North Australian gold rush. The Canoona gold rush led to an influx of migrants that transformed Rockhampton into the second-largest port in the state; during this period, Rockhampton became infamous for crime and violence, and was described by the then visiting English novelist, Anthony Trollope as the &quot;City of the Three S&#x27;s&quot;—&quot;sin, sweat, and sorrow&quot;. Subsequent gold discoveries at the Mount Morgan Mine, which was at that time one of the most-productive gold mines in the world, laid the foundations for much of the city&#x27;s Victorian architecture, and recast Rockhampton into a grand northern city.

The economy of Rockhampton has strengths in tourism, health, and agriculture, with a GRP of $5.7 billion as of 2023. The Central Queensland University founded in 1967, has its main campus at Norman Gardens, and is the only Australian university with a campus presence in every mainland state. The city is served by Rockhampton Airport, and Port Alma, located at the south end of the Fitzroy river delta.

Rockhampton is renowned for its architecture, cuisine, and music; in particular for its jazz scene, and has been sometimes referred to as the &quot;Melbourne of the North&quot;; in reference to the city&#x27;s tree-lined boulevards and laneways. The city&#x27;s historic quarter is one of Australia&#x27;s most significant 19th century streetscapes and is listed on the National Trust; the quarter comprises three city blocks along Quay street, from Fitzroy to Derby street, and is known for its neoclassical architecture, dining and nightlife. Some of the historical sites and landmarks of the city include; St Aubins, Kenmore House, the Alexandra Railway Bridge, St Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral and the nearby Central Park. The Rockhampton Botanic Gardens are one of the oldest public gardens in the country, being founded in 1869 and is also the location of the Rockhampton War Memorial, as well as the Rockhampton Zoo. Rockhampton has nationally prominent cultural institutions, including; the Rockhampton Museum of Art (RMOA), one of the most extensive regional galleries in Australia, and the Dreamtime Cultural Centre.

== History ==
=== Indigenous Australians ===
The Capricorn district is the traditional home of the Darumbal Aboriginal people. The Darumbal (Tarumbul, Tharoombool) language region includes the city of Rockhampton extending south towards Raglan Creek and north towards the Styx River and inland along the Broad Sound Ranges. The Gangulu (Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu) language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River, and includes parts of Rockhampton and South Rockhampton.

=== British colonisation ===
The British colonisation of the area began in 1853, when the Archer brothers, Charles and William, who were seeking grazing lands arrived in the Rockhampton area. They were acting on information from earlier expeditions by Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell, who had explored the area in 1844 and 1846 and noted suitable land for grazing then.
In January 1854, the New South Wales government proclaimed two new districts: Port Curtis and Leichhardt (roughly today&#x27;s Fitzroy Region), and the Archer brothers returned in August 1855 to set up their pastoral run at Gracemere. The Fitzroy River provided a convenient waterway for shipping of supplies and produce, and the Archer brothers constructed a wool shed just downstream of a bar of rocks that prevented further upstream navigation from the coast. These rocks were incorporated with the traditional English term for a village, and the name &quot;Rockhampton&quot; was first coined by Charles Archer and the local Commissioner from Crown Lands, William Wiseman.

In 1855, Scottish colonists and brothers William Thomas Elliott and George Mackenzie Elliot arrived at Gracemere and soon after, took up landholdings at Canoona, north of present-day Yaamba. Their father was James Elliot, 3rd Laird of Wolfelee House near Hawick in Scotland. One of their other brothers was Walter Elliot of the East India Company and secretary to the governor of the Madras Presidency.

In January 1856, after a massacre of local Aboriginal people perpetrated by Lieutenant John Murray of the Native Police at nearby Nankin Creek, some 200 Aboriginal men, women and children came to Canoona and began shouting at the employees of the Elliots. William Thomas Elliot and his men opened fire at random upon the group which fled after a short time. William and an employee were wounded (the employee reportedly died) and about seven of the local inhabitants were killed. Fellow colonist, Charles Archer of Gracemere and a group of Native Police troopers later pursued these Aboriginal people toward the east and punished them further. Local Aboriginal people friendly to Archer were also fired upon, killing one.

Permanent British settlement at the Rockhampton township began in July 1856, when Richard Palmer travelled from Gladstone with an escort of Native Police under sub-Lieutenant Walter Powell to set up a store. Powell arrived at the site first and constructed the Native Police barracks. This was the first habitable British building established at Rockhampton and it was located on the south bank of the Fitzroy River at the end of Albert Street.

With abundant grazing lands and waters from the Fitzroy River and its many tributaries and lagoons, the region continued to expand rapidly. In 1858, the town of Rockhampton was officially proclaimed. The town was surveyed at this time and the first sales of building allotments were held that year. In 1859, gold was discovered at Canoona. Miners rushed to the new field, using the site of Rockhampton on the Fitzroy River as the nearest navigable port. The Canoona field proved to be very disappointing and thousands of would-be gold seekers were left stranded at Rockhampton. Although many returned south, others stayed, adding to the new town&#x27;s population.

Conflict with Aboriginal people in the region continued and further massacres occurred. In 1859, John Arthur Macartney attempted to stock his cousin&#x27;s Belmont property just to the north of Rockhampton when a shepherd was killed by local Aboriginal men. 2nd Lieutenant Frederick Carr of the Native Police together with his troopers, the Macartneys, Peter Fitzallan MacDonald and Henry Brisdon, formed an armed group which set out to track down those responsible. The group followed the tracks and &quot;dispersed&quot; them. One account of this incident describes how around hundred of the tribe were rounded up and &quot;it ended in the usual way and the bulk of the wild mob were shot.&quot;

By 1861, the town boasted a regular newspaper, banks, court house, and school of arts. Direct shipments of imported goods and migrants from the United Kingdom began to be received during the 1860s. In 1862, land in the Kensington Estate, described as just three miles from &quot;the most rapidly rising town and district in the whole of the colonies&quot; was advertised for sale. During the 1860s and &#x27;70s, Rockhampton developed as the main port for the developing Central Queensland hinterland, the main export at that time being wool.

A Primitive Methodist Church opened in Fitzroy Street, Rockhampton, in January 1864.

=== Gold rushes and expansion ===

In the 1880s and &#x27;90s, sea ports were established on the coast, adjacent to the mouth of the Fitzroy River. Broadmount was on the northern side and Port Alma on the south. Railways were subsequently constructed to carry goods to the wharves at these locations, with the railway to Broadmount opening on 1 January 1898 and the line to Port Alma opening on 16 October 1911. Maintenance on the Broadmount line ceased in August 1929. The following month, the wharf caught fire and the line was effectively closed in July 1930. The line to Port Alma closed on 15 October 1986.

The significant gold deposit at Mount Morgan to the southwest was discovered in the 1880s, and Rockhampton became the main port through which the wealth of Mount Morgan gold was channelled. Due to the wealth of Mount Morgan, Rockhampton weathered the severe economic depression of the 1890s, and many of the town&#x27;s substantial brick and stone public buildings date from this period. The historic streetscape of Quay Street still displays a number of substantial historic buildings, built when Rockhampton was envisaged as being capital of a state of North Queensland. Most prominent of these is the sandstone Customs House (1900), which today houses an information centre. Other important 19th-century buildings include the Post Office (1892), the Supreme Court House (1888), and St Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral (1892).

In September 1892 the Anglican Church in Rockhampton was the first new building in Rockhampton to be lit by electricity from the new gasworks. It was also the first church in Australia to be lit with electricity.

=== Central Queensland Separation Movement ===
In 1889 the people of Rockhampton established the Central Queensland Territorial Separation League, a secessionist movement with the intentions of breaking away from the state of Queensland. The core argument of movement was that the seat of government, Brisbane was in the south-east corner of the State. It was so far removed from substantial portions of the state that these areas and their citizens were left disadvantaged and neglected as political and economic interests focused on the south. Supplementing the Central Queensland Territorial Separation League, the women of Rockhampton established their own separation league in October 1892. The inaugural meeting of the Women&#x27;s Central Queensland Territorial Separation League was held at the Rockhampton School of Arts and attended by 200 women. Their main focus was preparing a petition to Queen Victoria.  The introductory text set out their grievances and described the immense size of Queensland: being twelve times the area of England and Wales, and larger than France, Germany, Spain and Portugal combined. The State Library of Queensland holds the original petition, signed by over 3000 women who were in support of Central Queensland becoming a separate state. The petition was forwarded to Queen Victoria but was dismissed by the Premier of Queensland, Sir Samuel Walker Griffith.

=== 20th century ===

The City of Rockhampton was proclaimed in 1902. The rail connection south to Brisbane was completed in 1903, but it was not until 1921 that the northern connection to Mackay was finally completed. A railway west from Rockhampton was started in 1867 and by 1892 had reached the terminus at Longreach, away. This further strengthened Rockhampton&#x27;s role as the port for the whole of Central Queensland.

A passenger tramway began operating on 16 June 1909, making Rockhampton the only provincial city in Queensland to have a street tramway. Purrey steam trams ran on a number of routes throughout South Rockhampton, totalling of track. The discomfort of passengers riding in steam trams in a tropical climate in part led to their demise in 1939, replaced by a bus network run by the City Council.

Strong shaking was felt in Rockhampton when the &quot;Great Queensland Earthquake of 1918&quot; occurred on 7 June 1918. The earthquake was felt from Mackay in the north, to Grafton in New South Wales, and west to Charleville. Estimated to have reached a 6.0 magnitude, the earthquake caused some damage to buildings including chimney stacks crumbling, plaster being dislodged from walls and ceilings, water tanks bursting and trees being uprooted.

== Geography ==

The town lies on the Fitzroy River, approximately from where the river enters the Coral Sea, and some north of the state capital, Brisbane. Rockhampton has a north and south side with three bridges connecting the two sides, one for trains and two for vehicles and people.

Rockhampton lies just north of the Tropic of Capricorn in Central Queensland. A sculpture originally marking the latitude was later moved into town to be more accessible to tourists. Although the Tropic of Capricorn is represented on maps as a &quot;dotted line&quot; that lies at 23° 26&#x27; 22&quot;, there is actually a bio-geographical overlap of Tropical and Temperate zones more than wide; Rockhampton is roughly at its centre on the East Coast of Australia.

The city is located on the banks of the Fitzroy River, approximately from the river mouth. The Berserker Range lies on the eastern side of the city, with the Athelstane Range to the west. The coastal area to the east of the city is known as the Capricorn Coast, with the rapidly growing town of Yeppoon its major centre.

=== Climate ===

== Governance ==

Rockhampton is governed by the Rockhampton Regional Council. The Council consists of a mayor and seven councillors. The Mayor is elected by the public, and the Councillors are elected from seven single-member divisions using an optional preferential voting system. Elections are held every four years.

Tony Williams is the current mayor after the 2021 mayoral by-election following the resignation of long time mayor Margaret Strelow. Margaret Strelow won the mayoral elections in 2013, 2016 and March 2020. Strelow had also served as Mayor of the former City of Rockhampton from 2000 to 2008.

The present Rockhampton Regional Council area was formed as a result of the 2008 amalgamation of four local government areas. These were the original City of Rockhampton which comprised most of the Rockhampton metropolitan area, the Shire of Fitzroy comprising Gracemere and surrounding districts, and the Shire of Mount Morgan around the town of Mount Morgan itself.

The fourth local government area was the Shire of Livingstone which comprised the adjacent coastal towns and hinterland to the east and north of Rockhampton as well as some outlying Rockhampton suburbs. However, Livingstone Shire de-amalgamated from Rockhampton Region in 2014 following a referendum.

Before the 2008 amalgamation, the City of Rockhampton had a population of approximately 74,530, Fitzroy Shire approximately 11,357, and Mount Morgan Shire approximately 2,925 people.

Proposed boundary changes between Rockhampton Regional Council and Livingstone Shire Council are under review by the Local Government Change Commission. The changes relate to three suburbs contiguous with Rockhampton City which are presently part of Livingstone Shire. The proposed changes will affect 1170 properties in the suburbs of Glenlee, Rockyview, and Glendale.

== Economy ==

===Agriculture===

The agricultural sector, specifically the cattle trade, is a dominant industry in Central Queensland. The latter has been visually represented around Rockhampton City with a
set of seven large statues of bulls known as the &#x27;Big Bulls&#x27;.

Two large abattoirs are located on the south-eastern outskirts of Rockhampton provides employment for people living in Rockhampton and also for refugees from overseas who are recruited when the companies experience difficulty finding local workers to fill vacancies.

One meat processing plant is located at Lakes Creek, operated by Teys Australia (a Cargill joint venture) while the JBS meatworks is located at Nerimbera.

The Teys Australia meatworks at Lakes Creek was previously owned by Kerry Packer&#x27;s Consolidated Meat Group. CMG temporarily closed the facility in 2002. It was reopened in 2004, when Consolidated Meat Group announced they had formed a joint venture with Teys Australia. In 2011, Cargill bought out CMG&#x27;s share in the company.

Due to drought, floods, general economic conditions and disputes with workers, both facilities have experienced a number of closures over the years including the closure of the Lakes Creek meatworks from 2002 until 2004, but they are both currently operating as normal.

The Central Queensland Livestock Exchange at Gracemere is one of the largest livestock sales facilities in the country, lies just to the west of the city.

Rockhampton promotes itself as the &quot;Beef Capital of Australia&quot; but the title has been disputed a number of times by the New South Wales town of Casino.

===Military===
There is a permanent military presence in Rockhampton with members of the Australian Defence Force based at the Western Street Army Barracks located near the Rockhampton Airport. To the north of the city lies the extensive Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area where large scale ground, air and amphibious operations are regularly conducted.

Due to its close proximity to the training area, the city regularly sees military movements between the Western Street Army Barracks and Shoalwater Bay, and hosts service personnel from overseas when joint military exercises are held. When these exercises occur, Rockhampton sees a noticeable increase in activity from military transport, including from defence aircraft that are frequently seen at Rockhampton Airport throughout the exercise periods.

The local economy is significantly boosted when visiting overseas troops stay in the city while participating in the army exercises.

Military training conducted in the Rockhampton area regularly draws the ire of nomadic peace activists who travel to the city to protest the exercises.

In 2011, during Exercise Talisman Sabre, a protester made his way onto the tarmac at Rockhampton Airport and attacked a $36 million Tiger helicopter with a garden mattock. The man was ordered to stand trial charged with wilful damage and threatening an aircraft but died before the matter went to trial.

===Tourism===
Tourism is increasingly playing a role in the economic development of city and surrounds. The city is a convenient distance north from Brisbane to provide an overnight stop for tourists, who can then branch out to visit local attractions and spend money at local businesses including eateries, entertainment facilities or on recreational activities. The Capricorn Coast is a 30-minute drive from Rockhampton, with the islands of the Keppel group easily accessible from there.

Other attractions that are promoted to the tourist market include the Fitzroy River, the Heritage-listed buildings in the CBD, the Rockhampton Heritage Village, the Dreamtime Cultural Centre, the Archer Park Rail Museum, Mount Archer National Park, Rockhampton Botanic Gardens, and Rockhampton Zoo.

The first known use of wireless in the Rockhampton vicinity was the wireless equipped (Marconi system) two destroyers (HMS Yarra and HMS Parramatta) of the Australia squadron of the Royal Navy when visiting Rockhampton in May 1911. The group was commanded by Lieutenant G. F. Hyde.

There were at least three licensed (and likely many unlicensed) early wireless experimenters at Rockhampton immediately prior to the outbreak of World War 1: L. Freeman (Callsign: XQB); Robert Henry Berry (Callsign: XQC); and H. A. Shepherd (Callsign: XQD). Operation was on longwave using spark transmission; there was no known use of telephony.

As part of the Australian Coastal Radio Network, station VIR Rockhampton commenced operation on 24 May 1913 from a transmitter site at The Range. The station provided service to coastal shipping in the region between VIB Brisbane and VIT Townsville. It operated on longwave and was a vital part of Australia&#x27;s defence during World War 1.

A B class licence was granted to the Queensland Government in April 1925 for a Rockhampton station to relay, via landline, its A class station 4QG Brisbane. It was proposed to operate on a wavelength of 323 metres (928.8 kHz) with a transmitter input power of 500 watts (corresponds to a transmitter power of about 150 watts). The station was never implemented.

The earliest known broadcasting service at Rockhampton was an amateur broadcasting station (Callsign: 4DO) operated by local theatre manager Harold Learmonth Hobler. He transmitted basic programmes in late 1924 on a frequency of 1250 kHz.
In August and September 1931, 4DO was again testing Sunday night transmissions on 1250 kHz &amp; 1200 kHz, perhaps with a view to a Class B licence for his employer Tivoli Talkies.

The first permanent Rockhampton broadcast station was 4RK which commenced operation on 29 July 1931.

=== Water ===
The catchment area of the Fitzroy River is approximately 145,000 square kilometres (almost the size of England).
It contains six major rivers, and Rockhampton and Central Queensland accordingly enjoy abundant good water. The existing and future dams under construction ensure on-going needs for agriculture, industry and domestic purposes are met.
The Fitzroy River Barrage at Rockhampton separates tidal salt water from upstream fresh water, and provides the supply for Rockhampton&#x27;s domestic and industrial needs.

=== Power ===
Central Queensland&#x27;s major generating facilities, including the Stanwell, Gladstone and Callide power stations, produce the majority of the State&#x27;s power. Queensland&#x27;s newest and most technologically advanced powerhouse at Stanwell, west of the city, came on line in 1993. The Stanwell facility is a key element in the State&#x27;s program to expand electricity supply and is a major exporter of power station technology.

<doc id="250505" wikidata="Q236950" url="?curid=250505" title="Erica Jong">
<text>Erica Jong (née Mann; born March 26, 1942) is an American novelist, satirist, and poet, known particularly for her 1973 novel &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;. The book became famously controversial for its attitudes towards female sexuality and figured prominently in the development of second-wave feminism. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, it has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, while by 2022, the &quot;New York Times&quot; claimed that it had sold more than 37 million copies worldwide.

== Early life and education ==
Jong was born on March 26, 1942. She is one of three daughters of Seymour Mann (died 2004), and Eda Mirsky (1911–2012). Her father was a businessman of Polish Jewish ancestry who owned a gifts and home accessories company known for its mass production of porcelain dolls. Her mother was born in England of a Russian Jewish immigrant family, and was a painter and textile designer who also designed dolls for her husband&#x27;s company.

Jong has an elder sister, Suzanna, who married Lebanese businessman Arthur Daou, and a younger sister, Claudia, a social worker who married Gideon S. Oberweger (the chief executive officer of Seymour Mann Inc. until his death in 2006). Among her nephews is Peter Daou, a political strategist and former musician who in 1994 produced an album titled &quot;Zipless&quot;, a concept album based on Jong&#x27;s novel &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;.

Jong attended New York&#x27;s The High School of Music &amp; Art in the 1950s, where she developed her passion for art and writing. As a student at Barnard College, Jong edited the &quot;Barnard Literary Magazine&quot; and created poetry programs for the Columbia University campus radio station, WKCR. In 1963, Jong graduated from Barnard College, and in 1965, with an MA in 18th century English Literature from Columbia University.

==Career==

Jong is best known for her first novel, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; (1973), which created a sensation with its frank treatment of a woman&#x27;s sexual desires, through an account of Isadora Wing, a woman in her late twenties, searching for who she is and where she is going. Jong employed psychological and humorous descriptive elements, rich cultural and literary references, frank depictions of and ruminations on sex.

The book addresses some of the conflicts that were arising for women in late 1960s - early 1970s America - - of womanhood, femininity, sex, and relationships, versus the quest for freedom and purpose. The saga of the thwarted fulfillment of Isadora Wing continues in two further novels, &quot;How to Save Your Own Life&quot; (1977) and &quot;Parachutes and Kisses&quot; (1984).

==Personal life==
Jong has been married four times. After a brief marriage to Michael Werthman while at Barnard, and another in 1966 to Allan Jong, a Chinese American psychiatrist, in 1977 she married Jonathan Fast, a novelist, social work educator, and son of novelist Howard Fast. This marriage was described in &quot;How to Save Your Own Life&quot; and &quot;Parachutes and Kisses&quot;. She has a daughter from her third marriage, Molly Jong-Fast. The first three marriages ended in divorce. Jong was married to Kenneth David Burrows, a New York litigator, until his death on December 14, 2023.

Jong lived on an army base in Heidelberg, West Germany, for three years (1966–69) with her second husband. She was a frequent visitor to Venice, and wrote about that city in her novel &quot;Shylock&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

In 2007, her literary archive was acquired by Columbia University in New York City.

Jong is mentioned in &quot;Highlands&quot;, the closing song of Bob Dylan&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning album &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; (1997), as a &quot;women author&quot; that the narrator reads. She is also satirized on the MC Paul Barman track &quot;N.O.W.&quot;, in which the rapper fantasizes about a young leftist carrying a fictitious Jong book titled &quot;America&#x27;s Wrong&quot;.

Jong supports LGBT rights and legalization of same-sex marriage: &quot;Gay marriage is a blessing not a curse. It certainly promotes stability and family. And it&#x27;s certainly good for kids.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Arsuf took place on 7 September 1191, as part of the Third Crusade. It saw a multi-national force of Crusaders, led by Richard I of England, defeat a significantly larger army of the Ayyubid Sultanate, led by Saladin.

Following the Crusaders&#x27; capture of Acre, Saladin moved to intercept Richard&#x27;s advancing army just outside of the city of Arsuf ( in Latin) as it moved along the coast from Acre towards Jaffa. In an attempt to disrupt the cohesion of the Crusader army as they mobilized, the Ayyubid force launched a series of harassing attacks that were ultimately unsuccessful at breaking their formation. As the Crusaders crossed the plain to the north of Arsuf, Saladin committed the whole of his army to a pitched battle. The Crusader army maintained a defensive formation as it marched, with Richard awaiting the ideal moment to mount a counterattack. However, after the Knights Hospitaller launched a charge at the Ayyubids, Richard was forced to commit his entire force to support the attack. The Crusader charge broke the Ayyubid army; Richard was able to restrain his cavalry from a rash pursuit, regrouping them to achieve victory.

Following the engagement, the Crusaders secured control over the central coast of Palestine, including the city of Jaffa.

==Prelude: south from Acre==
Following the capture of Acre in 1191, Richard was aware that he needed to capture the port of Jaffa, before making an attempt on Jerusalem. Richard began to march down the coast from Acre towards Jaffa in August. Saladin, whose main objective was to prevent the recapture of Jerusalem, mobilised his army to attempt to stop the Crusaders&#x27; advance. Richard organised the advance with attention to detail. A large part of the Egyptian fleet had been captured at the fall of Acre, and with no threat from this quarter he could march south along the coast with the sea always protecting his right flank. Saladin had destroyed (slighted) Jaffa&#x27;s fortifications in the summer of 1190 due to its potential importance to the Crusaders.

Mindful of the lessons of the disaster at Hattin, Richard knew that his army&#x27;s greatest need was water and that heat exhaustion was its greatest danger. Although pressed for time he proceeded at a relatively slow pace. He marched his army only in the morning before the heat of the day, making frequent rest stops, always beside sources of water. The fleet sailed down the coast in close support, a source of supplies and a refuge for the wounded. Aware of the ever-present danger of enemy raiders and the possibility of hit-and-run attacks, he kept the column in tight formation with a core of twelve mounted regiments, each with a hundred knights. The infantry marched on the landward flank, covering the flanks of the horsemen and affording them some protection from missiles. The outermost ranks of the infantry were composed of crossbowmen. On the seaward side was the baggage and also units of infantry being rested from the continuous harassment inflicted by Saladin&#x27;s forces. Richard wisely rotated his infantry units to keep them relatively fresh.

Though provoked and tormented by the skirmish tactics of Saladin&#x27;s archers, Richard&#x27;s generalship ensured that order and discipline were maintained under the most difficult of circumstances. Baha al-Din ibn Shaddad, the Muslim chronicler and eyewitness, describes the march:

&quot;The Moslems discharged arrows at them from all sides to annoy them, and force them to charge: but in this they were unsuccessful. These men exercised wonderful self-control; they went on their way without any hurry, whilst their ships followed their line of march along the coast, and in this manner they reached their halting-place.&quot;

Baha al-Din also described the difference in power between the Crusader crossbow and the bows of his own army. He saw Frankish infantrymen with from one to ten arrows sticking from their armoured backs marching along with no apparent hurt, whilst the crossbows struck down both horse and man amongst the Muslims.

==Saladin&#x27;s strategy==
The Crusader army&#x27;s pace was dictated by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, had the advantage of superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard&#x27;s army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin&#x27;s army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.

By early September, Saladin had realised that harassing the Frankish army with a limited portion of his troops was not going to stop its advance. In order to do this he needed to commit his entire army to a serious attack. Fortuitously for Saladin, the Crusaders had to traverse one of the few forested regions of Palestine, the &quot;Wood of Arsuf&quot;, which ran parallel to the sea shore for more than . The woodland would mask the disposition of his army and allow a sudden attack to be launched.

The Crusaders traversed half of the forest with little incident, and they rested on 6 September with their camp protected by the marsh lying inland of the mouth of the river Nahr-el-Falaik, called by them &quot;Rochetaillée&quot;. To the south of the camp, in the the Crusaders needed to march before gaining the ruins of Arsuf, the forest receded inland to create a narrow plain wide between wooded hills and the sea. This is where Saladin intended to make his decisive attack. While threatening and skirmishing along the whole length of the Crusader column, Saladin reserved his most sustained direct assault for its rear. His plan appears to have been to allow the Frankish van and centre to proceed, in the hope that a fatal gap might be created between them and the more heavily engaged rearmost units. Into such a gap Saladin would have thrown his reserves in order to defeat the Crusaders in detail.

==Battle==

=== Estimation of the size of the opposing armies ===
The &quot;Itinerarium Regis Ricardi&quot; implies that the Ayyubid army outnumbered the Crusaders three-to-one. However, unrealistically inflated numbers, of 300,000 and 100,000 respectively, are described. Modern estimates of Saladin&#x27;s army place it at around 25,000 soldiers, almost all cavalry (horse archers, light cavalry, and a minority of heavy cavalry). Based on the number of soldiers that the three kings brought to the Holy Land, as well as what troops the Kingdom of Jerusalem could muster, McLynn calculates the total Crusader forces at Arsuf as numbering 20,000: 9,000 troops brought by Richard from his dominions, 7,000 French troops left by Phillip, 2,000 troops from Outremer, and 2,000 more soldiers from every other source (Danes, Frisians, Genoese, Pisans, Turcopoles). Boas notes that this calculation doesn&#x27;t account for losses in earlier battles or desertions, but that it is probable that the Crusader army had 10,000 men and perhaps more. The &quot;Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare&quot; lists Richard&#x27;s army as possessing 10,000 infantry (including spearmen and crossbowmen) and 1,200 heavy cavalry, with Saladin&#x27;s army possessing twice as many men with a preponderance of cavalry.

===Organisation and deployment===

At dawn on 7 September, as Richard&#x27;s forces began moving out of camp enemy scouts were visible in all directions, hinting that Saladin&#x27;s whole army lay hidden in the woodland. King Richard took especial pains over the disposition of his army. The probable posts of greatest danger, at the front and especially the rear of the column, were given to the military orders. They had the most experience of fighting in the East, were arguably the most disciplined, and were the only formations which included Turcopole cavalry who fought like the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.

The vanguard of the Crusader army consisted of the Knights Templar under Robert de Sablé. They were followed by three units composed of Richard&#x27;s own subjects, the Angevins and Bretons, then the Poitevins including Guy of Lusignan, titular King of Jerusalem, and lastly the English and Normans who had charge of the great standard mounted on its waggon. The next seven corps were made up of the French, the Flemings, the barons of Outremer and small contingents of crusaders from other lands. Forming the rearguard were the Knights Hospitaller led by Garnier de Nablus. The twelve corps were organised into five larger formations, though their precise distribution is unknown. Additionally, a small troop, under the leadership of Henry II of Champagne, was detached to scout towards the hills, and a squadron of picked knights under King Richard and Hugh of Burgundy, the leader of the French contingent, was detailed to ride up and down the column checking on Saladin&#x27;s movements and ensuring that their own ranks were kept in order.

The first Saracen attack did not come until all the crusaders had left their camp and were moving towards Arsuf. The Ayyubid army then burst out of the woodland. The front of the army was composed of dense swarms of skirmishers, both horse and foot, Bedouin, Sudanese archers and the lighter types of Turkish horse archers. Behind these were the ordered squadrons of armoured heavy cavalry: Saladin&#x27;s mamluks (also termed ghulams), Kurdish troops, and the contingents of the emirs and princes of Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia. The army was divided into three parts, left and right wings and centre. Saladin directed his army from beneath his banners, surrounded by his bodyguard and accompanied by his kettle-drummers.

=== Saladin&#x27;s attack ===
In an attempt to destroy the cohesion of the Crusader army and unsettle their resolve, the Ayyubid onslaught was accompanied by the clashing of cymbals and gongs, trumpets blowing and men screaming war-cries.

&quot;In truth, our people, so few in number, were hemmed in by the multitudes of the Saracens, that they had no means of escape, if they tried; neither did they seem to have valour sufficient to withstand so many foes, nay, they were shut in, like a flock of sheep in the jaws of wolves, with nothing but the sky above, and the enemy all around them.&quot;

The repeated Ayyubid harrying attacks followed the same pattern: the Bedouin and Nubians on foot launched arrows and javelins into the enemy lines, before parting to allow the mounted archers to advance, attack and wheel off, a well-practiced technique. Crusader crossbowmen responded, when this was possible, although the chief task among the Crusaders was simply to preserve their ranks in the face of sustained provocation. When the incessant attacks of skirmishers failed to have the desired effect, the weight of the attack was switched to the rear of the Crusader column, with the Hospitallers coming under the greatest pressure. Here the right wing of the Ayyubid army made a desperate attack on the squadron of Hospitaller knights and the infantry corps covering them. The Hospitallers could be attacked from both their rear and flank. Many of the Hospitaller infantry had to walk backwards in order to keep their faces, and shields, to the enemy. Saladin, eager to urge his soldiers into closer combat, personally entered the fray, accompanied by two pages leading spare horses. Sayf al-Din (Saphadin), Saladin&#x27;s brother, was also engaged in actively encouraging the troops; both brothers were thus exposing themselves to considerable danger from crossbow fire.

=== Hospitallers break formation and charge ===
All Saladin&#x27;s best efforts could not dislocate the Crusader column, or halt its advance in the direction of Arsuf. Richard was determined to hold his army together, forcing the enemy to exhaust themselves in repeated charges, with the intention of holding his knights for a concentrated counter-attack at just the right moment. There were risks in this, because the army was not only marching under severe enemy provocation, but the troops were suffering from heat and thirst. Just as serious the Saracens were killing so many horses that some of Richard&#x27;s own knights began to wonder if a counter-strike would be possible. Many of the unhorsed knights joined the infantry.

Just as the vanguard entered Arsuf in the middle of the afternoon, the Hospitaller crossbowmen to the rear were having to load and shoot walking backwards. Inevitably they lost cohesion, and the enemy was quick to take advantage of this opportunity, moving into any gap wielding their swords and maces. For the Crusaders, the Battle of Arsuf had now entered a critical stage. Garnier de Nablus repeatedly pleaded with Richard to be allowed to attack. He was refused, the Master was ordered to maintain position and await the signal for a general assault, six clear trumpet blasts. Richard knew that the charge of his knights needed to be reserved until the Ayyubid army was fully committed, closely engaged, and the Saracens&#x27; horses had begun to tire. Whether through a lack of discipline or acting on Richard’s delegated authority, the Order’s marshal and one of Richard’s household knights, Baldwin le Carron, moved through their own infantry and charged into the Saracen ranks with a cry of “St. George!”; they were then followed by the rest of the Hospitaller knights. Moved by this example, the French knights of the corps immediately preceding the Hospitallers also charged.

The traditionally accepted version of events is that Garnier de Nablus and the Hospitaller cavalry charged when goaded beyond endurance, and did so in direct disobedience of Richard&#x27;s orders. However, this version has been challenged. The established viewpoint draws on two related sources which do not match some other accounts, including Richard’s own letters on the battle. Recently, it has been proposed that Richard may have devolved authority to trusted subordinates to spot and seize any opportune moment to order a charge. Indeed, it is not clear how a trumpet signal would be heard amidst the clashing cymbals and gongs of the Ayyubid army or distinguished from Saladin’s own regular trumpet blasts.

===Crusader counterattack===
If the action of the Hospitallers constituted a breach of discipline, it could have caused Richard&#x27;s whole strategy to unravel. Alternatively, he may have given Baldwin le Carron freedom to act on his own initiative in order to take advantage of a fleeting opportunity. Either way, Richard recognised that the counterattack, once started, had to be supported by all his army and ordered the signal for a general charge to be sounded. Unsupported, the Hospitallers and the other rear units involved in the initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the enemy. The Frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for the knights to pass through and the attack naturally developed in echelon from the rear to the van. To the soldiers of Saladin&#x27;s army, as Baha al-Din noted, the sudden change from passivity to ferocious activity on the part of the Crusaders was disconcerting, and appeared to be the result of a preconceived plan.

Having already been engaged in close combat with the rear of the Crusader column, the right wing of the Ayyubid army was in compact formation and too close to their enemy to avoid the full impact of the charge. Indeed, some of the cavalry of this wing had dismounted in order to loose their arrows more effectively. As a result, the Ayyubids suffered great numbers of casualties, the knights taking a bloody revenge for all they had had to endure earlier in the battle. Baldwin le Carron and the marshal of the Hospitallers had chosen their moment well. Baha al-Din noted that &quot;the rout was complete.&quot; He had been in the centre division of Saladin&#x27;s army, when it turned in flight he looked to join the left wing, but found that it also was in rapid flight. Noting the disintegration of the right wing he finally sought Saladin&#x27;s personal banners, but found only seventeen members of the bodyguard and a lone drummer still with them.

Being aware that an over-rash pursuit was the greatest danger when fighting armies trained in the fluid tactics of the Turks, Richard halted the charge after about had been covered. The right flank Crusader units (including the English and Normans), which had formed the van of the column, had not yet been heavily engaged in close combat. They constituted a ready-made reserve, on which the rest regrouped. Freed from the pressure of being actively pursued, many of the Ayyubid troops turned to cut down those of the knights who had unwisely drawn ahead of the rest. James d&#x27;Avesnes, the commander of one of the Franco-Flemish units, was the most prominent of those killed in this episode. Amongst the Ayyubid leaders who rallied quickly and returned to the fight was Taqi al-Din, Saladin&#x27;s nephew. He led 700 men of the Sultan&#x27;s own bodyguard against Richard&#x27;s left flank. Once their squadrons were back in order, Richard led his knights in a second charge and the forces of Saladin broke once again.

Leading by example, Richard was in the heart of the fighting, as the &quot;Itinerarium&quot; describes:
There the king, the fierce, the extraordinary king, cut down the Turks in every direction, and none could escape the force of his arm, for wherever he turned, brandishing his sword, he carved a wide path for himself: and as he advanced and gave repeated strokes with his sword, cutting them down like a reaper with his sickle, the rest, warned by the sight of the dying, gave him more ample space, for the corpses of the dead Turks which lay on the face of the earth extended over half a mile.

Alert to the danger presented to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.

==Aftermath==

As always with medieval battles, losses are difficult to assess with any precision. The Christian chroniclers claim that Saladin&#x27;s force lost 32 emirs and 7,000 men, but it is possible that the true number may have been fewer. Ambroise mentions that Richard&#x27;s troops counted several thousand bodies of dead Saracen soldiers on the field of battle after the rout. Baha al-Din records only three deaths amongst the leaders of the Ayyubid army: Musek, Grand-Emir of the Kurds, Kaimaz el Adeli and Lighush. King Richard&#x27;s own dead are said to have numbered no more than 700. The only Crusader leader of note to die in the battle was James d&#x27;Avesnes; a French knight of whom Ambroise made the claim that he cut down 15 Saracen cavalrymen before being killed.

Arsuf was an important victory. The Ayyubid army was not destroyed, despite the considerable casualties it suffered, but it did rout; this was considered shameful by the Muslims and boosted the morale of the Crusaders. A contemporary opinion stated that, had Richard been able to choose the moment to unleash his knights, rather than having to react to the actions of an insubordinate unit commander, the Crusader victory might have been much more effective. Possibly being so complete a victory that it would have disabled Saladin&#x27;s forces for a long time. After the rout Saladin was able to regroup and attempted to resume his skirmishing method of warfare but to little effect; shaken by the Crusaders&#x27; sudden and devastatingly effective counterattack at Arsuf, he was no longer willing to risk a further full-scale attack. Arsuf had dented Saladin&#x27;s reputation as an invincible warrior, and proved Richard&#x27;s courage as a soldier and his skill as a commander. Richard was able to take, defend and hold Jaffa – a strategically crucial move toward securing Jerusalem. Also Saladin had to evacuate and demolish most of the fortresses of southern Palestine: Ascalon, Gaza, Blanche-Garde, Lydda and Ramleh, as he realised he could not hold them. Richard took the fortress of Darum, the sole fortress that Saladin had garrisoned, with only his own household troops, so low had Saracen morale been reduced. By depriving Saladin of the coast, Richard seriously threatened Saladin&#x27;s hold on Jerusalem. Richard spent time at Jaffa to rebuild the fortifications that Saladin had pre-emptively destroyed in the summer of 1190 in anticipation that the city would be useful to the Crusaders.

Although the Third Crusade, in the end, failed to retake Jerusalem, a three-year truce was eventually negotiated with Saladin. The truce, known as the Treaty of Jaffa, ensured that Christian pilgrims from the west would once again be allowed to visit Jerusalem. Saladin also recognised the Crusaders&#x27; control of the Levantine coast as far south as Jaffa. Both sides had become exhausted by the struggle, Richard needed to return to Europe in order to protect his patrimony from the aggression of Philip of France, and Palestine was in a ruinous state.

<text>Ivan Meštrović (; 15 August 1883 – 16 January 1962) was a Croatian and Yugoslav sculptor, architect, and writer. He was the most prominent modern Croatian sculptor and a leading artistic personality in contemporary Zagreb. He studied at Pavle Bilinić&#x27;s Stone Workshop in Split and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he was formed under the influence of the Secession. He traveled throughout Europe and studied the works of ancient and Renaissance masters, especially Michelangelo, and French sculptors Auguste Rodin, Antoine Bourdelle and Aristide Maillol. He was the initiator of the national-romantic group Medulić (he advocated the creation of art of national features inspired by the heroic folk songs). During the First World War, he lived in emigration. After the war, he returned to Croatia and began a long and fruitful period of sculpture and pedagogical work. In 1942 he emigrated to Italy, in 1943 to Switzerland and in 1947 to the United States. He was a professor of sculpture at the Syracuse University and from 1955 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana.

Most of his early works of symbolic themes were formed in the spirit of the Secession, some of which, like the Well of Life, show impressionist restless surfaces created under the influence of Rodin&#x27;s naturalism, and the second, reviving national myth, become stylized monumental plastics (Kosovo cycle, 1908-1910). Before the First World War, he left pathetic epic stylization, expressing increasingly emotional states, as evidenced by the wooden reliefs of biblical themes made in a combination of Archaic, Gothic, Secessionist and Expressionist styles. During the 1920s and 1930s, the classical component prevailed in his works. In this period, he created a number of public monuments of strong plastic expression, pronounced and legible shapes (Gregory of Nin and Marko Marulić in Split, Andrija Medulić, Andrija Kačić-Miošić and Josip Juraj Strossmayer in Zagreb, Pobednik in Belgrade, Svetozar Miletić in Novi Sad and &quot;The Bowman&quot; and &quot;The Spearman&quot; in Chicago). Portraits take a special place in his opus.

Meštrović achieved works of strong plastic value in the construction-sculptural monuments and projects, mostly with central layout (the Mausoleum of the Račić family in Cavtat, the Mausoleum of the Meštrović family in Otavice, the Meštrović Pavilion in Zagreb, Monument to the Unknown Hero in Belgrade). He also designed a memorial church of King Zvonimir in Biskupija near Knin inspired by old Croatian churches, a representative family palace, today the Ivan Meštrović Gallery, and reconstructed renaissance fortified mansion Crikvine-Kaštilac in Split.

==Life==
===Early life===
He was born in Vrpolje, Slavonia, and spent his childhood in the small Dalmatian village of Otavice, the native place of his parents in the Dinaric Alps. His father was a poor peasant and sheep-breeder. At the age of sixteen he was accepted as an apprentice by Pavle Bilinić, a master of a stonemasonry in Split.

His artistic skills were improved by studying the monumental buildings in the city and his education at the hands of Bilinić&#x27;s wife, who was a high-school teacher. Soon, they found a mine owner from Vienna who paid for Meštrović to move there and be admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Edmund von Hellmer and Otto Wagner. Quickly he had to learn German from scratch and adjust to the new environment, but he persevered and successfully finished his studies.
In 1905 he had his first exhibit with the Secession Group in Vienna, noticeably influenced by the Art Nouveau style. His work quickly became popular, even with the likes of Auguste Rodin who once said that Meštrović is the greatest phenomenon among sculptors and even greater sculptor than he was. Because of that popularity he soon earned enough for him and his wife (since 1904), Ruža Klein, to travel to more international exhibitions.

In 1908 Meštrović moved to Paris and the sculptures made in this period earned him international reputation. At this time, Ivan was a friend of the cubist painter Jelena Dorotka (&quot;Helene Dorotka von Ehrenwall&quot;). In 1911 he moved to Zagreb, and soon after to Rome where he received the grand prix for the Serbian Pavilion on the 1911 Rome International Exhibition. There his work was praised as being strong and monumental compared to the &quot;soft and ineffectual&quot; pieces exhibited by his contemporaries, Hugo Lederer, Anton Hanak, and Franz Metzner. He remained in Rome, spending four years studying ancient Greek sculpture.

Meštrović became a supporter of Yugoslavism and Yugoslav identity after he traveled to Serbia and became impressed with Serb culture. He created a sculpture of Serbian folk-legend hero Prince Marko for the International Exhibition of Art (1911), which was exhibited along with 73 sculptures at the pavilion of Kingdom of Serbia. When asked about the statue, Meštrović replied &quot;This Marko is our Yugoslav people with its gigantic and noble heart&quot;. Meštrović wrote poetry speaking of a &quot;Yugoslav race&quot;. Those who knew Meštrović&#x27;s views referred to him as &quot;The Prophet of Yugoslavism&quot;. He also participated in 1911 at the Turin International.

===First World War and Yugoslavia===
At the onset of World War I, after the assassination in Sarajevo, Meštrović tried to move back to Split via Venice, but was dissuaded by threats made against him because of his political opposition to the Austro-Hungarian authorities. During the war he travelled to present exhibits in Paris, Cannes, London and in Switzerland. He was a founding member of the Yugoslav Committee.

He was the first artist of Croatian origin to exhibit his work at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London, in 1915.

After World War I he moved back home to the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and met the second love of his life, Olga Kesterčanek, whom he married shortly thereafter. They had four children: Marta, Tvrtko, Maria and Mate, all of whom were born in Zagreb, where Ivan and Olga settled in 1922. He was a contemporary and friend of Nikola Tesla. Meštrović and his family would later spend the winter months in their mansion in Zagreb and the summer months in a summer house he built by the end of the 1930s in Split. He became a professor and later the director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, and proceeded to build numerous internationally renowned works as well as many donated chapels and churches and grants to art students.

By 1923 he designed the mausoleum for the Račić Family Memorial Chapel in Cavtat, also known as Our Lady of the Angels. He also created a set of statues for a never-built Yugoslav national temple that would have been erected in Kosovo to commemorate the 1389 Battle of Kosovo.

Meštrović sculpted numerous sculptures commissioned by the Karađorđević dynasty, especially Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Among the orders of King Alexander are sculptures of a sphinx, Miloš Obilić, Marko Kraljević, the hero of the Kosovo myth Srđa Zlopogleđa, sculptures of female counterparts to Kosovo&#x27;s heroes, as well as a self-portrait of Meštrović. Most of the commissioned sculptures had the idea of an integral Yugoslav nation as ideological background. Today, the works are mostly located within the royal compound in Dedinje. Meštrović had a role in the constitution of Yugoslav national identity.

He continued to travel to post his exhibits around the world: he displayed at the Brooklyn Museum in New York in 1924, in Chicago in 1925, he even travelled to Egypt and Palestine in 1927. In 1927 he entered a design for the coins of the Irish Free State, and though his design arrived too late for consideration it was adopted in 1965 as the seal of the Central Bank of Ireland.

===Second World War===

During the April War in 1941 Meštrović was living in Split. After being warned by novelist and Independent State of Croatia (NDH) minister Mile Budak that the Croatian authorities could not guarantee his safety in Split, he moved to Zagreb in September 1941. Meštrović and painter Jozo Kljaković were arrested by the Ustaše in Zagreb on 7 November 1941, ostensibly due to the regime&#x27;s fears that the two would emigrate. He eventually served three and a half months in the Savska Cesta prison. With help from archbishop Aloysius Stepinac and subsequently the Vatican he was released, on condition that he travel to Venice to attend the Independent State of Croatia pavilion at the Venice Biennale. From there he relocated to Rome, where he stayed and worked at the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome. He was sponsored here by Fra Dominik Mandić, and during his time in the city was received by Pope Pius XII. In July 1943, Meštrović secured a visa to Switzerland through NDH diplomat Stijepo Perić and moved there. Not all of his family managed to escape — his first wife Ruža died in 1942 and many from her Jewish family were murdered in the Holocaust. Later, his brother Petar was imprisoned for publicly advising Ivan not to return to the country. Looking to create a more favorable image of the newly established socialist regime in Yugoslavia, Marshal Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s government invited Meštrović to return to the country after World War II ended, but he refused to do so. His decision was final after he received a letter from a high-ranking communist official warning him that he would be given a prominent position such as at a national academy and expected to display complete obedience to the Communist Party. In 1946, Syracuse University offered him a professorship, and he moved to the United States. He became the first artist of Croatian origin to exhibit his work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 1947.

From 1951 he began making contributions to the Croatian emigrant journal &quot;Hrvatska revija&quot;, which would later publish his memoirs. He was awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters&#x27; Gold Medal for sculpture in 1953. President Dwight D. Eisenhower personally presided over the 1954 ceremony granting Meštrović American citizenship. He went on to become a professor at the University of Notre Dame in 1955.

At the end of January 1951 Meštrović joined the American campaign for the release of Archbishop Stepinac from prison.

===Later years ===
Before he died, Meštrović returned to Yugoslavia one last time to visit with the imprisoned Cardinal Stepinac and with Tito. At the request of various people from his homeland he sent 59 statues from the United States to Yugoslavia (including the monument of Petar Petrovic-Njegos), and in 1952 signed off his Croatian estates to the people of Croatia, including more than 400 sculptures and numerous drawings. Upon his return he vowed to his colleague painter Jozo Kljaković that he would not return to the country as long as the communists were in power.
Two of his children predeceased him. His daughter Marta, who moved with him to the U.S., died in 1949 at the age of 24. His son Tvrtko, who remained in Zagreb, was 39 when he died in 1961.

In 1960 he suffered a minor stroke which affected his eyesight. In 1961, his memoir, &quot;Uspomene na političke ljude i događaje&quot; (Reminiscences of Political People and Events), was published by the Croatian emigrant publishing house &quot;Hrvatska revija&quot; (&quot;Croatian Review&quot;) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1969, they were published by &quot;Matica hrvatska&quot; in Zagreb.

After creating four clay sculptures to memorialize his children, Meštrović died in early 1962, aged 79, in South Bend, Indiana. His funeral mass was celebrated by the bishops of Šibenik, Josip Arnerić, and bishop of Split-Makarska Frane Franić. His remains were interred at a mausoleum in his childhood home of Otavice. Communist Yugoslav authorities had originally promised the Meštrović family that his remains could lie in repose at the cathedrals in Zagreb and Split. Once his remains had arrived in Yugoslavia, however, the authorities reneged and did not allow this to take place. After communist officials interfered during his funeral, his son Mate Meštrović sharply criticized the level of religious freedom in the country.

His son, Mate, is a Croatian-American diplomat, university professor and editor at &quot;Time&quot; magazine, who served as a lieutenant in the US Army PsyWar. Later, he served as president of the Croatian National Congress and lobbied on behalf of Croatian self-determination in Washington, D.C., Western Europe and Australia, and was a deputy in the Croatian Parliament, a member of Croatia&#x27;s delegation to the Council of Europe, and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He also served as an ambassador in the Foreign Ministry.

Meštrović&#x27;s grandson Stjepan is an American sociology professor at Texas A&amp;M and author of several books.

==Reputation and legacy==

His sculptural strengths are manifested in the lyrical and dramatic expression of the human body. Critics in Europe and the United States ranked him highly in the first half of the 20th century. He is one of the most prominent Croatian artists whose work has at times gained worldwide recognition.

Professor Miljenko Jurkovic of the University of Zagreb states he:
:is the most renowned modern Croatian sculptor. His works combine various influences, and they are both monumental and poetic. He sculpted in stone, bronze and wood, covering a diverse range of themes – spreading to religious, portraits and symbolic themes.

Historians Wojciech Roszkowski and Jan Kofman report: &quot;Meštrović&#x27;s sculpture of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Field won first prize at an international exhibition in 1911, and critics acclaimed him the greatest sculptor of modern times.&quot;

Auguste Rodin&#x27;s evaluation was often quoted: &quot;Meštrović was the greatest phenomena among the sculptors&quot; of his time.

Alonzo Lansford, editor of &quot;Arts Magazine&quot; in New York City, reviewed the Mestrovic show of 1947 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He wrote: &quot;It is therefore singularly significant that he is almost unanimously revered by American sculptors of all schools as one of the greatest living sculptors.&quot;

Several streets in Serbia are named after him.

In 2013, Meštrović was named honorary citizen of the Croatian town Drniš.

==Work==

Meštrovic created over fifty monuments during his two years in Paris (1908–1910).
The theme of the Battle of Kosovo particularly moved him, prompting one of his first great works, the Paris Kosovo Monument, as well as other works in bronze and stone. Much of his early work commemorated such epic moments from Slavic history, as he attempted to foster the pan-Slavic cause in his native country.

With the creation of the first Yugoslavia, Meštrović&#x27;s focus shifted to more mundane topics such as musical instruments or chapels. He particularly oriented himself towards religious items, mostly made of wood, under artistic influence from the Byzantine and Gothic architecture. The most renowned works from his early period are the &quot;Crucifix&quot; and &quot;Madonna&quot;; later he became inspired by Michelangelo Buonarroti and created a large number of stone reliefs and portraits. The Croatian dinar featured Meštrović&#x27;s work &quot;History of the Croats&quot;.

It is closely related to the common starling (&quot;S. vulgaris&quot;), but has a much more restricted range, confined to the Iberian Peninsula, Northwest Africa, southernmost France, and the islands of Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. It is largely non-migratory.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

Subsequent to the recent split of the genus &quot;Sturnus&quot;, this species and the common starling are the only species retained in the genus. Hybrids with the common starling are found occasionally where the breeding ranges overlap in southwestern France and northeastern Spain.

==Description==

The adult spotless starling is very similar to the common starling, but marginally larger (21–23 cm length; 70–100 g weight), and has darker, oily-looking black plumage, slightly purple- or green-glossed in bright light, which is entirely spotless in spring and summer, and only with very small pale spots in winter plumage, formed by the pale tips of the feathers. It also differs in having conspicuously longer throat feathers (twice the length of those on common starlings), forming a shaggy &quot;beard&quot; which is particularly obvious when the bird is singing. Its legs are bright pink. In summer, the bill is yellow with a bluish base in males and a pinkish base in females; in winter, it is duller, often blackish. Young birds are dull brown, darker than young common starlings, and have a black bill and brown legs. Confusion with the common starling is particularly easy during the winter, when common starlings are abundant throughout the spotless starling&#x27;s range, but also in summer where their breeding ranges overlap in northeastern Spain and the far southwest of France. It can also be confused with the common blackbird (&quot;Turdus merula&quot;), which differs most obviously in its longer tail and lack of plumage gloss.

Like the common starling, it walks rather than hops, and has a strong direct flight, looking triangular-winged and short-tailed. It is a noisy bird and a good mimic; its calls are similar to the common starling&#x27;s, but louder.

==Distribution and habitat ==
The spotless starling uses a wide range of habitats and can be found in any reasonably open environment, from farmland and olive groves to human habitation. The highest population densities are in open grazed holm oak woods, and in urban habitats such as Gibraltar, where it is common. The population has grown in recent decades with a northward expansion in range, spreading to the whole of Spain (previously absent from the northeast) between 1950 and 1980, and colonising locally along the southern coast of mainland France since 1983. Like its more common relative, it is an omnivore, taking a wide variety of invertebrates, berries, and human-provided scraps. It is gregarious, forming sizeable flocks, often mixed with common starlings, of up to 100,000 in winter.

Like most starlings, it is a cavity-nesting species, breeding in tree holes, buildings and in cliff crevices. It typically lays three to five eggs.

<text>Eschscholzia is a genus of 12 annual or perennial plants in the Papaveraceae (poppy) family. The genus was named after the Baltic German/Imperial Russian botanist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz (1793–1831). All species are native to Mexico or the southern United States.

==Description==
Leaves are deeply cut, glabrous and glaucous, mostly basal, though a few grow on the stem.

Flowers have four yellow or orange petals, and grow at the end of the stem, either alone or in many-flowered cymes. The petals are wedge-shaped, forming a funnel. The two fused sepals fall off as the flower bud opens. There are 12 to numerous stamens. The flowers close in cloudy weather.

Seeds are tiny and black, held in long pointed pods that split open when ripe often with enough force to fling the seeds some distance with an audible snap.

The taproot gives off a colorless or orange clear juice, which is mildly toxic.

==Cultivation==
The best-known species is the California poppy (&quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;), the state flower of California. &quot;Eschscholzia caespitosa&quot; is very similar to &quot;E. californica&quot;, but smaller and without a collar below the petals.

Another species common in cultivation is &quot;Eschscholzia lobbii&quot;, which is often sold as &quot;Eschscholzia caespitosa&quot;. &quot;E. lobbii&quot; has yellow flowers and very narrow leaves.

They prosper in warm, dry climates, but withstand some frost. They grow in poor soils with good water drainage.

The cultivars &#x27;Apricot Chiffon&#x27;, with orange/yellow flowers, and &#x27;Rose Chiffon&#x27;, with pink and cream flowers, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>A landform is a natural or anthropogenic land feature on the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Landforms include hills, mountains, canyons, and valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great oceanic basins.

== Physical characteristics ==
Landforms are categorized by characteristic physical attributes such as elevation, slope, orientation, structure
stratification, rock exposure, and soil type. Gross physical features or landforms include intuitive elements such as berms, cliffs, hills, mounds, peninsulas, ridges, rivers, valleys, volcanoes, and numerous other structural and size-scaled (e.g. ponds vs. lakes, hills vs. mountains) elements including various kinds of inland and oceanic waterbodies and sub-surface features. Hills, mountains, plains, and plateaus are the four major types of landforms on Earth. Minor landforms include basins, buttes, canyons, and valleys. Tectonic plate movements under Earth&#x27;s crust can create landforms by pushing up hills and mountains.

== Hierarchy of classes ==


Continents and oceans exemplify the highest-order landforms. Landform elements are parts of a high-order landforms that can be further identified and systematically given a cohesive definition such as hill-tops, shoulders, saddles, foreslopes and backslopes.

Some generic landform elements including: pits, peaks, channels, ridges, passes, pools and plains.

Terrain (or &quot;relief&quot;) is the third or vertical dimension of &quot;land surface&quot;. Topography is the study of terrain, although the word is often used as a synonym for relief itself. When relief is described underwater, the term bathymetry is used. In cartography, many different techniques are used to describe relief, including contour lines and triangulated irregular networks.

Elementary landforms (segments, facets, relief units) are the smallest homogeneous divisions of the land surface, at the given scale/resolution. These are areas with relatively homogeneous morphometric properties, bounded by lines of discontinuity. A plateau or a hill can be observed at various scales, ranging from a few hundred meters to hundreds of kilometers. Hence, the spatial distribution of landforms is often scale-dependent, as is the case for soils and geological strata.

A number of factors, ranging from plate tectonics to erosion and deposition (also due to human activity), can generate and affect landforms. Biological factors can also influence landforms—for example, note the role of vegetation in the development of dune systems and salt marshes, and the work of corals and algae in the formation of coral reefs.

Landforms do not include several man-made features, such as canals, ports and many harbors; and geographic features, such as deserts, forests, and grasslands. Many of the terms are not restricted to refer to features of the planet Earth, and can be used to describe surface features of other planets and similar objects in the Universe. Examples are mountains, hills, polar caps, and valleys, which are found on all of the terrestrial planets.

The scientific study of landforms is known as geomorphology.

In onomastic terminology, toponyms (geographical proper names) of individual landform objects (mountains, hills, valleys, etc.) are called &quot;oronyms&quot;.

==Recent developments==
Landforms may be extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) using some automated techniques where the data has been gathered by modern satellites and stereoscopic aerial surveillance cameras. Until recently, compiling the data found in such data sets required time consuming and expensive techniques involving many man-hours. The most detailed DEMs available are measured directly using LIDAR techniques.

<text>&quot;Our Fatherland&quot; is the national anthem of Armenia. It was arranged by Barsegh Kanachyan; the lyrics were written by Mikayel Nalbandian. First adopted in 1918 as the anthem of the short-lived First Republic of Armenia, it was subsequently banned after the country was invaded by then incorporated into the Soviet Union. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the restoration of sovereignty in 1991, the song was re-adopted as the national anthem, albeit with slightly modified lyrics.

==History==
===Composition===
The lyrics of &quot;Our Fatherland&quot; were derived from &quot;The Song of an Italian Girl&quot; ( ), a poem written by Mikael Nalbandian in 1861. In the early 20th century, the music was composed by Barsegh Kanachyan. Subsequently, both the lyrics and music were adopted as the national anthem of the First Republic of Armenia, which briefly existed from 1918 to 1920.

===Soviet era===
In November 1920, the Red Army invaded Armenia, in spite of the Treaty of Sèvres – which granted the country international recognition as a sovereign state – having been signed only three months earlier. In 1922, it was absorbed into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (TSFSR), together with Azerbaijan and Georgia, and the TSFSR subsequently became part of the Soviet Union at the end of that same year. As a symbol of Armenian nationalism, the song &quot;Our Fatherland&quot; was outlawed by the Bolshevik authorities. In its place, the Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was utilized from 1944 onwards. Because of this, &quot;Our Fatherland&quot; took on a new status as a protest song against Soviet rule during this time.

===Restoration of sovereignty and beyond===
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the song &quot;Our Fatherland&quot; was reinstated as Armenia&#x27;s national anthem on 1 July 1991 by the constituent republic&#x27;s Supreme Soviet. The lyrics are not identical to the 1918 version, however, because several words have been modified. As an intrinsic element of civic education in Armenia, the anthem is one of several national symbols which are featured in classrooms of the country&#x27;s schools. By dignifying the song in this manner, teachers reckon that this &quot;encourage[s] students to sing the national anthem every day&quot;.

A debate of the national anthem was a question in the Armenian Parliament in 2006 and in 2019. The new government had called for the restoration of the Soviet era anthem with newer lyrics in its place.

The Italian violist Marco Misciagna composed the &quot;Introduction and Variations on Mer Hayrenik” for viola solo, and in 2018, he played it during a concert at the Komitas Chamber Music House.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of the national anthem promotes the worthiness of &quot;dying for the freedom&quot; of Armenia. Its discussion of death, however, has led several commentators to complain that the anthem is overly &quot;wimpy&quot; and &quot;gloomy&quot;. Specifically, some members of the National Assembly are of the opinion that the song – written at the time of the first fight for independence – does not accurately reflect the present era of triumph and success. However, none of the proposals to replace &quot;Our Fatherland&quot; have come to fruition, as the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) – which were part of the coalition government – have so far resisted efforts to change the national anthem, especially proposals to replace it with one based on the music of the anthem of the Armenian SSR.

===Current version===

===Original version===
The national anthem is based on the first, third, fourth and sixth stanzas of Nalbandian&#x27;s poem &quot;The Song of an Italian Girl&quot;. The original text uses archaic spellings prior to the Armenian orthography reform.


==In popular culture==
The title of the national anthem is used as the name of a television channel for Armenian expatriates residing in Russia. Mer Hayrenik TV is based in the city of Novosibirsk, the administrative centre of both Novosibirsk Oblast and the Siberian Federal District.

<text>Sir Quentin Saxby Blake (born 16 December 1932) is an English cartoonist, caricaturist, illustrator and children&#x27;s writer. He has illustrated over 300 books, including 18 written by Roald Dahl, which are among his most popular works. For his lasting contribution as a children&#x27;s illustrator, Blake won the biennial international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2002, the highest recognition available to creators of children&#x27;s books. From 1999 to 2001, he was the inaugural British Children&#x27;s Laureate. Blake is a patron of the Association of Illustrators.

==Early life==
Blake was born on 16 December 1932 in Sidcup, Kent, son of William and Evelyn Blake. His father was a civil servant, and his mother a housewife. Blake was evacuated to the West Country during the Second World War. He attended Holy Trinity Lamorbey Church of England Primary School and Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School, where his English teacher, J. H. Walsh, influenced his life&#x27;s work. 

Blake’s artistic development during his school years was helped by contact with the painter and cartoonist Alfred Jackson, the husband of Blake&#x27;s Latin teacher, who encouraged his first submissions to &quot;Punch&quot;, resulting in his first publication at the age of 16. In the sixth form, the school&#x27;s art teacher, the painter Stanley Simmonds, recognized Blake&#x27;s talents and provided support and exposure to the work of other artists. 

Blake read English Literature at Downing College, Cambridge, under F. R. Leavis, from 1953 to 1956, received his postgraduate teaching diploma from the University of London Institute of Education, and later studied part-time at the Chelsea School of Art and later Camberwell College of Art. He has since denied that studying at the University of Cambridge contributed to his artistic or creative talent.

==Career==

During the 1960s, Blake taught English at the Lycée Français de Londres which cemented his long association with France and culminated in the award of the Legion of Honour. He taught at the Royal College of Art for over 20 years, where he was head of the Illustration department from 1978 to 1986.

The first book Blake illustrated was &quot;The Wonderful Button&quot; by Evan Hunter, published by Abelard-Schuman in 1961. In his subsequent career, Blake gained a reputation as a loyal, reliable and humorous illustrator of more than 300 children&#x27;s books, including some written by Joan Aiken, Elizabeth Bowen, Sylvia Plath, Roald Dahl, Nils-Olof Franzén, William Steig, and Dr. Seuss. He illustrated the first Seuss book that Seuss did not illustrate himself, &quot;Great Day for Up!&quot; (1974).

By 2006, Blake had illustrated 323 books, of which he had written 35 and Dahl had written 18. To date, Blake has illustrated two of David Walliams&#x27; books and has illustrated Folio Society Limited Editions such as &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;50 Fables of La Fontaine&quot;.

In the 1970s, Blake was an occasional presenter of the BBC children&#x27;s storytelling programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;, when he would illustrate the stories on a canvas as he was telling them. In 1993, Blake designed the five British Christmas issue postage stamps featuring episodes from &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens.

Blake is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club. He is patron of the Blake Society, Downing College&#x27;s arts and humanities society. Blake is also a patron of &quot;The Big Draw&quot;, which aims to get people drawing throughout the United Kingdom, and of The Nightingale Project, a charity that provides art to hospitals. Since 2006, he has produced work for several hospitals and mental health centres in the London area, a children&#x27;s hospital (Hopital Armand Trousseau) in Paris, and a maternity hospital in Angers, France. These projects are detailed in Blake&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;Quentin Blake: Beyond the Page&quot;, which describes how, in his seventies, his work has increasingly appeared outside the pages of books, in public places such as hospitals, theatre foyers, galleries and museums. In 2007, Blake designed a huge mural on fabric, suspended over and thus disguising a ramshackle building immediately opposite an entrance to St Pancras railway station. The rendering of an &quot;imaginary welcoming committee&quot; greets passengers arriving on the Eurostar high-speed railway.

Blake is a supporter of and ambassador for the indigenous rights NGO Survival International. In 2009, he said, &quot;For me, Survival is important for two reasons; one is that I think right that we should give help and support to people who are threatened by the rapacious industrial society we have created; and the other that, more generally, it gives an important signal about how we all ought to be looking after the world. Its message is the most fundamental of any charity I&#x27;m connected with.&quot;

Blake is the Founding Trustee of House of Illustration, a centre in London for exhibitions, educational events and activities related to the art of illustration. He was also the subject of the first exhibition at this venue, entitled Inside Stories&quot;, which opened in July 2014. In August 2020, it was announced that the centre will be relocating to the 18th century Engine House at New River Head in the Clerkenwell area of London and will be renamed the &quot;Quentin Blake Centre for Illustration&quot;.

Besides children&#x27;s books, Blake is also the designer of Ben, the logo of the shop chain Ben&#x27;s Cookies. He designed several illustrations for the story time segments for the Scottish TV series &quot;Squeak!&quot;.

In 2023, Blake was asked by &quot;Blue Peter&quot; to design a new &quot;Blue Peter badge&quot; which they have called their Book badge.

==Personal life==
Blake has never been married and has no children. He lives in South Kensington, West London.

Blake was additionally the artist behind the comic strip &quot;Waldo and Wanda&quot;, written by John Yeoman.

==Honours and awards==
Blake was the inaugural British Children&#x27;s Laureate (1999–2001) and was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Arts in 2001. He received the biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award from the International Board on Books for Young People for his career contribution to children&#x27;s literature in 2002. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours for his services to children&#x27;s literature. In France, he was made a Knight of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2002 and elevated to Officer in 2007.

For &quot;Mister Magnolia&quot;, which he also wrote, Blake won the 1980 Kate Greenaway Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book illustration by a British subject. For the 50th anniversary of the Medal (1955–2005), a panel of experts named it one of the top ten winning works, which composed the ballot for a public election of the nation&#x27;s favourite. He was also a highly commended Greenaway runner-up for &quot;The Wild Washerwomen: A new folk tale&quot;, by John Yeoman (1979), and a commended runner-up for &quot;Clown&quot; (1995), which he wrote himself. He made the Greenaway shortlist for &quot;Zagazoo&quot; (1998), which he wrote, and for &quot;Sad Book&quot; (2004) by Michael Rosen.

Blake won the Kurt Maschler Award, or the Emil, for &quot;All Join In&quot; (Jonathan Cape, 1990), which he wrote and illustrated. The award from Maschler Publications and Booktrust annually recognised one British &quot;work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other.&quot;

Blake was awarded the Prince Philip Designers Prize in 2011, and received the Eleanor Farjeon Award in November 2012. This annual award administered by Children&#x27;s Book Circle recognises outstanding commitment and contribution to the world of British children&#x27;s books. Blake was knighted in the 2013 New Year Honours for his services to illustration.

In March 2014, he was awarded the insignia of a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur at a ceremony at the Institut Français in London. He is also a Companion of the Guild of St George.

<text>In politics, a regime (also spelled régime) is a system of government that determines access to public office, and the extent of power held by officials. The two broad categories of regimes are democratic and autocratic. A key similarity across all regimes is the presence of rulers of both formal and informal institutions, which interact dynamically to adapt to changes to their environment The CIA website also has a complete list of every country in the world with their respective types of regimes.

== Usage ==
According to Yale professor Juan José Linz there are three main types of political regimes today: democracies, 
totalitarian regimes, and authoritarian regimes, with hybrid regimes sitting between these categories. 

The term regime is often used critically to portray a leader as corrupt or undemocratic. While the term originally referred to any type of government, in modern usage it often has a negative connotation, implying authoritarianism or dictatorship. Merriam-Webster defines a regime simply as a form of government, while the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as &quot;a government, especially an authoritarian one.&quot; 

In contemporary academic discourse, the term &quot;regime&quot; is used more broadly than in popular or journalistic contexts. It refers to &quot;an intermediate stratum between the government, which is responsible for day-to-day decision-making and can be changed relatively easily, and the state, which encompasses a complex bureaucracy tasked with a wide range of coercive and administrative functions.&quot; In global studies and international relations, the concept of &quot;regime&quot; is also used to name international regulatory agencies (see International regime), which lie outside of the control of national governments. Some authors thus distinguish analytically between institutions and regimes while recognizing that they are bound up with each other:

Regimes can thus be defined as sets of protocols and norms embedded either in institutions or institutionalized practices – formal such as states or informal such as the &quot;liberal trade regime&quot; – that are publicly enacted and relatively enduring.It is common to tie an individual or ideology to a government regime i.e. Putin&#x27;s regime in Russia or China&#x27;s Communist regime.

== Types of political regimes ==
=== Authoritarian regimes ===
Authoritarian regimes are systems in which power is highly centralized, and often concentrated in the hands of a single leader or a small elite group. In authoritarian regimes, political opposition is often suppressed, with dissenting voices silenced through tactics such as censorship, imprisonment, or violence. Political freedoms, including freedom of speech and the press, are usually restricted or tightly controlled by the government. While elections may occur in some authoritarian systems, they are frequently neither free nor fair, with outcomes manipulated to secure the dominance of the ruling elite and maintain their hold on power. Political scientist Juan Linz states that an authoritarian government lacks both political pluralism and political mobilization. He states that an authoritarian regime specifically has vague limits on executive power in order to give more control to the executive branch. For instance, Russia demonstrates characteristics of authoritarianism by holding elections, but these are heavily controlled, with significant restrictions placed on opposition parties and candidates, and media outlets operating under state influence. Similarly, China exemplifies an authoritarian regime where the Communist Party maintains strict control over the political system, curtails civil liberties, and limits freedom of expression to ensure its dominance. Another notable example is the Roman Empire under Julius Ceaser which had a highly centralized government that transformed the Republic of Rome to the Roman Empire.
===Totalitarian regimes===
Totalitarian regimes represent the most extreme form of authoritarianism, where the government seeks total control over all aspects of public and private life. In totalitarian regimes, the state exercises control over nearly every aspect of society, encompassing the economy, media, education, culture, and even the personal beliefs and values of individuals. These governments often employ mass surveillance systems, utilizing advanced technology and networks of informants to monitor citizens and suppress any form of opposition. A hallmark of such regimes is the use of state-sponsored terror, which includes tactics like imprisonment, torture, and forced disappearances, instilling fear to maintain authority and ensure compliance. The regime typically upholds a singular political ideology that is promoted through propaganda and state-controlled media, ensuring that all citizens conform to the state&#x27;s views. North Korea is a prominent example of a totalitarian regime, with the Kim family&#x27;s leadership exercising near-complete control over every aspect of life in the country. Similarly, Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler was a totalitarian regime that sought to control not only the state but also the cultural and social lives of its people, using terror and propaganda to maintain power. 

=== Democratic regimes ===

Democratic regimes are characterized by the rule of law, where laws apply equally to all citizens, including government officials. In a democracy, citizens have the right to participate in free and fair elections, where they can vote for representatives and leaders in a competitive process. These regimes typically maintain a political system that ensures multiple political parties can compete for power, reflecting the political pluralism within the society. Additionally, democracies prioritize the protection of civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion, which are fundamental rights guaranteed by the state. A key feature of democratic regimes is the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, ensuring that no one branch holds too much power and that each can act as a check on the others. Examples of democratic regimes include the United States, where power is divided into federal and state systems, and Germany, which features a parliamentary democracy with a strong focus on human rights. The term democracy can have positive connotations, but according to political scientist Samuel Hutington it is important to recognize democracy simply as a system of government with free and fair elections to hold leaders accountable. A notable contemporary viewpoint on democracy is Robert Dahl&#x27;s introduction of &quot;polyarchy&quot; which is notable for being contestable and inclusive. 

==Urban regimes==
Theorists suggest that localized urban regimes exist and are shaped by the unique interplay of interests, institutions, and ideas within a city. They are characterized by the relationships between local government, political elites, and various institutions that all work toward specific policy goals and government structures. Jill Clark argues that these regime types are categorized by economic factors and policymaking within a community. The six urban regime types are entrepreneurial, caretaker, player, progressive, stewardship, and the demand-side.

=== Entrepreneurial ===
An entrepreneurial urban regime is defined as having strong ties to business leaders and is formed to advance a city&#x27;s hierarchy in relation to other cities. This type operates in exclusive venues where important business leaders and politicians deliberate. Leaders in this type of regime focus on gathering votes for reelection by supporting projects that appeal to the community. 

=== Caretaker ===
A caretaker urban regime is designed to preserve the status quo, keep taxes low, and preserve the quality of life in a city. This is often associated with taxpayers and homeowners&#x27; interests. The goal of this regime type is to lower the involvement of the government sector and increase the involvement of the private sector. 

=== Player ===
A player urban regime is characterized by active government involvement in private sector decision-making. This regime type plays a key role in managing and resolving disputes between community groups and businesses, often acting as a mediator to balance competing interests. In some cases, player regimes may use the coercive powers of government to address and resolve crises within the community, ensuring stability and progress. When player regimes align with state-led initiatives and broader governance strategies, they can evolve into stewardship urban regimes, blending collaborative decision-making with a focus on community welfare and sustainable development.

=== Progressive ===
A progressive urban regime emphasizes the redistribution of the benefits of an industrialized and developed society to promote economic equity. The primary focus is on reallocating resources to various groups or areas of a city that are most in need, including ethnic minorities, economically disadvantaged populations, and neighborhoods affected by gentrification. Decision-making in these regimes is often inclusive, allowing all stakeholders a voice in determining who is most deserving of support and how resources are distributed. When progressive regimes incorporate the fiscal accountability and sustainability focus of stewardship regimes, they evolve into activist regimes, blending equity-driven goals with long-term community resilience.

=== Stewardship ===
A stewardship urban regime is defined by its more adversarial stance toward large corporations compared to entrepreneurial regimes. These regimes prioritize safeguarding community interests, ensuring the well-being of local residents over advancing business-centric agendas. Unlike progressive urban regimes, which actively redistribute resources to address inequality, stewardship regimes focus on fiscal accountability, managing taxpayer investments responsibly without direct redistribution efforts. This governance model seeks to strike a balance between advocating for &quot;the little guy&quot; and maintaining a sustainable and equitable investment environment, fostering long-term community resilience.

=== Demand-side ===
Demand-side urban regimes focus on supporting small businesses and revitalizing neighborhoods. These regimes actively encourage and provide state assistance to small enterprises, often establishing state-operated venture capital programs to stimulate entrepreneurship and foster new business development. This strategy enables the government to play a significant role in shaping local economic growth and urban revitalization. Demand-side regimes frequently arise when progressive policies align with governmental initiatives to empower small business owners and promote community-based economic activities.

==Measuring regime==
There are two primary methods for measuring regimes: continuous measures of democracy (e.g., Freedom House (FH), Polity, and the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)) and binary measures of democracy (e.g., Regimes of the World). Continuous measures classify regimes along a scale of democratic and autocratic characteristics, allowing for nuanced differentiation. Historically, these measures primarily focused on distinguishing democracies from autocracies, but have since evolved to include various gradations of governance. In contrast, binary measures classify regimes in simpler terms, categorizing them strictly as either democratic or non-democratic.

Some scholars argue that unless a government meets certain democratic criteria, it cannot be considered a true democracy. However, academics like Stanford professor Philippe C. Schmitter and associate professor Terry Lynn Karl suggest that democracy is better viewed as a matrix of outcomes. This matrix includes factors such as consensus, participation, access, responsiveness, majority rule, parliamentary sovereignty, party government, pluralism, federalism, presidentialism, and checks and balances, offering a more comprehensive framework to evaluate democratic practices.

The V-Dem Institute, an independent research organization, is a prominent example of continuous democracy measurement. It uses a detailed set of indicators, such as access to justice, electoral corruption, and freedom from government-sponsored violence, to assess governance quality. V-Dem relies on country experts who provide subjective ratings for these latent regime characteristics over time, contributing to one of the most comprehensive data sources on democracy worldwide.

<doc id="250523" wikidata="Q234655" url="?curid=250523" title="National anthem of Bahrain">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) the national anthem of Bahrain. Originally composed as an instrumental in 1942, lyrics were added in 1985, which were changed in 2002 following the country&#x27;s transformation from an emirate into a kingdom.

==History==
The anthem was originally composed in 1942 to be played at official events such as receptions, making Bahrain one of the first Arab countries to adopt a national anthem. The leaders of the police band made many modifications and additions to the music over the following years, most significantly in 1972, a year after Bahrain&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom, when it was extended by playing it twice.

In 1985, former leader of the police band Colonel Mohamed Sudqi Ayyash wrote lyrics for the anthem, which were used until 2002. That year, with the emergence of the National Action Charter and a constitutional amendments referendum that declared the country&#x27;s ruler Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifah a king and the country a kingdom, the lyrics were changed by Minister of the Royal Court Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa. Bahraini composer and singer Ahmed Aljumairi was directed by the government to re-arrange the national anthem with an inclusion of a fanfare that was recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in London. Mr. Ahmed Aljumairi sang the national anthem with the chorus in that recording that became the official anthem of the country. Band leader Major General Mubarak Najm Al-Najm made a military band version arrangement that is used by the police.

<doc id="250524" wikidata="Q199739" url="?curid=250524" title="Amar Sonar Bangla">
<text>&quot;&quot; (, ) is the national anthem of Bangladesh. An ode to Mother Bengal, the lyrics were written by Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore, while the melody is derived from Baul singer Gagan Harkara&#x27;s &quot;Ami Kothay Pabo Tare&quot;, set to Dadra tala. The modern instrumental rendition was arranged by Bangladeshi musician Samar Das.

==Etymology==
The word refers to the possessive first-person singular or ; the word is the adjectival form of the root word , meaning ; and the word , which literally translates as or , is used as a term of endearment meaning , but in the song, the words may be interpreted to express the preciousness of Bengal.

== History ==

The song was written in 1905 during the first partition of Bengal, when the ruling British Empire had an undivided province of Bengal Presidency split into two parts; the decision was announced on 20 July by the then-Viceroy of India Lord Curzon, taking effect on 16 October. This divide of Bengal, being along communal lines–East Bengal and Assam having a majority of Muslims and West Bengal having a majority of Hindus–is claimed to have been politically motivated. Along with a host of others, songs such as this were meant to rekindle the unified spirit of Bengal, to raise public consciousness against the communal political divide. The lyrics first appeared in the September issues of &quot;Bongodorshon&quot; and &quot;Baul&quot; simultaneously, in 1905. The song along with the musical notation (referred to as in Bengali), first appeared in the periodical musical journal &quot;Shongeet Biggnan Probeshika&quot; in the same month and year. Indira Devi, Tagore&#x27;s niece, Satyendranath Tagore&#x27;s daughter, jotted down the musical notation hearing it from Tagore himself (this was the common norm, Tagore singing the song, and someone formally jotting down the musical notations).

== Official adaption ==
The first ten lines of the original poem constitute the most commonly sung version of Bangladesh&#x27;s national anthem, adopted in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The instrumental orchestra rendition was composed by Samar Das.

== Lyrics ==
The following provides the lyrics of as written by Rabindranath Tagore. Only the first ten bolded lines of the original lyrics are sung as Bangladesh&#x27;s national anthem. The anthem was translated into English by Syed Ali Ahsan.

==Criticism==
From the late 1970s, Bangladeshi nationalists started to challenge Amar Sonar Bangla as the national anthem and called for adaptation of a more Bangladesh-centric national anthem. In 1975 after the 15 August coup, then President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed set a committee that proposed the replacement of the anthem with Kazi Nazrul Islam&#x27;s &quot;Notuner Gaan&quot; or Farrukh Ahmed&#x27;s &quot;Panjeri&quot;. However, the process was halted after his removal. In 1979, in a letter sent to the Cabinet Division, then Prime Minister Shah Azizur Rahman argued that Amar Sonar Bangla was contradictory to the national identity and the culture of Bangladeshis as it was written by a person who had a non-Bangladeshi background, and proposed the patriotic song &quot;Prothom Bangladesh&quot; () for the national anthem. During the presidency of Ziaur Rahman, the song was played after Amar Sonar Bangla on national television and government programmes. However, after the death of Rahman in 1981, the initiative was stopped and the song lost its status. Today, Prothom Bangladesh is the party anthem of Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

In 2002, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami proposed an amendment to the lyrics of Amar Sonar Bangla, citing Islamic values and spirit. However, the Cabinet Division rejected this proposal.

In 2019, Bangladeshi singer Mainul Ahsan Nobel, who was a runner-up in the Indian-Bengali musical show &quot;Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Bangla&quot;, said that Prince Mahmud&#x27;s song &quot;Bangladesh&quot; depicted the beauty of Bangladesh far better than Amar Sonar Bangla. This remark sparked controversy among Bangladeshis. Later, he apologized for his remark.

In a press conference on 3 September 2024, Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, retired Brigadier General of Bangladesh Army and son of Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Ghulam Azam, called for a replacement of Amar Sonar Bangla, claiming that Indian government had forced the Provisional Government of Bangladesh to adopt the song. He also argued that &quot;Amar Sonar Bangla&quot; contradicted with the characteristics of Bangladesh, as the song was composed in the context of the partition of Bengal to unite the two Bengals. This remark sparked controversy on historical context and the significance of the anthem across the country.

== Notable performances and covers ==

The Ministry of Cultural Affairs planned to stage an event on Bangladesh&#x27;s 44th independence day, in a bid to have the world record of the most people singing a national anthem simultaneously. Consequently, on 2 March, the ministry launched a program titled &quot;Lakho Konthe Sonar Bangla&quot; () whose main objective was to hold an event with the cooperation of Bangladesh Armed Forces where approximately 300,000 people would sing the national anthem. Several popular Bangladeshi musicians and cultural groups later joined the program.

The record was broken at 11:20 on 26 March 2014 by 254,537 participants at Dhaka&#x27;s National Parade Ground. The event was attended by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad, and all the members of the cabinet. After receiving the required evidence, the Guinness Book of World Records approved the record on 9 April 2014. The record was broken by India on 21 January 2017.

<text>The State Anthem of the Republic of Belarus, better known as &quot;We Belarusians&quot;, is the national anthem of Belarus. It was originally written in the 1940s and adopted in 1955 for use in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The music of the Belarusian SSR anthem was composed by Niescier Sakałowski and the lyrics were written by Michas Klimkovič. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the music composed by Sakalowski was kept and the lyrics were discarded. New lyrics, which were written by Klimkovič and Uładzimir Karyzna, were adopted by a presidential decree issued on 2 July 2002.

== Evolution ==

=== Anthem of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic ===
&quot;&quot; was originally used as the anthem of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic starting from 24 February 1955. The original anthem was composed by Sakałowski and the lyrics were written by Michas Klimkovič. It was presented in front of a jury in 1944, but it took 11 years of modifications before it was officially adopted. When Belarus became an independent country, the national anthem was modified to drop the Communist-era lyrics. An attempt was made in 1995 to adopt Natallia Arsiennieva&#x27;s poem &quot;Mahutny Boža&quot; as the national anthem, but the suggestion was not acted on even though it was supported by a parliamentary committee.
=== Anthem of the Republic of Belarus ===

After independence in 1991, the country retained the anthem of the BSSR without lyrics for official use. The only legal mention of a national anthem in Belarusian law before 2002 was in the Constitution of Belarus. Section 1, Article 19 of the constitution states that &quot;[t]he tsymbols of the Republic of Belarus as a sovereign state shall be its national flag, national emblem and national anthem.&quot; While the constitution only mentioned the use of the flag, national anthem, and arms as state symbols, each symbol had to be defined by law. A law specifying a national anthem was not enacted until Presidential Decree 350 took effect on 18 July 2002, the day before Independency Day. The decree&#x27;s main objective was to establish lyrics for the anthem and introduce musical notation along with the new lyrics. Moreover, the decree designated when, where, and how the anthem was to be performed.

According to the newspaper &quot;Soviet Byelorussia&quot;, President Lukashenko decided on the anthem on 12 June 2002 and chose to have its first performance on Independence Day, the anniversary of the date in 1944 when the Wehrmacht was driven away from Minsk by the Red Army. However, the first performance actually took place on 2 July at a concert organized by the government as part of the Belarusian independence festivities.

When Lukashenko issued his decree selecting a new national anthem, only slight changes were made to the Soviet-era hymn. While the references to Russia, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Vladimir Lenin were replaced; the overall theme of &quot;friendship of peoples&quot; and the original music composed by Sakałowski were preserved. The government stated that it had decided to keep Sakałowski&#x27;s music in order to maintain historical continuity, and also on account of its popularity and musical quality. After the national anthem was adopted, the process of adopting national symbols was completed.

=== Reaction ===
The organization Freedom House commented on the adoption of the anthem in a report about the country, published in 2003. On page 125 of the &quot;Country Report of Belarus&quot;, Freedom House says that President Lukashenko has &quot;reintroduced the state symbols used by the old Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 2002, the president approved a streamlined version of the Soviet-era anthem &quot;&quot;, as the country&#x27;s new national anthem.&quot; The report also mentioned President Lukashenko&#x27;s ban of the symbols that were used since Belarus&#x27;s independence in 1991, such as the Pahonia arms and the white-red-white flag, which Lukashenko claims are associated with fascism (due to pro-Nazi Belarusian Central Rada usage during World War II). In 2003, Dr. Taras Kuzio wrote in Radio Free Europe that President Lukashenko &quot;is the quintessential Soviet Belarusian patriot who presides over a regime steeped in Soviet nostalgia.&quot; Kuzio said that the motives of Russia and Belarus in re-adopting Soviet-era symbols are part of restoring that nostalgia.

== Usage and regulations ==
The anthem must be performed in accordance with the lyrics and sheet music established by law. Each day, all national free to air radio stations and television networks across the country are required to play it twice; at 06:00 when going on air and again at 00:00 upon going off air. The anthem can also be performed on certain occasions, such as at government meetings, before sporting events and presidential inaugurations. While the anthem is being performed, citizens are required to stand at attention and those in military or police uniform must to be in Full Russian-style hand salute (if not in formation).

== National anthem proposals ==
===&quot;Vajacki Marš&quot;===

&quot;Vajacki Marš&quot; (&#x27;Warrior March&#x27;) was the official anthem of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, a Belarusian state that was created in 1918 but lasted only 10 months, during World War I.

Since 1919, the song has been used as an anthem of Belarus by the Belarusian diaspora in Western Europe and North America, as well as in countries like Australia and Brazil. It is still considered the official anthem used by the government-in-exile of the Belarusian Democratic Republic.

===&quot;Mahutny Boža&quot;===

&quot;Mahutny Boža&quot; (&#x27;Almighty God&#x27;), a religious hymn, is also actively used by those who oppose the Lukashenko regime.

===&quot;Pahonia&quot;===
The song &quot;Pahonia&quot;, based on the poem by Maksim Bahdanovič and set to music by Mikałaj Ščahłow-Kulikovič, has been performed &quot;a capella&quot; during the 2020 Belarusian protests and experienced a resurged popularity following them.

===&quot;Małaja Biełaruś&quot;===
A favourite in the anthem competition was the poem called &quot;Małaja Biełaruś&quot; (&#x27;Young Belarus&#x27;) by Janka Kupała. However, the poem was never set to a musical composition, so it could not be selected as the anthem.

=== &quot;Žyvie Biełaruś!&quot; ===
The anthem &quot;Žyvie Biełaruś!&quot; (&#x27;Long Live Belarus!&#x27;), with lyrics by Uładzimir Niaklajew and music by Vasil Rainčyk, won a 1992 non-binding contest and was occasionally used afterwards. For the 2002 contest, a revised version with the title &quot;Krasuj, Biełaruś&quot; (&#x27;Flourish, Belarus!&#x27;) was submitted, coming first in the vote with more than 37,300 votes. However, the commission selected the later-adopted version, which came in third, claiming that it and the other two lower-placed songs, which all shared the BSSR anthem&#x27;s melody, were selected by the total majority of voters (50,271 out of a total of 113,254).

==Lyrics==
The first verse and chorus are the most commonly performed parts of the anthem played during official ceremonies.

<doc id="250528" wikidata="Q2628621" url="?curid=250528" title="Dymaxion car">
<text>The Dymaxion car was designed by American inventor Buckminster Fuller during the Great Depression and featured prominently at Chicago&#x27;s 1933/1934 World&#x27;s Fair. Fuller built three experimental prototypes with naval architect Starling Burgess – using donated money as well as a family inheritance – to explore not an automobile per se, but the &#x27;ground-taxiing phase&#x27; of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive – an &quot;Omni-Medium Transport&quot;. Fuller associated the word &quot;Dymaxion&quot; with much of his work, a portmanteau of the words dynamic&quot;, maximum&quot;, and &quot;tension&quot;, to summarize his goal to do more with less.

The Dymaxion&#x27;s aerodynamic bodywork was designed for increased fuel efficiency and top speed, and its platform featured a lightweight hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-wheel drive (a rare &quot;RF&quot; layout), and three wheels. With steering via its third wheel at the rear (capable of 90° steering lock), the vehicle could steer itself in a tight circle, often causing a sensation. Fuller noted severe limitations in its handling, especially at high speed or in high wind, due to its rear-wheel steering (highly unsuitable for anything but low speeds) and the limited understanding of the effects of lift and turbulence on automobile bodies in that era – allowing only trained staff to drive the car and saying it &quot;was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements.&quot; Shortly after its launch, a prototype crashed and killed the Dymaxion&#x27;s driver. 

Despite courting publicity and the interest of auto manufacturers, Fuller used his inheritance to finish the second and third prototypes, selling all three, dissolving &quot;Dymaxion Corporation&quot; and reiterating that the Dymaxion was never intended as a commercial venture. One of the three original prototypes survives, and two semi-faithful replicas have recently been constructed. The Dymaxion was included in the 2009 book &quot;Fifty Cars That Changed The World&quot; and was the subject of the 2012 documentary &quot;The Last Dymaxion&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Fuller &quot;saw the Dymaxion, as he saw much of the world, as a kind of provisional prototype, a mere sketch, of the glorious, eventual future.&quot;

==History==
Fuller would ultimately go on to fully develop his &quot;Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science&quot;, his theory of using all technology on behalf of all people as soon as possible, but by this point it was &quot;his job, Fuller decided, to identify a problem, develop a way to solve it, and wait – perhaps as long as twenty-five years – for public awareness to catch up.

In 1930, Fuller had purchased an architectural magazine, &quot;T-Square&quot;, which he ultimately renamed &quot;Shelter.&quot; Fuller edited the magazine anonymously for two years, and in 1928 published sketches of his land-air-water vehicle, called a &quot;4D Transport&quot;. &quot;4D&quot; stood for Four Dimensional, a term used in physics and mathematics, referring to length, width, depth and time.

Regarding the 4D transport, author Lloyd S. Sieden, wrote in his 2000 book &quot;Bucky Fuller&#x27;s Universe&quot;:

To his daughter, Allegra, he described the Dymaxion as: 
Fuller was offered $5,000 (2023: $119,500) from wealthy former stock trader and socialite Philip (variously reported as &quot;Phillip&quot;) Pearson and his wife Temple Pearson (niece of Isadora Duncan) of Philadelphia. Pearson was a stock broker and had presciently sold short a large quantity of stock before the Great Depression, becoming instantly wealthy. Pearson had known of Fuller&#x27;s studies, had more wealth than he needed, and felt he could put Fuller and others to work in a way that would also do something to alleviate unemployment.

Fuller initially refused his benefactor, concerned about potential profit motives and short-sightedness. Fuller devised a contract, famously adding a so-called &quot;ice cream soda clause&quot; where Fuller could freely buy only ice cream sodas with all the donated money, should he so choose.

On March 4, 1933 – as President Roosevelt instituted a banking moratorium, Fuller formed &quot;Dymaxion Corporation&quot;, set up a workshop in the former dynamometer building of the defunct Locomobile Company at Tongue Point, on the west side of the harbor in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and hired naval architect Starling Burgess and a team of 27 workmen, including former Rolls-Royce mechanics. 1000 workmen had applied for the 27 jobs. The first of three prototypes was completed in three months – on Fuller&#x27;s 38th birthday, July 12, 1933.

On October 18, 1933, Fuller filed a patent, which was granted in 1937.

*&quot;Dymaxion Corporation&quot; location: ) 
*Note: Blueprints of the Dymaxion carried the name of the company as the &quot;4D Company,&quot;Signage on the Tongue Pointe, former Locomobile building read &quot;4D Dymaxion.&quot;

==Design==
Because Fuller was aiming for what he called &quot;Omni Medium Transport,&quot; a vehicle that could go anywhere, the Dymaxion would ultimately have &quot;wheels for ground travel and jet stilts for instant takeoff and flight.&quot; Jet stilts were Fuller&#x27;s placeholder idea for a future technology that could provide compact, concentrated lift — twenty years before the commercial availability of jets.

Estimating that designing a land–sea–air vehicle was then financially and technically out of reach, Fuller focused on the most dangerous and challenging mode of such vehicle: landing and taxiing on hard ground.

Fuller favored front-wheel drive, studying the way a wheelbarrow could more effectively pull its load rather than pitch forward when pushing a load. He began studies of the relationships between vehicles (cars, trucks – and also birds and fish) with the media in which they operated (fluid dynamics) – as well as steering mechanisms in nature, especially the rear &quot;single fin&quot; steering of birds and fish. Burgess, inventor of the first delta-wing aircraft, was invaluable to the project – but skeptical the vehicle would ever fly.

Fuller theorized that getting a long, aerodynamic &#x27;plane&#x27; fuselage – which was also inclined to have trailing, rear steering – to land safely and not immediately turn into the wind, would be a major challenge. The vehicle would inherently exhibit something he called &quot;ground-loopiness,&quot; and chose to focus his energy there. Although it was never intended as such, Fuller anticipated the public would instinctively call such a vehicle an &quot;automobile&quot;, and when licensing to drive the vehicle on Connecticut roads, acquiesced and applied for an automobile registration.

Fuller had worked with sculptor Isamu Noguchi to create plaster wind tunnel models of the Dymaxion to help determine its teardrop shape. Authors of a 2011 detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis at Coventry University of the Dymaxion bodywork noted the form&#x27;s &quot;similarity in shape to a humpback whale&quot; and concluded &quot;the Dymaxion car looks close to a drag optimum style and serves as a useful reference for low drag forms.&quot;

==Prototypes One, Two and Three==

*&quot;Prototype One&quot;, at long, was built on a hinged two-frame chassis constructed of lightweight chromoly steel with aircraft-type dished lightening holes – and powered by a Ford V8 engine producing in a rear-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. The front axle was a re-purposed and inverted (the flipped axle must be inverted to prevent the pinion gears from running the wrong way) rear axle from a contemporary Ford roadster. Tires were provided by Goodyear. The suspension used leaf springs &quot;turned sideways&quot; (transverse leaf springs) and bodywork featured sheet aluminum over an ash wood frame, with a roof partially constructed of snap-on painted canvas. Original blueprints indicate seating for four, including the driver. Fuller said he had achieved fuel economy of 36 mpg (7.8L/100 km) and to have reached a speed of .
*&quot;Prototypes Two&quot; and &quot;Three&quot; featured developmental improvements including a lighter three-frame chassis central periscope providing rearward vision, larger side windows, recessed headlights and a roof-mounted stabilizer with rear-facing exhaust outlet.
:&quot;Videos:&quot; In contemporary videos (see External links, below), Fuller is seen driving the vehicle at high speed. Another shows Fuller showing off his speeding ticket, demonstrating its ability to turn &quot;on itself&quot;, easily parallel parking in a space only six inches longer than the car, remarking that he averaged over 22 mpg (up to 30 mpg), and commenting on its stability, with a center of gravity both low and ahead of the midpoint of its wheelbase.

==Later prototype history==

*&quot;Prototype One&quot; was badly damaged in the noted car crash at the time of the 1933 Chicago Century of Progress fair. The car was repaired and sold to the director of the automotive division of the U.S. Bureau of Standards (BoS), only to be subsequently destroyed in a fire at the Washington D.C. garage of the BoS.

*&quot;Prototype Two&quot; survives in the Harrah Collection of the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. Prototype Two was initially purchased by Alfred Williams, manager of the Gulf Refining Company and driven cross country in a nationwide advertising promotion of aircraft fuel. In a contemporary video (see External links, below), Fuller notes that good friend Amelia Earhart asked that the Dymaxion be her official car for the celebration of her receiving the National Gold Medal from &quot;National Geographic&quot;. Dymaxion Prototype Two was driven to Washington and garnered considerable publicity.
*&quot;Prototype Three&quot; changed hands many times but was lost, presumed scrapped, in the 1950s. Once owned by Leopold Stokowski, it was estimated to have been driven 300,000 miles.

In 1934, Noguchi drove a completed Dymaxion on an extended road trip through Connecticut with Clare Boothe Luce and Dorothy Hale, stopping to see Thornton Wilder in Hamden, Connecticut, before driving to Hartford for the out-of-town opening of Gertrude Stein&#x27;s and Virgil Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;.

One of the prototypes was driven extensively in a campaign to raise funds in support of the Allies in WW II.

==Handling limitations==
Fuller and Burgess realized early that the Dymaxion concept would present considerable challenges. As anticipated, and in line with the purpose of the exploration, maneuvering in high winds proved problematic, with the vehicle having a strong tendency to turn into the wind. Steering difficulty and lift at the rear of the vehicle were also observed.

Fuller realized the Dymaxion &quot;was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements,&quot; and instituted a program of constant refinement and improvement to the platform.

Because of its limitations, Fuller and Burgess limited driving to a list of trained drivers and restricted use in high winds or inclement weather.

==Speed record==
Soon after launching &quot;Prototype One&quot;, Fuller was invited to exhibit the Dymaxion at a Bronx race track, beating the track record by 50% and drawing attention because it did not slide or drift across the track like the other race cars.

==Crashes==
A highly publicized crash in &quot;Prototype One&quot; on October 27, 1933, occurred &quot;virtually at the entrance to the Chicago Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair.&quot; The Dymaxion rolled over during the crash, killing its driver, Gulf employee Francis T. Turner, and seriously injuring its passengers: aviation pioneer (and noted spy) William Sempill and Charles Dollfuss, curator of France&#x27;s first air museum. 

The cause of the crash is disputed. A coroner&#x27;s inquest did not ascribe fault for the accident, stating that it involved a collision with a car driven by a shoe salesman named Meyer Roth (Fuller erroneously identified Roth as a highly placed Chicago Parks commissioner). When Fuller learned that another car was involved, he placed the blame for the incident entirely on Roth. Eyewitnesses, however, stated that Roth&#x27;s vehicle struck the Dymaxion only after it had begun to roll over. 

Fuller, who was not present at the accident, provided his version of events in a book he wrote in collaboration with Robert Marks on the Dymaxion; this account was repeated in Lloyd Steven Sieden&#x27;s book on Fuller. They stated that the two vehicles were traveling at 70 mph, with Turner trying to evade the politician&#x27;s car. The inquest showed, they argued, that the design of the Dymaxion was not a factor in the crash. The politician&#x27;s car, they further claimed, was quickly and illegally removed from the scene of the crash before reporters arrived. Turner was wearing a seatbelt but was killed when the canvas-covered roof framing collapsed. Dollfuss was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected and landed nearby on his feet. Sempill was severely injured and took months to recover before he could testify at the subsequent inquest. The Dymaxion itself had rolled over and was badly damaged but was subsequently repaired by Fuller and Burgess.

In the press, no mention was made that the Dymaxion had been involved in a two-car crash. Instead, the cause of the crash was attributed to the car&#x27;s unconventional configuration: headlines in New York and Chicago read, &quot;Freak car rolls over – killing famous driver – injuring international passengers&quot;.

Fuller himself would later crash &quot;Prototype Two&quot;, with his only surviving daughter, Allegra (Allegra Fuller Snyder), aboard.

==Auto industry==
Fuller received interest from Walter Chrysler, Henry Ford, and Henry Kaiser as well as companies including Packard, Studebaker and Curtiss-Wright.

Chrysler said Fuller had &quot;produced exactly the car [he, himself, had] always wanted to produce&quot;, when his company had set out to design a highly advanced, aerodynamic car, the Airflow, which Walter Chrysler ultimately found inferior. Chrysler commissioned Fuller to study the development of the Airflow, finding that Fuller had used one quarter the money and a third the time to make his prototype.

At various points, it appeared that several manufacturers were interested in marketing the Dymaxion. Walter Chrysler was interested, although he advised Fuller that such an advanced design would meet considerable resistance, and would make every used car on the road obsolete, threatening the wholesale dealer distribution and finance network. In his 1988 book, &quot;The Age of Heretics&quot;, author Art Kleiner said bankers had threatened to recall their loans, feeling the car would destroy sales for second-hand cars and for vehicles already in distribution channels.

==Replicas==

Hemmings Motor News cites two &quot;faithful or semi-faithful&quot; replicas:

*&quot;The Foster Dymaxion Replica&quot; was built in October 2010, by architect and student of Buckminster Fuller, Sir Norman Foster. Foster&#x27;s team conducted extensive research to replicate its interior, which had completely deteriorated on the only surviving prototype and had not been well documented. Foster was able to borrow Prototype Two under the condition he would also restore its interior. Prototype Two was shipped to the U.K. in order for the work to be carried out before returning to the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. 
*&quot;The Lane Dymaxion Replica&quot; was commissioned by the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, and built by craftsmen in Pennsylvania (chassis) and the Czech Republic (bodywork). After driving the Lane replica in 2015, automotive journalists Jamie Kitman and Dan Neil described it as having very poor stability and vehicle control.

<doc id="250531" wikidata="Q549344" url="?curid=250531" title="Mr. Potato Head">
<text>Mr. Potato Head is an American toy produced by Hasbro since 1952. It consists of a plastic model of a potato &quot;head&quot; to which a variety of plastic parts can attach; typically ears, eyes, shoes, hat, nose, mustache, pipe (1952–1987), pants (1973–1983, 2010–present), headphones (2024–present), glasses, and mouth.

Mr. Potato Head was invented and manufactured by George Lerner in 1949, but was first distributed by Hasbro in 1952. It was the first toy advertised on television and has remained in production since.

In its original form, Mr. Potato Head was offered as separate plastic parts with pushpins to be affixed to a real potato or other vegetable. Due to complaints regarding rotting vegetables and new government safety regulations, Hasbro began including a plastic potato body with the toy set in 1964. The original toy was joined by Mrs. Potato Head in 1953 and later supplemented with accessories including a car and boat trailer.

Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head both appeared in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, voiced by Don Rickles and Estelle Harris, respectively. Additionally, in 1998, &quot;The Mr. Potato Head Show&quot; aired but was short-lived, with only one season being produced. As one of the prominent marks of Hasbro, a Mr. Potato Head balloon has also joined others in the annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Toy Story Midway Mania!, in Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort, also features a large talking Mr. Potato Head.

Hasbro updated the brand in 2021, dropping the honorific in the name and marketing the toy simply as Potato Head, while retaining the individual characters of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head.

==History==
In the early 1940s, Brooklyn-born toy inventor George Lerner came up with the idea of inserting small, pronged body and face parts into fruits and vegetables to create a &quot;funny face man&quot;. The exact origin and inspiration for this idea are unknown. One theory is that, as a child, Lerner often took potatoes from his mother&#x27;s garden and, using various other fruits and vegetables as facial features, made dolls for his younger sisters. In a slight variation of this story, the items he attached to the potatoes were smaller fruits and vegetables (e.g., grapes for eyes and carrots for noses). However, others have speculated that he got the idea from his wife&#x27;s nephew Aaron Bradley, who was seen placing sticks inside of potatoes in the family garden. Yet another version states that Lerner came up with the idea in 1949 and was inspired by his own children, who often played with their food. Various sources list 1949 as the official year that the Funny Face Man was invented.

In 1951, Lerner completed a prototype for Funny Face Man. Finding a buyer was initially a challenge because companies thought consumers would be hesitant to waste food so soon after the rationing that was widespread during World War II. However, Post Cereals purchased the rights to Funny Face Man that same year, with plans to include the kits in breakfast cereal boxes. Just a few months later (in 1952), the toy company Hassenfeld Brothers (now known as Hasbro) and Lerner bought back the rights to Funny Face Man kits from Post. In Hasbro&#x27;s version, the kits included a styrofoam head. However, because the styrofoam head had limited reusability, the packaging still recommended that the accessories be affixed to potatoes or other produce. 

On April 30, 1952, Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised on television. The campaign was also the first to be aimed directly at children; before this, commercials were only targeted at adults, including toy advertisements. The commercial revolutionized marketing by focusing on children as a target audience and encouraging them to ask their parents to buy the product (a concept that came to be known as the &quot;nag factor&quot;). Additionally, between 1949 and 1952, television sales had increased exponentially, and a massive polio outbreak in 1952 resulted in children spending more time indoors. Over one million kits were sold in the first year. 

In 1953, Hasbro introduced a Mrs. Potato Head variant, and soon after, Brother Spud and Sister Yam completed the family, followed by accessories reflecting the affluence of the 1950s: a car, boat trailer, kitchen set, stroller, and pets marketed as &quot;Spud-ettes&quot;. In the 1960s, Hasbro also introduced the Tooty Frooty Friends kit, which came with over 60 pieces for building four additional characters: Katie the Carrot, Kooky the Cucumber, Oscar the Orange, and Pete the Pepper. 

Although the toys were originally produced as separate plastic parts to be attached to a real potato or other vegetable, in 1964, Hasbro began to include a separate plastic head and body in each box and made the attachments less sharp, leaving them unable to puncture vegetables easily. These changes were due, in part, to parental complaints about finding spoiled food in their homes, but there were also reports of children choking on the small pieces or cutting themselves with the sharp ends. In 1973, further changes were made to increase safety. To comply with the Child Protection Act of 1966 and the Child Protection and Toy Safety Act of 1969, Hasbro combined the head and body into one large piece and made the attachments larger to prevent choking. Arms were no longer included in the kits. Additionally, Hasbro replaced the holes with flat slots, allowing only one possible orientation for the attached parts. In 1983, Hasbro tweaked the Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head design by adding white bendable arms wearing white gloves. A storage compartment was also added to this larger head/body combination piece.

In 1985, Mr. Potato Head received four postal votes in the run for mayor of Boise, Idaho in the &quot;most votes for Mr. Potato Head in a political campaign&quot; as verified by Guinness World Records. In November 1987, Mr. Potato Head became &quot;Spokespud&quot; for the annual Great American Smokeout and surrendered his pipe to Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in Washington, D.C. In 1989, Hasbro replaced the attached bendable arms with the removable plastic arms.

In the 1990s, the League of Women Voters used Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head to promote a &quot;Get Out the Vote&quot; campaign. Additionally, Mr. Potato Head received an award from the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. The award was presented by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was chairman of the organization at that time.

In 1995, Mr. Potato Head was featured in a leading role in the Disney/Pixar animated feature &quot;Toy Story&quot;, with the voice provided by comedian Don Rickles. Mr. Potato Head later returned in Toy Story&#x27;s three sequels — &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010) and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019) — with Rickles reprising the role; however, Rickles died in April 2017 due to kidney failure, so Pixar used unused archival audio of his voice for the latter film. Also in 1995, the Mr. Potato Head Pals Mix &#x27;n&#x27; Match game was made. This box contained four bodies and four sets each of hands, eyes, noses, mouths, hats, and shoes. Aimed at young children, the goal of the game was to build characters to match the provided cards.

In 2000, Mr. Potato Head was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York. In 2006, Hasbro also began to sell sets of pieces without bodies for customers to add to their collections. Some of these themed sets included Chef, Construction Worker, Firefighter, Halloween, King, Mermaid, Police Officer, Pirate, Princess, Rockstar, and Santa Claus. In the same year, Hasbro introduced a line called &quot;Sports Spuds&quot; with a generic plastic potato (smaller than the standard size) customized to a wide variety of professional sports teams.

In 2010, Hasbro received a Toy &amp; Game Innovation Award from Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry. In the same year, Hasbro tweaked the Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head body design to give it a slimmer appearance, commonly referred to as &quot;Active Adventures&quot;. As of 2012, sales of Mr. Potato Head and related products were reported to have exceeded 100 million units since the original release. 

On February 25, 2021, Hasbro dropped the honorific in the brand name and began marketing the toy simply as &quot;Potato Head&quot;, while retaining the individual characters of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. However, several media outlets misinterpreted the announcement as stating that all Potato Head products would henceforth be gender neutral. While continuing to offer the classic Mr. and Mrs. characters, Hasbro was praised by some for being progressive, although others called it a &quot;PR stunt&quot;.

Since 2024, new models of the Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head toys have been produced.

==Versions==
In 1995, to celebrate the release of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Hasbro produced the first licensed Mr. Potato Head which used pieces from the 1987 Bucket of Parts (a black derby hat, an orange nose, a long mustache, pink ears, a tall set of eyes, and blue sneakers) to replicate his look from the film.

In the 2000s, Hasbro has produced Mr. Potato Head sets based on several media properties that Hasbro produces toys for under license. These include the &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed &quot;Darth Tater&quot;, &quot;Spud Trooper&quot;, and &quot;R2-POTATOO&quot;, a 2007 &quot;Transformers&quot; film-themed &quot;Optimash Prime&quot; (the appearance is based on Optimus Prime from the original television series), a pair of Spider-Man-themed &quot;Spider-Spud / Peter Tater&quot; (both red suit and black suit, to tie in with &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;), an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-themed &quot;Taters of the Lost Ark&quot; set (which, despite the title, was released as a tie-in to 2008&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;), an &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;-themed &quot;Tony Starch&quot;, and a &quot;Trick or Tater&quot; version for Halloween in October 2008. An additional five &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed potato heads were sold exclusively through Disney theme parks: &quot;Luke Frywalker&quot;, &quot;Yam Solo&quot;, &quot;Spuda Fett&quot;, &quot;Princess Tater&quot;, and &quot;Darth Mash&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Bumble Spud&quot; was produced based on &quot;&quot;. A Kiss version of Mr. Potato Head was produced recently. Disney, in cooperation with Hasbro, also released &quot;Chipbacca&quot;, &quot;Mashter Yoda&quot;, and &quot;C-3PotatO&quot; in October 2009 at Disney Parks. To celebrate &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, five new Mr. Potato Heads were unveiled including &quot;Woody&#x27;s Tater Roundup&quot;, &quot;Spud Lightyear&quot;, &quot;Jessie the Spud-slinging Cowgirl&quot;, and the classic Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. To promote &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, Hasbro unveiled Bugs Bunny-, Daffy Duck-, and Tasmanian Devil-themed Mr. Potato Head dolls.

In 2011, it was announced at the New York Toy Fair that a second Elvis Mr. Potato Head (based on his 1968 TV special) would be released, as well as sets for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Lion), the Three Stooges, &quot;Star Trek&quot; (Kirk and Kor), and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. These were all released through PPW Toys from Hasbro.

In 2012, Hasbro and PPW Toys released Mr. Potato Head in Batman form for the movie &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. The model, known as &quot;The Dark Spud&quot;, features Mr. Potato Head dressed up as the Caped Crusader. Before the release, the model was unveiled at the 2012 New York Toy Fair. In 2014, to celebrate &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ 25th anniversary, PPW Toys produced a Homer Simpson-themed Mr. Potato Head.

On April Fools Day 2019, Hasbro jokingly announced that Mr. Potato Head would be replaced by &quot;Mr. Avo Head&quot;, a hipster avocado.

To celebrate the release of &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, Hasbro produced new &quot;Toy Story&quot; versions of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. These versions feature the &quot;Active Adventures&quot; model of the bodies and ears with a mix of various parts, including the classic versions of the arms and shoes, film-accurate facial features and the newer designs of the parts. Hasbro also produced new &quot;Active Adventures&quot; versions of &quot;Woody&#x27;s Tater Roundup&quot; and &quot;Spud Lightyear&quot;.

In 2020, Hasbro announced a sustainable version of the toy known as &quot;Mr. Potato Head Goes Green&quot;. This version was made from plant-based plastic derived from sugarcane.

To celebrate Mr. Potato Head&#x27;s 70th anniversary in 2022, Hasbro produced elderly versions of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head.

==In popular culture==

Mr. Potato Head&#x27;s popularity has led to some appearances in films and television. From 1986 to 1987, Mr. Potato Head played a supporting role in the short-lived syndicated series &quot;Potato Head Kids&quot;, his first dramatic television appearance. From 1998 to 1999, he had his own short-lived Fox Kids series &quot;The Mr. Potato Head Show&quot;.

In addition to film and television, the character has been the subject of a comic strip created by Garfield creator Jim Davis. Cartoonist Gary Larson included the character in several of his &quot;The Far Side&quot; cartoons. 

In a commercial for Bridgestone tires during Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, Mr. Potato Head is driving a car and Mrs. Potato Head is nagging him.
Larger-than-life versions of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are &quot;guests&quot; in the 1980s section of Pop Century Resort at Walt Disney World in Florida.

In 1990, the sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot; parodied the toy and entertainer Michael Jackson and his penchant for plastic surgery in a skit called &quot;The Michael Jackson Potato Head Kit&quot;, offering children a multitude of different noses to represent different stages in Jackson&#x27;s career. Jackson&#x27;s vitiligo was also mocked when one child said the toy did not look quite right and his father peels it, revealing white skin underneath.

The toy helped inspire the classic Macintosh software toy Tuberling by John Calhoun of Soft Dorothy Software, which was later reimplemented for the K Desktop Environment as KTuberling.

Starting in the 2000s, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head also starred in commercials for other brands. An example is an ad for Lay&#x27;s in 2014 where the &quot;Active Adventures&quot; Mr. Potato Head comes home to see the &quot;Active Adventures&quot; Mrs. Potato Head eating them despite being a potato herself.

Mr. Potato Head is also a character in the Disney/Pixar &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, voiced by Don Rickles. He was one of Andy&#x27;s toys before being given to Bonnie in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;.

In &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), Mr. Potato Head is shown to be moody towards Andy&#x27;s other toys, though he is friends with Hamm the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger). When Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) accidentally pushes Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) out of a window, Potato Head accuses Woody of doing it on purpose. At the end of the film, he is overjoyed to hear Andy&#x27;s sister Molly getting a Mrs. Potato Head on Christmas.

In &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), Mr. Potato Head goes with Andy&#x27;s other toys to rescue Woody, who has been stolen by Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight). After Mr. Potato Head saves three Alien toys (Jeff Pidgeon) from falling out of a Pizza Planet truck, only for them to continually pester him, his wife Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) decides to adopt them, much to her husband&#x27;s dismay.

In &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), Mr. Potato Head is one of Andy&#x27;s remaining toys, alongside his wife, the Aliens, and others. The toys are donated to a daycare center and are later almost killed in a landfill incinerator. When the Aliens rescue the toys with a giant crane, Mr. Potato Head finally accepts them as his sons. Eventually, Mr. Potato Head and his friends are donated to a new owner named Bonnie (Emily Hahn).

Mr. Potato Head has appeared in all three &quot;Toy Story Toons&quot; shorts: &quot;Hawaiian Vacation&quot; (2011), &quot;Small Fry&quot; (2011), and &quot;Partysaurus Rex&quot; (2012), voiced again by Don Rickles.

He also appeared in the Halloween special &quot;Toy Story of Terror!&quot; (2013), where he disappears and Bonnie&#x27;s other toys must find him.

Mr. Potato Head appeared in the Christmas special, &quot;Toy Story That Time Forgot&quot; (2014).

Mr. Potato Head appeared in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019). However, Rickles died in 2017 due to kidney failure, and did not record any lines for him for the film. With permission from Rickles&#x27;s family, Pixar used unreleased lines that Rickles recorded in previous &quot;Toy Story&quot; films for his final performance as the character. Mr. Potato Head had 7 lines in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, which was dedicated to Rickles&#x27;s memory. Mr. Potato Head first appears in the prologue of the movie. Later during the main events of the film, he and his wife join Bonnie and her parents on their RV road trip. At the end of the film, they say goodbye to Woody who chooses to stay with Bo Peep (Annie Potts).

Mr. Potato Head is seen dancing in a Pixar Popcorn short called To Fitness and Beyond.

==Games==
On November 13, 1995, a computer game called &quot;Mr. Potato Head Saves Veggie Valley&quot; was released by Hasbro Interactive.

In 1997, Hasbro Interactive released another game called &quot;Mr. Potato Head&#x27;s Activity Pack&quot;.

Mr. Potato Head has also appeared as the host in all installments of the popular video game series &quot;Hasbro Family Game Night&quot;. He also appeared in several &quot;Toy Story&quot;-based video games along with &quot;Toy Story&quot; Activity Center.

<doc id="250535" wikidata="Q5871123" url="?curid=250535" title="History of zoology through 1859">
<text>The history of zoology before Charles Darwin&#x27;s 1859 theory of evolution traces the organized study of the animal kingdom from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of &quot;zoology&quot; as a single coherent field arose much later, systematic study of zoology is seen in the works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. This work was developed in the Middle Ages by Islamic medicine and scholarship, and in turn their work was extended by European scholars such as Albertus Magnus.

During the European Renaissance and early modern period, zoological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were the anatomist Vesalius and the physiologist William Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation, and naturalists such as Carl Linnaeus and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. Microscopy revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. The growing importance of natural theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the argument from design).

Over the 18th and 19th centuries, zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided observational evidence that it had done so.

==Pre-scientific zoology==
The earliest humans must have had and passed on knowledge about animals to increase their chances of survival. This may have included unsystematic knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). People learnt more about animals with the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Humans domesticated animals as people became pastoralists and then farmers instead of hunter-gatherers in civilisations such as those of ancient Egypt. 

===Ancient eastern cultures===
The ancient cultures of Mesopotamia, the Indian subcontinent, and China, among others, produced renowned surgeons and students of the natural sciences such as Susruta and Zhang Zhongjing, reflecting independent sophisticated systems of natural philosophy. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BC, expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments. The ancient Indian Ayurveda tradition independently developed the concept of three humours, resembling that of the four humours of ancient Greek medicine, though the Ayurvedic system included further complications, such as the body being composed of five elements and seven basic tissues. Ayurvedic writers also classified living things into four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb, eggs, heat &amp; moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of a fetus in detail. They also made considerable advances in the field of surgery, often without the use of human dissection or animal vivisection. One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC. It was also an early materia medica, describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources. However, the roots of modern zoology are usually traced back to the secular tradition of ancient Greek philosophy.

===Ancient Greek traditions===

The pre-Socratic philosophers asked many questions about life but produced little systematic knowledge of specifically zoological interest—though the attempts of the atomists to explain life in purely physical terms would recur periodically through the history of zoology. However, the medical theories of Hippocrates and his followers, especially humorism, had a lasting impact.

==Aristotelian zoology==
===Aristotle===

The philosopher Aristotle created the science of biology, basing its theory on both his metaphysical principles and on observation. He proposed theories for the processes of metabolism, temperature regulation, information processing, embryonic development and inheritance. He made detailed observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of animals in the sea at Lesbos. He classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50.

Aristotle, and nearly all Western scholars after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the &quot;scala naturae&quot; or Great Chain of Being.

===Hellenistic zoology===

A few scholars in the Hellenistic period under the Ptolemies—particularly Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Chios—amended Aristotle&#x27;s physiological work, even performing experimental dissections and vivisections. Claudius Galen became the most important authority on medicine and anatomy. Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological Aristotelian viewpoint that all aspects of life are the result of design or purpose, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) remained central to biological thought until the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Medieval and Islamic zoology===
The decline of the Roman Empire led to the disappearance or destruction of much knowledge, though physicians still incorporated many aspects of the Aristotelian tradition into training and practice. In Byzantium and the Islamic world, many of Aristotle&#x27;s works were translated into Arabic and commented upon by scholars such as Avicenna and Averroes.
Medieval Muslim physicians, scientists and philosophers made significant contributions to zoological knowledge between the 8th and 13th centuries during the Islamic Golden Age. The Arab scholar al-Jahiz (781–869) described the idea of a food chain, and was an early adherent of environmental determinism.

During the High Middle Ages, a few European scholars such as Hildegard of Bingen, Albertus Magnus and Frederick II expanded the natural history canon. Magnus&#x27;s &quot;De animalibus libri XXVI&quot; was one of the most extensive studies of zoological observation published before modern times.

==Renaissance and early modern ==

===From anatomy to systematic taxonomy===

The Renaissance was the age of collectors and travellers, when many of the stories were actually demonstrated as true when the living or preserved specimens were brought to Europe. Verification by collecting of things, instead of the accumulation of anecdotes, then became more common, and scholars developed a new faculty of careful observation. The Renaissance brought expanded interest in both empirical natural history and physiology. In 1543, Andreas Vesalius inaugurated the modern era of Western medicine with his seminal human anatomy treatise &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;, which was based on dissection of corpses. Vesalius was the first in a series of anatomists who gradually replaced scholasticism with empiricism in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience rather than authority and abstract reasoning. Bestiaries—a genre that combines both the natural and figurative knowledge of animals—also became more sophisticated. Conrad Gessner&#x27;s great zoological work, &quot;Historiae animalium&quot;, appeared in four volumes, 1551–1558, at Zürich, a fifth being issued in 1587. His works were the starting-point of modern zoology. Other major works were produced by William Turner, Pierre Belon, Guillaume Rondelet, and Ulisse Aldrovandi. Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often working with naturalists, were also interested in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing to the growth of anatomical knowledge.

In the 17th century, the enthusiasts of the new sciences, the investigators of nature by means of observation and experiment, banded themselves into academies or societies for mutual support and discourse. The first founded of surviving European academies, the Academia Naturae Curiosorum (1651) especially confined itself to the description and illustration of the structure of plants and animals; eleven years later (1662) the Royal Society of London was incorporated by royal charter, having existed without a name or fixed organisation for seventeen years previously (from 1645). A little later the Academy of Sciences of Paris was established by Louis XIV, later still the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala was founded. Systematizing, naming and classifying dominated zoology throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. While Linnaeus conceived of species as unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, the other great naturalist of the 18th century, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was writing in an era before evolution was recognized, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his &quot;transformist&quot; theory would influence the evolutionary theories of both Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin.

Before the Age of Exploration, naturalists had little idea of the sheer scale of biological diversity. The discovery and description of new species and the collection of specimens became a passion of scientific gentlemen and a lucrative enterprise for entrepreneurs; many naturalists traveled the globe in search of scientific knowledge and adventure.

Extending the work of Vesalius into experiments on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), William Harvey investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries. Harvey&#x27;s &quot;De motu cordis&quot; in 1628 was the beginning of the end for Galenic theory, and alongside Santorio Santorio&#x27;s studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.

===Impact of the microscope===
In the early 17th century, the micro-world of zoology was just beginning to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude microscopes since the late 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal &quot;Micrographia&quot; based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until Antony van Leeuwenhoek&#x27;s dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.

Debate over the flood described in the Bible catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno&#x27;s ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists until the end of the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and extinction.
Advances in microscopy also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.

==In advance of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;==
Up through the 19th century, the scope of zoology was largely divided between physiology, which investigated questions of form and function, and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology. Widespread travel by naturalists in the early-to-mid-19th century resulted in a wealth of new information about the diversity and distribution of living organisms. Of particular importance was the work of Alexander von Humboldt, which analyzed the relationship between organisms and their environment (i.e., the domain of natural history) using the quantitative approaches of natural philosophy (i.e., physics and chemistry). Humboldt&#x27;s work laid the foundations of biogeography and inspired several generations of scientists.

The emerging discipline of geology also brought natural history and natural philosophy closer together; Georges Cuvier and others made great strides in comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct—rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed. Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, Mary Anning, and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an &#x27;age of reptiles&#x27; that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth.

Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus&#x27;s writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions. Charles Darwin&#x27;s early interest in nature led him on a five-year voyage on which established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell&#x27;s uniformitarian ideas, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author. Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the transmutation of species and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories.
Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, published on 24 November 1859, a seminal work of scientific literature, was to be the foundation of evolutionary biology.

<text>Protagonistas de Novela () is a television series in Spanish that has been produced since 2002 by Telemundo Network USA, based on the &quot;Protagonistas...&quot; franchise.

&quot;Protagonistas de Novela&quot; has the same format and rules as &quot;Protagonistas de la Música&quot;, and that is because &quot;Protagonistas de Novela&quot;, a reality show where the winners are guaranteed a spot in a future telenovela, was released before its musical version. Both shows are produced by Telemundo USA.

The female winner of the show&#x27;s first season, Millie Ruperto, has already participated in a soap opera, playing a boxing trainer, alongside Venezuelan superstar Gaby Spanic.

The winners of the show&#x27;s second season in 2003 were Mexican Erick Elías and Dominican Michelle Vargas.
This particular season was highly criticized for its results, since Elías won with an alleged 50.1% of the vote over the heavy favorite, Puerto Rican actor Alfredo De Quesada, who had 49.1% of the vote according to the show.

There are also versions of &quot;Protagonistas de Novela&quot; in Chile (called &quot;Protagonistas de la Fama&quot;), Colombia and Venezuela. In Chile (airing on Canal 13), the winners were Catalina Bono and Álvaro Ballero. In Colombia (airing on RCN), the winners were Ximena Córdoba and Jaider Villa.

<text>* Rhodopsin, also known as visual purple, is a protein encoded by the &quot;RHO&quot; gene and a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is a light-sensitive receptor protein that triggers visual phototransduction in rod cells. Rhodopsin mediates dim light vision and thus is extremely sensitive to light. When rhodopsin is exposed to light, it immediately photobleaches. In humans, it is fully regenerated in about 30 minutes, after which the rods are more sensitive. Defects in the rhodopsin gene cause eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness.

Rhodopsin was discovered by Franz Christian Boll in 1876. The name rhodopsin derives from Ancient Greek () for &quot;rose&quot;, due to its pinkish color, and () for &quot;sight&quot;. It was coined in 1878 by the German physiologist Wilhelm Friedrich Kühne (1837–1900).

When George Wald discovered that rhodopsin is a holoprotein, consisting of retinal and an apoprotein, he called it opsin, which today would be described more narrowly as apo-rhodopsin. Today, the term opsin refers more broadly to the class of G-protein-coupled receptors that bind retinal and as a result become a light-sensitive photoreceptor, including all closely related proteins. When Wald and colleagues later isolated iodopsin from chicken retinas, thereby discovering the first known cone opsin, they called apo-iodopsin &quot;photopsin&quot; (for its relation to photopic vision) and apo-rhodopsin &quot;scotopsin&quot; (for its use in scotopic vision).

== General ==
Rhodopsin is a protein found in the outer segment discs of rod cells. It mediates scotopic vision, which is &quot;monochromatic&quot; vision in dim light. Rhodopsin most strongly absorbs green-blue light (~500 nm) and appears therefore reddish-purple, hence the archaic term &quot;visual purple&quot;.

Several closely related opsins differ only in a few amino acids and in the wavelengths of light that they absorb most strongly. Humans have, including rhodopsin, nine opsins, as well as cryptochrome (light-sensitive, but not an opsin).

== Structure ==
Rhodopsin, like other opsins, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are chemoreceptors that embed in the lipid bilayer of the cell membranes and have seven transmembrane domains forming a binding pocket for a ligand. The ligand for rhodopsin is the vitamin A-based chromophore 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal, which lies horizontally to the cell membrane and is covalently bound to a lysine residue (lys296) in the seventh transmembrane domain through a Schiff-base. However, 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal only blocks the binding pocket and does not activate rhodopsin. It is only activated when 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal absorbs a photon of light and isomerizes to all-&quot;trans&quot;-retinal, the receptor activating form, causing conformal changes in rhodopsin (bleaching), which activate a phototransduction cascade. Thus, a chemoreceptor is converted to a light or photo(n)receptor.

The retinal binding lysine is conserved in almost all opsins, only a few opsins having lost it during evolution. Opsins without the lysine are not light sensitive, including rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is made constitutively (continuously) active by some of those mutations even without light. Also wild-type rhodopsin is constitutively active, if no 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal is bound, but much less. Therefore 11-&quot;cis&quot;-retinal is an inverse agonist. Such mutations are one cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Artificially, the retinal binding lysine can be shifted to other positions, even into other transmembrane domains, without changing the activity.

The rhodopsin of cattle has 348 amino acids, the retinal binding lysine being Lys296. It was the first opsin whose amino acid sequence and 3D-structure were determined. Its structure has been studied in detail by x-ray crystallography on rhodopsin crystals. Several models (e.g., the &quot;bicycle-pedal mechanism&quot;, &quot;hula-twist mechanism&quot;) attempt to explain how the retinal group can change its conformation without clashing with the enveloping rhodopsin protein pocket. Recent data support that rhodopsin is a functional monomer, instead of a dimer, which was the paradigm of G-protein-coupled receptors for many years.

Within its native membrane, rhodopsin is found at a high density facilitating its ability to capture photons. Due to its dense packing within the membrane, there is a higher chance of rhodopsin capturing photons. However, the high density also is a disadvantage when it comes to G protein signaling because the needed diffusion becomes more difficult in a crowded membrane that is packed with rhodopsin.

== Phototransduction ==

Rhodopsin is an essential G-protein coupled receptor in phototransduction.

=== Activation ===
In rhodopsin, the aldehyde group of retinal is covalently linked to the amino group of a lysine residue on the protein in a protonated Schiff base (-NH+=CH-). When rhodopsin absorbs light, its retinal cofactor isomerizes from the 11-cis to the all-trans configuration, and the protein subsequently undergoes a series of relaxations to accommodate the altered shape of the isomerized cofactor. The intermediates formed during this process were first investigated in the laboratory of George Wald, who received the Nobel prize for this research in 1967. The photoisomerization dynamics has been subsequently investigated with time-resolved IR spectroscopy and UV/Vis spectroscopy. A first photoproduct called photorhodopsin forms within 200 femtoseconds after irradiation, followed within picoseconds by a second one called bathorhodopsin with distorted all-trans bonds. This intermediate can be trapped and studied at cryogenic temperatures, and was initially referred to as prelumirhodopsin. In subsequent intermediates lumirhodopsin and metarhodopsin I, the Schiff&#x27;s base linkage to all-trans retinal remains protonated, and the protein retains its reddish color. The critical change that initiates the neuronal excitation involves the conversion of metarhodopsin I to metarhodopsin II, which is associated with deprotonation of the Schiff&#x27;s base and change in color from red to yellow.

=== Phototransduction cascade ===
The product of light activation, Metarhodopsin II, initiates the visual phototransduction second messenger pathway by stimulating the G-protein transducin (Gt), resulting in the liberation of its α subunit. This GTP-bound subunit in turn activates a cGMP phosphodiesterase. The cGMP phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes (breaks down) cGMP, lowering its local concentration so it can no longer activate cGMP-dependent cation channels. This leads to the hyperpolarization of photoreceptor cells, changing the rate at which they release transmitters.

=== Deactivation ===
Meta II (metarhodopsin II) is deactivated rapidly after activating transducin by rhodopsin kinase and arrestin. Rhodopsin pigment must be regenerated for further phototransduction to occur. This means replacing all-trans-retinal with 11-cis-retinal and the decay of Meta II is crucial in this process. During the decay of Meta II, the Schiff base link that normally holds all-trans-retinal and the apoprotein opsin (aporhodopsin) is hydrolyzed and becomes Meta III. In the rod outer segment, Meta III decays into separate all-trans-retinal and opsin. A second product of Meta II decay is an all-trans-retinal opsin complex in which the all-trans-retinal has been translocated to second binding sites. Whether the Meta II decay runs into Meta III or the all-trans-retinal opsin complex seems to depend on the pH of the reaction. Higher pH tends to drive the decay reaction towards Meta III.

== Diseases of the retina ==
Mutations in the rhodopsin gene contribute majorly to various diseases of the retina such as retinitis pigmentosa. In general, the defect rhodopsin aggregates with ubiquitin in inclusion bodies, disrupts the intermediate filament network, and impairs the ability of the cell to degrade non-functioning proteins, which leads to photoreceptor apoptosis. Other mutations on rhodopsin lead to X-linked congenital stationary night blindness, mainly due to constitutive activation, when the mutations occur around the chromophore binding pocket of rhodopsin. Several other pathological states relating to rhodopsin have been discovered including poor post-Golgi trafficking, dysregulative activation, rod outer segment instability and arrestin binding.
