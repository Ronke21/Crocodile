<text>Awake! is an illustrated religious magazine published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. It is considered to be a companion magazine of &quot;The Watchtower&quot;, and is distributed by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The Watch Tower Society reports a worldwide circulation of about 12.8 million copies per issue in 252 languages.
==History==

The magazine was originally published bimonthly from October 1, 1919, under the title The Golden Age. It was founded for use in the Bible Students&#x27; new door-to-door ministry, though the founder of the movement, Charles Taze Russell, had indicated in his will that the Watch Tower Society would not publish any periodicals other than &quot;The Watch Tower&quot;. Clayton J. Woodworth was editor of the magazine, and later went on to serve on the boards of several corporations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. On October 6, 1937, the magazine was renamed Consolation and continued to be published biweekly until July 31, 1946.

On August 22, 1946, the magazine was renamed &quot;Awake!&quot;, drawing its new title from Romans 13:11 (ASV): &quot;... it is time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s editorship then became anonymous. (Autobiographical articles credited to individual members about their experiences and circumstances occasionally appear.)
From 1982 to 1995, each issue of the magazine included a mission statement that stated: &quot;this magazine builds confidence in the Creator&#x27;s promise of a peaceful and secure new order before the generation that saw 1914 passes away&quot;. When Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; belief regarding the &quot;generation&quot; of 1914 was changed to a less literal sense, the aim was restated as, &quot;this magazine builds confidence in the Creator&#x27;s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is about to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things&quot;.

Until 2005, &quot;Awake!&quot; was published semimonthly in major languages (on the 8th and 22nd), monthly in many languages, and quarterly in a few languages. From January 2006, the magazine was published monthly. As of January 2016, it was published every two months and was further reduced to three issues per year as of January 2018. In 2022, publication was reduced to one new issue per year.

==Content==
&quot;The Golden Age&quot; outlined its primary aim in its first issue, stating, &quot;we will point the people to the clear and indisputable evidence in the light of present-day events, disclosing the divinely expressed remedy for the reconstruction of human affairs that will bring the desire of all nations, assuring to the people life, liberty, and happiness.&quot; The magazine also contained articles about &quot;social, political, and economic issue and was not confined to purely religious matters&quot;. Georges D. Chryssides notes that some articles &quot;were opposed to orthodox medicine&quot;, particularly against vaccinations, theories about germs and the use of aluminum cooking utensils, &quot;and recommended alternative methods of health care and remedies&quot;.

&quot;Awake!&quot; contains articles on general interest topics such as nature, geography, health, family life, and also the Bible and biblical history, and is overseen by the Writing Committee of the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Many issues claim that mankind is living in the end times.

==Distribution==
The magazine is printed in nineteen countries. &quot;Awake!&quot; has a worldwide circulation of 31,460,000 copies of each issue and is available, in selected languages, online in various digital formats.

The magazine is distributed by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the course of their public ministry including door-to-door canvassing, approaching people in public places, given informally to acquaintances and professionals, or left as reading material in waiting areas.

===Cost===
&quot;The Golden Age&quot; was initially available for $1.50 () per year on a subscription basis. Until March 1990, &quot;Awake!&quot; was available for a small charge that varied over time and in different countries. For example, in the United States, the suggested donation per issue was $0.05 in 1950, gradually increasing to $0.25 in 1989. On January 17, 1990, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Jimmy Swaggart that sales of religious literature were subject to taxation, which introduced ambiguity into the formerly tax-free practice of suggesting a particular donation in exchange for the magazines. The Watch Tower Society supported Swaggart in the case, arguing that the perceived sale of religious literature should be exempt from taxation.

From March 1, 1990, the magazines were made available at no cost, on a freewill donation basis in the United States, with the stated purpose of simplifying their Bible educational work and distinguishing themselves from those who commercialize religion. An article in the May 1990 issue of &quot;Our Kingdom Ministry&quot;—a newsletter provided to members—stated that &quot;there are growing pressures against all religious elements&quot; and went on to say that their main concern was to move ahead in the worldwide preaching work, &quot;without hindrance&quot;.

The sale of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; literature was gradually phased out in other countries, and &quot;Awake!&quot; has been distributed free of charge worldwide since early 2000, its printing being funded by voluntary donations from Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and members of the public.

<doc id="251226" wikidata="Q743165" url="?curid=251226" title="Kingdom Hall">
<text>A Kingdom Hall is a place of worship used by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The term was first suggested in 1935 by Joseph Franklin Rutherford, then president of the Watch Tower Society, for a building in Hawaii. Rutherford&#x27;s reasoning was that these buildings would be used for &quot;preaching the good news of the Kingdom&quot;. 

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses use Kingdom Halls for the majority of their worship and Bible instruction. Witnesses prefer the term &quot;Kingdom Hall&quot; over &quot;church&quot;, noting that the term often translated &quot;church&quot; in the Bible refers to the congregation of people rather than a structure.

== Location and presentation ==

Kingdom Halls are typically modest, functional structures with practicality in mind. As Witnesses do not use religious symbols, such are not displayed on or in Kingdom Halls. An annual yeartext, or &quot;theme scripture&quot;, which is the same for all congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses worldwide, is prominently displayed inside each Kingdom Hall. This text can be displayed in several languages if the Hall is used by foreign-language congregations. A Kingdom Hall typically has a library, contribution boxes, and a literature counter, where publications are displayed, stored and dispensed.

Some Kingdom Halls have multiple auditoriums to allow more than one congregation to conduct meetings simultaneously. Where there is more than one auditorium, each auditorium or the entire structure may be referred to as &quot;a Kingdom Hall&quot;. Larger &quot;Assembly Halls&quot; or &quot;Convention Centers of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;, or any rented arena or stadium used for larger gatherings of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are regarded &#x27;as a large Kingdom Hall&#x27;. Undignified behavior is considered inappropriate during their religious events, even if the facility is an entertainment venue.
== Uses ==
===Meetings for worship===

Congregations typically meet in their Kingdom Halls two days each week for worship. Meetings usually open and close with song and prayer. Meetings held in the Kingdom Hall include Bible readings and public talks on matters such as the Bible, family life, Christian qualities and prophecy. There are discussions of specially prepared study articles in &quot;The Watchtower&quot; magazine and other publications of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Witnesses usually meet in Kingdom Halls for preparation and prayer before engaging in their door-to-door ministry. 

===Classes===
Kingdom Halls may also be used to teach sign language or other language classes. Kingdom Halls are also used for sessions especially developed for particular areas of service, such as the &quot;Pioneer Service School&quot; for full-time preachers, and the &quot;Kingdom Ministry School&quot; for elders and ministerial servants. In areas where the literacy rate is low, congregations may arrange to use Kingdom Halls to conduct literacy classes, which non-Witnesses may also attend.
===Weddings===
Kingdom Halls may be used for wedding ceremonies of Witness-baptized couples. A couple sends a request in writing to the congregation&#x27;s &quot;service committee&quot;, which assesses whether the couple is &quot;in good standing, living in harmony with Bible principles and Jehovah’s righteous standards&quot; and that they approve of the members of the couple&#x27;s wedding party, the groomsmen and bridesmaids.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses attach no special significance to a Kingdom Hall wedding over a secular service. Witness couples may choose to be married elsewhere for personal or practical reasons. Kingdom Halls are not used for wedding receptions or other social events.

===Funerals===
Funeral services may be held in a Kingdom Hall if the body of elders considers that &quot;the deceased had a clean reputation and was a member of the congregation or the minor child of a member&quot;. The family of the deceased may ask any respected male member of the congregation to conduct the service, which involves a simple Bible-based discourse. Depending on family preference and local custom, a Kingdom Hall funeral may or may not have the casketed deceased present.

===Disaster relief===
Disaster relief efforts of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are typically channeled through permanent local Disaster Relief Committees under the various branch offices, and are staged at Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls as close as practical to the disaster area.

==Construction==

The construction crews of Kingdom Halls and larger Assembly Halls consist of volunteering Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, sometimes from other countries, who have been pre-approved for work on construction sites.

Witnesses in many countries use a number of standard designs for construction that can be built in just a few days. The act of constructing a Kingdom Hall in this manner after the initial foundations are laid is called a &quot;quick-build&quot;.

A Kingdom Hall or Assembly Hall may originate from the renovation of an existing structure, such as a theater or non-Witness house of worship. In areas of repeated or reputed vandalism, particularly in cities, some Kingdom Halls are built without windows to reduce the risk of property damage.

In 2015, it was announced to elders in the United States that new Kingdom Halls worldwide would use standardized designs and materials, suited to local circumstances. 

=== Regional Building Committees ===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; branch offices formerly appointed local Regional Building Committees (RBC) to oversee the construction and maintenance of their places of worship. Such committees - which usually consisted of five to seven persons, often with experience in construction trades - aimed to coordinate the efforts of those involved so as to provide attractive and functional facilities that are financially viable.

RBCs cooperated with local congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses seeking to build or renovate a place of worship, under the direction of the local branch office. Committees helped in assessing the suitability of a possible construction-site, purchasing the land and materials and coordinating the efforts of volunteers from the wider area. Members of a Regional Building Committee worked voluntarily and received no remuneration for their work.

On Saturday, January 31, 2015, in a special meeting with all elders in the United States via live video-feed, it was announced that Regional Building Committees would be replaced by Local Design/Construction Department of the branch office, but with a more defined organizational structure.

===Funding===
In 1983, an arrangement was instituted whereby loans from the Watch Tower Society financed Kingdom Halls. In addition to contribution boxes for local congregation expenses and &quot;the worldwide work&quot;, each congregation had a contribution box specifically for voluntary donations toward Kingdom-Hall construction. The Watch Tower Society pooled these donations into the &quot;Society Kingdom Hall Fund&quot; for financing the construction of Kingdom Halls worldwide, particularly in developing nations. 

When a congregation received local approval to build a new Kingdom Hall, that congregation could apply for a loan from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund. The congregation repaid the loan to the Watch Tower Society, in addition to its continued contributions to the Kingdom Hall Fund. Interest was charged on the loans until September 2008.

The way Kingdom Halls are funded changed significantly in 2014. The provision of Kingdom Hall loans from the Society ceased, as did the separate &quot;Society Kingdom Hall Fund&quot;. Instead, all congregations were directed to contribute an ongoing amount to the branch office each month, in addition to donations for other purposes, into a single &quot;World Wide Work&quot; fund, and the branch office finances new Kingdom Halls. The stated purpose was so that funding from more affluent areas could supplement funding from areas without the resources for a new hall. The monthly amount was initially based on &quot;a confidential survey of all publishers&quot; indicating how much they could commit each month, with a recommendation that the amount be &quot;&quot;at least&quot; the same amount as the current monthly loan repayment&quot;. As of 2020, the amount is &quot;based on a monthly per-publisher amount suggested by the branch office&quot; and reviewed by local congregation elders.

==Maintenance==
Routine maintenance of Kingdom Halls is performed by the members of the congregations that use them, typically according to a scheduled checklist. The &quot;Kingdom Hall operating committee&quot; oversees maintenance of the building. At least one elder or ministerial servant from each congregation is selected to be part of the operating committee. Kingdom Hall maintenance costs are covered by donations to a local fund.

<doc id="251233" wikidata="Q5080225" url="?curid=251233" title="Charles Lever">
<text>Charles James Lever (31 August 1806 – 1 June 1872) was an Irish novelist and raconteur, whose novels, according to Anthony Trollope, were just like his conversation.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lever was born in Amiens Street, Dublin, the second son of James Lever, an architect and builder, and was educated in private schools. His escapades at Trinity College, Dublin (1823–1828), where he took the degree in medicine in 1831, are drawn on for the plots of some of his novels. The character Frank Webber in the novel &quot;Charles O&#x27;Malley&quot; was based on a college friend, Robert Boyle, who later became a clergyman. Lever and Boyle earned pocket-money singing ballads of their own composing in the streets of Dublin and played many other pranks which Lever embellished in the novels &quot;O&#x27;Malley&quot;, &quot;Con Cregan&quot; and &quot;Lord Kilgobbin&quot;. Before seriously embarking upon his medical studies, Lever visited Canada as an unqualified surgeon on an emigrant ship, and has drawn upon some of his experiences in &quot;Con Cregan&quot;, &quot;Arthur O&#x27;Leary&quot; and &quot;Roland Cashel&quot;. Arriving in Canada, he journeyed into the backwoods, where he was affiliated to a tribe of Native Americans but had to flee because his life was in danger, as later his character Bagenal Daly did in his novel &quot;The Knight of Gwynne&quot;.

Back in Europe, he pretended he was a student from the University of Göttingen and travelled to the University of Jena (where he saw Goethe), and then to Vienna. He loved German student life, and several of his songs, such as &quot;The Pope He Loved a Merry Life&quot;, are based on student-song models. His medical degree earned him an appointment to the Board of Health in County Clare and then as a dispensary doctor in Portstewart, County Londonderry, but his conduct as a country doctor earned him the censure of the authorities.

===Career===
In 1833 he married his first love, Catherine Baker, and in February 1837, after varied experiences, he began publishing &quot;The Confessions of Harry Lorrequer&quot; in the recently established &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;. During the previous seven years, the popular taste had turned toward the &quot;service novel&quot;, examples of which include &quot;Frank Mildmay&quot; (1829) by Frederick Marryat, &quot;Tom Cringle&#x27;s Log&quot; (1829) by Michael Scott, &quot;The Subaltern&quot; (1825) by George Robert Gleig, &quot;Cyril Thornton&quot; (1827) by Thomas Hamilton, &quot;Stories of Waterloo&quot; (1833) by William Hamilton Maxwell, &quot;Ben Brace&quot; (1840) by Frederick Chamier and &quot;The Bivouac&quot; (1837), also by Maxwell. Lever had met William Hamilton Maxwell, the titular founder of the genre. Before &quot;Harry Lorrequer&quot; appeared in volume form (1839), Lever had settled - on the strength of a slight diplomatic connection - as a fashionable physician in Brussels (Hertogstraat 16).

&quot;Lorrequer&quot; was merely a string of Irish and other stories - good, bad and indifferent, but mostly rollicking. Lever, who strung together his anecdotes late at night after the serious business of his day, was astonished at its success. &quot;If this sort of thing amuses them, I can go on forever.&quot; Brussels was indeed a superb place for the observation of half-pay officers, such as Major Monsoon (&quot;Commissioner Meade&quot;), Captain Bubbleton and the like, who terrorised the taverns of the place with their endless Peninsular stories, and of English society a little damaged, which it became the speciality of Lever to depict. He sketched with a free hand, wrote, as he lived, from hand to mouth, and the chief difficulty he experienced was that of getting rid of his characters who &quot;hung about him like those tiresome people who never can make up their minds to bid you good night&quot;. Lever had never taken part in a battle himself, but his next three books, &quot;Charles O&#x27;Malley&quot; (1841), &quot;Jack Hinton&quot; (1843), and &quot;Tom Burke of Ours&quot; (1844), written under the spur of the writer&#x27;s chronic extravagance, contain some splendid military writing and some of the most animated battle-pieces on record. In pages of &quot;O&#x27;Malley&quot; and &quot;Tom Burke&quot; Lever anticipates not a few of the best effects of Marbot, Thibaut, Lejeune, Griois, Seruzier, Burgoyne and the like. His account of the Douro need hardly fear comparison, it has been said, with Napier&#x27;s. Condemned by the critics, Lever had completely won the general reader - from the Iron Duke himself downwards.

In 1842 he returned to Dublin to edit the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, and gathered round him a typical coterie of Irish wits (including one or two hornets) such as the O&#x27;Suilivans, Archer Butler, William Carleton, Sir William Wilde, Canon Hayman, DF McCarthy, McGlashan, Dr Kencaly and many others. In June 1842 he welcomed at Templeogue, four miles southwest of Dublin, the author of the &quot;Snob Papers&quot; on his Irish tour (the &quot;Sketch Book&quot; was, later, dedicated to Lever). Thackeray recognised the fund of Irish sadness beneath the surface merriment. &quot;The author&#x27;s character is not humour but sentiment. The spirits are mostly artificial, the fond is sadness, as appears to me to be that of most Irish writing and people.&quot; The Waterloo episode in Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1847-1848) was in part an outcome of the talk between the two novelists. But the &quot;Galway pace&quot;, the display he found it necessary to maintain at Templeogue, the stable full of horses, the cards, the friends to entertain, the quarrels to compose and the enormous rapidity with which he had to complete &quot;Tom Burke&quot;, &quot;The O&#x27;Donoghue&quot; and &quot;Arthur O&#x27;Leary&quot; (1845) made his native land an impossible place for Lever to continue in. Templeogue would soon have proved another Abbotsford.

Thackeray suggested London, but Lever required a new field of literary observation and anecdote. His creative inspiration exhausted, he decided to renew it on the continent. In 1845 he resigned his editorship and went back to Brussels, whence he started upon an unlimited tour of central Europe in a family coach. Now and again he halted for a few months, and entertained to the limit of his resources in some ducal castle or other which he hired for an off-season. Thus at Riedenburg, near Bregenz, in August 1846, he entertained Charles Dickens and his wife and other well-known people. Dickens would later publish Lever&#x27;s novel &quot;A Day&#x27;s Ride&quot; in serial in his weekly journal &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, running parallel to &quot;Great Expectations&quot; for part of its run from 1860 to 1861. Like his own &quot;Daltons&quot; or &quot;Dodd Family Abroad&quot; he travelled continentally, from Karlsruhe to Como, from Como to Florence, from Florence to the Baths of Lucca and so on, and his letters home are the litany of the literary remittance-man, his ambition now limited to driving a pair of novels abreast without a diminution of his standard price for serial work (&quot;twenty pounds a sheet&quot;). In the &quot;Knight of Gwynne, a story of the Union&quot; (1847), &quot;The Confessions of Con Cregan&quot; (1849), &quot;Roland Cashel&quot; (1850) and &quot;Maurice Tiernay&quot; (1852) we still have traces of his old manner; but he was beginning to lose his original joy in composition. His innate sadness began to cloud the animal joyousness of his temperament. Formerly he had written for the happy world which is young and curly and merry; now he grew fat and bald and grave. &quot;After 38 or so what has life to offer but one universal declension. Let the crew pump as hard as they like, the leak gains every hour.&quot; His son, Charles Sidney Lever, died in 1863 and is buried in Florence&#x27;s English Cemetery.

===Later life===
Depressed in spirit as Lever was, his wit was unextinguished; he was still the delight of the salons with his stories, and in 1867, after a few years&#x27; experience of a similar kind at Spezia, he was cheered by a letter from Lord Derby offering him the more lucrative consulship of Trieste. &quot;Here is six hundred a year for doing nothing, and you are just the man to do it.&quot; The six hundred could not atone to Lever for the lassitude of prolonged exile. Trieste, at first &quot;all that I could desire&quot;, became with characteristic abruptness &quot;detestable and damnable&quot;. &quot;Nothing to eat, nothing to drink, no one to speak to.&quot; &quot;Of all the dreary places it has been my lot to sojourn in this is the worst&quot; (some references to Trieste will be found in &quot;That Boy of Norcott&#x27;s&quot;, 1869). He could never be alone and was almost morbidly dependent upon literary encouragement. Fortunately, like Scott, he had unscrupulous friends who assured him that his last efforts were his best. They include &quot;The Fortunes of Glencore&quot; (1857), &quot;Tony Butler&quot; (1865), &quot;Luttrell of Arran&quot; (1865), &quot;Sir Brooke Fosbrooke&quot; (1866), &quot;Lord Kilgobbin&quot; (1872) and the table-talk of &quot;Cornelius O&#x27;Dowd&quot;, originally contributed to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;.

His depression, partly due to incipient heart disease, partly to the growing conviction that he was the victim of literary and critical conspiracy, was confirmed by the death of his wife (23 April 1870), to whom he was tenderly attached. He visited Ireland in the following year and seemed alternately in high and low spirits. Death had already given him one or two runaway knocks, and, after his return to Trieste, he failed gradually, dying suddenly, however, and almost painlessly, from heart failure on 1 June 1872 at his home, Villa Gasteiger. His daughters, one of whom, Sydney, is believed to have been the real author of &quot;A Rent in a Cloud&quot; (1869), were well provided for.

==Assessments==
Trollope praised Lever&#x27;s novels highly when he said that they were just like his conversation. He was a born raconteur, and had in perfection that easy flow of light description which without tedium or hurry leads up to the point of the good stories of which in earlier days his supply seemed inexhaustible. With little respect for unity of action or conventional novel structure, his brightest books, such as &quot;Lorrequer&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Malley&quot; and &quot;Tom Burke&quot;, are in fact little more than recitals of scenes in the life of a particular &quot;hero&quot;, unconnected by any continuous intrigue. The type of character he depicted is for the most part elementary. His women are mostly roués, romps or Xanthippes; his heroes have too much of the Pickle temper about them and fall an easy prey to the serious attacks of Poe or to the more playful gibes of Thackeray in &quot;Phil Fogarty&quot; or Bret Harte in &quot;Terence Denville&quot;. This last is a perfect bit of burlesque. Terence exchanges nineteen shots with the Hon. Captain Henry Somerset in the glen. &quot;At each fire I shot away a button from his uniform. As my last bullet shot off the last button from his sleeve, I remarked quietly, &#x27;You seem now, my lord, to be almost as ragged as the gentry you sneered at,&#x27; and rode haughtily away.&quot; And yet these careless sketches contain such haunting creations as Frank Webber, Major Monsoon and Micky Free, &quot;the Sam Weller of Ireland&quot;.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:
A library edition of the novels in 37 volumes appeared from 1897 to 1899 under the superintendence of Lever&#x27;s daughter, Julie Kate Neville. Henry Hawley Smart is said to have taken Lever&#x27;s work as one of his models when he set out on his career as a sporting novelist. Eugene O&#x27;Neill lists Lever as one of the authors represented on the family bookshelf in &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, along with Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Gibbon, &quot;et al&quot;.

<doc id="251234" wikidata="Q2890818" url="?curid=251234" title="Battle of Resaca de la Palma">
<text>The Battle of Resaca de la Palma was one of the early engagements of the Mexican–American War, where the United States Army under General Zachary Taylor engaged the retreating forces of the Mexican &quot;Ejército del Norte&quot; (&quot;Army of the North&quot;) under General Mariano Arista on May 9, 1846. The United States emerged victorious and forced the Mexicans out of Texas.

==Background==

Following the Mexican defeat at the Battle of Palo Alto the previous day, Arista on the morning of May 9 moved his forces to a more defensible position along a resaca, known as Resaca de Guerrero to the Mexicans but as Resaca de la Palma to the Americans. Recalling his experiences at the Siege of Fort Texas, he positioned his forces along the twelve foot deep and two hundred foot wide resaca, three miles from the Rio Grande, by 10 a.m. Arista placed most of his infantry in the ravine, thickly forested on either side, to negate the effectiveness of Taylor&#x27;s artillery, with the 6th and 10th Infantry, Sappers, 2nd Light Infantry and 1st Infantry being placed east of the road, and the 2nd Infantry, Tampico Battalion and 4th Infantry west of the road. Covering the flanks in the rear were the &quot;Presidiales&quot;, the light cavalry, and the 7th and 8th Regiments, and two artillery batteries on the south bank.

Taylor reached the area about 3 p.m. and ordered Captain William W. Mackall&#x27;s skirmishers and Captain Randolph Ridgely&#x27;s battery along the road, with the 4th and 5th Infantry to the left and the remaining 4th and 3rd Infantry on the right.

==Battle==
American forces began to encounter the Mexican lines at around three in the afternoon. The advance party of skirmishers under Captain Mackall had been pursuing Arista&#x27;s army throughout the morning and early afternoon, and as they reached the brush around the resaca the group came under heavy rifle and artillery fire. Mackall attempted to press further in order to gain a clearer view of the Mexican position, but, lacking the firepower of Taylor&#x27;s main body, was ultimately forced to retreat and await reinforcements.

By four, General Taylor had linked with Captain Mackall and had begun to deploy his army to assault Arista&#x27;s position. First, he moved to destroy the Mexican skirmish line which was harassing his movements. Two infantry regiments, supported by Ridgely&#x27;s artillery battery, were able to converge on Arista&#x27;s skirmishers and force them back into the Mexican main line with heavy casualties. With his immediate front clear, Taylor began to press his attacks on Arista&#x27;s flanks.

Fighting was disorganized and uncoordinated due to the dense chaparral and the intense Mexican artillery fire, although Ridgely did repulse a Mexican cavalry charge. As regiments entered the heavy underbrush unit cohesion broke down, as smaller and smaller groups became visibly separated from each other; many of these groups were led by non-commissioned officers as the regular officers became cut off from the rest of their men. However, this same issue plagued the Mexican defenders, as the chaparral hampered the lines of communication as well as lines of sight. As a result, the majority of the fighting occurred simultaneously but also independently within these small, separate groups, as each lacked information on the battle as a whole. This breakup of unit integrity effectively negated many of the defensive and numerical advantages the Mexican Army would have ordinarily enjoyed.

Due to the low visibility of the chaparral, Ridgely&#x27;s artillery battery was unable to provide much support to the American assaults on the flanks. Rather, they concentrated on neutralizing Arista&#x27;s artillery; the resulting artillery duel proved inconclusive. Taylor ordered a charge by Captain Charles A. May&#x27;s dragoon squadron with the objective of clearing the Mexican battery. Supposedly, May said, &quot;Hello Ridgely, where is that Battery? I am ordered to charge it&quot;, and Ridgely replied &quot;Hold on Charley, &#x27;till I draw their fire and you will see where they are.&quot; May&#x27;s charge however carried them well past the Mexican artillery and although he managed to capture General Romulo Diaz de la Vega, he could not hold the guns. Taylor then ordered William G. Belknap&#x27;s 5th and 8th Infantry to secure the guns, which they did. The Mexicans forces east of the road then retreated from their positions.

Up until this point of the engagement, General Arista had not taken the field to command, but rather had been in his tent performing his administrative duties. Though he had received word of the American assault, he believed it to be minor given the late hour and the assumed superiority of his position. Only when his line had begun to seriously crumble did Arista acknowledge the severity of the battle. After failing to rally his retreating infantry, Arista personally led a cavalry charge to try and break up American gains on the southern bank of the resaca. Though initially finding some success, the rough terrain quickly broke up the charge before it could deal any major damage to Taylor&#x27;s forces.

West of the road, Captain Robert C. Buchanan and men of the 4th Infantry found a trail which turned towards the Mexican left flank, enabling them to take and hold the battery located there. They held the position against General Pedro de Ampudia&#x27;s counterattacks, and the entire Mexican force panicked and fled across the Rio Grande, with many Mexican soldiers drowning in the attempt.

==Aftermath==
The victory at Resaca de la Palma quickly rose to great renown among the American military and public. Personal documents from soldiers attached to General Taylor&#x27;s army highlight tremendous joy and excitement from the Mexican rout, boosting an already confident morale. For the American public, the victory was among the first news they had heard of the war. In fact, Mexico&#x27;s declaration of war against the United States did not even reach President James Polk in Washington D.C. until May 9, the very day that the Battle of Resaca de la Palma was fought. As a result of this delay, a majority of American citizens received the news of the outbreak of hostilities and the victory at Resaca de la Palma simultaneously. The overwhelming success of General Taylor against the Mexican forces colored the American perception of the war, and Congress&#x27; call for the raising of new regiments (ratified prior to the news of the victory) was quickly overfilled by thousands of eager volunteers.

The Battle of Resaca de la Palma blunted the Mexican offensive into Texan territory and opened an opportunity for General Taylor to invade Mexico. Strategically, the battle cemented American tactics that they would use throughout the war to great effect; in particular, Resaca de la Palma highlighted the power of American artillery against their Mexican counterparts and the ways in which Mexican commanders sought to neutralize that advantage. The mix of different types of shot used by Ridgely&#x27;s gunners also proved to be quite potent and allowed them to respond to a variety of battlefield situations much more rapidly than the Mexican artillery, especially when confronting cavalry charges.

The Mexican Army left behind a number of artillery pieces, the colors of Mexico&#x27;s lauded Tampico Battalion, and other baggage which included Arista&#x27;s writing desk and silver service. One of the most important finds among the documents was General Arista&#x27;s personal map of the Eastern Interior Department, which provided a detailed, up-to-date view of the surrounding regions of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Coahuila. This comprehensive map proved to be much more reliable than General Taylor&#x27;s maps, which, having been made in the early 1830&#x27;s, were over a decade old. The capture of this map provided Taylor with an invaluable resource in planning the next phase of his campaign, especially now that the fighting had moved to the opposite side of the Rio Grande, where American intelligence was less reliable. Among the several captured Mexican artillery pieces were two 8-pounder bronze guns, two 6-pounder bronze guns, and four 4-pounder bronze guns.

The rout of General Arista&#x27;s army at Resaca de la Palma also relieved the Mexican siege of Fort Texas, where a garrison had been left following Taylor&#x27;s move to Point Isabel prior to the Battle of Palo Alto. Only eight miles from Palo Alto and four miles from Resaca de la Palma, the garrison was well within earshot of the fighting and the noise of the battles proved a great boost to the morale of the besieged men. As the Mexican lines deteriorated, the batteries at Fort Texas were able to contribute to the rout, joining with Taylor&#x27;s advance troops in forcing Arista&#x27;s army back across the Rio Grande.

Taylor&#x27;s army settled into their Fort Texas campsite as Taylor considered his next move, although he did exchange prisoners with Arista. Taylor crossed the Rio Grande on 18 May, Arista&#x27;s army having abandoned their artillery, sick and wounded at Linares, Nuevo Leon during their retreat to Monterrey.
Before accepting a prisoner exchange with General Arista, Taylor was noted for his humane treatment of the abandoned Mexican wounded, giving them the same care as was given to the American wounded. After tending to the wounded he performed the last rites for the dead of both the American and Mexican soldiers killed during the battle. General Arista was also recognized for his care of captured American soldiers, especially pertaining to the men belonging to Captain Seth Thornton&#x27;s cavalry patrol which had been ambushed within the first days of the conflict.

The Resaca De La Palma Battlefield is in the city limits of present-day Brownsville, Texas, but is part of the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park.

The Battle of Resaca de la Palma inspired the name of Resaca, Georgia, a community that later became the site of the Battle of Resaca.

<text>William Archer Butler (c. 18145 July 1848) was an Irish historian of philosophy.

==Life==
He was born at Annerville, near Clonmel in Ireland. His father was a Protestant, his mother a Roman Catholic, and he was brought up as a Catholic. As a boy he was imaginative and poetical, and some of his early verses were remarkable. While yet at Clonmel school he became a Protestant. Later he entered and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. where he had a brilliant career. He specially devoted himself to literature and metaphysics, and was noted for the beauty of his style. In 1834 he gained the ethical moderatorship, newly instituted by Provost Lloyd, and continued in residence at college. In 1837 he decided to enter the Church, and in the same year he was elected to the professorship of moral philosophy, specially founded for him through Lloyd&#x27;s exertions.

About the same time he was presented to the prebend of Clondahorky, Donegal, and resided there when not called by his professorial duties to Dublin. In 1842 he was promoted to the rectory of Raymochy. He died on 5 July 1848.

==Works==
His &quot;Sermons&quot; (2 vols., 1849) were brilliant and forceful. The Lectures on the &quot;History of Ancient Philosophy&quot;, edited by W. Hepworth Thompson (2 vols., 5856; 2nd ed., 1 vol. 1875) were among the few British works on the history of philosophy. These works include introductory lectures, the early Greek thinkers, and lectures on Plato.

Among his other writings were papers in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; (1834–1837); and &quot;Letters on Development&quot; (in the &quot;Irish Ecclesiastical Journal&quot;, 1845), a reply to Newman&#x27;s famous &quot;Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine&quot;.

<doc id="251238" wikidata="Q1191375" url="?curid=251238" title="Departments of the Continental Army">
<text>In the American Revolutionary War units of the Continental Army were assigned to any one of seven regional or &quot;territorial&quot; departments to decentralize their command and administration. This was necessary because the regiment was the largest permanent unit in the Continental Army. A superior headquarters, above regiment, was needed if more than a few regiments were stationed in the same department. Although brigades, divisions, and field armies existed, they were temporary units which did not necessarily include all the units assigned to a department. Nor did field armies include establishments of the staff, such as &quot;magazines&quot; (supply depots) of the Quartermaster General&#x27;s Department, or hospitals of the Hospital Department. The militia in a department was usually at the disposal of the department commander.

==Departmental organization==
The Continental troops in a department constituted its garrison. If the garrison was sufficiently large, the units might be assembled into a field army. In this case the commander of the territorial department and the commander of the field army would be one and the same officer. Thus, the commanding general of the Northern Department was also commanding general of the Northern Army, and the commanding general of the Southern Department was also commanding general of the Southern Army. Armies did not, however, invariably receive a geographical designation. Because the field army under Washington&#x27;s personal command contained the majority of Continental Army units it was designated the Main Army. Each department had a semi-autonomous commanding officer, usually a commanding general, under the overall command of Washington as General and Commander-in-Chief. The Continental Congress dealt with and through the department commanders.

===Appointment of department commanders===

Throughout the war, the Continental Congress retained exclusive authority to appoint or remove department commanders. In practice, when an urgent need arose, a temporary commander was just as frequently appointed by George Washington or the executive power of one of the states, pending the approval of the Continental Congress. Many of these temporary department commanders were then confirmed and formally appointed by the Congress. This practice, along with control of the Continental Army and Navy through the war and marine committees of the Continental Congress, established the precedent for civil control of military affairs later embodied in the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

===Relations between the departments and the states===

The department commanders and their staffs also worked directly with the governments of the states within their department. At first these were the &quot;ad hoc&quot; provisional governments developed in 1774 and 1775, but the practice continued after 1776 when the states replaced their Provincial Congresses and Conventions with permanent governments operating under written constitutions. Ordinarily departments were commanded by major generals. Washington as a full general was the ranking general officer in the Continental Army throughout the war.

==Departments==
In general there were seven territorial departments, although their boundaries were subject to change and they were not all in existence throughout the war.

===Canadian Department===

The establishment of the Canadian Department reflected the aspirations of the Continental Congress and some Americans to annex the British province of Quebec, then often referred to as &quot;Canada&quot;, but the effort was ultimately unsuccessful. Although the Americans captured Montreal in November 1775, and established their headquarters at Château Ramezay, the region was never entirely under the control of the Continental Army. The Canadian Department was formally established from the New York Department on January 17, 1776. After the Invasion of Canada failed, all troops were withdrawn to Fort Ticonderoga, New York. The Canadian Department was officially discontinued on July 8, 1776.

===Eastern Department===

The Eastern Department was formed around those states that had originally sent troops to support the Siege of Boston, and in that sense it even existed before the Continental Army.
This was essentially the New England department, and included the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts (including the present state of Maine), Rhode Island, and Connecticut. For the first year of the war, the field army associated with this department, under the command of General Washington, was variously designated as the Continental Army, Grand Army, or Main Army. The Eastern Department was formally established on April 4, 1776 when the Main Army under Washington moved from Boston to New York City. Important operations in this department included the Siege of Boston in 1775–1776 and the Battle of Rhode Island in 1779. The department was discontinued in November 1779.

===Northern Department===

The predecessor of the Northern Department was the New York Department, which was established on June 25, 1775. This department was sometimes described as the Separate Department and the troops stationed in it were known as the &quot;Separate Army&quot;. The original New York Department was coextensive with the Province of New York. The department&#x27;s boundaries were extended to include Canada in the initial phase of the Invasion of Canada, but Canada was established as a separate department on January 17, 1776. When the Middle Department was created on February 27, 1776 the New York Department was merged into it. The Middle Department, as originally organized, included all of the colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. The inclusion of New York in the Middle Department continued for less than two months, however. In April 1776 the Main Army moved from Boston to New York City and Washington assumed command of the Middle Department. The Northern Department was formally established from the Middle Department on April 14, 1776. The reorganized Northern Department included only that portion of the colony of New York north of the Hudson Highlands, and the present state of Vermont. The field army associated with the Northern Department was known as the Northern Army. Operations in this department did not end with Saratoga. Fighting continued in the Northern Department until the end of the war. The department was discontinued upon the death of its last commander, General Alexander, at Albany on January 15, 1783.

===Highlands Department===

The Highlands Department was the smallest in area. Strictly speaking, it was part of the Middle Department, but because of its importance it was virtually a separate department. The Highlands Department was formed around the defenses on the Hudson River about north of New York City, where the Appalachians and the Hudson intersect. After the British occupied New York City in 1776 the defenses just north of there became critically important. The presence of British naval forces at New York emphasized the importance of the Hudson River, and both sides in the war recognized the importance of controlling that waterway. The Americans created fortifications, including West Point with its chain across the river. Washington assigned Continental troops under General Heath to the Highlands on November 12, 1776 and there was a Continental Army garrison in the Highlands from then until the end of the war. Heath&#x27;s assignment thus created a &quot;de facto&quot; military department. The British sought to gain control with the Saratoga campaign in 1777, and frequently raided into the southern reaches of the department to interfere with the movement of military goods and personnel. One of the most notable incidents in the history of this department was the defection of Benedict Arnold in September 1780.

===Middle Department===

The Middle Department was established on February 27, 1776. Originally it included all of the colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. In April 1776, the Main Army moved from Boston to New York, and became the field army associated with the Middle Department for the remainder of the war. On April 14, 1776 that portion of New York north of the Hudson Highlands, and the present state of Vermont were separated from the Middle Department and organized as the Northern Department. The Middle Department then comprised the Hudson Highlands in the state of New York, the rest of New York south of the Highlands, and the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland.

The term Main Army had come into use during the Siege of Boston, because the majority of Continental Army regiments were assigned to it. The term was retained throughout the war. Most units in the Middle Department were assigned to the Main Army, under George Washington, or to the Highlands Department, which was under Washington&#x27;s close supervision. A few regiments and independent companies were assigned to the Middle Department from time to time, but were not assigned to Washington&#x27;s army or to the Highlands. These units were simply said to have been assigned to the Middle Department.

Some of the Continental Army&#x27;s most important campaigns were fought in this department. These included the New York campaign and the New Jersey campaign which ended with the battles of Trenton and Princeton. The Philadelphia campaign was fought in this department, after which the Continental Army went into winter quarters at Valley Forge. In 1778 this department was the scene of the Monmouth campaign. After Monmouth, on June 28, 1778, major military operations in the United States shifted to the Southern Department. The department existed until the close of the war. It was the scene of one of the war&#x27;s last episodes when the British Army evacuated New York City on November 25, 1783.

===Western Department===

The Western Department covered the frontier territories west and northwest of Virginia and Pennsylvania, including the present states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It extended from Pittsburgh all the way to the Illinois country and as far north as the southern peninsula of Michigan. The department was established in 1777. Its first commander was Edward Hand. George Rogers Clark&#x27;s Illinois campaign of 1779 was one of the most notable operations in this department. This department was the only one to remain after the war. The last elements of the Continental Army, stationed at Fort Pitt, were kept to guard the western frontier outposts.

===Southern Department===

The Southern Department was formally established on February 27, 1776. The department included Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia and the western frontiers of those colonies, from which were created the present states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The field army associated with this department was known as the Southern Army. The Southern Department was the most independent of the commands due to geography and the need for year-round operations. Most of the territorial departments to the north of this department suspended offensive operations for the winter and early spring. The Southern Department was also the only one in which the troops assigned were destroyed twice. The first time was at the surrender of Charleston on May 12, 1780. The second was at the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780. Despite these two catastrophic defeats, however, this department was the location of the Siege of Yorktown, in 1781, which effectively decided the outcome of the war. Important events in the Southern Department after Yorktown were the evacuation of Savannah and Charleston in July and December 1782. The Southern Department existed until the close of the war.

<text>Albert Schwegler (10 February 18195 January 1857) was a German philosopher and Protestant theologian.

==Biography==

Schwegler was born at Michelbach in Württemberg, the son of a country pastor. He entered the University of Tübingen in 1836, and was one of the earliest pupils of F. C. Baur, under whose influence he devoted himself to church history. His first work was &quot;Der Montanismus und die christliche Kirche des Zweiten Jahrhunderts&quot; (1841), in which he pointed out for the first time that Montanism was much more than an isolated outbreak of eccentric fanaticism in the early church, though he himself introduced fresh misconceptions by connecting it with Ebionitism as he conceived the latter. This work, with other essays, brought him into conflict with the authorities of the church, in consequence of which he gave up theology as his professional study and chose that of philosophy.

In 1843 he founded the &quot;Jahrbücher der Gegenwart&quot;, and became &quot;privatdozent&quot; of philosophy and classical philology at Tübingen University. In 1848 he was made an associate professor of Roman literature and archaeology, and soon afterwards a full professor of history.

He died in Tübingen.

==Work==

His principal theological work was &quot;Das nachapostolische Zeitalter in den Hauptmomenten seiner Entwicklung&quot; (&quot;The Post-Apostolic Age in the Principal Moments of its Development&quot;) (2 volumes, 1846). It was this book which first put before the world, with Schwegler&#x27;s characteristic boldness and clearness, the results of the critical labours of the earlier representatives of the new Tübingen school in relation to the first development of Christianity.

Schwegler published also an edition of the &quot;Clementine Homilies&quot; (1847), and of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (1852). His work on the history of philosophy includes his excellent &quot;Geschichte der Philosophie im Umriß&quot; (&quot;History of Philosophy in Epitome&quot;, 1846–1847, 14th ed. 1887; 1st edition of English translation by James Hutchison Stirling titled &quot;Handbook of the History of Philosophy&quot;, 1867; 5th edition of English translation by Julius Hawley Seelye titled &quot;History of Philosophy in Epitome&quot;, 1877), his &quot;Übersetzung und Erläuterung der aristotelischen Metaphysik&quot; (4 volumes, 1847–48), and a posthumous &quot;Geschichte der griechischen Philosophie&quot; (&quot;History of Greek Philosophy&quot;; 1859).

In history he began a &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; (vols. i.–iii., 1853–58, 2nd edition 1867–72), which he brought down only to the laws of Licinius.

<doc id="251240" wikidata="Q193405" url="?curid=251240" title="Emil Cioran">
<text>Emil Mihai Cioran (; ; ; 8 April 1911 – 20 June 1995) was a Romanian philosopher, aphorist and essayist, who published works in both Romanian and French. His work has been noted for its pervasive philosophical pessimism, style, and aphorisms. His works frequently engaged with issues of suffering, decay, and nihilism. In 1937, Cioran moved to the Latin Quarter of Paris, which became his permanent residence, wherein he lived in seclusion with his partner, Simone Boué, until his death in 1995.

==Early life==
Cioran was born in Resinár, Szeben County, Kingdom of Hungary (today Rășinari, Sibiu County, Romania). His father, Emilian Cioran, was an Orthodox priest, and his mother, Elvira, was the head of the &quot;Christian Women&#x27;s League&quot;.

At 10, Cioran moved to Sibiu to attend school, and at 17, he was enrolled in the Faculty of Literature and Philosophy at the University of Bucharest, where he met Eugène Ionesco and Mircea Eliade, who became his friends. Future Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica and future Romanian thinker Petre Țuțea became his closest academic colleagues; all three studied under Tudor Vianu and Nae Ionescu. Cioran, Eliade, and Țuțea became supporters of Ionescu&#x27;s ideas, known as &quot;Trăirism.&quot;

Cioran had a good command of German, learning the language at an early age, and proceeded to read philosophy that was available in German, but not in Romanian. Notes from Cioran&#x27;s adolescence indicated a study of Friedrich Nietzsche, Honoré de Balzac, Arthur Schopenhauer and Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others. He became an agnostic, taking as an axiom &quot;the inconvenience of existence&quot;. While at the university, he was influenced by Georg Simmel, Ludwig Klages and Martin Heidegger, but also by the Russian philosopher Lev Shestov, whose contribution to Cioran&#x27;s central system of thought was the belief that life is arbitrary. Cioran&#x27;s graduation thesis was on Henri Bergson, whom he later rejected, claiming Bergson did not comprehend the tragedy of life.

From the age of 20, Cioran began to suffer from insomnia, a condition which he suffered from for the rest of his life, and permeated his writings. Cioran&#x27;s decision to write about his experiences in his first book, &quot;On the Heights of Despair&quot;, came from an episode of insomnia.

==Career==

===Berlin and Romania===
In 1933, he received a scholarship to the University of Berlin, where he studied Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Hegel, Edmund Husserl, Immanuel Kant, Georg Simmel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. Here, he came into contact with Klages and Nicolai Hartmann. While in Berlin, he became interested in the policies of the Nazi regime, contributed a column to &quot;Vremea&quot; dealing with the topic (in which Cioran confessed that &quot;there is no present-day politician that I see as more sympathetic and admirable than Hitler&quot;, while expressing his approval for the Night of the Long Knives—&quot;what has humanity lost if the lives of a few imbeciles were taken&quot;), and, in a letter written to Petru Comarnescu, described himself as &quot;a Hitlerist&quot;. He held similar views about Italian fascism, welcoming victories in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, arguing that: &quot;Fascism is a shock, without which Italy is a compromise comparable to today&#x27;s Romania&quot;.

Cioran&#x27;s first book, &quot; Pe culmile disperării&quot; (literally translated: &quot;On the Heights of Despair&quot;), was published in Romania in 1934. It was awarded the &quot;Commission&#x27;s Prize&quot; and the &quot;Young Writers Prize&quot; for one of the best books written by an unpublished young writer. Regardless, Cioran later spoke negatively of it, saying &quot;it is a very poorly written book, without any style.&quot;

Successively, &quot;The Book of Delusions&quot; (1935), &quot;The Transfiguration of Romania&quot; (1936) and &quot;Tears and Saints&quot; (1937) were also published in Romania. &quot;Tears and Saints&quot; was &quot;incredibly poorly received&quot;, and after it was published, Cioran&#x27;s mother wrote him asking him to retract the book because it was causing her public embarrassment.

Although Cioran was never a member of the group, it was during this time in Romania that he began taking an interest in the ideas put forth by the Iron Guard—a far right organization whose nationalist ideology he supported until the early years of World War II, despite allegedly disapproving of their violent methods. Cioran would later denounce fascism, describing it in 1970 as &quot;the worst folly of my youth. If I am cured of one sickness, it is surely that one.&quot;

Cioran revised &quot;The Transfiguration of Romania&quot; heavily in its second edition released in the 1990s, eliminating numerous passages he considered extremist or &quot;pretentious and stupid&quot;. In its original form, the book expressed sympathy for totalitarianism, a view which was also present in various articles Cioran wrote at the time, and which aimed to establish &quot;urbanization and industrialization&quot; as &quot;the two obsessions of a rising people&quot;.

His early call for modernization was, however, hard to reconcile with the traditionalism of the Iron Guard. In 1934, he wrote, &quot;I find that in Romania the sole fertile, creative, and invigorating nationalism can only be one which does not just dismiss tradition, but also denies and defeats it&quot;. Disapproval of what he viewed as specifically Romanian traits had been present in his works (&quot;In any maxim, in any proverb, in any reflection, our people expresses the same shyness in front of life, the same hesitation and resignation... [...] Everyday Romanian [truisms] are dumbfounding.&quot;), which led to criticism from the far-right &quot;Gândirea&quot; (its editor, Nichifor Crainic, had called &quot;The Transfiguration of Romania&quot; &quot;a bloody, merciless, massacre of today&#x27;s Romania, without even [the fear] of matricide and sacrilege&quot;), as well as from various Iron Guard papers.

===France===

After returning from Berlin in 1936, Cioran taught philosophy at the Andrei Șaguna High School in Brașov for a year. His classes were marked by confusion and he quit in a year.

In 1937, he first applied for a fellowship at the Spanish Embassy in Bucharest but then the Spanish Civil War started. Then he left for Paris with a scholarship from the French Institute branch in Bucharest, which was then prolonged until 1944. He was supposedly working towards a doctoral thesis in the Sorbonne University, but he had no intention to actually work towards it, as the identity of being a student gave him access to cheap meals at the university cafeteria. This he continued until 1951 when a law passed that forbade enrollment of students older than 27.

After a short stay in his home country (November 1940 – February 1941), Cioran never returned again. This last period in Romania was the one in which he exhibited a closer relationship with the Iron Guard, which by then had taken power (&quot;see National Legionary State&quot;). On 28 November, for the state-owned Romanian Radio, Cioran recorded a speech centered on the portrait of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, former leader of the movement, praising him and the Guard for, among other things, &quot;having given Romanians a purpose&quot;.

He later renounced not only his support for the Iron Guard, but also their nationalist ideas, and frequently expressed regret and repentance for his emotional implication in it. For example, in a 1972 interview, he condemned it as &quot;a complex of movements; more than this, a demented sect and a party&quot;, saying, &quot;I found out then [...] what it means to be carried by the wave without the faintest trace of conviction. [...] I am now immune to it&quot;.

Cioran started writing &quot;The Passionate Handbook&quot; in 1940 and finished it by 1945. It was the last book he wrote in Romanian, though not the last to deal with pessimism and misanthropy through lyrical aphorisms. Cioran published books only in French thereafter. It was at this point that Cioran&#x27;s apparent contempt for the Romanian people emerged. He told a friend that he &quot;wanted to write a &quot;Philosophy of Failure&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;For the exclusive use of the Romanian People&quot;&quot;. Furthermore, he described his move to Paris as &quot;by far the most intelligent thing&quot; he had ever done, and in &quot;The Trouble with Being Born&quot; he says, &quot;In continual rebellion against my ancestry, I have spent my whole life wanting to be something else: Spanish, Russian, cannibal—anything, except what I was.&quot;

In 1942, Cioran met Simone Boué, another insomniac, with whom he lived for the rest of his life. Cioran kept their relationship entirely private, and never spoke of his relationship with Boué in his writings or interviews.

In 1949, his first French book, &quot;A Short History of Decay&quot;, was published by Gallimard and was awarded the &quot;Prix Rivarol&quot; in 1950 for the best book written by a non-French author. Throughout his career, Cioran refused most literary prizes awarded to him.

== Later life and death ==
The Latin Quarter of Paris became Cioran&#x27;s permanent residence. He lived most of his life in seclusion, avoiding the public, but still maintained contact with numerous friends, including Mircea Eliade, Eugène Ionesco, Paul Celan, Samuel Beckett, Henri Michaux and Fernando Savater.

In a 1986 interview, Cioran said he no longer smoked or drank coffee or alcohol, citing health reasons.

In 1995, Cioran died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery.

==Major themes and style==
Professing a lack of interest in conventional philosophy in his early youth, Cioran dismissed abstract speculation in favor of personal reflection and passionate lyricism. &quot;I invented nothing. I&#x27;ve been the one and only secretary of my own sensations,&quot; he later said.

Aphorisms make up a large portion of Cioran&#x27;s bibliography, and some of his books, such as &quot;The Trouble with Being Born&quot;, are composed entirely of aphorisms. Speaking about this decision, Cioran said:

Philosophical pessimism characterizes all of his works, which many critics trace back to events of his childhood (in 1935 his mother is reputed to have told him that if she had known he was going to be so unhappy she would have aborted him). However, Cioran&#x27;s pessimism (in fact, his skepticism, even nihilism) remains both inexhaustible and, in its own particular manner, joyful; it is not the sort of pessimism which can be traced back to simple origins, single origins themselves being questionable. When Cioran&#x27;s mother spoke to him of abortion, he confessed that it did not disturb him, but made an extraordinary impression which led to an insight about the nature of existence (&quot;I&#x27;m simply an accident. Why take it all so seriously?&quot; is what he later said in reference to the incident).

His works often depict an atmosphere of torment, a state that Cioran himself experienced, and came to be dominated by lyricism and, often, the expression of intense and even violent feeling. The books he wrote in Romanian especially display this latter characteristic. Preoccupied with the problems of death and suffering, he was attracted to the idea of suicide, believing it to be an idea that could help one go on living, an idea which he fully explored in &quot;On the Heights of Despair&quot;. He revisits suicide in depth in &quot;The New Gods&quot;, which contains a section of aphorisms devoted to the subject. The theme of human alienation, the most prominent existentialist theme, presented by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, is thus formulated, in 1932, by young Cioran: &quot;Is it possible that existence is our exile and nothingness our home?&quot; in &quot;On the Heights of Despair&quot;.

Cioran&#x27;s works encompass many other themes as well: original sin, the tragic sense of history, the end of civilization, the refusal of consolation through faith, the obsession with the absolute, life as an expression of man&#x27;s metaphysical exile, etc. He was a thinker passionate about history; widely reading the writers that were associated with the &quot;Decadent movement&quot;. One of these writers was Oswald Spengler who influenced Cioran&#x27;s political philosophy in that he offered Gnostic reflections on the destiny of man and civilization. According to Cioran, as long as man has kept in touch with his origins and hasn&#x27;t cut himself off from himself, he has resisted decadence. Today, he is on his way to his own destruction through self-objectification, impeccable production and reproduction, excess of self-analysis and transparency, and artificial triumph.

Regarding God, Cioran has noted that &quot;without Bach, God would be a complete second-rate figure&quot; and that &quot;Bach&#x27;s music is the only argument proving the creation of the Universe cannot be regarded as a complete failure&quot;. Cioran went on to say &quot;Bach, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Dostoevsky and Nietzsche are the only arguments against monotheism.&quot;

William H. Gass called Cioran&#x27;s &quot;The Temptation to Exist&quot; &quot;a philosophical romance on the modern themes of alienation, absurdity, boredom, futility, decay, the tyranny of history, the vulgarities of change, awareness as agony, reason as disease&quot;.

According to Susan Sontag, Cioran&#x27;s subject is &quot;on being a mind, a consciousness tuned to the highest pitch of refinement&quot; and &quot;[i]n Cioran&#x27;s writings... the mind is a voyeur. But not upon &#x27;the world.&#x27; Upon itself. Cioran is, to a degree reminiscent of Beckett, concerned with the absolute integrity of thought. That is, with the reduction or circumscription of thought to thinking about thinking.&quot;

Cioran became most famous while writing not in Romanian but French, a language with which he had struggled since his youth. During Cioran&#x27;s lifetime, Saint-John Perse called him &quot;the greatest French writer to honor our language since the death of Paul Valéry.&quot; Cioran&#x27;s tone and usage in his adopted language were seldom as harsh as in Romanian (though his use of Romanian is said to be more original).

==Legacy==
After the death of Cioran&#x27;s long-term companion, Simone Boué, a collection of Cioran&#x27;s manuscripts (over 30 notebooks) were found in the couple&#x27;s apartment by a manager who tried to auction them in 2005. A decision taken by the Court of Appeal of Paris stopped the commercial sale of the collection. However, in March 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled that the seller was the legitimate owner of the manuscripts. The manuscripts were purchased by Romanian businessman George Brăiloiu for €405,000.

An aged Cioran is the main character in a play by Romanian dramatist-actor Matei Vișniec, (&quot;A Paris Loft with a View on Death&quot;). The play, depicting an imaginary meeting between Vișniec and Cioran, was first brought to the stage in 2007, under the direction of Radu Afrim and with a cast of Romanian and Luxembourgian actors; Cioran was played by Constantin Cojocaru. Stagings were organized in the Romanian city of Sibiu and in Luxembourg, at Esch-sur-Alzette (both Sibiu and Luxembourg City were the year&#x27;s European Capital of Culture). In 2009, the Romanian Academy granted posthumous membership to Cioran.

Susan Sontag was a great admirer of Cioran, calling him &quot;one of the most delicate minds of real power writing today.&quot; She wrote an essay on his work that served as the introduction to the English translation of &quot;The Temptation to Exist&quot;, published in 1967. The essay was included in Sontag&#x27;s 1969 collection &quot;Styles of Radical Will.&quot;

Under the rule of Nicolae Ceaușescu, Cioran&#x27;s works were banned. In 1974, Francoist Spain banned &quot;The Evil Demiurge&quot; for being &quot;atheist, blasphemous, and anti-Christian&quot;, which Cioran considered &quot;one of the greatest jokes in his absurd existence.&quot;

American electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never named a song after Cioran on his 2009 release &quot;Zones Without People&quot;.

<text>Gamla Uppsala (, &quot;Old Uppsala&quot;) is a parish and a village outside Uppsala in Sweden. It had 17,973 inhabitants in 2016.

As early as the 3rd century AD and the 4th century AD and onwards, it was an important religious, economic and political centre. Early written sources show that already during prehistory, Gamla Uppsala was widely famous in Northern Europe as the residence of Swedish kings of the legendary Yngling dynasty. In fact, the oldest Scandinavian sources, such as &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, the &quot;Westrogothic law&quot; and the &quot;Gutasaga&quot; talk of the King of the Swedes (Suiones) as the &quot;King at Uppsala&quot;. It was the main centre of the Swedes.

During the Middle Ages, it was the largest village of Uppland, the eastern part of which probably originally formed the core of the complex of properties belonging to the Swedish Crown, the so-called Uppsala öd, of which the western part consisted of the royal estate itself, &quot;kungsgården&quot;.

It was also the location of the Thing of all Swedes which was a thing (general assembly) held from prehistoric times to the Middle Ages, at the end of February or early March.
It was held in conjunction with a great fair called Disting, and a Norse religious celebration called Dísablót.
The &quot;Law of Uppland&quot; says that it was at this assembly that the king proclaimed that the fleet levy would be summoned for warfare during the summer, and all the crews, rowers, commanders and ships were decided.

It was not only the Norse cultic centre, it also became Sweden&#x27;s archbishopric in 1164.

==Geographical description==
Gamla Uppsala lies on Fyris Wolds, a cultivated plain in the valley of the River Fyris which is densely populated in its southern part, while the northern part consists of farms.

==Religious importance==
Medieval Scandinavians held Gamla Uppsala as one of the oldest and most important locations in Scandinavia. The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus held Odin himself to have resided in Gamla Uppsala far back in the mists of time:

At this time there was one Odin, who was credited over all Europe with the honour, which was false, of godhead, but used more continually to sojourn at Uppsala; and in this spot, either from the sloth of the inhabitants or from its own pleasantness, he vouchsafed to dwell with somewhat especial constancy.

This tradition was also known by the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, who, however had Odin reside in nearby Fornsigtuna, whereas the god Freyr lived in Gamla Uppsala. Freyr is also said to have founded two of the central institutions of Iron Age Sweden, the Uppsala öd and the Temple at Uppsala:
Frey took the kingdom after Njord, and was called drot by the Swedes, and they paid taxes to him. He was, like his father, fortunate in friends and in good seasons. Frey built a great temple at Uppsala, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land, and goods. Then began the Upsal domains, which have remained ever since.

Saxo Grammaticus adds that Freyr began the human sacrifices at Gamla Uppsala:

Also Frey, the regent of the gods, took his abode not far from Uppsala, where he exchanged for a ghastly and infamous sin-offering the old custom of prayer by sacrifice, which had been used by so many ages and generations. For he paid to the gods abominable offerings, by beginning to slaughter human victims.

The sacrifices at the Temple at Uppsala are described by Adam of Bremen:

At this point I shall say a few words about the religious beliefs of the Swedes. That nation has a magnificent temple, which is called Uppsala, located not far from the city of Sigtuna. In this temple, built entirely of gold, the people worship the statues of three gods.

A general festival for all the provinces of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is required of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows: Of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods.

Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred to the people that the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian told me that he had seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is better not to speak of them.

In the &quot;scolia&quot;, there is an additional description:
Near that temple is a very large tree with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.

The 16th century Johannes Magnus, the Archbishop of Uppsala, asserted that the city was anciently founded by, and named for, an early Swedish king named &quot;Ubbo&quot; (Uppsala = Ubbo&#x27;s Hall), who would have supposedly reigned . However, in the absence of any corroborating evidence, Magnus&#x27; accounts no longer enjoy widespread acceptance among scholars today.

It was a symbolic moment when Pope John Paul II visited Scandinavia in 1989 and held an open-air mass at the royal mounds in Gamla Uppsala, as this was a Norse religion cultic centre, which became Sweden&#x27;s first archbishopric in 1164.

In 2000, the Swedish AsatruSociety restarted the tradition of holding blóts at Gamla Uppsala.

==History==

It is a testimony to the sanctity of the location in the mindset of followers of medieval Norse religion that Gamla Uppsala was the last stronghold of pre-Christian, Norse Germanic kingship. During the 1070s and 1080s there appears to have been a renaissance of Norse religion with the magnificent Temple at Uppsala described in a contested account through an eye-witness by Adam of Bremen. Adam of Bremen relates of the Uppsala of the 1070s and describes it as a pagan cult centre with the enormous Temple at Uppsala containing wooden statues of Odin, Thor and Freyr.

Sometime in the 1080s the Christian king Ingi was exiled for refusing to perform the sacrifices. Instead Blot-Sweyn was elected, but he was killed by Ingi who could then reclaim his throne.

Its great importance in Swedish tradition led to the location of Sweden&#x27;s first Archbishopric in Gamla Uppsala in 1164. In practice, however, it had lost its strategic importance when it gradually lost ready access to navigable waters as the land rose owing to the constant post-glacial rebound.

==Archaeology==

People have been buried in Gamla Uppsala for 2,000 years, since the area rose above water. Originally there were between 2,000 and 3,000 mounds in the area but most have become farmland, gardens and quarries. Today only 250 barrows remain.

In the parish there are more than 1,000 preserved archaeological remains, but many more have been removed by agriculture. There are cairns of splintered stone that reveal that the area was settled during the Nordic Bronze Age, but most of the grave fields are from the Iron Age and the Viking Age.

The great grave field south of the Royal Mounds is from the Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age. Near the vicarage, a few unburnt graves from the Viking Age have been excavated.

Under the present church in Gamla Uppsala have been found the remains of one or several large wooden buildings. Some archaeologists believe that they are the remains of the Temple of Uppsala, while others hold that comes from an early Christian wooden church. Churches were often built on pre-Christian sacred sites, though.

Adjacent to the present church there is a plateau of clay, the &quot;Plateau of the Royal Estate&quot; (&quot;Kungsgårdsplatån&quot;), on which archaeologists have found the remains of a large hall.

==The Royal Mounds==

The Royal Mounds (Swedish: &quot;Kungshögarna&quot;) is the name of the three large barrows located in Gamla Uppsala. According to folklore, the three gods Thor, Odin and Freyr would be at rest in &quot;Kungshögarna&quot; or &quot;Uppsala högar&quot; (from the Old Norse word &quot;Haugr&quot; meaning mound or barrow; cognate English &quot;Howe&quot;). In the 19th and 20th centuries, they were speculated to hold the remains of three kings of the semi-legendary House of Ynglings and were thus known as &quot;Aun&#x27;s Mound&quot;, &quot;Adils&#x27;s Mound&quot; and &quot;Egil&#x27;s Mound&quot;. Today their geographical locations are used instead and they are called the &quot;Eastern Mound&quot;, &quot;Middle Mound&quot; and &quot;Western Mound&quot;.

They are dated to the 5th and 6th centuries. As Sweden&#x27;s oldest national symbols they are even depicted on the covers of books about the Swedish national identity. In the 6th century, Gamla Uppsala was the location of royal burials. The location was chosen carefully and in order to make them majestic. The tumuli were constructed on top of the ridge.

By burning the dead king and his armour, he was moved to Valhalla by the consuming force of the fire. The fire could reach temperatures of 1500 °C. The remains were covered with cobblestones and then a layer of gravel and sand and finally a thin layer of turf.

Thus he (Odin) established by law that all dead men should be burned, and their belongings laid with them upon the pile, and the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth. Thus, said he, every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had with him upon the pile; and he would also enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth. For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom remained long after Odin&#x27;s time. [...] It was their faith that the higher the smoke arose in the air, the higher he would be raised whose pile it was; and the richer he would be, the more property that was consumed with him.
:—Ynglinga saga

===An old controversy and its solution===
In the 1830s, some scholars claimed that the mounds were pure natural formations and not barrows. This affront to ancient Swedish national symbols could not be accepted by the future Swedish king Karl XV and in order to remove any doubt, he decided to start an excavation.

The task was given to Bror Emil Hildebrand, the director-general of the National Archives. In 1846, he undertook the excavation of the nine-metres-tall (30 ft) &quot;Eastern mound&quot; with the hope of finding the grave of a Swedish king of old.

====The eastern mound====

The excavation was complex and generated a lot of publicity. A tunnel was dug into the mound, where they found a pot of clay filled with burnt bones and around it there were the remains of the charred grave offerings.

Among the most important finds in the eastern mound were many fragments of decorated bronze panels with a dancing warrior carrying a spear. These panels have probably adorned a helmet of the Vendel Age type, common in Uppland (the only foreign examples being the Sutton Hoo and Staffordshire helmets). There were also finds of gold which probably had adorned a scramasax, but according to another interpretation, they were part of a belt. The dead was also given several glass beakers, a tafl game, a comb and a hone.

Most scholars agree that the mound was either raised for a woman or for a young man and a woman as the remains of a woman and boy were found. Hildebrand reburied most of the remains, so a new excavation will need to be undertaken before the controversy can be settled. What is quite certain is that the dead belonged to a royal dynasty.

====The western mound====

In 1874, Hildebrand started an excavation of the western mound and opened an enormous shaft right into the cairn in the centre of the mound. Under the cobble stones, there were the charred remains of the funeral fire.

In the western mound were found the remains of a man and animals, probably for food during the journey. The remains of a warrior&#x27;s equipment were found. Luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a board game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a sumptuous buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. The finds show the distant contacts of the people of Uppland in the 6th century.

==Gamla Uppsala Church==
Gamla Uppsala Church (&quot;Gamla Uppsala kyrka&quot;) was the seat of the Archbishopric of Sweden prior to 1273, when the seat was moved to Östra Aros (Östra Aros was then renamed Uppsala due to a papal request). The old cathedral was probably built in the 11th century, but finished in the 12th century. The stone building may have been preceded by a wooden church and probably by the large Temple at Uppsala. After a fire in 1240, the nave and transepts of the cathedral were removed, leaving only the choir and central tower, and with the addition of the sacristy and the porch gave the church its present outer appearance. In the 15th century, vaults were added as well as chalk paintings. Among the medieval wooden sculptures there are three crucifixes from the 12th, 13th and 15th centuries.

Archbishop Valerius was buried here. King Eric IX of Sweden was as well, before being moved to Uppsala Cathedral. Astronomer, physicist and mathematician Anders Celsius (1701–1744) was also buried at Gamla Uppsala Church next to his grandfather Magnus Celsius (1621–1679).

<text>In the Battle of Monterrey (September 21–24, 1846) during the Mexican–American War, General Pedro de Ampudia and the Mexican Army of the North was defeated by the Army of Occupation, a force of United States Regulars, Volunteers, and Texas Rangers under the command of General Zachary Taylor.

The hard-fought urban combat led to heavy casualties on both sides. The battle ended with both sides negotiating a two-month armistice and the Mexican forces being allowed to make an orderly evacuation in return for the surrender of the city.

==Background==
Following the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, Taylor crossed the Rio Grande on 18 May, while in early June, Mariano Arista turned over command of what remained of his army, 2,638 men, to Francisco Mejia, who led them to Monterrey. On 8 June, United States Secretary of War William L. Marcy ordered Taylor to continue command of operations in northern Mexico, suggested taking Monterrey, and defined his objective to &quot;dispose the enemy to desire an end to the war.&quot; On 8 August, Taylor established the headquarters for his Army of Occupation in Camargo, Tamaulipas and then in Cerralvo on 9 September with 6,640 men. Taylor resumed the march to Monterrey on 11 September, reaching Marin on 15 September and departing on 18 September

In early July, General Tomas Requena garrisoned Monterrey with 1,800 men, with the remnants of Arista&#x27;s army and additional forces from Mexico City arriving by the end of August such that the Mexican forces totaled 7,303 men. General Pedro de Ampudia received orders from Antonio López de Santa Anna to retreat further to the city of Saltillo, where Ampudia was to establish a defensive line, but Ampudia disagreed, sensing glory if he could stop Taylor&#x27;s advance. Ampudia&#x27;s forces included reinforcements from Mexico City totaling 3,140 men: 1,080 men of the Garcia-Conde Brigade (Gen. Jose Garcia Conde) (Aguascalientes and Querétaro Battalions, two squadrons of the 3d Line Cavalry, three guns (3-8 lbs)), a thousand men of the Azpeitia Brigade (Col. Florencio Azpeitia) (3d Line, two squadrons of the Jalisco lancers, two squadrons of the Guanajuato Cavalry Regiment, six guns (8 and 12 lbs.) and an ambulance), 1,060 men of the Simeon Ramirez Brigade (Acting Gen. Ramirez) (3d and 4th Light, three guns (1-8 lbs, 2-12 lbs) and 3 howitzers 7&quot; (Capt. P. Gutierrez and Comdte. A. Nieto)) and an artillery unit, the largely Irish-American volunteers called &quot;San Patricios&quot; (or the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion), in their first major engagement against U.S. forces.

==Battle==

Taylor&#x27;s army, with the Texas Division leading under the command of Major General and Texas Governor James Pinckney Henderson, reached the plain in front of Monterrey at 9am on the morning of 19 September, when they were fired upon by Col. José López Uraga&#x27;s 4th Infantry guns, located at San Patricio Battery atop the citadel. Taylor ordered the army to camp at Bosque de San Domingo while engineers under the command of Major Joseph K. Mansfield reconnoitered.

Besides the citadel, Mexican strong points within the city included the &quot;Black Fort&quot; (Col. Jose Lopez Uraga, 3d &amp; 4th Line and 9 guns – incl. &quot;San Patricio&quot; Battery); &quot;the Tannery,&quot; La Teneria, (2d Ligero under Col. José M. Carrasco and part of the Querétaro Battalion, and 2 guns &amp; 1 mountain howitzer – Lt (?) J. Espejo) El Fortín del Rincón del Diablo (Lt. Col. Calisto Bravo and 3 guns- Capt. Ignacio Joaquin del Arenal); La Purísima bridge and tete-de-pont (Activos of Aguascalientes under Col. Jose Ferro and the Querétaro under Comdte. José María Herrera 3 guns – Capt. P. Gutierez). West of the city atop Independencia stood Ft. Libertad ( 4 guns) and the Obispado (bishop&#x27;s place) with the Activos of Mexico commanded by Lt. Col. Francisco de Berra and 3 guns and 1 howitzer, and atop Federacion was a redan(2 guns) and Fort Soldado. In reserve at la Plaza was the 3d Ligero under Lt. Col. Juan Castro and 1 gun – Lt. Agustín Espinosa.

General Zachary Taylor decided to attack western Monterrey using William J. Worth&#x27;s Division in a giant north and west &quot;hook&quot; movement while simultaneously attacking with his main body from the east. Worth started at 2pm on 20 September with Col. John Coffee Hays&#x27;s Texas Mounted Riflemen Regiment screening the advance, but camped for the night three miles from the Saltillo road.

By 6am on 21 September, Worth continued his advance, repulsing a Jalisco cavalry charge by Col. Juan Nájera, killing the latter and an advance guard consisting of General Manuel Romero&#x27;s brigade and Lt. Col. Mariano Moret&#x27;s Guanajuato Regiment. By 8:15am, Worth had severed the Saltillo road from Monterrey and sent Capt. Charles F. Smith with 300 infantry and Texans, plus Capt. Dixon Miles&#x27;s 7th Infantry and Persifor Smith&#x27;s 2nd Brigade to take Federacion and Fort Soldado, which they quickly did.

In the meantime, Taylor launched a diversion against eastern Monterrey with Col. John Garland&#x27;s 1st and 3d Infantry plus Lt. Col. William H. Watson&#x27;s Maryland and District of Columbia Battalion, which quickly grew into an assault. By 8am, Capt. Electus Backus&#x27;s company of the 1st Infantry had taken the tannery and by noon, with Col. William B. Campbell&#x27;s 1st Tennessee and Mississippi Rifles, had taken Fort de La Teneria.

No attacks or sorties occurred on 22 September.

At 3am on 23 September, Worth sent the Texas Rangers and the 4th and 8th Infantry, under Lt. Col. Thomas Childs, to take Fort Libertad on Independencia, which they did by daybreak. With the help of James Duncan&#x27;s battery, they soon took the Obispado and had control of western Monterrey. By then, the Mexicans had abandoned their outer defenses on the east side of Monterrey, concentrating in the Plaza Mayor, and John A. Quitman&#x27;s brigade held eastern Monterrey by 11am.

During the exchange of fire, a young Mexican woman named María Josefa Zozaya wandered into the crossfire to tend to the wounds of injured soldiers of both armies. Maria would survive the battle and go on to marry and have six children. Maria would die in 1860 at the age of 38.
By 2pm on 23 September, General Worth advanced into the city from the west, burrowing house to house, supported in the late afternoon by a mortar set up in Plaza de la Capella, and were within a block west of the plaza by 11pm. The Texan volunteers taught the U.S. regulars new techniques for fighting in the city, techniques that they did not employ on 21 September, which led to staggering casualties. Armed with these new urban warfare skills, the U.S. Army, along with Texan, Mississippian, and Tennessee volunteers moved house to house, rooting out Mexican soldiers hiding on rooftops and inside the thick, adobe-walled houses of northern Mexico. By 2pm, Taylor and Quitman were within two blocks east of the plaza when Taylor ordered a withdrawal before nightfall.

General Ampudia decided to negotiate on 24 September. Taylor negotiated a two-month armistice, along the line Rinconada Pass-Linares-San Fernando de Parras, in return for the surrender of the city. The Mexican Army was allowed to march from the city from 26 to 28 September, with their personal arms and one field battery of six guns.

==Aftermath==

Ampudia had moved beyond the armistice line by 30 September and San Luis Potosi by early November.

The resulting armistice signed between Taylor and Ampudia had major effects upon the outcome of the war. Taylor was lambasted by some in the federal government, where President James K. Polk insisted that the U.S. Army had no authority to negotiate truces, only to &quot;kill the enemy.&quot; In addition, his terms of armistice, which allowed Ampudia&#x27;s forces to retreat with battle honors and all of their weapons, were seen as foolish and short-sighted by some U.S. observers.
For his part, some have argued that Ampudia had begun the defeat of Mexico. Many Mexican soldiers became disenchanted with the war. In a well-fortified, well-supplied position, an army of ten thousand Mexican soldiers had resisted the U.S. Army for three days, only to be forced into surrender by American urban battle tactics, heavy artillery and possibly further division in the Mexican ranks.

The invading army occupied the city and remained until June 18, 1848. As soon as the occupation occurred, the U.S. Army committed several executions of civilians and several women were raped. Among the most memorable massacres is the one reported by the Houston Telegraph and Register on January 4, 1847 when Texas volunteers blamed the Mexicans for the death of several of their companions in Monterrey. Consequently, Americans began to shoot all civilians they encountered. The newspaper, citing military sources reported more than fifty civilians killed in Monterrey in a single event. Similar acts of violence occurred in other surrounding occupied towns such as Marín (which was destroyed and set on fire), Apodaca as well as other towns between the Rio Grande and Monterrey. In most cases those attacks were perpetrated by the Texas Rangers. Several American volunteers condemned the attacks, and blamed the Texas Rangers for committing hate crimes on civilians allegedly for revenge of the former Mexican campaigns in Texas. Before and after the US occupation, a large number of civilians fled the city. In response to the occupation several local guerrilla groups emerged such as those led by Antonio Canales Rosillo and José Urrea, the latter widely repudiated by the Texans because of his leadership participation in the campaigns of the Texas War ten years earlier. Taylor admitted the atrocities committed by his men, but took no action to punish them.

<text>The vacuum brake is a braking system employed on trains and introduced in the mid-1860s. A variant, the automatic vacuum brake system, became almost universal in British train equipment and in countries influenced by British practice. Vacuum brakes also enjoyed a brief period of adoption in the United States, primarily on narrow-gauge railroads. Their limitations caused them to be progressively superseded by compressed air systems starting in the United Kingdom from the 1970s onward. The vacuum brake system is now obsolete; it is not in large-scale usage anywhere in the world, other than in South Africa, largely supplanted by air brakes.

==Introduction==
In the earliest days of railways, trains were slowed or stopped by the application of manually applied brakes on the locomotive and in brake vehicles through the train, and later by steam power brakes on locomotives. This was clearly unsatisfactory, given the slow and unreliable response times (each brake being separately applied by a member of the train crew in response to signals from the driver, which they might miss for any number of reasons, and necessarily in sequence rather than all at once where there were more brakes than crew members, making emergency braking extremely hit-and-miss) and extremely limited braking power that could be exerted (most vehicles in the train being wholly unbraked, and the power of all but the locomotive&#x27;s own brakes relying on the strength of a particular crewmember&#x27;s arm on a screw handle), but the existing technology did not offer an improvement. A chain braking system was developed, requiring a chain to be coupled throughout the train, but it was impossible to arrange equal braking effort along the entire train.

A major advance was the adoption of a vacuum braking system, in which flexible pipes were connected between all the vehicles of the train, and brakes on each vehicle could be controlled from the locomotive. The earliest scheme was a simple vacuum brake, in which vacuum was created by operation of a valve on the locomotive; the vacuum actuated brake pistons on each vehicle, and the degree of braking could be increased or decreased by the driver. Vacuum, rather than compressed air, was preferred because steam locomotives can be fitted with ejectors; venturi devices that create vacuum without moving parts.

The simple vacuum system had the major defect that in the event of one of the hoses connecting the vehicles becoming displaced (by the train accidentally dividing, or by careless coupling of the hoses, or otherwise) the vacuum brake on the entire train was useless.

In response to this obvious defect, the automatic vacuum brake was subsequently developed. It was designed to apply fully if the train became divided or if a hose became displaced. The automatic vacuum brake was slightly more expensive to manufacture and install than the simple system due to it requiring a higher number of machined parts, and incurred higher running costs since the ejector ran continuously (at a cost in steam and thus fuel and water) to maintain the vacuum when the train was running, rather than only being used when braking as in the simple system.

Opposition to the fitting of the automatic type of brake on the grounds of cost (particularly by the LNWR and its chairman Richard Moon - as one of the largest British companies, the refusal of the LNWR to adopt the automatic brake was a strong factor against its wider use by other companies, especially those interchanging traffic with the North Western) meant that it took a serious accident at Armagh in 1889 before legislation compelled the adoption of the automatic system. In this accident at Armagh, a portion of a train was detached from the locomotive on a steep gradient and ran away, killing 80 people. The train was fitted with the simple vacuum brake, which was useless on the disconnected portion of the train. It was clear that if the vehicles had been fitted with an automatic continuous brake, the accident would almost certainly not have happened, and the public concern at the scale of the accident prompted legislation mandating the use of a continuous automatic brake on all passenger trains.

In continental Europe, the vacuum brake was sometimes called the Hardy brake, after John George Hardy of the Vacuum Brake Co, 7 Hohenstaufengasse, Vienna.

== Operation ==
In its simplest form, the automatic vacuum brake consists of a continuous pipe—the train pipe—running throughout the length of the train. In normal running a partial vacuum is maintained in the train pipe, and the brakes are released. When air is admitted to the train pipe, the air at atmospheric pressure acts against pistons in cylinders in each vehicle. A vacuum is sustained on the other face of the pistons, so that a net force is applied. A mechanical linkage transmits this force to brake shoes which act on the treads of the wheels.

The fittings to achieve this are:
* a train pipe: a steel pipe running the length of each vehicle, with flexible vacuum hoses at each end of the vehicles, and coupled between adjacent vehicles; at the end of the train, the final hose is seated on an air-tight plug;
* an ejector on the locomotive, to create vacuum in the train pipe;
* controls for the driver to bring the ejector into action, and to admit air to the train pipe; these may be separate controls or a combined brake valve;
* a brake cylinder on each vehicle containing a piston, connected by rigging to the brake shoes on the vehicle; and
* a vacuum (pressure) gauge on the locomotive to indicate to the driver the degree of vacuum in the train pipe.

The brake cylinder is contained in a larger housing—this gives a reserve of vacuum as the piston operates. The cylinder rocks slightly in operation to maintain alignment with the brake rigging cranks, so it is supported in trunnion bearings, and the vacuum pipe connection to it is flexible. The piston in the brake cylinder has a flexible piston ring that allows air to pass from the upper part of the cylinder to the lower part if necessary.

When the vehicles have been at rest, so that the brake is not charged, the brake pistons will have dropped to their lower position in the absence of a pressure differential (as air will have leaked slowly into the upper part of the cylinder, destroying the vacuum).

When a locomotive is coupled to the vehicles, the driver moves the brake control to the &quot;release&quot; position and air is exhausted from the train pipe, creating a partial vacuum. Air in the upper part of the brake cylinders is also exhausted from the train pipe, through a non-return ball valve.

If the driver now moves his control to the &quot;brake&quot; position, air is admitted to the train pipe. According to the driver&#x27;s manipulation of the control, some or all of the vacuum will be destroyed in the process. The ball valve closes and there is a higher air pressure under the brake pistons than above it, and the pressure differential forces the piston upwards, applying the brakes. The driver can control the amount of braking effort by admitting more or less air to the train pipe.

== Practical considerations ==
The automatic vacuum brake as described represented a considerable technical advance in train braking. In practice steam locomotives had two ejectors, a small ejector for running purposes (to maintain the partial vacuum at the correct level against inevitable slight air leaks in the train pipe and its connections) and a large ejector to release brake applications. The small ejector used much less steam than the large ejector but could not generate vacuum in the train pipe sufficiently quickly for operational purposes, especially in a long train. Later Great Western Railway practice was to use a vacuum pump instead of the small ejector – the pump was fitted to one of the engine crossheads and so did not use any steam, with the disadvantage that it only operated when the locomotive was in motion. The GWR favoured this due to the use of braking systems working on a vacuum level higher than other railways (see below) which would have required a relatively large and steam-hungry &quot;small&quot; ejector.
Most steam locomotives of the period used straightforward live steam brakes on their own wheels (where steam pressure was let into the brake cylinders to apply the brakes), with the vacuum brake being solely used on the train. In such a case the two systems were usually operated proportionately by a single control, whereby the reduction in vacuum in the train brake system would open the valve feeding steam to the engine brake. It was unusual for any form of dedicated control to be provided solely for the steam brake – even when running with no train the driver controlled the engine&#x27;s steam brakes by adjusting the vacuum brake system using the ejectors on the engine and the &quot;head end&quot; of the train pipe. This allowed the driver of the lead engine direct control over the brakes on any trailing locomotive (as well as the train itself) when double heading.

With the introduction of diesel and electric locomotives by British Railways from the early 1950s, this same basic arrangement was carried over. BR&#x27;s Modernisation Plan of 1955 called for, amongst other things, a long-term aim to switch to air brakes for both passenger and freight stock. The standard Mark 1 coaching stock had been designed and procured before the decision to switch to modern traction and air brakes had been taken, so the majority of the stock was fitted with traditional vacuum brakes. Air-braked goods wagons were introduced steadily from the mid-1960s (starting with the HAA-type hoppers for the new &#x27;merry-go-round trains&#x27; trains) and the Mark 2a coaching stock with air brakes was built from 1967. Diesel and electric locomotives naturally could not use the traditional steam-driven ejector to generate vacuum. Smaller locomotives had exhausters or vacuum pumps driven directly by their prime mover while larger ones had similar machines mounted separately and driven by dedicated electric motors. It was normal practice on mainline locomotives to fit two exhausters (and two air compressors for the air brake system) for redundancy. Just as steam locomotives had a small and large ejector, the diesels and electrics (most of which had braking equipment supplied by either British Westinghouse or Davies and Metcalfe) had their brake controls set up to run one exhauster continuously to generate and maintain the vacuum in the system (analogous to the small ejector), with the second one being started when the brake handle was set to its &#x27;Release&#x27; position to provide a quicker response (the same function as the large ejector). A switch in the locomotive cab allowed the driver to choose which exhauster would serve each function.

Release valves are provided on the brake cylinders; when operated, usually by manually pulling a cord near the cylinder, air is admitted to the upper part of the brake cylinder on that vehicle. This is necessary to release the brake on a vehicle that has been uncoupled from a train and now requires to be moved without having a brake connection to another locomotive, for example if it is to be shunted.

In the UK the pre-nationalisation railway companies standardised around systems operating on a vacuum of , with the exception of the Great Western Railway, which used . Sea level air pressure is about , depending on atmospheric conditions.

This difference in standards could cause problems on long-distance cross-country services when a GWR locomotive was replaced with another company&#x27;s engine, as the new engine&#x27;s large ejector would sometimes not be able to fully release the brakes on the train. In this case the release valves on each vehicle in the train would have to be released by hand, before the brake was recharged at 21 inches. This time-consuming process was frequently seen at large GWR stations such as Bristol Temple Meads.

The provision of a train pipe running throughout the train enabled the automatic vacuum brake to be operated in emergency from any position in the train. Every guard&#x27;s compartment had a brake valve, and the passenger communication apparatus (usually called &quot;the communication cord&quot; in lay terminology) also admitted air into the train pipe at the end of coaches so equipped.

When a locomotive is first coupled to a train, or if a vehicle is detached or added, a brake continuity test is carried out, to ensure that the brake pipes are connected throughout the entire length of the train.

== Limitations ==
The progress represented by the automatic vacuum brake nonetheless carried some limitations; chief among these were:

* the practical limit on the degree of vacuum attainable means that a very large brake piston and cylinder are required to generate the force necessary on the brake blocks; when a proportion of the British ordinary wagon fleet was fitted with vacuum brakes in the 1950s, the physical dimensions of the brake cylinder prevented the wagons from operating in some private sidings that had tight clearances;
* for the same reason, on a very long train, a considerable volume of air has to be admitted to the train pipe to make a full brake application, and a considerable volume has to be exhausted to release the brake (if for example a signal at danger is suddenly cleared and the driver requires to resume speed); while the air is traveling along the train pipe, the brake pistons at the head of the train have responded to the brake application or release, but those at the tail will respond much later, leading to undesirable longitudinal forces in the train. In extreme cases this has led to breaking couplings and causing the train to divide.
* the existence of vacuum in the train pipe can cause debris to be sucked in. An accident took place near Ilford in the 1950s, due to inadequate braking effort in the train. A rolled newspaper was discovered in the train pipe, effectively isolating the rear part of the train from the driver&#x27;s control. The blockage should have been detected if a proper brake continuity test had been carried out before the train started its journey.

A development introduced in the 1950s was the direct admission valve, fitted to every brake cylinder. These valves responded to a rise in train pipe pressure as the brake was applied, and admitted atmospheric air directly to the underside of the brake cylinder.

American and continental European practice had long favoured compressed air brake systems, the leading pattern being a proprietary Westinghouse system. This has a number of advantages, including smaller brake cylinders (because higher air pressure could be used) and a somewhat more responsive braking effort. However, the system requires an air pump. On steam engines this was usually a reciprocating steam-driven compressor, which was quite bulky and much more complicated and maintenance-intensive than the vacuum ejector, which was compact and had no moving parts. The compressor&#x27;s distinctive shape and the characteristic puffing sound when the brake is released (as the train pipe has to be recharged with air) make steam locomotives fitted with the Westinghouse brake unmistakable. Another disadvantage of the earlier air brake systems (although later overcome) was that it was impossible to make a partial release. The vacuum brake can very simply be partially released by restoring some (but not all) of the vacuum, without having to fully release the brakes. The original air brake systems, on the other hand, did not allow this, the only way of partially releasing the brake being to fully release it, then re-apply it to the desired setting.

A corollary of this was that the standard vacuum brake system, as used between the 1860s and the 1940s, could not easily maintain a constant level of application. The driver could remove air from the train pipe using the ejector(s) or admit air using the brake valve but there was no way of setting the brake to a fixed level of vacuum between &#x27;zero&#x27; (atmospheric pressure) and the maximum vacuum-generating capabilities of the ejector (21-25inHg, see above). The only way to do so was to carefully balance the setting of the brake valve and the small ejector, which was difficult to achieve in practice and was not even possible on some systems which combined both into a single control. This meant that braking occurred through a series of controlled applications and releases – perfectly adequate to safely bring a train to a halt but requiring constant management to maintain a speed on a downhill gradient. By contrast even the earliest Westinghouse air brake systems could be &#x27;lapped&#x27; – the system would maintain the brakes at a constant level as set by the driver. Later vacuum brake systems as fitted to British Railways diesel and electric locomotives and multiple units in the 1950s used mechanically-driven exhausters or vacuum pumps which included regulator valves allowing the driver to set a desired vacuum in the train pipe which would then be maintained by the system admitted or exhausting air as required.

In the UK, the Great Eastern Railway, the North Eastern Railway, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway and the Caledonian Railway adopted the Westinghouse compressed air system. It was also standard on the Isle of Wight rail system. This led to compatibility problems in exchanging traffic with other lines. It was possible to provide through pipes for the braking system not fitted to any particular vehicle so that it could run in a train using the &quot;other&quot; system, allowing through control of the fitted vehicles behind it, but with no braking effort of its own; or to fit vehicles with both braking systems. The Big Four companies formed in 1923 all chose to adopt the vacuum brake as the new standard for most rolling stock, with the same 21 InHg operating vacuum with the continuing exception of the GWR (and many electric multiple units introduced in this period used variations on the automatic air brake). A large proportion of the inherited air-braked stock had been retired or converted to vacuum operation by the outbreak of the Second World War and with the formation of British Railways in 1948 the 21 InHg vacuum brake system became the new standard. However, air-braked steam-hauled stock remained in service on the former Great Eastern Railway suburban lines from London Liverpool Street until the end of steam on the GE in 1962.

== Producing the vacuum ==
=== Ejectors ===

Vacuum brakes were initially favoured over air brakes because of the ease of producing the vacuum. A vacuum ejector was a simpler and more reliable device, compared to the reciprocating pump.

Typically two ejectors are fitted, large and small. The large ejector is used to &#x27;blow off&#x27; the brakes, by producing the vacuum, and is then shut off. The small ejector is left running continuously in order to maintain it. The Gresham &amp; Craven &#x27;Dreadnought&#x27; ejector was a combination ejector, with both large and small ejectors within the same body. The vacuum produced depended on the total number of vehicles in the train and the sum of their various minor leaks. A train of stock due for maintenance could make it difficult to maintain a vacuum, even requiring intermittent use of the large ejector when running. The widely used Super-Dreadnought ejector combined a large ejector with two small ejectors in one. If needed, two of the smaller nozzles could produce more vacuum, yet were more efficient in their use of steam then a single larger nozzle.

The Great Western Railway was noted for its idiosyncrasies, including the use of a higher brake vacuum than other lines. To maintain this without excessive steam consumption in an ejector, they also favoured the use of a crosshead-driven mechanical pump.

=== Exhausters ===
Diesel locomotives were introduced at a time when vacuum brakes were still widespread. Ejectors are not practical and so mechanical pumps or &#x27;exhausters&#x27; are used instead. These are a small rotary vane pump, similar to some forms of vacuum pump. The body is a cylindrical metal casting with a cylindrical rotor within it, but the two axes are offset. The rotor contains a number of sliding vanes, typically six. As the rotor is rotated, the vanes are held against the walls of the cylindrical body. Entry and exit ports at the top and bottom of the cylinder, where the rotor is furthest from and nearest to the wall, provide a vacuum pumping effect. The vanes are held against the cylinder by an internal cam ring or by springs. They are lubricated by an oil feed into the exhauster. As the exhauster is oil-lubricated, the exhaust air is full of oil droplets and so passes through an oil separator before being exhausted to the atmosphere. A simple check valve on the inlet prevents backflow leakage, if the exhauster stops.

Compared to the compressor of an air brake, the exhauster is a simpler and more reliable device. It has no valves, so fewer moving parts. There is no pressure control, as vacuum pumping is self-limiting. The exhauster runs cooler as there is little compression of the pumped air. The pump seals are simpler, owing to the lower pressure, and there are no piston rings with a risk of sticking.

Exhausters are typically engine-driven, and run continuously. If there are two engines in a locomotive or railcar, two exhausters are usually fitted. They are cheap devices, extra pumping capacity can help to release the brakes more quickly and their redundancy reduces the risk of a failure causing a failed train. On electric locomotives, the exhausters are electrically driven.

Some of the first diesel-engined buses and coaches between the 1930s and 1950s also used engine-driven exhausters. They were designed with vacuum braking systems or servo-assisted brakes, based on earlier models with petrol engines. As petrol engines produce a manifold vacuum, vacuum systems are easily added. Diesel engines have no throttle or manifold venturi, thus do not provide a usable vacuum source. Trucks and later buses used compressor-driven air brakes instead.

== Dual brakes ==
Vehicles can be fitted with dual brakes, vacuum and air, provided that there is room to fit the duplicated equipment. In a dual fitted vehicle, there would be both a vacuum cylinder and one or more air brake cylinders, all operating on the same set of rigging to apply the brakes at the vehicle wheels. Some of BR&#x27;s Mk1 coaches were built with dual brakes (all had vacuum as standard) and much of the rest of the fleet was dual fitted by the 1980s, so they could be worked by air or vacuum fitted locomotives as the changeover from vacuum to air took place between 1970 and the early 1990s.

On a smaller vehicle such as a traditional four-wheeled goods wagon, it is much easier to fit just one kind of brake with a pipe for continuity of the other. Train crew need to take note that the wrong-fitted wagons do not contribute to the braking effort and make allowances on down grades to suit. Many of the earlier classes of diesel locomotive used on British Railways (and electric locos up to and including the Class 86) were fitted with dual systems to enable full usage of BR&#x27;s rolling stock inherited from the private companies which had different systems depending on which company the stock originated from.

Air brakes need a tap to seal the hose at the ends of the train. If these taps are incorrectly closed, a loss of brake force may occur, leading to a dangerous runaway. With vacuum brakes, the end of the hose can be plugged into a stopper which seals the hose by suction. It is much harder to block the hose pipe compared to air brakes.

== Twin pipe systems ==
Vacuum brakes can be operated in a twin pipe mode to speed up applications and release. Twin pipe vacuum systems were standard on the first generation British Rail Diesel Multiple Units which replaced steam locomotive hauled passenger trains on many branch and secondary lines in the 1960s. The second &quot;high Vacuum &quot; pipe and associated reservoirs and valves were used as a means to increase the speed of the release of the brake. The vacuum exhausters on these units were mechanically driven by the engine; as the engine would normally only be idling when a brake release was required, release would have been extremely slow if the conventional single-pipe system had been employed. This problem did not occur on BR&#x27;s diesel locomotives, as their exhausters were electrically driven, and so could be run at high speed to release the brake irrespective of engine speed.

== Present-day use of vacuum brakes ==
Today&#x27;s largest operators of trains equipped with vacuum brakes are the Indian Railways and Spoornet (South Africa), however there are also trains with air brakes and dual brakes in use. South African Railways (Spoornet) operates more than 1 000 electric multiple unit cars, which are fitted with air compressed brakes. The electro-vacuum system uses a train pipe and basic automatic vacuum brake system, with the addition of electrically controlled application and release valves in each vehicle. The application and release valves greatly increase the rate of train pipe vacuum destruction and creation. This, in turn, greatly increases the speed of brake application and release. The performance of electro-vacuum brakes on SAR EMUs is equivalent to electro-pneumatic braked EMUs of a similar age.

Other African railways are believed to continue to use the vacuum brake. Other operators of vacuum brakes are narrow-gauge railways in Europe, the largest of which is the Rhaetian Railway.

Vacuum brakes have been entirely superseded on the National Rail system in the UK (with the British Rail Class 121 &quot;bubble cars&quot; being the last mainline trains to have vacuum brakes having been withdrawn in 2017), although they are still in use on most standard gauge heritage railways. They are also to be found on a diminishing number of main line vintage special trains.

Iarnród Éireann (the national rail operator in the Republic of Ireland) ran vacuum-braked British Railways Mark 2 stock on passenger trains until the end of March 2008 and still operates vacuum-braked revenue freight (at least in the case of Tara Mines ore traffic). All mainline heritage trains are run with vacuum brakes – the whole of Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s current locomotive fleet has both air and vacuum train brakes fitted.

The Isle of Man Railway uses vacuum brakes fitted to all its coaching and wagon stock, as do the Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways. Most other British narrow gauge lines use the air brake: this is because these railways were not required to fit continuous braking until the last quarter of the 20th century, by which time vacuum brake equipment was no longer being produced and was difficult to obtain.

== High altitude ==
Vacuum brakes are less effective at high altitude. This is because they depend upon the creation of a pressure differential; atmospheric pressure is lower at high altitudes, and so the maximum differential is also lower.

<doc id="251246" wikidata="Q1554038" url="?curid=251246" title="William Carleton">
<text>William Carleton (4 March 1794, Prolusk (often spelt as Prillisk as on his gravestone), Clogher, County Tyrone – 30 January 1869, Sandford Road, Ranelagh, Dublin) was an Irish writer and novelist. He is best known for his &quot;Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry&quot;, a collection of ethnic sketches of the stereotypical Irishman.

==Childhood==
Carleton&#x27;s father was a Roman Catholic tenant farmer, who supported fourteen children on as many acres, and young Carleton passed his early life among scenes similar to those he later described in his books. Carleton was steeped in folklore from an early age. His father, who had an extraordinary memory (he knew the bible by heart) and as a native Irish speaker, a thorough acquaintance with Irish folklore, told stories by the fireside. His mother, a noted singer, sang in Irish. The character of Honor, the miser&#x27;s wife, in &quot;Fardorougha&quot;, is said to be based on her.

Carleton received a basic education. As his father moved from one small farm to another, he attended various hedge schools, which used to be a notable feature of Irish life. A picture of one of these schools occurs in the sketch called &quot;The Hedge School&quot; included in &quot;Traits and Stories of Irish Peasantry&quot;. Most of his learning was gained from a curate, Father Keenan, who taught a classical school at Glennan (near Glaslough) in the parish of Donagh (County Monaghan) which Carleton attended from 1814 to 1816. He studied for the priesthood at Maynooth, but left after two years. Carleton had hoped to obtain an education as a poor scholar at Munster, with a view to entering the church; but he was shaken by an ominous dream, the story of which is told in the &quot;Poor Scholar&quot;, and he returned home. An amusing account of this period is given in the sketch, &quot;Denis O&#x27;Shaughnessy&quot;.

Aged about nineteen, he undertook one of the religious pilgrimages then common in Ireland. His experiences as a pilgrim, narrated in &quot;The Lough Derg Pilgrim,&quot; made him give up the thought of entering the church, and he eventually became a Protestant.

==Career==

His vacillating ideas as to a mode of life were determined by reading the picaresque novel &quot;Gil Blas&quot; (by Alain-René Lesage, 1668–1747). He decided to try what fortune had in store for him. He went to Killanny, County Louth. For six months he served as tutor to the family of a farmer named Piers Murphy. After some other experiments he set out for Dublin, arriving with two shillings and sixpence in his pocket.

He first sought occupation as a bird-stuffer, but a proposal to use potatoes and meal as stuffing failed to recommend him. He then tried to become a soldier, but the colonel of the regiment dissuaded him—Carleton had applied in Latin. After staying in a number of cheap lodgings, he eventually found a place in a house on Francis St., which contained a circulating library. The landlady allowed him to read from 12 to 16 hours a day. He obtained some teaching and a clerkship in a Sunday School office, began to contribute to journals, and &quot;The Pilgrimage to Lough Derg,&quot; which was published in the &quot;Christian Examiner&quot;, attracted great attention.

In 1830 he published his first full-length book, &quot;Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry&quot; (2 vols.), which made his name and is considered his best achievement. In it he stereotyped the Irish &quot;Paddy&quot; in sketches such as &quot;Phil Purcel The Pig Driver&quot;. A second series (3 vols.), containing, among other stories, &quot;Tubber Derg, or the Red Well&quot;, appeared in 1833, and &quot;Tales of Ireland&quot; in 1834. From that time till within a few years of his death he wrote constantly. &quot;Fardorougha the Miser, or the Convicts of Lisnamona&quot; appeared in 1837–1838 in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;.

Carleton remained active publishing in Dublin magazines through the 1830s and 40s writing many ethnic stories often drawn from the south Tyrone locality. He also wrote a lot of fiction but, as John Sutherland (1989) says, it was inferior to his ethnic sketches of the Irish type. During the last months of his life Carleton began an autobiography which he brought down to the beginning of his literary career. This forms the first part of &quot;The Life of William Carleton ...&quot; (2 vols., 1896), by David James O&#x27;Donoghue, which contains full information about his life, and a list of his scattered writings. A selection from his stories (1889), in the &quot;Camelot Series&quot;, has an introduction by William Butler Yeats.

The author&#x27;s later years were characterised by drunkenness and poverty, as one commentator said: &quot;he succeeded in offending everybody during the course of his life. In spite of his considerable literary production, Carleton remained poor, but received a pension in 1848 of £200 a year granted by Lord John Russell in response to a memorial on Carleton&#x27;s behalf signed by numbers of distinguished persons in Ireland.

He died at his home (now demolished) at Woodville, Sandford Road, in (Cullenswood) Ranelagh, Dublin, and is interred at Mount Jerome Cemetery, Harold&#x27;s Cross, Dublin. The house was close to the entrance to the Jesuit residence at Milltown Park. Despite his conversion to Protestantism, Carleton remained on friendly terms with one of the priests there, Reverend Robert Carbery SJ, who offered to give him the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. Carleton, in the final weeks before his death in January 1869, politely declined the offer, stating he had not been a Roman Catholic &quot;for half a century &amp; more&quot;.

==Controversial reputation==
Carleton alienated the sympathies of many Catholic Irishmen by his accusations of gang violence, sectarian violence, and alcoholism among the Irish tenant class. He was in his own words the &quot;historian of their habits and manners, their feelings, their prejudices, their superstitions and their crimes&quot; (Preface to &quot;Tales of Ireland&quot;). Some of his later stories, &quot;The Squanders of Castle Squander&quot; (1852) for instance, are spoiled by the mass of political matter in them.

===Anti-Catholicism===
Another factor that alienated Carleton from his fellow Irishmen was his intense hatred of the Catholic Church in Ireland to which the majority of his countrymen belonged. It has been argued (for example by Brian Donnelly) that Carleton&#x27;s conversion to Anglicanism may have been a pragmatic move, as it would have been difficult for an aspiring young Catholic author to receive the patronage necessary to achieve success in early 19th-century Ireland.

However, Donnelly&#x27;s arguments fail when compared to Carleton&#x27;s own statements in an 1826 letter to the Home Secretary, Sir Robert Peel. Carleton urged Peel to violently suppress Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s activism for Catholic Emancipation, and claimed to have proof of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s involvement in fomenting anti-Protestant and anti-Landlord violence, while also accusing every Roman Catholic priest and schoolmaster of the same crimes.

Shortly afterwards, Carleton befriended a Church of Ireland minister named Caesar Otway. According to W. B. Yeats, Reverend Otway was an, &quot;anti-papal controversialist,&quot; who encouraged Carleton to write stories to &quot;highlight...the corrupt practices of an ignorant clergy.&quot;

Frank O&#x27;Connor said that Carleton debased his talents by taking sides in Ireland&#x27;s religious divide. O&#x27;Connor admits, however, that Carleton could not win either way. In Victorian era Ireland, Protestant readers were demanding stories which unconditionally demonised Catholicism and its adherents, while Catholic readers, &quot;wanted to read nothing about themselves that was not treacle.&quot; As a result, Carleton&#x27;s writings were invariably, &quot;rent asunder by faction-fighters who wished him to write from one distorted standpoint or the other.&quot;

==Influence==
Carleton figures as a precursor of the Celtic revival.

Carleton is featured in the long poem &quot;Station Island&quot; by Séamus Heaney.

The International Astronomical Union named a crater on the planet Mercury &quot;Carleton&quot; in his honour on 19 October 2018.

<doc id="251250" wikidata="Q543956" url="?curid=251250" title="Monodromy">
<text>In mathematics, monodromy is the study of how objects from mathematical analysis, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and differential geometry behave as they &quot;run round&quot; a singularity. As the name implies, the fundamental meaning of &quot;monodromy&quot; comes from &quot;running round singly&quot;. It is closely associated with covering maps and their degeneration into ramification; the aspect giving rise to monodromy phenomena is that certain functions we may wish to define fail to be &quot;single-valued&quot; as we &quot;run round&quot; a path encircling a singularity. The failure of monodromy can be measured by defining a monodromy group: a group of transformations acting on the data that encodes what happens as we &quot;run round&quot; in one dimension. Lack of monodromy is sometimes called &quot;polydromy&quot;.

==Definition==
Let be a connected and locally connected based topological space with base point , and let formula_1 be a covering with fiber formula_2. For a loop based at , denote a lift under the covering map, starting at a point formula_3, by formula_4. Finally, we denote by formula_5 the endpoint formula_6, which is generally different from formula_7. There are theorems which state that this construction gives a well-defined group action of the fundamental group on , and that the stabilizer of formula_7 is exactly formula_9, that is, an element fixes a point in if and only if it is represented by the image of a loop in formula_10 based at formula_7. This action is called the monodromy action and the corresponding homomorphism into the automorphism group on is the algebraic monodromy. The image of this homomorphism is the monodromy group. There is another map whose image is called the topological monodromy group.

==Example==
These ideas were first made explicit in complex analysis. In the process of analytic continuation, a function that is an analytic function in some open subset of the punctured complex plane formula_12 may be continued back into , but with different values. For example, take

: formula_13

Then analytic continuation anti-clockwise round the circle

: formula_14

will result in the return not to but to

: formula_15

In this case the monodromy group is the infinite cyclic group, and the covering space is the universal cover of the punctured complex plane. This cover can be visualized as the helicoid with parametric equations formula_16 restricted to formula_17. The covering map is a vertical projection, in a sense collapsing the spiral in the obvious way to get a punctured plane.

==Differential equations in the complex domain==
One important application is to differential equations, where a single solution may give further linearly independent solutions by analytic continuation. Linear differential equations defined in an open, connected set &quot;S&quot; in the complex plane have a monodromy group, which (more precisely) is a linear representation of the fundamental group of &quot;S&quot;, summarising all the analytic continuations round loops within &quot;S&quot;. The inverse problem, of constructing the equation (with regular singularities), given a representation, is a Riemann–Hilbert problem.

For a regular (and in particular Fuchsian) linear system one usually chooses as generators of the monodromy group the operators &quot;Mj&quot; corresponding to loops each of which circumvents just one of the poles of the system counterclockwise. If the indices &quot;j&quot; are chosen in such a way that they increase from 1 to &quot;p&quot; + 1 when one circumvents the base point clockwise, then the only relation between the generators is the equality formula_18. The Deligne–Simpson problem is the following realisation problem: For which tuples of conjugacy classes in GL(&quot;n&quot;, C) do there exist irreducible tuples of matrices &quot;Mj&quot; from these classes satisfying the above relation? The problem has been formulated by Pierre Deligne and Carlos Simpson was the first to obtain results towards its resolution. An additive version of the problem about residua of Fuchsian systems has been formulated and explored by Vladimir Kostov. The problem has been considered by other authors for matrix groups other than GL(&quot;n&quot;, C) as well.

==Topological and geometric aspects==
In the case of a covering map, we look at it as a special case of a fibration, and use the homotopy lifting property to &quot;follow&quot; paths on the base space &quot;X&quot; (we assume it path-connected for simplicity) as they are lifted up into the cover &quot;C&quot;. If we follow round a loop based at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, which we lift to start at &quot;c&quot; above &quot;x&quot;, we&#x27;ll end at some &quot;c*&quot; again above &quot;x&quot;; it is quite possible that &quot;c&quot; ≠ &quot;c*&quot;, and to code this one considers the action of the fundamental group 1(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) as a permutation group on the set of all &quot;c&quot;, as a monodromy group in this context.

In differential geometry, an analogous role is played by parallel transport. In a principal bundle &quot;B&quot; over a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, a connection allows &quot;horizontal&quot; movement from fibers above &quot;m&quot; in &quot;M&quot; to adjacent ones. The effect when applied to loops based at &quot;m&quot; is to define a holonomy group of translations of the fiber at &quot;m&quot;; if the structure group of &quot;B&quot; is &quot;G&quot;, it is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot; that measures the deviation of &quot;B&quot; from the product bundle &quot;M&quot; × &quot;G&quot;.

===Monodromy groupoid and foliations===

Analogous to the fundamental groupoid it is possible to get rid of the choice of a base point and to define a monodromy groupoid. Here we consider (homotopy classes of) lifts of paths in the base space &quot;X&quot; of a fibration formula_19. The result has the structure of a groupoid over the base space &quot;X&quot;. The advantage is that we can drop the condition of connectedness of &quot;X&quot;.

Moreover the construction can also be generalized to foliations: Consider formula_20 a (possibly singular) foliation of &quot;M&quot;. Then for every path in a leaf of formula_21 we can consider its induced diffeomorphism on local transversal sections through the endpoints. Within a simply connected chart this diffeomorphism becomes unique and especially canonical between different transversal sections if we go over to the germ of the diffeomorphism around the endpoints. In this way it also becomes independent of the path (between fixed endpoints) within a simply connected chart and is therefore invariant under homotopy.

==Definition via Galois theory==
Let F(&quot;x&quot;) denote the field of the rational functions in the variable &quot;x&quot; over the field F, which is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring F[&quot;x&quot;]. An element &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of F(&quot;x&quot;) determines a finite field extension [F(&quot;x&quot;) : F(&quot;y&quot;)].

This extension is generally not Galois but has Galois closure &quot;L&quot;(&quot;f&quot;). The associated Galois group of the extension [&quot;L&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) : F(&quot;y&quot;)] is called the monodromy group of &quot;f&quot;.

In the case of F = C Riemann surface theory enters and allows for the geometric interpretation given above. In the case that the extension [C(&quot;x&quot;) : C(&quot;y&quot;)] is already Galois, the associated monodromy group is sometimes called a group of deck transformations.

This has connections with the Galois theory of covering spaces leading to the Riemann existence theorem.

<doc id="251253" wikidata="Q683505" url="?curid=251253" title="Globus (department store)">
<text>Globus is a Swiss department store company, with nine department stores in Switzerland. It is currently owned by a Thai company, Central Group. The Globus group includes the Herren Globus chain of menswear stores and the Office World chain of office supplies stores, was previously owned by Switzerland&#x27;s largest retailer, Migros.

Its main branches are located in the three principal cities of Switzerland, i.e. Zürich, Geneva and Basel.

It had been a member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1931 to 2020, with various CEOs acting as presidents of the Association over time.

==History==
Globus was founded in 1907 in Zürich, and now has stores in all major Swiss cities. The chain sells mostly upscale goods, including clothing, cosmetics, jewelry and household supplies. The stores are noted for their extensive delicatessen section, called Globus Delicatessa, and their former mascot, Globi, the comic books about whom have been a fixture in the childhood of many Swiss.

In 2020, Migros sold its ownership in Globus to KaDeWe Group, which is co-owned by Austrian conglomerate Signa Holding and Thailand&#x27;s Central Group.

in September 2024, Central Group acquired full ownership of Globus department stores in Switzerland. This acquisition followed financial difficulties and the bankruptcy of Austria&#x27;s real estate tycoon René Benko&#x27;s Signa Group in late 2023, making Central Group the sole owner of all 9 Globus branches in Switzerland.

==Department stores==

There are Globus department stores in:
*Basel, BS
*Bern BE
*Geneva, GE
*Lausanne, VD
*Lucerne, LU
*St. Gallen, SG
*Zürich (2), ZH

<doc id="251257" wikidata="Q1416369" url="?curid=251257" title="Battle of Crysler's Farm">
<text>The Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm, also known as the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Field, was fought on 11 November 1813, during the War of 1812, in the British province of Upper Canada. A British and Upper Canadian force defeated a much larger American invasion force, prompting the US to abandon the Saint Lawrence campaign, its plan to capture Montreal in the autumn of 1813.

The name of the battle comes from a farm owned by Captain John Crysler, an officer in the Dundas County Militia who participated in the battle. The farm served as the headquarters for British forces, although the battle itself occurred on properties towards the east. (The name &quot;Chrysler&#x27;s Farm&quot; is sometimes used for the engagement, but &quot;Crysler&quot; is the proper spelling.)

==Saint Lawrence Campaign==
===American plan===
The battle arose from a United States military campaign that was intended to capture Montreal in the British province of Lower Canada. The resulting military actions, including the Battle of the Chateauguay in Lower Canada, the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm in Upper Canada, and a number of skirmishes, are collectively known as the Saint Lawrence Campaign.
The US plan was devised by United States Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr., who originally intended to take the field himself. Because concentrating the necessary force in one place was difficult due to the initially scattered disposition of the troops and inadequate lines of communication, it involved two forces which were to combine for the final assault. Major General James Wilkinson&#x27;s division of 8,000 was to concentrate at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on Lake Ontario, and proceed down the Saint Lawrence River in gunboats, batteaux and other small craft. At some point, they would rendezvous with a division of 4,000 under Major General Wade Hampton advancing north from Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain, to make the final attack on Montreal.

Even as preparations proceeded, that the plan had several shortcomings was apparent. Until the last minute, the planner were uncertain whether the objective was to be Montreal or Kingston, as Armstrong originally intended to attack and where the British naval squadron on Lake Ontario was based. However, Commodore Isaac Chauncey, commanding the US Navy squadron on the lake, refused to risk his ships in any attack against Kingston. Mistrust followed the US Army officers concerned; Wilkinson had an unsavoury reputation as a scoundrel, and Hampton originally refused to serve in any capacity in the same army as Wilkinson. The troops lacked training and uniforms, sickness was rife and there were too few experienced officers. Chiefly though, neither force could apparently carry sufficient supplies to sustain itself before Montreal, making a siege or any prolonged blockade impossible.

===American preliminary moves===
Hampton began his part of the campaign on 19 September with an advance down the Richelieu River, which flows north from Lake Champlain. He decided that the defences on this obvious route were too strong and instead shifted westward to Four Corners, on the Chateauguay River near the border with Lower Canada. He was forced to wait there for several weeks as Wilkinson&#x27;s force was not ready, which cost him some of his initial advantage in numbers as Canadian troops were moved to the Chateauguay, and reduced his supplies.

Armstrong had intended that Wilkinson&#x27;s force would set out on 15 September. On 2 September, Wilkinson himself had gone to Fort George, which the Americans had captured in May, to arrange the movement of Brigadier General John Parker Boyd&#x27;s division from Fort George to rendezvous with the troops from Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. Possibly because he was ill, he delayed around Fort George for nearly a month. He returned to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, and Boyd&#x27;s division began its movement, only in the first week in October.

The poor prospects for success (and possibly his own illness) led Armstrong to abandon his intention of leading the final assault himself. He handed overall command of the expedition to Wilkinson and departed Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on his way to Washington on 16 October, just before Wilkinson&#x27;s part of the campaign was at last launched. Armstrong&#x27;s letter to Hampton, notifying him of the change in command and also throwing much of the burden of supplying the combined force onto him, arrived the evening before Hampton&#x27;s army fought the Battle of the Chateauguay. Although Hampton nevertheless attacked, as part of his force was already committed to an outflanking move, he immediately sent his resignation, and fell back when his first attack was repulsed.

===Wilkinson&#x27;s moves===
Wilkinson&#x27;s force left Sackett&#x27;s Harbor in 300 batteaux and other small craft on 17 October, bound at first for Grenadier Island at the head of the St. Lawrence. Mid-October was very late in the year for serious campaigning in the Canadas and the American force was hampered by bad weather, losing several boats and suffering from sickness and exposure. It took several days for the last stragglers to reach Grenadier Island.

On 1 November, the first boats set out from the island, and reached French Creek (near present-day Clayton, New York) on 4 November. Here, the first shots of the campaign were fired. British brigs and gunboats under Commander William Mulcaster had left Kingston to rendezvous with and escort batteaux and canoes carrying supplies up the Saint Lawrence. The aggressive Mulcaster bombarded the American anchorages and encampments during the evening. The next morning, American artillerymen under Lieutenant Colonel Moses Porter drove him away, using hastily heated &quot;hot shot&quot;. (The red-hot American cannonballs set fire to the brig &quot;Earl of Moira&quot;, and the crew intentionally scuttled the brig to extinguish the fire. The brig was later salvaged and returned to service.)

From French Creek, Wilkinson proceeded down the river. On 6 November, while at the settlement of Hoags, he received the news that Hampton had been repulsed at the Chateauguay River on 26 October. He sent fresh instructions to Hampton to march westward from his present position at Four Corners, New York and meet him at Cornwall.

Wilkinson&#x27;s force successfully bypassed the British post at Prescott late on 7 November. The troops and ammunition were disembarked and marched around Ogdensburg on the south bank of the river, while the lightened boats ran past the British batteries under cover of darkness and poor visibility. Only one boat was lost, with two killed and three wounded. The next day, while the main body re-embarked, an advance guard battalion commanded by colonels Alexander Macomb and Winfield Scott, followed by a battalion of riflemen under Major Benjamin Forsyth were landed on the Canadian side of the river near Point Iroquois to clear the river bank of harassing Dundas County Militia, who were reported to have turned &quot;every narrow stretch of the waterway&quot; from Leeds to Glengarry into &quot;a shooting gallery&quot;. Here the small Battle of Point Iroquois was fought between 1,200 Americans and 200 men of the Dundas County Militia. This delaying skirmish helped the Canadian forces bolster their defences and gave extra time for preparation in Cornwall.

On the following day (9 November), Wilkinson held a council of war. All his senior officers appeared to be determined to proceed with the expedition, regardless of the difficulties and alarming reports of enemy strength. The advance guard was reinforced with the 2nd Brigade (6th, 15th and 22nd U.S. infantry) under Brigadier General Jacob Brown, who took command of the force which numbered 2.500. Brown&#x27;s force marched eastward along the northern bank of the river, clearing a small British garrison from Fort Matilda, at the river&#x27;s narrowest point. Before the main body could follow by water, Wilkinson learned that a British force was pursuing him. He landed almost all the other troops as a rearguard, under Brigadier General John Parker Boyd. Late on 10 November, after a day spent marching under intermittent fire from British gunboats and field guns, Wilkinson set up his headquarters in Cook&#x27;s Tavern, with Boyd&#x27;s troops bivouacked in the surrounding woods.

===British counter-moves===

The British had been aware of the American concentration at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, but for a long time they had believed, with good reason, that their own main naval base at Kingston was the intended target of Wilkinson&#x27;s force. Major General Francis de Rottenburg, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, had massed his available troops there. When Mulcaster returned from French Creek late on 5 November with news that the Americans were heading down the Saint Lawrence, de Rottenburg dispatched a Corps of Observation after them, in accordance with orders previously issued by Governor General Sir George Prevost.

The corps initially numbered 650 men, and was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison, the commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, the 89th Regiment. They were embarked in the schooners &quot;Beresford&quot; and &quot;Sir Sydney Smith&quot;, accompanied by seven gunboats and several small craft, all commanded by Mulcaster. They departed from Kingston in thick weather late on 7 November and evaded the ships of Commodore Isaac Chauncey, which were blockading the base, among the Thousand Islands at the head of the Saint Lawrence River. On 9 November, they reached Prescott, where the troops disembarked as the schooners could proceed no farther (although Mulcaster continued to accompany them with three gunboats and some batteaux). Morrison was reinforced by a detachment of 240 men from the garrison of Prescott, for a total strength of about 900 men.

Marching rapidly, they caught up with Boyd&#x27;s rearguard on 10 November. That evening they encamped near Crysler&#x27;s Farm, two miles upstream from the American positions. The terrain was mainly open fields, which gave full scope to British tactics and musketry, while the muddy ground (planted with fall wheat) and the marshy nature of the woods surrounding the farm would hamper the American manoeuvres. Morrison was keen to accept battle here if offered.

==Battle==
As dawn broke on 11 November, it was cold and raining, though the rain later eased. Firing broke out in two places. On the river, Mulcaster&#x27;s gunboats began shooting at the American boats clustered around Cook&#x27;s Point, while a Mohawk fired a shot at an American party scouting near their encampment, who replied with a volley. Half a dozen Canadian Militia dragoons bolted back to the main British force, calling that the Americans were attacking. The British force dropped its half-cooked breakfast and formed up, which caused American sentries to report that the British were attacking, and forced the Americans in turn to form up and stand to arms.
At about 10:30 a.m., Wilkinson received a message from Jacob Brown, who reported that the previous evening he had defeated 500 Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders militia at the Battle of Hoople&#x27;s Creek and the way ahead was clear. To proceed, however, the American boats would next have to face the Long Sault rapids and Wilkinson determined to drive Morrison off before attempting them. He himself had been ill for some time, and could not command the attack himself. His second-in-command, Major General Morgan Lewis, was also &quot;indisposed&quot;. This left Brigadier General Boyd in command. He had immediately available the 3rd Brigade under Brigadier General Leonard Covington (9th, 16th and 25th U.S. Infantry) and the 4th Brigade under Brigadier General Robert Swartwout (11th, 14th and 21st U.S. Infantry), with two 6-pounder guns. Some distance down-river were part of Boyd&#x27;s own 1st Brigade under the brigade&#x27;s second-in-command, Colonel Isaac Coles, (12th and 13th U.S. Infantry), four more 6-pounder guns and a squadron of the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. In all, Boyd commanded perhaps 2,500 men (though some sources put the figure at 4,000).

===British dispositions===
The British were disposed in echelon, with their right wing thrown forward:
* Lining a ravine close to the American positions and in the woods on the left was the skirmish line under Major Frederick Heriot of the Canadian Voltigeurs, consisting of three companies of the Voltigeurs and around two dozen Mohawks from Tyendinaga under Interpreter-Lieutenant Charles Anderson. A company of the Dundas Militia fought as skirmishers and stretcher bearers along the skirmish line, commanded by Capt. John Crysler. (A small rifle company of the Leeds Militia may also have been present.)
* The right wing was part of the detachment from Prescott under its commandant, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Pearson. It consisted of the flank (i.e. light and grenadier) companies of the 49th Regiment and a detachment of the Canadian Fencibles (perhaps 150 men in total) with a six-pounder gun of the Canadian Provincial Artillery. They occupied some buildings on the river bank near the Americans, with a small gully protecting their front.
* Behind their left flank were three companies (150 men) of the 2/89th under Captain G. W. Barnes.
* Behind Barnes&#x27;s left flank, in turn, was the British main body; the centre companies of the 49th (160 men) under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Plenderleath on the right and six companies (300 men) of the 2/89th on the left under Morrison himself.
* Morrison stated that he disposed one each of his three 6-pounder guns to support each of his three detachments (Pearson, Barnes and the main body). However, various sources state that while the militia gun was posted with Pearson, the two 6-pounder guns of the Royal Artillery under Captain H. G. Jackson occupied a small hillock behind the 49th, and fired over their heads during the engagement.

===Action===
Boyd did not order an assault until the middle of the afternoon. On the American right, the 21st U.S. Infantry under Colonel Eleazer Wheelock Ripley advanced and drove the British skirmish line back through the woods, for almost a mile. Here they paused, and were joined by the 12th and 13th U.S. Infantry from Coles&#x27; brigade. (Where Swartwout&#x27;s other two regiments were at this point is unclear.) Ripley and Coles resumed their advance along the edge of the woods, but were startled to see a line of redcoats (the 2nd/89th, on Morrison&#x27;s left flank) rise up out of concealment and open fire. The American soldiers dived behind tree stumps and bushes to return fire, and their attack lost all order and momentum. As ammunition ran short, they began to retreat out of line.

Meanwhile, Covington&#x27;s brigade struggled across the ravine and deployed into line, under musket and shrapnel fire. Legend has it that at this point, Covington mistook the battle-hardened 49th Regiment in their grey greatcoats for Canadian Militia and called out to his men, &quot;Come on, my lads! Let us see how you will deal with these militiamen!&quot; A moment later, he was mortally wounded. His second-in-command took over, only to be killed almost immediately. The brigade quickly lost order and began to retreat.

Boyd could not bring all his six guns into action until his infantry were already falling back. When they did open fire from the road along the river bank, they were quite effective. Morrison&#x27;s second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel John Harvey, ordered the 49th to capture them. The 49th made a charge in awkward echelon formation, suffering heavy casualties from the American guns as they struggled across several rail fences. The United States Dragoons (under Wilkinson&#x27;s adjutant general, Colonel John Walbach) now intervened, charging the exposed right flank of the 49th. The 49th halted their own advance, reformed line from echelon formation and wheeled back their right. Under heavy fire from the 49th, Pearson&#x27;s detachment and Jackson&#x27;s two guns, the dragoons renewed their charge twice but eventually fell back, leaving 18 killed and 12 wounded (out of 130). They had bought time for all but one of the American guns to be removed. Barnes&#x27;s companies of the 2/89th overtook the 49th and captured the one gun which had become bogged down and been abandoned.

It was now about half past four. Almost all of the American army was in full retreat. The 25th U.S. Infantry under Colonel Edmund P. Gaines and the collected boat guards under Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Upham held the ravine for a while, but Pearson threatened to get around their left flank, and they, too, fell back. As it was growing dark and the weather was turning stormy, the British halted their advance. The American army meanwhile retreated in great confusion to their boats and crossed to the south (American) bank of the river, although the British did not stand down from battle stations for some time, wary of the Americans renewing the attack. An American witness stated that 1,000 American stragglers had made their way across the river during the battle itself.

===Casualties===
Although the British casualties were reported in Morrison&#x27;s despatches as 22 killed, 148 wounded and 9 missing, it has been demonstrated that a further nine men were killed and an additional four men were missing, giving a revised total of 31 killed, 148 wounded and 13 missing. The American casualties, from the official return, were 102 killed, and 237 wounded including Brigadier General Covington. No figures were given for men missing or captured but the official return notes that three of the sixteen officers listed as wounded were also captured. The number of American prisoners taken was initially reported as &quot;upwards of 100&quot; by Morrison but he wrote that more were still being brought in. The final tally was 120. Most of these were severely wounded men who had been left on the field but fourteen unwounded enlisted men were captured after trying to hide in a swamp. A Canadian who rode across the battlefield on the morning of 12 November remembered it being &quot;covered with Americans killed and wounded&quot;.

==Aftermath==

On 12 November, the sullen American flotilla successfully navigated the Long Sault rapids. That evening, they reached a settlement known as Barnhardt&#x27;s, above Cornwall, where they rendezvoused with Brown&#x27;s detachment. There was no sign of Hampton&#x27;s force, but Colonel Henry Atkinson, one of Hampton&#x27;s staff officers, brought Hampton&#x27;s reply to Wilkinson&#x27;s letter of 6 November. Hampton stated that a shortage of supplies had forced him to retire to Plattsburgh. Wilkinson used this as pretext to call another council of war, which unanimously opted to end the campaign. The defeat of the American forces at the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm and, on 26 October, at the Battle of the Chateauguay, ended the American threat to Montreal in the late fall of 1813, and with it the risk that the Canadas would be cut into two parts.

The army went into winter quarters at French Mills, from the Saint Lawrence, but the roads were almost impassable in this season, and Wilkinson was also forced by a lack of supplies and sickness among his army to retreat to Plattsburg. He was later dismissed from command shortly after a failed attack on a British outpost at Lacolle Mills. He subsequently faced a court martial on various charges of negligence and misconduct during the Saint Lawrence Campaign, but was exonerated when most of the government&#x27;s witnesses refused to testify. Lewis was retired, while Boyd was sidelined into rear-area commands. Brown, Macomb, Ripley and Gaines were subsequently promoted.

On the British side, Mulcaster was promoted to post-captain to take command of a frigate but lost a leg in 1814 during the Raid on Fort Oswego, ending his active career. Morrison also was severely wounded later in 1814 at the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. Morrison, Harvey and Pearson all eventually became generals, as did Major James B. Dennis, who commanded the militia which fought Brown at Hoople&#x27;s Creek.

== Orders of Battle ==
==Legacy==

In 1895, the Canadian Department of Militia and Defence erected a monument on the site. The battle site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1920 and a plaque was placed to mark the site in 1921. The area of Crysler&#x27;s Farm was permanently submerged in 1958 as a result of the construction of the Moses-Saunders Power Dam for the St. Lawrence Seaway. The monument erected in 1895 commemorating the battle was moved from Crysler&#x27;s Farm to Crysler&#x27;s Farm Battlefield Park in Morrisburg.

Ten active regular battalions of the United States Army (1–2 Inf, 2–2 Inf, 1–4 Inf, 2–4 Inf, 3–4 Inf, 1–5 Inf, 2–5 Inf, 1–6 Inf, 2–6 Inf and 4–6 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of a number of American infantry regiments (the old 9th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 25th infantry regiments) that took part in the battle.

The British Army did not award a battle honour for Crysler&#x27;s Farm, however they did issue a General Service Medal for various War of 1812 battles, one of which was Crysler&#x27;s Farm, mis-spelled &quot;Chrystler&#x27;s&quot; on the clasp. Twelve rank and file survived to claim the medal in 1847 for serving at the battle, although others may not have bothered to do so. The 49th Regiment of Foot is perpetuated in the British Army by the Rifles Regiment, while the 89th is perpetuated by the Royal Irish Regiment (1992).

Three regiments of the Canadian Army (the Royal 22e Régiment, the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders and Les Voltigeurs de Québec) do carry the Battle Honour &quot;Crysler&#x27;s Farm&quot;, awarded by the Canadian government in 2012 to Canadian Army regiments that are the successor units of regular and militia units that took part in the battle. The honour commemorates both the significance of the battle for the defence of Canada as well as the sacrifices made by regular and militia units during the engagement.

On the occasion of the bicentennial of the battle (11 November 2013) Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the Crysler&#x27;s Farm Battlefield Park on Remembrance Day and laid a wreath at the cenotaph in the presence of contingents from the Royal 22e Régiment, the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders and Les Voltigeurs de Québec as well as representatives from First Nations who fought there. American and British diplomatic representatives also attended the ceremony and laid wreaths.

<text>Liverpool is a Canadian community and former town located along the Atlantic Ocean of the Province of Nova Scotia&#x27;s South Shore. It is situated within the Region of Queens Municipality, which is the local governmental unit that comprises all of Queens County, Nova Scotia.

==History==

Liverpool&#x27;s harbour was an ancient seasonal camp of Nova Scotia&#x27;s native Mi&#x27;kmaq and was known as Ogomkigeak meaning &quot;dry sandy place&quot; and Ogukegeok, meaning &quot;place of departure&quot;. Samuel de Champlain originally named the harbour Port Rossignol, in honour of Captain Rossignol, an early 17th-century founder of New France in North America who used the harbour for trading. Later Nicolas Denys, a pioneering 17th-century French explorer and trader of Nova Scotia, was granted land here by the leader of Acadia, Isaac de Razilly (c. 1632).

Following the Expulsion of the Acadians (1755) during the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War), Liverpool was founded by New England Planters (commercially organized settlers) as a fishing port in 1759, originally named Lingley after Admiral Charles Lingley, and then renamed after Liverpool in England – which also lies along its own Mersey River. Silvanus Cobb was an original proprietor of the town. In 1759 Capt. Cobb became a proprietor of the new township of Liverpool. Liverpool township was to run from Cape Sable Island to Port Medway and continuing 14 miles inland from the shore. Sylvanus transported many of the other original residents to the new settlement. On July 1, 1760, at the first meeting of the proprietors, Capt. Cobb made a petition to be granted a piece of land to build a house and a wharf. The land was granted and the house was built at the foot of present-day Wolfe Street. There is a park and monument to Cobb at the site of his original home which was built from materials he transported from New England.

=== American Revolution ===

Liverpool&#x27;s struggle for identity during the revolutionary war has been the subject of considerable study by historians. The town was at first sympathetic to the cause of the American Revolution, with outlying outports like Port Medway and Port Mouton almost continuously visited by American privateers, but after repeated attacks by American privateers on local shipping interests and one direct attack on the town itself, Liverpool citizens turned against the rebellion. The defence of the town and the outfitting of privateers was led by Colonel Simeon Perkins.

==== Raid on Liverpool (1778) ====

On April24, 1778, in the Battle off Liverpool, Nova Scotia (1778), the Royal Navy warship HMS &quot;Blonde&quot; under the command of Captain Milligan ran aground the French ship &quot;Duc de Choiseul&quot; under the command of Captain Pattier in Liverpool Harbour. There was an exchange of cannon fire lasting over three hours. A number of the French crew were killed, drowned and wounded. The 100 remaining French crew were taken prisoner. The arms that were on the wrecked ship continued to attract American privateers over the following month. Consequently, on May 1, American privateers raided Liverpool, ravaging and pillaging a number of the houses and stores, including the store of Simeon Perkins, a significant town leader. Three weeks later, on May 21, the same privateers returned and tried to tow the wreck of the &quot;Duc de Choiseul&quot; out to sea. Perkins mustered ten men at the shore. Cannon fire was exchanged by the British militia and the American privateers. The privateers continued to fire at the town for almost an hour. Perkins marched his men along the shore, closer to the privateers. One of the militia was wounded in the ensuing exchanges. The privateers stayed off shore for a number of days. Perkins kept a sergeant and six men on guard duty twenty four hours a day until the privateers left the area.

After suffering three years of similar sporadic raids, the people of Liverpool, on June 2, 1779 built a battery for the artillery, rebuilt Fort Morris (Nova Scotia) and on October 31 launched their own privateer vessel named &quot;Lucy&quot; to bring battle to their adversaries. As well, Perkins wrote a successful appeal to the authorities in Halifax, and on December 13, 1778 Capt. John Howard&#x27;s company of the King&#x27;s Orange Rangers arrived aboard the transport &quot;Hannah&quot;. The company consisted of Howard, 2 lieutenants, 1 ensign, 3 sergeants, 2 or 3 corporals, 48 privates, and several camp followers, both women and children.

In March 1780, Colonel Perkins ordered the seizure of the Dolphin.

==== Raid on Liverpool (1780) ====
The most dramatic privateer raid occurred on September 13, 1780. Two American privateers, the &quot;Surprize&quot; under Cpt. Benjamin Cole, and the &quot;Delight&quot;, under Cpt. Lane, unloaded nearly 70 men at Ballast Cove shortly after midnight. By 4am they had captured the fort and taken Howard, two other officers, and all but six of the KOR garrison as prisoners. Perkins called out the militia, engineered the capture of Cole, and negotiated with Lane for the recovery of the fort and the release of the prisoners. Within a few hours &quot;every thing [was] restored to its former Situation without any Blood Shed.&quot; Liverpool was not bothered by privateers for the remainder of the war.

The town grew following the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) with the arrival of American colonial refugees known as Loyalists.

=== War of 1812 ===
During the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812, Liverpool financed and manned many privateer vessels which primarily targeted French vessels in the West Indies and American shipping off the Nova Scotia and New England coasts. The port was notable for such privateer vessels as the brig &quot;Rover&quot; and the schooner &quot;Liverpool Packet&quot;, mariners such as Joseph Barss, and ships&#x27; chandlers and merchants such as Enos Collins and Simeon Perkins. Significantly, an exciting eye-witness account of this turbulent period can be found in the published diaries of Simeon Perkins (1735–1812), an important businessman and leader in early Liverpool, having arrived from Connecticut in 1762 with the early settlers, and remaining an active member of the town for 50 years until his death in 1812.

=== Nineteenth century ===
During the 19th century, the town became a major seaport as the fishing and ship building industries grew. The town also became a leading exporter of timber which was floated down the Mersey River (or as initially called the &quot;Rivière Rossignol&quot; by the original Acadians) from the inland forests of the Lake Rossignol watershed. For a time after the War of 1812, Liverpool was second only to Halifax as the major port in the province, but was later eclipsed by western ports on the north shore of the province such as Pictou and New Glasgow on the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

The mid-19th century move toward steam-powered vessels which were built with steel, ruined the area&#x27;s vibrant wooden-ship building industry, and the further financial dislocation caused by the collapse of the local Bank of Liverpool in 1871 combined to severely hurt the town&#x27;s economy and it went into a slow decline.

===Twentieth century===
Liverpool&#x27;s fortunes were temporarily revived in the 1920s when it became a centre for rum-runners shipping alcohol to the United States during its period of prohibition. More significant growth took place in 1929 when the Mersey Pulp and Paper Mill was completed in the adjoining village of Brooklyn. The paper company also founded its own shipping line, the Markland Shipping Company based in Liverpool. World War II bolstered the economy further as the town&#x27;s shipyard, Thompson Bros. Machinery Co. Ltd. became a major player in refitting Royal Canadian Navy corvettes and minesweepers.

In 1996, Liverpool disincorporated as a town and merged with the Municipality of the County of Queens to form the Region of Queens Municipality. The Bowater Mersey Pulp and Paper plant closed in 2012.

==Geography==
Liverpool is situated on the Atlantic coast along Nova Scotia&#x27;s South Shore. The community primarily occupies the west bank of the mouth of the Mersey River and along its harbour front faces opposite the smaller community of Brooklyn which is situated on the east bank of the River. Beyond Liverpool, the river widens to become an estuary called Liverpool Bay, which is partially sheltered by Coffin Island, and there melds into the Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream which passes just to the east of Nova Scotia in the Atlantic Ocean provides Liverpool with a year-round temperate northern climate.

Liverpool is located along Trunk Route 3 (&quot;The Lighthouse Route&quot;) and at the junction of major Highway 103 (at Exit 19) and Trunk Route 8 (&quot;The Kejimkujik Scenic Drive&quot;) which leads to the Bay of Fundy.

===Climate===
In spite of its seaside location beside the large Atlantic Ocean; Liverpool has a relatively mild humid continental climate typical of the province. Frequently prevailing inland winds ensure a lack of maritime moderation, resulting in large temperature differences between the warm summers averaging around and the generally cold winter night time temperatures approaching on average. Annual precipitation is quite high with frequent rain and snow storms in the fall, winter and spring. Summers are much drier, pleasant and warm. The highest temperature ever recorded in Liverpool was on 22 August 1976. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 18 February 1922.

==Economy==
As the largest population centre in the fairhaven of Queens County, Liverpool has a diverse business community. Many large business franchises provide modern convenience, while the community&#x27;s quaint small shops still thrive in the original business district on Main Street. Commercial and recreational fishing still play an important role in the local economy. Liverpool&#x27;s largest employer was once the Bowater Mersey Paper Company Limited, which operated a pulp mill and newsprint mill situated in nearby Brooklyn. The mill closed in June 2012.

Queens Place Emera Centre is a major, modern recreation centre that serves the entire Regional Municipality of Queens. The NHL-sized ice surface has double-sided permanent seating for 1000 spectators. The centre was built along with a large Best Western hotel complex to facilitate large tournaments and thus draw visitors to the area. Queens place is home for many hockey teams: local minor hockey team, the Cougars; major hockey team, Western Hurricanes; and a Junior B team, the Liverpool Privateers.

==Tourism==

Tourism has become increasingly important to Liverpool and the South Shore region in recent decades, particularly as tourists travel the &quot;Lighthouse Route&quot; (a scenic drive between Halifax and Yarmouth). Liverpool has a large number of museums for a small community. They include the Queens County Museum and the adjacent Perkins House the 1766 built residence of Simeon Perkins and now part of the Nova Scotia Museum system. Perkins house was closed to the public in 2015 after the province, citing shifting floor beams deemed the building a safety hazard and that the provincial budget cannot afford the cost of repairs. It reopened in 2021 after the repairs were eventually completed.

Other museums include the Museum of Justice located in the former courthouse, the Hank Snow Home Town Museum located in the former Liverpool train station, and two private museums run by Nova Scotian photographer Sherman Hines. Facing Liverpool Harbour is the Fort Point Lighthouse, the third oldest lighthouse in Nova Scotia which contains a lighthouse museum and is surrounded by a public park. In late June of each year, history comes alive in Liverpool during &quot;Privateer Days&quot; when over a long weekend members of the community conduct a parade, provide various entertainment venues, re-enact a Loyalist military and privateer encampment, shoot fireworks, and conduct guided graveyard tours. Liverpool has also become a summer break destination for residents of Halifax due to its warm weather and nearby sandy beaches. Beach Meadows is a 1 km long beach to the east of Liverpool.

<text>Cebes of Thebes (, &quot;gen&quot;.: Κέβητος; &quot;c&quot;. 430 – 350 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher from Thebes remembered as a disciple of Socrates. One work, known as the &quot;Pinax&quot; (Πίναξ) or &quot;Tabula&quot;, attributed to Cebes still survives, but it is believed to be a composition by a pseudonymous author of the 1st or 2nd century AD.

==Life==
Cebes was a disciple of Socrates and Philolaus, and a friend of Simmias of Thebes. He is one of the speakers in the &quot;Phaedo&quot; of Plato, in which he is represented as an earnest seeker after virtue and truth, keen in argument and cautious in decision. Xenophon says he was a member of Socrates&#x27; inner circle, and a frequent visitor to the hetaera, Theodote, in Athens. He is also mentioned by Plato in the &quot;Crito&quot; and &quot;Epistle&quot; &quot;XIII&quot;.

Three dialogues, the &quot;Hebdome&quot;, the &quot;Phrynichus&quot;, and the &quot;Pinax&quot; or &quot;Tabula&quot;, are attributed to him by the &quot;Suda&quot; and Diogenes Laërtius. The two former are lost, and most scholars deny the authenticity of the &quot;Tabula&quot; on the ground of material and verbal anachronisms.

==The &quot;Tablet of Cebes&quot;==
The &quot;Tablet of Cebes&quot; is probably by a pseudonymous author of the 1st or 2nd century. The work professes to be an interpretation of an allegorical picture of a tablet on which the whole of human life with its dangers and temptations was symbolically represented, and which is said to have been dedicated by someone in the temple of Cronus at Athens or Thebes. The author introduces some youths contemplating the tablet, and an old man who steps among them undertakes to explain its meaning. It is intended to show that only the proper development of our mind and the possession of real virtues can make us truly happy. The author develops the Platonic theory of pre-existence, and shows that true education consists not in mere erudition, but rather in the formation of character. Parallels are often drawn between this work and John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

The &quot;Tabula&quot; has been widely translated both into European languages and into Arabic (the latter version published with the Greek text and Latin translation by Claudius Salmasius in 1640). It has often been printed together with the &quot;Enchiridion of Epictetus&quot;. Separate editions have been issued by CS Jerram (with introduction and notes, 1878), Karl Praechter (1893), and many others. An English translation and commentary by John T. Fitzgerald and L. Michael White was published in 1983.

<text>Bolívar () is a department of Colombia. It was named after one of the original nine states of the United States of Colombia. It is located to the north of the country, extending roughly north–south from the Caribbean coast at Cartagena near the mouth of the Magdalena River, then south along the river to a border with Antioquia Department. The departments of Sucre and Córdoba are located to the west, and Atlántico Department to the north and east (most of the border formed by the Canal del Dique). Across the Magdalena River to the east is Magdalena Department. The flag of the department bears a resemblance to the flag of Lithuania.

Its capital is Cartagena de Indias. Other important cities include Magangué, El Carmen de Bolívar and Turbaco.

<text>The Grelling–Nelson paradox arises from the question of whether the term &quot;non-self-descriptive&quot; is self-descriptive. It was formulated in 1908 by Kurt Grelling and Leonard Nelson, and is sometimes mistakenly attributed to the German philosopher and mathematician Hermann Weyl thus occasionally called Weyl&#x27;s paradox or Grelling&#x27;s paradox. It is closely related to several other well-known paradoxes, in particular, the barber paradox and Russell&#x27;s paradox. It is an antinomy, or a semantic self-referential paradox.

==Paradox==
Suppose one interprets the adjectives &quot;autological&quot; and &quot;heterological&quot; as follows:
# An adjective is &quot;autological&quot; (sometimes &quot;homological&quot;) if it describes itself. For example, the English word &quot;English&quot; is autological, as are &quot;unhyphenated&quot; and &quot;pentasyllabic&quot;.
# An adjective is &quot;heterological&quot; if it does not describe itself. Hence &quot;long&quot; is a heterological word (because it is not a long word), as are &quot;hyphenated&quot; (because it has no hyphen) and &quot;monosyllabic&quot; (because it has more than one syllable).

All adjectives, it would seem, must be either autological or heterological, for each adjective either describes itself, or it does not. Problems arise in a number of instances, however.

===Paradoxical cases===

The Grelling–Nelson paradox arises when we consider the adjective &quot;heterological&quot;. One can ask: Is &quot;heterological&quot; a heterological word? If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then &quot;heterological&quot; is autological. This leads to a contradiction, for in this case &quot;heterological&quot; does not describe itself: it must be a heterological word. But if the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then &quot;heterological&quot; is heterological. This again leads to a contradiction, because if the word &quot;heterological&quot; describes itself, it is autological.

* Is &quot;heterological&quot; a heterological word?
** no → &quot;heterological&quot; is autological → &quot;heterological&quot; describes itself → &quot;heterological&quot; is heterological, &quot;contradiction&quot;
** yes → &quot;heterological&quot; is heterological → &quot;heterological&quot; does not describe itself → &quot;heterological&quot; is not heterological, &quot;contradiction&quot;

The paradox can be eliminated, without changing the meaning of &quot;heterological&quot; where it was previously well-defined, by modifying the definition of &quot;heterological&quot; slightly to hold all nonautological words except &quot;heterological&quot;. But &quot;nonautological&quot; is subject to the same paradox, for which this evasion is not applicable because the rules of English uniquely determine its meaning from that of &quot;autological&quot;. A similar slight modification to the definition of &quot;autological&quot; (such as declaring it false of &quot;nonautological&quot; and its synonyms) might seem to correct that, but the paradox still remains for synonyms of &quot;autological&quot; and &quot;heterological&quot; such as &quot;self-descriptive&quot; and &quot;non-self-descriptive&quot;, whose meanings also would need adjusting, and the consequences of those adjustments would then need to be pursued, and so on. Freeing English of the Grelling–Nelson paradox entails considerably more modification to the language than mere refinements of the definitions of &quot;autological&quot; and &quot;heterological&quot;, which need not even be in the language for the paradox to arise. The scope of these obstacles for English is comparable to that of Russell&#x27;s paradox for mathematics founded on sets.

===Arbitrary cases=== 
One may also ask whether &quot;autological&quot; is autological.
It can be chosen consistently to be either:
* if we say that &quot;autological&quot; is autological and then ask whether it applies to itself, then yes, it does, and thus is autological;
* if we say that &quot;autological&quot; is not autological and then ask whether it applies to itself, then no, it does not, and thus is not autological.

This is the opposite of the situation for heterological: while &quot;heterological&quot; logically cannot be autological or heterological, &quot;autological&quot; can be either. (It cannot be both, as the category of autological and heterological cannot overlap.)

In logical terms, the situation for &quot;autological&quot; is:
while the situation for &quot;heterological&quot; is:

===Ambiguous cases===
One may also ask whether &quot;loud&quot; is autological or heterological. If said loudly, &quot;loud&quot; is autological; otherwise, it is heterological. This shows that some adjectives cannot be unambiguously classified as autological or heterological. Newhard sought to eliminate this problem by taking Grelling&#x27;s Paradox to deal specifically with word types as opposed to word tokens.

==Similarities with Russell&#x27;s paradox==
The Grelling–Nelson paradox can be translated into Russell&#x27;s paradox in the following way. First, one must identify each adjective with the set of objects to which that adjective applies. So, for example, the adjective &quot;red&quot; is equated with the set of all red objects. In this way, the adjective &quot;pronounceable&quot; is equated with the set of all pronounceable things, one of which is the word &quot;pronounceable&quot; itself. Thus, an autological word is understood as a set, &quot;one of whose elements is the set itself&quot;. The question of whether the word &quot;heterological&quot; is heterological becomes the question of whether the set of all sets which do not contain themselves contains itself.

<doc id="251281" wikidata="Q901048" url="?curid=251281" title="Pathological jealousy">
<text>Pathological jealousy, also known as morbid jealousy, Othello syndrome, or delusional jealousy, is a psychological disorder in which a person is preoccupied with the thought that their spouse or romantic partner is being unfaithful without having any real or legitimate proof, along with socially unacceptable or abnormal behaviour related to these thoughts. The most common cited forms of psychopathology in morbid jealousy are delusions and obsessions. It is considered a subtype of delusional disorder.

==Definition==
This disorder occurs when a person typically makes repeated accusations that their spouse or sexual partner is being unfaithful, based on insignificant, minimal, or no evidence, often citing seemingly normal or everyday events or material to back up their claims.

Unlike many other delusional disorders, people who suffer from this disorder have a strong association with stalking, cyberstalking, sabotage, or even violence. It can be found in the context of schizophrenia and delusional disorder, such as bipolar disorder, but is also associated with alcoholism and sexual dysfunction, and has been reported after neurological illness (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Parkinson&#x27;s).

The name &quot;Othello Syndrome&quot; comes from the character in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Othello&quot;, who murders his wife as a result of a false belief that she has been unfaithful. Some psychologists and psychiatrists have asserted that Othello was deceived rather than deluded about Desdemona&#x27;s alleged infidelity, and thus did not have ‘the Othello Syndrome’.

==Psychiatric history==
:* Presenting difficulties: neurotic or psychotic jealousy
:* Past psychiatric history: neurotic or psychotic disorders, deliberate self-harm, and attempted suicide
:* Family history: mental illness, including pathological jealousy
:* Relationship history: incorporating both the current and previous relationships, and taking account of the quality of the relationships and the difficulties experienced
:* Forensic history: previous and pending charges and convictions, as well as deviant behavior which was not reported or did not result in a charge or conviction (including aggressive behavior and stalking)
:* Medical history: organic causes which may be responsible for the morbid jealousy (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Parkinson&#x27;s)

==Forms==
*Obsessions: the individual&#x27;s own thoughts are egodystonic; they are acknowledged to be senseless, and usually resisted. Jealous thoughts are experienced as intrusive and excessive, and compulsive behavior such as checking up on their partner may follow. Egodystonicity (the distress caused by thoughts that are unwanted and viewed as contrary to conscious wishes) generally varies a large amount between patients and “a continuum from obsessional to delusional, which morbid jealousy has been suggested” (Insel &amp; Akiskal 1986).
*Extreme obsessions: much time is taken up by jealous concerns, and there is a great difficulty in putting the concerns out of the mind. Impairment of the relationship, limitation of the partner&#x27;s freedom, and checking on the partner&#x27;s behavior may occur. Although a distinction was occasionally difficult to make, the categories of ‘psychotic’ (delusional) and ‘neurotic’ jealousy contained similar proportions (each between one-third and one-half).
*Delusions: the individual&#x27;s own thoughts are egosyntonic; they are regarded as true, and not resisted. Some authors compare morbid jealousy to a delusional state (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Enoch &amp; Trethowan, 1979). Beliefs may include the morbidly jealous subjects&#x27; suspicion that: 1. he or she is being poisoned or given some substance(s) to decrease sexual potency by the partner, 2. that the partner has contracted a sexually transmitted disease from a third party 3. that the partner is engaging in sexual intercourse with a third party while the subject sleeps.
*Overvalued ideas: One symptom may on some instances be viewed as overvaluing an idea, which is defined as “an acceptable, comprehensible idea pursued by the patient beyond the bounds of reason. The idea is not resisted and, although it is not a delusion, the patient characteristically attaches utmost importance to investigating and maintaining the partner’s fidelity at great personal disadvantage and to the distress of the partner”. Overvalued ideas are characterized by being existent in the individual&#x27;s own thoughts, being egosyntonic; meaning that the ideas project the behaviors, values, and feelings that are aligned with the desires and aims of the individual&#x27;s ego, or consistent with the individual&#x27;s ideal self-image, the ideas are also amenable to reason but are not resisted.

==Causes==

===Psychological===
There are many psychological causes that go along with morbid jealousy. Some people equate morbid jealousy with a delusional state. “Delusions of infidelity exist without any other psychopathology and may be considered to be morbid jealousy in its ‘purest’ form” (Kingham and Gordon). For morbid jealousy to occur one&#x27;s memories are subconsciously changed, and their partner&#x27;s actions are misinterpreted as well to the extent that the person is absolutely convinced of betrayal from the partner. It is thought that even some brain disorders might eventually lead to delusions of betrayal. It has also been recorded by Cobb (1979) “that morbid jealousy may be present with all types of cerebral insult or injury.” &quot;It has been suggested that morbid jealousy may potentially arise in response to reduced sexual function”. Cobb (1979) drew attention to the elderly man whose waning sexual powers were insufficient to satisfy a younger wife.

Mullen (1990) considered morbid jealousy to be associated with four features:
* An underlying mental disorder emerges before or with the jealousy
* The features of the underlying disorder coexist with the jealousy
* The course of morbid jealousy closely relates to that of the underlying disorder
* The jealousy has no basis in reality

===Personality===
People who are very insecure, or even fearful, are more likely to become anxious, or question their partner&#x27;s commitment to them. “Insecure attachment style correlates strongly with borderline personality disorder” (Kingham and Gordon).

===Environmental===
Some people even believe that someone who is morbidly jealous might suspect that he or she is being drugged or given some kind of substance that might decrease their sexual potency, or they might even be under the impression that their significant other has somehow received a sexually transmitted disease from another person while the subject is unaware.

==Epidemiology==

There is no known prevalence of morbid jealousy; currently, there is no community survey tracking its existence in individuals. As of 1979, it was considered to be a rare occurrence. Still, many counselors encounter cases of morbid jealousy. Some clinicians may not at first be able to treat this condition due to other dominating psychopathologies present within the jealous person that call for priority attention.

Men and women differ dramatically when it comes to morbid jealousy. Men who suffer from morbid jealousy are more likely than women to use violence and also are more likely to harm or kill with their hands rather than a blunt object. Women on the other hand, when using violence, tend to use a blunt object or knife. Men focus on the rival&#x27;s status and resources when it comes to the threat of jealousy they fear. Women tend to become more jealous of a potential threat based on their rival&#x27;s youth and physical attractiveness.

==Triggers==
For men the strongest trigger is sexual infidelity, and with women the strongest trigger is emotional infidelity. If partner-related violence does not stop infidelity from happening, the male mate will sometimes resort to suicide instead. The final resort to stopping infidelity inside of morbid jealousy is to commit partner murder. Women are much less likely to kill their partner, unless it is in self-defense. Morbid jealousy can occur in a number of conditions such as chronic alcoholism, addiction to substances other than alcohol (&quot;i.e.&quot;, cocaine, amphetamines), organic brain disorders (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Parkinson&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s), schizophrenia, neurosis, affective disturbances, or personality disorders.

==Associated drug and alcohol use==
Alcohol and drug misuse has a well-recognized association with morbid jealousy. “In two studies, morbid jealousy was present in 27% and 34% respectively of men recruited from alcohol treatment services” (Shrestha &quot;et al.&quot;, 1985; Michael &quot;et al.&quot;, 1995). Amphetamine and cocaine increase the possibility of a delusion of infidelity that can continue after intoxication stops. (Shepherd, 1961).

==Assessment==

In an attempt to counsel or treat the morbid jealousy of an individual, proper and thorough assessment must be employed. This approach is broad in nature, but necessary so as to provide adequate information that will aid in the possible reparation of a dynamic containing a morbidly jealous person. To begin, a careful history should be taken of both partners if possible; separate and together. It is imperative that a full and detailed psychiatric history and mental state examination be recorded for the jealous partner; doing so may enable one to distinguish whether the jealousy is obsessional or delusional in nature. It is also possible that the jealousy may be the result of a thought that has been given too much importance. Considering that jealousy is a very delicate issue, any reference made to it should be approached carefully and with tact. It must be kept in mind that the jealous individual may be displacing blame for their issues onto their partner and their alleged infidelity as opposed to their own behavior. If there is any history of relevant or related mental illness and substance misuse it should be noted as it may possibly be a contributing or aiding factor. In order to get the best grasp on the issues and begin positive progression, multiple interviews should be held to assess the marital relationship.

After completing the assessment, it is best to deliver information about risk with both individuals in the relationship. Due to confidentiality, the patient should give consent for this information to be shared unless there is a risk to another individual and it is serious and immediate. This is the only case in which confidentiality is invalid. The professional should ensure that all necessary steps are taken to guarantee the safety of a potential victim, keeping in mind that it is possible that authorities may have to be alerted regarding the matter. If the professional has reason to believe that there is a high risk of harm to themselves or another person, the individual who is morbidly jealous should be admitted to a hospital as soon as possible to prevent any negative outcomes for any parties involved.

==Management==
Morbid jealousy encompasses various psychiatric states and the best way to approach treatment depends on the symptoms that are observed in the individual. Therefore, prognosis and outcomes vary from person to person and depends on the situation and the complexities of the interpersonal relationships being observed. Also, other issues that may exacerbate the negative aspects of the environment created by jealous behavior need to be addressed in order to begin reparations. For example, if alcoholism plays a role in the behavior of the morbidly jealous individual, treatment of their addiction can positively affect their progress in trying to change their jealous nature. While psychotherapy can be an effective method of treating morbidly jealous persons, it is not sufficient when the nature of their illness is more serious. It is not possible to say that there is one form of treatment that is superior over all those that are currently available. Even though this may be true, cognitive behavioral therapy is the treatment that has proven to be most effective.

==Risks associated==

===Confirmatory behaviors===
When suspicions of the partner&#x27;s fidelity arise, they quickly become all that is thought about. Certain behaviors, such as interrogation of the partner, repeated telephone calls to work and surprise visits, stalking behavior, setting up recording devices in the home or work, or hiring a private detective to follow the partner, are all common in trying to determine if there is truly infidelity or if it is just perceived. Individuals who are jealous may take drastic measures, such as searching the partner&#x27;s clothing and belongings, looking through diaries and other communication methods (email, text messaging), or examining bed sheets, undergarments, and even genitalia for evidence of sexual activity.

===Harm to self===
Suicidal thoughts are common in morbid jealousy, especially because of its association with depression and substance abuse.

===Risk to others===
Violence can occur in any relationship tainted with jealousy, either normal or morbid jealousy. In a study of jealousy by Mullen &amp; Martin in 1994, 15% of both men and women reported that at some time they had been “subjected to physical violence at the hands of a jealous partner.” Culturally, jealousy may be even used to “justify violence towards partners.” Victims in a homicide case are most likely to be current or ex-partners in both female and male perpetrators. When a partner repeatedly denies infidelity, this may provoke anger and extreme violence. On the other hand, the partner that is suffering may give up and give a false confession, which in turn most likely will provoke rage in the jealous individual. In the U.S. a sample was taken of 20 participants with delusional jealousy. 19 were male and the researchers found that 12 had threatened to kill their spouse because of their perceived infidelity. Of the 12 males, all actually attacked their spouse. Out of the 20, a weapon was used by three of them, and 12 had harmed their spouse. The one female participant also attacked her spouse. A presence of paranoid delusions and hallucinations of injury to the spouse were most often associated with violence. This suggests that individuals who suffer from delusional jealousy who partake in violence may be solely driven by psychotic phenomena. A higher risk of assault was associated with alcohol consumption.

===Risk to children===
Children who live in a household with a parent who suffers from morbid jealousy may suffer emotional and/or physical abuse as a direct result of the actions made by the parent. Children may also accidentally overhear arguments or witness physical violence between their parents. They could even be potentially accidentally injured during assaults. The morbidly jealous parent may employ a child or more than one to spy on the other parent. It is not out of the question for a child to witness a homicide or suicide where their parent is the victim.

<text>The Qixi Festival (), also known as the Qiqiao Festival (), is a Chinese festival celebrating the annual meeting of Zhinü and Niulang in Chinese mythology. The festival is celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh lunisolar month on the Chinese lunisolar calendar.

A celebration of romantic love, the festival is often described as the traditional Chinese equivalent of Valentine&#x27;s Day. The festival is derived from Chinese mythology: people celebrate the romantic legend of two lovers, Zhinü and Niulang, who were the weaver girl and the cowherd, respectively. The tale of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl has been celebrated in the Qixi Festival since the Han dynasty. The earliest-known reference to this famous myth dates back to more than 2,600 years ago, which was told in a poem from the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;.

The festival has variously been called the Double Seventh Festival, the Chinese Valentine&#x27;s Day, the Night of Sevens, or the Magpie Festival.

== Origin ==
The popular tale is a love story between Zhinü (, the weaver girl, symbolizing Vega) and Niulang (, the cowherd, symbolizing Altair). Niulang was often abused by his sister-in-law. They eventually kicked him out of the house, and gave him nothing but an old cow. One day, the old cow suddenly spoke out, telling Niulang that there would be fairies bathing in the spring nearby that night. The fairy would stay there if she failed to go back to heaven before morning. In accordance with what the old cow said, Niulang saw those beautiful fairies in the spring, and fell in love with one of the beautiful fairies who was the heavenly weaver. In order to make her stay, he took her clothes that helped her to go back to heaven; this made her an ordinary earth woman without any power. They then got married and had two children. The Emperor of Heaven (, ) found out about this and was furious, so he sent minions to escort the heavenly weaver back to heaven. Niulang was heartbroken. The old cow suddenly spoke out again, telling Niulang he could take his skin to make it into a flying coat to chase after them; and Niulang did. However, the Queen Mother of the West drew a Silver River (The Milky Way) in the sky and blocked his way. Meanwhile, the love between Niulang and the weaver moved the magpie, and so they built a bridge of magpies over the Silver River for them to meet. The Emperor of Heaven was also moved by the sight, and allowed this couple to meet on the Magpie Bridge once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. That was the origin of the Qixi Festival.

== Traditions ==
During the Han dynasty, the practices were conducted in accordance with formal ceremonial state rituals. Over time, the festival activities also included customs that the common people partook in.

Girls take part in worshipping the celestials () during rituals. They go to the local temple to pray to Zhinü for wisdom. Paper items are usually burned as offerings. Girls may recite traditional prayers for dexterity in needlework, which symbolizes the traditional talents of a good spouse. Divination could take place to determine the possible dexterity in needlework. They make wishes for marrying someone who would be a good and loving husband. During the festival, girls make a display of their domestic skills. Traditionally, there would be contests amongst those who attempted to be the best in threading needles under low-light conditions, like the glow of an ember or of a half moon. Today, girls sometimes gather toiletries in honour of the seven maidens.

The festival also held an importance for newlywed couples. Traditionally, they would worship the celestial couple for the last time and bid farewell to them (). The celebration stood as a symbol for a happy marriage and showed that the married woman was treasured by her new family.

On this day, the Chinese gaze up at the sky to look for Vega and Altair shining in the Milky Way, while Deneb, a third star, forms a symbolic bridge between the two stars. It was said that if it rains on this day, it was caused by a river sweeping away the magpie bridge or that the rain is the tears of the separated couple. Based on the legend of a flock of magpies forming a bridge to reunite the couple, a pair of magpies came to symbolize conjugal happiness and faithfulness.

The eating customs of Qixi Festival vary from place to place, and are called eating Qiao food. The most famous traditional food people eat on Qixi Festival is Qiao Guo, which has a history of more than one thousand years since it became popular during the Song dynasty. The main ingredients are flour, oil. and honey, sometimes adding sesame, peanuts, kernels, roses, and other different ingredients. After mixing those ingredients, the people then deep-fry them. Beyond that, people would eat crunchy candy, refreshments, and fruits together, expressing the people&#x27;s pursuit of ingenuity, family health, and happy life wishes.

== Literature ==
Many pieces of literature, such as poems, songs, and operas, have been written for this festival and about the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, dating back to the Zhou dynasty &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;. Many describe the atmosphere of the festival or narrate related stories. This has left a valuable literary legacy which helps modern scholars better understand ancient Chinese customs, feelings, and opinions relating to the festival.

; Far, Far Away, the Cowherd – Anonymous (a Han dynasty &quot;yuefu&quot;)
&lt;poem lang=zh-hant&gt;
迢迢牽牛星， Far, far away, the Cowherd,
皎皎河漢女。 Fair, fair, the Weaving Maid;
纖纖擢素手， Nimbly move her slender white fingers,
札札弄機杼。 Click-clack goes her spinning-loom.
終日不成章， All day she weaves, yet her web is still not done
泣涕零如雨。 And her tears fall like rain.
河漢清且淺， Clear and shallow the Milky Way,
相去復幾許？ They are not far apart!
盈盈一水間， But the stream brims always between
脈脈不得語。 And, gazing at each other, they cannot speak.

(Translated by Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang)
&lt;/poem&gt;

; An Autumn Night – Du Mu (Tang dynasty)
&lt;poem lang=zh-hant&gt;
銀燭秋光冷畫屏， A candle flame flickers against a dull painted screen on a cool autumn night,
輕羅小扇撲流螢。 She holds a small silk fan to flap away dashing fireflies.
天階夜色涼如水， Above her hang celestial bodies as frigid as deep water,
坐看牽牛織女星。 She sat there watching Altair of Aquila and Vega of Lyra pining for each other in the sky.

(Translated by Betty Tseng)
&lt;/poem&gt;

; Immortals at the Magpie Bridge – Qin Guan (Song dynasty)
&lt;poem lang=zh-hant&gt;
纖雲弄巧， Clouds float like works of art,
飛星傳恨， Stars shoot with grief at heart.
銀漢迢迢暗渡。 Across the Milky Way the Cowherd meets the Maid.
金風玉露一相逢， When Autumn’s Golden Wind embraces Dew of Jade,
便勝却人間無數。 All the love scenes on earth, however many, fade.
柔情似水， Their tender love flows like a stream;
佳期如夢， Their happy date seems but a dream.
忍顧鶴橋歸路。 How can they bear a separate homeward way?
兩情若是久長時， If love between both sides can last for aye,
又豈在朝朝暮暮。 Why need they stay together night and day?

(Translated by Xu Yuanchong)
&lt;/poem&gt;

She is the executive founder of Wellville, a nonprofit project focused on improving equitable wellbeing. Dyson is also an angel investor focused on health care, open government, digital technology, biotechnology, and outer space. Dyson&#x27;s career now focuses on health and she continues to invest in health and technology startups.

==Education and early life==
Esther Dyson&#x27;s father was English-born, American-naturalized physicist Freeman Dyson, and her mother was mathematician Verena Huber-Dyson, of Swiss parentage; her brother is science historian George Dyson. Her paternal grandfather was the composer Sir George Dyson. She was educated at Harvard University, where she studied economics and wrote for &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;.

==Career==
After graduating she joined Forbes as a fact-checker and quickly rose to reporter. In 1977, she joined New Court Securities following Federal Express and other start-ups. After a stint at Oppenheimer Holdings covering software companies, she moved to Rosen Research in 1982. In 1983, when she bought the company from her employer Ben Rosen, Dyson renamed the company EDventure Holdings and his &quot;Rosen Electronic Letter&quot; newsletter &quot;Release 1.0&quot;. She and business partner Daphne Kis sold EDventure Holdings to CNET Networks in 2004 and left CNET in January 2007.

On 7 October 2008, Space Adventures announced that Dyson had paid to train as a back-up spaceflight participant for Charles Simonyi&#x27;s trip to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz TMA-14 mission which took place in 2009.

<text>The [[Tony Award]] for Best Revival was given to the best play, musical or non-musical, which had already appeared on Broadway in a previous production. It was presented from 1977, where it was called &quot;Most Innovative Production of a Revival&quot; and later &quot;Reproduction (Play or Musical)&quot; in 1980, until 1994, when it was split into the Best Revival of a Musical and the Best Revival of a Play.

If there are not enough revivals, it is possible under the current Tony rules for this category to return. Any time there are three play revivals and three musical revivals, the categories are automatically separated; if there are fewer, the Tony Awards Administration Committee may still choose to split up the categories.

<text>Germania ( ; ), also more specifically called Magna Germania (English: &quot;Great Germania&quot;), Germania Libera (English: &quot;Free Germania&quot;), or Germanic [[Barbaricum]] to distinguish it from the Roman provinces of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior, was a historical region in north-central Europe during the Roman era, which was associated by Roman authors with the Germanic peoples. According to Roman geographers, this region stretched roughly from the Rhine in the west to the Vistula in the east, and to the Upper Danube in the south, and the known parts of southern Scandinavia in the north. Archaeologically, these people correspond roughly to the Roman Iron Age of those regions. 

The Latin name &quot;Germania&quot; means &quot;land of the Germani&quot;, but the etymology of the name &quot;Germani&quot; itself is uncertain. During the Gallic Wars of the 1st century BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar encountered &quot;Germani&quot; originating from beyond the Rhine. He referred to their lands beyond the Rhine as &quot;Germania&quot;. West of the Rhine, the prosperous Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior, sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;Roman Germania&quot;, were established in northeast Roman Gaul, while territories east of the Rhine remained independent of Roman control. The Roman emperors also sought to expand east of the Rhine to the Elbe, but these efforts were hampered by the victory of Arminius at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. 

From the 3rd century AD, Germanic peoples moving out of Magna Germania began encroaching upon and occupying parts of Roman Germania. This contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, after which territories of Roman Germania were captured and settled by migrating Germanic people. Large parts of Germania subsequently became part of the Frankish Empire and later East Francia. The name of Germany in English and many other languages is derived from the name &quot;Germania&quot;.
==Etymology==
In Latin, the name &quot;Germania&quot; means &quot;lands where people called Germani live&quot;. Modern scholars do not agree on the etymology of the name &quot;Germani&quot;. Celtic, Germanic, Illyrian and Latin etymologies have been suggested.

The main source on the origin of the names &quot;Germania&quot; and &quot;Germani&quot; is the book &quot;Germania&quot; (98 AD) by Tacitus. Tacitus writes that the name &quot;Germania&quot; was &quot;modern and newly introduced&quot;. According to Tacitus, the name &quot;Germani&quot; had once been applied only to the Tungri, west of the Rhine, but it became an &quot;artificial name&quot; (&quot;invento nomine&quot;) for supposedly-related peoples east of the Rhine. Many modern scholars consider Tacitus&#x27;s story to be plausible, but they are unsure whether the name was commonly used by &quot;Germani&quot; to refer to themselves.

==Geography==

The boundaries of Germania are not clearly defined, particularly at its northern and eastern fringes. Magna Germania stretched approximately from the Rhine in the west to beyond the Vistula river in the east, and from the Danube in the south and northwards along the North and Baltic seas, including Scandinavia. Germania Superior encompassed parts of modern-day Switzerland, southwest Germany and eastern France, while Germania Inferior encompassed much of modern-day Belgium and Netherlands.

In his &quot;Geography&quot; (AD 150), the Roman geographer Ptolemy provides descriptions of the geography of Germania. Modern scholars have been able to localize many of the place names mentioned by Ptolemy, and associated them with place names of the present day.

Germania was inhabited by a large number of peoples, and there was not much unity among them. It appears that Germania was not entirely inhabited by Germanic peoples. Hydronymy provides evidence for the presence of another Indo-European group, which probably lived under Germanic domination.

== History ==

During the Gallic Wars of the 1st century BC, the Roman general Julius Caesar came into contact with peoples originating east of the Rhine. In his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, Caesar refers to these peoples as the Germani, and the lands from where they originated as Germania. The Romans appear to have borrowed the name from the Gauls. Having defeated the Germanic chieftain Ariovistus in Gaul, Caesar built bridges across the Rhine and conducted punitive expeditions in Germania. He writes the area was composed of numerous Germanic states, which were not entirely united. According to Caesar, the Gallic Volcae Tectosages had once crossed the Rhine and colonized parts of Germania, but had since become militarily inferior to the Germani. He also writes that Germani had once crossed the Rhine into northeast Gaul and driven away its Gallic inhabitants, and that the Belgae claimed to be largely descended from these Germanic invaders.

In the late 1st century BC, the Roman emperor Augustus launched campaigns across the Rhine, and incorporated areas of Germania as far east as the Elbe into the Roman Empire, creating the short-lived Roman province of Germania Antiqua in 7 BC, with further aims of establishing a greater province of Magna Germania, with headquarters at Colonia (modern-day Cologne). The Roman campaign was severely hampered by the victory of Arminius at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9. The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania, and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history. The Rhine eventually became the border between the Roman Empire and Magna Germania. Areas of northeast Gaul bordering the Rhine remained under Roman control, and are often referred to as &quot;Roman Germania&quot;. Four Roman legions were stationed there, and a Roman fleet, the &quot;Classis Germanica&quot;, was also established. The area was effectively governed as Roman provinces.

Areas of Germania independent of Roman control were referred to as &quot;Magna Germania&quot;. Modern scholars sometimes refer to the Magna Germania as &quot;Free Germania&quot; (Latin: &quot;Germania Libera&quot;) or Germanic Barbaricum. As parts of Roman social engineering efforts, large numbers of Germani, including Ubii and Sicambri, were settled within Roman Germania in order to prevent revolts by resident Gauls. Roman Germania became characterized by a mixed Celtic, Germanic and Roman population, which became progressively Romanized.

By the mid 1st century AD, between eight and ten Roman legions were stationed in Roman Germania to protect the frontiers. From AD 69 to AD 70, Roman Germania was heavily affected by the Revolt of the Batavi. Tacitus writes that the leader of the revolt, Gaius Julius Civilis, recruited a vast amount of warriors from his self-described &quot;kinsmen&quot; all over Germania, and hailed Arminius for having liberated Germania from slavery. Civilis&#x27; rebels seized Colonia (modern-day Cologne), capital of Roman Germania and home of the Germanic Ubii, who according to Tacitus were considered traitors by other Germani for having &quot;forsworn its native country&quot;. After initially seeking to raze all of Colonia to the ground, the forces of Civilis declared the city returned &quot;into the unity of the German nation and name&quot; and &quot;an open city for all Germans&quot;. Although initially declaring the rebels and &quot;other Germans&quot; their &quot;kinsmen by blood&quot;, the Ubii, a Germanic Tribe eventually assisted the Romans in recapturing the Colonia.

In the late 1st century AD, under the leadership of the Flavian dynasty, the provinces of Germania Inferior (headquartered at Colonia) and Germania Superior (headquartered at Mogontiacum) were created out of Roman Germania and other eastern parts of Roman Gaul. They hosted a large military force and carried out lucrative trade with Magna Germania, which greatly contributed to the wealth of Roman Gaul. &quot;Germania&quot; (98 AD) by Tacitus provided vivid descriptions of the peoples of Magna Germania.

In the late 1st and early 2nd century AD, the Romans reoccupied areas lying between the Rhine, Main, and Danube rivers. This area became known as the Agri Decumates. Additional numbers of Germani were settled by the Romans within this area. The Roman fortifications on the border with Magna Germania were known as the &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot;. The 3rd century AD saw the emergence of several powerful Germanic confederations in Magna Germania, such as the Alemanni and Franks. The Crisis of the Third Century included raids on Roman Germania by Alemanni and Franks, and the area briefly became part of the Gallic Empire established by the usurper Postumus. Around 280 AD, the Agri Decumates were evacuated by the Romans and occupied by Alemanni.

Under Diocletian (3rd century AD), Germania Superior was renamed &quot;Germania Secunda&quot;, while Germania Inferior was renamed &quot;Maxima Sequanorum&quot;. Both provinces were under the Diocese of Gaul. The provinces of Roman Germania continued to be subjected to repeated Alemannic and Frankish attacks. In the late 4th century AD and early 5th century AD, Gothic Wars in the Balkans forced the Romans to withdraw troops from Roman Germania. In 406, a large number of people fleeing the Huns crossed the Rhine from Magna Germania into Roman Germania and Gaul, leading to the eventual collapse of Roman rule there, and the emigration of large numbers of Romans, particularly Roman elites. Roman Germania was subsequently occupied by Alemanni and Franks. During subsequent centuries, peoples of Germania played a major role in dismembering what was left of the Western Roman Empire. Large parts of Germania, including all of Roman Germania, were eventually incorporated into the Frankish Empire.
==Archaeology==

From the 1st to the 4th century AD, Magna Germania corresponds archaeologically to the Roman Iron Age. In recent years, progress in archaeology has contributed greatly to the understanding of Germania. Areas of Magna Germania were largely agrarian, and display archaeological commonalities with each other, while being strongly differentiated from that of Roman Germania, largely due to the absence of cities and independent coinage. Archaeological discoveries testify to flourishing trade between Magna Germania and the Roman Empire. Amber was a primary export out of Magna Germania, while Roman luxury goods were imported on a large scale. Such goods have been found as far as Scandinavia and Western Russia.

==Legacy==

The name Germania is attested in Old English translations of Bede and Orosius. Since the 17th century, the most common name of Germany in English has been derived from the name &quot;Germania&quot;.

<doc id="251302" wikidata="Q853475" url="?curid=251302" title="President of Colombia">
<text>The president of Colombia (President of the Republic) is the head of state and head of government of Colombia. The president heads the executive branch of the national government and is the commander-in-chief of the Military Forces of Colombia.

The power of the presidency has grown substantially since the first president, Simón Bolívar, took office in 1819. While presidential power has waxed and waned over time, the presidency has played an increasingly important role in Colombian political life since the early 20th century, with a notable expansion during the presidency of Álvaro Uribe.

The office of president was established upon the ratification of the Constitution of 1819, by the Congress of Angostura, convened in December 1819, when Colombia was the &quot;Gran Colombia&quot;. The first president, General Simón Bolívar, took office in 1819. His position, initially self-proclaimed, was subsequently ratified by Congress.

The president is directly elected through Universal Suffrage for a period of four years, along with the vice president. According to article 125 of the constitution, ratified in 2018, no person who has been elected for a presidential term can be elected for a second. In addition, three vice presidents have become president by virtue of the death or resignation of a president during the term. In total, 34 people have served in 36 presidencies that span 48 four-year terms, with Alfonso López Pumarejo, Álvaro Uribe and Juan Manuel Santos being the only ones with double terms, in the case of López Pumarejo non-consecutive. Gustavo Petro is the 34th and current president, having assumed office on 7 August 2022.

== Executive powers ==
===Commander-in-chief===
One of the most important executive powers is the role of the president as Commander-in-Chief of the Colombian Military Forces. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the armed forces. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander in chief has been ratified in article 189 of the Constitution, where it is described that the president has the function of directing the public force and disposing of it as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. of the Republic.

===Administrative powers===
The Executive Branch is responsible for executing, in a coordinated manner, all the administrative activities that are at the service of the general interests of the community for the fulfillment of the essential purposes of the State. It is represented by the President of the Republic, who symbolizes national unity, is the head of state, head of government and supreme administrative authority.

The National Government is formed by the President of the Republic, the ministers of the office and the directors of administrative departments. The President and the corresponding Minister or Director of the Department, in each particular business, constitute the Government.

===Judicial powers===
The responsibility of judging the president of the republic is found in the Supreme Court of Justice, the main body in the event that the president is taken to Political Trial, within the actions of the Supreme Court there will be 7 of which are, Judge the President of the Republic or whoever acts in his place and the senior officials referred to in article 174, for any punishable act imputed to them, in accordance with article 175 numerals 2 and 3.

===Foreign affairs===
it requires the president to &quot;receive the ambassadors.&quot; This clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy, and endorses the exclusive authority of the president to grant recognition to a foreign government. The Constitution also empowers the president to appoint Colombian ambassadors and to propose and mainly negotiate agreements between Colombia and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice of the minister of foreign affairs, become binding with the force of national law.

While foreign affairs have always been an important element of presidential responsibilities, technological advances since the adoption of the Constitution have increased presidential power. Where previously ambassadors were vested with significant power by the president to negotiate independently on Colombia&#x27;s behalf, presidents now routinely meet directly with leaders of foreign countries.

== Leadership roles ==
As head of state, the president is the visible face of Colombia&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy. In his role as leader, one of his aspects is to represent and safeguard the international image of the country, since 1934, the year in which it was officially created, it is the protocol office of the First Lady, she is the one who is in charge of accompanying the president at his receptions. and state visits abroad, gaining more importance over time.

The president of Colombia symbolizes the National Unity, and after taking an oath to the Constitution of Colombia and swearing to defend and protect the nation&#x27;s laws, he is charged to guarantee and protect the rights and liberties of all Colombian nationals.

The Administrative Department of the Presidency of Colombia has the commission to assist or support the president of Colombia on its constitutional mandated functions and legal issues.

Article 115 states that the National Government is formed by the president of Colombia, the vice president of Colombia, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Colombia and the Directors of the Administrative Departments of Colombia. Any official from these entities constitute the Government of Colombia in any particular business.

Any act by the president of Colombia, in order to be legal and enforceable, must be sanctioned by any of the ministries or department directors, who will also be held responsible for the act. The only exception is if the president appoints or removes ministers, administrative departments&#x27; directors and any other officials appointed by him under his administrative authority. Governors of the Departments of Colombia, mayors of Municipalities of Colombia, as well as regional superintendents of Colombia, public establishments and industrial and commercial state owned enterprises, are all part of the executive branch of Colombia.

== Selection process ==
===Eligibility===
The president must be a natural-born citizen of Colombia, at least 30 years of age. The Constitution of Colombia requires the president to meet the same eligibility requirements as the president that can be re-elected. Individuals are eligible to serve an unlimited number of terms as president.

* be a natural-born citizen
* be a at least 30 years old

===Campaigns and nomination===
The modern presidential campaign begins before primary elections, which political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is the party&#x27;s or coalition&#x27;s presidential candidate. In general, the presidential candidate of the party or, failing that, the coalition of parties chooses a candidate for the vice-presidency, generally being the second with the highest number of votes in the convention. The most common previous profession of presidents is that of a lawyer.

===Election===
The president and vice president serve a term of office of four years after being elected by popular vote. Since 2015, the president is barred from running for reelection, even for a nonconsecutive term.

From 1910 to 2005, the president was limited to a single term. However, on 24 November 2005, the Colombian Congress introduced the Electoral Guarantees Law (Ley de Garantias Electorales), which modified Article 152, of the Colombian Constitution of 1991 and allowed a president to run for a second term. The President or Vice President running for re-election was required to formally notify the National Electoral Council and guarantee a fair competition for the other contenders. Participation of acting officials in political proselytism was standardized. Presidents or vice presidents not running for office were barred from participating on political proselytism. If one or both were running, they could only engage in political activity four months before the primary elections. Also, if the president and/or vice president were running for office, they could participate in their political party&#x27;s selection mechanism to postulate candidates. In 2010, the Constitutional Court of Colombia threw out a planned referendum to allow presidents to run for three consecutive terms. It ruled that Colombian presidents could only serve two terms, even if they are nonconsecutive. In 2015, a constitutional amendment repealed the 2004 changes and reverted to the original one-term limit.

===Inauguration===

The inauguration of the President is made up of various ceremonies and traditions carried out on August 7 every four years. Through democratic elections or coups, resignations and deaths, presidential inaugurations have been important events in the history of Colombia, which at the same time mark the beginning of new eras.

===Presidential sash===

The presidential sash is considered symbolic, which determines the figure of the president, there are no official records, but the first presidential sash was introduced by Antonio Nariño, who simulated the decoration sash of order, over the years it has had different designs being one of the most characteristic, its first design that only consisted of the 3 colors of the national flag, currently the presidential sash consists of the colors of the flag in the same order with the only difference that it consists of the coat of arms in the central part, emulating the presidential flag

==Incumbency==
===Residence===

Currently the official residence of the Colombian president is the Casa de Nariño. While in office, the president has the right to use its facilities and personnel, including medical care, recreation, domestic services, and security services. The first presidential palace where Simón Bolívar dispatched after Independence of Colombia was the former Palace of the Viceroys, which was located on the western side of the Plaza Mayor of Bogotá (where the Palacio Liévano is currently located). The 1827 earthquake left the property partially destroyed, for which reason the presidential office and the official residence were moved to the Palacio de San Carlos. In 1885, the president Rafael Núñez ordered the purchase of the house where Antonio Nariño was born to use it as an official residence. In 1906, the architect Gastón Lelarge transformed the property into the Palacio de la Carrera and in 1979 the architect Fernando Alsina remodeled the building to the current Casa de Nariño and designed the Plaza de Armas that left it directly connected to the National Capitol.

The House of Illustrious Guests in the city of Cartagena de Indias is the house where the Colombian president receives international guests. Likewise, the President has the Hato Grande country estate, located in Sopó, Cundinamarca as a resting place, which belonged to General Francisco de Paula Santander and was later acquired by the businessman from Antioquia Pepe Sierra, whose family donated it to the national government.

===Travel ===

When traveling within Colombia or abroad, the President of the Republic uses the presidential plane identified with the registration FAC 0001, (a Boeing 737 Business Jet BBJ class). The president also uses two helicopters in VIP configuration, a Bell 412 with the registration FAC 0004 and a UH-60 Black Hawk with the registration FAC 0007.

=== Protection ===

On December 7, 1927, President Miguel Abadía Méndez signed a decree officially founding the Presidential Guard. On August 16, 1928, the battalion was given its current name, with its first commander being Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Perea Sanclemente. Memorable actions of this battalion are remembered such as the protection given to the president during the violent acts of the Bogotazo (April 9, 1948) and during the Palace of Justice Siege on November 6, 1985. Resolution 3446 of August 17, 1955, created the medallion “Guardia Presidencial” and Decree 1880 of 1988 ruled the award merits for this prize given to the distinguished members of the battalion for their loyalty, service and good behavior.

Since August 16, 1928, the security of the president has been in the hands of the Presidential Guard, who also has the mission of maintaining the security of the president, his family and his official residence, the Casa de Nariño. Since 1958 it was given to the Presidential Guard Battalion, a sui generis organization in the National Army, with a representation of the four arms and its units were called Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery and Engineers.

<text>De origine actibusque Getarum (&quot;The Origin and Deeds of the Getae&quot;), commonly abbreviated Getica (), written in Late Latin by Jordanes in or shortly after 551 AD, claims to be a summary of a voluminous account by Cassiodorus of the origin and history of the Gothic people, which is now lost. However, the extent to which Jordanes actually used the work of Cassiodorus is unknown. It is significant as the only remaining contemporaneous resource that gives an extended account of the origin and history of the Goths, although to what extent it should be considered history or origin mythology is a matter of dispute.

==Synopsis of the work==
The &quot;Getica&quot; begins with a discussion of a large island named Scandza, which faces the mouth of the Vistula river and had been described by the writers Claudius Ptolemy and Pomponius Mela. Jordanes reports this island to be the original home of many different peoples including the Goths, who have swarmed like bees from there (16-25). Jordanes commences the history of the Goths with the emigration of a Gothic king named Berig with three ships from Scandza to Gothiscandza (25, 94), in the distant past. In the account of Jordanes (or Cassiodorus), Herodotus&#x27; Getian demi-god Zalmoxis becomes a king of the Goths (39). Jordanes tells how the Goths sacked &quot;Troy and Ilium&quot; just after they had recovered somewhat from the war with Agamemnon (108). They are also said to have encountered the Egyptian pharaoh Vesosis (47). The less-fictional part of Jordanes&#x27; work begins when the Goths encounter Roman military forces in the 3rd century AD. The work concludes with the defeat of the Goths by the Byzantine general Belisarius, which was recent in the time of Jordanes. Jordanes states that he writes to honour those who were victorious over the Goths after a history of 2030 years.

==Importance and credibility==
Because the original work of Cassiodorus has not survived, the work of Jordanes is one of the most important sources for the period of the migration of the European tribes, and the Ostrogoths and Visigoths in particular, from the 3rd century AD. Jordanes mentioned that his work, perhaps via Cassiodorus, also drew upon Gothic &quot;folk songs&quot; (&quot;carmina prisca&quot;) as an important source, and a Gothic chronicler . Modern scholars have struggled to find any confirming evidence that his claims about such sources can give credibility to the more doubtful parts of the work.

Like many other classical writers, Jordanes equated the earlier Getae to the later Goths. He specified that he did this on the testimony of Orosius Paulus. In a passage that has become controversial, he identifies the Venedi, a people mentioned by Tacitus, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, with the Slavs of the 6th century. Since as early as 1844, this passage has been used by some scholars in eastern Europe to support the idea that there was a distinct Slavic ethnicity long before the last phase of the Late Roman period. Others have rejected this view because of the absence of concrete archaeological and historiographical data.

The book is important to some medieval historians because it mentions the campaign in Gaul of one Riothamus, &quot;King of the Brettones,&quot; a possible source of inspiration for the early stories of King Arthur.

One of the major questions concerning the historicity of the work is concerning the periods before the Goths enter the written record in the third century. Although there is a range of views, the earliest parts of the narratives are considered mainly mythological, and the account becomes more reliable as it approaches the 6th century. Whether or not Cassiodorus was the main collator of the information about the earliest Goths, not only contains chronologically untenable parts, but also shows evidence of being to at least partly derived by culling ancient Greek and Latin authors for descriptions of peoples who &quot;might&quot; have been Goths. Furthermore, it seems that Jordanes distorted Cassiodorus&#x27;s narrative by presenting a cursory abridgement of it mixed with 6th-century ethnic names.

Some scholars claim that, while acceptance of Jordanes&#x27; text at face value may be too naïve, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes writes that the Goths originated in Scandinavia in 1490 BC. Although the chronology is untenable, one Austrian historian, Herwig Wolfram, believes that there might be a kernel of truth in the claim, proposing that a clan of the Gutae may have left Scandinavia and contributed to the ethnogenesis of the Gutones in eastern Pomerania (see Wielbark culture). An example of more believable material concerning the more recent centuries is the name of King Cniva, which David S. Potter thinks is genuine because, since it doesn&#x27;t appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.

On the other hand, a Danish scholar, Arne Søby Christensen, claims that the &quot;Getica&quot; is an entirely fabricated account, and that the origin of the Goths that Jordanes outlines is a construction based on popular Greek and Roman myths, as well as misinterpretation of recorded names from Northern Europe. The purpose of this fabrication, according to Christensen, may have simply been to preserve a memory of a people who, at the time, looked liked they were about to cease to exist. Canadian scholar Walter Goffart suggests another incentive, arguing that the &quot;Getica&quot; was part of a conscious plan by Justinian I and the propaganda machine at his court to affirm that the Goths and their barbarian cousins did not belong to the Roman world, thus justifying the claims of the Eastern Roman Empire to hegemony over the western part.

==Editions==

A manuscript of the text was rediscovered in Vienna in 1442 by the Italian humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini. Its &quot;editio princeps&quot; was issued in 1515 by Konrad Peutinger, followed by many other editions.

The classic edition is that of 19th-century German classical scholar Theodor Mommsen (in &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;, &quot;auctores antiqui&quot;, v. i.). The best surviving manuscript was the &quot;Heidelberg manuscript&quot;, written in Heidelberg, Germany, probably in the 8th century, but this was destroyed in a fire at Mommsen&#x27;s house on July 7, 1880. Subsequently, another 8th-century manuscript was discovered, containing chapters I to XLV, and is now the &#x27;Codice Basile&#x27; at the Archivio di Stato in Palermo. The next of the manuscripts in historical value are the &quot;Vaticanus Palatinus&quot; of the 10th century, and the &quot;Valenciennes manuscript&quot; of the 9th century.

Jordanes&#x27; work had been well known prior to Mommsen&#x27;s 1882 edition. It was cited in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s classic 6 volumes of &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1776), and had been earlier mentioned by Degoreus Whear (1623) who refers to both Jordanes&#x27; &quot;De regnorum ac temporum successione&quot; and to &quot;De rebus Geticis&quot;.

==Sources==

In his Preface, Jordanes presents his plan
:&quot;...to condense in my own style in this small book the twelve volumes of [Cassiodorus] Senator on the origin and deeds of the Getae [i.e. Goths] from olden times to the present day.&quot;
Jordanes admits that he did not then have direct access to Cassiodorus&#x27;s book, and could not remember the exact words, but that he felt confident that he had retained the substance in its entirety. He goes on to say that he added relevant passages from Latin and Greek sources, composed the Introduction and Conclusion, and inserted various things of his own authorship. Due to this mixed origin, the text has been examined in an attempt to sort out the sources for the information it presents.

===Jordanes himself===

Former notarius to a Gothic magister militum Gunthigis, Jordanes would have been in a position to know traditions concerning the Gothic peoples without necessarily relying on anyone else. However, there is no evidence for this in the text, and some of the instances where the work refers to &quot;carmina prisca&quot; can be shown to depend on classical authors.

===Cassiodorus===

Cassiodorus was a native Italian (Squillace, Bruttium), who rose to become advisor and secretary to the Gothic kings in various high offices. His and the Goths&#x27; most successful years were perhaps the reign of Theodoric. The policy of Theodoric&#x27;s government at that time was reconciliation and in that spirit he incorporated Italians into the government whenever he could. He asked Cassiodorus to write a work on the Goths that would, in essence, demonstrate their antiquity, nobility, experience and fitness to rule.

Theodoric died in 526 and Cassiodorus went on to serve his successors in the same capacity. He had not by any means forgotten the task assigned to him by his former king. In 533 a letter ostensibly written by King Athalaric to the senate in Rome, but ignored by Cassiodorus, mentions the great work on the Goths, now complete, in which Cassiodorus &quot;&quot;restored the Amali with the illustriousness of their race&quot;.&quot;
The work must have been written at Ravenna, seat of the Gothic kings, between 526 at latest and 533.

What Cassiodorus did with the manuscripts after that remains unknown. The fact that Jordanes once obtained them from a steward indicates that the wealthy Cassiodorus was able to hire at least one full-time custodian of them and other manuscripts of his; i.e., a private librarian (a custom not unknown even today).

Jordanes says in the preface to &quot;Getica&quot; that he obtained them from the librarian for three days in order to read them again (relegi). The times and places of these readings have been the concern of many scholars, as this information possibly bears on how much of &quot;Getica&quot; is based on Cassiodorus.

There are two main theories, one expressed by the Mierow source below, and one by the O&#x27;Donnell source below. Mierow&#x27;s is earlier and does not include a letter cited by O&#x27;Donnell.

Gothic sovereignty came to an end with the reconquest of Italy by Belisarius, military chief of staff for Justinian, ending in 539. Cassiodorus&#x27; last ghost writing for the Gothic kings was done for Witiges, who was removed to Constantinople in 540. A number of token kings ruled from there while Belisarius established that the Goths were not going to reinvade and retake Italy (which was however taken again by the Lombards after Justinian&#x27;s death).

Cassiodorus retired in 540 to his home town of Squillace, where he used his wealth to build a monastery with school and library, &quot;Vivarium&quot;.

===Authors cited by &quot;Getica&quot;===
The events, persons and peoples of &quot;Getica&quot; are put forward as being up to many centuries prior to the time of Jordanes. Taken at face value, they precede any other history of Scandinavia.

Jordanes does cite some writers well before his time, to whose works he had access but we do not, and other writers whose works are still extant. Mierow gives a summary of these, which is reviewed below, and also states other authors he believed were used by Jordanes but were not cited in &quot;Getica&quot; (refer to the Mierow source cited below). Mierow&#x27;s list of cited authors is summarized as follows:

*Ablabius. Otherwise unknown historian, author of the work &quot;Gothorum gentis&quot; (&quot;of the Gothic people&quot;), now lost.
*Dexippus on the Vandals and the Heruli.
*Dio, either Dio Cassius or Dio Chrysostom, author of another &quot;Getica&quot;. Description of Britain in Jordanes.
*Fabius. Otherwise unknown, author of a work including the siege of Ravenna, now missing.
*Josephus in IV.29, brief mention of the Goths as Scyths.
*Livy, brief mention in II.10.
*Lucan on the Amali, V.43.
*Pompeius Trogus, now known only in Justinus&#x27; epitome of &quot;Historiae Philippicae&quot;.
*Pomponius Mela.
*Priscus. Events concerning Attila.
*Ptolemy on Scandinavia in &quot;Getica&quot; Part III.
*Strabo. Authority on Britain.
*Symmachus. Copies of his copies from Julius Capitolinus on Maximinus.
*Tacitus. Authority on Britain.
*Virgil.

==The Late Latin of Jordanes==
The early Late Latin of Jordanes evidences a certain variability in the structure of the language which has been taken as an indication that the author no longer had a clear standard of correctness. Jordanes tells us in &quot;Getica&quot; that he interrupted work on the &quot;Romana&quot; to write &quot;Getica&quot;, and then finished &quot;Romana&quot;. Jordanes states in &quot;Romana&quot; that he wrote it in the 24th year of the emperor Justinian, which began April 1, 551. In &quot;Getica&quot; he mentions a plague of nine years previous. This is probably the Plague of Justinian, which began in Egypt in 541, reached Constantinople in 542 and Italy in 543. The time is too early to identify a direction of change toward any specific Romance language, as none had appeared yet. This variability, however, preceded the appearance of the first French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, etc. After those languages developed, the scholastics gradually restored classical Latin as a means of scholarly communication.

Jordanes refers to himself as &quot;agrammaticus&quot; before his conversion. This obscure statement is sometimes taken to refer to his Latin. Variability, however, characterizes all Late Latin, and besides, the author was not writing just after his conversion (for the meaning of the latter, see under Jordanes), but a whole career later, after associating with many Latin speakers and having read many Latin books. According to him, he should have been grammaticus by that time. More likely, his style reflects the way Latin was under the Goths.

Some of the variabilities are as follows (Mierow):

Orthography. The spelling of many words differs from the classical standard, which Jordanes would certainly have known. For example, &quot;Grecia&quot; replaces &quot;Graecia&quot;; &quot;Eoropam&quot; replaces &quot;Europam&quot;; &quot;Atriatici&quot; replaces &quot;Adriatici&quot;.

Inflection. Substantives migrate between declensions, verbs between conjugations. Some common changes are fourth to second (&quot;lacu&quot; to &quot;laco&quot;), second declension adjective to third (&quot;magnanimus&quot; to &quot;magnanimis&quot;), &quot;i&quot;-stems to non-&quot;i&quot;-stems (&quot;mari&quot; to &quot;mare&quot; in the ablative). Gender may change. Verbs may change voice.

One obvious change in a modern direction is the indeclinability of many formerly declined nouns, such as &quot;corpus&quot;. Also, the &quot;-m&quot; accusative ending disappears, leaving the preceding vowel or replacing it with &quot;-o&quot; (Italian, Romanian), as in &quot;Danubio&quot; for &quot;Danubium&quot;.

Syntax. Case variability and loss of agreement in prepositional phrases (&quot;inter Danubium Margumque fluminibus&quot;), change of participial tense (&quot;egressi [...] et transeuntes&quot;), loss of subjunctive in favor of indicative, loss of distinction between principal and subordinate clauses, confusion of subordinating conjunctions.

Semantics. Different vocabulary appears: &quot;germanus&quot; for &quot;frater&quot;, &quot;proprius&quot; for &quot;suus&quot;, &quot;civitas&quot; for &quot;urbs&quot;, &quot;pelagus&quot; for &quot;mare&quot;, etc.

<doc id="251307" wikidata="Q211775" url="?curid=251307" title="Pulpit">
<text>A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church. The origin of the word is the Latin &quot;pulpitum&quot; (platform or staging). The traditional pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility, accessed by steps, with sides coming to about waist height. From the late medieval period onwards, pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board, &quot;tester&quot; or &quot;abat-voix&quot; above and sometimes also behind the speaker, normally in wood. Though sometimes highly decorated, this is not purely decorative, but can have a useful acoustic effect in projecting the preacher&#x27;s voice to the congregation below, especially prior to the invention of modern audio equipment. Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his bible, notes or texts upon.

The pulpit is generally reserved for clergy. This is mandated in the regulations of the Catholic Church, and several others (though not always strictly observed). Even in Welsh Nonconformism, this was felt appropriate, and in some chapels a second pulpit was built opposite the main one for lay exhortations, testimonies and other speeches. Many churches have a second, smaller stand called the lectern located in the Epistle side, which can be used by lay persons, and is often used for other Scripture lessons and ordinary announcements. The traditional Catholic location of the pulpit to the left side of the chancel or nave has been generally retained by Lutherans and many Anglicans, while in Presbyterian and Baptist churches the pulpit is located in the centre behind the communion table. Many modern Roman Catholic churches have an ambo that functions as both a pulpit and lectern.

Equivalent platforms for speakers are the bema (bima, bimah) of ancient Greece and Jewish synagogues, and the minbar of Islamic mosques. &quot;From the pulpit&quot; is often used synecdochically for something which is said with official church authority.

==Location==
In many Reformed and Evangelical Protestant denominations, the pulpit is at the centre of the front of the church, while in the Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican traditions the pulpit is placed to one side and the altar or communion table is in the centre. In many Christian churches, there are two speakers&#x27; stands at the front of the church. Often, the one on the left (as viewed by the congregation) is called the pulpit. Since the Gospel lesson is often read from the pulpit, the pulpit side of the church is sometimes called the &quot;gospel side&quot;.

In both Catholic and Protestant churches the pulpit may be located closer to the main congregation in the nave, either on the nave side of the crossing, or at the side of the nave some way down. This is especially the case in large churches, to ensure the preacher can be heard by all the congregation. Fixed seating for the congregation came relatively late in the history of church architecture, so the preacher being behind some of the congregation was less of an issue than later. Fixed seating facing forward in the nave and modern electric amplification has tended to reduce the use of pulpits in the middle of the nave. Outdoor pulpits, usually attached to the exterior of the church, or at a preaching cross, are also found in several denominations. If attached to the outside wall of a church, these may be entered from a doorway in the wall, or by steps outside.

The other speaker&#x27;s stand, usually on the right (as viewed by the congregation), is known as the lectern. The word &quot;lectern&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;lectus&quot; past participle of legere, meaning &quot;to read&quot;, because the lectern primarily functions as a reading stand. It is typically used by lay people to read the scripture lessons (except for the Gospel lesson), to lead the congregation in prayer, and to make announcements. Because the epistle lesson is usually read from the lectern, the lectern side of the church is sometimes called the &quot;epistle side&quot;. In other churches, the lectern, from which the Epistle is read, is located to the congregation&#x27;s left and the pulpit, from which the sermon is delivered, is located on the right (the Gospel being read from either the centre of the chancel or in front of the altar).

Though unusual, movable pulpits with wheels were also found in English churches. They were either wheeled into place for each service where they would be used or, as at the hospital church in Shrewsbury, rotated to different positions in the church quarterly in the year, to allow all parts of the congregation a chance to have the best sound. A portable outside pulpit of wood and canvas was used by John Wesley, and a 19th-century Anglican vicar devised a folding iron pulpit for using outdoors.

==Origins==
The Ancient Greek &quot;bema&quot; () means both &#x27;platform&#x27; and &#x27;step&#x27;, and was used for a variety of secular raised speaking platforms in ancient Greece and Rome, and from those times to today for the central raised platform in Jewish synagogues. Modern synagogue bimahs are often similar in form to centrally placed pulpits in Evangelical churches.

The use of a bema carried over from Judaism into early Christian church architecture. It was originally a raised platform, often large, with a lectern and seats for the clergy, from which lessons from the Scriptures were read and the sermon was delivered. In Western Christianity the bema developed over time into the sanctuary and chancel (or presbytery).

The next development was the &quot;ambo&quot;, from a Greek word meaning an elevation. This was originally a raised platform from which the Epistle and Gospel would be read, and was an option to be used as a preacher&#x27;s platform for homilies, though there were others. Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) is recorded as preaching from the ambo, but this was probably uncommon at this date. In cathedrals early bishops seem often to have preached from their chair in the apse, echoing the position of magistrates in the secular basilicas whose general form most large early churches adopted. Often there were two ambos, one to each side, one used more as a platform on which the choir sang; sometimes the gospel was read, chanted or sung from one side and the epistle from the other. The location of the ambo within the church varied, with about the same range of places as modern pulpits. In ancient Syrian churches it was often placed in the centre of the nave (on both axes). Gradually the ambo came to resemble the modern pulpit in both form and function, though early examples in large churches are often large enough to accommodate several people. The steps up to the pulpit almost invariably approach it from the side or behind, and are often curved. The typical design of the Islamic minbar, where a straight flight of steps leads to the front of the pulpit, is very different.

The Ambon of Henry II, an Imperial gift of 1014 to Aachen Cathedral, was originally installed centrally, but later moved to the side. It is richly decorated with sheets of gold, ivory, and gems, probably emulating Justinian&#x27;s lost pulpit of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, of which a description by Paul the Silentiary survives. In churches where there is only one speaker&#x27;s stand at the front of the church, it serves the functions of both lectern and pulpit and may be called the ambo, which is still the official Catholic term for the place the gospel is read from.

Large raised pulpits, elaborately carved with relief panels, were important monuments in the Italian Duecento, with the best known including those of the Pisa Baptistery (dated 1260) and Siena Cathedral Pulpit by Nicola Pisano and the Pulpit of Sant&#x27; Andrea, Pistoia, by his son Giovanni Pisano, 1297-1301.

==Catholicism==

Preaching had always been important in Catholicism, but received a particular revival in the late Middle Ages with the two preaching orders of friars, the Franciscans and Dominicans, the former tending to an emotional and populist style and the latter more intellectual. Some preaching was done outdoors by touring preachers, but the orders, especially in Italy, soon began constructing large churches designed to hold congregations who came to hear star preachers. These featured large raised pulpits, typically some way down the nave, and sometimes in pairs on either side of the nave. These were both used for various purposes, whether different readings in services, accommodating singers or musicians at times, or for disputations between two speakers across the nave. Accordingly, they often have a larger platform area than later pulpits. For example, the St. Antony&#x27;s Church, Ollur, pulpit is one of the tallest and largest relief sculptured wooden pulpit in India. 
In Western Catholic Churches, the stand used for readings and homilies is formally called the ambo. Despite its name, this structure usually more closely resembles a lectern than the ambon of the Eastern Catholic Churches. The readings are typically read from an ambo in the sanctuary, and depending on the arrangement of the church, the homily may be delivered from a raised pulpit where there is one. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM) specifies:

==Protestantism==
It is central to Protestant belief that the clergy should preach sermons on Biblical passages to the congregation. To achieve this, some existing churches were adapted to place the clergyman in a position audible to all, which in larger churches usually places this in a visible location, and raised up. This had long been the practice in larger Catholic churches and many smaller ones, but was now made universal. In smaller churches the pulpit remained in the traditional east end of the church, where altars were usually located, but was often raised higher than before.

In Protestant churches, the pulpit is considered one of the most important pieces of furniture in the church. In certain Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches designed with a pulpit-centered chancel, the pulpit is located centrally in relation to the congregation and raised, with the communion table being in front of it. In such churches it may be where the minister stands for most of the service. In the eighteenth century, double-decker and triple-decker pulpits were often introduced in English-speaking countries. The three levels of lecterns were intended to show the relative importance of the readings delivered there. The bottom tier was for the parish clerk, the middle was the reading desk for the minister, and the top tier was reserved for the delivery of the sermon. A good example of a three-decker pulpit is found in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Slaidburn, Lancashire. America&#x27;s only surviving three-decker pulpit on the centerline of the church is at Trinity Church, Newport, Rhode Island. In Lutheran churches, as well as many Anglican and Methodist churches designed with a divided chancel, the pulpit is located on the Gospel side of the chancel (from which the Gospel is read and the sermon is delivered) while a lectern is located on the Epistle side of the sanctuary, with the latter being used by readers to vocalize the other Scripture lessons.

In many Evangelical Christian churches, the pulpit stands squarely in the centre of the platform, and is generally the largest piece of church furniture. This is to symbolise the proclamation of the Word of God as the central focus of the weekly service of worship. In more contemporary evangelical churches, the pulpit may be much smaller, if used at all, and may be carried out after the end of the song service. Often placed in the centre of the platform as well, the item of furniture may be used by both lay and ordained members, in effect doubling as a lectern.

In the 1600s and 1700s, particularly in Lutheran churches in Germany and Scandinavia, the pulpit altar became a popular design in churches, combining the pulpit and the altar.

===Presbyterian Protestant churches===
Traditional Presbyterian Churches in Scotland and elsewhere often had a central pulpit, that is, the pulpit was located in the centre of the chancel in the position where most churches have the communion table or altar. The table could be situated in front of the pulpit or to the side, and sometimes was not in the chancel area at all.

This declares the Bible to be the foundation of the faith. Furthermore, the &quot;Centrality of the Word&quot; implies that the reading and preaching of the Bible is the centrepiece of a service of worship, and thus takes priority over the sacraments. The central pulpit is intended to give visual representation of this idea.

Since the late 19th century, the fashion in the Church of Scotland and most other Presbyterian denominations has been for a return to the pre-Reformation layout. Thus many buildings which once had a central pulpit now have a pulpit to the side. See for example Skene Parish Church or Old West Church, Boston, Massachusetts.

This Presbyterian tradition is historically distinct from the tradition of the ambon in Eastern Christianity.

==Eastern Christianity==
In modern Eastern Christianity the area directly in front of the Beautiful Gates of the iconostasis from which the Gospel is typically read is called the ambon, and the entire low elevation above the level of the nave in front of the iconostasis is called the soleas. In larger churches, the ambo might be distinguished by three curved steps by which one may reach it from the nave. In addition many Orthodox churches, especially Greek-speaking churches, have pulpits for preaching from, which are similar to those in Western Christianity.

In Eastern Orthodox Church cathedrals there is usually a low platform in the center of the nave called the &quot;episcopal ambo&quot; where the bishop is vested prior to the Divine Liturgy and where he is enthroned until the Little Entrance. If the bishop is serving in a simple parish church, an episcopal ambo is set temporarily in place. There are huge intricately carved wooden pulpits, some of the biggest in India and the world, in the Syrian churches of Kerala, India

In addition to the ambo, many major churches in Greece and Cyprus also have a raised pulpit on the left side of the nave, usually attached to a column and raised several feet high. This is reached by a narrow flight of stairs. It is considered an architectural element that is symmetrical to the bishop&#x27;s throne, which is located in an equivalent position on the right. Pulpit and throne are usually similar in construction, usually made of either sculpted stone or sculpted wood. This pulpit was used mostly for sermons and in order to improve audibility, before the advent of modern public address systems in churches. Nowadays it is used rarely. Tradition dictates that it be used for the reading of the &quot;12 Passion Gospels&quot; during the Matins of Holy Friday, served late in the evening of Maundy Thursday. This is done to signify that the Passion of Christ is being &quot;broadcast&quot; for all to know. In the same spirit, a phonetic transcription of the relevant Gospel passages is provided in several common languages (e.g. English, French, Russian, Arabic etc.), so that they may be read from this pulpit at the same time.

==Decorations==
The exterior of a wood or stone pulpit may be decorated, especially with carved reliefs, and in the centuries after the Protestant Reformation these were sometimes, especially in Lutheran churches, one of the few areas of the church left with figurative decoration such as scenes from the Life of Christ. Pulpit reliefs were especially important at the start of the Italian Renaissance, including those from the Pisa Baptistry (1260) and Siena Cathedral Pulpit (1265–68) by Nicola Pisano, the Pulpit of Sant&#x27; Andrea, Pistoia by Giovanni Pisano (1301), and those by Donatello

Elements of decoration shared between Catholic and Protestant denominations are the flowers that may be placed in front of the pulpit, and the antependium or &quot;pulpit fall&quot;, a piece of cloth that covers the top of the book-stand in the pulpit and hangs down a short way at the front. It is often of a rich material and decorated with Christian symbols. Flags and banners used by church-related organizations may also stand on the floor around the pulpit.

In the Reformed tradition, though avoiding figurative art, pulpits were increasingly important as a focus for the church, with the sanctuary now comparatively bare and de-emphasized, and were often larger and more elaborately decorated than in medieval churches.

The bookstand of the pulpit (usually in medieval churches) or lectern (common in Anglican churches) may be formed in the shape of an eagle. The eagle symbolizes the gospels, and shows where these were read from at the time the eagle was placed there. When pulpits like those by the Pisani with eagles in stone on them were built the gospel reading was done from the pulpit.

The spread of the sounding board offered artists decorating Catholic Baroque churches a space for spectacular features of various types on top of it. An artistic conceit largely confined to the 18th-century Rococo churches of South Germany was to shape the body of the pulpit as a ship, to utilize the old metaphor of the church as a ship. This allowed for fantastical plaster or wood decoration of sails and rigging manned by angels above, and apostles hauling in nets below.

<text>The Aleutian Range is a major mountain range located in southwest Alaska. It extends from Chakachamna Lake (80 miles/130 km southwest of Anchorage) to Unimak Island, which is at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It includes all of the mountains of the Peninsula. The Aleutian Range is special because of its large number of active volcanoes, which are also part of the larger Aleutian Arc. The mainland part of the range is about 600 miles (1000 km) long. The Aleutian Islands are (geologically) a partially submerged western extension of the range that stretches for another 1,600 km (1000 mi). However the official designation &quot;Aleutian Range&quot; includes only the mainland peaks and the peaks on Unimak Island. The range is almost entirely roadless wilderness. Katmai National Park and Preserve, a large national park within the range, must be reached by boat or plane.

The core Aleutian Range can be divided into three mountain groups. Listed from southwest to northeast, they are:

* Mountains of the Alaska Peninsula and Unimak Island
* Chigmit Mountains
* Neacola Mountains

See Aleutian Islands for the continuation of the range to the west of Unimak Island. Just to the north of the Aleutian Range are the Tordrillo Mountains, the southeasternmost extent of the Alaska Range.

Selected mountains:
* Mount Redoubt (3,108 m), Chigmit Mountains
* Iliamna Volcano (3,054 m), Chigmit Mountains
* Mount Neacola, (2,873 m), Neacola Mountains
* Mount Shishaldin (2,857 m), Unimak Island
* Mount Pavlof (2,715 m), Alaska Peninsula
* Mount Veniaminof (2,508 m), Alaska Peninsula
* Isanotski Peaks (2,446 m), Unimak Island
* Mount Denison (2,318 m), Alaska Peninsula
* Mount Griggs, (2,317+ m), Alaska Peninsula
* Mount Douglas (2,153 m), Alaska Peninsula
* Mount Chiginagak (2,134 m), Alaska Peninsula
* Double Peak (2,078 m), Chigmit Mountains
* Mount Katmai (2,047 m), Alaska Peninsula
* Pogromni Volcano (2,002 m), Unimak Island

== Volcanic eruptions ==
Two volcanoes erupted during the summer of 2008 on the eastern Aleutian Islands. On July 12, 2008, Mount Okmok erupted, and it continued to erupt for a month. A giant, rapidly moving ash and gas cloud shot up to a height of 15,240 m as a result of this eruption.

Mount Kasatochi was home to the other eruption, which occurred on August 7 and 8. This eruption also sent up a gas cloud about 15,000 high. Together, these two power volcanic eruptions deposited emissions of trace gases an aerosols into the atmosphere. These emissions formed a sulfate aerosol layer that totaled a transfer of 1.6 Tg of SO2 into the stratosphere and disturbed flights over this area for a short period following the eruptions.

== Earthquakes ==
The 7.9 Mw Aleutian Islands earthquake occurred in June 2014 at an intermediate depth of 107 km. The quake was caused by oblique normal faulting along the Aleutian Trench, a convergent boundary where the Pacific plate is subducting underneath the North American plate at around 59 mm/year.

<doc id="251310" wikidata="Q2564307" url="?curid=251310" title="Jill Dando">
<text>Jill Wendy Dando (9 November 1961 – 26 April 1999) was an English journalist, television presenter and newsreader. She spent most of her career at the BBC and was the corporation&#x27;s Personality of the Year in 1997. At the time of her death, her television work included co-presenting the BBC One programme &quot;Crimewatch&quot; with Nick Ross.

On the morning of 26 April 1999, Dando was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, south-west London, prompting the biggest murder inquiry conducted by the Metropolitan Police and the country&#x27;s largest criminal investigation since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. A local man, Barry George, was convicted and imprisoned for the murder, but after eight years in prison he was acquitted following an appeal and retrial. No other suspect has been charged with Dando&#x27;s murder and the case remains unsolved.

==Early life==
Jill Wendy Dando was born at Ashcombe House Maternity Home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. She was the daughter of Jack Dando (February 1918 – February 2009) and Winifred Mary Jean Hockey (August 1928 – January 1986), who died of leukaemia aged 57. Her only sibling, brother Nigel (born 1952), worked as a journalist for BBC Radio Bristol before retiring in 2017, having previously worked as a journalist in local newspapers since the 1970s. Dando was raised as a Baptist and remained a devout follower. When she was three years old, it was discovered that she had a hole in her heart and a blocked pulmonary artery. She had heart surgery on 12 January 1965.

Dando was educated at Worle Infant School, Greenwood Junior School, Worle Community School, and Weston College Sixth Form, where she was head girl, and completed her A-levels. She then went on to study Journalism at the South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education.

Dando was a member of Weston-super-Mare Amateur Dramatic Society and Exeter Little Theatre Company, with whom she appeared in plays at the Barnfield Theatre. She was a volunteer at Sunshine Hospital Radio in Weston-super-Mare in 1979.

==Career==
Dando&#x27;s first job was as a trainee reporter for the local weekly newspaper, the &quot;Weston Mercury&quot;, where her father and brother worked. After five years as a print journalist, she started to work for the BBC, becoming a newsreader for BBC Radio Devon in 1985. That year, she transferred to BBC South West, where she presented a regional news magazine programme, &quot;Spotlight South West&quot;. In 1987, she worked for Television South West, then &quot;BBC Spotlight&quot; in Plymouth. In early 1988, Dando moved from regional to national television in London to present BBC television news, specifically the short on-the-hour bulletins that aired on both BBC1 and BBC2 from 1986 until the mid-1990s.

Dando presented the BBC television programmes &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;, &quot;Breakfast News&quot;, the &quot;BBC One O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, the travel programme &quot;Holiday&quot;, the crime appeal series &quot;Crimewatch&quot; (from 1995 until her death) and occasionally &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;. In 1994, she moved to Fulham. She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 8 November 1996. On 25 April 1999, Dando presented the first episode of &quot;Antiques Inspectors&quot;. She was scheduled to present the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on the evening of the following day. She was featured on the cover of that week&#x27;s &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine (from 24 to 30 April). Dando was also booked to host the British Academy Television Awards 1999, alongside Michael Parkinson, at Grosvenor House Hotel on 9 May. On 5 September, BBC One resumed airing of &quot;Antiques Inspectors&quot;, the final series to be recorded by Dando. The series had made its debut on 25 April, with filming of the final episode completed two days before that. The programme was cancelled following her death, but it was decided later in the year that it should be aired as a tribute to Dando. The final episode aired on 24 October.

At the time of her death, Dando was among those with the highest profile of the BBC&#x27;s on-screen staff, and had been the 1997 BBC Personality of the Year. &quot;Crimewatch&quot; reconstructed her murder in an attempt to aid the police in the search for her killer. After Barry George was charged with the murder but acquitted, &quot;Crimewatch&quot; made no further appeals for information concerning the case.

==Personal life==
From 1989 to 1996, Dando engaged in a relationship with BBC executive Bob Wheaton. She then had a brief relationship with national park warden Simon Basil. In December 1997, Dando met gynaecologist Alan Farthing, later Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s personal physician, on a blind date set up by a mutual friend. Farthing was separated from his wife at the time. A couple of months after Farthing&#x27;s divorce was finalised, the couple announced that they were engaged on 31 January 1999. Their wedding was set to take place on 25 September.

==Murder==
On the morning of 26 April 1999, 37-year-old Dando left Farthing&#x27;s home in Chiswick. She returned alone, by car, to the house she owned at 29 Gowan Avenue, Fulham. She had lived in the house, but by April 1999 was in the process of selling it and did not visit it frequently. The purpose of her visit was to collect contract documents which had been faxed to her there by her agent Jon Roseman. As Dando reached her front door at about 11:32 BST, she was shot once in the head. Her body was discovered about fourteen minutes later by neighbour Helen Doble. Police were called at 11:47. Dando was taken to the nearby Charing Cross Hospital where she was declared dead on arrival at 13:03.

Forensic study indicated that Dando had been shot by a bullet from a 9mm Short calibre semi-automatic pistol, with the gun pressed against her head at the moment of the shot. The cartridge appeared to have been subject to workshop modification, possibly to reduce its charge. Richard Hughes, her next-door neighbour, heard a scream from Dando (&quot;I thought it was someone surprising somebody&quot;) but heard no gunshot. Hughes looked out of his front window and, while not realising what had happened, made the only certain sighting of the killer — a six-foot-tall (183 cm) white man aged around 40, walking away from Dando&#x27;s house.

===Investigation===
After the murder, there was intense media coverage. An investigation by the Metropolitan Police, named Operation Oxborough, proved fruitless for over a year. Dando&#x27;s status as a well-known public figure had brought her into contact with thousands of people, and she was known to millions. There was huge speculation regarding the motive for her murder.

Within six months, the Murder Investigation Team had spoken to more than 2,500 people and taken more than 1,000 statements. With little progress after a year, the police concentrated their attention on Barry George, who lived about half a mile from Dando&#x27;s house. He had a history of stalking women, sexual offences and other antisocial and attention seeking behaviour. George was put under surveillance, arrested on 25 May 2000 and charged with Dando&#x27;s murder on 28 May.

George was tried at the Old Bailey, convicted, and on 2 July 2001 was sentenced to life imprisonment. Concern about this conviction was widespread on the basis that the case against George appeared thin. Two appeals were unsuccessful, but after discredited forensic evidence was excluded from the prosecution&#x27;s case, George&#x27;s third appeal succeeded in November 2007. The original conviction was quashed and a second trial lasting eight weeks ended in George&#x27;s acquittal on 1 August 2008.

After George&#x27;s acquittal, some newspapers published articles which appeared to suggest that he was guilty of the Dando murder and other offences against women. In December 2009, George accepted substantial damages from News Group Newspapers over articles in &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;News of the World&quot;, following a libel action in the High Court.

===Lines of inquiry===
Lines of inquiry explored in the police investigation included:
* Theories that a jealous ex-boyfriend or an unknown lover had killed Dando. This was quickly ruled out by the detectives who interviewed all Dando&#x27;s friends and acquaintances and checked her phone calls.
* A belief that somebody had hired an assassin to murder Dando as revenge for their being convicted as a result of evidence garnered by &quot;Crimewatch&quot; viewers. After exhaustive inquiries this was also ruled out by detectives.
* Various theories relating to Bosnian-Serb or Yugoslav groups in retaliation for NATO actions against media outlets and her appeals for aid during the Yugoslav Wars.
* The possibility that a deranged fan may have killed Dando after she had rejected his approaches. Dando&#x27;s brother, Nigel, informed detectives that she had become concerned by “some guy pestering her” in the few days before her death, but this was ruled out by detectives.
* A case of mistaken identity. This was judged unlikely, given that the killing took place on the doorstep of Dando&#x27;s own home.
* Following the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal a claim was made that Dando had investigated a paedophile ring at the BBC during the mid-1990s and had handed a dossier containing her findings to BBC management, purportedly prompting a revenge attack. The BBC said it had seen no evidence to support the claim.
* Actions taken by a professional rival or business partner also had to be considered. Her agent Jon Roseman stated that he had been interviewed as a suspect by police.

The original police investigation had explored the possibility of a contract killing, but since Dando was living with her fiancé and was only rarely visiting her Fulham residence, it was considered unlikely that a professional assassin would have been sufficiently well informed about Dando&#x27;s movements to have known at what time she was going to be there. CCTV evidence of Dando&#x27;s last journey (mainly security video recordings from a shopping centre in Hammersmith, which she visited on her way to Fulham) did not show any sign of her being followed.

Initial investigations focused on Dando&#x27;s personal circle since only a few people knew of her intention to visit her Gowan Avenue house on the day. Her agent Jon Roseman was an initial suspect since he knew Dando was going there to collect faxes he had sent her. But Roseman convinced detectives of his innocence. Bob Wheaton also attracted attention since he was a jilted lover and Dando had transferred £35,000 to him towards the end of their relationship. Wheaton stated that this transfer was a gift and not a loan. He also convinced detectives of his innocence.

On the night of her death, Dando&#x27;s BBC colleague Nick Ross said on &quot;Newsnight&quot; that retaliatory attacks by criminals against police, lawyers and judges were almost unknown in the UK. Forensic examination of the cartridge case and bullet recovered from the scene of the attack suggested that the weapon used had been the result of a workshop conversion of a replica or decommissioned gun. It was argued that a professional assassin would not use such a poor quality weapon. The police therefore soon began to favour the idea that the killing had been opportunistically carried out by a crazed individual. This assumed profile of the perpetrator led to the focus on George.

Cold case reviews by the police after 2008 concluded that Dando was killed by a professional assassin in a &quot;hard contact execution&quot;. Pressing the gun against her head would have acted as a suppressor — muffling the sound of the shot and preventing the killer from being splattered with blood.

===Yugoslav connection===
In early 1999, the UK and NATO were involved in the Kosovo War, opposing Serbia. Immediately after the Dando killing, a number of telephone calls were made to the BBC and other media outlets claiming responsibility for the killing on behalf of Serb groups. These calls stated that the murder was revenge for the NATO bombing campaign in Serbia, and threatened further killings. These calls were not judged wholly credible and may have been hoaxes. Nevertheless, at George&#x27;s first trial, his defence barrister, Michael Mansfield, proposed that the Serbian warlord Arkan had ordered Dando&#x27;s assassination in retaliation for the NATO bombing of the RTS headquarters. Mansfield suggested that Dando&#x27;s earlier presentation of an appeal for aid for Kosovar Albanian refugees may have attracted the attention of Bosnian-Serb hardliners. Dando&#x27;s appeal for aid for the Kosovar Albanian refugees had been shown on television three weeks before her murder.

In 2019, it was reported that the British National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) had given an intelligence report to the Dando murder enquiry claiming that the murder was in retaliation for the RTS bombing and Arkan had ordered the killing. The report highlighted a possible connection between the bullet used to kill Dando and bullets used in assassinations in Germany, namely handmade markings found on them. An opposition journalist, Slavko Ćuruvija, was assassinated outside his home in Belgrade just a few days before Dando&#x27;s murder and the method used in both cases was identical. In 2019, four men of the Serbian Secret Service were convicted of this murder. However, the verdicts were reversed on appeal in 2024, which led to a widely criticized acquittal of the four. In 2002, journalist Bob Woffinden had advanced the view that a Yugoslav group was behind the Dando killing and, in various newspaper articles, contested all the grounds on which the police had dismissed this possibility.

==Legacy==

Dando&#x27;s funeral took place on 21 May 1999 at Clarence Park Baptist Church in Weston-super-Mare. She was buried next to her mother in the town&#x27;s Ebdon Road Cemetery. Her father inherited all of her estate, valued at £607,000 after debts and taxes, because she died intestate.

Dando&#x27;s co-presenter Nick Ross proposed the formation of an academic institute in her name and, together with her fiancé Alan Farthing, raised almost £1.5 million. The Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science was founded at University College London on 26 April 2001, the second anniversary of her murder.

A memorial garden designed and realised by the BBC Television &quot;Ground Force&quot; team in Dando&#x27;s memory, using plants and colours that were special to her, is located within Grove Park, Weston-super-Mare, and was opened on 2 August 2001. The BBC set up a bursary award in Dando&#x27;s memory, which enables one student each year to study broadcast journalism at University College Falmouth. Sophie Long, who was then a postgraduate who had grown up in Weston-super-Mare and is now a presenter on BBC News, gained the first bursary award in 2000.

In 2007, Weston College opened a new university campus on the site of the former Broadoak Sixth Form Centre where Dando studied. The sixth-form building has been dedicated to her and named the Jill Dando Centre.

The life, death and subsequent police investigation of Jill Dando was the subject of a true crime Netflix miniseries titled &quot;Who Killed Jill Dando?&quot;, released in 2023 and running for a total of three 44-minute-long episodes. The miniseries received mixed reviews from critics, citing pacing issues, although the documentary&#x27;s usage of vintage archive footage from Dando&#x27;s career and early childhood were also noted as a point of interest. Critic Lucy Mangan drew attention to the details shared by Dando&#x27;s brother, Nigel, of the two siblings &quot;eating sand-blown lettuce sandwiches&quot; on the beach together and how this added to the thoroughness of the story presented. The miniseries also interviewed Barry George, who was 63 and living with his sister in Ireland at the time of filming. George stated, &quot;I live in Ireland now. It&#x27;s quiet here. You&#x27;re treated like a scab in London, but you&#x27;re not here.&quot;

<text>Visual Pinball (&quot;VP&quot;) is a freeware and source available video game engine for pinball tables and similar games such as pachinko machines. It includes a table editor as well as the simulator itself, and runs on Microsoft Windows. It can be used with Visual PinMAME, an emulator for ROM images from real pinball machines.

A huge variety of user-created VP tables are available on the internet. Players can choose between faithful recreations of existing pinball machines, with or without ROM emulation, and original pinball simulations based on licensed or completely original themes. VP&#x27;s scripting capabilities can also be used to create pinball-like games such as pitch-and-bat baseball, pinball bingo, bowling, cue sports, and pachinko.

VP can be used with common desktop PCs and monitors, but also supports &quot;virtual pinball&quot; cabinets, with various monitors and TVs used to display the playfield and backbox, similar to a real pinball machine. 3D televisions are supported; and recent versions support touch controls for playing on tablet computers and smartphones.

In February 2010, VP&#x27;s source code was released under a license allowing free non-commercial use.

== Design ==
Every Visual Pinball table includes two main parts: the &quot;physical&quot; playfield design, and the script that determines table gameplay, establishing the &quot;wiring&quot; of the emulation (through Visual PinMAME) to the table components such as lamps, switches and flippers. The editor uses Microsoft VBScript for user programming. VP itself is written in C++ with the Active Template Library for making ActiveX controls. VP is based on DirectX, so it can run on any Windows version from Windows 98 on, but most recent VP versions require at least Windows XP due to modern Microsoft compilers abandoning older versions of the OS.

== History ==
Visual Pinball was released to the public on December 19, 2000 by programmer Randy Davis.

In 2005, David R. Foley purchased rights from Davis for modification of the suite for a full-sized pinball cabinet based on the Visual Pinball software. Chicago Gaming purchased rights for licensed tables from Williams Electronics. The Visual PinMAME team and the Visual Pinball development community also joined in the effort to produce improvements to the suite product and a few tables. This project, known as UltraPin, was acquired by Global VR following the acquisition of certain assets UltraCade, and was discontinued in 2008.

In 2008, NanoTech Entertainment acquired VP rights from Davis to use and distribute the engine with its &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; PC Controller. They released version 9 of the engine back to the community, with many updates developed between 2005–2008. Version 9 includes major improvements, but incomplete backward compatibility, so some older tables still need VP version 8 to run properly.

In 2010, the source code of Visual Pinball 9.0.7 was released under a license allowing free non-commercial use, similar to the original MAME license. Davis and NanoTech are no longer involved in development as of (at least) version 9.0.8. Since then, development has been done by various open-source contributors.

Visual Pinball X (&quot;VPX&quot;) was released on December 24, 2015, again breaking backward compatibility with version 9; previously created tables can be loaded with it, but not played without changes. VPX brings significant improvements to graphics and the program&#x27;s physics engine.

In 2025, the re-integration of the VPVR fork into Visual Pinball 10.8.0 was finalized, which adds support for dynamic virtual camera movement, including Virtual reality headsets, and adding OpenGL as an alternative graphics API option. Due to the latter, Visual Pinball 10.8.1 (still in development) added support for operating systems other than Windows, including macOS, iOS, tvOS, Linux (incl. the Batocera distribution and the Raspberry Pi platform) and Android. These versions for now omit (most of) the user interface for creating tables, and focus on simulating/playing existing tables.

== Visual PinMAME ==
The simulation of most modern pinball machines (especially those made after 1992, using large portions of DMD animations and digital sound samples) requires the Visual PinMAME program (sometimes referred to as VPinMAME or VPM) to emulate physical machines as closely as possible. VPM increases Visual Pinball&#x27;s system requirements and, like other emulators, uses image files of actual ROMs from physical pinball machines, executing them as simulations of the embedded CPUs, sound chips and displays from the original machines. Since its 3.6 release, it also allows to physically simulate light bulb, LED and alphanumeric segment display behaviors to match the analogue circuits more closely. On top, flicker fusion is simulated to match human perception on real hardware. 

VPM is a program (a COM class) designed to work in combination with Visual Pinball (or nowadays, any other program that can use the COM class, e.g. &quot;Unit3D Pinball&quot;) to allow 3D renderings of actual pinball table designs. It is responsible for emulating CPUs and the connected ROMs used in modern pinball tables, as opposed to tables with electro-mechanical mechanisms that contain no ROMs or advanced ICs. VPM displays the LEDs or DMD of the machines in a separate window, and emulates integrated sound chips. To work properly with a rendered table, it requires that specific table&#x27;s ROM images.

VPM was written by a programming team including Steve Ellenoff, Tom Haukap, Martin Adrian and Gerrit Volkenborn, and was released on March 30, 2001 with version 0.99 beta. The underlying PinMAME core—which drives all emulation components, and is responsible for emulating LED displays, the DMD and playback of the emulated sound and music—was already started in April 1999. VPM is named after the original MAME program for emulating arcade games and is based on some parts of the MAME core .7X. The VPM project started as WPCMAMECOM (and its underlying core as WPCMAME, based on the WPC and MAME acronyms). VPM is written in the C++ programming language, whereas PinMAME is still based on C.

On August 1, 2008, the full source code of PinMAME 2.0 was made available to the public. Since then, development continues with the help of open-source contributors.

In 2017, the effort of making the PinMAME core interact with other programs through other APIs than the Windows exclusive COM was started (initially called PinMAMEdll). Over the years, this was further extended to result in a platform-independent library (libPinMAME) initially released in January 2021, that can be employed also on macOS, iOS, tvOS, Linux and Android, and in 32-bit and 64-bit flavors.

<doc id="251315" wikidata="Q352566" url="?curid=251315" title="Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford">
<text>Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, KG (16 January 1362 – 22 November 1392) was a favourite and court companion of King Richard II of England. He was the ninth Earl of Oxford and the first Duke of Ireland and the only Marquess of Dublin. He was also the first person to be created a Marquess.

==Early life==
Robert de Vere was the only son of Thomas de Vere, 8th Earl of Oxford and Maud de Ufford. He succeeded his father as earl in 1371, and was created Marquess of Dublin in 1385. The next year he was created Duke of Ireland. He was thus the first marquess, and only the second non-princely duke (after Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster in 1337), in England. King Richard&#x27;s close friendship with de Vere was disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl&#x27;s elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386.
His relationship with King Richard was very close and rumoured by Thomas Walsingham to be homosexual.

Robert, Duke of Ireland, was married to Philippa de Coucy, the King&#x27;s first cousin (her mother, Isabella, was the sister of the King&#x27;s father, Edward, the Black Prince and the eldest daughter of Edward III). Robert had an affair with Agnes de Launcekrona, a lady-in-waiting of Richard&#x27;s queen, Anne of Bohemia. In 1387, the couple were separated and eventually divorced; Robert took Launcekrona as his second wife.

==Downfall==
Since Robert was hugely unpopular with the other nobles and magnates, his close relationship with King Richard was one of the catalysts for the emergence of an organised opposition to Richard&#x27;s rule in the form of the Lords Appellant.

In 1387, Robert led Richard&#x27;s forces to defeat at the Battle of Radcot Bridge outside Oxford, against the forces of the Lords Appellant. He fled the field and his forces were left leaderless and compelled into ignominious surrender. He travelled abroad into exile after Radcot Bridge.

He was attainted and sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Merciless Parliament of 1388, which also made him forfeit his titles and lands. People associated with him were also affected, for the parliament dismissed his Irish Administration, composed of John Stanley, his deputy, who had been serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond, the governor, Bishop Alexander de Balscot of Meath, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and Sir Robert Crull, Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. 

==Death==
He died in or near Louvain in 1392 of injuries sustained during a boar hunt. Three years later, on the anniversary of his death, 22 November 1395, Richard II had his embalmed body brought back to England for burial. It was recorded by the chronicler Thomas Walsingham that many magnates did not attend the re-burial ceremony because they &#x27;had not yet digested their hatred&#x27; of him. The king had the coffin opened to kiss his lost friend&#x27;s hand and to gaze on his face one last time.

==Succession==
After Ireland&#x27;s death, his uncle Sir Aubrey de Vere, was restored to the family titles and estates, becoming 10th Earl of Oxford. The Marquessate of Dublin became extinct.

<text>The Chugach Mountains of southern Alaska are the northernmost of the several mountain ranges that make up the Pacific Coast Ranges of the western edge of North America. The range is about long and wide, and extends from the Knik and Turnagain Arms of the Cook Inlet on the west to Bering Glacier, Tana Glacier, and the Tana River on the east. It is bounded on the north by the Matanuska, Copper, and Chitina rivers. The highest point of the Chugach Mountains is Mount Marcus Baker, at , but with an average elevation of , most of its summits are not especially high. Even so, its position along the Gulf of Alaska ensures more snowfall in the Chugach than anywhere else in the world, an annual average of over 1500 cm (800 in).

The mountains are protected in the Chugach State Park and the Chugach National Forest. Near to Anchorage, they are a popular destination for outdoor activities.

The Richardson Highway, Seward Highway, Portage Glacier Highway, and the Glenn Highway run through the Chugach Mountains. The Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel of the Portage Glacier Highway provides railroad and automobile access underneath Maynard Mountain between Portage Lake and the city of Whittier on Prince William Sound.

On Mount Gordon Lyon, at about the level, is a five-pointed star using around 350 light globes. This faces Anchorage to be visible from the city at night. It is illuminated to commemorate Christmas, being lit from Thanksgiving until Christmas Day; and, on 9/11. Maintenance is undertaken by the US Air Force’s Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, although it was established in around 1960 and formerly maintained by the US Army having been near the former Army (Nike missile Site Summit) in the mountains.

==History==
The name &quot;Chugach&quot; comes from Chugach Sugpiaq &quot;Cuungaaciiq,&quot; Alaska Natives inhabiting the Kenai Peninsula and Prince William Sound on the south coast of Alaska. The Chugach people are an Alutiiq (Pacific Eskimo) people who speak the Chugach dialect of the Alutiiq language. In 1898 United States Army Captain William R. Abercrombie spelled the name &quot;Chugatch&quot; and applied it to the mountains. It is possible that the Koniagmiut (Sugpiat or Alutiit of the Kodiak Archipelago and the Alaska Peninsula) may also have called these northern Sugpiat &quot;Cuungaaciirmiut&quot; in ancient times but it is also possible that this was a neologism during Russian times.

==Mountains==

<doc id="251320" wikidata="Q27645375" url="?curid=251320" title="Sliced bread">
<text>Sliced bread is a loaf of bread that has been sliced with a machine and packaged for convenience, as opposed to the consumer cutting it with a knife. It was first sold in 1928, advertised as &quot;the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped&quot;. By 1933, around 80% of bread sold in the US was pre-sliced, leading to the popular idiom &quot;&quot;.

==History==

Otto Frederick Rohwedder of Davenport, Iowa, United States, invented the first single loaf bread-slicing machine. A prototype he built in 1912 was destroyed in a fire, and it was not until 1928 that Rohwedder had a fully working machine ready. The first commercial use of the machine was by the Chillicothe Baking Company of Chillicothe, Missouri, who sold their first slices on July 7, 1928. Their product, &quot;Kleen Maid Sliced Bread&quot;, proved to be a success. Battle Creek, Michigan, has a competing claim as the first city to sell bread sliced by Rohwedder&#x27;s machine; however, historians have produced no documentation backing up Battle Creek&#x27;s claim. The bread was advertised as &quot;the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped&quot;.

St. Louis baker Gustav Papendick bought Rohwedder&#x27;s second bread slicer and set out to improve it by devising a way to keep the slices together at least long enough to allow the loaves to be wrapped. After failures trying rubber bands and metal pins, he settled on placing the slices into a cardboard tray. The tray aligned the slices, allowing mechanized wrapping machines to function.

W.E. Long, who promoted the Holsum Bread brand, used by various independent bakers around the country, pioneered and promoted the packaging of sliced bread, beginning in 1928. In 1930, Wonder Bread, first sold in 1925, started marketing sliced bread nationwide.

In the United Kingdom, the first slicing and wrapping machine was installed in the Wonderloaf Bakery in Tottenham, London, in 1937. By the 1950s around 80% of bread sold in Britain was pre-sliced.

==Effects==
As commercially sliced bread resulted in uniform and somewhat thinner slices, people ate more slices of bread at a time. They also ate bread more frequently, because of the ease of getting and eating another piece of bread. This increased consumption of bread and, in turn, increased consumption of spreads, such as jam, to put on the bread.

==1943 U.S. ban==
In 1943, U.S. officials imposed a short-lived ban on sliced bread as a wartime conservation measure. The ban was ordered by Secretary of Agriculture Claude R. Wickard, who held the position of Food Administrator, and took effect on January 18, 1943. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, officials explained that &quot;the ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if it is not to dry out.&quot; It was also intended to counteract a rise in the price of bread, caused by the Office of Price Administration&#x27;s authorization of a ten percent increase in flour prices.

In a Sunday radio address on January 24th, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia suggested that bakeries that had their own bread-slicing machines should be allowed to continue to use them, and on January 26th, 1943, a letter appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from a distraught housewife:

I should like to let you know how important sliced bread is to the morale and saneness of a household. My husband and four children are all in a rush during and after breakfast. Without ready-sliced bread I must do the slicing for toast—two pieces for each one—that&#x27;s ten. For their lunches I must cut by hand at least twenty slices, for two sandwiches apiece. Afterward I make my own toast. Twenty-two slices of bread to be cut in a hurry!

On January 26th, however, John F. Conaboy, the New York Area Supervisor of the Food Distribution Administration, warned bakeries, delicatessens, and other stores that were continuing to slice bread to stop, saying that &quot;to protect the cooperating bakeries against the unfair competition of those who continue to slice their own bread... we are prepared to take stern measures if necessary.&quot;

On March 8th, 1943, the ban was rescinded. While public outcry is generally credited for the reversal, Wickard stated that &quot;Our experience with the order, however, leads us to believe that the savings are not as much as we expected, and the War Production Board tells us that sufficient wax paper to wrap sliced bread for four months is in the hands of paper processor and the baking industry.&quot;

A theory of the ban was that the bread slicing machines used replaceable hardened steel for the slicers. This type of steel was essential to the war effort. Rather than to try monitoring production and usage of this type of steel, preventing the sale of sliced bread would stifle demand from bakeries for fresh slicers, thereby making the steel more available to the war effort.

==Around the world==

Due to its convenience, sliced bread is popular in many parts of the world, and the usual thickness varies by company and country:

* In the United Kingdom, sliced bread is sold as &quot;Extra Thick&quot;, &quot;Thick&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; or &quot;Thin&quot;, ranging from 16 mm down to 10 mm.
* In the Republic of Ireland, the most popular bread type is known as &quot;sliced pan&quot;, sold in 800- or 400-gram loaves, wrapped in wax paper.
* In Japan, the same half-loaf of bread is labeled by the number of slices it is cut into (commonly a four or six cut, but also eight or ten), meaning a higher number is a thinner cut. Whole cut loaves are rarely seen. Thin sliced crustless &quot;sandwich bread&quot; is also sold in Japan, since regular four–six slice bread is deemed too thick.
* In Canada and the United States, Texas toast is a type of packaged bread sliced twice as thick as most sliced bread.
* In Australia most sliced bread slices are about 18 mm thick, known as &quot;toast&quot; thickness, while 12–13 mm is known as &quot;sandwich&quot;. Less common is &quot;café&quot; thickness, about 24 mm.

==In popular culture==
The phrase &quot;&quot; is a common idiom used to praise an invention or development. A writer for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; wrote that &quot;the phrase is the ultimate depiction of innovative achievement and American know-how.&quot;

In 1933, an advertisement for a bread offering thick and thin slices in the same loaf called it &quot;the first improvement since sliced bread&quot;. In 1940, a package of bread consisting of two wrapped sliced half-loaves was advertised as the &quot;greatest convenience since sliced bread&quot;.

<doc id="251323" wikidata="Q1058270" url="?curid=251323" title="Emotivism">
<text>Emotivism is a meta-ethical view that claims that ethical sentences do not express propositions but emotional attitudes. Hence, it is colloquially known as the hurrah/boo theory. Influenced by the growth of analytic philosophy and logical positivism in the 20th century, the theory was stated vividly by A. J. Ayer in his 1936 book &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot;, but its development owes more to C. L. Stevenson.

Emotivism can be considered a form of non-cognitivism or expressivism. It stands in opposition to other forms of non-cognitivism (such as quasi-realism and universal prescriptivism), as well as to all forms of cognitivism (including both moral realism and ethical subjectivism).

In the 1950s, emotivism appeared in a modified form in the universal prescriptivism of R. M. Hare.

==History==

Emotivism reached prominence in the early 20th century, but it was born centuries earlier. In 1710, George Berkeley wrote that language in general often serves to inspire feelings as well as communicate ideas. Decades later, David Hume espoused ideas similar to Stevenson&#x27;s later ones. In his 1751 book &quot;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals&quot;, Hume considered morality not to be related to fact but &quot;determined by sentiment&quot;:

G. E. Moore published his &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; in 1903 and argued that the attempts of ethical naturalists to translate ethical terms (like &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;) into non-ethical ones (like &quot;pleasing&quot; and &quot;displeasing&quot;) committed the &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot;. Moore was a cognitivist, but his case against ethical naturalism steered other philosophers toward noncognitivism, particularly emotivism.

The emergence of logical positivism and its verifiability criterion of meaning early in the 20th century led some philosophers to conclude that ethical statements, being incapable of empirical verification, were cognitively meaningless. This criterion was fundamental to A. J. Ayer&#x27;s defense of positivism in &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot;, which contains his statement of emotivism. However, positivism is not essential to emotivism itself, perhaps not even in Ayer&#x27;s form, and some positivists in the Vienna Circle, which had great influence on Ayer, held non-emotivist views.

R. M. Hare unfolded his ethical theory of universal prescriptivism in 1952&#x27;s &quot;The Language of Morals&quot;, intending to defend the importance of rational moral argumentation against the &quot;propaganda&quot; he saw encouraged by Stevenson, who thought moral argumentation was sometimes psychological and not rational. But Hare&#x27;s disagreement was not universal, and the similarities between his noncognitive theory and the emotive one — especially his claim, and Stevenson&#x27;s, that moral judgments contain commands and are thus not purely descriptive — caused some to regard him as an emotivist, a classification he denied:

==Proponents==
Influential statements of emotivism were made by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards in their 1923 book on language, &quot;The Meaning of Meaning&quot;, and by W. H. F. Barnes and A. Duncan-Jones in independent works on ethics in 1934. However, it is the later works of Ayer and especially Stevenson that are the most developed and discussed defenses of the theory.

===A. J. Ayer===

A. J. Ayer&#x27;s version of emotivism is given in chapter six, &quot;Critique of Ethics and Theology&quot;, of &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot;. In that chapter, Ayer divides &quot;the ordinary system of ethics&quot; into four classes:
#&quot;Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions&quot;
#&quot;Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes&quot;
#&quot;Exhortations to moral virtue&quot;
#&quot;Actual ethical judgments&quot;
He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy. While class three statements were irrelevant to Ayer&#x27;s brand of emotivism, they would later play a significant role in Stevenson&#x27;s.

Ayer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition as &quot;worthless&quot; for determining moral truths, since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are &quot;mere pseudo-concepts&quot;:

Ayer agrees with subjectivists in saying that ethical statements are necessarily &quot;related&quot; to individual attitudes, but he says they lack truth value because they cannot be properly understood as &quot;propositions&quot; about those attitudes; Ayer thinks ethical sentences are &quot;expressions&quot;, not &quot;assertions&quot;, of approval. While an assertion of approval may always be accompanied by an expression of approval, expressions can be made without making assertions; Ayer&#x27;s example is boredom, which can be expressed through the stated assertion &quot;I am bored&quot; or through non-assertions including tone of voice, body language, and various other verbal statements. He sees ethical statements as expressions of the latter sort, so the phrase &quot;Theft is wrong&quot; is a non-propositional sentence that is an expression of disapproval but is not equivalent to the proposition &quot;I disapprove of theft&quot;.

Having argued that his theory of ethics is noncognitive and not subjective, he accepts that his position and subjectivism are equally confronted by G. E. Moore&#x27;s argument that ethical disputes are clearly genuine disputes and not just expressions of contrary feelings. Ayer&#x27;s defense is that all ethical disputes are about &quot;facts&quot; regarding the proper application of a value system to a specific case, not about the value systems themselves, because any dispute about values can only be resolved by judging that one value system is superior to another, and this judgment itself presupposes a shared value system. If Moore is wrong in saying that there are actual disagreements of &quot;value&quot;, we are left with the claim that there are actual disagreements of &quot;fact&quot;, and Ayer accepts this without hesitation:

===C. L. Stevenson===
Stevenson&#x27;s work has been seen both as an elaboration upon Ayer&#x27;s views and as a representation of one of &quot;two broad types of ethical emotivism.&quot; An analytic philosopher, Stevenson suggested in his 1937 essay &quot;The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms&quot; that any ethical theory should explain three things: that intelligent disagreement can occur over moral questions, that moral terms like &quot;good&quot; are &quot;magnetic&quot; in encouraging action, and that the scientific method is insufficient for verifying moral claims. Stevenson&#x27;s own theory was fully developed in his 1944 book &quot;Ethics and Language&quot;. In it, he agrees with Ayer that ethical sentences express the speaker&#x27;s feelings, but he adds that they also have an &quot;imperative&quot; component intended to change the listener&#x27;s feelings and that this component is of greater importance. Where Ayer spoke of &quot;values&quot;, or fundamental psychological inclinations, Stevenson speaks of &quot;attitudes&quot;, and where Ayer spoke of disagreement of &quot;fact&quot;, or rational disputes over the application of certain values to a particular case, Stevenson speaks of differences in &quot;belief&quot;; the concepts are the same. Terminology aside, Stevenson interprets ethical statements according to two patterns of analysis.

====First pattern analysis====
Under his first pattern of analysis an ethical statement has two parts: a declaration of the speaker&#x27;s attitude and an imperative to mirror it, so &quot;&#x27;This is good&#x27; means &quot;I approve of this; do so as well.&quot;&quot; The first half of the sentence is a proposition, but the imperative half is not, so Stevenson&#x27;s translation of an ethical sentence remains a noncognitive one.

Imperatives cannot be &quot;proved&quot;, but they can still be &quot;supported&quot; so that the listener understands that they are not wholly arbitrary:

The purpose of these supports is to make the listener understand the consequences of the action they are being commanded to do. Once they understand the command&#x27;s consequences, they can determine whether or not obedience to the command will have desirable results.

====Second pattern analysis====
Stevenson&#x27;s second pattern of analysis is used for statements about &quot;types&quot; of actions, not specific actions. Under this pattern,

In second-pattern analysis, rather than judge an action directly, the speaker is evaluating it according to a general principle. For instance, someone who says &quot;Murder is wrong&quot; might mean &quot;Murder decreases happiness overall&quot;; this is a second-pattern statement that leads to a first-pattern one: &quot;I disapprove of anything that decreases happiness overall. Do so as well.&quot;

====Methods of argumentation====
For Stevenson, moral disagreements may arise from different fundamental attitudes, different moral beliefs about specific cases, or both. The methods of moral argumentation he proposed have been divided into three groups, known as &quot;logical&quot;, &quot;rational psychological&quot; and &quot;nonrational psychological&quot; forms of argumentation.

Logical methods involve efforts to show inconsistencies between a person&#x27;s fundamental attitudes and their particular moral beliefs. For example, someone who says &quot;Edward is a good person&quot; who has previously said &quot;Edward is a thief&quot; and &quot;No thieves are good people&quot; is guilty of inconsistency until he retracts one of his statements. Similarly, a person who says &quot;Lying is always wrong&quot; might consider lies in some situations to be morally permissible, and if examples of these situations can be given, his view can be shown to be logically inconsistent.

Rational psychological methods examine facts that relate fundamental attitudes to particular moral beliefs; the goal is not to show that someone has been inconsistent, as with logical methods, but only that they are wrong about the facts that connect their attitudes to their beliefs. To modify the former example, consider the person who holds that all thieves are bad people. If she sees Edward pocket a wallet found in a public place, she may conclude that he is a thief, and there would be no inconsistency between her attitude (that thieves are bad people) and her belief (that Edward is a bad person because he is a thief). However, it may be that Edward recognized the wallet as belonging to a friend, to whom he promptly returned it. Such a revelation would likely change the observer&#x27;s belief about Edward, and even if it did not, the attempt to reveal such facts would count as a rational psychological form of moral argumentation.

Non-rational psychological methods revolve around language with psychological influence but no necessarily logical connection to the listener&#x27;s attitudes. Stevenson called the primary such method &quot;&#x27;persuasive,&#x27; in a somewhat broadened sense&quot;, and wrote:

Persuasion may involve the use of particular emotion-laden words, like &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;dictator&quot;, or hypothetical questions like &quot;What if everyone thought the way you do?&quot; or &quot;How would you feel if you were in their shoes?&quot;

==Criticism==
Utilitarian philosopher Richard Brandt offered several criticisms of emotivism in his 1959 book &quot;Ethical Theory&quot;. His first is that &quot;ethical utterances are not obviously the kind of thing the emotive theory says they are, and prima facie, at least, should be viewed as statements.&quot; He thinks that emotivism cannot explain why most people, historically speaking, have considered ethical sentences to be &quot;fact-stating&quot; and not just emotive. Furthermore, he argues that people who change their moral views see their prior views as mistaken, not just different, and that this does not make sense if their attitudes were all that changed:

James Urmson&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;The Emotive Theory of Ethics&quot; also disagreed with many of Stevenson&#x27;s points in &quot;Ethics and Language&quot;, &quot;a work of great value&quot; with &quot;a few serious mistakes [that] led Stevenson consistently to distort his otherwise valuable insights&quot;.

===Magnetic influence===
Brandt criticized what he termed &quot;the &#x27;magnetic influence&#x27; thesis&quot;, the idea of Stevenson that ethical statements are meant to influence the listener&#x27;s attitudes. Brandt contends that most ethical statements, including judgments of people who are not within listening range, are &quot;not&quot; made with the intention to alter the attitudes of others. Twenty years earlier, Sir William David Ross offered much the same criticism in his book &quot;Foundations of Ethics&quot;. Ross suggests that the emotivist theory seems to be coherent only when dealing with simple linguistic acts, such as recommending, commanding, or passing judgement on something happening at the same point of time as the utterance.

According to this view, it would make little sense to translate a statement such as &quot;Galileo should not have been forced to recant on heliocentricism&quot; into a command, imperative, or recommendation - to do so might require a radical change in the meaning of these ethical statements. Under this criticism, it would appear as if emotivist and prescriptivist theories are only capable of converting a relatively small subset of all ethical claims into imperatives.

Like Ross and Brandt, Urmson disagrees with Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;causal theory&quot; of emotive meaning—the theory that moral statements only have &quot;emotive&quot; meaning when they are made to change in a listener&#x27;s attitude—saying that is incorrect in explaining &quot;evaluative force in purely causal terms&quot;. This is Urmson&#x27;s fundamental criticism, and he suggests that Stevenson would have made a stronger case by explaining emotive meaning in terms of &quot;commending and recommending attitudes&quot;, not in terms of &quot;the power to evoke attitudes&quot;.

Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Ethics and Language&quot;, written after Ross&#x27;s book but before Brandt&#x27;s and Urmson&#x27;s, states that emotive terms are &quot;not always used for purposes of exhortation.&quot; For example, in the sentence &quot;Slavery was good in Ancient Rome&quot;, Stevenson thinks one is speaking of past attitudes in an &quot;almost purely descriptive&quot; sense. And in some discussions of &quot;current&quot; attitudes, &quot;agreement in attitude can be taken for granted,&quot; so a judgment like &quot;He was wrong to kill them&quot; might describe one&#x27;s attitudes yet be &quot;emotively inactive&quot;, with no real emotive (or imperative) meaning. Stevenson is doubtful that sentences in such contexts qualify as &quot;normative&quot; ethical sentences, maintaining that &quot;for the contexts that are most typical of normative ethics, the ethical terms have a function that is &quot;both&quot; emotive and descriptive.&quot;

=== Philippa Foot&#x27;s moral realism ===
Philippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a &quot;committal in a new dimension.&quot; She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word &quot;injury&quot;. Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, have not we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?

Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
===Standard using and standard setting===
As an offshoot of his fundamental criticism of Stevenson&#x27;s magnetic influence thesis, Urmson wrote that ethical statements had two functions—&quot;standard using&quot;, the application of accepted values to a particular case, and &quot;standard setting&quot;, the act of proposing certain values as those that &quot;should&quot; be accepted—and that Stevenson confused them. According to Urmson, Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;I approve of this; do so as well&quot; is a standard-setting statement, yet most moral statements are actually standard-&quot;using&quot; ones, so Stevenson&#x27;s explanation of ethical sentences is unsatisfactory. Colin Wilks has responded that Stevenson&#x27;s distinction between first-order and second-order statements resolves this problem: a person who says &quot;Sharing is good&quot; may be making a second-order statement like &quot;Sharing is approved of by the community&quot;, the sort of standard-using statement Urmson says is most typical of moral discourse. At the same time, their statement can be reduced to a first-order, standard-setting sentence: &quot;I approve of whatever is approved of by the community; do so as well.&quot;

<doc id="251324" wikidata="Q889598" url="?curid=251324" title="Stephen Miller (Minnesota governor)">
<text>Stephen Miller (January 7, 1816August 18, 1881) was an American Republican politician. He was the first Civil War veteran to serve as Minnesota Governor. He was the fourth Governor of Minnesota.

==Early years and business entrepreneur==
Born in Carroll Township, Pennsylvania, Stephen Miller established a series of successful businesses. Frail health prompted the entrepreneur, of Pennsylvania Dutch heritage, to leave home at age 42 and follow his friend Alexander Ramsey to Minnesota, where the climate reportedly was more congenial. Miller established a mercantile business in St. Cloud and, within two years, had risen to prominence in the state Republican Party.

==Civil War soldier and leader==
During the Civil War, Miller, a middle-aged soldier with no previous military experience, advanced rapidly from the rank of private to colonel in the 1st Minnesota Infantry. In 1862 Miller returned from the South and replaced Brig. Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley as commander of Mankato&#x27;s Camp Lincoln. There, 303 Dakota men, convicted of participating in the Dakota War of 1862, awaited their fate. Four months later, Miller supervised, by order of President Lincoln, the mass execution of 38 Dakotas condemned for their part in the war.

==Governor of Minnesota==
His military career and Alexander Ramsey&#x27;s support assured Miller of a gubernatorial victory in 1863. He was the 4th Governor of Minnesota, serving from January 11, 1864, to January 8, 1866. He was the first of several Civil War veterans to serve as Governor of Minnesota. Although lacking a college degree himself, he valued higher education and advocated generous appropriations to the University of Minnesota and to state normal schools, one of which evolved into St. Cloud State University. In his final address to the legislature, he strongly but unsuccessfully urged adoption of a black suffrage amendment to the state constitution.

==Later years and term as state representative==
Miller chose not to run for re-election and was unemployed until 1871, when he became a railroad-company field agent in Windom. He served as a state representative from January 7, 1873, to January 5, 1874, representing then-District 38, which included all or portions of Cottonwood, Jackson, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone and Rock counties in the southwestern part of the state. During his term, he was chair of the House&#x27;s Public Lands Committee. In 1876, he was a representative to the Electoral College. The one-time war hero and popular governor died alone, an impoverished widower, in Worthington in 1881.

<text>William Rainey Marshall (October 17, 1825January 8, 1896) was an American politician. He was the fifth Governor of Minnesota from January 8, 1866, to January 9, 1870, and was a member of the Republican party. He served as an officer in the 7th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War (1861–1865).

He was born in Columbia, Missouri. Marshall first settled in Illinois and Wisconsin, where he mined for lead and surveyed land. He was elected to serve in the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 1st Wisconsin Legislature in 1848 as a Democrat, but his seat was successfully contested by Joseph Bowron, because his home in St. Croix Falls was on the west (Minnesota Territory) side of the new state line. In 1849 he crossed the St. Croix River to settle in St. Paul, soon home of his fledgling hardware business. He served a term in the first Minnesota territorial legislature, and his reputation grew when he served as chairman of the convention that founded the state&#x27;s Republican Party.

The one-time banker, dairy farmer, stock-raiser, and newspaper publisher volunteered to fight in both the Civil War and the Dakota War of 1862. He enlisted as a private in the 8th Minnesota and was quickly appointed lieutenant colonel of the 7th Minnesota on August 28, 1862. He fought in many of the battles of the Dakota War being promoted to colonel of his regiment on November 6, 1863. Marshall and his regiment were transferred to Andrew Jackson Smith&#x27;s command in Missouri and took part in the pursuit of Sterling Price. Smith&#x27;s command was attached to George H. Thomas&#x27; army outside Nashville. When Colonel Sylvester G. Hill was killed the first day of the battle of Nashville, Colonel Marshall took command of Hill&#x27;s brigade and led it throughout the rest of the battle. He continued in brigade command when transferred to Mobile, Alabama, to take part in the Battle of Fort Blakeley. Colonel Marshall was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers, dated March 13, 1865.

Marshall won the 1865 and 1867 gubernatorial elections. As governor, he repeatedly urged passage of a black suffrage amendment. After defeating it twice, the legislature finally adopted the amendment and inspired Marshall to declare that the &quot;free young state of Minnesota&quot; is &quot;now altogether free.&quot; During William Marshall&#x27;s administration, his adoptive state experienced a post-Civil-War surge of growth and development: its population doubled to 350,000, its railroad mileage quadrupled, and its commercial endeavors flourished.

After leaving office, Marshall remained active in both the private and public sectors as an attorney, banker, and as a railroad and land commissioner. He was a partner in a law firm with Jude Kerr and Robertson Howard while residing in St. Paul, but subsequent commercial ventures faltered, as did his health. He moved to California in 1894 and died there two years later, in Pasadena on January 8, 1896. He was buried at Oakland Cemetery in Saint Paul. He is listed as one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism.

In Minnesota, Marshall County and the city of Marshall were both named after him.

<doc id="251327" wikidata="Q448586" url="?curid=251327" title="Fra Dolcino">
<text>Fra Dolcino (c. 1250 – 1307) was the second leader of the Dulcinian reformist movement who was burned at the stake in Northern Italy in 1307. He had taken over the movement after its founder, Gerard Segarelli, had also been executed in 1300 on the orders of the Roman Catholic Church. Although the beliefs and spirituality of the Dulcinian sect were inspired by the teachings of Francis of Assisi, who had founded the Franciscan Order in 1210, their beliefs were condemned as heresy by the Catholic Church. The Papacy condemned their practices of poverty, liberty, and opposition to the feudal system.

==Real name==
The origins of Fra Dolcino and his real name are a subject of constant debate among historians. One view is that he belonged to the wealthy Tornielli family of Novara, while another view is that he was the illegitimate son of a priest who fled from Vercelli to escape punishment for some small burglaries.

Recent research by Raniero Orioli presents a plausible theory: the paper of the Anonymous Synchronous (an &quot;anonymous contemporary&quot;) written shortly after the facts, identifies him as &quot;nomine Dulcinus, filius presbyteri Iulii de Tarecontano Vallis Ossole diocesis Novariensis&quot; (by name Dulcinus, son of presbyter Julius from Tarecontano of the Ossola Valley in the diocese of Novara); a few years later the inquisitor Bernardo Gui in his work on heretical sects reports the same information changing the word &quot;presbyteri&quot; to &quot;sacerdotis&quot; (priest) thus concluding that he was the illegitimate son of a priest. The research of Orioli shows that &quot;De Julio Presbitero&quot; was actually the name of a wealthy family of Vercelli belonging to the Ghibellines, who often married members of the Tornielli family of nearby Novara (Romagnano Sesia), also Ghibellines, so he proposes that Dolcino could be the son of a couple that united members of both families.

==History==
Benvenuto da Imola in his commentaries written less than a century after the fact tells us that Dolcino was born in Romagnano Sesia, went in his childhood to Vercelli and there lived in the church of St. Agnes where he studied grammar. He was very intelligent and proficient in the studies, of short stature, always smiling and of gentle temperament. One day a priest lamented that some money had been stolen and accused one of his familiars, Patras, of the theft; he in turn accused Dolcino and wanted him tortured to make him confess. The priests refused and did not accuse him of anything but Dolcino was terrorized and fled far away to the city of Trento where he met and joined the sect of the Apostolics. Dolcino left Vercelli between 1280 and 1290 and the research of Orioli shows that in the same period, the fights between Guelphs and Ghibellines caused many victims on both sides in the city; the fear of being involved in these fights could better explain his decision to leave and join the initially pacifist movement of Segarelli. The inquisitor Bernardo Gui cites the same episode, concluding that he fled to Trento to escape the just punishment for his burglaries.

Fra Dolcino, a former member, became in 1300 the leader of the movement of Apostolics, and influenced by the millenarist theories of Gioacchino da Fiore gave birth to the Dulcinian movement, which existed between the years 1300 and 1307. It ended in the mountains in Sesia Valley and in the Biella area, in Piedmont, Italy, on 23 March 1307 when many crusaders (&quot;multi crucesignati&quot;) finally conquered the fortification built on the mount Rubello by the Dulcinians.

According to the Roman Catholic Church and most historians of the period, Dolcino and his followers, in reaction to attacks by Catholic troops, became criminals (today they would probably be called guerrilla fighters), who would not hesitate, for their own survival, to plunder and devastate villages, killing any who opposed them, and burning their houses. He justified the actions committed by his followers in this period citing Saint Paul (Epistle to Titus 1:15): &quot;To the pure all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are corrupted&quot;, as reported by the Anonymous Synchronous Dolcino maintained: &quot;[...] that it was legitimate for him and his followers to hang, behead, [...] people who obey to the Roman church and burn down, destroy, [...] because they were acting to redeem them and thus without sin&quot;.

Despite this, he was considered by some to be one of the reformers of the Church and one of the founders of the ideals of the French Revolution and socialism. In particular he was positively reevaluated toward the end of the 19th century and was dubbed the &quot;Apostle of the Socialist Jesus&quot; and thus in 1907 left wing workers of Biella and the Sesia Valley erected a monument on mount Rubello, the place of its last resistance. The monument was later (1927) symbolically gunned down by the Fascists and rebuilt in a smaller size and different shape in 1974.

==Execution==
Fra Dolcino and his co-preacher or concubine Margaret of Trent were never tried by the Church. Manly Hall claims (as do many other modern writers) that Dolcino was castrated and torn to pieces, limb by limb, the pieces afterwards burned by the public executioner. This is apparently not based on any contemporary or near contemporary account of Fra Dolcino&#x27;s execution. Fifteen years later (in 1322), approximately thirty of Dolcino&#x27;s disciples were burned alive in the marketplace at Padua. After his capture the Bishop of Vercelli consulted with the Inquisition and other eminent people to decide on an immediate execution (in fact the acts of the trial were never found, despite some suggestions that they could be hidden somewhere in the secret archives of the Vatican) so the paper of the Anonymous Synchronous, probably written by a follower or a local sympathizer of the Dulcinian, the one of Bernardo Gui and another anonymous paper (probably also written by Bernardo Gui) are the only documents we have that were written in the same period the events took place.

==Ideas==
He was considered to have been an intelligent, erudite and charismatic speaker. He expressed his ideas in a series of letters he wrote to the Apostolics from 1300 to 1307; his letters were found by the Inquisition and are deeply analyzed (and confuted) in the paper &quot;Additamentum ad Historiam fratris Dulcini, haeretici&quot;, written by an Inquisitor.

==Cultural references==
In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, actually written &quot;after&quot; Fra Dolcino&#x27;s death but &quot;as if&quot; it were before it, Mohammed talks about Dolcino (&quot;Inferno&quot; XXVIII):

Fra Dolcino and his former followers are mentioned often in Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. The dialogue between the narrator Adso and the old priest Ubertino recounts the story of Fra Dolcino in outline, leaving much to the imagination of the reader. Bernardo Gui also figures in the novel, as do Dolcino&#x27;s papers.

In &quot;On Liberty&quot;, John Stuart Mill uses Fra Dolcino as an example of the inability of truth to triumph over persecution.

Dario Fo&#x27;s &quot;Mistero Buffo&quot; includes an episode that recounts the story of Fra Dolcino&#x27;s rebellion.

<text>The Daifang Commandery was an administrative division established by the Chinese Han dynasty on the Korean Peninsula between 204 and 220. It was conquered by Goguryeo in 314.

== History ==
Gongsun Kang, a warlord in Liaodong, separated the southern half from the Lelang commandery and established the Daifang commandery sometime between 204 and 220 to make administration more efficient. He controlled southern natives with Daifang instead of Lelang.

In 238 under the order of Emperor Ming of Cao Wei, Sima Yi defeated the Gongsun family and annexed Liaodong, Lelang and Daifang to Wei. A dispute over the control of southern natives caused their revolt. The armies of Lelang and Daifang eventually stifled it.

Daifang Commandery was inherited by the Jin dynasty. Due to the bitter civil War of the Eight Princes, Jin became unable to control the Korean peninsula at the beginning of the 4th century. Zhang Tong (張統) broke away from Jin in Lelang and Daifang. After Luoyang, the capital of Jin, was occupied by the Xiongnu in 311, he went for help to Murong Hui, a Xianbei warlord, with his subjects in 314. Goguryeo under King Micheon annexed Lelang and Daifang soon after that.

== Area ==

The Daifang Commandery was located around Hwanghae and its capital was Daifang County. However, the controversy over its location is not resolved yet. According to a Chinese official chronicle, the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; (晉書), it had the following seven counties (縣, &quot;xian&quot;):

*Daifang (帶方)
*Liekou (列口)
*Nanxin (南新)
*Changcen (長岑)
*Tixi (提奚)
*Hanzi (含資)
*Haiming (海冥)

<doc id="251333" wikidata="Q702143" url="?curid=251333" title="Hong Ta-gu">
<text>Hong Ta-gu (; 1244–1291) was a Goryeo commander of the Yuan dynasty. His given name was Chun-gi (俊奇; 준기, Jùnqí), but he was more well known by his courtesy name Ta-gu. Born to a northwestern warlord family that defected to the Mongol Empire, Hong Ta-gu led Goryeo forces who had defected in campaigns against Goryeo and Japan. The Hong family dominated the Goryeo defector families in Liaoyang and Shenyang during the latter half of the 13th century.

==Early life==
Hong Ta-gu, originally named Chun-gi, was born in 1244 to Hong Pok-wŏn, a northwestern Goryeo warlord who defected to the Mongol Empire in 1231. He entered the military at a young age and managed to impress Kublai, who later became the founder of the Yuan dynasty, with his courage and military prowess. Kublai gave Chun-gi the courtesy name of Ta-gu.

==Mongol service==
Hong Ta-gu was arrested soon after his father&#x27;s death in 1260 for trying to provoke conflict between Goryeo and the Mongols by saying that the Goryeo king had lied about his intentions to move the capital back to Kaesong. In 1261, Kublai summoned Hong Ta-gu and told him that his father had been unjustly punished. Hong Ta-gu was made &quot;chonggwan&quot; of the Goryeo warriors. This was probably due to political considerations. There were a few tens of thousands of Goryeo warriors in Liaoyang and Shenyang, and Kublai demanded their loyalty under threat of punishment for their families.

In 1263, Hong Ta-gu reported that Wang Jun, the Goryeo royal in command of Goryeo families in Shenyang, boasted that his position was no less than that of the heir apparent. Wang Jun&#x27;s command was stripped and given to Hong.

According to Goryeo sources, Hong &quot;hated his motherland&quot;. In 1269, when Im Yon attempted to remove Wonjong from power, Hong received orders to invade Goryeo with 3,300 men. This campaign opened up Goryeo to direct Yuan management of internal affairs and Hong and his Goryeo warriors became one of the primary instruments of such policy for about ten years. In 1270, he was part of the negotiations behind marrying the Goryeo king to a Mongol princess. In 1271, he participated in the suppression of the Sambyeolcho Rebellion with particular zeal. Wang Jun had instructed his sons, who participated in the campaign, to save Wang On, a Goryeo prince who the rebels had named their king. Hong was the first to land on Jindo Island to attack the rebel base and he personally killed Wang On. He also refused to bow to the Goryeo king when he visited court that year. In 1273, Hong carried out the mass slaughter of rebel prisoners when Yuan and Goryeo troops took Tamna, the last stronghold of the Sambyeolcho.

Hong participated in the Mongol invasions of Japan. In April 1274, the Yuan instructed Holdon and Hong Ta-gu to mobilize 15,000 men for the invasion of Japan. Hong was put in charge of the construction of large transports and was harsh and cruel in exploiting the Goryeo people for the project. Hong&#x27;s people looted Goryeo dwellings while preparing for the invasion. In 1277, Goryeo officials reported that food prices rose due to Hong&#x27;s looting. In 1278, Hong requisitioned rice and beans from western Goryeo. In 1279, a Goryeo envoy reported that the people were distracted by Hong&#x27;s atrocities. During the actual invasion, one of the three commanding Yuan generals, Liu Fuxiang (Yu-Puk Hyong), was shot in the face by retreating samurai and seriously injured. Liu convened with the other generals Holdon and Hong back on his ship. Holdon wanted to keep advancing through the night before more Japanese reinforcements arrived, but Hong was worried that their troops were too exhausted and needed rest. There was also fear of being ambushed in the night. Liu agreed with Hong and recalled the Yuan forces back to their ships. Due to a storm, many of the Yuan ships were beached and destroyed. Of the 30,000 strong invasion force, 13,500 did not return. Hong also led the Eastern Route army along with Kim Pang-gyŏng during the second invasion. They disobeyed orders to wait for the Southern Route army and attacked the Japanese mainland by themselves. They failed.

After Hong&#x27;s failure in Japan, his standing declined. He attacked a popular Goryeo general, Kim Pang-gyŏng, who had fought the Mongols and afterwards sought establishment of friendly ties with the Yuan court. Kim also led Goryeo forces in the Sambyeolcho Rebellion and invasion of Japan, which naturally threatened Hong&#x27;s position. Hong and Kim ran afoul of each other due to Hong&#x27;s harsh tendencies during the preparation for the invasion of Japan. When a scandal connected Kim to an alleged plot to have the king murdered, Hong arrested Kim, tortured him, and requested permission from the Yuan court for another campaign against Goryeo. Chungnyeol of Goryeo and Hong were summoned to Khanbaliq, where a discussion took place and Kublai sided with the king. The Mongol troops were called off, the king returned to Goryeo, and Hong&#x27;s supporters were exiled. After 1281, there are no Goryeo sources about Hong Ta-gu.

==Legacy==
Historical records provide information about two of Hong Ta-gu&#x27;s sons: Hong Chung-hŭi and Hong Chung-gyŏng. The &quot;History of Yuan&quot; says that Chung-hŭi served in the emperor&#x27;s guard in 1276 and in 1279, he inherited his father&#x27;s position as Commander of Goryeo Warriors. He visited Goryeo in 1284 as a Yuan envoy and brought horses to the king as a present. Jung-gyong participated in putting down the rebellion of the Mongol prince Nayan in 1287. In 1306, he was appointed &quot;Pyongjang chongsa&quot; of Liaoyang instead of his uncle, Hong Kun-sang.

Both sons inherited their father&#x27;s hatred of Goryeo. In 1302, the Hong clan proposed combining Liaoyang and the Branch Secretariat for Eastern Campaigns (Goryeo). When Chungseon of Goryeo came to power in 1309, both brothers criticized his administrative reforms and proposed sending warriors from Shenyang to cut lumber in the Paektu Mountain region to provoke conflict. Between 1309 and 1312, the Hong brothers proposed establishing a province in Goryeo instead of having a separate kingdom. Chung-hŭi argued that it was unreasonable for one person to sit on two thrones at the same time, referring to Chungseon&#x27;s position as both king of Goryeo and &quot;Wang&quot; of Shenyang. The &quot;Wang&quot; of Shenyang was created in 1260 to rule Goryeo people living in Shenyang. While real power resided in the Hong clan and other families, the symbolic power of the post occupied by the Goryeo royal family provided an alternative center of power among the Goryeo elite. In 1308, Külüg Khan granted the post to Chungseon. Chungseon also benefited from three rest stop villages established by Kublai in 1279 between Goryeo and Khanbaliq that became his base for expansion into Liaoyang. He was granted lands on the northern bank of the Yalu and gained significant influence over the region. The emperor rejected the proposal to turn Goryeo into a province in 1312. The Hong clan lost most of its power and the brothers are not mentioned again after 1312.

Some of their relatives stayed in Goryeo and obtained relatively high positions there but played no significant role in Goryeo-Yuan relations. Hong Ta-gu&#x27;s younger brother, Hong Kun-sang (? – 1309) was a diplomat between Goryeo-Yuan. Hong Pok-wŏn&#x27;s brother, Hong Baek-su and his family: son Hong Son (? – 1380), grandsons Hong T&#x27;ak, Hong Su, Hong Ik, Hong Myoungleehwasang. They were purged in 1356 by Gongmin of Goryeo.

<text>Joseph Alfred Arner Burnquist (July 21, 1879 – January 12, 1961) was an American attorney and Republican politician in Minnesota. He served in the Minnesota State Legislature from 1909 to 1911, was elected the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota in 1912, and then served as the 19th Governor of Minnesota from December 30, 1915, to January 5, 1921. He became governor after the death of Governor Winfield Scott Hammond (1863–1915).

Elected in 1938, Burnquist returned to serve as Minnesota Attorney General from January 2, 1939, until January 3, 1955, establishing what is now the second-longest record of continuous service in that position.

==Early years==
Joseph Alfred Arner Burnquist was born in Dayton, Iowa, to parents of Swedish descent. He attended Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, and earned his law degree in 1905 from the University of Minnesota Law School.

After a brief time practicing law in Saint Paul, he was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1908, serving from 1909 to 1912.

==Political career==

===Governor of Minnesota===

During his second term as lieutenant governor, Burnquist succeeded Governor Hammond to office on December 30, 1915, who had died unexpectedly.

Social and political tensions increased during the next two years, as Americans became concerned about the war in Europe. At the same time, labor unions were organizing and workers went on strike for better wages and conditions. Turbulent times surrounded the United States&#x27; entrance into the Great War (World War I) in 1917. Having attracted waves of European immigrants in the previous decades, US officials were anxious about the loyalties of these new residents and their native-born citizen descendants. Many classes in foreign languages were dropped from American public schools.

In 1917, ten days after the US entered the war, Burnquist signed legislation to create the Minnesota Commission of Public Safety (MCPS) to monitor public sentiment toward the war. The seven-member commission, ostensibly nonpartisan, opposed groups and actions its members considered suspect, such as immigrants, labor unions, and the Non-Partisan League. Burnquist and the commission were granted near-dictatorial powers, which they used to advance their own business interests by suppressing labor unions. The MCPS also played into anti-German sentiment by targeting ethnic German Minnesotans. Governor Burnquist threatened German-American citizens in New Ulm, Minnesota, with deportation on suspicion of loyalty to Prussia.

The Sedition Act of 1918 curtailed free speech during time of war, and the Immigration Act of 1919 allowed officials to deport any alien or naturalized citizen who advocated the overthrow of the government by force. 

But Burnquist also worked in other areas. He initiated legislation to improve state highways, disaster assistance programs, labor relations, and, especially the welfare of children. He was elected to a full term in November 1918. 

===Attorney General of Minnesota===
After leaving office, Burnquist practiced law for 17 years. During the 1920s, Burnquist wrote several works in the series &quot;Minnesota and its People&quot; at his home in Saint Paul.

In 1939 he was elected as state Attorney General. Repeatedly re-elected, he served 16 years and 1 day, nearly establishing the record for the longest-serving attorney general of Minnesota. (Skip Humphrey served 16 years and 3 days by the end of his tenure in 1999, winning this ranking.)

==President of Saint Paul NAACP Chapter==
Burnquist was president of the Saint Paul chapter of the NAACP from 1914 and ca. 1921. The Duluth lynchings occurred during his tenure in this position and also during his second term as governor; however, his responses to the event were cautious and limited.

==Personal life==

Burnquist was married on January 1, 1906, to Mary Louise Cross (1880–1966). Burnquist died in Minneapolis at the age of 81.

<text>Horace Austin (October 15, 1831November 2, 1905) was an American politician. He served as the sixth Governor of Minnesota from January 9, 1870, to January 7, 1874. He was a Republican.

A reputation for clearheaded objectivity and disdain for contentious party politics enhanced the appeal of Judge Horace Austin as a gubernatorial candidate in 1869. Minnesota&#x27;s sixth governor was determined to bring legislative power to bear against the railroad barons. His advocacy of strictly regulated passenger and freight rates and his opposition to the wholesale allocation of state lands to railroad development earned him a second term. But he was unable to resolve completely the problems inherent in controlling a booming transportation industry and curbing the excesses of its owners.

Born in 1831 in Canterbury, Connecticut, the son of a prosperous Connecticut farmer and graduate of a private academy, Austin taught school briefly before studying law. He was 25 when he moved to Minnesota and began practicing law in St. Peter. Six years later he joined the local Frontier Guards at the outbreak of the Dakota War of 1862. In 1869, while judge of the Sixth Judicial District, Austin impressed state Republican leaders with his fair-mindedness and won the gubernatorial nomination.

Remaining in the public sphere after leaving the governor&#x27;s office, Austin served as third auditor of the U.S. Treasury in Washington, as register of the U.S. Land Office in Fargo, North Dakota, and finally as a railroad commissioner. He devoted his last 16 years to travel and relaxation at his Lake Minnetonka home. He died in 1905 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<text>Lucius Frederick Hubbard (January 26, 1836February 5, 1913) was an American politician. The Republican served as the ninth Governor of Minnesota from January 10, 1882, to January 5, 1887. He also served as an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

== Early life ==
Born in 1836 in Troy, New York, and orphaned at ten, Hubbard first worked as a tinsmith in the east and then in Chicago. At age 21 he moved to Red Wing, Minnesota with an old hand-operated printing press and some type; within two months, he was publisher and editor of the &quot;Red Wing Republican&quot;, in which he promoted his strong political views.

== Career ==
During the American Civil War, Hubbard joined the Union Army in 1861 as a private in the 5th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. He took part in the siege of Corinth, the siege of Vicksburg, the battle of Nashville and the battle of Fort Blakeley. He became colonel of his regiment and, for his services at Nashville, was made a brevet brigadier general on December 16, 1864. After the war&#x27;s end Hubbard returned to Red Wing, where he simultaneously engaged in milling and railroading. He won election to the Minnesota State Senate, completing his second term in 1875. A partner in the Midland Railroad, he also presided over operations of the Cannon Valley Railway until his gubernatorial election in 1881.

Hubbard forcefully urged government intervention in public health, corrections, charities, railroads, agriculture, and commerce, and the legislature complied by increasing the state&#x27;s regulatory and licensing powers. His second term lasted three years, in accordance with a state constitutional amendment to have state, county, and federal biennial elections all coincide.

He was a member of the Military Order of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Sons of the American Revolution.

In 1887 Hubbard took over operations of yet another railroad. When America declared war against Spain in 1898, President William McKinley appointed the 62-year-old as a brigadier general of volunteers and asked him to oversee a military post in Florida. Two years later, Hubbard moved to St. Paul and then to Minneapolis, where he died at 77.

Hubbard County, Minnesota is named after him.

<doc id="251339" wikidata="Q149573" url="?curid=251339" title="Somers Town, London">
<text>Somers Town is an inner-city district in North West London. It has been strongly influenced by the three mainline north London railway termini: Euston (1838), St Pancras (1868) and King&#x27;s Cross (1852), together with the Midland Railway Somers Town Goods Depot (1887) next to St Pancras, where the British Library now stands. It was named after Charles Cocks, 1st Baron Somers (1725–1806). The area was originally granted by William III to John Somers (1651–1716), Lord Chancellor and Baron Somers of Evesham.

Historically, the name &quot;Somers Town&quot; was used for the larger triangular area between the Pancras, Hampstead, and Euston Roads, but it is now taken to mean the rough rectangle centred on Chalton Street and bounded by Pancras Road, Euston Road, Eversholt Street, Crowndale Road, and the railway approaches to St Pancras station. Somers Town was originally within the medieval Parish of St Pancras, Middlesex, which in 1900 became the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras. In 1965 the Borough of St Pancras was abolished and its area became part of the London Borough of Camden.

==History==
===600-1839===

St Pancras Old Church is believed by many to be one of the oldest Christian sites in England. The churchyard remains consecrated but is managed by Camden Council as a park. It holds many literary associations, from Charles Dickens to Thomas Hardy, as well as memorials to dignitaries, including the remarkable tomb of architect Sir John Soane.

In the mid 1750s the New Road was established to bypass the congestion of London; Somers Town lay immediately north of this east–west toll road. In 1784, the first housing was built at the Polygon amid fields, brick works and market gardens on the northern fringes of London. Mary Wollstonecraft, writer, philosopher and feminist, lived there with her husband William Godwin, and died there in 1797 after giving birth to the future Mary Shelley, author of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The area appears to have appealed to middle-class people fleeing the French Revolution. The site of the Polygon is now occupied by a block of council flats called Oakshott Court, which features a commemorative plaque for Wollstonecraft.

St Mary&#x27;s Church opened near the Polygon in 1827 and is now the parish church. In 1830 the first on-duty fatality for the newly founded Metropolitan Police occurred when PC Joseph Grantham was kicked to death while trying to break up a street fight in Smiths Place, Somers Town. The Polygon deteriorated socially as the surrounding land was subsequently sold off in smaller lots for cheaper housing, especially after the start of construction in the 1830s of the railway lines into Euston, St Pancras and King&#x27;s Cross. In this period the area housed a large transient population of labourers and the population density of the area soared.

===1840-1899===
When St Luke&#x27;s Church, near King&#x27;s Cross, was demolished to make way for the construction of the Midland Railway&#x27;s St Pancras station and its Midland Grand Hotel, the estimated 12,000 inhabitants of Somers Town at that time were deprived of that place of worship, as the church building was re-erected in Kentish Town, though St Mary&#x27;s remained and St Matthew&#x27;s Oakley Square was added in 1856. In 1868 the lace merchant and philanthropist George Moore funded a new church, known as Christ Church and an associated school in Chalton Street with an entrance in Ossulston Street. The school accommodated about 600 children. Christ Church and the adjacent school were destroyed in a World War II bombing raid and no trace remains today, the site being occupied by a children&#x27;s play area and sports court, with its parish transferred to Old Saint Pancras Church. By the late 19th century most of the houses in the Polygon were in multiple occupation, and overcrowding was severe with whole families sometimes living in one room, as confirmed by the social surveys of Charles Booth and Irene Barclay.

Charles Dickens lived in the Polygon briefly as a child and knew the area well. The Polygon, where he once lived, appears in Chapter 52 of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1836), when Mr Pickwick&#x27;s solicitor&#x27;s clerk, arriving at Gray&#x27;s Inn just before ten o&#x27;clock, says he heard the clocks strike half past nine as he walked through Somers Town: &quot;It went the half hour as I came through The Polygon.&quot; The building makes its appearance again in &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1852), when it served as the home of Harold Skimpole. In &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), Johnson (now Cranleigh) Street was the thoroughfare near the Royal Veterinary College, Camden Town, where the Micawbers lived, when Traddles, David Copperfield&#x27;s friend and schoolfellow, was their lodger.

In &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1859) Roger Cly, the Old Bailey informant, was buried in Old St Pancras Churchyard. The funeral over, later that night Jerry Cruncher and his companions went &quot;fishing&quot; (body snatching), trying unsuccessfully to &#x27;resurrect&#x27; Cly. Robert Blincoe (1792–1860), on whose life story &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838) may be based, was a child inmate at the St Pancras Workhouse. A central character in Dickens’ Our Mutual Friend (1865) is Nicodemus Boffin, nicknamed &#x27;The Golden Dustman&#x27; because of the wealth he inherited from his old employer John Harmon, who had made his fortune as a dust contractor at Somers Town.

An infirmary was added to the St Pancras Workhouse, adjacent to St Pancras Old Church in 1848, later becoming the St Pancras Hospital, the only hospital in the area not to have closed since 1980. Its current site includes buildings previously used by the Workhouse. St Mary&#x27;s Dispensary (later the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital) opened at 144 Euston Road in 1866, followed by the National Temperance Hospital at 110-112 Hampstead Road in 1873.

===1900-1979===
Improvement of the slum housing conditions, amongst the worst in the capital, was first undertaken by St Pancras Borough Council in 1906 at Goldington Buildings, at the junction of Pancras Road and Royal College Street, and continued on a larger scale by the St Pancras House Improvement Society (subsequently the St Pancras &amp; Humanist Housing Association, the present owner of Goldington Buildings) which was established in 1924. Its founders were Church of England priest Father Basil Jellicoe and Irene Barclay, the first woman in Britain to qualify as a chartered surveyor. The Society&#x27;s Sidney Street and Drummond Street estates incorporated sculpture panels of Doultonware designed by Gilbert Bayes and ornamental finials for the washing line posts designed by the same artist: these are now mostly destroyed or replaced with replicas.

The Hospital for Tropical Diseases moved onto the St Pancras Hospital site in 1948. Further social housing was built by the London County Council, which began construction of the Ossulston Estate in 1927. There remains a small number of older Grade 2 listed properties, mostly Georgian terraced houses. During the early 1970s the neighborhood comprising Greater London Council-owned housing in Charrington, Penryn, Platt and Medburn Streets was a centre for the squatting movement.

===1979-present===
In the 1980s, some council tenants took advantage of the &#x27;right to buy&#x27; scheme and bought their homes at a substantial discount. Later they moved away from the area. The consequence was an influx of young semi-professional people, resulting in a changing population. Somers Town experienced ethnic tension between whites and Bengalis in the early 1990s, climaxing in the murder of Richard Everitt in 1994. Major construction work along the eastern side of Somers Town was completed in 2008, to allow for the Eurostar trains to arrive at the refurbished St Pancras station. This involved the excavation of part of the St Pancras Old Churchyard, the human remains being re-interred at St Pancras and Islington Cemetery in East Finchley.

Land at Brill Place, previously earmarked for later phases of the British Library development, became available when the library expansion was cancelled and was used as site offices for the High Speed 1 terminal development and partly to allow for excavation of a tunnel for the new Thameslink station. It was then acquired as the site for the Francis Crick Institute (formerly the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation), a major medical research institute established by a partnership of Cancer Research UK, Imperial College London, King&#x27;s College London, the Medical Research Council, University College London (UCL) and the Wellcome Trust.

A number of significant films have been set in Somers Town: the 1955 Ealing comedy &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; with Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers; Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; of 1986, featuring Bob Hoskins; Mike Leigh&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;High Hopes&quot;; Anthony Minghella&#x27;s 2006 romantic drama &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot; starring Jude Law and Juliette Binoche; and in 2008 Shane Meadows&#x27;s &quot;Somers Town&quot;, which was filmed almost entirely in and around Phoenix Court, a low-rise council property in Purchese Street. The area is mentioned in the Pogues song &#x27;Transmetropolitan&#x27;, the first song written by the band, who used to live nearby in St Pancras.

==Arts and culture==
Somers Town has a flourishing street market, held in Chalton Street, Wednesday to Friday. The START (Somers Town Art) Festival of Cultures is held on the second Saturday in July, on the site of the market. It is the biggest street festival in the Camden borough and attracts about 10,000 people, bringing together the area&#x27;s diverse cultural communities.

==Infrastructure==
===Hospitals===
All the area&#x27;s hospitals have closed since 1980, apart from St Pancras Hospital, whose large red brick building fronting the complex to the north of St Pancras Gardens is still residential, chiefly as a rehabilitation hospital for the elderly. Other buildings house the headquarters of Camden NHS Primary Care Trust. It also accommodates parts of Islington Primary Care Trust, the Huntley Centre (a mental health unit) and St Pancras Coroner&#x27;s Court.

===Education===
There are two secondary schools in the area, the Roman Catholic co-educational Maria Fidelis Convent School FCJ in Phoenix Road, and the state Regent High School in Charrington Street. Regent High School was established in 1877 and has gone through several name changes, more recently as Sir William Collins Secondary School, then as South Camden Community School. Somers Town Community Sports Centre was built on part of the school playground. The building is leased to a charitable trust that is jointly managed by the school and UCL (UCL is based a few hundred metres to the south of Euston Road and is a major employer of local residents). It is used for 17% of available hours by UCLU&#x27;s sports teams for training and home matches and for recreational sport by UCL students. As part of Building Schools for the Future plans to expand the school, it is probable that the sports centre will be reintegrated back into the school campus.

There are also three primary schools: Edith Neville (state), St Aloysius (state-aided Catholic) and St Mary and St Pancras (state-aided Church of England). The latter has been built beneath Somerset Court, four floors of university student accommodation units. The children&#x27;s charity Scene &amp; Heard is also based in Somers Town. It offers a unique mentoring project that partners the inner-city children of Somers Town with volunteer theatre professionals, providing each child who participates with quality one-on-one adult attention and an experience of personal success through the process of writing and performing plays.

===Transport===
The nearest London Underground stations are Mornington Crescent, Euston and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras. National Rail services operate from the nearby London King&#x27;s Cross, London St Pancras and London Euston stations. St Pancras International is the terminus for Eurostar services and was the London terminus for the Javelin fast train service to London Olympic Park.

<text>John Sargent Pillsbury (July 29, 1827 – October 18, 1901) was an American politician, businessman, and philanthropist. A Republican, he served as the eighth Governor of Minnesota from 1876 to 1882. He was a co-founder of the Pillsbury Company.

==Early life==
Pillsbury was born in Sutton, New Hampshire, the son of John and Susan (Wadleigh) Pillsbury. He was a descendant of William Pillsbury, who emigrated from England to Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1640. In 1851, he opened a store in Warner, New Hampshire, partnering with Walter Harriman, a future Governor of New Hampshire and Civil War general.

==Career==

===Pillsbury Company===
Pillsbury underwent a tour of the West in 1855, and decided to make St. Anthony, Minnesota, now part of Minneapolis his home. Shortly after settling in Minnesota, he would marry Mahala Fisk. Pillsbury began a diverse entrepreneurial career including ventures in hardware, real estate and lumber before he would found his most successful business, C. A. Pillsbury and Company, along with his nephew Charles Alfred Pillsbury, for whom the company was named.

===Political career===
After the American Civil War, Pillsbury was elected as a third class companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Pillsbury served in the Minnesota Senate for several years before becoming the eighth Governor of Minnesota. He served as governor from January 7, 1876, until January 10, 1882. During the Grasshopper Plague of 1877, Governor Pillsbury called for a day of prayer on April 26, 1877. A subsequent sleet storm killed all the grasshoppers. In Cold Spring, Minnesota, a chapel was built to honor the miracle.

===Philanthropist===
Pillsbury was a noted philanthropist and often anonymously donated funds to causes he favored. In particular, he helped the University of Minnesota recover from debt in its early years, and later served as a regent. Since then, he has become known as &quot;The Father of the University.&quot; Pillsbury Hall at the University of Minnesota is named in his honor.

==Personal life==
Pillsbury married Mahala Fisk on November 3, 1856. He and Mahala had four children, daughters Addie, Susan May, and Sarah Belle, and then son Alfred. Addie married Charles M. Webster, but died at the age of 25; Susan married Frederic Beal Snyder and died at the age of 28; Sarah Belle married Edward C. Gale, an area lawyer and son of the area&#x27;s first real estate developer, Samuel Chester Gale. Edward Gale was also an art collector and contributed to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) as well. Alfred did not go into business, but instead became an art collector. When he died in 1950, the works were donated to MIA.

His daughter&#x27;s Susan&#x27;s only son, John Pillsbury Snyder (1888 –1959), was a survivor of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912. John and his wife, Nelle, returning from their European honeymoon, are said to have been the first people to have entered the very first lifeboat, No. 7.

Pillsbury died on October 18, 1901, and is interred in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 44) along New Hampshire Route 114 in Sutton.

<text>Andrew Ryan McGill (February 19, 1840 – October 31, 1905) was an American politician of the United States Republican Party. He served as the tenth Governor of Minnesota from January 5, 1887, to January 9, 1889.

==Family==

Andrew Ryan McGill, the son of Angeline (née Martin) and Charles McGill, was born in Saegertown, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 1840. Andrew&#x27;s father, Charles Dillon McGill (1802–1875), was the youngest son of Patrick (1762–1832) and Anna (née Baird) McGill. Patrick had emigrated from County Antrim, Ireland, about 1774, settling in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. In 1795 Patrick and Anna moved their family to the western part of Pennsylvania, homesteading several hundred acres in Crawford County. Andrew&#x27;s mother, Angeline Martin (1811–1849), was the eldest of Armand (1785–1861) and Mary (née Ryan, 1789–1866) Martin&#x27;s nine children. The Martin family also owned land in western Pennsylvania. Armand&#x27;s brother, Lieutenant General Charles Martin, who commanded troops stationed at Fort de Boueff (Watertown, Pennsylvania) in the late 1790s, settled in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

McGill married Eliza E. Bryant (d. 1877), daughter of Charles S. Bryant, a lawyer and author from St. Peter, Minnesota. Together they had three children: Charles Herbert (b. 1866), Robert C. (b. 1869), and Lida B. (b. 1874). In 1879, two years after Eliza&#x27;s death, Andrew married Mary E. Wilson, daughter of Margaret Maleena (née Stone) and Joseph Carlton Wilson, a prominent physician of Edinboro, Pennsylvania. Mary and Andrew had two children: Wilson (b. 1884) and Thomas (b. 1889).

==Early career==
In 1859, at the age of nineteen, Andrew Ryan McGill moved from Pennsylvania to Kentucky to become a schoolteacher. When the Civil War began and teaching, work was no longer feasible in Kentucky, McGill left for Minnesota, arriving June 10, 1861. He became principal of the public school in St. Peter, Minnesota, in August 1862. In that same year, at the age of 22, McGill enlisted in Company D, 9th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. In 1863 he was discharged for disability. Soon after his discharge he was elected county superintendent of public schools (Nicollet County, Minnesota), a position he filled for two terms. From 1865 through 1866 McGill was the editor and proprietor of the St. Peter Tribune. In 1865 he was also elected clerk of the district court of Nicollet County for a term of four years. McGill took the opportunity to study law under Judge Horace Austin and was admitted to the bar in 1869.

==Political career==
In 1870 Austin was elected governor of Minnesota and McGill was selected as his private secretary. In 1873, McGill was appointed insurance commissioner of the state, a position he held for thirteen years. In 1886, the Republican state convention nominated McGill as their candidate for governor of Minnesota. He won the nomination and the election, serving a single, two-year term as governor (1887–1889). During his term he recommended a revision of the railroad laws pertaining to transportation, storage, and grading of wheat, the watering of railroad stocks, a simplification of the tax laws, regulation of liquor, abolition of contract prison labor, establishment of a soldiers&#x27; home, and creation of a Bureau of Labor Statistics. While not re-elected, McGill remained active in politics, supporting the presidential candidacy of Cushman K. Davis (1896) and serving in the Minnesota State Senate from the 37th District, St. Paul (1899–1905). McGill was appointed postmaster of St. Paul (1900) while concurrently serving as senator.

He died at his home in St. Paul on October 31, 1905.

He served in the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1883 and 1887 and was the Speaker of the House in 1887. He served as the 11th Governor of Minnesota from January 9, 1889 to January 4, 1893. He was a Republican.

By 1888 a split in the state Republican Party was reflected in an unorthodox selection of a gubernatorial candidate. Instead of supporting the reform-minded incumbent, Andrew Ryan McGill, a majority of party stalwarts rallied behind William Merriam, an ambitious St. Paul banker and speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives.

Merriam&#x27;s re-election campaign two years later was affected by another, more widespread phenomenon, the Farmers&#x27; Alliance. This third party of disaffected Republicans and Democrats was dedicated to promoting the commercial and social interests of agrarian America. Merriam defeated the Alliance candidate in 1890, but the upstart party significantly eroded his plurality.
As governor, Merriam was a thrifty executive who was more interested in limiting spending than in legislative reform. The most notable legacy of his administration was the adoption of the Australian ballot, which allowed citizens to vote in comparative privacy. In his private life, the sociable Merriam was keen on sports, owned horses, and was said to possess &quot;good nature, gracious manners, and an attractive personality.&quot;

Merriam&#x27;s final accomplishment was appropriate for a banker and businessman who could work well with both people and numbers. He was director of the twelfth national census and later persuaded Congress to establish a permanent Census Bureau, where he served as its first director. Merriam never returned to Minnesota, but retired instead to Florida, where he died in Port Sewall at age 81.

==Remains==
His three-quarter portrait by the Swiss born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) was painted in 1892. This and a portrait of his wife were exhibited in St. Paul in that year. A small, bust-length portrait, is now in the collection of the Newport Preservation Society, Rhode Island; it was formerly in the collections of Jessica Dragonette and the University of Wyoming. Müller-Ury is also known to have painted a portrait of their son Amherst Merriam as a baby.

Merriam is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, DC.

<text>David Marston Clough (December 27, 1846 – August 28, 1924) was an American lumberman and politician. He served in the Minnesota State Senate from January 1887 to January 1893. He served as the state&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, January 9, 1893 to January 31, 1895. He was the 13th Governor of Minnesota from January 31, 1895 to January 2, 1899. He was a Republican.

==Life and career==
Clough was born in 1846 in Lyme, New Hampshire, the fourth of fourteen children of Sarah C. (Brown) and Elbridge G. Clough, New England farmers who resettled near the Rum River. Clough helped his family eke out a scanty living from the land by raising crops and cutting timber. His boyhood experiences would serve him well as both an entrepreneur and public servant in a state where agriculture and lumber dominated the economy.

Clough&#x27;s first business venture, a logging operation he founded at 20, lifted him from poverty and launched him on a path toward wealth and political prominence. He moved to Minneapolis in 1872 and was elected to the city council eleven years later and then to the Minnesota Senate. From the Senate, he advanced to the office of lieutenant governor under Republican Knute Nelson, whose election to the U.S. Senate moved Clough into the governor&#x27;s office.

Clough&#x27;s first administration was notable for the ratification of significant amendments to the state constitution, including those establishing the Minnesota Board of Pardons, withdrawing the right of aliens to vote, and authorizing municipalities to frame &quot;home rule&quot; charters. During his second term, narrowly won in 1896, the legislature raised taxes on several private industries and enacted child-labor laws.

In 1900 the redoubtable railroad magnate James J. Hill urged Clough to establish a lumber operation near Puget Sound. Until his death on August 28, 1924, at age 77, the logger-turned-lumber baron lived in Everett, Washington, where he championed the interests of the mill owners against their employees&#x27; unionization efforts. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Everett.

Clough is the namesake of Culdrum Township, Morrison County, Minnesota.

<text>The Hotel New Hampshire is a 1981 coming of age novel by American-Canadian writer John Irving, his fifth published novel.

==Plot==
This novel is the story of the Berrys, a quirky New Hampshire family composed of a married couple, Win and Mary, and their five children, Frank, Franny, John, Lilly, and Egg. The parents, both from the small town of Dairy, New Hampshire (presumably based on Derry, New Hampshire), fall in love while working at a summer resort hotel in Maine as teenagers. There, they meet a Viennese Jew named Freud who works at the resort as a handyman and entertainer, performing with his pet bear, State o&#x27; Maine; Freud comes to symbolize the magic of that summer for them. By summer&#x27;s end, the teens are engaged, and Win buys Freud&#x27;s bear and motorcycle and travels the country performing to raise money to go to Harvard, which he subsequently attends while Mary starts their family. He then returns to Dairy and teaches at the local second-rate boys&#x27; prep school he attended, the Dairy School. But he is unsatisfied and dreaming of something better.

Brash, self-confident beauty Franny is the object of John&#x27;s adoration. John serves as the narrator, and is sweet, if naive. Frank is physically and socially awkward, reserved, and homosexual; he shares a friendship with his younger sister, Lilly, a romantic young girl who has stopped physically growing. Egg is an immature little boy with a penchant for dressing up in costumes. John and Franny are companions, seeing themselves as the most normal of the children, aware their family is rather strange. But, as John remarks, to themselves the family&#x27;s oddness seems &quot;right as rain.&quot;

Win conceives the idea of turning an abandoned girls&#x27; school into a hotel. He names it the Hotel New Hampshire and the family moves in. This becomes the first part of the Dickensian-style tale. Key plot points include Franny&#x27;s rape at the hands of quarterback Chipper Dove and several of his fellow football teammates. The actions and attitude of Chipper, with whom Franny is in love, are contrasted with those of her rescuer, Junior Jones, a black member of the team. The death of the family dog, Sorrow, provides dark comedy as he is repeatedly &quot;resurrected&quot; via taxidermy, first scaring Win&#x27;s father, Iowa Bob, to death and then foiling a sexual initiation of John&#x27;s. John partakes in a continuing sexual/business relationship with the older hotel housekeeper, Ronda Ray, which ends when a letter arrives from Freud in Vienna, inviting the family to move to help him (and his new &quot;smart&quot; bear) run his hotel there.

Traveling separately from the rest of the family, Mary and Egg are killed in a plane crash. The others take up life in Vienna at what is renamed the (second) Hotel New Hampshire, one floor of which is occupied by prostitutes and another floor by a group of radical communists. The family discover Freud is now blind and the &quot;smart bear&quot; is actually a young woman named Susie, who has endured events which leave her with little fondness for humans and feeling most secure inside a very realistic bear suit. After the death of his wife, Win Berry retreats further into his own hazy, vague fantasy world, while the family navigate relationships with the prostitutes and the radicals. John and Franny experience the pain and desire of being in love with each other. The two also feel jealousy when John becomes romantically involved with a communist who commits suicide, and Franny finds comfort, freedom, and excitement in sexual relationships with both Susie the Bear and Ernst, the &quot;quarterback&quot; of the radicals. Lilly develops as a writer and authors a novel based on the family, under whose noses an elaborate plot is being hatched by the radicals to blow up the Vienna opera house, using Freud and the family as hostages, which Freud and Win barely manage to stop. In the process, Freud dies and Win himself is blinded. The family become famous as heroes, and with Frank as Lilly&#x27;s agent, her book is published for a large amount of money. The family (with Susie) returns to the States, taking up residence in The Stanhope hotel in New York.

In the final part of the novel, Franny and John find a way to resolve their love, and Franny, with Susie&#x27;s ingenious assistance, finally gets revenge on Chipper. Franny also finds success as a movie actress and marries Junior, now a well-known civil rights lawyer. Lilly is unable to cope with the pressure of her career and her own self-criticism and commits suicide. John and Frank purchase the shut-down resort in Maine where their parents met during the &quot;magical&quot; summer, and the property becomes another hotel of sorts, functioning as a rape crisis center run by Susie and with Win providing unwitting counsel to victims. Susie, whose emotional pain and insecurities have healed somewhat with time and effort, builds a happy relationship with John, and a pregnant Franny asks them to raise her and Junior&#x27;s impending baby.

== Characters ==

John Berry: John is the third child of Win and Mary Berry. He has four siblings: Frank, Franny, Lilly, and Egg. The story is told from a first-person point of view, John being the narrator. He is particularly close to Franny, more so than any of his other siblings, and eventually falls in love with her. After Franny is raped, John takes a particular interest in becoming physically fitter to fulfill his desired role as Franny&#x27;s protector, attempting to impress Franny and assuage the guilt he felt for not stopping the attack. With help from his grandfather, Iowa Bob (or Coach Bob), he begins working out, until he is able to describe himself such: &quot;That’s me: five feet eight inches tall, and 150 pounds. And hard all over.&quot; (111). Although John has a few short sexual endeavors with various women, he always holds a special place in his heart for Franny. Eventually, the two succumb to their mutual love and have sex for almost an entire day. After this, they remain close, but only as brother and sister. John helps start a rape recovery and support clinic at the old Arbuthnot-by-the-Sea, where his parents first met. He also marries Susie the Bear, and the couple adopt Franny&#x27;s child.

Franny Berry: Second-oldest child of the Berry family, she is considered strikingly attractive. She has a tendency to take charge of the family, particularly after her mother dies. She is caring, vibrant, and outgoing, although her confidence sometimes tends toward offensive or reckless behavior; however, her intentions are always to protect those she loves. She also eventually falls in love with her brother, John. During her teenage years, she becomes the victim of a gang rape, revealing previously hidden sensitivity and self-doubt, and the experience remains with her throughout her life. She becomes an actress and stars in a movie about her own family. After she and John resolve their love for each other, she marries one of the classmates who rescued her from the rape, Junior Jones. Much later, the two have a child, which they give to John and Susie.

Frank Berry: Oldest of the Berry children, he is often at odds with John and Franny. Around the age of 16 he comes out as homosexual, which results in a fair amount of abuse from his schoolmates, especially football players. This culminates when he&#x27;s hazed by the football players and rescued by John and Franny. His association with his siblings improves after that as the children became more of a united unit facing bigger, external problems. The most serious of all his siblings, Frank goes on to major in economics, showing a talent for business, and eventually becomes Lilly&#x27;s agent. Later, he also becomes Franny&#x27;s agent and John&#x27;s business partner. He is the most reserved sibling, keeping his personal life to himself while still being a generous part of the family. In his youth, Frank had a passion for taxidermy, but gave it up after the deaths of his mother and Egg. His penchant for costumes and formal pageantry remained with him for a somewhat longer period.

Lilly Berry: The second-youngest Berry child. She is small in size, probably because she is a dwarf. She is quiet and likable, and of the siblings, she is closest to Frank, possibly because compared to the others they are more reserved. Lilly often shows borderline disgust when matters of sex or bodily functions are discussed (usually by Franny), and is even portrayed as somewhat prudish about simple physical needs such as eating. She becomes a literary figure after her first book, essentially an autobiography of her family, is released. She continues to write, with Frank acting as her agent. Eventually, she succumbs to writer&#x27;s block and commits suicide. She leaves a note which reads, &quot;Sorry, just not big enough.&quot;

Egg Berry: The youngest of the Berry children. He is also the most comical of them all, though it is unintentional. An ear infection left him somewhat deaf, and his response to most statements/questions directed towards him is &quot;What?&quot; Egg&#x27;s character is never fully formed, and he remains forever an amorphous &quot;egg&quot; of a child who never matures or develops due to dying at a very young age.

Win Berry: The father of the Berry children and husband of Mary Berry. He is a graduate of Harvard, but rarely applies such skills. He is more or less an entrepreneur in the field of lodging, although his success is at best unconventional. He becomes depressed when his wife, Mary, along with his youngest son, Egg, are killed in a plane crash. This state of depression slowly spirals downward, reaching a low point when he is blinded by an explosion during the foiling of the radicals&#x27; terrorist plot. He eventually affects a similar demeanor to Freud, his old friend, and begins to gain confidence again when he and his family move back to the States. He becomes an unknowing counselor at John and Frank&#x27;s clinic.

Mary Berry: The mother of the Berry children and wife of Win Berry. She grew up in a very scholarly family, and is a subtle and gentle mother and devoted wife. Unfortunately, en route to Vienna, her plane crashes, killing both her and her youngest child, Egg. The Berry family decide Mary would have liked Vienna.

Freud: An old Austrian Jew, he initially trained a bear, State o&#x27; Maine, and performed at the Arbuthnot-by-the-Sea. He returned to Europe in 1939 and was imprisoned by the Nazis. He was blinded in an experiment in the concentration camps. He survived, and afterward started a hotel in Vienna. He invites Win Berry to come be his partner, which Win accepts. Their business is not entirely successful, but Freud dies a hero when he stops a terrorist plot by sacrificing his life. Win was very fond of him and seems to be a protégé of Freud.

Iowa Bob: Grandfather of the Berry children and father to Win Berry. He earned a reputation as a stalwart supporter of physical activity, and eventually accepted a position as head of the PE division at a private school in Dairy, New Hampshire, so long as his son, Win Berry, was allowed to attend the school for free. Iowa Bob later supports John when he decides to begin physical training. Iowa Bob&#x27;s quest for cardiovascular perfection did not prevent him from dying &quot;of fright&quot; when he discovered the taxidermy version of Sorrow, the family dog, in his closet. He is best remembered by his quotes &quot;We’re screwed down for life&quot; (page 117) and &quot;You’ve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed.&quot; (page 111). These quotes are often referenced to the living style of the Berry family.

Ronda Ray: More or less a housekeeper at the first Hotel New Hampshire. She has a &quot;day room&quot; at the hotel, and introduces John to the sexual world; though it is not love, it is nevertheless a relation of attraction. Ronda Ray also dabbles in prostitution, although she seems unaware of the unconventionality of her arrangements.

Junior Jones: African-American football player at the private school in Dairy, New Hampshire. He is quiet, and unlike most of his fellow players. He helps rescue Franny from being raped, and is a source of comfort for Franny afterward. After many years, the two marry and give their child to John and Susie.

Chipper Dove: Football player who raped Franny and was Franny&#x27;s first love. Out of love-sickness, Franny remained in contact with him even after the rape. After the family moved back to the States, they encountered Chipper again, but they staged an elaborate hoax, which resulted in Chipper disappearing from their lives.

Ernst: German radical at the second Hotel New Hampshire. He is involved in a terrorist plot, but is killed by Win before it can be carried out. He resembles Chipper Dove in appearance and deportment.

Bitty Tuck: Rich, classy girl whom John was involved with during the New Year&#x27;s party. Their fun is cut short when Bitty, while putting on a diaphragm in the bathroom, sees the taxidermy version of Sorrow and faints. Her nickname, &quot;Titsie,&quot; refers to her large breasts.

Lenny Metz and Chester Pulaski: Football players who also raped Franny. They were &quot;taken care of&quot; by the &quot;Black Arm of the Law.&quot;

Susie (the Bear): A young woman who meets the Berry family in Vienna, where she is assisting Freud with the hotel. Sometime before working for Freud, Susie was raped by an attacker who stuffed a paper bag over Susie&#x27;s head, telling her she was too ugly to look at. The anger and indignity Susie feels after this attack cause her to adopt the costume and persona of a bear as a form of self-preservation and retreat. Freud finds Susie&#x27;s ursine alter ego to be helpful in containing trouble from the colorful factions in his hotel. When Susie meets Franny, the two bond over their similar experiences and find refuge in a temporary sexual relationship. Gradually, Susie reclaims her humanity and self-confidence, and has a romantic relationship with John, but keeps the bear costume. She still suffers from a fear of producing &quot;ugly&quot; offspring, but becomes open to the idea of raising a (human) child when Franny asks her and John to adopt the baby she and Junior conceive.

== &quot;Keep passing the open windows&quot; ==

This phrase recurs throughout the novel as a catchphrase among the Berry family. It is drawn from a story that the Berry parents tell their children, about a street performer called &quot;The King of Mice.&quot; Saying &quot;keep passing the open windows&quot; is the family&#x27;s way of telling each other to persevere.

==Reception==
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Leonard made gentle fun of the amount of promotion that Irving, a literary celebrity after the success of &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, had done for the book, and of some of his claims in these interviews (such as that &quot;Hotel New Hampshire&quot; was a fable a child could understand), but liked the book overall: &quot;Mr. Irving is extremely funny, at least in his novels... Whether it unravels more than it unfolds doesn&#x27;t matter in the masterly telling; it enchants... And the set pieces, such as Frannie&#x27;s revenge on Chipper Dove are wonderful.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
The novel was made into a film in 1984, directed by Tony Richardson and starring Jodie Foster, Rob Lowe, and Beau Bridges.

<text>Johannes &quot;John&quot; Lind (March 25, 1854 – September 18, 1930) was an American politician from Minnesota. He served as the 14th Governor of Minnesota from 1899 to 1901 and represented the state in the United States Congress for four terms. Lind also played an important role in the Mexican Revolution as an envoy for President Woodrow Wilson.

==Early life and career==
Lind was born on March 25, 1854, in Kånna, Kronoberg County in the Swedish province of Småland. He was born to the farmer Peter Gustaf Jonasson and his wife Katrina Jonasdotter. When he was thirteen years old (in 1868), he emigrated to the United States with his parents. He worked as a teacher and superintendent before graduating from the University of Minnesota Law School.

Lind settled in New Ulm to practice law. Most of the inhabitants were German, but Lind adjusted by learning to speak German almost as fluently as he could Swedish. He was soon known among the lawyers across the ninth circuit.

He joined the Republican party almost as soon as he set up his office; most Swedes made the same choice in Minnesota. While he could not yet vote in the 1872 presidential election, he stood at the polls to hand out ballots. Party loyalty brought the usual rewards: a receivership in the United States Land Office in 1881, and 1886 a Republican nomination to Congress. Lind was so devoted to his law practice that in the very convention that first nominated him to Congress, he left before proceedings had closed to attend to a client in the court down at Lincoln County.

== United States Representative ==
Lind was no great orator, but he had special advantages. His district was Republican, generally by a two-to-one margin. The Swedish vote was dependably in favor of Lind, as well, and so were the Germans in New Ulm, thanks to his wide professional acquaintanceship with them. Farmers also resented the duty on binding-twine in the protective tariff, and ran as a moderate tariff revisionist. His support for placing lumber on the duty-free list was far more popular within his district than in the lumber-producing regions in the north of the state. Concerned over the destruction of the nation&#x27;s forests and a strong supporter for the national timber-culture law, he hoped that a larger importation of foreign lumber would slacken the timber companies&#x27; appetite for American trees.

Lind served as a Republican in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1887, to March 3, 1893, in the 50th, 51st, and 52nd congresses. As a member of the House Commerce Committee, he handled all the bills dealing with bridge construction in the Northwest and stood fast against monopoly privileges. Any railroad company authorized to span a river would have to guarantee free use by every other railroad, in return for reasonable compensation. Lind offered an anti-trust bill of his own, forbidding railroads from carrying any of the so-called patent cars—those like the oil-cars that Standard Oil built, or the refrigerator cars that the meat-packers designed—that could not be furnished to all shippers at equal and fair rates. Even when he supported the McKinley protective tariff, the highest in history, he made himself conspicuous trying to cut the rates on jute-bagging for small shippers and in his fight against a seven hundred percent hike in the protection given to binding-twine manufacturers. In 1890, when the Farmers&#x27; Alliances were defeating other Minnesota Republican congressmen, Lind survived re-election challenges.

Lind chose not to continue in the House. His law practice had been neglected, and, with no independent means, he found it better to announce his retirement at the end of the Fifty-Second Congress.

== Governor of Minnesota ==
Lind served in the Spanish–American War in 1898.

Lind also served in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1903, to March 3, 1905, as a Democrat. When he was elected Governor of Minnesota, he was the first non-Republican to hold that office in forty years.

Lind did not withdraw from politics entirely, and was considered for the Republican nomination for governor in 1892, but was conspicuously uninterested. Four years later, however, he ran for governor as a Democrat. He lost but Minnesota remained a firmly Republican state.

In 1898, Lind ran again and was elected with the endorsement of the Populists and Silver Republicans. He served as the 14th Governor of Minnesota from January 2, 1899, to January 7, 1901.

==Mexican Revolution==

On March 4, 1913, Woodrow Wilson was sworn in as President of the United States shortly after the February 22 assassination of Mexican President Francisco I. Madero and Vice President José María Pino Suárez. It soon became clear that U.S. Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson was complicit in the plot.

General Victoriano Huerta was now president of Mexico, and Wilson and Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan immediately sent Lind to Mexico as Envoy for Mexican Affairs. Lind had financial interests in Mexico and had long-standing ties with other U.S. landholders.

Lind attempted to persuade Huerta to call prompt elections and not stand as a candidate in them, but Huerta refused. Lind &quot;threatened a military intervention by the United States in case the demands were rejected,&quot; but promised an American loan to Mexico if Huerta stepped aside. When rebellions broke against the Huerta regime, Lind backed Venustiano Carranza, a large landowner and former Governor of Coahuila, and his Constitutionalist faction against more radical elements in the rebellion, mainly Constitutionalist Army general Pancho Villa.

==Personal life==

In 1879 he married Alice A. Shepard.

Lind was known for having a temper. According to an article on the front page of the Moose Lake (Minnesota) &quot;Star&quot; on January 17, 1901: &quot;Ex-governor John Lind after having freed himself from the duties of the governor last Thursday walked down to the Dispatch office in St. Paul and administered to Editor Black a well-deserved licking. For a one-armed man, John Lind can make some telling blows once in a while.&quot;

== Death ==
He died on September 18, 1930 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<text>Peter John Olivi, also Pierre de Jean Olivi or Petrus Joannis Olivi (1248 – 14 March 1298), was a French Franciscan theologian and philosopher who, although he died professing the faith of the Roman Catholic Church, remained a controversial figure in the arguments surrounding poverty at the beginning of the 14th century. In large part, this was due to his view that the Franciscan vow of poverty also entailed &quot;usus pauper&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &#x27;poor&#x27; or &#x27;restricted&#x27; use of goods). While contemporary Franciscans generally agreed that &quot;usus pauper&quot; was important to the Franciscan way of life, they disagreed that it was part of their vow of poverty. His support of the rigorous view of ecclesiastical poverty played a part in the ideology of the groups coming to be known as the Spiritual Franciscans or Fraticelli.

==Biography==
Born at Sérignan, Diocese of Béziers, 1247/48, at twelve he entered the Friars Minor at Béziers, studied at Montpellier, and later attended the University at Paris. He was present there in 1268, when Bonaventure gave his &quot;Collationes de septem donis Spiritus sancti&quot;, and was probably still there in 1273 for Bonaventure&#x27;s &quot;Collationes in Hexaemeron&quot;. Returning to his native province, he taught in different places, and was probably in Narbonne around 1277–79.
During the preparation of Nicholas III&#x27;s Bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot;, in the summer of 1279, Olivi accompanied his provincial minister to Italy, but was not himself part of the commission that worked on the Bull. He was asked to express briefly his opinion with regard to Franciscan poverty, but composed much longer questions on the evangelical perfection. Upon his return to Languedoc, he was accepted as lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Montpellier, but later turned to Scripture Studies. He produced a number of biblical commentaries: &quot;Genesis, Isaiah, Job, Matthew, John, Romans&quot;, and &quot;Revelation&quot;, among others. One opponent (described as &quot;brother Ar.&quot;, to be identified with Arnaud Gaillard, then a formed bachelor back from Paris) voiced his opposition to Olivi&#x27;s views on the Franciscan vow of poverty, which prompted him to write a &quot;Treatise on poor use&quot; (&quot;De usu paupere&quot;). The controversy between the two young theologians raged on many different issues, which attracted the attention of the General Chapter of Strasbourg in 1282. Only Olivi&#x27;s fate is recorded, but both were probably suspended from teaching. His doctrine was examined by seven Franciscan theologians at Paris, who first drew up a list of errors (&quot;Littera septem sigillorum&quot;) and then substantiated it by a roll (&quot;rotulus&quot;) of citations from Olivi&#x27;s writings.
Olivi defended himself in several responses (1283–85), and finally the General Chapter of Montpellier (1287) decided in his favor. The new general superior, Matthew of Aquasparta, sent him as lector in theology to the convent of Santa Croce in Florence. Next, Matthew&#x27;s successor, Raymond Gaufredi, sent Olivi back to Montpellier as lector in theology. At the General Chapter of Paris in 1292, Olivi again gave explanations, which were apparently satisfactory. He spent his last years in the convent of Narbonne lecturing and writing his masterwork on the &quot;Apocalypse of John&quot;, revising his commentary on the &quot;Sentences of Peter Lombard&quot;, corresponding, and acting as pastor to a community of &quot;Spiritual&quot; Franciscans and devout laypersons. He died surrounded by his friends, who familiarly called him &quot;Saint Peter,&quot; after an earnest profession of his Catholic Faith (published by Wadding ad a. 1297, n. 33) on 14 March 1298.

== Characteristic teaching ==
A glance at Olivi’s literary output indicates—considering his relatively short life of fifty years, full-time teaching duties, and lost years when he lived under the cloud that “Friar Ar.” cast over him—that he was remarkably productive.  A near contemporary stated, not quite accurately, that he had written commentaries on every book in the Bible: he never fulfilled his plan to comment on the prophecy of Daniel or the epistles to the Corinthians.

Olivi commented on the Lombard’s &quot;Sentences—&quot;much of &quot;Book III&quot; and &quot;IV,&quot; and all of &quot;Book II&quot; in which he demonstrated himself to be an unsurpassed proponent of human free will. He was also a prominent critic of Averroës. His indirect, fragmentary commentary on Lombard &quot;Book I&quot;, &quot;De Deo Cognoscendo,&quot; is published as an appendix to the commentary on the Lombard&#x27;s &quot;Sentences&quot; &quot;Book&quot; &quot;II&quot; (pp. 525–554). His argument there carries Anselm’s ontological argument to its fullness by affirming the superlative perfection (&quot;summe infinitum&quot;) of all of God’s attributes in a way analogous to, and reflective of, Olivi’s “superabundant hermeneutics” of the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (See Lewis, &quot;Olivi’s Revelation&quot;, “Olivi’s Superabundant Hermeneutics”).

Olivi’s thinking and large body of writing on “evangelical poverty” has been much discussed, and made of him the leader of the so-called “Spiritual Franciscans,” oft maligned by the 14th-century papacy and others more interested in wealth than in the spirituality of Gospel self-control. He was a consistent believer in, and practitioner of, the holy life as taught by Jesus, lived by the Apostles, and restored to the church by Francis of Assisi, without, however, indulging in the personal extremism that characterized certain skeletal figures. Olivi’s work on contracts demonstrates his ability to think outside the realm of religion, and his balanced and reasonable attitude towards the appropriate use of money. Olivi was interested in practical matters as well as philosophy. His work &quot;On Sale, Purchase, Usury and Restitution&quot;, or more simply &quot;On Contracts&quot; (as in the latest edition by S. Piron, 2012), contains a subtle discussion of the pricing of risks and probabilities in connection with valuing compensation due for compulsory requisitioning of property. This work has earned for Olivi a place in the history of the development of thinking about the right use of capital.

Olivi’s rethinking of the meaning of the Bible on it own terms, apart from Aristotelian categories, in some cases led to a refreshing reliance on the simple meaning of the text, and in other cases to an unparalleled theological inventiveness. Olivi was unique in the 13th century, for example, in his realization of the Jewish quality of the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (cf. Lewis, &quot;Olivi’s Revelation,&quot; “Olivi and the Jews”). He identified the “144,000 Friends of the Lamb” (Rev 7:4-8,14:1-5) as a Jewish, militant wing of the Church of the Endtime. Fascinated by Jewish music, Olivi, described the two wings of the Apocalyptic army, Jew and Gentile, as playing their harps and singing a twofold song in unison, the &quot;Song of Moses&quot; &quot;and the Lamb&quot; (Rev 15:3). Olivi foresaw a reunion of Jew and Gentile in the one People of God at the End as it had been at the Beginning. Quite the reverse of the Churchmen and Royals who in 1306, scarcely eight years after Olivi’s death, led France and Olivi’s neighbors into yet another spasm of European anti-semitism.  

==Legacy and controversy==
Controversy continued after his death. His friends, friars and laity alike, venerated their leader, and even honored his tomb as that of a saint; on the other hand, the General Chapter of Lyon in 1299, ordered his writings to be collected and burned as heretical.
The General Council of Vienne in 1312 established in the Decretal &quot;Fidei catholicæ fundamento&quot; (Bull. Franc., V, 86) the Catholic doctrine against three points of Olivi&#x27;s teaching, although without mentioning Olivi by name. These points were:
* the moment when Christ&#x27;s body on the cross was transfixed by the lance
* the manner in which the soul is united to the body
* the baptism of infants. 

In 1318, anti-Olivi Friars destroyed Olivi&#x27;s tomb, and are presumed to have thrown his body in the Rôhne River. In the next year, two further steps were taken against him. His writings were absolutely forbidden by the General Chapter of Marseilles, and a special commission of theologians examined Olivi&#x27;s &quot;Lectura super Apocalypsim&quot; and marked sixty sentences as heretical, chiefly citations of Joachim of Flora. In 1326, those sentences were condemned by Pope John XXII when the use of them by Emperor Louis IV the Bavarian in his Appeal of Sachsenhausen (1324) came to the attention of the Pope. Though Olivi was never officially condemned as a heretic, his name was included as a banned author in several editions of the &quot;Index of Prohibited Books&quot;.

Franz Ehrle considers (&quot;Archiv, III&quot;, 440) that Olivi was not the impious heretic that he was painted to be in some writings of his opponents, and states (ibid., 448) that the denunciation of his theological doctrine was rather a tactical measure of the adversaries of the rigorous principles of poverty and reform professed by Olivi. It is clear that Olivi follows in many points the doctrine of St. Bonaventure, but equally clear that in his &quot;Lectura super Apocalypsim&quot; he was a thoroughgoing follower of Joachim&quot;,&quot; which, for some, was enough to mark him as a heretic.

<text>Epaminondas is a strategy board game invented by Robert Abbott in 1975. The game is named after the Theban general Epaminondas, known for the use of phalanx strategy in combat. The concept of the phalanx is integral to the game.

Epaminondas was originally introduced in Sid Sackson&#x27;s &quot;A Gamut of Games&quot; as &quot;Crossings&quot;. While the original version used an 8×8 checkerboard, the current game uses a 12×14 board and different rules for capture. When published, it claimed to be one of the first modern games to acknowledge the name of its inventor in its rules.

==Phalanx==
In the game, a &quot;phalanx&quot; is a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of two or more stones of the same color, with no empty spaces or enemy stones between them. A stone may belong to more than one phalanx, depending on the direction considered.

==Rules==
===Moves===
White moves first; then turns alternate.
* A player can move a single piece one space in any direction (the same as a king in chess).
* A player can, instead, move a phalanx any number of spaces equal to or less than the number of pieces in the phalanx. All the pieces in the phalanx must all move in the same direction, and that direction must be along the &quot;line&quot; of the phalanx. (For example, a phalanx of three stones along a diagonal can move three, two, or one spaces along that diagonal.)
** A player does not have to move an entire phalanx; the player can &quot;split&quot; the phalanx into two parts as long as the subset moved is continuous and moves no further than its length.
** A phalanx cannot move through or across pieces of the same color.
* To keep the game from ending in a draw due to copycat moves, there is an additional rule: no player may move a piece onto their opponent&#x27;s home row if that move creates a pattern of left-to-right symmetry on the board.

===Captures===
Only phalanxes can make captures. Capturing is never compulsory.
The head piece of a phalanx may land on an enemy stone if the number of the following opponent&#x27;s stones, in the direction of the phalanx movement and including the stone directly hit, is strictly smaller than the number of stones in the moving phalanx. In that case, those opponent&#x27;s stones are captured.
This means, a phalanx of length &quot;n&quot; may capture up to &quot;n-1&quot; stones.

===Winning===
A player wins when, at the start of their turn, they have strictly more pieces on their opponent&#x27;s home row than the opponent has on the player&#x27;s home row. (To clarify, if at the beginning of Black&#x27;s turn, Black has more pieces on row A than White has on row Z, Black wins. If at the beginning of White&#x27;s turn, White has more pieces on row Z than Black has on row A, White wins.) This allows an opponent the chance to capture some of the offending stones on the turn after an incursion, or to counterattack on the opposite side of the board.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Epaminondas&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, noting that &quot;It comes in a beautiful edition that makes watching the shifting board position all the more enjoyable.&quot;

<text>Samuel Rinnah Van Sant (May 11, 1844October 3, 1936) was an American politician who served in the Minnesota House of Representatives and as the 15th Governor of Minnesota.

==Early life==
Van Sant was born in Rock Island, Illinois, to John Wesley Van Sant and Lydia Van Sant (née Anderson). His family had a long history in the shipbuilding industry and his father worked with building and repairing steamboats on the Mississippi River. Van Sant attended school in Rock Island. When the American Civil War began, he attempted to enlist but was rejected as too young. After getting written permission from his father, Van Sant was accepted and served with the 9th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry for three years before being mustered out.

After the war, Van Sant took business classes in Hudson, New York, and briefly attended Knox College in Illinois before leaving school due to a lack of money. He worked with his father in the shipbuilding trade and helped develop specialized raft boats for moving lumber along the river. In 1883, he relocated to Winona, Minnesota.

==Career==
After arriving in Winona, Van Sant continued to work in the shipbuilding and lumber rafting industries. By the 1890s, he had become financially successful and his company was responsible for moving more lumber down the Mississippi River than any other.

He also became active with local Republican politics. In 1892, he was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives and served two consecutive terms from 1893 to 1897. In his second term, he served as the Speaker of the House.

In 1900, he ran for governor against incumbent John Lind and won, serving two terms, from 1901 to 1905. As governor, Van Sant filed a lawsuit against the Northern Securities Company railroad trust arguing that its formation violated a state law. His case was later taken up at the federal level by President Theodore Roosevelt and, in the 1904 United States Supreme court case Northern Securities Co. v. United States, the company was dissolved. He was also involved in legislation which updated the state&#x27;s election process and removed restrictions on the state legislature&#x27;s taxation and spending powers.

After serving as Governor Van Sant retired from politics. He was commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1909 to 1910.

He died in 1936 in Attica, Indiana, age 92. He is buried in Glendale Cemetery in Le Claire, Iowa.

The Samuel Van Sant House in Le Claire, Iowa is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="251366" wikidata="Q104962" url="?curid=251366" title="Hypotenuse">
<text>In geometry, a hypotenuse is the side of a right triangle opposite the right angle. It is the longest side of any such triangle; the two other shorter sides of such a triangle are called &quot;catheti&quot; or &quot;legs&quot;. The length of the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs. Mathematically, this can be written as formula_1, where &quot;a&quot; is the length of one leg, &quot;b&quot; is the length of another leg, and &quot;c&quot; is the length of the hypotenuse.

For example, if one of the legs of a right angle has a length of 3 and the other has a length of 4, then their squares add up to 25 = 9 + 16 = 3 × 3 + 4 × 4. Since 25 is the square of the hypotenuse, the length of the hypotenuse is the square root of 25, that is, 5. In other words, if formula_2 and formula_3, then formula_4.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;hypotenuse&quot; is derived from Greek (sc. or ), meaning &quot;[side] subtending the right angle&quot; (Apollodorus), &quot;hupoteinousa&quot; being the feminine present active participle of the verb &quot;hupo-teinō&quot; &quot;to stretch below, to subtend&quot;, from &quot;teinō&quot; &quot;to stretch, extend&quot;. The nominalised participle, , was used for the hypotenuse of a triangle in the 4th century BCE (attested in Plato, &quot;Timaeus&quot; 54d). The Greek term was loaned into Late Latin, as &quot;hypotēnūsa&quot;. The spelling in &quot;-e&quot;, as &quot;hypotenuse&quot;, is French in origin (Estienne de La Roche 1520).
==Properties and calculations==
In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the side that is opposite the right angle, while the other two sides are called the &quot;catheti&quot; or &quot;legs&quot;. The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated using the square root function implied by the Pythagorean theorem. It states that the sum of the two legs squared equals the hypotenuse squared. In mathematical notation, with the respective legs labelled formula_5 and formula_6, and the hypotenuse labelled formula_7, it is written as Using the square root function on both sides of the equation, it follows that
:formula_8
This calculation of formula_7 from formula_5 and formula_6 is called Pythagorean addition, and is available in many software libraries as the codice_1 function.

As a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse is the longest side of any right triangle; that is, the hypotenuse is longer than either of the triangle&#x27;s legs. For example, given the length of the legs &quot;a&quot; = 5 and &quot;b&quot; = 12, then the sum of the legs squared is (5 × 5) + (12 × 12) = 169, the square of the hypotenuse. The length of the hypotenuse is thus the square root of 169, denoted formula_12, which equals 13.

The Pythagorean theorem, and hence this length, can also be derived from the law of cosines in trigonometry. In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the leg adjacent of the angle and the hypotenuse. For a right angle &quot;γ&quot; (gamma), where the adjacent leg equals 0, the cosine of &quot;γ&quot; also equals 0. The law of cosines formulates that formula_13 holds for some angle &quot;θ&quot; (theta). By observing that the angle opposite the hypotenuse is right and noting that its cosine is 0, so in this case &quot;θ&quot; = &quot;γ&quot; = 90°:

:formula_14

Many computer languages support the ISO C standard function hypot(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), which returns the value above. The function is designed not to fail where the straightforward calculation might overflow or underflow and can be slightly more accurate and sometimes significantly slower.

Some languages have extended the definition to higher dimensions. For example, C++17 supports formula_15; this gives the length of the diagonal of a rectangular cuboid with edges &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;. Python 3.8 extended formula_16 to handle an arbitrary number of arguments. 

Some scientific calculators provide a function to convert from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. This gives both the length of the hypotenuse and the angle the hypotenuse makes with the base line (&quot;c1&quot; above) at the same time when given &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. The angle returned is normally given by atan2(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;x&quot;).

== Trigonometric ratios ==
By means of trigonometric ratios, one can obtain the value of two acute angles, formula_17and formula_18, of the right triangle.

Given the length of the hypotenuse formula_19and of a cathetus formula_20, the ratio is:

:::formula_21

The trigonometric inverse function is:

:::formula_22
in which formula_23 is the angle opposite the cathetus formula_20.

The adjacent angle of the catheti formula_20 is formula_17 = 90° – formula_23

One may also obtain the value of the angle formula_23by the equation:

:::formula_29

in which formula_30 is the other cathetus.

<text>John Albert Johnson (July 28, 1861September 21, 1909) was an American politician. He served in the Minnesota State Senate from January 1897 to January 1901. He was the 16th governor of Minnesota from January 4, 1905, until his death on September 21, 1909 as a member of the Democratic Party.

Johnson was the first Minnesota governor born in Minnesota. He was only the second non-Republican governor in 45 years and the third since statehood. He was also first to serve a full term in the present state capitol, and the first to die in office. Johnson sought the 1908 Democratic presidential nomination but lost to William Jennings Bryan.

==Biography==

John Albert Johnson was born on a farm near St. Peter, Minnesota, on July 28, 1861, the eldest child of Gustaf and Caroline Johnson. After Gustaf abandoned his family, John left school at 13 to support his mother and siblings. During this time, he worked at a local drugstore. After that, he had a seven-year-long stint in the Minnesota National guard, where he reached the rank of captain. Local Democrats, impressed with the enterprising young store clerk, asked him to join their party and edit the strongly Democratic &quot;St. Peter Herald&quot;. Before he could take the position, he became seriously ill with typhoid fever, but he recovered. His journalistic success attracted statewide attention and fostered political aspirations.

Johnson married Elinor M. Preston on June 1, 1894, at the Union Presbyterian Church in St. Peter.

Johnson failed in early campaigns for state office from his heavily Republican home county but was elected to the state senate in 1898, indicating his growing bipartisan appeal.

==Governor==
Several reforms of a progressive nature were carried out during Johnson&#x27;s tenure. In his 1904 inauguration speech, Johnson called for the 2-year term to be extended to 4 years, more funding for roads, more funding to rural schools, and several other important ideas. Johnson&#x27;s ability to reason and work with legislators of both parties resulted in such reform legislation as a reorganization of the state&#x27;s insurance department to the benefit of policyholders, reduction of railroad passenger and freight rates, and removal of constitutional restraints on the legislature&#x27;s power to tax. Johnson was reelected in 1906 and 1908. He began his third term with reservations. At that point, he had had over four surgeries for his intestinal problems, and wanted to pursue a promising sideline as a public orator. His chronic illness forced him to head to the Mayo Clinic once again on September 13, 1909. When he died suddenly at age 48 from post-operative complications, which included an infection, the state&#x27;s citizens were grief-stricken.

==Legacy==

Johnson was the first of three governors to die in office. Governor Winfield Scott Hammond was the second, after suffering a stroke in 1915. Floyd B. Olson was the third and most recent, dying of cancer in 1936.

Statues of Johnson are on the steps of the Minnesota State Capitol and the grounds of the Nicollet County Courthouse. Johnson Senior High School in St. Paul is named for him, as is the portion of U.S. Route 169 from Saint Peter to the Twin Cities.

The John A. Johnson School in Virginia, Minnesota was built in 1907.

<text>Adolph Olson Eberhart (June 30, 1870 – December 6, 1944) was an American politician, who served as the 17th Governor of Minnesota.

==Background==
Adolph Olson Eberhart was born in Kil, in Värmland, Sweden, the son of Andrew and Louise Olson. Because of bad economic conditions, Andrew, Louise and all of the family except Adolph immigrated to St. Peter, Minnesota. In 1882, Adolph joined the family there. Eberhart graduated from Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, Minnesota (1895) and studied law in a law office in Mankato, Minnesota.

==Career==

Eberhart was a member of the Minnesota State Senate from January 1903 to January 1907. He was elected the 17th Lieutenant Governor in 1906. He became the 17th Governor of Minnesota on September 21, 1909, when Governor John Albert Johnson died, and served until January 5, 1915. Eberhart was a Republican. Minnesota elected Governors and Lt. Governors on separate ballots until 1974, so it happened occasionally that the two were of different parties. Elected the youngest member of the state senate in 1902, the Republican Eberhart was chosen as lieutenant governor four years later in the administration of the legendary Democrat, John Albert Johnson. Although his first partial term as governor resulted from Johnson&#x27;s death in 1909, he subsequently won the office twice on his own merits.

An efficient administrator, Eberhart was also a consummate politician, and his detractors, including many Republicans, questioned his sincerity as well as the reputation of certain close associates. To assure his re-nomination in 1912, he called a special 13-day legislative session and deflated his critics by bulldozing through such progressive reforms as rural school consolidation and primary elections. Eberhart&#x27;s strategy worked; he avoided the censure of his own party and was re-nominated for a second full term in the first statewide primary.

Eberhart lost his re-nomination bid for a fourth term as governor. A second defeat in the 1916 U.S. Senate primary marked the end of his political career. After a career as a real estate and insurance executive in Chicago, he retired to a rest home where he died in Savage, Minnesota. 
An inventory of his gubernatorial records is maintained at the Minnesota Historical Society Library.

<doc id="251370" wikidata="Q505146" url="?curid=251370" title="Joseph Brant">
<text>Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant (March 1743 – November 24, 1807) was a Mohawk military and political leader, based in present-day New York and, later, Brantford, in what is today Ontario, who was closely associated with Great Britain during and after the American Revolution. Perhaps the best known Native American of his generation, he met many of the most significant American and British people of the age, including both United States President George Washington and King George III of Great Britain.

While not born into a hereditary leadership role within the Iroquois Confederacy, Brant rose to prominence due to his education, abilities, and connections to British officials. His sister, Molly Brant, was the wife of Sir William Johnson, the influential British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Province of New York. During the American Revolutionary War, Brant led Mohawk and colonial Loyalists known as Brant&#x27;s Volunteers against the rebels in a bitter partisan war on the New York frontier. He was falsely accused by the Americans of committing atrocities and given the name &quot;Monster Brant.&quot;

In 1784, Quebec Governor Frederick Haldimand, issued a proclamation that granted Brant and his followers land to replace what they had lost in New York during the Revolution. This tract was about in size, 12 miles (19.2 kilometers) wide along the whole length of the Ouse or Grand River in what is now southwestern Ontario. Brant relocated with many of the Iroquois to the area where the Six Nations Reserve is now located, and remained a prominent leader until his death.

==Early years==
Brant was born in the Ohio Country in March 1743, somewhere along the Cuyahoga River during the hunting season when the Mohawk traveled to the area from Kanienkeh (&quot;the Land of the Flint&quot;), the Mohawk name for their homeland in what is present-day Upstate New York. He was named Thayendanegea, which in the Mohawk language means &quot;He places two bets together&quot;, which came from the custom of tying the wagered items to each other when two parties placed a bet. As the Mohawk were a matrilineal culture, he was born into his mother&#x27;s Wolf Clan. The Haudenosaunee League, of which the Mohawks were one of the Six Nations, was divided into clans headed by clan mothers. Anglican Church records at Fort Hunter, New York, noted that his parents were Christians and their names were Peter and Margaret Tehonwaghkwangearahkwa. His father died when Joseph was young. One of Brant&#x27;s friends in later life, John Norton, wrote that Brant&#x27;s parents were not born Iroquois, but were rather Hurons taken captive by the Iroquois as young people; the Canadian historian James Paxton wrote this claim was &quot;plausible&quot; but &quot;impossible to verify&quot;, going on to write that this issue is really meaningless as the Iroquois considered anybody raised as an Iroquois to be Iroquois, drawing no line between those born Iroquois and those adopted by the Iroquois.

After his father&#x27;s death, his mother Margaret (Owandah) returned to New York from Ohio with Joseph and his sister Mary (also known as Molly). His mother remarried, and her new husband was known by whites as Barnet or Bernard, which was commonly contracted to Brandt or Brant. Molly Brant may have actually been Brant&#x27;s half-sister rather than his sister, but in Mohawk society, they would have been considered full siblings as they shared the same mother. They settled in Canajoharie, a Mohawk village on the Mohawk River, where they had lived previously. The Mohawk, in common with the other nations of the Haudenosaunee League, had a very gendered understanding of social roles with power divided by the male (chiefs or sachems) and the clan mothers (who always nominated the male leaders). Decisions were reached by consensus between the clan mothers and the chiefs. Mohawk women did all the farming, growing the &quot;Three Sisters&quot; of beans, corn, and squash, while men went hunting and engaged in diplomacy and wars. In the society in which Brant grew up, there was an expectation that he would be a warrior as a man.

The part of the New York frontier where Brant grew up had been settled in the early 18th century by immigrants known as the Palatines, from the Electoral Palatinate in what is now Germany. Relations between the Palatines and Mohawks were friendly, with many Mohawk families renting out land to be farmed by the Palatines (though Mohawk elders complained that their young people were too fond of the beer brewed by the Palatines). Thus Brant grew up in a multicultural world surrounded by people speaking Mohawk, German, and English. Paxton wrote that Brant self-identified as Mohawk, but because he also grew up with the Palatines, Scots, and Irish living in his part of Kanienkeh, he was comfortable with aspects of European culture. The common Mohawk surname Brant was merely the Anglicized version of the common German surname Brandt.

Brant&#x27;s mother Margaret was a successful businesswoman who collected and sold ginseng, which was greatly valued in Europe for its medical qualities, selling the plant to New York merchants who shipped it to London. Through her involvement in the ginseng trade, Margaret first met William Johnson, a merchant, fur trader, and land speculator from Ireland, who was much respected by the Mohawk for his honesty, being given the name Warraghiagey (&quot;He Who Does Much Business&quot;) and who lived in a mansion known as Fort Johnson by the banks of the Mohawk river. Johnson, who was fluent in Mohawk and who lived with two Mohawk women in succession as his common-law wives, had much influence in Kanienkeh. Among the white population, the Butler and Croghan families were close to Johnson while the influential Mohawk families of Hill, Peters and Brant were also his friends. Johnson&#x27;s Mohawk wife, Caroline, was the niece of the Hendrick Tejonihokarawa, known as &quot;King Hendrick&quot;, who visited London to meet Queen Anne in 1710.

In 1752, Margaret began living with Brant Canagaraduncka (alternative spelling: Kanagaraduncka), a Mohawk , and in March 1753 bore him a son named Jacob, which greatly offended the local Church of England minister, the Reverend John Ogilvie, when he discovered that they were not married. On September 9, 1753, his mother married Canagaraduncka at the local Anglican church. Canagaraduncka was also a successful businessman, living in a two-story European style house with all of the luxuries that would be expected in a middle class English household of the period. Her new husband&#x27;s family had ties with the British; his grandfather Sagayeathquapiethtow was one of the Four Mohawk Kings to visit England in 1710. The marriage bettered Margaret&#x27;s fortunes, and the family lived in the best house in Canajoharie. Her new alliance conferred little status on her children as Mohawk titles and leadership positions descended through the female line.

Canagaraduncka was a friend of William Johnson, the influential and wealthy British Superintendent for Northern Indian Affairs, who had been knighted for his service. During Johnson&#x27;s frequent visits to the Mohawk, he always stayed at the Brants&#x27; house. Brant&#x27;s half-sister Molly established a relationship with Johnson, who was a highly successful trader and landowner. His mansion Johnson Hall impressed the young Brant so much that he decided to stay with Molly and Johnson. Johnson took an interest in the youth and supported his English-style education, as well as introducing him to influential leaders in the New York colony. Brant was described as a teenager as an easy-going and affable man who spent his days wandering around the countryside and forests with his circle of friends, hunting and fishing. During his hunting and fishing expeditions, which lasted for days and sometimes weeks, Brant often stopped by at the homes of Palatine and Scots-Irish settlers to ask for food, refreshment and to talk. Brant was well remembered for his charm, with one white woman who let Brant stay with her family for a couple of days in exchange for him sharing some of the deer he killed and to provide a playmate for her boys who were about the same age, recalling after the Revolutionary War that she could never forget his &quot;manly bearing&quot; and &quot;noble goodhearted&quot; ways.

In 1753, relations between the League and the British had become badly strained as land speculators from New York began to seize land belonging to the Iroquois. Led by chief Hendrick Theyanoguin, known to the British as Hendrick Peters, a delegation arrived in Albany to tell the Governor of New York, George Clinton: &quot;The Covenant Chain is broken between you and us. So brother you are not to expect to hear of me any more and Brother we desire to hear no more of you&quot;. The end of the &quot;Covenant Chain&quot; as the Anglo-Iroquois alliance had been known since the 17th century was considered a major change in the balance of power in North America. In 1754, the British with the Virginia militia led by George Washington in the French and Indian War in the Ohio river valley were defeated by the French, and in 1755 a British expedition into the Ohio river valley led by General Edward Braddock was annihilated by the French.

Johnson, as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, had the task of persuading the Iroquois Six Nations to fight in the Seven Years&#x27; War on the side of the British Crown, despite their own inclinations towards neutrality, and on June 21, 1755, called a conference at Fort Johnson with the Iroquois chiefs and clan mothers to ask them to fight in the war and offered them many gifts. As a 12-year-old, Brant attended the conference, though his role was only as an observer who was there to learn the ways of diplomacy. At the Battle of Lake George, Johnson led a force of British Army troops raised in New York together with Iroquois against the French, where he won a costly victory. As the Iroquois disliked taking heavy losses in war owing to their small population, the Battle of Lake George which had cost the Iroquois many dead set off a deep period of mourning across Kanienkeh and much of the Six Nations leadership swung behind a policy of neutrality again. Johnson was to be sorely tried during the next years as the Crown pressed him to get the Iroquois to fight again while most of the Six Nations made it clear that they wanted no more fighting. Kanagradunckwa was one of the few Mohawk chiefs who favored continuing to fight in the war, which won him much gratitude from Johnson.

==Seven Years&#x27; War and education==

Starting at about age 15 during the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War), Brant took part with Mohawk and other Iroquois allies in a number of British actions against the French in Canada: James Abercrombie&#x27;s 1758 expedition via Lake George that ended in utter defeat at Fort Carillon; Johnson&#x27;s 1759 Battle of Fort Niagara; and Jeffery Amherst&#x27;s 1760 expedition to Montreal via the St. Lawrence River. He was one of 182 Native American warriors awarded a silver medal from the British for his service.

At Fort Carillon (modern Ticonderoga, New York), Brant and the other Mohawk warriors watched the battle from a hill, seeing the British infantry being cut down by the French fire, and returned home without joining the action, being thankful that Abercrombie had assigned the task of storming the fort to the British Army and keeping the Mohawks serving only as scouts. However, the expedition to Fort Carillon introduced Brant to three men who were figure prominently later in his life, namely Guy Johnson, John Butler, and Daniel Claus. At about the same time, Brant&#x27;s sister, Molly moved into Fort Johnson to become Johnson&#x27;s common-law wife. The Iroquois did not see anything wrong with the relationship between the twenty-something Molly and the forty-five year old Johnson, and shortly before moving into Fort Johnson, Molly gave birth to a son, Peter Warren Johnson, the first of the eight children she was to have by Sir William.

During the siege of Fort Niagara, Brant served as a scout. Along with a force of British Army soldiers, New York militiamen, and other Iroquois warriors, he took part in an ambush of a French relief force at the Battle of La Belle-Famille, which may have been the first time that Brant saw action. The French force, while marching through the forest towards Fort Niagara, were annihilated during the ambush. On July 25, 1759, Fort Niagara surrendered. In 1760, Brant joined the expeditionary force under General Jeffrey Amherst, which left Fort Oswego on August 11 with the goal of taking Montreal. After taking Fort Lévis on the St. Lawrence, Amherst refused to allow the Indians to enter the fort, fearing that they would massacre the French prisoners in order to take scalps, which caused the majority of the Six Nations warriors to go home, as they wanted to join the British in plundering the fort. Brant stayed on and in September 1760 helped to take Montreal.

In 1761, Johnson arranged for three Mohawk, including Brant, to be educated at Eleazar Wheelock&#x27;s &quot;Moor&#x27;s Indian Charity School&quot; in Connecticut. This was the forerunner of Dartmouth College, which was later established in New Hampshire. Brant studied under the guidance of Wheelock, who wrote that the youth was &quot;of a sprightly genius, a manly and gentle deportment, and of a modest, courteous and benevolent temper&quot;. Brant learned to speak, read, and write English, as well as studying other academic subjects. Brant was taught how to farm at the school (considered to be woman&#x27;s work by the Iroquois), math and the classics. Europeans were afterwards astonished when Brant was to speak of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; to them. He met Samuel Kirkland at the school, later a missionary to Indians in western New York. On May 15, 1763, a letter arrived from Molly Brant at the school ordering her younger brother to return at once, and he left in July. In 1763, Johnson prepared for Brant to attend King&#x27;s College in New York City.

The outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion upset his plans, and Brant returned home to avoid hostility toward Native Americans. After Pontiac&#x27;s rebellion, Johnson did not think it safe for Brant to return to King&#x27;s College. The ideology behind Pontiac&#x27;s war was of a pan-Indian theology that at first appeared in the 1730s being taught by various prophets, most notably the Lenape prophet Neolin, which held the Indians and whites were different peoples created by the Master of Life who belonged on different continents and urged the rejection of all aspects of European life. In Kanienkeh, the Mohawks had sufficiently good relations with their Palatine and Scots-Irish neighbours that Neolin&#x27;s anti-white message never caught on. Pontiac&#x27;s War caused panic all over the frontier as the news that various Indian tribes had united against the British and were killing all whites, causing terrified white settlers to flee to the nearest British Army forts all over the frontier. Johnson as the superintendent of northern Indian affairs was heavily involved in diplomatic efforts to keep more Indian tribes from joining Pontiac&#x27;s war, and Brant often served as his emissary. During Pontiac&#x27;s rebellion, leaders on both sides tended to see the war as a racial war in which no mercy was to be given, and Brant&#x27;s status as an Indian loyal to the Crown was a difficult one. Even his former teacher Wheelock wrote to Johnson, asking if it was true that Brant &quot;had put himself at the Head of a large party of Indians to fight against the English&quot;. Brant did not abandon his interest in the Church of England, studying at a missionary school operated by the Reverend Cornelius Bennet of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in Canajoharie. However, in Mohawk society, men made their reputations as warriors, not scholars, and Brant abandoned his studies to fight for the Crown against Pontiac&#x27;s forces.

In February 1764, Brant went on the warpath, joining a force of Mohawk and Oneida warriors to fight for the British. On his way, Brant stayed at the village of Oquaga, whose chief Issac was a Christian, and who became Brant&#x27;s friend. Brant may have had an ulterior motive when staying with Issac or perhaps romance blossomed, for Issac&#x27;s daughter was soon to become his wife. In March 1764, Brant participated in one of the Iroquois war parties that attacked Lenape villages in the Susquehanna and Chemung valleys. They destroyed three good-sized towns, burning 130 houses and killing the cattle. No enemy warriors were seen. The Algonquian-speaking Lenape and Iroquois belonged to two different language families; they were traditional competitors and often warred at their frontiers.

==Marriages and family==
On July 22, 1765, in Canajoharie, Brant married Peggie, also known as Margaret. Said to be the daughter of Virginia planters, Peggie had been taken captive when young by Native Americans. After becoming assimilated with midwestern Indians, she was sent to the Mohawk. They lived with his parents, who passed the house on to Brant after his stepfather&#x27;s death. He also owned a large and fertile farm of near the village of Canajoharie on the south shore of the Mohawk River; this village was also known as the Upper Mohawk Castle. Brant and Peggie raised corn and kept cattle, sheep, horses, and hogs. He also kept a small store. Brant dressed in &quot;the English mode&quot; wearing &quot;a suit of blue broad cloth&quot;.

Peggie and Brant had two children together, Isaac and Christine, before Peggie died from tuberculosis in March 1771. Brant later killed his son, Isaac, in a physical confrontation. Brant married a second wife, Susanna, but she died near the end of 1777 during the American Revolutionary War, when they were staying at Fort Niagara.

While still based at Fort Niagara, Brant started living with Catharine &quot;Adonwentishon&quot; Croghan, whom he married in the winter of 1780. She was the daughter of Catharine (&quot;Tekarihoga&quot;), a Mohawk, and George Croghan, the prominent Irish colonist and British Indian agent, deputy to William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District. Through her mother, &quot;Adonwentishon&quot; became clan mother of the Turtle clan, the first in rank in the Mohawk Nation. The Mohawk had a matrilineal kinship system, with inheritance and descent through the maternal line. As the clan matriarch, Adonwentishon had the birth right of naming the &quot;Tekarihoga&quot;, the principal hereditary sachem of the Mohawk who would come from her clan. Through his marriage to Catherine, Brant also became connected to John Smoke Johnson, a Mohawk godson of Sir William Johnson and relative of Hendrick Theyanoguin.

With Catherine Croghan, Brant had seven children: Joseph, Jacob (1786–1847), John (selected by Catherine as &quot;Tekarihoga&quot; at the appropriate time; he never married), Margaret, Catherine, Mary, and Elizabeth (who married William Johnson Kerr, grandson of Sir William Johnson and Molly Brant; their son later became a chief among the Mohawk).

==Career==
With Johnson&#x27;s encouragement, the Mohawk named Brant as a war chief and their primary spokesman. Brant lived in Oswego, working as a translator with his then-wife Peggy, also known as Neggen or Aoghyatonghsera, where she gave birth to a son who was named Issac after her father. At the end of the year, the Brants moved to back to his hometown of Canajoharie to live with his mother. Brant owned about 80 acres of land in Canajoharie, though it is not clear who worked it. For the Mohawk, farming was woman&#x27;s work, and Brant would have been mocked by his fellow Mohawk men if he farmed his land himself. It is possible that Brant hired women to work his land, as no surviving record mentions anything about Brant being ridiculed in Canajoharie for farming his land. In 1769, Neggen gave birth to Brant&#x27;s second child, a daughter named Christina. In early 1771, Neggen died of tuberculosis, leaving the widower Brant with two children to raise.

In the spring of 1772, Brant moved to Fort Hunter to stay with the Reverend John Stuart. He became Stuart&#x27;s interpreter and teacher of Mohawk, collaborating with him to translate the Anglican catechism and the Gospel of Mark into the Mohawk language. His interest in translating Christian texts had begun during his early education. At Moor&#x27;s Charity School for Indians, he did many translations. Brant became Anglican, a faith he held for the remainder of his life. Brant, who by all accounts was heartbroken by the death of his wife, found much spiritual comfort in the teachings of the Church of England. However, he was disappointed when the Reverend Stuart refused his request to marry him to Susanna, the sister of Neggen. For the Haudenosaunee, it was the normal custom for a widower to marry his sister-in-law to replace his lost wife, and Brant&#x27;s marriage to Susanna was considered to be quite acceptable to them.
Aside from being fluent in English, Brant spoke at least three, and possibly all, of the Six Nations&#x27; Iroquoian languages. From 1766 on, he worked as an interpreter for the British Indian Department. During this time, Brant became involved in a land dispute with Palatine fur trader George Klock who specialized in getting Mohawks drunk before having them sign over their land to him. Brant demanded that Klock stop obtaining land via this method and return the land he already owned. The dispute led Klock to sail to London in an attempt to have King George III support him, but he refused to see the &quot;notorious bad character&quot; Klock. Upon his return to the New York province, Brant stormed into Klock&#x27;s house in an attempt to intimidate him into returning the land he had signed over to him; the meeting ended with Mohawk warriors sacking Klock&#x27;s house while Klock later claimed that Brant had pistol-whipped him and left him bleeding and unconscious. At a meeting at Johnston Hall with the Haudenosaunee leaders, Johnson attempted to mediate the dispute with Klock and died later the same night. Though disappointed that Johnson was not more forceful in supporting the Haudenosaunee against Klock, Brant attended the Church of England services for Johnson, and then together with his sister Molly, Brant performed a traditional Iroquois Condolence ceremony for Johnson. Johnson Hall was inherited by his son John Johnson, who evicted his stepmother, Molly Brant, who returned to Canajoharie with the eight children she had borne Sir William to live with her mother. Sir John Johnson wished only to attend to his estate and did not share his father&#x27;s interests in the Mohawk. Daniel Claus, the right-hand man of Sir William, had gone to live in Montreal, and Guy Johnson, the kinsman of Sir William, lacked the charm and tact necessary to maintain social alliances.

Johnson&#x27;s death left a leadership vacuum in Tryon County which led to a group of colonists to form, on August 27, 1774, a Committee of Public Safety that was ostensibly concerned with enforcing the boycott of British goods ordered by the Continental Congress, but whose real purpose was to challenge the power of the Johnson family in Tryon County. In the summer and fall of 1774, Brant&#x27;s main concern was his ongoing dispute with Klock, but given his family&#x27;s close links with the Johnson family, he found himself opposing the Committee of Public Safety.
==American Revolution==

In 1775, he was appointed departmental secretary with the rank of Captain for the new British Superintendent&#x27;s Mohawk warriors from Canajoharie. In April 1775, the American Revolution began with fighting breaking out in Massachusetts, and in May 1775, Brant traveled to a meeting at German Flatts to discuss the crisis. While traveling to German Flatts, Brant felt first-hand the &quot;fear and hostility&quot; held by the whites of Tryon County who hated him both for his tactics against Klock and as a friend of the powerful Johnson family. Guy Johnson suggested that Brant go with him to Canada, saying that both their lives were in danger. When Loyalists were threatened after the war broke out in April 1775, Brant moved to the Province of Quebec, arriving in Montreal on July 17. The governor of Quebec, General Guy Carleton, personally disliked Johnson, felt his plans for employing the Iroquois against the rebels to be inhumane, and treated Brant with barely veiled contempt. Brant&#x27;s wife Susanna and children went to Onoquaga in south central New York, a Tuscarora Iroquois village along the Susquehanna River, the site of present-day Windsor.

On November 11, 1775, Guy Johnson took Brant with him to London to solicit more support from the government. They hoped to persuade the Crown to address past Mohawk land grievances in exchange for their participation as allies in the impending war. Brant met George III during his trip to London, but his most important talks were with the colonial secretary, George Germain. Brant complained that the Iroquois had fought for the British in the Seven Years&#x27; War, taking heavy losses, yet the British were allowing white settlers like Klock to defraud them of their land. The British government promised the Iroquois people land in Quebec if the Iroquois nations would fight on the British side in what was shaping up as open rebellion by the American colonists. In London, Brant was treated as a celebrity and was interviewed for publication by James Boswell. He was received by King George III at St. James&#x27;s Palace. While in public, he dressed in traditional Mohawk attire. He was accepted into freemasonry and received his ritual apron personally from King George.

Brant returned to Staten Island, New York, in July 1776. He participated with Howe&#x27;s forces as they prepared to retake New York. Although the details of his service that summer and fall were not officially recorded, Brant was said to have distinguished himself for bravery. He was thought to be with Clinton, Cornwallis, and Percy in the flanking movement at Jamaica Pass in the Battle of Long Island in August 1776. He became lifelong friends with Lord Percy, later Duke of Northumberland, in what was his only lasting friendship with a white man.

On his return voyage to New York City, Brant&#x27;s ship was attacked by an American privateer, during which he used one of the rifles he received in London to practice his sniping skills. In November, Brant left New York City and traveled northwest through Patriot-held territory. Disguised, traveling at night and sleeping during the day, he reached Onoquaga, where he rejoined his family. Brant asked the men of Onquaga to fight for the Crown, but the warriors favored neutrality, saying they wished to have no part in a war between white men. In reply, Brant stated that he had received promises in London that if the Crown won, Iroquois land rights would be respected while he predicted if the Americans won, then the Iroquois would lose their land, leading him to the conclusion that neutrality was not an option. Brant noted that George Washington had been a prominent investor in the Ohio Company, whose efforts to bring white settlement to the Ohio river valley had been the cause of such trouble to the Indians there, which he used to argue did not augur well if the Americans should win. More importantly, one of the &quot;oppressive&quot; acts of Parliament that had so incensed the Americans was the Royal Proclamation of 1763, forbidding white settlement beyond the Appalachians, which did not bode well for Indian land rights should the Americans be victorious.

Brant&#x27;s own relations with the British were strained. John Butler who was running the Indian Department in the absence of Guy Johnson had difficult relations with Brant. Brant found Butler patronizing while Brant&#x27;s friend Daniel Claus assured him that Butler&#x27;s behavior was driven by &quot;jealousy and envy&quot; at the charismatic Brant. At the end of December, Brant was at Fort Niagara. He traveled from village to village in the confederacy throughout the winter, urging the Iroquois to enter the war as British allies. Many Iroquois balked at Brant&#x27;s plans. In particular, the Oneida and Tuscarora gave Brant an unfriendly welcome. Louis Cook, a Mohawk leader who supported the rebel American colonists, became a lifelong enemy of Brant&#x27;s.

The full Grand Council of the Six Nations had previously decided on a policy of neutrality at Albany in 1775. They considered Brant a minor war chief and the Mohawk a relatively weak people. Frustrated, Brant returned to Onoquaga in the spring to recruit independent warriors. Few Onoquaga villagers joined him, but in May he was successful in recruiting Loyalists who wished to retaliate against the rebels. This group became known as Brant&#x27;s Volunteers. Brant&#x27;s Volunteers consisted of a few Mohawk and Tuscarora warriors and 80 white Loyalists. Paxton commented it was a mark of Brant&#x27;s charisma and renown that white Loyalists preferred to fight under the command of a Mohawk chief who was unable to pay or arm them while at the same time that only a few Iroquois joined him reflected the generally neutralist leanings of most of the Six Nations. The majority of the men in Brant&#x27;s Volunteers were white.

In June, he led them to Unadilla to obtain supplies. There he was confronted by 380 men of the Tryon County militia led by Nicholas Herkimer. The talks with Herkimer, a Palatine who had once been Brant&#x27;s neighbour and friend, were initially friendly. However, Herkimer&#x27;s chief of staff was Colonel Ebenezer Cox, the son-in-law of Brant&#x27;s archenemy Klock, and he continually made racist remarks to Brant, which at one point caused Brant&#x27;s Mohawk warriors to reach for their weapons. Brant and Herkimer were able to defuse the situation with Brant asking his warriors to step outside while Herkimer likewise told Cox to leave the room. Herkimer requested that the Iroquois remain neutral but Brant responded that the Indians owed their loyalty to the King.

===Northern campaign===
====Service as war leader, 1777–78 and &quot;Monster Brant&quot;====

In July 1777 the Six Nations council decided to abandon neutrality and enter the war on the British side. Four of the six nations chose this route, and some members of the Oneida and Tuscarora, who otherwise allied with the rebels. Brant was not present, but was deeply saddened when he learned that Six Nations had broken into two with the Oneida and Tuscarora supporting the Americans while the Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca chose the British. &quot;Sayenqueraghta&quot; and Cornplanter were named as the war chiefs of the confederacy. The Mohawk had earlier made Brant one of their war chiefs; they also selected John Deseronto.

In July, Brant led his Volunteers north to link up with Barry St. Leger at Fort Oswego. St. Leger&#x27;s plan was to travel downriver, east in the Mohawk River valley, to Albany, where he would meet the army of John Burgoyne, who was coming from Lake Champlain and the upper Hudson River. St. Leger&#x27;s expedition ground to a halt with the Siege of Fort Stanwix. General Herkimer raised the Tryon County militia, which consisted mostly of Palatines, to march for the relief of Fort Stanwix while Molly Brant passed along a message to her brother that Herkimer was coming. Brant played a major role in the Battle of Oriskany, where an American relief expedition was stopped on August 6. As Herkimer marched through the forest at the head of a force of 800, they were ambushed by the Loyalists, who brought down heavy fire from their positions in the forest. The Americans stood their ground, and after six hours of fighting, the battle ended inconclusively, though the Americans losses, at about 250 dead, were much greater than the Loyalist losses. The Canadian historian Desmond Morton described Brant&#x27;s Iroquois warriors as having &quot;annihilated a small American army&quot;.

Though Brant stopped Herkimer, the heavy losses taken by the Loyalist Iroquois at Oriskany led the battle to be considered a disaster by the Six Nations, for whom the loss of any life was unacceptable, making the 60 Iroquois dead at Oriskany a catastrophe by Iroquois standards. St. Leger was eventually forced to lift the siege when another American force approached, and Brant traveled to Burgoyne&#x27;s main army to inform him. The Oneida, who had sided with the Americans together with the Tryon County militia sacked Canajoharie, taking particular care to destroy Molly Brant&#x27;s house. Burgoyne restricted participation by native warriors, so Brant departed for Fort Niagara, where his family joined him and he spent the winter planning the next year&#x27;s campaign. His wife Susanna likely died at Fort Niagara that winter. (Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign ended with his surrender to the Patriots after the Battles of Saratoga.) Helping Brant&#x27;s career was the influence of his sister Molly, whom Daniel Claus had stated: &quot;one word from her [Molly Brant] is more taken notice of by the Five Nations than a thousand from a white man without exception&quot;. The British Army officers found Molly Brant to be bad-tempered and demanding, as she expected to be well rewarded for her loyalty to the Crown, but as she possessed much influence, it was felt to be worth keeping her happy.

In April 1778, Brant returned to Onoquaga. He became one of the most active partisan leaders in the frontier war. He and his Volunteers raided rebel settlements throughout the Mohawk Valley, stealing their cattle, burning their houses, and killing many. The British historian Michael Johnson called Brant the &quot;scourge of the American settlements of New York and Pennsylvania&quot;, being one of the most feared Loyalist irregular commanders in the war. Morton wrote the fighting on the New York frontier was not so much between Americans and the British as &quot;a cruel civil war between Loyalist and Patriot, Mohawk and Oneida, in a crude frontier tradition&quot;. On May 30, Brant led an attack on Cobleskill. At the Battle of the Cobleskill, Brant ambushed an American force of 50 men, consisting of Continental Army regulars and New York militiamen, killing 20 Americans and burning down the farms. In September, along with Captain William Caldwell, he led a mixed force of Indians and Loyalists in a raid on German Flatts. During the raid on German Flatts, Brant burned down almost the entire village, sparing only the church, the fort, and two houses belonging to Loyalists. Brant&#x27;s fame as a guerrilla leader was such that the Americans credited him with being behind any attack by Loyalist Haudenosaunee, even when he was not. In the Battle of Wyoming in July, the Seneca were accused of slaughtering noncombatant civilians. Although Brant was suspected of being involved, he did not participate in that battle, which nonetheless gave him the unflattering epithet of &quot;Monster Brant&quot;.

In September 1778 Brant&#x27;s forces attacked Percifer Carr&#x27;s farm where American scouts under Adam Helmer were based. Three of the scouts were killed. Helmer took off running to the north-east, through the hills, toward Schuyler Lake and then north to Andrustown (near present-day Jordanville, New York) where he warned his sister&#x27;s family of the impending raid and obtained fresh footwear. He also warned settlers at Columbia and Petrie&#x27;s Corners, most of whom then fled to safety at Fort Dayton. When Helmer arrived at the fort, severely torn up from his run, he told Colonel Peter Bellinger, the commander of the fort, that he had counted at least 200 of the attackers en route to the valley (see Attack on German Flatts). The straight-line distance from Carr&#x27;s farm to Fort Dayton is about thirty miles, and Helmer&#x27;s winding and hilly route was far from straight. It was said that Helmer then slept for 36 hours straight. During his sleep, on September 17, 1778, the farms of the area were destroyed by Brant&#x27;s raid. The total loss of property in the raid was reported as: 63 houses, 59 barns, full of grain, 3 grist mills, 235 horses, 229 horned cattle, 279 sheep, and 93 oxen. Only two men were reported killed in the attack, one by refusing to leave his home when warned.

In October 1778, Lieutenant Colonel William Butler led 300 Continental soldiers and New York militia attacked Brant&#x27;s home base at Onaquaga while he and his volunteers were away on a raid. The soldiers burned the houses, captured the cattle, cut down the fruit trees, and destroyed the corn crop. Butler described Onaquaga as &quot;the finest Indian town I ever saw; on both sides [of] the river there was about 40 good houses, square logs, shingles &amp; stone chimneys, good floors, glass windows.&quot; In November 1778, Brant and his volunteers joined forces with Walter Butler in an attack on Cherry Valley. Brant disliked Butler, who he found to be arrogant and patronizing, and several times threatened to quit the expedition rather than work with Butler.

With Butler was a large contingent of Seneca angered by the rebel raids on Onaquaga, Unadilla, and Tioga, and by accusations of atrocities during the Battle of Wyoming. The force rampaged through Cherry Valley, a community in which Brant knew several people. He tried to restrain the attack, but more than 30 noncombatants were reported slain in the attack. Several of the dead at Cherry Valley were Loyalists like Robert Wells who was butchered in his house with his entire family. Paxton argued that it is very unlikely that Brant would have ordered Wells killed, who was a long-standing friend of his. Patriot Americans believed that Brant had commanded the Wyoming Valley massacre of 1778, and also considered him responsible for the Cherry Valley massacre. At the time, frontier rebels called him &quot;the Monster Brant&quot;, and stories of his massacres and atrocities were widely propagated. The violence of the frontier warfare added to the rebel Americans&#x27; hatred of the Iroquois and soured relations for 50 years. While the colonists called the Indian killings &quot;massacres&quot;, they considered their own forces&#x27; widespread destruction of Indian villages and populations simply as part of the partisan war, but the Iroquois equally grieved for their losses. Long after the war, hostility to Brant remained high in the Mohawk Valley; in 1797, the governor of New York provided an armed bodyguard for Brant&#x27;s travels through the state because of threats against him.

Some historians have argued that Brant had been a force for restraint during the campaign in the Mohawk Valley. They have discovered occasions when he displayed compassion, especially towards women, children, and non-combatants. One British officer, Colonel Mason Bolton, the commander of Fort Niagara, described in a report to Sir Frederick Haldimand, described Brant as treating all prisoners he had taken &quot;with great humanity&quot;. Colonel Ichabod Alden said that he &quot;should much rather fall into the hands of Brant than either of them [Loyalists and Tories].&quot; But, Allan W. Eckert asserts that Brant pursued and killed Alden as the colonel fled to the Continental stockade during the Cherry Valley attack. Morton wrote: &quot;An American historian, Barbara Graymount, has carefully demolished most of the legend of savage atrocities attributed to the Rangers and the Iroquois and confirmed Joseph Brant&#x27;s own reputation as a generally humane and forbearing commander&quot;. Morton wrote that the picture of Brant as a mercenary fighting only for &quot;rum and blankets&quot; given to him by the British was meant to hide the fact &quot;that the Iroquois were fighting for their land&quot; as most American colonists at the time &quot;rarely admitted that the Indians had a real claim to the land&quot;. As the war went on and became increasingly unpopular in Britain, opponents of the war in Great Britain used the &quot;Monster Brant&quot; story as a way of attacking the Prime Minister, Lord North, arguing the Crown&#x27;s use of the &quot;savage&quot; Mohawk war chief was evidence of the immorality of Lord North&#x27;s policies. As Brant was a Mohawk, not British, it was easier for anti-war politicians in Britain to make him a symbol of everything that was wrong with the government of Lord North, which explains why paradoxically the &quot;Monster Brant&quot; story was popular on both sides of the Atlantic.

Lt. Col. William Stacy of the Continental Army was the highest-ranking officer captured by Brant and his allies during the Cherry Valley massacre. Several contemporary accounts tell of the Iroquois stripping Stacy and tying him to a stake, in preparation for what was ritual torture and execution of enemy warriors by Iroquois custom. Brant intervened and spared him. Some accounts say that Stacy was a Freemason and appealed to Brant on that basis, gaining his intervention for a fellow Mason. Eckert, a historian and historical novelist, speculates that the Stacy incident is &quot;more romance than fact&quot;, though he provides no documentary evidence.

During the winter of 1778–1779, Brant&#x27;s wife Susanna, died, leaving him with the responsibility of raising their two children, Issac and Christina alone. Brant chose to have children stay in Kanienkeh, deciding that a frontier fort was no place for children. For Brant, being away from his children as he went to campaign in the war was a source of much emotional hardship.

====Commissioned as officer, 1779====
In February 1779, Brant traveled to Montreal to meet with Frederick Haldimand, the military commander and Governor of Quebec. Haldimand commissioned Brant as Captain of the Northern Confederated Indians. He also promised provisions, but no pay, for his Volunteers. Assuming victory, Haldimand pledged that after the war ended, the British government would restore the Mohawk to their lands as stated before the conflict started. Those conditions were included in the Proclamation of 1763, the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, and the Quebec Act in June 1774. Haldimand gave Brant the rank of captain in the British Army as he found Brant to the most &quot;civilized&quot; of the Iroquois chiefs, finding him not to be a &quot;savage&quot;.

In May, Brant returned to Fort Niagara where, with his new salary and plunder from his raids, he acquired a farm on the Niagara River, six miles (10 km) from the fort. To work the farm and to serve the household, he used slaves captured during his raids. Brant also bought a slave, a seven-year-old African-American girl named Sophia Burthen Pooley. She served him and his family for six years before he sold her to an Englishman named Samuel Hatt for $100. He built a small chapel for the Indians who started living nearby. There he also married for a third time, to Catherine Croghan (as noted above in Marriage section).

Brant&#x27;s honors and gifts caused jealousy among rival chiefs, in particular the Seneca war chief Sayenqueraghta. A British general said that Brant &quot;would be much happier and would have more weight with the Indians, which he in some measure forfeits by their knowing that he receives pay&quot;. In late 1779, after receiving a colonel&#x27;s commission for Brant from Lord Germain, Haldimand decided to hold it without informing Brant.

Over the course of a year, Brant and his Loyalist forces had reduced much of New York and Pennsylvania to ruins, causing thousands of farmers to flee what had been one of the most productive agricultural regions on the eastern seaboard. As Brant&#x27;s activities were depriving the Continental Army of food, General George Washington ordered General John Sullivan in June 1779 to invade Kanienkeh and destroy all of the Haudenosaunee villages. In early July 1779, the British learned of plans for a major American expedition into Iroquois Seneca country. To disrupt the Americans&#x27; plans, John Butler sent Brant and his Volunteers on a quest for provisions and to gather intelligence in the upper Delaware River valley near Minisink, New York. After stopping at Onaquaga, Brant attacked and defeated American militia at the Battle of Minisink on July 22, 1779. Brant&#x27;s raid failed to disrupt the Continental Army&#x27;s plans, however.

In the Sullivan Expedition, the Continental Army sent a large force deep into Iroquois territory to attack the warriors and, as importantly, destroy their villages, crops and food stores. Brant&#x27;s Volunteers harassed, but were unable to stop Sullivan who destroyed everything in his path, burning down 40 villages and 160,000 bushels of corn. The Haudenosauee still call Washington &quot;Town Destroyer&quot; for the Sullivan expedition. As Brant looked over the devastated land of Kanienkeh he wrote in a letter to Claus: &quot;We shall begin to know what is to befal [befall] us the People of the Long House&quot;. Brant and the Iroquois were defeated on August 29, 1779, at the Battle of Newtown, the only major conflict of the expedition. Sullivan&#x27;s Continentals swept away all Iroquois resistance in New York, burned their villages, and forced the Iroquois to fall back to Fort Niagara. Brant wintered at Fort Niagara in 1779–80. To escape the Sullivan expedition, about 5,000 Senecas, Cayugas, Mohawks and Onondagas fled to Fort Niagara, where they lived in squalor, lacking shelter, food and clothing, which caused many to die over the course of the winter.

Brant pressed the British Army to provide more for his own people while at the same time finding time to marry for a third time. Brant&#x27;s third wife, Adonwentishon, was a Mohawk clan mother, a position of immense power in Haudenosauee society, and she did much to rally support for her husband. Haldimand had decided to withhold Brant the rank of colonel in the British Army that he had been promoted to, believing that such a promotion would offend other Loyalist Haudenosauee chiefs, especially Sayengaraghta, who viewed Brant as an upstart and not their best warrior, but he did give him the rank of captain. Captain Brant tried his best to feed about 450 Mohawk civilians who had been placed in his care by Johnson, which caused tensions with other British Army officers who complained that Brant was &quot;more difficult to please than any of the other chiefs&quot; as he refused to take no for an answer when he demanded food, shelter and clothing for the refugees. At one point, Brant was involved in a brawl with an Indian Department employee whom he had accused of not doing enough to feed the starving Mohawks.

====Wounded and service in Detroit area, 1780–1783====
In early 1780, Brant resumed small-scale attacks on American troops and white settlers in the Mohawk and Susquehanna river valleys. In February 1780, he and his party set out, and in April attacked Harpersfield. In mid-July 1780 Brant attacked the Oneida village of Kanonwalohale, as many of the nation fought as allies of the American colonists. Brant&#x27;s raiders destroyed the Oneida houses, horses, and crops. Some of the Oneida surrendered, but most took refuge at Fort Stanwix.

Traveling east, Brant&#x27;s forces attacked towns on both sides of the Mohawk River: Canajoharie on the south and Fort Plank. He burned his former hometown of Canajoharie because it had been re-occupied by American settlers. On the raiders&#x27; return up the valley, they divided into smaller parties, attacking Schoharie, Cherry Valley, and German Flatts. Joining with Butler&#x27;s Rangers and the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, Brant&#x27;s forces were part of a third major raid on the Mohawk Valley, where they destroyed settlers&#x27; homes and crops. In August 1780, during a raid with the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York in the Mohawk valley, about 150,000 bushels of wheat were burned. Brant was wounded in the heel at the Battle of Klock&#x27;s Field.

In April 1781, Brant was sent west to Fort Detroit to help defend against Virginian George Rogers Clark&#x27;s expedition into the Ohio Country. In August 1781, Brant soundly defeated a detachment of Clark&#x27;s force, capturing about 100 Americans and ending the American threat to Detroit. Brant&#x27;s leadership was praised by British Army officers who described him as an intelligent, charismatic and very brave commander. He was wounded in the leg and spent the winter 1781–82 at the fort. During 1781 and 1782, Brant tried to keep the disaffected western Iroquois nations loyal to the Crown before and after the British surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781.

In June 1782, Brant and his Indians went to Fort Oswego, where they helped rebuild the fort. In July 1782, he and 460 Iroquois raided forts Herkimer and Dayton, but they did not cause much serious damage. By 1782, there was not much left to destroy in New York and during the raid Brant&#x27;s forces killed 9 men and captured some cattle. Sometime during the raid, he received a letter from Governor Haldimand, announcing peace negotiations, recalling the war party and ordering a cessation of hostilities. Brant denounced the British &quot;no offensive war&quot; policy as a betrayal of the Iroquois and urged the Indians to continue the war, but they were unable to do so without British supplies.

Other events in the New World and Europe as well as changes in the British government had brought reconsideration of British national interest on the American continent. The new governments recognized their priority to get Britain out of its four interconnected wars, and time might be short. Through a long and involved process between March and the end of November 1782, the preliminary peace treaty between Great Britain and America would be made; it would become public knowledge following its approval by the Congress of the Confederation on April 15, 1783. In May 1783, a bitter Brant, when he learned about the treaty of Paris, wrote &quot;England had sold the Indians to Congress&quot;. Much to Brant&#x27;s dismay, not only did the Treaty of Paris fail to mention the Haudenosaunee, but the British negotiators took the viewpoint that the Iroquois would have to negotiate their own peace treaty with the Americans, who Brant knew were a vengeful mood against him. Like all of the Indians who fought for the Crown, Brant felt a profound sense of betrayal when he learned of the Treaty of Paris, complaining that the British diplomats in Paris did nothing for the Indian Loyalists. Nearly another year would pass before the other foreign parties to the conflict signed treaties on September 3, 1783, with that being ratified by Congress on January 14, 1784, and formally ending the American Revolutionary War.

The American Revolutionary War is known to the Haudenosaunee as &quot;the Whirlwind&quot; that led to many of them being exiled from Kanienkeh to Canada, and the decision of Joseph and Molly Brant to be loyal to the Crown as the best way of preserving the Haudenosaunee lands and way of life has been controversial, with many Hadenosaunee historians believing that neutrality would have worked better. However, Paxton noted that after the war the United States imposed treaties that forced the Tuscarora and the Oneida who fought for the United States to surrender most of their land to white settlement; which Paxton used to argue that if all Six Nations had fought for the United States or remained neutral, they still would have lost most of their land. In this context, Paxton maintained that the decision of the Brant siblings in 1775 to support the Crown, which at least promised to respect Haudenosaunee land rights was the most rational under the circumstances.

==After the war==


In ending the conflict with the Treaty of Paris (1783), Britain accepted the American demand that the boundary with British Canada should revert to its location after the Seven Years&#x27; War with France in 1763, and not the revisions of the Quebec Act as war with the colonists approached. The difference between the two lines was the whole area south of the Great Lakes, north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi, in which the Six Nations and western Indian tribes were previously accepted as sovereign. For the Americans, the area would become the Northwest Territory from which six-and-a-half new States would later emerge. While British promises of protection of the Iroquois domain had been an important factor in the Six Nations&#x27; decision to ally with the British, they were bitterly disappointed when Britain ceded it and acknowledged the territory as part of the newly formed United States. Just weeks after the final treaty signing, the American Congress on September 22, stated its vision of these Indian lands with the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783; it prohibited the extinguishment of aboriginal title in the United States without the consent of the federal government, and was derived from the policy of the British Proclamation of 1763.

Brant&#x27;s status as a successful war leader who was popular with the warriors, his relationships with various British officials and his marriage to Adonwentishon, the clan mother of the turtle clan, made him a spokesman for his people, and Brant emerged as a more powerful leader after the war than what he had been during the war. In 1783, Brant consulted with Governor Haldimand on Indian land issues and in late summer of 1783, Brant traveled west and helped initiate the formation of the Western Confederacy. In his speeches during his trip, Brant advocated pan-Indianism, saying that if First Nations peoples would only stick together then the Americans might be held at bay while allowing the Indians to play off the British against the Americans. Brant argued that if all of the Indians held together to negotiate peace with the United States, then they would obtain better terms as he argued the Indians needed to prove to the Americans that they were not &quot;conquered peoples&quot;. In August and September he was present at unity meetings in the Detroit area, and on September 7 at Lower Sandusky, Ohio, was a principal speaker at an Indian council attended by Wyandots, Lenape, Shawnees, Cherokees, Ojibwas, Ottawas, and Mingos. The Iroquois and 29 other Indian nations agreed to defend the 1768 Fort Stanwix Treaty boundary line with European settlers by denying any Indian nation the ability to cede any land without common consent of all. At same time, Brant in his talks with Haldimand was attempting to have a new homeland created for the Iroquois. Initially, the new homeland was to be the Bay of Quinte, but Brant decided he wanted the Grand river valley instead. Haldimand did not want to give the Grand river valley to the Iroquois, but with many Haudenosaunee warriors openly threatening to attack the British, whom they accused of betraying them with the Treaty of Paris, Haldimand did not want to alienate Brant, the most pro-British of the chiefs.

Brant was at Fort Stanwix from late August into September for initial peace negotiations between the Six Nations and New York State officials, but he did not attend later treaty negotiations held there with the commissioners of the Continental Congress in October. Brant expressed extreme indignation on learning that the commissioners had detained as hostages several prominent Six Nations leaders and delayed his intended trip to England attempting to secure their release. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix was signed on October 22, 1784, to serve as a peace treaty between the Americans and the Iroquois, but it forced the cession of most Iroquois land, as well as greater lands of other tribes to the west and south. Some reservations were established for the Oneida and Tuscarora, who had been allies of the American rebels.

With Brant&#x27;s urging and three days later, Haldimand proclaimed a grant of land for a Mohawk reserve on the Grand River in the western part of the Province of Quebec (present-day Ontario) on October 25, 1784. Later in the fall, at a council at Buffalo Creek, the clan matrons decided that the Six Nations should divide, with half going to the Haldimand grant and the other half staying in New York. Starting in October 1784, Brant supervised the Iroquois settlement of the Grand river valley, where some eighteen hundred people settled. At the new settlement of Brant&#x27;s Town (modern day Brantford, Ontario), Brant had the Mohawks move into two-room log houses while the center of the community was the local Anglican church, St. Paul&#x27;s. Brant built his own house at Brant&#x27;s Town which was described as &quot;a handsome two story house, built after the manner of the white people. Compared with the other houses, it may be called a palace.&quot; Brant&#x27;s home had a white fence, a Union Flag flying in front, and was described as being equipped with &quot;chinaware, fine furniture, English sheets, and a well-stocked liquor cabinet&quot;. The British historian Michael Johnson described the lifestyle of the Anglophile Brant along the Grand as &quot;something of the style of an English squire&quot;. Deeply interested in the Anglican church, Brant used his spare time to translate the Gospel of St. Mark from English into Mohawk. He had about twenty white and black servants and slaves. Brant thought the government made too much over the keeping of slaves, as captives were used for servants in Indian practice. He had a good farm of mixed crops and also kept cattle, sheep, and hogs. At one point he owned 40 black slaves.

Brant was nostalgic for Kanienkeh, and as much possible, Brant tried to recreate the world he had left behind in the Grand river valley. As part of Brant&#x27;s efforts to recreate Kanienkeh on the Grand, he tried unsuccessfully to persuade all of the Haudenosaunee who gone into exile into Canada to settle on the Grand river valley. Many of the Haudenosaunee who went into exile preferred to take up the British offer on land on the Bay of Quinte, which was further from the United States. Within the Mohawk people, the traditional division between those living in the town of Tiononderoge and those living in the town of Canajoharie persisted, with most of the Tiononderoge Mohawks preferring the Bay of Quinte to the Grand river valley. Brant did not discourage whites from settling around the Grand River valley, and at the beginning of every May, Brant hosted a reunion of Loyalist veterans from New York. At Brant&#x27;s Town, veterans of Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, the Indian Department and Butler&#x27;s Rangers would meet to remember their war services while Brant and other former officers would give speeches to the veterans amid much dancing, drinking and horse racing to go along with the reunions.

Though the Grand River valley had been given to Iroquois, Brant allowed white veterans of Brant&#x27;s Volunteers to settle on his land. The very first white settlers on the Grand were Hendrick Nelles and his family; the Huff brothers, John and Hendrick; Adam Young and his family, and John Dochsteder, all veterans of the Brant&#x27;s Volunteers, whom Brant invited to settle. Brant was to trying to recreate the &quot;human geography&quot; of Kanienkeh along the Grand as the families he allowed to settle by the Grand River had all been his neighbours in Kanienkeh before the war. Brant gave leases with an average size of 400 acres to former Loyalists along the Grand river, which became an important source of revenue for the Iroquois, as well recreating the multi-racial and multi-cultural world that Brant had grown up in. Not all the Iroquois appreciated Brant&#x27;s willingness to allow white veterans to settle in the Grand river valley with two Mohawk veterans, Aaron and Issac Hill threatening at a community meeting to kill Brant for &quot;bringing white people to settle in their lands&quot;, which ended with the Hills leaving for the Bay of Quinte. Paxton wrote that European and American writers coming from a patriarchal culture almost completely ignored the clan mothers and tended to give Iroquois headmen, orators, and &quot;sachems&quot; far more power than what they possessed, and it is easy to exaggerate Brant&#x27;s power. However, Paxton noted that way in which critics like the Hills attacked Brant as the author of certain policies &quot;suggests that Brant was no empty vessel. Rather, he had transformed his wartime alliances into a broad-based peacetime coalition capable of forwarding a specific agenda&quot;. Much to everyone&#x27;s surprise, Molly Brant did not settle at Brant&#x27;s Town, instead settling in Kingston. Molly wanted the best education for her eight children, and felt Kingston offered better schools than what were to be found in the settlement run by her brother.

In November 1785, Brant traveled to London to ask King George III for assistance in defending the Indian confederacy from attack by the Americans. The government granted Brant a generous pension and agreed to fully compensate the Mohawk for their losses, but they did not promise to support the confederacy. (In contrast to the settlement which the Mohawk received, Loyalists were compensated for only a fraction of their property losses.) The Crown promised to pay the Mohawk some £15,000 and to pay both Joseph and his sister Molly pensions for their war services. During his time in London, Brant attended masquerade balls, visited the freak shows, dined with the debauched Prince of Wales and finished the Anglican &quot;Mohawk Prayer Book&quot; that he had begun before the war. He also took a diplomatic trip to Paris, returning to Quebec City in June 1786.

Upon his return, Brant was notably more critical of the British, for instance calling the Colonial Secretary, Lord Sydney, a &quot;stupid blockhead&quot; who did not understand the Iroquois. At the same time, Brant&#x27;s relations with John Johnson declined with Johnson siding with the Hills against Brant&#x27;s land policies along the Grand river valley. In December 1786 Brant, along with leaders of the Shawnee, Lenape, Miami, Wyandot, Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi nations, met at the Wyandot village of Brownstown and renewed the wartime confederacy in the West by issuing a statement to the American government declaring the Ohio River as the boundary between them and the whites. Nevertheless, despite Brant&#x27;s efforts to produce an agreement favorable to the Brownstown confederacy and to British interests, he also would be willing to compromise later with the United States. In 1789, a trivial incident strained Brant&#x27;s relations with the British. Brant attempted to enter Fort Niagara carrying his weapons, and was told by a sentry that as an Indian, he would have to lay down his arms. An indignant Brant refused, saying that as both a Mohawk warrior chief and as a British Army officer, he would keep his weapons, and the commandant of Fort Niagara agreed that Brant would enter with his weapons. Nonetheless, the incident left a sour taste in Brant&#x27;s mouth as he noted that other officers in the British Army were not asked to remove their weapons when entering a fort. From 1790 onward, Brant had been planning on selling much of the land along the Grand river granted by the Haldimand proclamation and using the money from the sales to finance the modernization of the Haudenosaunee community to allow them equal standing with the European population.

In 1790, after Americans attacked the Western Confederacy in the Northwest Indian War sending General Josiah Harmar on a putative expedition, member tribes asked Brant and the Six Nations to enter the war on their side. Brant refused; he instead asked Lord Dorchester, the new governor of Quebec, for British assistance. Dorchester also refused, but later in 1794, he did provide the Indians with arms and provisions. After the defeat of General Harmar in 1790 at the hands of Little Turtle, the United States became interested in having Brant mediate as the War Secretary Henry Knox wrote several letters to Brant asking him to persuade Little Turtle of the Western Confederacy to lay down his arms. Harmar&#x27;s defeat proved to the U.S. government that Indians of the Northwest were not &quot;conquered peoples&quot;, and it would require a war to bring them under U.S. authority. Brant exaggerated his influence with the Western Confederacy in his letters to U.S. officials, knowing if the Americans were courting him, then the British would likewise engage in gestures to keep his loyalty. Brant was attempting to revive the traditional &quot;play-off&quot; system in order to strengthen the position of his people. However, Brant knew that the British were not willing to go to war with the United States to save the Western Confederacy, and his position was not as strong as it seemed.

As a mediator, Brant suggested to the Americans that they cease white settlement in most of the lands west of the Ohio river while advising the Western Confederacy to negotiate with the Americans, saying that after Harmar&#x27;s defeat they held the upper hand and now was the time to negotiate peace before the Americans brought more military forces into the Old Northwest. Brant also advised the Americans to negotiate with the Western Confederacy as a whole instead with the individual nations and at the same time used his talks with the Americans to impress upon the British that they needed to have respect for First Nations land rights in Upper Canada. The peoples of the Northwest had often had difficult relations with the Iroquois in the past, and were primarily interested in enlisting Brant&#x27;s aid as a way of bringing the British into the war on their side. In June 1791, Brant was publicly challenged by representatives of the Western Confederacy to &quot;take up the hatchet&quot; against the Americans, and by refusing, his influence, whatever it was, on the Western Confederacy ended forever. Though Brant had warned the Western Confederacy that they were fighting a war that they could not hope to win, in November 1791 Little Turtle inflicted a crushing defeat on the American general Arthur St. Clair, which made Brant appear both cowardly and foolish. After St. Clair&#x27;s defeat, Little Turtle sent Brant the scalp of Richard Butler, who had one of the U.S. Indian commissioners who negotiated the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, together with the message: &quot;You chief Mohawk, what are you doing? Time was when you roused us to war &amp; told us that if all the Indians would join with the King they should be a happy people &amp; become independent. In a very short time you changed your voice &amp; went to sleep &amp; left us in the lurch&quot;. It was widely noted in the Northwest that amongst the victorious warriors who defeated St. Clair were the Shawnee, Miami, Ottawa, Wyandots, Chippewas, Potawatomi, Cherokee, Mingoes and Lepnai, but none were from the Six Nations.

In 1792, the American government invited Brant to Philadelphia, then capital of the United States, where he met President George Washington and his cabinet for the first time. The Americans offered him a large pension, and a reservation in upstate New York for the Mohawks to try to lure them back. Brant refused, but Pickering said that Brant did take some cash payments. Later in 1794, Washington privately told Henry Knox to &quot;buy Captain Brant off at almost any price&quot; in order to avoid further conflict with Brant and the Mohawks. While in Philadelphia, Brant attempted a compromise peace settlement between the Western Confederacy and the Americans, but he failed. In 1793, Brant spoke at a council meeting of the Western Confederacy where he suggested that they accept the American settlements north of the Ohio river while excluding white settlement to the rest of the land west of the Ohio as the price of peace. Brant was outvoted and the assembled chiefs announced that no white settlement west of the Ohio were the only peace terms they were willing to accept. The war continued, and the Indians were defeated in 1794 at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The unity of the Western Confederacy was broken with the peace Treaty of Greenville in 1795. The defeat of the Western Confederacy led to the Americans losing interest in Brant as a mediator, causing the collapse of his attempts to play the British off against the Americans.

Brant often clashed with General John Graves Simcoe, the governor of Upper Canada. In 1791, following tensions between French-speakers and English-speakers, the province of Quebec had been divided into two new colonies, Lower Canada (modern southern Quebec) and Upper Canada (modern southern Ontario). Brant had begun selling some of the land he owned along the Grand river to British settlers with the intention of investing the profits into a trust that would make the Six Nations economically and politically independent of the British. Simcoe sabotaged Brant&#x27;s plans by announcing that the Six Nations were only allowed to sell land to the Crown, which would then resell it to white settlers. On January 14, 1793, Simcoe issued a &quot;patent&quot; to the Haldimand proclamation, which stated that the Brant&#x27;s lands did not extend to the beginning of the Grand river as the Haldimand proclamation had stated, and that the Haudenousaunee did not have the legal right to sell or lease their land to private individuals, and instead were to deal only with the Crown. Brant rejected the Simcoe patent, saying that Simcoe did not have the right to alter the Haldimand proclamation; the question of whether the Iroquois owned all the land to the beginning of the Grand river to its mouth or not is still, as of the 21st century, part of an ongoing land dispute. Simcoe justified his &quot;patent&quot; with reference to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which had forbidden white settlement west of the Ohio river while at the same time giving the Indian tribes living west of the Ohio the right to sell the land only to the Crown, which was the ultimate owner of the land with the Indians merely having the right of &quot;occupancy&quot;. Brant disregarded the Simcoe&#x27;s &quot;patent&quot; and in 1795–96 sold blocks of land along the Grand river, receiving some £85,000 sterling together with interest of £5,119 annually. Simcoe disallowed these land sales as illegal and refused to give the buyers land deeds, but he made no effort to evict the buyers, who continued to own the land.

When in the spring of 1795, Brant&#x27;s son Issac murdered an American deserter named Lowell who had settled in the Mohawk community at Grand River, Simcoe insisted that the Crown was paramount in Upper Canada and Issac Brant would have to face trial for murder in an Upper Canada court, which would try him according to English common law. Brant by contrast insisted that Six Nations were sovereign along their lands on the Grand, and his son would face justice in a traditional Mohawk trial before community elders, denying that Simcoe had the legal right to try any Mohawk. The issue of whether the Six Nations were sovereign along their lands besides the Grand River as Brant insisted or possessing a limited sovereignty subjected to the authority of the Crown as argued by Simcoe had been brought to a head by the question of whether Issac Brant was to be tried by an Upper Canada court or by Mohawk elders, and Brant&#x27;s actions were motivated than by his desire to protect his son. Simcoe threatened to call out the Upper Canada militia to take Issac Brant by force, when his father refused to turn him over, but was overruled by Lord Dorchester, who told Simcoe that the murder of one deserter from the U.S. Army was scarcely worth a war with the Six Nations, especially as Britain was at war with revolutionary France. Brant had responded to Simcoe&#x27;s threat to call out the Upper Canada militia that &quot;it would be seen who the most interest with the militia and that the Governor wold not be able to make them Act against him&quot;. Most of the white settlers along the Grand River had been given their lands by Brant and many of the men had fought with him during the Revolutionary War, and Brant believed that they would not act against him if it came to a showdown with Simcoe. In 1798, a Moravian missionary who traveled along the Grand river wrote &quot;all the settlers are in a kind of vassalage to him [Brant]&quot;.

The issue resolved itself later that year when during the distribution of presents from the Crown to the Iroquois chiefs at Head of the Lake (modern Burlington, Ontario), Issac had too much to drink in the local tavern and began to insult his father. Joseph Brant happened to be in a neighbouring room, and upon hearing what Issac was saying, marched in and ordered his son to be silent, reminding him that insulting one&#x27;s parents was a grave breach of courtesy for the Mohawk. When an intoxicated Issac continued to insult him, Joseph slapped him across the face, causing Issac to pull out his knife and take a swing at his father. In the ensuring fight, Joseph badly wounded his son by turning his own knife against him, by deflecting the blow which caused the knife to strike Issac&#x27;s head instead, and later that night Issac died of his wounds. Brant was to be haunted by the death of his son for the rest of his life, feeling much guilt over what he had done.

In 1796, Upper Canada appeared to be on the brink of war with the Mississaugas. In August 1795, a Mississauga chief named Wabakinine had arrived at Upper Canada&#x27;s capital York (modern Toronto, Ontario) with his family. A British soldier, Private Charles McCuen was invited by Wabakinine&#x27;s sister into her bed, and neither saw fit to inform Wabakinine of their planned tryst under his roof. When Wabakinine woke up to relieve himself after a night of heavy drinking, he saw an unknown naked white man with his sister, and apparently assuming he had raped her, attacked him. In the ensuring struggle, McCuen killed Wabakinine and, though charged with murder, was acquitted by a jury under the grounds of self-defense. The Mississaguas were incensed with the verdict and threatened war if McCuen was not turned over to them to face their justice, a demand the Crown refused.

Despite their differences with Brant over the land sales on the Grand, the Crown asked him for his help, and Brant visited the Mississaugas to argue for peace, persuading them to accept the verdict, reminding them that under Mississauga law self-defense was a valid excuse for killing someone, and even Wabakinine&#x27;s sister had stated the sex was consensual and she had tried to stop her brother when he attacked McCuen, screaming she had not been raped, but that he would not listen. Historically, the Haudenosaunee and Mississauga were enemies with the Six Nations, mocking the Mississauga as &quot;fish people&quot; (a reference to the Mississauga practice of covering their bodies with fish oil), and it was a sign of Brant&#x27;s charisma and charm that he was able to persuade the Mississauga not to go war with the Crown as they had been threatening. Afterwards, Brant was able to form an alliance with the Mississauga with the men of the latter taking to shaving their hair in the distinctive hairstyle of the Mohawk, popularly known as a &quot;mohawk&quot;. The governor of Upper Canada, Peter Russell, felt threatened by the pan-Indian alliance, telling the Indian Department officials to &quot;foment any existing Jealously between the Chippewas [Mississauga] &amp; the Six Nations and to prevent ... any Junction or good understanding between these two Tribes&quot;. Brant for his part complained to Russell that &quot;my sincere attachment [to Britain] has ruined the interests of my Nation&quot;.
In early 1797, Brant traveled again to Philadelphia to meet the British diplomat Robert Liston and United States government officials. In a speech to Congress, Brant assured the Americans that he would &quot;never again take up the tomahawk against the United States&quot;. At this time the British were at war with France and Spain. While in Philadelphia, Brant also met with the French diplomat Pierre August Adet where he stated: &quot;[H]e would offer his services to the French Minister Adet, and march his Mohawks to assist in effecting a revolution and overturning the British government in the province.&quot; When Brant returned home to Canada, there were fears of a French attack. Peter Russell wrote: &quot;the present alarming aspect of affairs – when we are threatened with an invasion by the French and Spaniards from the Mississippi, and the information we have received of emissaries being dispersed among the Indian tribes to incite them to take up the hatchet against the King&#x27;s subjects.&quot; He also wrote that Brant &quot;only seeks a feasible excuse for joining the French, should they invade this province&quot;. London ordered Russell to prohibit the Indians from alienating their land. With the prospects of war to appease Brant, Russell confirmed Brant&#x27;s land sales. Governor Russell wrote: &quot;The present critical situation of public affairs obliges me to refrain from taking that notice of Capt. Brant&#x27;s conduct on this occasion which it deserves&quot;.

When Brant arrived in York in June 1797 asking for Russell to confirm the land sales along the Grand, the governor asked for the opinion of the executive council of Upper Canada who told him to confirm the land sales. In July 1797 a message from London arrived from the Colonial Secretary, the Duke of Portland, forbidding Brant to sell land along the Grand. Russell offered Brant an annuity that would be equal to the land sales along the Grand, which Brant refused. In a report to London, Russell wrote that Brant &quot;had great Influence not only with his own Tribe, but with the rest of the Five Nations, and most of the neighbuoring Indians; and that he was very capable of doing much mischief&quot;. To keep Brant loyal to the Crown, Russell then struck a deal under which the Brant would transfer the land along the Grand river to the Crown, which would sell it to the white settlers with the profits going to the Six Nations. Brant then declared: &quot;[T]hey would now all fight for the King to the last drop of their blood.&quot; In September 1797, London had decided that the Indian Department was too sympathetic towards the Iroquois, and transferred authority from dealing with them to the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, Russell, a move that Brant was openly displeased with. The veterans of the Revolutionary War like John Johnson who fought alongside Brant were more sympathetic towards Brant&#x27;s efforts to maintain independence for his people, which was why London had removed them from dealing with Brant. William Claus, the new man appointed to handle Indian affairs in Upper Canada, wanted the traditional paternal relationship with the Indians as wards of the Crown. On February 5, 1798, some 380,000 acres of land along the Grand belonging to Brant was transferred to the Crown, and Brant hired a lawyer from Niagara named Alexander Stewart to manage the money from the land sale.

Brant&#x27;s efforts to make the Six Nations economically independent via land sales of his vast land-holding along the Grand River began to bear fruit, and Brant used the annuity to train the Iroquois men to work as blacksmiths, doctors, lawyers, and surveyors, and building a council house and a mill. The Crown was displeased at Brant&#x27;s efforts to make the Iroquois economically independent, preferring that the traditional patronage relationship where the Indians had to line up to receive presents from the Crown, and tried to sabotage Brant&#x27;s efforts as much as possible. At the same time, Brant was unable to meet expectations in the Haudenosaunee community about the extent of the profits from the land sales, and many openly said that Brant should have driven a harder bargain. In 1798, Brant began to build a new house at Burlington Bay, reflecting his wish to be way from the Grand River community of Brant&#x27;s Town where so many had criticized his leadership. Most notably, the Crown refused to allow Brant to make any further land sales along the Grand while five of the six buyers of the land that Brant had sold in 1795–96 had stopped payments, hoping to own the land for free while lawyers argued about the legality of the sales. Only Brant&#x27;s friend, the merchant Richard Beasley continued to make his mortgage payments on time and in full. By 1801, Brant was beleaguered with the new governor of Upper Canada, Peter Hunter, refusing to allow Brant to make any further land sales along the Grand; the expected profits from the land sale of 1798 not appearing; and most of the Haudenosaunee demanding that Brant retire. In 1802, Hunter issued a degree forbidding the Haudenosaunee from leasing their land along the Grand to white settlers while Claus used the dispute about the land sales to stir up opposition to Brant within the Haudenosaunee community. At the same time, Hunter severed the tie between Brant and the Mississauga by stopping the distribution of presents to the Mississauga when Brant demanded the Crown pay the Mississauga two shillings per acre for the land between York and Head of Lake in what is now the city of Mississauga, Ontario, arguing the Crown&#x27;s offer of two pence per acre was far below what the land was worth. As the Mississauga were short of animals to hunt and fish to catch in Lake Ontario, the loss of presents from the Crown was a painful blow and in 1802 the Mississauga removed Brant as their chief agent. In 1805, the Mississauga chiefs sold what land that is now Mississauga to the Crown for goods worth £1,000.
In late 1800 and early 1801 Brant wrote to New York Governor George Clinton to secure a large tract of land near Sandusky, Ohio, which could serve as a refuge. He planned its use for the Grand River Indians if they suffered defeat. In September 1801, Brant was reported as saying: &quot;He says he will go away, yet the Grand River Lands will [still] be in his hands, that no man shall meddle with it amongst us. He says the British Government shall not get it, but the Americans shall and will have it, the Grand River Lands, because the war is very close to break out.&quot; In January 1802, the Executive Council of Upper Canada learned of this plot, led by Aaron Burr and George Clinton, to overthrow British rule and to create a republican state to join the United States. September 1802, the planned date of invasion, passed uneventfully and the plot evaporated.

In January 1801, Brant was interviewed by an American minister, the Reverend Elkanah Holmes about the history of the Iroquois. A notable aspect of Brant&#x27;s answers about the origins of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was that refrained from any mention of the supernatural or Hiawatha, and Wathatotarho is less of a villain than other accounts have him. The American historian Douglas Boyce wrote Brant&#x27;s answers which portrayed the genesis of the Iroquois Confederacy as due to rational statesmanship on the part of the chiefs instead of the workings of magic suggested that either Brant was ignoring the supernatural aspects of the story in order to appeal to a white audience or that alternatively that white American and Canadian ethnologists, anthropologists, and historians have played up the emphasis on the supernatural in the story of the birth of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in order to depict the Haudenosaunee as a primitive and irrational people.

In 1804, Brant sent his agent and friend John Norton to London to meet lobby various British politicians to allow the Haudenosaunee to sell their land directly along the Grand, and to remind them that Brant had fought for the Crown in the American Revolutionary War. Brant&#x27;s old friend, the Duke of Northumberland, whom he had known since 1775, had after meeting Norton, raised the issue of the Haudenosaunee land dispute in the House of Lords, saying the Crown should have treated Brant better. Claus, who felt threatened by Norton&#x27;s mission, organized a meeting at Buffalo Creek of various Seneca chiefs to denounce Brant, and announced he was now removed from office. As Brant was not a chief, it was not clear from what position he was being removed from, and furthermore only clan mothers could depose a chief, so under Haudenosaunee traditions and laws, the ruling of chiefs at Buffalo Creek was not binding. Brant organized a meeting of the clan mothers living along the banks of the Grand River who affirmed their confidence in Brant to represent them. Claus had organized another meeting of the Seneca chiefs at Fort George to again denounce Brant and to claim that Norton was only a white man playing an Indian. Norton was a half-Scottish, half-Cherokee man and had been adopted by a Haunosaunee family, so under their Haudenosaunee tradition that made him an Iroquois, so the claim that Norton was really a &quot;white man&quot; was questionable. In July 1806, Brant attended a meeting at Fort George to tell Claus that only the clan mothers had the power to depose officials in the Haudenosaunee community and asked that Claus not be involved anymore in the land issue, saying he had not shown good faith. Brant was to spend the last year of his life involved in lawsuits with Claus as he sought to argue for the legal right to sell the land along the Grand.

Brant bought about from the Mississauga Indians at the head of Burlington Bay. Upper Canada&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, John Graves Simcoe, would not allow such a sale between Indians, so he bought this tract of land from the Mississauga and gave it to Brant. Around 1802, Brant moved there and built a mansion that was intended to be a half-scale version of Johnson Hall. He had a prosperous farm in the colonial style with of crops.

===Death===
Joseph Brant died in his house at the head of Lake Ontario (site of what would become the city of Burlington, Ontario) on November 24, 1807, at age 64 after a short illness. His last words, spoken to his adopted nephew John Norton, reflect his lifelong commitment to his people: &quot;Have pity on the poor Indians. If you have any influence with the great, endeavor to use it for their good.&quot;

In 1850, his remains were carried in relays on the shoulders of young men of Grand River to a tomb at His Majesty&#x27;s Chapel of the Mohawks in Brantford.

===Legacy===
Brant acted as a tireless negotiator for the Six Nations to control their land without Crown oversight or control. He used British fears of his dealings with the Americans and the French to extract concessions. His conflicts with British administrators in Canada regarding tribal land claims were exacerbated by his relations with the American leaders.

Brant was a war chief, and not a hereditary Mohawk &quot;sachem&quot;. His decisions could be and sometimes were overruled by the &quot;sachems&quot; and clan matrons. However, his natural ability, his early education, and the connections he was able to form made him one of the great leaders of his people and of his time. The Canadian historian James Paxton wrote that Brant&#x27;s willingness to embrace numerous aspects of European culture, his preference for wearing European style clothing and that he was a devoted member of the Church of England has led to Brant being criticized for not being sufficiently &quot;Indian&quot; enough. Many of his critics would prefer Brant to have been a leader like Tecumseh or Pontiac, leading his people into a brave but doomed battle with the white men. Paxton wrote this line of criticism is based on the erroneous notion of First Nations peoples being &quot;static and unchanging&quot;, and fails to understand that a people like the Mohawks could and did change over time. Paxton wrote that Brant grew up in a world where the Palatines and Scots-Irish settlers were his neighbours, and he understood that the European colonization was not going to be undone, leading him to attempt to secure the best possible future for his people by seeking an accommodation with the Europeans.

The situation of the Six Nations on the Grand River was better than that of the Iroquois who remained in New York. His lifelong mission was to help the Indian to survive the transition from one culture to another, transcending the political, social and economic challenges of one of the most volatile, dynamic periods of American history. He put his loyalty to the Six Nations before loyalty to the British. His life cannot be summed up in terms of success or failure, although he had known both. More than anything, Brant&#x27;s life was marked by frustration and struggle.

His attempt to create pan-tribal unity proved unsuccessful, though his efforts would be taken up a generation later by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh.

In more recent times, Brant&#x27;s legacy has received debate due to his use of slave labour. Once African slavery was introduced into North America by European settlers, some Iroquois, such as Brant, did own African slaves.

===Honors and memorialization===
During his lifetime, Brant was the subject of many portrait artists. Two, in particular, signify his place in American, Canadian, and British history:
* George Romney&#x27;s portrait, painted during Brant&#x27;s first trip to England in 1775–76, hangs in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.
* The Charles Willson Peale portrait was painted during his visit to Philadelphia in 1797; it hangs in the art gallery in the former Second Bank of the United States building at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia. Brant chose to dress in traditional Mohawk style for the formal portraits.
* The Joseph Brant Museum was constructed the mid-1800s on land Brant once owned. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the Brant House&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage. His first house in Burlington was demolished in 1932.
* The City of Brantford and the County of Brant, Ontario, are located on part of his land grant and named for him. The town of Brant, New York was also named for him.
* Joseph Brant Hospital in Burlington, Ontario, is named for him; it is sited on land he had owned.
* A statue of Brant (1886) is located in Victoria Square, Brantford.
* The township of Tyendinaga and the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory are named for him, by his traditional Mohawk name, in a different spelling.
* The neighbourhood of Tyandaga in Burlington was also named for him.
* Brant is one of the 14 leading Canadian military figures commemorated at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa, Ontario.
* A dormitory and one of the squadrons at the Royal Military College of Canada are named for him.

==Archaeology==
In 1984–85, crews from The University at Albany under the direction of David Guldenzopf, supervised by Dean Snow investigated the late Mohawk site at &quot;Indian Castle&quot; (&quot;Dekanohage&quot;) in Herkimer County, New York. Among the structures excavated were a house owned by Molly Brant and her brother Joseph from around 1762–1780. The cellar had foundation walls of thickness with the floor below the surface. The house was with a wooden, rather than dirt, floor, and a gable-end fireplace rather than the standard central open fire and smoke hole. The outer walls were covered by clapboards. Following the Brants&#x27; forced departure the house was occupied by a white family until it burned down sometime between 1795 and 1820. The relative luxury of the Brant house &quot;was something rather new to traditionally egalitarian Mohawk society... Joseph Brant was the first among Mohawk men who advanced themselves economically and politically outside the traditional matrilineal political system. ...in taking on this role he also took on many English symbols of success: wealth and the material display it affords. These things all help us to understand why the admiration of Brant by modern Mohawks is so grudging.&quot;

The site was designated a National Historic Landmark, the Mohawk Upper Castle Historic District, in 1993.

<text>Winfield Scott Hammond (November 17, 1863December 30, 1915) was an American politician. He was a member of the Democratic Party. He was the last governor from Minnesota to have been a member of the Minnesota Democratic Party before it merged with the Farmer-Labor Party to form the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party.

==Biography==
Hammond was born in 1863 in Southborough, Massachusetts, the son of Ellen P. (Panton) and John Washington Hammond. His mother was born in England. He served from Minnesota in the United States House of Representatives in the 60th, 61st, 62nd, and 63rd congresses from March 4, 1907, to January 6, 1915. He was the 18th Governor of Minnesota from January 5, 1915, until his death on December 30, 1915. Hammond is just one of five Minnesota Democrats to win a gubernatorial election with a Democrat in the White House. He was the second governor of Minnesota to die in office. Joseph Alfred Arner Burnquist succeeded him to the governorship to fill the vacancy left by Hammond&#x27;s death.

Minnesota&#x27;s eighteenth governor had little time to effect significant change before he died in office. Had he lived longer, perhaps Hammond would have realized his ambitious plans to reorganize state government by minimizing bureaucracy and eliminating waste to make Minnesota&#x27;s wheels turn more efficiently. Instead, his most notable legislation was the &quot;county option bill,&quot; a restriction on liquor sales that pleased prohibition advocates.

An inscription under Hammond&#x27;s bust in the capitol describes him as &quot;a scholar in politics&quot;. He earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from Dartmouth College and, upon moving to Mankato at age 21, became principal of its high school. He later studied law while he supervised schools in Watonwan County. He made his permanent home in St. James, where he practiced law and established himself as a political contender.

A staunch Democrat in a Republican community, he lost his first bid for Congress in 1892, but perseverance and bipartisan support eventually brought him a congressional seat 14 years later. He interrupted his fourth consecutive term to leave Washington and run for governor.

Hammond had been in office only eight months when he suffered ptomaine poisoning on a trip south and died of a stroke, aged 52, in Clinton, Louisiana on December 30, 1915.

<doc id="251375" wikidata="Q1201929" url="?curid=251375" title="Core competency">
<text>A core competency is a concept in management theory introduced by C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel. It can be defined as &quot;a harmonized combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace&quot; and therefore are the foundation of companies&#x27; competitiveness.

Core competencies fulfill three criteria:

# Provides potential access to a wide variety of markets. 
# Should make a significant contribution to the perceived customer benefits of the end product.
# Difficult to imitate by competitors.

For example, a company&#x27;s core competencies may include precision mechanics, fine optics, and micro-electronics. These help it build cameras, but may also be useful in making other products that require these competencies.

==Background==
A core competency results from a specific set of skills or production techniques that deliver additional value to the customer. These enable an organization to access a wide variety of markets.

In a 1990 article titled &quot;The Core Competence of the Corporation&quot;, C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel illustrated that core competencies lead to the development of core products, which can further be used to build many other products for end users. Core competencies are developed through the process of continuous improvements over the period of time rather than a single large change. To succeed in an emerging global market, it is more important and required to build core competencies rather than to do vertical integration. For example, NEC utilized its portfolio of core competencies to dominate the semiconductor, telecommunications, and consumer electronics market.

The use and understanding of the concept of core competences can be very important to enterprises. They can use core competences in order to excel at the contrivance of core products. Enterprises could also use core competences to raise the values of customers and stakeholders.

Alexander and Martin (2013) state that the competitiveness of a company is based on the ability to develop core competences. A core competence is, for example, a specialised knowledge, technique, or skill. The core capability is the management ability to develop, out of the core competences, core products and new business. Competence building is, therefore, an outcome of strategic architecture which must be enforced by top management in order to exploit its full capacity.

Importantly, according to C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel (1990) definition, core competencies are the &quot;collective learning across the corporation&quot;. They can, therefore, not be applied to the SBU (strategic business unit) and represent resource combination steered from the corporate level. Because the term &quot;core competence&quot; is often confused with &quot;something a company is particularly good at&quot;, some caution should be taken not to dilute the original meaning.

In &quot;Competing for the Future&quot;, the authors C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel show how executives can develop the industry foresight necessary to adapt to industry changes and discover ways of controlling resources that will enable the company to attain goals despite any constraints. Executives should develop a point of view on which core competencies can be built for the future to revitalize the process of new business creation. Developing an independent point of view of tomorrow&#x27;s opportunities and building capabilities that exploit them is the key to future industry leadership.

For an organization to be competitive, it needs not only tangible resources but intangible resources like core competences that are difficult and challenging to achieve. It is critical to manage and enhance the competences in response to industry changes in the future. For example, Microsoft has expertise in many IT based innovations where, for a variety of reasons, it is difficult for competitors to replicate or compete with Microsoft&#x27;s core competences.

In a race to achieve cost cutting, quality, and productivity, most executives do not spend their time developing a corporate view of the future because this exercise demands high intellectual energy and commitment. The difficult questions may challenge their own ability to view the future opportunities but an attempt to find their answers will lead towards organizational benefits.

==Core competencies and product development==
Core competencies are related to a firm&#x27;s product portfolio via core products. Prahalad and Hamel (1990) defined core competencies as the engines for the development of core products and services. Competencies are the roots of which the corporation grows, like a tree whose fruit are end products.

Core products contribute &quot;to the competitiveness of a wide range of end products. They are the physical embodiment of core competencies.&quot; Approaches for identifying product portfolios with respect to core competencies and vice versa have been developed in recent years. One approach for identifying core competencies with respect to a product portfolio has been proposed by Danilovic &amp; Leisner (2007). They use design structure matrices for mapping competencies to specific products in the product portfolio. Using their approach, clusters of competencies can be aggregated to core competencies. Bonjour &amp; Micaelli (2010) introduced a similar method for assessing how far a company has achieved its development of core competencies. More recently Hein et al. link core competencies to Christensen&#x27;s concept of capabilities, which is defined as resources, processes, and priorities. Furthermore, they present a method to evaluate different product architectures with respect to their contribution to the development of core competencies.

<doc id="251376" wikidata="Q5585059" url="?curid=251376" title="Gordon Dean (lawyer)">
<text>Gordon Evans Dean (December 28, 1905 – August 15, 1958) was a Seattle-born American lawyer and prosecutor who served as chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1950 to 1953.

==Early years==
Dean received his J.D. from the University of Southern California in 1930 and an LL.M. from Duke University Law School in 1932. In 1934, Dean joined the U.S. Department of Justice during the New Deal administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Dean served under Attorneys General Homer S. Cummings and Frank Murphy as a Criminal Division attorney and press spokesperson. He had taught at Duke Law before being hired as assistant to Brien McMahon in the Criminal Division. Dean helped draft expansions of the federal criminal law and defended them in cases argued before the United States Supreme Court. In 1940, Attorney General Robert H. Jackson made Dean the press spokesperson for the Department of Justice. After six years at Justice, Dean left to join McMahon&#x27;s law firm as partner.

After World War II military service, Dean served as press spokesperson for now Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson who was the chief prosecutor in the Nuremberg Trials. Prior to his work with the AEC, Dean was professor of criminal law at the University of Southern California (1946–1949).

==Atomic Energy Commission==
Dean was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to fill a vacancy on the Atomic Energy Commission, and he took his seat on May 24, 1949. Dean had been recommended to Truman by McMahon, who by this time had become Senator (elected in 1944), author of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, and chair of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee of Congress. 

During August 1949–January 1950 there was a heated debate within the U.S. government and scientific community over whether to proceed with an accelerated development of the hydrogen bomb, a nuclear weapon of massive and unprecedented force. Dean shared with McMahon and Truman a belief that the Soviet Union presented an immediate threat to the security of the United States, and that countering that threat with military superiority in the present was worth the costs of a longer-term arms race. Accordingly, Dean was in October 1949 one of two AEC commissioners who supported proceeding with such development, against three who opposed it. The AEC&#x27;s General Advisory Committee (GAC), chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, also opposed the H-bomb development. Dean supported the scope of the GAC report, which relied in part on moral grounds, but was not persuaded by the report itself, remarking to a scientist that the GAC members were behaving in the manner of a &quot;bunch of college professors.&quot; The debate was decided in January 1950 when President Truman ordered the development to proceed.

On July 11, 1950, Dean was announced as the new Chairman of the AEC. He was the second chairman of the commission, following David Lilienthal, and the appointment was again with McMahon&#x27;s backing. Dean assumed the post immediately. As early as 1950, Dean advocated for the appointment of a Presidential Science Advisor and science advisory task force. Dean was inherently skeptical about military requests, believing they often asked for arbitrary numbers without underlying rationales. But as Cold War tensions heightened and the Korean War raged on, Dean led a massive expansion of the United States nuclear facilities. During his tenure as Chairman the A.E.C. successfully conducted the Ivy Mike test of the first hydrogen bomb.

Dean served at the time of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&#x27;s creation in 1952, having initially opposed the creation but then after a number of months, acceding to pressure for Teller from it to go forward. Dean served for a brief period under President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well, staying until the completion of his term on June 30, 1953.

During Dean&#x27;s tenure as Chairman, McCarthyism reached its peak. Shortly after Dean left the AEC, Oppenheimer came under attack by Lewis Strauss, Teller and others for his alleged foot-dragging at Los Alamos on the hydrogen bomb project. Dean was outraged at some of the accusations and false accounts being made by Strauss and his allies about the course of hydrogen bomb development. At the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954, Dean defended Oppenheimer.

==Post-government==
Upon leaving government service, Dean joined investment bankers Lehman Brothers. He became an executive of General Dynamics in 1955. Dean also became an active board member of the Fruehauf Trailer Company in Detroit.

From 1954, Dean chaired a Council on Foreign Relations study group on nuclear weapons and U.S. foreign policy. Members of the group included Paul Nitze, Robert Bowie, David Rockefeller, and Lieutenant General James M. Gavin. Henry Kissinger joined as study group director in 1955. Dean would also join the International Security Objectives and Strategy panel of the Rockefeller Brothers&#x27; Special Studies Project in 1956.

==Death==
Dean died in a commercial aviation accident on August 15, 1958, when the Northeast Airlines Convair CV-240 he was traveling in crashed on its approach to Nantucket Airport.

<doc id="251377" wikidata="Q1332495" url="?curid=251377" title="John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford">
<text>John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford (8 September 1442 – 10 March 1513), the second son of John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, and Elizabeth Howard, a first cousin of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (2nd creation), was one of the principal Lancastrian commanders during the English Wars of the Roses.

He was the principal commander of King Henry VII&#x27;s army at the Battle of Bosworth Field, and again led Henry&#x27;s troops to victory at the Battle of Stoke Field two years later. He became one of the great men of the King&#x27;s regime.

==Early life==
John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, was born on 8 September 1442, the second son of John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford (23 April 1408 – 26 February 1462), and his wife Elizabeth Howard (c. 1410–1474), the daughter of Sir John Howard and Joan Walton.

In February 1462 the 12th Earl, his eldest son, Aubrey de Vere, and Sir Thomas Tuddenham, the 12th Earl&#x27;s former political opponent in Norfolk and now a fellow Lancastrian loyalist, were convicted of high treason before John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester, Constable of England, for plotting against King Edward IV. The 12th Earl was beheaded on Tower Hill on 26 February 1462, and buried in the church of Austin Friars in London. His son Aubrey had been beheaded on the same scaffold six days earlier.

Pursuing a conciliatory policy with Lancastrian families, King Edward allowed John de Vere to succeed his father, and on 18 January 1464 granted him licence to enter on his father&#x27;s lands. On 26 May 1465 he was created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Edward IV&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Woodville, and officiated at the ceremony as both Lord Great Chamberlain, in the absence of the then office-holder, the Earl of Warwick, and as Chamberlain to the queen. In November 1468, however, he was committed to the Tower, and confessed to plotting with the Lancastrians against the King. He was likely released before 7 January 1469, and received a general pardon on 5 April of that year. However, by early July 1469, Oxford had joined the discontented Yorkists led by his brother-in-law, the Earl of Warwick, and King Edward&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Clarence, for the Edgcote campaign. Following the loss at Losecoat Field on 12 March 1470, he fled overseas to the court of King Henry VI&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Anjou. In September 1470 he joined Warwick and Clarence in the invasion of England which restored Henry VI to the throne, and on 13 October bore the Sword of State before Henry in a procession to St Paul&#x27;s. He was appointed Lord High Constable of England, and as such on 15 October tried and condemned for high treason the same Earl of Worcester who had in 1462 condemned Oxford&#x27;s own father and brother.

In March 1471, he prevented Edward IV&#x27;s army from landing in Norfolk, and was in command of the right wing at the Battle of Barnet on 14 April of that year, defeating the forces of Lord Hastings. However, this early success in the battle turned to disaster when Oxford&#x27;s forces began pillaging. Oxford led his men back to the fight, but:

they lost their way in the fog and suddenly emerged on their own army, who mistook the Vere star for Edward&#x27;s sun in splendour, and met them with a flight of arrows. Whereupon Oxford and his men cried &quot;Treasoune! treasoune&quot; and fled.

After this defeat Oxford escaped to Scotland with 40 men, accompanied by his two brothers, George and Thomas Vere, and the Viscount Beaumont. From there he went to France, where he collected ships and engaged in privateering. Although he was not attainted after leaving England in 1471, his lands were confiscated, and his wife, Margaret, is said to have been subjected to great financial hardship. On 28 May 1473, Oxford attempted an unsuccessful landing at St Osyth in Essex. On 30 September 1473, he seized St Michael&#x27;s Mount in Cornwall, where he was besieged for some months by John Fortescue. After most of his men had deserted and he had been wounded in the face with an arrow, Oxford was eventually compelled to surrender on 15 February 1474, along with his two brothers and Beaumont.

Oxford was imprisoned at Hammes Castle near Calais, and was attainted early in 1475. At this time his mother, the 12th Earl&#x27;s widow, was forced to surrender her property to the Duke of Gloucester. In 1478 Oxford scaled the walls of Hammes and leapt into the moat, though whether this was an attempt at escape or suicide is unclear. The new king, Richard III, ordered his transfer to England on 28 October 1484, but before the transfer could be effected Oxford had escaped, having persuaded the captain of Hammes, Sir James Blount, to go with him to join the Earl of Richmond. It is said that Richmond was &quot;ravished with joy incredible&quot; at this event. Oxford immediately returned to Hammes to bring the garrison there to join Richmond.

Oxford commanded the archers and Henry&#x27;s vanguard using the formation called the Oxford Wedge, which penetrated Richard&#x27;s army in the shape of an arrow at the Battle of Bosworth, and held Richmond&#x27;s vanguard in fierce fighting in which John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk and the first cousin of Oxford&#x27;s mother, who was leading the vanguard of Richard III, was killed. To celebrate the Tudor victory at Bosworth, Oxford commissioned the building of the church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Lavenham.

==Service under Henry VII==

According to Gunn, Oxford was &#x27;immediately recognized as one of the great men of Henry VII&#x27;s regime&#x27;. His attainder was repealed, he was restored to his estates and titles, and received many appointments and grants, including appointment as Lord Admiral on 21 September, and chief steward of the Duchy of Lancaster south of Trent and Constable of the Tower of London on 22 September 1485. He was also appointed the first Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. He was sworn of the Privy Council, and recognized as Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain of England. As Lord Great Chamberlain he officiated at the coronations of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, bearing the king&#x27;s train at the coronation and setting the crown upon the king&#x27;s head at the coronation banquet. By 1486 he had been invested with the Order of the Garter. He was present at most great court occasions, and stood godfather to the king&#x27;s eldest son, Arthur, Prince of Wales, in 1486, bestowing on his godson a gift of a pair of basins with a cup of assay, all gilt.

Nor were Oxford&#x27;s fighting days over. In 1487, he commanded the vanguard at Stoke, the last battle of the Wars of the Roses; was in Picardy in 1492; and in 1497 was one of the commanders against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath. He presided as Lord High Steward at the trial of the Earl of Warwick on 21 November 1499. By 1499, Oxford&#x27;s yearly landed income had risen to £1600. He entertained the king regularly on his progresses. However, Sir Francis Bacon&#x27;s story that Henry VII imposed an enormous fine on the Earl for illegally bringing together more than the allowed number of retainers to welcome the king is likely apocryphal.

==Last years==
On the accession of King Henry VIII, Oxford continued in high favour, and officiated as Lord Great Chamberlain at the coronation. He resided at Wivenhoe and Castle Hedingham in Essex, and added to the 12th-century keep of the latter and constructed a new great hall and several towers. His jousting helm is in the Bargello in Florence. According to Gunn, he &#x27;kept an outstanding chapel choir&#x27;, and commissioned Caxton&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Four Sons of Aymon&quot; in 1489. Oxford also kept a playing company whose recorded performances span the years 1492–1499.

Oxford died on 10 March 1513 at Castle Hedingham and was buried on 24 April at Colne Priory. He had no issue by either of his two marriages, and was succeeded as Earl by his nephew, John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford, the second but only surviving son of Sir George Vere, third son of the 12th Earl, and his wife, Margaret Stafford, the daughter and heir of Sir William Stafford of Bishops Frome, Hereford.

==Marriages and family==
Oxford married firstly, Margaret Neville, the daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, by Alice, the daughter of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury. Oxford&#x27;s first wife was the sister of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the Kingmaker, making Oxford the uncle of Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence as the wife of George Plantagenet, and Anne Neville, the Duchess of Gloucester and later Queen of England after her husband, Richard, was crowned Richard III. Margaret Neville died between 20 November 1506 and 14 January 1507.

Oxford married secondly Elizabeth Scrope, the widow of his colleague William, 2nd Viscount Beaumont, and daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Scrope of Bentley, the second son of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton, by Eleanor, the daughter of Norman Washbourne of Wichenford.

They had no children. Elizabeth, Countess of Oxford, died in 1537. She mainly lived at Wivenhoe in Essex when she was not at court, and was buried there. She and her sister Mary, Lady Kingston, were members of the household of Catherine of Aragon and went to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. They were mourners at the funeral of Jane Seymour. The Countess bequeathed a gold cross containing a relic of the true Cross to John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford.

The Earl of Oxford is said to have had an illegitimate daughter, Katherine de Vere (d. after 20 June 1504), who married Sir Robert Broughton, &#x27;one of the richest non-baronial landowners in England&#x27;. Broughton appointed the 13th Earl as supervisor of his will.

Sir Robert Broughton and Katherine de Vere had two sons and a daughter:

* John Broughton (d. 24 January 1518) of Toddington, Bedfordshire, who married Anne Sapcote (d. 14 March 1559), the daughter and heir of Sir Guy Sapcote by Margaret Wolston, daughter and heir of Sir Guy Wolston, and by her had a son, John Broughton (d.1528), and two daughters, Katherine Broughton (d. 23 April 1535), who was the first wife of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham, and Anne Broughton, who married, as his second wife, by dispensation dated 24 May 1539, Sir Thomas Cheyney.
* Robert Broughton.
* Margaret Broughton, who married Henry Everard, by whom she had several children, including Elizabeth Everard, who married Sir William Clopton (d. 6 October 1568) of Liston Hall, Essex.

<doc id="251378" wikidata="Q624630" url="?curid=251378" title="Competitor analysis">
<text>Competitive analysis in marketing and strategic management is an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current and potential competitors. This analysis provides both an offensive and defensive strategic context to identify opportunities and threats. Profiling combines all of the relevant sources of competitor analysis into one framework in the support of efficient and effective strategy formulation, implementation, monitoring and adjustment. 

Competitive analysis is an essential component of corporate strategy. It is argued that most firms do not conduct this type of analysis systematically enough. Instead, many enterprises operate on what is called &quot;informal impressions, conjectures, and intuition gained through the tidbits of information about competitors every manager continually receives.&quot; As a result, traditional environmental scanning places many firms at risk of dangerous competitive blindspots due to a lack of robust competitor analysis. It is important to conduct the competitor analysis at various business stages to provide the best possible product or service for customers.

==Competitive analysis==
One common and useful technique is constructing a &quot;competitor array&quot;. The steps may include:

* Define the industry – scope and nature of the industry.
* Determine who the competitors are.
* Determine who the customers are and what benefits they expect.
* Determine the key strengths – for example price, service, convenience, inventory, etc. 
* Rank the key success factors by giving each one a weighting – The sum of all the weightings must add up to one.
* Rate each competitor on each of the key success factors.
* Multiply each cell in the matrix by the factor weighting.

Two additional columns can be added. In one column, a company can be rated on each of the key success factors (try to be objective and honest). In another column, benchmarks can be listed. They are the ideal standards of comparisons on each of the factors. They reflect the workings of a company using all the industry&#x27;s best practices.

==Competitive profiling==
The strategic rationale of competitor profiling is simple. Superior knowledge of rivals offers a legitimate source of competitive advantage. The raw material of competitive advantage consists of offering superior customer value in the firm&#x27;s chosen market. The definitive characteristic of customer value is the adjective, superior. Customer value is defined relative to rival offerings making competitor knowledge an intrinsic component of corporate strategy. Profiling facilitates this strategic objective in three important ways. First, profiling can reveal strategic weaknesses in rivals that the firm may exploit. Second, the proactive stance of competitor profiling will allow the firm to anticipate the strategic response of their rivals to the firm&#x27;s planned strategies, the strategies of other competing firms, and changes in the environment. Third, this proactive knowledge will give the firms strategic agility. Offensive strategy can be implemented more quickly in order to exploit opportunities and capitalize on strengths. Similarly, defensive strategy can be employed more deftly in order to counter the threat of rival firms from exploiting the firm&#x27;s own weaknesses.

Firms practising systematic and advanced competitor profiling may have a significant advantage. A comprehensive profiling capability is a core competence required for successful competition.

A common technique is to create detailed profiles on each of the major competitors. These profiles give an in-depth description of the competitor&#x27;s background, finances, products, markets, facilities, personnel, and strategies. This involves:

* Background
** location of offices, plants, and online presences
** history – key personalities, dates, events, and trends
** ownership, corporate governance, and organizational structure
* Financials
** P-E ratios, dividend policy, and profitability
** various financial ratios, liquidity, and cash flow
** profit growth profile; method of growth (organic or acquisitive)
* Products
** products offered, depth and breadth of product line, and product portfolio balance
** new products developed, new product success rate, and R&amp;D strengths
** brands, the strength of brand portfolio, brand loyalty and brand awareness
** patents and licenses
** quality control conformance
** reverse engineering or deformulation
* Marketing
** segments served, market shares, customer base, growth rate, and customer loyalty
** promotional mix, promotional budgets, advertising themes, ad agency used, sales force success rate, online promotional strategy
** distribution channels used (direct &amp; indirect), exclusivity agreements, alliances, and geographical coverage
** pricing, discounts, and allowances
* Facilities
** plant capacity, capacity utilization rate, age of plant, plant efficiency, capital investment
** location, shipping logistics, and product mix by plant
* Personnel
** number of employees, key employees, and skill sets
** strength of management, and management style
** compensation, benefits, and employee morale &amp; retention rates
* Corporate and marketing strategies
** objectives, mission statement, growth plans, acquisitions, and divestitures
** marketing strategies

==Media scanning==
Scanning competitor&#x27;s ads can reveal much about what that competitor believes about marketing and their target market. Changes in a competitor&#x27;s advertising message can reveal new product offerings, new production processes, a new branding strategy, a new positioning strategy, a new segmentation strategy, line extensions and contractions, problems with previous positions, insights from recent marketing or product research, a new strategic direction, a new source of sustainable competitive advantage, or value migrations within the industry. It might also indicate a new pricing strategy such as penetration, price discrimination, price skimming, product bundling, joint product pricing, discounts, or loss leaders. It may also indicate a new promotion strategy such as push, pull, balanced, short term sales generation, long term image creation, informational, comparative, affective, reminder, new creative objectives, new unique selling proposition, new creative concepts, appeals, tone, and themes, or a new advertising agency. It might also indicate a new distribution strategy, new distribution partners, more extensive distribution, more intensive distribution, a change in geographical focus, or exclusive distribution. Similar techniques can be used by observing a competitor&#x27;s search engine optimization targets and practices.

A competitor&#x27;s media strategy reveals budget allocation, segmentation and targeting strategy, and selectivity and focus. From a tactical perspective, it can also be used to help a manager implement his own media plan. By knowing the competitor&#x27;s media buy, media selection, frequency, reach, continuity, schedules, and flights, the manager can arrange their own media plan so that they do not coincide.

Other sources of corporate intelligence include trade shows, patent filings, mutual customers, annual reports, and trade associations.

Some firms hire competitor intelligence professionals to obtain this information. The Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals maintains a listing of individuals who provide these services.

==New competitors==
In addition to analysing current competitors, it is necessary to estimate future competitive threats. The most common sources of new competitors are:
*Companies competing in a related product/market
*Companies using related technologies
*Companies already targeting the target prime market segment but with unrelated products
*Companies from other geographical areas and with similar products
*New start-up companies organized by former employees and/or managers of existing companies
The entrance of new competitors is likely when:
*There are high profit margins in the industry
*There is unmet demand (insufficient supply) in the industry
*There are no major barriers to entry
*There is future growth potential
*Competitive rivalry is not intense
*Gaining a competitive advantage over existing firms is feasible
*Dissatisfaction with the existing suppliers

<text>Claudio Abbado (; 26 June 1933 – 20 January 2014) was an Italian conductor who was one of the leading conductors of his generation. He served as music director of the La Scala opera house in Milan, principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, music director of the Vienna State Opera, founder and director of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, founder and director of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, founding artistic director of the Orchestra Mozart and music director of the European Union Youth Orchestra.

==Biography==
=== Early life and background===
The Abbado family for several generations enjoyed both wealth and respect in their community. Abbado&#x27;s great-grandfather tarnished the family&#x27;s reputation by gambling away the family fortune. His son, Abbado&#x27;s grandfather, became a professor at the University of Turin. He re-established the family&#x27;s reputation and also showed talent as an amateur musician.

Born in Milan, Italy on 26 June 1933, Claudio Abbado was the son of violinist Michelangelo Abbado, and the brother of the musician Marcello Abbado (born 1926). His father, a professional violinist and a professor at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory, was his first piano teacher. His mother, Maria Carmela Savagnone, also was an adept pianist. Marcello Abbado later became a concert pianist, composer, and teacher at the Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro. His sister also exhibited talent in music but did not pursue a musical career after her marriage. His other brother later became a successful architect.

Abbado&#x27;s childhood encompassed the Nazi occupation of Milan. During that time, Abbado&#x27;s mother spent time in prison for harbouring a Jewish child. This period solidified his anti-fascist political sentiments. Claudio himself is known for having a famous anecdote about how when he was just eleven years old he wrote &quot;Viva Bartók&quot; on a local wall which caught the attention of the Gestapo and sent them on the hunt for the culprit. His passionate opposition to fascism continued into his adult years.

During his youth his musical interest developed, attending performances at La Scala as well as orchestral rehearsals in Milan led by such conductors as Arturo Toscanini and Wilhelm Furtwängler. He later recalled how he hated seeing Toscanini in rehearsal. Other conductors who influenced him were Bruno Walter, Josef Krips and Herbert von Karajan. It was upon hearing Antonio Guarnieri&#x27;s conducting of Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot; that Abbado resolved to become a conductor himself. At age 15, Abbado first met Leonard Bernstein when Bernstein was conducting a performance featuring Abbado&#x27;s father as a soloist. Bernstein commented, &quot;You have the eye to be a conductor.&quot;

===Education and early engagements===

Abbado studied piano, composition, and conducting at the Milan Conservatory, and graduated with a degree in piano in 1955. The following year, he studied conducting with Hans Swarowsky at the Vienna Academy of Music, on the recommendation of Zubin Mehta. Abbado and Mehta both joined the academy chorus to be able to watch such conductors as Bruno Walter and Herbert von Karajan in rehearsal. He also spent time at the Chigiana Academy in Siena.

In 1958, Abbado made his conducting debut in Trieste. That summer, he won the international Serge Koussevitzky Competition for conductors at the Tanglewood Music Festival, which resulted in a number of operatic conducting engagements in Italy. In 1959, he conducted his first opera, &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;, in Trieste. He made his La Scala conducting debut in 1960. In 1963, he won the Dimitri Mitropoulos Prize for conductors, which allowed him to work for five months with the New York Philharmonic as an assistant conductor to Bernstein. Abbado made his New York Philharmonic professional conducting debut on 7 April 1963. A 1965 appearance at the RIAS Festival in Berlin led to an invitation from Herbert von Karajan to the Salzburg Festival the following year to work with the Vienna Philharmonic. In 1965, Abbado made his British debut with the Hallé Orchestra, followed in 1966 by his London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) debut.

Abbado taught chamber music for three years during the early 1960s in Parma.

===Conducting career===
In 1969, Abbado became the principal conductor at La Scala. Subsequently, he became the company&#x27;s music director in 1972. He took the title of joint artistic director, along with Giorgio Strehler and Carlo Maria Badini, in 1976. During his tenure, he extended the opera season to four months, and focused on giving inexpensive performances for the working class and students. In addition to the standard opera repertoire, he presented contemporary operas, including works of Luigi Dallapiccola and of Luigi Nono, in particular, the world premiere of Nono&#x27;s &quot;Al gran sole carico d&#x27;amore&quot;. In 1976, he brought the La Scala company to the US for its American debut in Washington, D.C. for the American Bicentennial. In 1982, he founded the Filarmonica della Scala for the performance of orchestral repertoire by the house orchestra in concert. Abbado remained affiliated with La Scala until 1986.

On 7 October 1968, Abbado made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera with &quot;Don Carlo&quot;. He began to work more extensively with the Vienna Philharmonic (VPO) after 1971, which included two engagements as conductor of the orchestra&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day concert, in 1988 and 1991. He was a recipient of both the Philharmonic Ring and the Golden Nicolai Medal from the Vienna Philharmonic.

He served as Principal Guest Conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) from 1975 to 1979 and became its Principal Conductor in 1979, a post he held until 1987. (He was also the LSO&#x27;s Music Director from 1984 until the end of his principal conductor tenure.) From 1982 to 1985, he was principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO). In 1986, Abbado became the &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; (GMD) of the city of Vienna, and in parallel, was music director of the Vienna State Opera from 1986 to 1991. During his tenure as GMD in Vienna, in 1988, he founded the music festival Wien Modern. There he backed numerous contemporary composers including György Ligeti, Pierre Boulez, and Luigi Nono.

====Berlin Philharmonic====

Abbado first conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in December 1966. In the late 1980s it was suspected that he might become music director of the New York Philharmonic. However, after appearances as a guest conductor, in 1989, the Berlin Philharmonic elected him as its chief conductor and artistic director, in succession to Herbert von Karajan. During his Berlin tenure, Abbado oversaw an increased presence of contemporary music in the orchestra&#x27;s programming, in contrast to Karajan who had focused on late Romantic works. In 1992, he co-founded &#x27;Berlin Encounters&#x27;, a chamber music festival. In 1994, he became artistic director of the Salzburg Easter Festival. In 1998, he announced his departure from the Berlin Philharmonic after the expiration of his contract in 2002. Before his departure, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2000, which led to his cancellation of a number of engagements with the orchestra. Subsequent medical treatment led to the removal of a portion of his digestive system, and he cancelled his conducting activities for 3 months in 2001.

In 2004, Abbado returned to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic for the first time since his departure as chief conductor, for concerts of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 recorded live for commercial release. The resulting CD won Best Orchestral Recording and Record of the Year in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 awards. The Orchestra Academy of the Berlin Philharmonic established the &quot;Claudio Abbado Kompositionspreis&quot; (Claudio Abbado Composition Prize) in his honour, which has since been awarded in 2006, 2010 and 2014.

====Other orchestras and post-Berlin work====
In addition to his work with long-established ensembles, Abbado founded a number of new orchestras with younger musicians at their core. These included the European Community Youth Orchestra (later the European Union Youth Orchestra (EUYO)), in 1978, and the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester (GMJO; Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra) in (1988). In both instances, musicians from the respective youth orchestras founded spinoff orchestras, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe (COE) and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, respectively. Abbado worked with both these ensembles regularly as well and was artistic advisor to the COE, though he did not hold a formal title with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. In turn, the Mahler Chamber Orchestra formed the core of the newest incarnation of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, which Abbado and Michael Haefliger of the Lucerne Festival established in the early 2000s, and which featured musicians from various orchestras with which Abbado had long-standing artistic relationships. From 2004 until his death, Abbado was the musical and artistic director of the Orchestra Mozart, Bologna, Italy. In addition to his work with the EUYO and the GMJO, Abbado worked with the Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar of Venezuela.

===Death===

Abbado died from stomach cancer in Bologna on 20 January 2014 at the age of 80. One week later, in tribute to him, the orchestra &quot;Filarmonica della Scala&quot;, conducted by Daniel Barenboim, performed the slow movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 (Marcia funebre: Adagio assai in C minor) to an empty theatre, with the performance relayed to a crowd in the square in front of the opera house and live-streamed via La Scala&#x27;s website.

Abbado&#x27;s mortal remains were cremated and an urn with a part of his ashes was buried at the cemetery of the 15th-century chapel of Fex-Crasta in the Val Fex. It is a part of the municipality of Sils-Maria, a village in the Swiss canton of Graubünden where Abbado had a vacation home.

His musical estate was transferred to the Berlin State Library where it is being catalogued and digitised.

==Personal life==
From his first marriage in 1956 to singer Giovanna Cavazzoni, Abbado had two children: Daniele Abbado (born 1958), who became an opera director and Alessandra (born 1959). His first marriage was dissolved. From his second marriage, to Gabriella Cantalupi, Abbado had a son, Sebastiano. His four-year relationship with Viktoria Mullova resulted in Mullova&#x27;s first child, a son, the jazz bassist, Misha Mullov-Abbado. Abbado&#x27;s nephew, the son of his brother, Marcello, is the conductor Roberto Abbado.

==Conducting==
===Repertoire===
Amongst a wide range of Romantic works which he recorded and performed, Abbado had a particular affinity with the music of Gustav Mahler, whose symphonies he recorded several times. Despite this, he never managed to complete a cycle with a single orchestra: in a mix of studio and concert releases, he recorded Symphonies 1–2 and 5–7 in Chicago, Symphonies 2–4, 9 and the Adagio from 10 in Vienna, Symphonies 1 and 3–9 in Berlin, and Symphonies 1–7 and 9 in Lucerne. A planned Eighth in Lucerne (the intended culmination of his traversal of the symphonies there) had to be cancelled owing to his ill health. The symphony was finally performed and recorded in 2016 under Riccardo Chailly as a tribute to Abbado. A further Tenth Adagio recorded live in Berlin in 2011 was issued as part of a Berliner Philharmoniker Mahler set in 2020.

He was also noted for his interpretations of modern works by composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Giacomo Manzoni, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, György Ligeti, Giovanni Sollima, Roberto Carnevale, Franco Donatoni and George Benjamin.

===Musical style===
Abbado tended to speak very little in rehearsal, sometimes using the simple request to orchestras to &quot;Listen&quot;. This was a reflection of his preference for communication as a conductor via physical gesture and the eyes, and his perception that orchestras did not like conductors who spoke a great deal in rehearsal. Clive Gillinson characterised Abbado&#x27;s style as follows:

&quot;...he basically doesn&#x27;t say anything in rehearsals, and speaks so quietly, because he&#x27;s so shy, so people can get bored. But it works because everyone knows the performances are so great. I&#x27;ve never known anybody more compelling. He&#x27;s the most natural conductor in the world. Some conductors need to verbally articulate what they want through words, but Claudio just shows it, just does it.&quot;

In performance, Abbado often conducted from memory, as he himself noted:

&quot;...it is indispensable to know the score perfectly and be familiar with the life, the works and the entire era of the composer. I feel more secure without a score. Communication with the orchestra is easier.&quot;

===Recordings===
Abbado recorded extensively for a variety of labels, including Decca, Deutsche Grammophon, Columbia (later Sony Classical), and EMI. He conducted many opera recordings which received various awards. Among these were the Diapason Award in 1966 and 1967; also in 1967 he received the Grand Prix du Disque. In 1968 he was presented with the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis and also the Dutch Edison Award. In 1973, the Vienna Mozart Society awarded him the Mozart Medal. Abbado received the 1997 Grammy Award in the Best Small Ensemble Performance (with or without conductor) category for &quot;Hindemith: Kammermusik No. 1 With Finale 1921, Op. 24 No. 1&quot; and the 2005 Grammy Award in the Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with Orchestra) category for &quot;Beethoven: Piano Concertos Nos. 2 &amp; 3&quot; performed by Martha Argerich.

In 2012, Abbado was voted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame that April, and in May, he received the conductor prize at the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards.
