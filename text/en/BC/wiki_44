<text>Yellow Dog Linux (YDL) is a discontinued free and open-source operating system for high-performance computing on multi-core processor computer architectures, focusing on GPU systems and computers using the POWER7 processor. The original developer was Terra Soft Solutions, which was acquired by Fixstars in October 2008. Yellow Dog Linux was first released in the spring of 1999 for Apple Macintosh PowerPC-based computers. The last version, Yellow Dog Linux 7, was released on August 6, 2012. Yellow Dog Linux lent its name to the popular YUM Linux software updater, derived from YDL&#x27;s YUP (Yellowdog UPdater) and thus called Yellowdog Updater, Modified.

==Features==

Yellow Dog Linux is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS and relies on the RPM Package Manager. Its software includes applications such as Ekiga (a voice-over-IP and videoconferencing application), GIMP (a raster graphics editor), Gnash (a free Adobe Flash player), gThumb (an image viewer), the Mozilla Firefox Web browser, the Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail and news client, the OpenOffice.org productivity suite, Pidgin (an instant messaging and IRC client), the Rhythmbox music player, and the KDE Noatun and Totem media players.

Starting with YDL version 5.0 &#x27;Phoenix&#x27;, Enlightenment is the Yellow Dog Linux default desktop environment, although GNOME and KDE are also included.

Like other Linux distributions, Yellow Dog Linux supports software development with GCC (compiled with support for C, C++, Java, and Fortran), the GNU C Library, GDB, GLib, the GTK+ toolkit, Python, the Qt toolkit, Ruby and Tcl. Standard text editors such as Vim and Emacs are complemented with IDEs such as Eclipse and KDevelop, as well as by graphical debuggers such as KDbg. Standard document preparation tools such as TeX and LaTeX are also included.

Yellow Dog Linux includes software for running a Web server (such as Apache/httpd, Perl, and PHP), database server (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL), and network server (NFS and Webmin). Additional software is also included for running an enterprise server or a compute server or cluster, although two separate products from Terra Soft Solutions, called Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux (for enterprise servers) and Y-HPC (for compute servers/clusters), were specifically targeted toward those applications.

Although several other Linux distributions support the Power ISA, Yellow Dog Linux was distinguished for its focus on supporting the Apple Macintosh platform before the Mac transition to Intel processors. Before this transition, Terra Soft Solutions held the unique distinction of being the only company licensed by Apple to resell Apple computers with Linux pre-installed (or for that matter, with any operating system other than Mac OS X). Full support for AirPort (Apple&#x27;s implementation of the IEEE 802.11b-1999 wireless networking standard), and partial support for AirPort Extreme, are also built into Yellow Dog Linux, as are support for Bluetooth and support for accessing the Internet over cellular phones.

Following the Mac transition to Intel processors, Yellow Dog Linux retargeted Fedora Core 5.0 and later to support the Sony PlayStation 3 and IBM pSeries platforms extensively, while retaining its longstanding support for PowerPC-based Apple hardware.
==Distribution==
Yellow Dog Linux was sold by Terra Soft Solutions (later Fixstars), who also marketed PlayStation 3 consoles, IBM workstations, and servers with Yellow Dog Linux pre-installed. As is the case with most other Linux distribution vendors, a portion of the revenue from the sale of those boxed distributions went toward development of the operating system and applications, which are made available as source code under various free and open-source licenses.

==Notable implementations==
Gaurav Khanna, a professor in the Physics Department at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, built a message-passing based cluster using YDL and 16 PlayStation 3s. This cluster was the first such to generate published scientific results. Dubbed the &quot;PS3 Gravity Grid&quot;, it performs astrophysical simulations of large supermassive black holes capturing smaller compact objects. Khanna claimed that the cluster&#x27;s performance exceeds that of a 100+ Intel Xeon core based traditional Linux cluster on his simulations. The PS3 Gravity Grid received media coverage between 2007 and 2010.

<doc id="246711" wikidata="Q2670835" url="?curid=246711" title="Panavia Tornado ADV">
<text>The Panavia Tornado Air Defence Variant (ADV) is a long-range, twin-engine swing-wing interceptor aircraft developed by the European Panavia Aircraft GmbH consortium. It was a specialised derivative of the multirole Panavia Tornado.

Development of the Tornado ADV formally commenced in 1976. It was primarily intended to intercept Soviet bombers as they were traversing across the North Sea with the aim of preventing a successful air-launched nuclear attack against the United Kingdom. In this capacity, it was equipped with a powerful radar and beyond-visual-range missiles. Having been based on the multinational Tornado IDS, development was relatively quick. Originally, the programme was solely pursued by the United Kingdom. The first prototype performed its maiden flight on 27 October 1979; two further prototypes followed in the year after. The initial production model, the &quot;Tornado F2&quot;, entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1986.

The Tornado F2, which was only produced in small numbers, lacked key features such as radar, due to development issues. Accordingly, it was quickly followed by the Tornado F3, which was introduced in 1989. Featuring optimised RB.199 Mk 104 engines, an expanded missile capacity, and automatic wing sweep control system amongst other improvements, the Tornado F-3 became the definitive variant operated by the RAF. It was also operated by the Italian Air Force (AMI) and the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF). The AMI leased the type during the 2000s as an interim aircraft while awaiting delivery of multirole Eurofighter Typhoon fighters. During its service life, the Tornado ADV received several upgrades which enhanced its aerial capabilities and enabled it to perform Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions in addition to its interceptor duties. Ultimately, both the RAF and RSAF retired their Tornado ADV fleets in the early 2010s; the type has been replaced in both services by the Eurofighter Typhoon.

==Design and development==

===Background===
The origins of the Tornado ADV can be traced back to the issuing of RAF Air Staff Requirement 395 (ASR.395), which called for a long-range interceptor to replace both the English Electric Lightning F6 and McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 then in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). The necessity to procure a modern interceptor was primarily driven by the threat posed by the sizable strategic bomber fleet then being operated by the Soviet Union, in particular the Tupolev Tu-22M, a recently introduced supersonic bomber. Even at the onset of development on what would become the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) in 1968, the possibility of a variant dedicated to air defence had been quietly considered. While several American aircraft had been evaluated for meeting this requirement, they were all determined to be unsuitable.

Despite Britain&#x27;s strong interest in the air defence concept, it proved to be unattractive to the other European partners on the Tornado project, leading to its development being pursued solely by the United Kingdom. On 4 March 1976, the development of the Tornado ADV was approved and it was announced that 165 of the 385 Tornados that were on order for the RAF would be of the air defence variant. In 1976, the British Aircraft Corporation was contracted to provide three prototype aircraft.
On 9 August 1979, the first prototype was rolled out at Warton; it performed its maiden flight on 27 October 1979, piloted by David Eagles. The second and third development aircraft made their first flights on 18 July and 18 November 1980 respectively. The third prototype was primarily used in the testing of the new Marconi/Ferranti AI.24 Foxhunter aircraft interception radar. During flight testing, the Tornado ADV demonstrated its noticeably superior supersonic acceleration to the Tornado IDS, even while carrying a full weapons loadout. The test programme was greatly aided by the use of real-time telemetry, which broadcast live data from in-flight aircraft back to technicians on the ground.

The Tornado ADV&#x27;s differences compared to the Tornado IDS include a greater sweep angle on the wing gloves, and the deletion of their Krueger flap, deletion of the port cannon, a longer radome for the Foxhunter radar, slightly longer airbrakes, and the fuselage being lengthened by 1.36 m; the latter change permitted the carriage of four Skyflash semi-active radar homing missiles. This stretch was achieved by altering the Tornado&#x27;s forward fuselage, which was built in the UK, via the addition of a plug immediately behind the cockpit, which had the unexpected benefit of reducing drag and making space for an additional fuel tank (Tank &#x27;0&#x27;) carrying of fuel. The artificial feel of the flight controls was lighter on the Tornado ADV than on the IDS. Various other differences were present amongst the aircraft&#x27;s avionics, displays, guidance systems and software packages.

The Tornado F2 was the initial version of the Tornado ADV in RAF service, a total of 18 aircraft were built. Making its first flight on 5 March 1984, it was powered by the same RB.199 Mk 103 engines used by the IDS Tornado, capable of four wing sweep settings, and fitted to carry only two underwing Sidewinder missiles. Serious problems were discovered with the Foxhunter radar, which meant that the aircraft were delivered with concrete or lead ballast installed in the nose as an interim measure until they could be fitted with the radar sets. The ballast was nicknamed &quot;Blue Circle&quot;, which was a play on the Rainbow Codes nomenclature, and a British brand of cement called Blue Circle.

===Tornado F3===

Quantity production of the Tornado ADV started in 1980 and continued through to 1993. On 20 November 1985, the Tornado F3 made its maiden flight. Enhancements over the Tornado F2 included RB.199 Mk 104 engines, which were optimised for high-altitude use with longer afterburner nozzles, the capacity to carry four underwing Sidewinder missiles rather than two, and automatic wing sweep control. Upon its entrance into service, the principal armament of the Tornado F3 was the short-range Sidewinder and the medium-range Skyflash missiles, the latter being a British design derived from the American AIM-7 Sparrow.

Perhaps the most prominent of the innovations incorporated into the Tornado F3 was an automatic manoeuvre device system that enabled the flight control computer to automatically adjust the level of wing sweep to maintain optimum flight characteristics. This function was similar in concept to the automatic sweeping wing (ASW) capability of the American Grumman F-14 Tomcat, a capability that greatly enhanced manoeuvrability, but was not present on any previous Tornado IDS and ADV models. During 1989, the Tornado F.3 (originally F.Mk3) was declared operational.

===Capability Sustainment Programme===
In order to maintain the Tornado F3 as an effective platform up to its planned phasing out date of 2010, the Ministry of Defence initiated the &quot;Capability Sustainment Programme&quot; (CSP). This £125 million project, announced on 5 March 1996, involved many elements, including the integration of the ASRAAM and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, and radar upgrades to improve multi-target engagement. Additionally, it entailed improvement in pilot and navigator displays, along with the replacement of several of the onboard computer systems. The CSP saw the removal of a non-standard state of aircraft; various upgrades, in particular to the Foxhunter radar, had led to a situation described as &quot;fleets within fleets&quot;. The Foxhunter radar caused difficulties in the upgrade programme, in particular the integration of the new AMRAAM missile.

Cost-saving decisions meant that the CSP did not fully exploit the capabilities of either the AMRAAM or ASRAAM missiles. AMRAAM typically uses two mid-course updates after launch to refresh target information prior to its own seeker taking over; however, the CSP did not include the necessary datalink to provide this capability. The ASRAAM was not fully integrated, which prevented the full off-boresight capability of the missile being used. However, in June 2001, the MoD signed a contract for a further upgrade to allow for these midcourse updates. This upgrade, together with updated IFF, was known as the AMRAAM Optimisation Programme (AOP) and was incorporated in the remaining F3 fleet between December 2003 and September 2006.

A further upgrade, disclosed in early 2003, was the integration of the ALARM anti-radiation missile to enable several Tornado ADVs to conduct Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. The F3&#x27;s existing radar warning receivers formed the basis of an Emission Location System (ELS), which can be employed to detect and locate operational radar systems in the aircraft&#x27;s vicinity, while two ALARM missiles could be carried on pylons under the fuselage. Twelve aircraft, sometimes known by the unofficial designation Tornado EF3, were converted under an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) as part of the build up to Operation Telic, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and operated by No. 11 Squadron RAF.

===Performance===

According to aviation historian Michael Leek, from the onset of the type&#x27;s development, the Tornado ADV encountered &quot;...controversy and many questions over the ADV&#x27;s performance and suitability - controversy which stayed with the aircraft for much of its service life&quot;.

The Tornado ADV was designed to serve in the role of an interceptor against the threat of Soviet bombers, rather than as an air superiority fighter for engaging in prolonged air combat manoeuvering with various types of enemy fighters. In order to perform its anti-bomber primary mission, it was equipped with long range beyond visual range missiles such as the Skyflash, and later the AMRAAM; the aircraft also had the ability to stay aloft for long periods and remain over the North Sea and Northern Atlantic in order to maintain its airborne patrol.

The capability of its weapon systems was a dramatic improvement over its predecessors. Compared with the Phantom, the Tornado had greater acceleration, twice the range and loiter time, and was more capable of operating from short &#x27;austere&#x27; air strips. Older aircraft were reliant on a network of ground-based radar stations, but the F3&#x27;s Foxhunter radar was capable of performing much longer and wider scans of surrounding airspace; the Tornado could track and engage targets at far greater distances. The Tornado also had the ability to share its radar and targeting information with other aircraft via JTIDS/Link 16 and was one of the first aircraft to have a digital data bus, used for the transmission of data between onboard computers.

==Operational history==

===Royal Air Force===

On 5 November 1984, the first interim Tornado F2 was first delivered to the RAF. These aircraft were primarily for training by No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit RAF. From July 1986, the F2&#x27;s short career came to an end as they were replaced as the improved Tornado F3 entered service; the interim aircraft were promptly placed into storage. Originally, the Tornado F2s were intended to be updated to Tornado F2A standard (similar to the F3, but without the engine upgrade) however, only the one F2A, the &quot;Tornado Integrated Avionics Research Aircraft&quot; (TIARA) was ever converted, having been customised by QinetiQ for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trials at MoD Boscombe Down.

In November 1987, No. 29 (Fighter) Squadron became the first RAF squadron to be declared operational with the Tornado ADV. The combat debut of the Tornado F3 was made in the 1991 Gulf War; a total of 18 aircraft were deployed to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia in support of coalition forces. In order to best prepare these aircraft for active combat, they were progressively upgraded under a crash programme with improved radar, enhanced engines, superior defensive countermeasures, and multiple adaptions to the weapons systems that improved combat performance in the Iraqi theatre.

Several shortcomings with the Tornado F3 were still present during the Gulf War, such as the lack of modern IFF and secure communications equipment. Partially due to this, they largely performed patrols further back from Iraqi airspace where encounters with enemy aircraft were less likely; no Tornado F3s engaged enemy aircraft. From August 1990 to March 1991, the RAF&#x27;s F3 detachment flew more than 2,000 combat air patrol sorties. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, the RAF maintained a small squadron of F3s in Saudi Arabia to continue routine patrols of Iraqi no-fly zones.
The 1990s saw multiple occasions in which the Tornado F3 engaged in active combat. Between 1993 and 1995, several were used to escort NATO aircraft engaged in Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia; in 1999, the type conducted combat air patrols during Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia. During these extended overseas deployments, the Tornado F3 reportedly proved troublesome to maintain at operational readiness while based outside the UK. Following lengthy delays in the Eurofighter programme to develop a successor to the F3 interceptor, the RAF initiated a major upgrade program in the late 1990s to enhance the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities, primarily by integrating several newer air-to-air missiles.

During 2003, the Tornado F3 was one of the assets used in Operation Telic, Britain&#x27;s contribution to the Iraq War. An expeditionary force composed of No. 43 (F) and No. 111 (F) Squadrons (known as Leuchars Fighter Wing), and No. 11 Squadron RAF and No. 25 Squadron RAF (known as Leeming Fighter Wing), was deployed to the region to carry out offensive counter-air operations. The Tornado F3&#x27;s of Leuchars Fighter Wing operated all over Iraq, including missions over and around Baghdad, throughout Operation Telic. Due to a lack of airborne threats materialising in the theatre, the F3s were withdrawn and returned to European bases that same year.

As part of the &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot; White Paper, on 21 July 2004, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the number of Tornado F3 squadrons by one to three squadrons. This represented 16 aircraft and was the first stage in the transition to the F3&#x27;s replacement, the Eurofighter Typhoon, which entered operational service with the RAF in 2005. In April 2009, it was announced that the Tornado F3 force would be reduced to one squadron of 12 aircraft in September 2009. The last operational Tornado F3s in RAF service were retired when No. 111 (F) Squadron, located at RAF Leuchars, was disbanded on 22 March 2011.
In addition to the RAF&#x27;s Tornado F3s, in 2007, QinetiQ leased four Tornado F3s from the MOD for the purpose of conducting weapons testing activities. QinetiQ&#x27;s force of four F3s remained flying beyond the RAF&#x27;s retirement of the type, in their latter service they were being used for aerial testing of the new MBDA Meteor air-to-air missile, and thus were the only flying examples in the UK for a time. Their final mission was flown on 20 June 2012, and the last three flown to RAF Leeming for scrapping on 9 July 2012.

===Italian Air Force===

In the early 1990s, the Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare Italiana&quot;, or AMI) identified a requirement for a fighter to boost its air defence capabilities pending introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon, expected around 2000. These fighters were to operate alongside the service&#x27;s obsolescent F-104ASA Starfighters. The Tornado ADV was selected from, amongst others, the F-16. On 17 November 1993, Italy signed an agreement with the RAF to lease 24 Tornado F3s from the RAF for a period of ten years. The lease included 96 Sky Flash TEMP missiles (a lower standard than the version in RAF service), training, logistical supply for ADV-specific equipment and access to the RAF facility at Saint Athan.

During March 1995, the training of the first AMI pilots commenced at RAF Coningsby while technicians gained experience at RAF Cottesmore and Coningsby. On 5 July 1995, the first aircraft was accepted by the AMI and was flown to its Italian base the same day. Delivery of the first batch was completed by the end of year; these aircraft were deployed at Gioia del Colle in Southern Italy. The second batch was delivered between February and July 1997, these aircraft were of a slightly higher specification. In early 1997, the AMI announced that it was cancelling a series of scheduled upgrades to its Tornado fleet, stating that it was placing priority for funding on the in-development Eurofighter instead.

The Tornado proved to be fairly unreliable in Italian service, reportedly achieving serviceability rates of 50% or less. &quot;Air Forces Monthly this&quot; attributed the poor performance to the AMI having underestimated the different support requirements of the aircraft versus the Tornado IDS, a lack of spare engines (which were not included in the lease agreement), and a lack of equipment.

During 2000, amid considerable delays in the Eurofighter programme, the AMI started its search for another interim fighter. While the Tornado ADV was a candidate once again, any long term extension to the lease arrangement would have involved the associated aircraft to be upgraded to RAF CSP standard along with structural modifications to extend the airframes&#x27; service life, officials considered such commitments to not be cost effective. In February 2001, Italy announced it was set to lease 35 F-16s from the United States as its new interim fighter. Accordingly, the AMI returned its Tornados to the RAF; the final aircraft arrived at RAF Saint Athan on 7 December 2004. A single aircraft was retained by the Italian Air Force for static display purposes.

===Royal Saudi Air Force===
On 26 September 1985, Saudi Arabia and Britain signed a memorandum of understanding towards what would be widely known as the Al-Yamamah arms deal, for the provision of various military equipment and services. The September 1985 deal involved the purchase of a large number of Tornado aircraft; including the Tornado ADV variant, along with armaments, radar equipment, spare parts and a pilot-training programme for the inbound fleet, in exchange for providing 600,000 barrels of oil per day over the course of several years. The first Al-Yamamah agreement ordered 24 Tornado ADVs and 48 Tornado IDSs. The RSAF received its first ADV on 9 February 1989.

U.S. analyst Anthony Cordesman commented that &quot;the Tornado ADV did not prove to be a successful air defence fighter... The RSAF&#x27;s experience with the first eight Tornado ADVs was negative&quot;. In 1990, the RSAF signed several agreements with the US to later receive deliveries of the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle, and thus had a reduced need for the Tornado ADV; Saudi Arabia chose to convert further orders for up to 60 Tornado ADVs to the IDS strike variant instead.

During 1991, during Operation Desert Storm over neighbouring Iraq, RSAF Tornado ADVs flew 451 air-defence sorties, operating in conjunction with RSAF F-15s. In 2006, it was announced that, in addition to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s contract to purchase the Eurofighter Typhoon, both the Tornado IDS and ADV fleets would undergo a £2.5 billion program of upgrades, allowing them to remain in service to at least 2020. Despite this, by 2011, the Eurofighter had taken over from the Tornado ADV in the air-defence role.

<doc id="246714" wikidata="Q3397425" url="?curid=246714" title="Prisoner (TV series)">
<text>Prisoner (known in the UK and the US as Prisoner: Cell Block H and in Canada as Caged Women) is an Australian television soap opera, which was broadcast on Network Ten (formerly the 0-10 Network) from February 27 (Melbourne) and February 26 (Sydney) 1979 to December 1986 (Melbourne), running eight seasons and 692 episodes. 

&quot;Prisoner&quot; was the first Australian series to feature a primarily female-dominated cast and carried the slogan &quot;If you think prison is hell for a man, imagine what it would be like for a woman!&quot;
The series, produced by the Grundy Organisation, was conceived by Reg Watson and filmed at the then Network Ten Melbourne Studios at Nunawading and on location. 

The series garnered an international cult following, and it was one of Australia&#x27;s most successful media exports, exported to 80 countries, performing particularly well in the United States and Canada (billed as &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; and &quot;Caged Women&quot;, respectively). It also built a large audience in the United Kingdom and other European countries, especially Sweden. 

Sammy Davis Jr. was a major fan and visited the set, and wanted to appear in a role, but had other engagements at the time.

The cult status of the series has seen many adaptations, including the modern 21st century re-imaging series &quot;Wentworth&quot; on Foxtel.

==Background==
Ian Bradley served as original producer and then executive producer, from series 2, whilst associate producer and screenwriter was Ian Smith, who appeared as an actor in the series as Head of the Department Ted Douglas, prior to becoming famous as the character Harold Bishop in &quot;Neighbours&quot;; another screenwriter, Anne Lucas, also acted briefly in the series playing prison bookie Faye Quinn.
The series is loosely based on British prison drama series &quot;Within These Walls&quot;, although it focuses more on the prisoners or inmates, rather than the prison staff led by officious governor Faye Boswell, played by Googie Withers, who was even approached by producers of &quot;Prisoner&quot; to play the governor. 
The series is set in the fictional &quot;Wentworth Detention Centre&quot; in the fictional suburb of Wentworth in Melbourne, Victoria, and follows the lives of the prisoners and staff within cell block H and, to a lesser extent, others on the outside such as family members, doctors and lawyers. Numerous scenes also took place outside the compound exploring the lives of the inmates and staff outside of the prison; in particular, &quot;Driscoll House&quot;, a halfway house where inmates were housed after being released, or neighbouring correction institutions like Barnhurst (a lower-security country prison) and Blackmoor (an aged, yet high-security, prison).

The series gained a positive reception. Initially conceived as a standalone miniseries of 16 episodes, its popularity meant it was developed into an ongoing series. It has since endured worldwide, acquiring cult classic status, particularly for its occasionally outrageous plotlines.

==Creation and production==

&quot;Prisoner&quot; was created by Reg Watson, who had produced the British soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot; from 1964 to 1973 and then the Australian soaps &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and (post-&quot;Prisoner&quot;) &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

Inspired by the British television drama &quot;Within These Walls&quot;, the show was initially conceived as a 16-episode series, with a pilot episode bearing the working title &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;. Its storylines focused on the lives of the prisoners and, to a lesser extent, the officers and other prison staff. When the initial episodes met an enthusiastic reception, it was felt that &quot;Prisoner&quot; could be developed into an ongoing soap opera. The early storylines were developed and expanded, with assistance from the Victorian Corrective Services Department.

The show&#x27;s themes, often radical, included feminism, LGBT matters, and social reform. &quot;Prisoner&quot; began in early 1979 with the advertising slogan, &quot;If you think prison is hell for a man, imagine what it&#x27;s like for a woman&quot;. The series examined how women dealt with incarceration and separation from their families and friends, and the common phenomenon of released inmates re-offending. Within the prison, major themes were interpersonal relationships, power struggles, friendships and rivalries. The prisoners became a surrogate family, with the self-styled &quot;Queen Bea&quot;, Bea Smith and the elderly &quot;Mum&quot; (Jeanette) Brooks (Mary Ward) emerging as central matriarch figures. Several lesbian characters were introduced on the show, including prisoners Franky Doyle (played by Carol Burns), Sharon Gilmour (played by Margot Knight) and Judy Bryant (played by Betty Bobbitt), lawyer Angela Jeffries (played by Jeanie Drynan) and corrupt and sinister officer Joan Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick).

==Continuity==

Characters and story exposition were often &#x27;retconned&#x27; in order to expand potential storylines. Initially there was a men&#x27;s prison &quot;next door&quot; to Wentworth, but it was never mentioned again after the early episodes. Barnhurst was originally a co-ed prison, soon becoming a women&#x27;s facility. Its security status varied considerably, with it being described as an &#x27;open prison farm&#x27; by the end of the run; although it was often described as &quot;low-security&quot;, serial murderers Bea Smith and Marie Winter were housed there for long periods. Although Blackmoor Prison was initially described as a brand-new, state-of-the-art maximum-security prison, it was depicted as a Victorian-era workhouse when finally seen. Wentworth was variously described as either new or built during World War II, with aged infrastructure.

During the show&#x27;s run, several recurring characters were played by multiple actresses and actors. Meg Jackson&#x27;s (later Morris) (Elspeth Ballantyne) son and stepdaughter, Marty Jackson and Tracey Morris, were each played by multiple actors—Ronald Korosy, Andrew McKaige, and Michael Winchester as Marty, and Sue Devine and Michelle Thomas as Tracey. In the closing year, Nicki Paull&#x27;s character Lisa Mullins was taken over by Terrie Waddell.

==Synopsis==
Viewers&#x27; introduction to the Wentworth Detention Centre featured the arrival of two new prisoners, Karen Travers (Peta Toppano) and Lynn Warner (Kerry Armstrong). Travers was charged with murdering her husband in a crime of passion after he was found in bed with another woman (her flashback featured a shower scene that was a nod to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s classic &quot;Psycho&quot;), whilst Warner insisted she was innocent despite her conviction for the abduction and attempted murder of a child. Both women were sent to the prison&#x27;s maximum-security wing (H Block), where they were horrified by their new surroundings. Karen was confronted with a former lover—prison doctor Greg Miller (Barry Quin)—and was sexually harassed by violent lesbian cellmate Franky Doyle (Carol Burns). Lynn was ostracised by the other prisoners because of her crime (prisoners are known for their intolerance of offenders against children) and terrorised by Bea Smith, who burnt her hand in the laundry&#x27;s steam press in one of the series&#x27; most iconic early scenes.

Other, less-volatile, prisoners included elderly garden-loving Jeanette &quot;Mum&quot; Brooks (Mary Ward), who was incarcerated for the euthanasia of her husband who had terminal cancer, teddy-clutching misfit and childlike Doreen Anderson (Colette Mann), alcoholic former cook recidivist Lizzie Birdsworth (Sheila Florance), who apparently poisoned a group of shearers, and seductive prostitute Gladys &quot;Marilyn&quot; Mason (Margaret Laurence), who seduced prison electrician Eddie Cook (Richard Moir). The prison officers (or &quot;screws&quot;, as the prisoners call them) included firm-but--heeled governor Erica Davidson (Patsy King); dour deputy governor Vera Bennett (Fiona Spence), who was always wanting to become Governor and was nicknamed &quot;Vinegar Tits&quot; by Franky; and firm but compassionate senior officer Meg Jackson (later Morris) (Elspeth Ballantyne).

Early episodes featured a high level of violence: Lynn Warner&#x27;s burning in a steam press; a prisoner hanging herself in her cell; a fatal stabbing; and a flashback sequence triggered by the time Karen Travers stabbed her abusive husband to death in the shower. The series&#x27; first major story arc was the between Bea and Franky, in a bid to become the prison&#x27;s &quot;Top Dog&quot; (unofficial leader), culminating by episode 3 in a riot where Meg was held hostage and her husband—prison social worker Bill Jackson (Don Barker)—was stabbed to death by inmate Chrissie Latham (Amanda Muggleton).

===Series extension===

&quot;Prisoner&quot; premiered in Australia on 27 February 1979. Its success prompted the producers to extend the series, first from 16 to 20 episodes and then indefinitely. The production schedule increased from one- to two-hour-long episodes per week; Carol Burns left the show after 20 episodes, feeling that she could not continue playing Franky Doyle with the tighter schedule. Her storyline sees her as an escapee from Wentworth with fellow inmate Doreen Anderson, and after being on the run for three weeks, she is shot dead by a policeman.

New story arcs were introduced. Karen Travers appealed against her sentence and was eventually released, allowing her to resume her relationship with Greg Miller and becoming involved in prison reform. As original characters began leaving the series (Mum Brooks, Lynn Warner, Karen and Greg appeared beyond the initial sixteen episodes, but most had left by the end of the 1979 season; Greg left in early 1980), new characters arrived: hulking husband-beater Monica Ferguson (Lesley Baker), career criminal Noeline Bourke (Jude Kuring), troubled murderess Roslyn Coulson (Sigrid Thornton) and imprisoned mother Pat O&#x27;Connell (Monica Maughan), in addition to shorter-term inmates with brief storylines. Prostitute Chrissie Latham, a minor character in the early episodes, returned in a more central antagonistic role and a male deputy governor, Jim Fletcher (Gerard Maguire), joined the female-dominated cast.

===Final season===

Ratings had been declining for some time, and when they continued to fall in 1986, Network Ten decided in July not to renew the series. Production ended on 5 September, and the final episode aired in Melbourne on 11 December 1986. The producers had several weeks&#x27; notice that the series was ending, enabling them to construct strong concluding storylines (including the ultimate defeat of Joan &quot;the Freak&quot; Ferguson). &quot;Prisoner&quot; final episodes dealt with the redemption of the misunderstood Kath Maxwell and concluded the ongoing dynamic between Rita Connors (played by Glenda Linscott) and Joan Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick).

==Spin-offs, remakes and specials==
===Spinoffs===
====&quot;Willow B: Women in Prison&quot;====

A pilot for an unproduced American version of &quot;Prisoner&quot; was produced by Lorimar in 1980, entitled &quot;Willow B: Women in Prison&quot;. The cast included Ruth Roman, Virginia Capers, Carol Lynley, and Sally Kirkland. The pilot aired on ABC-TV on 29 June 1980.

====&quot;Wentworth&quot;====
In March 2012, it was announced that Foxtel would produce a contemporary &quot;re-imagining&quot; of &quot;Prisoner&quot;, titled &quot;Wentworth&quot;, set in modern-day Australia. &quot;Wentworth&quot; recounts the rise of Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) from her arrival at Wentworth as a remand prisoner to &quot;top dog&quot;. The series is filmed at a new, purpose-built prison set in the Melbourne suburb of Clayton.

&quot;Wentworth&quot; features contemporary versions of vintage characters along with new characters. Other characters and cast members include crime matriarch Jacs Holt (Kris McQuade), Liz Birdsworth (Celia Ireland), Doreen Anderson (Shareena Clanton), Franky Doyle (Nicole da Silva), Sue &quot;Boomer&quot; Jenkins (Katrina Milosevic), social worker Erica Davidson (Leeanna Walsman), officer Will Jackson (Robbie Magasiva), officer Matthew Fletcher (Aaron Jeffery), deputy governor Vera Bennett (Kate Atkinson), and governor Meg Jackson (Catherine McClements), and later included Linda Miles (Jacquie Brennan), Joan Ferguson (Pamela Rabe), Sean Brody (Rick Donald), Greg Miller (David de Lautour), Marie Winter (Susie Porter), and Rita Connors (Leah Purcell).

None of the original &quot;Prisoner&quot; cast were initially scheduled to appear in the first series, but on 29 November 2012 it was confirmed that Anne Charleston (who appeared in the original series) would make a guest appearance. &quot;Wentworth&quot; premiered in Australia on Foxtel&#x27;s SoHo channel on 1 May 2013. &quot;Wentworth&quot; ended in 2021 after nine seasons. It did not surpass &quot;Prisoner&quot; in terms of number of episodes (&quot;Wentworth&quot; produced only ten to twelve episodes per year culminating in 100 episodes over the course of its run, compared to 692 episodes for &quot;Prisoner&quot;), but surpassed it in the number of years on air. Thirteen actors who appeared in &quot;Prisoner&quot; also appeared in &quot;Wentworth&quot; in a guest capacity. These included Sigrid Thornton, who was in the original series as Ros Coulson, joining the &quot;Wentworth&quot; cast to play Sonia Stevens. In an ironic twist, Tina Bursill who originally played Sonia Stevens in &quot;Prisoner&quot; was cast in the final series of &quot;Wentworth&quot; as Eve Wilder.

===Spoofs===

In 1980 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a parody of the series, &quot;Debs Behind Bars&quot;. In the sketch, the inmates (including guest host Teri Garr) are spoiled debutantes who complain about &quot;icky&quot; living conditions in prison. During the early 1990s, Seven Network&#x27;s comedy sketch program &quot;Fast Forward&quot; parodied &quot;Prisoner&quot;; Gina Riley (Bea Smith), Jane Turner (Lizzie Birdsworth), Magda Szubanski (Doreen) and Marg Downey as officer (Joan Ferguson) gave scenes from the series a comedic twist.

Other series to have featured &quot;Prisoner&quot; spoofs included &quot;The Paul Hogan Show&quot;, &quot;Let the Blood Run Free&quot;, &quot;Naked Video&quot; and &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;.

===&quot;Prisoner&quot;-inspired shows===
In 1991, &quot;Prisoner&quot; was reprised for the American market as &quot;Dangerous Women&quot;. The US version borrowed heavily from the Australian original for characters and was created and written by Reg Watson, who had also created the original Australian series. In &quot;Dangerous Women&quot;, the emphasis was outside the prison, focusing on prisoner relationships in a halfway house. In 1997, &quot;Prisoner&quot; was revised in a German-language version, &quot;Hinter Gittern – Der Frauenknast&quot; (&quot;Behind Bars&quot;). The series ran from 1997 to 2007 for 16 series and 403 episodes.

===&quot;Talking Prisoner&quot;===
On June 18, 2021, producer Matt Batten created the &quot;Talking Prisoner&quot; podcast and YouTube channel. Batten&#x27;s co-host Ken Mulholland served as head cameraman on &quot;Prisoner&quot; from the series debut until episode 692. Mulholland and Batten interview cast and crew from &quot;Prisoner&quot; in depth. The podcast however also features interviews with cast and crew from other popular Australian internationally successful series like &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot;, and also featured interviews from staff at actual prisons including a 2023 interview with a warder from Ireland and a Prison Chaplin from San Quentin. In 2023 Mulholland departed the podcast to focus on his art and it was announced that filmmaker Tim Burns had joined as the new co-host of the podcast.

==Merchandise==
There have been several tie-in books and video and DVD releases. &quot;Prisoner&quot; theme song (&quot;On the Inside&quot;, sung by Lynne Hamilton) reached number four in Australia in 1979 and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart in 1989. &quot;On the Inside&quot; was re-released as a digital download and CD single in March 2012. The song was featured as a B-side on punkabilly group The Living End&#x27;s EP, &quot;Second Solution / Prisoner of Society&quot;.

===Books (tie-in publications)===
====Based on the Series====

There have been numerous publications on the series, including tie-in paperback novels, including publication&#x27;s by Pinnacle Books, which in 1980, led by the actors union the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and represented by cast member Val Lehman (Bea Smith), which saw the cast go on strike due to the content in the United States: soft-core pornography at odds with the series. Six books were published: &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;, &quot;The Franky Doyle Story&quot;, &quot;The Karen Travers Story&quot;, &quot;The Frustrations of Vera&quot;, &quot;The Reign of Queen Bea&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Erica&quot;.

Two behind-the-scenes books were published in the UK during the early 1990s. &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H – Behind the Scenes&quot; was written by Terry Bourke and published by Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers, who published similar books about soap opera&#x27;s &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot;. Bourke documents the show&#x27;s genesis and development, and the book has many stills and character profiles. Hilary Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner Cell Block H – The Inside Story&quot; emphasises more on plot and characters.

A limited-edition book, &quot;The Inside Story&quot;, was published in 2007 as part of the full-series DVD release in Australia. Written by TV journalists Andrew Mercado and Michael Idato, the commemorative book has the series&#x27; background, year-by-year storylines, character details and quotes by cast and crew. It was available as part of &quot;The Complete Collection&quot; DVD set.

====Biographies and memoirs of cast members====

There are also several published autobiographies, biographies and memoirs of cast members:

* Colette Mann published 2 books, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mann&#x27;s World&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Give Me a Break&quot; in 2002 

* Betty Bobbitt self-published &quot;From the Outside&quot;, in 2011, which are her memoirs of her career which included playing the role of Judy Bryant on &quot;Prisoner&quot;.

* Sheila Florance biography titled &quot;On the Inside&quot; was published in 2016 by Helen Martineau, which details her career as an actress and performer, including her role as Lizzie Birdsworth on Prisoner. 

* Maggie Kirkpatrick, published her own autobiography in 2019, about her performing career, titled &quot;The Gloves Are Off&quot;, named after the iconic leather gloves that she occasionally wore as Joan Ferguson on &quot;Prisoner&quot;.

===DVD releases===
The complete series of &quot;Prisoner&quot; is available on DVD format in both Australia and the United Kingdom. On Region 4 in Australia, distribution company Shock Records released the series over forty volumes, and a complete collection, comprising these volumes; the UK editions, from FremantleMedia, made the series available over twenty volumes (doubling-up on the Australian sets). In 2016, ViaVision acquired the rights to re-release the series in Australia and made the decision to release the series in their original season formats. See above for a full listing of VHS and DVD sets available. The following is an overview of &quot;Prisoner&quot; releases in their seasons formats. The use of the term &#x27;season&#x27; is a recent phenomena - perhaps tied to DVD releases. During its original run, &quot;Prisoner&quot; was considered a continuing series. Continuous episode numbers (1–692) were used on production materials such as scripts and production schedules, rather than a &#x27;Season number / Episode Number&#x27; format.

===Theatre and musicals===
A stage version of &quot;Prisoner&quot;, based on the original scripts, was produced in 1989 and toured the United Kingdom. Elspeth Ballantyne (Meg Morris) and Patsy King (Erica Davidson) reprised their characters and Glenda Linscott (Rita Connors) played a new character, Angela Mason. A second tour, with Fiona Spence (Vera Bennett) and Jane Clifton (Margo Gaffney), followed in 1990; Jacqui Gordon (Susie Driscoll) played new character Kath Evans.

A musical version followed, with Maggie Kirkpatrick reprising her role as Joan (the Freak) Ferguson and Lily Savage as an inmate. The musical, a parody of &quot;Prisoner&quot; kitschier aspects, toured and had a West End run in 1995 and 1997. Val Lehman (Bea) was critical of the production, questioning why a drag queen would be in a women&#x27;s prison.

Due to &quot;Prisoner&quot; popularity in the UK during the late 1980s, its British fan club organised personal-appearance tours for several actresses including Val Lehman (Bea Smith), Carol Burns (Franky Doyle), Betty Bobbitt (Judy Bryant), Sheila Florance (Lizzie Birdsworth), Amanda Muggleton (Chrissie Latham) and Judy McBurney (Pixie Mason). A TV special, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, was produced in 1990. The programme, which featured Val Lehman, Sheila Florance, Amanda Muggleton and Carol Burns on their 1990 UK visit, includes extensive footage of their on-stage interview with TV presenter Anna Soubry in which the cast members discuss their time on the series. Recorded at the Derby Assembly Rooms in Derby, it was briefly available in the UK on VHS video.

Several &quot;Prisoner&quot; actors have appeared in British stage drama and pantomime, including Val Lehman (&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Beatrix Potter&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot;), Peta Toppano, Fiona Spence, Maggie Dence (Bev Baker), Debra Lawrance (Daphne Graham), Linda Hartley (Roach Waters), Ian Smith (Ted Douglas) and Maggie Millar (Marie Winter).

==Popular culture references==
In 1997, a &quot;Prisoner&quot; clip from its second episode (Franky Doyle and Lynn Warner&#x27;s fight in the garden) appeared on the BBC sitcom &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, and the series was mentioned several times during &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; seven-and-a-half-year run. The theme song was played briefly in episode three of BBC sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;. &quot;Prisoner&quot; has also been referenced in British sitcoms &quot;2point4 Children&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps&quot;, as well as the soap operas &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

==International broadcast==
===United Kingdom===
&quot;Prisoner&quot; was shown on the ITV network in the UK, but was not simulcast nationally. It began airing on Yorkshire Television on 8 October 1984. Some ITV stations cut some of the more violent scenes (including the attempted hanging of Sandy Edwards and the hanging of Eve Wilder). Some also heavily edited the episode 326 fight scene with Joan Ferguson and Bea Smith, despite its time slot which was well past the 9 p.m. watershed. Some regions (such as Granada in the North-West of England) did not start to show the series until 1988, while the Ulster region in Northern Ireland was the final region of the ITV network to start broadcasting the series, in 1989. 

Border Television did not air some episodes, with a considerable gap in the middle of the run, resulting viewers not seeing the conclusion of some storylines. To rectify this, the continuity announcer relayed the plots of the missed episodes. In a comical nod to the low-budget production values of the show, the announcer would also often refer to the programme as: ‘…the wobbly walls of Wentworth’.

When Border, Grampian and Granada TV screened the final episode in the UK in the mid-1990s, continuity announcer John McKenzie conducted a telephone interview with Maggie Kirkpatrick (Joan &quot;the Freak&quot; Ferguson).

&quot;Prisoner&quot; was part of Channel 5&#x27;s schedule when it launched in 1997, with the series receiving a complete broadcast run until 2001. The series returned to the UK in September 2023 after 22 years when it was added to the channel&#x27;s streaming service My5. It was also briefly aired from the beginning on 5Select from 20 December 2023, until 1 January 2024, ceasing broadcast at episode 20, but later resumed broadcast. From Season 4, which began on 6 January 2025, it is aired on 5Select before streaming on My5. It is also currently airing from the beginning, as of 3 January 2024, on That&#x27;s TV 2.

===United States===

The series was first aired in the United States on KTLA in Los Angeles on 8 August 1979, initially under the original name, &quot;Prisoner&quot;. The series, whose first two episodes were screened as a two-hour special, was viewed by a quarter of all television viewers in the Los Angeles market and was in second place for the night, beaten only by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

The series would later be repackaged into a daily half-hour format, as &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;, KYW-TV ran this format under the title &quot;The Women of Cell Block H&quot;. It was syndicated directly to local stations through Firestone Program Syndication Company during the early 1980s (particularly 1980 to &#x27;81). In New York City, where &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; was telecast on WPIX, it was rated higher than late-night staple &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on WNBC and reruns of legendary series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; on WNEW-TV, and paved the way for other popular Australian produced shows including miniseries &quot;Against the Wind&quot; and serial &quot;The Sullivans&quot; to be sold to international markets.

Under the half-hour format, the original episodes were broadcast in two parts, though some scenes were censored or removed for the US telecast. 

KTLA, however, continued to broadcast the series in a weekly hour format, though now Tuesdays at 8 p.m., and under the &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; name. Picked up in at least 38 markets in early 1980, the program would leave the American airwaves by spring 1982, after the few stations that were still carrying the program, such as KOB-TV and WGN-TV, removed &quot;Prisoner&quot; from their schedules.

During the spring and summer of 1985, the series was screened nationally on USA Network, weekdays at 11 a.m. ET, also in a half-hour format. It is unknown which episodes were televised.

===Canada===
In Canada, &quot;Prisoner&quot; began on 10 September 1979 as &quot;Caged Women&quot; on Global Television Network, at the time a small television network serving southern and eastern Ontario; the program was seen weekly on Monday nights at 9pm

The show would move to Tuesdays at 9 p.m. in the fall of 1980, continuing with the &quot;Caged Women&quot; title. The show would be off the schedule by the 1981–1982 television season, but by the fall of 1982, Global would reintroduce the show to the schedule, still as &quot;Caged Women&quot;, in the half-hour format, weeknights at midnight and 12:30am. The program would be off the schedule by the start of the 1983–1984 season.

Curiously, Global&#x27;s use of &quot;Caged Women&quot; would continue even after the show debuted in the United States as &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;, which led to viewers in the communities along the Ontario / Michigan border to watch the same program under two different titles: &quot;Caged Women&quot; on Global, and &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; on WKBD-TV Detroit.

In Vancouver, Victoria and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; was telecast under that title weekdays at 1pm during 1980 and 1981 on KVOS-TV, an independent station in Bellingham, Washington that included the greater Vancouver / Victoria region as part of its viewing area.

===Sweden===
The series was shown in Sweden where it was a cult broadcast on TV4, from 7 September 1994 and entitled &quot;Kvinofangelset&quot; (The Women&#x27;s Prison). a fan club organised a regular get together and collected several thousands of signatures from fans to repeat the series in again, which TV4 did so in 2000, After the series ended that year, work began to persuade the network to repeat the series a third time. The network originally screened the series three times a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) in the late night program slot of 1am, with the final episode airing on 3 February 2000.

During the repeat run from 2000 until October 2004, the network screening was four times a week (Monday to Thursday) at 2:15 am. The episodes were then repeated on weekends with both the Monday and Tuesday episode on Saturday and the Wednesday and Thursday episodes on Sunday.

The second rerun began in May 2014, by station TV4 Guld and again airing Monday through to Thursdays, and screening at 10:00pm, with episode 32 on July 3.
The broadcast schedule was later changed to five nights a week airing at midnight. Season 8 began broadcasting Sjuan in September 2017 at 3:00 pm.

===Other countries===
In New Zealand, &quot;Prisoner&quot; was first shown on TV2 on Monday 2 March 1981 and aired up to four afternoons a week, Monday to Thursday, at 2:30 p.m. before moving to twice a week, Mondays and Tuesdays, in the same timeslot by October 1985. On Monday 9 February 1987, the series was moved to TV One and continued to air Mondays and Tuesdays at around 2:30 p.m. until Thursday 23 July 1987 when it aired only on Thursdays in that slot. The final episode of &quot;Prisoner&quot; was broadcast on Friday 16 September 1988 at 2:35 p.m. The series was rerun on Orange and, later, Sky 1.

In South Africa, public television network SABC 1 began airing the series in 1998, screening Thursday nights at 9 p.m. and a repeat showing on Fridays at 10:45; it was cancelled on 2 October 2000, after episode 156.

In Brazil, &quot;Prisoner&quot; aired as &quot;As Prisioneiras&quot; around the end of 1980 and early 1981 by TVS (since renamed SBT). The show was dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese locally by TVS and was cancelled after episode 82 had screened.

==Australian reruns==

After Network Ten in Sydney, NSW had played the original run of the series, it returned in syndication for a second complete series rerun during weeknights around 10.30-11.00pm during most of the year of 1990 though due to The Gulf War conflict coverage the reruns were abruptly rescheduled weekday mornings from 4am through to the series finale a few years later. The series was replayed for a third time during the mid-1990s on Channel Ten in Sydney, NSW now screening at weekday afternoons from 1pm and then later at 1.30pm. The series has not been seen since on its original commercial Channel Ten since that period.
Network Ten began rerunning &quot;Prisoner&quot; on 8 May 1995; the series was cancelled, despite promises that it would return after the 1996 Christmas break. BBC UKTV began airing it from the beginning on 30 November 1997, at 12:15am on Tuesday and Thursday and 11:30pm on Saturday and Sunday. A repeat was broadcast at 2pm on Monday. From March 2022, the show is available for streaming at 10play. 

Foxtel channel 111 channel began airing the series on 7 March 2011 at 6:30pm AEDT, later moving to 5:30pm AEDT on 10 December 2012. Each episode was repeated the following afternoon, with the final episode on the initial run airing on 11 November 2013. The next day, the channel began a repeat run from episode one at 3:00pm AEDT, later moving to 1:00pm AEST on 7 July 2014. Foxtel held unlimited screening rights to the series until 2019, airing the series 4 times back to back (from 2011 to 2019). Foxtel&#x27;s final broadcast was on September 11, 2019. 

The series&#x27; popularity on Foxtel inspired plans for a modern-day remake.

Believing that &quot;Prisoner&quot; would resonate with new audiences, in 2010 111 group programming director Darren Chau planned to replay the series against the introduction of digital channel Eleven and Network Ten&#x27;s plan to move &quot;Neighbours&quot; to Eleven. The channel ran a promotional campaign highlighting the rerun, with a new version of the theme song by Ella Hooper and a cast reunion. 

As of 2023, &quot;Prisoner&quot; was available on the streaming channel 10Play in Australia and is also available on Pluto TV 24 hours a day with back to back episodes streaming.

<text>Live at the Greek: Excess All Areas is a double live album by Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes, released by musicmaker.com on 29 February 2000 and reissued by TVT Records on 4 July 2000.

On the October 18th and 19th dates of their 1999 tour, at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes recorded songs from their performances, which were released on a live album in 2000. Songs performed included material from the Led Zeppelin and the Black Crowes catalogues and old blues and rock standards. &quot;I didn&#x27;t really have that much fun doing it,&quot; said singer Chris Robinson. &quot;It was alright, and Jimmy&#x27;s a phenomenal guitarist, but to me it was just a job. I&#x27;m not a big fan of Robert Plant&#x27;s lyrics or his singing, so that part of it was a little boring for me.&quot;

Contractual restrictions with the Black Crowes’ record company, Columbia Records, prevented their own songs (such as &quot;Wiser Time&quot;, &quot;No Speak, No Slave&quot;, &quot;Remedy&quot;, and &quot;Hard to Handle”), performed with Page at the Greek Theatre shows, from being included on the album.

The version of the double CD released later in 2000 featured a different running order, an extra song, an enhanced QuickTime video and photographs taken during the concert. The Japanese version of the album adds &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and &quot;In the Light&quot;, recorded in 2000.

Bassist Sven Pipien was fired between the two releases of the album and was airbrushed out of the group photograph in the centerfold of the TVT Records version and all subsequent vinyl reissues. The original image appearing on the musicmaker.com release can be viewed on a blog about Jimmy Page.

<text>In mathematics, the operator norm measures the &quot;size&quot; of certain linear operators by assigning each a real number called its . Formally, it is a norm defined on the space of bounded linear operators between two given normed vector spaces. Informally, the operator norm formula_1 of a linear map formula_2 is the maximum factor by which it &quot;lengthens&quot; vectors.

== Introduction and definition ==

Given two normed vector spaces formula_3 and formula_4 (over the same base field, either the real numbers formula_5 or the complex numbers formula_6), a linear map formula_7 is continuous if and only if there exists a real number formula_8 such that
formula_9

The norm on the left is the one in formula_4 and the norm on the right is the one in formula_3. 
Intuitively, the continuous operator formula_12 never increases the length of any vector by more than a factor of formula_13 Thus the image of a bounded set under a continuous operator is also bounded. Because of this property, the continuous linear operators are also known as bounded operators. 
In order to &quot;measure the size&quot; of formula_14 one can take the infimum of the numbers formula_8 such that the above inequality holds for all formula_16 
This number represents the maximum scalar factor by which formula_12 &quot;lengthens&quot; vectors. 
In other words, the &quot;size&quot; of formula_12 is measured by how much it &quot;lengthens&quot; vectors in the &quot;biggest&quot; case. So we define the operator norm of formula_12 as
formula_20

The infimum is attained as the set of all such formula_8 is closed, nonempty, and bounded from below.

It is important to bear in mind that this operator norm depends on the choice of norms for the normed vector spaces formula_3 and formula_4.

== Examples ==

Every real formula_24-by-formula_25 matrix corresponds to a linear map from formula_26 to formula_27 Each pair of the plethora of (vector) norms applicable to real vector spaces induces an operator norm for all formula_24-by-formula_25 matrices of real numbers; these induced norms form a subset of matrix norms.

If we specifically choose the Euclidean norm on both formula_26 and formula_31 then the matrix norm given to a matrix formula_12 is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix formula_33 (where formula_34 denotes the conjugate transpose of formula_12). 
This is equivalent to assigning the largest singular value of formula_36

Passing to a typical infinite-dimensional example, consider the sequence space formula_37 which is an L&quot;p&quot; space, defined by
formula_38

This can be viewed as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Euclidean space formula_39 
Now consider a bounded sequence formula_40 The sequence formula_41 is an element of the space formula_42 with a norm given by
formula_43

Define an operator formula_44 by pointwise multiplication:
formula_45

The operator formula_44 is bounded with operator norm
formula_47

This discussion extends directly to the case where formula_48 is replaced by a general formula_49 space with formula_50 and formula_51 replaced by formula_52

==Equivalent definitions==

Let formula_7 be a linear operator between normed spaces. The first four definitions are always equivalent, and if in addition formula_54 then they are all equivalent:
:formula_55
If formula_56 then the sets in the last two rows will be empty, and consequently their supremums over the set formula_57 will equal formula_58 instead of the correct value of formula_59 If the supremum is taken over the set formula_60 instead, then the supremum of the empty set is formula_61 and the formulas hold for any formula_62 

Importantly, a linear operator formula_7 is not, in general, guaranteed to achieve its norm formula_64 on the closed unit ball formula_65 meaning that there might not exist any vector formula_66 of norm formula_67 such that formula_68 (if such a vector does exist and if formula_69 then formula_70 would necessarily have unit norm formula_71). R.C. James proved James&#x27;s theorem in 1964, which states that a Banach space formula_3 is reflexive if and only if every bounded linear functional formula_73 achieves its norm on the closed unit ball. 
It follows, in particular, that every non-reflexive Banach space has some bounded linear functional (a type of bounded linear operator) that does not achieve its norm on the closed unit ball.

If formula_7 is bounded then 
formula_75
and 
formula_76
where formula_77 is the transpose of formula_78 which is the linear operator defined by formula_79

== Properties ==

The operator norm is indeed a norm on the space of all bounded operators between formula_3 and formula_4. This means
formula_82
formula_83
formula_84

The following inequality is an immediate consequence of the definition:
formula_85

The operator norm is also compatible with the composition, or multiplication, of operators: if formula_3, formula_4 and formula_88 are three normed spaces over the same base field, and formula_7 and formula_90 are two bounded operators, then it is a sub-multiplicative norm, that is: 
formula_91

For bounded operators on formula_3, this implies that operator multiplication is jointly continuous.

It follows from the definition that if a sequence of operators converges in operator norm, it converges uniformly on bounded sets.

== Table of common operator norms ==

By choosing different norms for the codomain, used in computing formula_93, and the domain, used in computing formula_94, we obtain different values for the operator norm. Some common operator norms are easy to calculate, and others are NP-hard. 
Except for the NP-hard norms, all these norms can be calculated in formula_95 operations (for an formula_96 matrix), with the exception of the formula_97 norm (which requires formula_98 operations for the exact answer, or fewer if you approximate it with the power method or Lanczos iterations).

The norm of the adjoint or transpose can be computed as follows. 
We have that for any formula_99 then formula_100 where formula_101 are Hölder conjugate to formula_99 that is, formula_103 and formula_104

== Operators on a Hilbert space ==

Suppose formula_105 is a real or complex Hilbert space. If formula_106 is a bounded linear operator, then we have
formula_107
and
formula_108
where formula_34 denotes the adjoint operator of formula_12 (which in Euclidean spaces with the standard inner product corresponds to the conjugate transpose of the matrix formula_12).

In general, the spectral radius of formula_12 is bounded above by the operator norm of formula_12:
formula_114

To see why equality may not always hold, consider the Jordan canonical form of a matrix in the finite-dimensional case. Because there are non-zero entries on the superdiagonal, equality may be violated. The quasinilpotent operators is one class of such examples. A nonzero quasinilpotent operator formula_12 has spectrum formula_116 So formula_117 while formula_118

However, when a matrix formula_119 is normal, its Jordan canonical form is diagonal (up to unitary equivalence); this is the spectral theorem. In that case it is easy to see that
formula_120

This formula can sometimes be used to compute the operator norm of a given bounded operator formula_12: define the Hermitian operator formula_122 determine its spectral radius, and take the square root to obtain the operator norm of formula_36

The space of bounded operators on formula_124 with the topology induced by operator norm, is not separable. 
For example, consider the Lp space formula_125 which is a Hilbert space. 
For formula_126 let formula_127 be the characteristic function of formula_128 and formula_129 be the multiplication operator given by formula_130 that is,
formula_131

Then each formula_129 is a bounded operator with operator norm 1 and
formula_133

But formula_134 is an uncountable set. 
This implies the space of bounded operators on formula_135 is not separable, in operator norm. 
One can compare this with the fact that the sequence space formula_136 is not separable.

The associative algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space, together with the operator norm and the adjoint operation, yields a C*-algebra.

<doc id="246725" wikidata="Q486727" url="?curid=246725" title="Symposium (Plato)">
<text>The Symposium () is a Socratic dialogue by Plato, dated . It depicts a friendly contest of extemporaneous speeches given by a group of notable Athenian men attending a banquet. The men include the philosopher Socrates, the general and statesman Alcibiades, and the comic playwright Aristophanes. The panegyrics are to be given in praise of Eros, the god of love and sex.

In the &quot;Symposium&quot;, Eros is recognized both as erotic lover and as a phenomenon capable of inspiring courage, valor, great deeds and works, and vanquishing man&#x27;s natural fear of death. It is seen as transcending its earthly origins and attaining spiritual heights. The extraordinary elevation of the concept of love raises a question of whether some of the most extreme extents of meaning might be intended as humor or farce. &quot;Eros&quot; is almost always translated as &quot;love,&quot; and the English word has its own varieties and ambiguities that provide additional challenges to the effort to understand the &quot;Eros&quot; of ancient Athens.

The dialogue is one of Plato&#x27;s major works, and is appreciated for both its philosophical content and its literary qualities.

==Literary form==
The &quot;Symposium&quot; is a dialogue—a form used by Plato in more than 30 works. However, unlike in many of his other works, most of it is a series of speeches from different characters. Socrates is renowned for his dialogic approach to knowledge (often referred to as the Socratic Method), which involves posing questions that encourage others to think deeply about what they care about and articulate their ideas. In the &quot;Symposium&quot;, the dialectic exists among the speeches: in seeing how the ideas conflict from speech-to-speech, and in the effort to resolve the contradictions and see the philosophy that underlies them all. Some of the characters are historical, but this is not a report of historical events. There is no reason to doubt that they were composed entirely by Plato. The reader, understanding that Plato was not governed by the historical record, can read the &quot;Symposium&quot;, and ask why the author, Plato, arranged the story the way he did, and what he meant by including the various aspects of setting, composition, characters, and theme, etc.

==Setting and historical context==

The event depicted in the &quot;Symposium&quot; is a banquet attended by a group of men, who have come to the symposium, which was, in ancient Greece, a traditional part of the same banquet that took place after the meal, when drinking for pleasure was accompanied by music, dancing, recitals, or conversation. The setting means that the participants would be drinking wine, meaning that the men might be induced to say things they would not say elsewhere or when sober. They might speak more frankly, or take more risks, or else be prone to hubris—they might even be inspired to make speeches that are particularly heartfelt and noble. This is, of course, excluding Socrates, as Alcibiades claims in his speech that &quot;no one has ever seen Socrates drunk&quot; (C. Gill, p. 61). Implying that these are subjects which Socrates holds personally dear regardless, as evident elsewhere in the book as well, like with his account of the conversation between himself and Diotima of Mantinea.

Eryximachus has challenged the men to deliver, each, in turn, a panegyric—in this case, a speech in praise of Love (Eros). Though other participants comply with this challenge, Socrates notably refuses to participate in such an act of praise and instead takes a very different approach to the topic. The party takes place at the house of the tragedian Agathon in Athens.

It is considered that the work was written no earlier than 385 BC, and the party to which it makes reference has been fixed in 416 BC, the year in which the host Agathon had the dramatic triumph mentioned in the text. The disastrous expedition to Syracuse, of which Alcibiades was a commander, took place the following year, after which Alcibiades deserted to Sparta, Athens&#x27; archenemy.

== Principal characters ==
The dialogue&#x27;s seven main characters, who deliver major speeches, are:
* Phaedrus (speech begins 178a): an Athenian aristocrat associated with the inner-circle of the philosopher Socrates, familiar from &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and other dialogues
* Pausanias (speech begins 180c): the legal expert
* Eryximachus (speech begins 186a): a physician
* Aristophanes (speech begins 189c): the eminent comic playwright
* Agathon (speech begins 195a): a tragic poet, host of the banquet, that celebrates the triumph of his first tragedy
* Socrates (speech begins 201d): the eminent philosopher and Plato&#x27;s teacher
* Alcibiades (speech begins 214e): a prominent Athenian statesman, orator, and general

==Synopsis==
=== Frame story ===
Apollodorus of Phalerum—a passionate follower of Socrates—recounts the story of the symposium to an unnamed friend, having narrated the events to Glaucon while en route home the previous day. The banquet had been hosted by the poet Agathon to celebrate his first victory in a dramatic competition at the Dionysia of 416 BC. Though Apollodorus was not present at the event, which occurred when he was a boy, he heard the story from Aristodemus and confirmed the events with Socrates.

The story, as told by Apollodorus, then moves to the banquet at Agathon&#x27;s home, where Agathon challenges each of the men to speak in praise of the Greek god, Eros.

Socrates is late to arrive because he became lost in thought on the way. When they are finished eating, Eryximachus takes the suggestion made by Phaedrus, that they should all make a speech in praise of Eros, the god of love and desire. It will be a competition of speeches to be judged by Dionysus. It is anticipated that the speeches will ultimately be bested by Socrates, who speaks last.

=== Phaedrus&#x27; speech ===
Phaedrus opens with the claim that Eros is the oldest of the gods, citing Hesiod, Acusilaus and Parmenides, and argues that being the oldest implies that the benefits conferred by Eros are the greatest. Eros provides guidance through shame; for example, by inspiring a lover to earn the admiration of his beloved into showing bravery on the battlefield, since nothing shames a man more than to be seen by his beloved committing an inglorious act. Lovers sometimes sacrifice their lives for their beloved. As evidence for this, he mentions some mythological heroes and lovers. Even Achilles, who was the beloved of Patroclus, sacrificed himself to avenge his lover, and Alcestis was willing to die for her husband Admetus. Phaedrus concludes his short speech reiterating his statements that love is one of the most ancient gods, the most honored, the most powerful in helping men gain honor and blessedness—and sacrificing one&#x27;s self for love will result in rewards from the gods.

=== Pausanias&#x27; speech ===

Inspired by the cults of &quot;Aphrodite Pandemos&quot; and &quot;Aphrodite Urania&quot;, Pausanias—the legal expert of the group—introduces a distinction between (Πάνδημος) and (Οὐρανία) love. Vulgar Love is in search of sexual gratification, and his objects are women and boys; Heavenly Love is the pederastic love towards young men (before the age when his beard starts to grow), which produce the benefits described by Phaedrus.

Pausanias contrasts common desire with a &quot;heavenly&quot; love between an older man and a young man, in which the two exchange sexual pleasure while the older man imparts wisdom to the younger one. He distinguishes between this virtuous love, and the love of an older man for a young (immature) boy, which he says should be forbidden on the grounds that love should be based on qualities of intelligence and virtue that are not yet part of a boy&#x27;s makeup and may not develop.

He then analyses the attitudes of different city-states on homosexuality. The first distinction he makes is between the cities that clearly establish what is and what is not admitted, and those that are not so explicitly clear, like Athens. In the first group there are cities favorable to homosexuality, like Elis, Boeotia and Sparta, or unfavorable to it like Ionia and Persia. The case of Athens is analyzed with many examples of what would be acceptable and what would not, and at the end, he makes the assertion that Athens&#x27; code of behavior favors the nobler type of love and discourages the baser.

=== Eryximachus&#x27; speech ===
Though it is Aristophanes&#x27; turn, a bout of hiccups prevent him from speaking, and Eryximachus—the physician—takes his turn, prescribing various hiccup cures in the interim. Eryximachus claims love affects everything in the universe, including plants and animals; once love is attained, it should be protected. Eros not only directs everything on the human plane, but also on the divine. Two forms of love occur in the human body—one is healthy, the other unhealthy (186bc). Love encourages sophrosyne, or soundness of mind and character; He governs medicine, music, and astronomy, and even regulates hot and cold and wet and dry, which—when in balance—result in health (see: Humorism).

Throughout Eryximachus&#x27; speech, Aristophanes tries unsuccessfully to end his hiccoughing fit by holding his breath and gargling with water, until finally sneezing brought about by having his nosed tickled with a feather ends the comic scene.

=== Aristophanes&#x27; speech ===
Before starting his speech, Aristophanes warns the group that his panegyric to love may be more absurd than funny. His speech gives an explanation of why people in love say they feel &quot;whole&quot; when they have found their love-partner. He begins by explaining that people must understand human nature before they can interpret the origins of love and how it affects their own times. This is, he says because in primal times people had doubled bodies, with faces and limbs turned away from one another. As spherical creatures who wheeled around like clowns doing cartwheels (190a), these original people were very powerful. There were three sexes: male, female, and hermaphrodite; they were said to have descended from the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, respectively. These creatures tried to scale the heights of Olympus and planned to set upon the gods (190b–c). Zeus thought about blasting them with thunderbolts, but, not wanting to deprive himself of their devotions and offerings, so he decided to cripple them by chopping them in half, in effect separating each entity&#x27;s two bodies.

Ever since that time, people run around saying they are looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were separated from women run after their own kind—whence lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men (191e). Halves of hermaphroditic wholes are the men and women who engage in heterosexual love. Aristophanes says some people think homosexuals are shameless, but he praises their &quot;confidence, courage and manliness&quot;: only homosexuals &quot;prove to be real men in politics&quot; (192a), and many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful (191e). Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated (192c). This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained. Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the ax again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart once again (193a).

=== Agathon&#x27;s speech ===
Agathon complains that the previous speakers have made the mistake of congratulating mankind on the blessings of love, failing to give due praise to the god himself (194e): Love, in fact, is the youngest of the gods and is an enemy of old age (195b); Eros shuns the very sight of senility and clings to youth; he is dainty, tiptoeing through the flowers, never settling where there is no &quot;bud to bloom&quot; (196b). Agathon also implies that Love is the source of all human virtues: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Temperance.

=== Socrates&#x27; speech ===
Before Socrates gives his speech he asks some questions of Agathon regarding the nature of love. Socrates then relates a story he was told by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful but is the desire for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the &quot;form of beauty&quot;, which humans must try to achieve.

=== Alcibiades&#x27; speech ===
When Socrates is nearly done, Alcibiades crashes in, terribly drunk, and delivers a panegyric to Socrates himself. No matter how hard he has tried, he says, he has never been able to seduce Socrates, because Socrates has no interest in physical pleasure. Despite this speech, Agathon lies down next to Socrates, much to Alcibiades&#x27; chagrin.

=== Conclusion ===
The party becomes wild and drunken, with the symposium coming to an end. Many of the main characters take the opportunity to depart and return home. Aristodemus goes to sleep. When he wakes up the next morning and prepares to leave the house, Socrates is still awake, proclaiming to Agathon and Aristophanes that a skillful playwright should be able to write comedy as well as tragedy (223d). When Agathon and Aristophanes fall asleep, Socrates rises up and walks to the Lyceum to wash and tend to his daily business as usual, not going home to sleep until that evening (223d).

== Analysis of speeches ==

=== Aristophanes ===
The speech has become a focus of subsequent scholarly debate—it is seen sometimes as mere comic relief, and sometimes as satire: the creation myth Aristophanes puts forward to account for sexuality may be read as poking fun at the myths concerning the origins of humanity, numerous in classical Greek mythology.

=== Agathon ===
His speech may be regarded as self-consciously poetic and rhetorical, composed in the way of the sophists, gently mocked by Socrates. Although devoid of philosophical content, the speech Plato puts in the mouth of Agathon is a beautiful formal one, and Agathon contributes to the Platonic love theory with the idea that the object of love is beauty.

=== Socrates ===

Socrates turns politely to Agathon and, after expressing admiration for his speech, asks whether he could examine his positions further. What follows is a series of questions and answers, typical of Plato&#x27;s earlier dialogues, featuring Socrates&#x27; famous method of dialectics. First, he asks Agathon whether it is reasonable for someone to desire what they already have, like for example someone who is in perfect health to wish he were healthy (200a-e). Agathon agrees with Socrates that this would be irrational, but is quickly reminded of his own definition of Love&#x27;s true desires: youth and beauty. Putting the two together then, for Love to desire youth he must not have it himself, thus making him old, and for him to desire beauty, he himself must be ugly. Agathon has no choice but to agree.

After this exchange, Socrates switches to storytelling, a departure from the earlier dialogues where he is mostly heard refuting his opponent&#x27;s arguments through rational debating. Socrates tells of a conversation he had with Diotima, who plays the same inquiring/instructing role that Socrates played with Agathon.

Diotima first explains that Love is neither a god, as was previously claimed by the other guests, nor a mortal but a daemon, a spirit halfway between god and man, who was born during a banquet thrown by the gods to celebrate the birth of Aphrodite. One of the guests was Porus, the god of resource or plenty, who was passed out from drinking too much nectar, and it so happened that another deity arrived, Poverty, who came to the banquet to beg, and upon seeing Porus lying unconscious took the chance to sleep with him, conceiving a child in the process: Love. Having been conceived at Aphrodite&#x27;s birthday party, he became her follower and servant, but through his real origins Love acquired a kind of double nature. From his mother, Love became poor, ugly, and with no place to sleep (203c-d), while from his father he inherited the knowledge of beauty, as well as the cunningness to pursue it. Being of an intermediary nature, Love is also halfway between wisdom and ignorance, knowing just enough to understand his ignorance and try to overcome it. Beauty then is the perennial philosopher, the &quot;lover of wisdom&quot; (the Greek word &quot;philia&quot; being one of the four words for love).

After describing Love&#x27;s origins, that provide clues to its nature, Diotima asks Socrates why is it, as he had previously agreed, that love is always that &quot;of beautiful things&quot; (204b). For if love affects everyone indiscriminately, then why is it that only some appear to pursue beauty throughout their lives? Socrates does not have the answer and so Diotima reveals it: Beauty is not the end but the means to something greater, the achievement of a certain reproduction and birth (206c), the only claim that mortals can have on immortality. This is true for men as well as animals that seek an appropriate place to give birth, preferring to roam in pain until they find it. Some men are pregnant in body alone and, just like animals, enjoy the company of women with whom they can have children that will pass on their existence. Others are pregnant in both body and mind, and instead of children they carry wisdom, virtue, and above all, the art of civic order (209a). Beauty is also their guide, but it will be towards the knowledge needed to accomplish their spiritual births.

In conclusion, Diotima gives Socrates a guide on how a man of this class should be brought up from a young age. First, he should start by loving a particular body he finds beautiful, but as time goes by, he will relax his passion and pass to the love of all bodies. From this point, he will pass to the love of beautiful minds, and then to that of knowledge. Finally, he will reach the ultimate goal, which is to witness beauty in itself, rather than representations (211a-b), the true Form of Beauty in Platonic terms.

This speech, in the interpretation of Marsilio Ficino in &quot;De Amore&quot; (1484), is the origin of the concept of Platonic love.

=== Alcibiades ===

Entering upon the scene late and inebriated, Alcibiades pays tribute to Socrates. Like Agathon and Aristophanes, Alcibiades is a historical person from ancient Athens. A year after the events of the &quot;Symposium&quot;, his political enemies would drive him to flee Athens under fear of being sentenced to death for sacrilege and turn traitor to the Spartans. By his own admission, he is very handsome.

Finding himself seated on a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed to sit next to the most handsome man in the room. Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Wondering why everyone seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night&#x27;s agreement (213e, c); after Socrates was ending his drunken ramblings, Alcibiades hopes that no one will believe a word Socrates was talking about, Alcibiades proposes to offer a panegyric to Socrates (214c–e).

Alcibiades begins by comparing Socrates to a statue of Silenus; the statue is ugly and hollow, and inside it is full of tiny golden statues of the gods (215a–b). Alcibiades then compares Socrates to a satyr. Satyrs were often portrayed with the sexual appetite, manners, and features of wild beasts, and often with a large erection.

Alcibiades states that when he hears Socrates speak, he feels overwhelmed. The words of Socrates are the only ones to have ever upset him so deeply that his soul started to realize that his aristocratic life was no better than a slave&#x27;s (215e). Socrates is the only man who has ever made Alcibiades feel shame (216b). Yet all this is the least of it (216c)—Alcibiades was intrigued to allow himself to follow Socrates (216d). Most people, he continues, do not know what Socrates is like on the inside:

He was deeply curious towards Socrates&#x27; intelligence and wisdom, but Alcibiades really wanted him sexually at the time that Socrates, a man that gave only Platonic love to everyone he has encountered, gave up teaching everything he knew towards Alcibiades because of his pride, lust, and immoral conduct upon him (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates &quot;as if I were the lover and he my young prey!&quot; (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to fantasize a view towards Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c–d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades was wrong and Socrates knows there is no use in him (218e–219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, in his deep humiliation, Alcibiades made no sexual attempt (219b–d).

In his speech, Alcibiades goes on to describe Socrates&#x27; virtues, his incomparable valour in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades&#x27; life and then refused to accept honours for it (219e–221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c).

==Interpretations==
The portrayal of Socrates in the &quot;Symposium&quot; (for instance his refusal to give in to Alcibiades&#x27; sexual advances) is consistent with the account of Socrates put forward by Xenophon, who also wrote his own &quot;Symposium&quot;, and the theories that Socrates defends throughout the Platonic corpus. Plato shows off his master as a man of high moral standards, unstirred by baser urges and fully committed to the study and practice of proper self-government in both individuals and communities (the so-called &quot;royal science&quot;). The dialogue&#x27;s ending contrasts Socrates&#x27; intellectual and emotional self-mastery with Alcibiades&#x27; debauchery and lack of moderation to explain the latter&#x27;s reckless political career, disastrous military campaigns, and eventual demise. Alcibiades is corrupted by his physical beauty and its advantages; he ultimately fails to ascend to the Form of Beauty through philosophy.

Martha Nussbaum considers the possibility that the &quot;Symposium&quot; is intended to criticize Socrates and his philosophy, and to reject certain aspects of his behavior, and that Plato intends to portray Socratic philosophy as something that has lost touch with the actual individual as it devoted itself to abstract principles.

One critic, James Arieti, considers that the &quot;Symposium&quot; resembles a drama, with emotional and dramatic events occurring especially when Alcibiades crashes the banquet. Arieti suggests that it should be studied more as a drama, with a focus on character and actions, and less as an exploration of philosophical ideas. This suggests that the characters speak, as in a play, not as the author, but as themselves. This theory, Arieti has found, reveals how much each of the speakers of the &quot;Symposium&quot; resembles the god, Eros, that they each are describing. It may be Plato&#x27;s point to suggest that when humankind talks about god, they are drawn towards creating that god in their own image.

Andrew Dalby considers the opening pages of the &quot;Symposium&quot; the best depiction in any ancient Greek source of the way texts are transmitted by oral tradition without writing. It shows how an oral text may have no simple origin, and how it can be passed along by repeated tellings, and by different narrators, and how it can be sometimes verified, and sometimes corrupted. The story of the symposium is being told by Apollodorus to his friend. Apollodorus was not himself at the banquet, but heard the story from Aristodemus, a man who was there. Also, Apollodorus was able to confirm parts of the story with Socrates himself, who was one of the speakers at the banquet. In addition, the story that Socrates narrates when it is his turn to speak was told to Socrates by Diotima.

Walter Hamilton remarks that Plato takes care to portray Alcibiades and Socrates and their relationship in a way that makes it clear that Socrates had not been a bad influence on Alcibiades. Plato does this to free his teacher from the guilt of corrupting the minds of prominent youths, which had, in fact, earned Socrates the death sentence in 399 BC.

===As a response to Aristophanes===
Aristophanes&#x27; comedy, &quot;The Frogs&quot; (405 BC), attacks the new tragedy of Agathon and Euripides, and opposes it to the old tragedy of Aeschylus. In &quot;The Frogs&quot;, Dionysus, the god of theatre and wine, descends into Hades and observes a heated dispute between Aeschylus and Euripides over who is the best in tragedy. Dionysus is engaged to be the judge, and decides the outcome, not based on the merits of the two tragedians, but based on their political stance regarding the political figure, Alcibiades. Since Aeschylus prefers Alcibiades, Dionysus declares Aeschylus the winner.

That contest provides the basic structure on which the &quot;Symposium&quot; is modeled as a kind of sequel: In the &quot;Symposium&quot;, Agathon has just celebrated a victory the day before and is now hosting another kind of debate, this time it is between a tragedian, a comic poet, and Socrates. At the beginning of the &quot;Symposium&quot;, Agathon asserts that &quot;Dionysus will be the judge&quot;, and Dionysus is, though Alcibiades performs as a surrogate for the god. So the character, Alcibiades, who was the deciding factor in the debate in &quot;The Frogs&quot;, becomes the judge in the &quot;Symposium&quot;, and he now rules in favor of Socrates, who had been attacked by Aristophanes in &quot;The Clouds&quot;. The Symposium is a response to &quot;The Frogs&quot;, and shows Socrates winning not only over Aristophanes, who was the author of both &quot;The Frogs&quot;, and &quot;The Clouds&quot;, but also over the tragic poet who was portrayed in that comedy as the victor.

<text>The M2 machine gun or Browning .50 caliber machine gun (informally, &quot;Ma Deuce&quot;) is a heavy machine gun that was designed near the end of World War I by John Browning. While similar to Browning&#x27;s M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the .30-06 cartridge, the M2 uses Browning&#x27;s larger and more powerful .50 BMG (12.7 mm) cartridge. The design has had many designations; the official U.S. military designation for the infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible. It has been used against infantry, light armored vehicles, watercraft, light fortifications, and low-flying aircraft.

The gun has been used extensively as a vehicle weapon and for aircraft armament by the United States since the 1930s. It was heavily used during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Falklands War, the Soviet–Afghan War, the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan. It is the primary heavy machine gun of NATO countries and has been used by many other countries as well. U.S. forces have used the M2 longer than any other firearm except the .45 ACP M1911 pistol, which was also designed by John Browning.

The M2HB (heavy barrel) is manufactured in the U.S. by General Dynamics, Ohio Ordnance Works, U.S. Ordnance, and FN Herstal for sale to the U.S. government and other nations via Foreign Military Sales.

==History==
Machine guns were heavily used in World War I, and weapons of larger than rifle caliber began appearing on both sides of the conflict. The larger rounds were needed to pierce the armor that was being introduced to the battlefield, both on the ground and in the air. Germany introduced the Junkers J.I aircraft, whose armor could render ineffective aircraft machine guns that used conventional rifle ammunition such as the .30-06. Consequently, the American Expeditionary Force&#x27;s commander General John J. Pershing asked for a larger-caliber machine gun. Pershing asked the Army Ordnance Department to develop a machine gun with a caliber of at least and a muzzle velocity of at least .

Around July 1917, John Browning started redesigning his .30-06 M1917 machine gun for a larger and more powerful round. Winchester worked on the cartridge, which was a scaled-up version of the .30-06. Winchester initially added a rim to the cartridge because the company wanted to use the cartridge in an anti-tank rifle, but Pershing insisted the cartridge be rimless. The first .50-caliber machine gun underwent trials on 15 October 1918. It fired at less than 500 rounds per minute, and the muzzle velocity was only . Cartridge improvements were promised. The gun was heavy, difficult to control, fired too slowly for the anti-personnel role, and was not powerful enough against armor.

While the .50-caliber was being developed, some 13.2×92mmSR Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr anti-tank rifles and their ammunition were captured. The 13.2 mm German rounds had a muzzle velocity of , an bullet, and could penetrate armor thick at a range of . Winchester improved the .50 caliber round to have similar performance. Ultimately, the muzzle velocity was .

Efforts by Browning and Fred T. Moore resulted in the water-cooled, .50 caliber M1921 Browning machine gun and an aircraft version. These guns were used experimentally from 1921 until 1937. They had lightweight barrels and the ammunition fed only from the left side. Service trials raised doubts about whether the guns would be suitable for aircraft or for anti-aircraft use. A heavy barrel M1921 was considered for ground vehicles.

John M. Browning died in 1926. Between 1927 and 1932, S. H. Green studied the design problems of the M1921 and the needs of the armed services. The result was a single receiver design that could be turned into seven types of .50 caliber machine guns by using different jackets, barrels, and other components. The new receiver allowed right or left side feed. In 1933, Colt manufactured several prototype Browning machine guns (including what would be known as the M1921A1 and M1921E2). With support from the Navy, Colt started manufacturing the M2 in 1933. FN Herstal (Fabrique Nationale) has manufactured the M2 machine gun since the 1930s. General Dynamics, U.S. Ordnance and Ohio Ordnance Works Inc. are other current manufacturers.

A variant without a water jacket, but with a thicker-walled, air-cooled barrel was designated the M2 HB (&quot;HB&quot; for &quot;Heavy Barrel&quot;). The added mass and surface area of the heavy barrel compensated somewhat for the loss of water-cooling, while reducing bulk and weight: the M2 weighs with a water jacket, but the M2 HB weighs . Due to the long procedure for changing the barrel, an improved system was developed called QCB (quick change barrel). The lightweight &quot;Army/Navy&quot; prefixed AN/M2 &quot;light-barrel&quot; version of the Browning M2 weighing was also developed, and became the standard .50-caliber aviation machine gun of the World War II–era for American military aircraft of nearly every type, readily replacing Browning&#x27;s own air-cooled .30 caliber machine gun design in nearly all American aircraft installations.

==Design details==
The Browning M2 is an air-cooled, belt-fed machine gun. The M2 fires from a closed bolt, operated on the short recoil principle. The M2 fires the .50 BMG cartridge, which offers longer range, greater accuracy, and immense stopping power. The closed bolt firing cycle made the M2 usable as a synchronized machine gun on aircraft before and during World War II, as on the early versions of the Curtiss P-40 fighter. The M2 is a scaled-up version of John Browning&#x27;s M1917 .30 caliber machine gun.

===Features===
The M2 has varying cyclic rates of fire, depending on the model. The M2HB air-cooled ground gun has a cyclical rate of 450–575 rounds per minute. The early M2 water-cooled AA guns had a cyclical rate of around 450–600 rpm. The AN/M2 aircraft gun has a cyclic rate of 750–850 rpm; this increases to 1,200 rpm for AN/M3 aircraft guns. These maximum rates of fire are generally not achieved in use, as sustained fire at that rate will wear out the bore within a few thousand rounds, necessitating replacement. In addition to full automatic, the M2HB can be selected to fire single shots, fire slowly at less than 40 rounds per minute, or fire rapidly for more than 40 rounds per minute. Slow and rapid firing modes use 5–7 round bursts with different lengths of pause between bursts.
The M2 has an effective range of and a maximum effective range of when fired from the M3 tripod. In its ground-portable, crew-served role as the M2HB, the gun itself weighs and the assembled M3 tripod another . In this configuration, the V-shaped &quot;butterfly&quot; trigger is located at the very rear of the weapon with a &quot;spade handle&quot; handgrip on either side of it and the bolt release in the center. The spade handles are gripped and the butterfly trigger is depressed with one or both thumbs. Recently, new rear buffer assemblies have used squeeze triggers mounted to the handgrips, doing away with the butterfly triggers.

When the bolt release is locked down by the bolt latch release lock on the buffer tube sleeve, the gun functions in fully automatic mode. Conversely, the bolt release can be unlocked into the up position resulting in single-shot firing (the gunner must press the bolt latch release to send the bolt forward). Unlike virtually all other modern machine guns, it has no safety (although a sliding safety switch has recently been fielded to USMC armorers for installation on their weapons and is standard-issue for the U.S. Army for all M2s). Troops in the field have been known to add an improvised safety measure against accidental firing by slipping an expended shell casing under the butterfly trigger. The upgraded M2A1 has a manual trigger block safety.
Because the M2 was designed to operate in many configurations, it can be adapted to feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and rear cartridge stops (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch. The operator must also convert the top-cover belt feed slide assembly from left to right-hand feed as well as the spring and plunger in the feed arm. This will take a well-trained individual less than two minutes to perform.

The charging assembly may be changed from left to right-hand charge. A right-hand charging handle spring, lock wire, and a little &quot;know-how&quot; are all that is required to accomplish this. The M2 can be battle-ready and easily interchanged if it is preemptively fitted with a retracting slide assembly on both sides of the weapon system. This eliminates the need to have the weapon removed from service to accomplish this task.

At some point during World War II, the Frankford Arsenal developed a squeeze bore version of the M2HB which reduced the bullet size from .50 to .30 caliber.

===Ammunition===
There are several different types of ammunition used in the M2HB and AN aircraft guns. From World War II through the Vietnam War, the Browning was used with standard ball, armor-piercing (AP), armor-piercing incendiary (API), and armor-piercing incendiary tracer (APIT) rounds. All .50 ammunition designated &quot;armor-piercing&quot; was required to completely perforate of hardened steel armor plate at a distance of and at . The API and APIT rounds left a flash, report, and smoke on contact, useful in detecting strikes on enemy targets; they were primarily intended to incapacitate thin-skinned and lightly armored vehicles and aircraft, while igniting their fuel tanks.

Current ammunition types include M33 Ball (706.7 grain) for personnel and light material targets, M17 tracer, M8 API (622.5 grain), M20 API-T (619 grain), and M962 SLAP-T. The latter ammunition along with the M903 SLAP (Saboted Light Armor Penetrator) round can perforate of FHA (face-hardened steel plate) at , at , and at . This is achieved by using a tungsten penetrator. The SLAP-T adds a tracer charge to the base of the ammunition. This ammunition was type classified in 1993.
When firing blanks, a large blank-firing adapter (BFA) of a special type must be used to allow the recoil-operated action to cycle. This functions on the principle of a recoil booster, to increase the recoil force acting on the short recoil action. This is the exact antithesis of a muzzle brake. Without this adaptor, the reduced-charge blank cartridge would develop too little recoil to cycle the action fully. The adapter is very distinctive, attaching to the muzzle with three rods extending back to the base. The BFA can often be seen on M2s during peacetime operations.

==Deployment==


The M2 .50 Browning machine gun has been used for various roles:
* A medium infantry support weapon
* As a light anti-aircraft (AA) gun in some ships; up to six M2 guns could be mounted on the same turret.
* As an anti-aircraft gun on the ground. The original water-cooled version of the M2 was used on a tall AA tripod or vehicle-mounted anti-aircraft weapon on pedestal mount. In later variants, twin and quadruple M2HB Brownings were used, such as the M45 Quadmount (aka &quot;meat chopper&quot;) used on the US M16 half-track carrier. Twin or quad-mount .50 M2 guns normally used alternating left-hand and right-hand feed.
* Primary or secondary weapon on an armored fighting vehicle.
* Primary or secondary weapon on a naval patrol boat.
* Spotting for the primary weapon on some armored fighting vehicles.
* Secondary weapon for anti-boat defense on large naval vessels (corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers, etc.).
* Coaxial gun or independent mounting in some tanks, including but not limited to: the M47 Patton, M48 Patton, M4 Sherman, M24 Chaffee, Heavy tank M6, Heavy Tank T29, M1 Abrams, M60 Patton, M46 Patton, and the M26 Pershing.
* Fixed-mounted forward-firing primary aircraft armament (AN/M2 and AN/M3 light-barrel versions only). The AN/M2 was used as primary armament in almost all World War II U.S. pursuit aircraft (such as the North American P-51 Mustang, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Grumman F6F Hellcat, and Vought F4U Corsair). It was also used in fixed mountings in bombers and ground attack aircraft like the Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber, Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, and medium bombers such as North American B-25 Mitchell, Martin B-26 Marauder, and Douglas A-26 Invader; usually 4–8 per aircraft but the bombers could mount 12 or more in certain configurations. The later, faster-firing electrically feed-boosted AN/M3 was used in many Korean War–era USAF fighter aircraft such as the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star, Republic F-84 Thunderjet, North American F-86 Sabre, and early versions of the Martin B-57 Canberra bomber. The US Navy had largely completed their move to the (unrelated) M2/AN 20 mm autocannon for aircraft armament by this time.
* Turret-mount or flexible-mounted defensive armament, again only with the AN/M2 light-barrel version, in almost all US World War II–era bombers and patrol aircraft such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers, North American B-25 Mitchell and Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers, Consolidated PBY Catalina patrol flying boats, Goodyear K- and M-class blimps, Grumman TBF/TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, and in a combined offensive/defensive turret mounting in many Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighters. The AN/M3 was used as a flexible, quad-mounted, radar-directed tail-defense gun as late as 1980 on the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, until replaced by 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling-type cannon on the H model.
* Variants of the AN/M3 are used as flexible door guns or as flexible remotely-controlled armament subsystems on many US Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard helicopters, such as the Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk and variants, Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion, Bell OH-58 Kiowa, and others.

===United States===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, the United States had versions of the M2 in service as fixed aircraft guns, anti-aircraft defensive guns (on aircraft, ships, or boats), infantry (tripod-mounted) guns, and as dual purpose anti-aircraft and anti-vehicular weapons on vehicles.

The .50 AN/M2 light-barrel aircraft Browning used in planes had a rate of fire of approximately 800 rounds per minute and was used singly or in groups of up to eight guns for aircraft ranging from the P-47 Thunderbolt to the B-25 Mitchell bomber, which in the last J-version of the Mitchell could have up to fourteen M2s firing forward for ground attack missions – eight in a solid metal-structure nose, four more mounted in a pair of conformal twin-gunned gun pods on the lower cockpit sides, and two more if the forward dorsal turret&#x27;s pair of M2 guns were also aimed straight forward. The later A-26 bested this with up to a maximum of 16/18 machine guns, 8 in the nose, four more per wing in flush-mount pods, plus 2 guns in the dorsal turret.

In the dual-purpose vehicle mount, the M2HB proved extremely effective in U.S. service: the Browning&#x27;s .50 caliber AP and API rounds could easily penetrate the engine block or fuel tanks of a German Bf 109 fighter attacking at low altitude, or perforate the hull plates and fuel tanks of a German half-track or light armored car. It could even penetrate the sides and rear of the Panzer I, Panzer II, Panzer III, and Panzer IV tanks. While the dual-purpose mounting was undeniably useful, it did normally require the operator to stand when using the M2 in a ground role, exposing him to return fire. Units in the field often modified the mountings on their vehicles, especially tanks and tank destroyers, to provide more operator protection in the anti-vehicular and anti-personnel role. The weapon was particularly hated by the Germans, whose attacks and ambushes against otherwise helpless stalled motor convoys were frequently broken up by .50 caliber machine gun fire. Vehicles would frequently &quot;recon by fire&quot; with the M2 Browning, i.e. they would fire continuously at suspected points of ambush while moving through areas still containing enemy forces. One vehicle would fire exclusively to the right, the following vehicle to the left, the next one to the right, and so on in order to cover both flanks of the advancing convoy.

Besides vehicle-mounted weapons, the heavy weapons companies in a World War II U.S. Army infantry battalion or regiment were each issued one M2 Browning with tripod (ground) mount. Mounted on a heavily sandbagged tripod, the M2HB proved very useful in either a defensive role or to interdict or block road intersections from use by German infantry and motorized forces. Hearing the sound of an M2 could often cause enemy infantry to take cover. There are numerous instances of the M2 Browning being used against enemy personnel, particularly infantry assaults or for interdiction or elimination of enemy artillery observers or snipers at distances too great for ordinary infantry weapons.
The M2HB was not widely used in the Pacific campaign for several reasons, including the weight of the gun, the nature of infantry jungle combat, and because road intersections were usually easily outflanked. However, it was used by fast-moving motorized forces in the Philippines to destroy Japanese blocking units on the advance to Manila. The quad mount .50 was also used to destroy Japanese emplacements.

The M2HB was used in Korea and Vietnam, and later in both Operation Desert Storm, the Afghan theater of Operation Enduring Freedom and in Iraq. In 2003, U.S. Army SFC Paul Ray Smith used his M2HB mounted on an M113 armored personnel carrier to kill 20 to 50 enemies who were attacking a U.S. outpost, preventing an aid station from being overrun and allowing wounded soldiers to be evacuated, SFC Smith was killed during the firefight and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

====M45 Quadmount====

The M45 Quadmount was a mounting of four .50 M2HB guns with a single gunner situated behind an armored housing. This was used by U.S. anti-air battalions, fitted either on a towed trailer or mounted on a half-track carrier. With 200 rounds per gun in a powered tracking mount, the guns proved very effective against low-flying aircraft. The use of four guns adequately compensated for the fact that the individual M2HB&#x27;s rate of fire (450–550 rounds per minute) was low for an effective anti-aircraft weapon.

Towards the end of the war, as Luftwaffe attacks became less frequent, the quad .50 (nicknamed the &quot;Meat Chopper&quot; or &quot;Krautmower&quot;) was increasingly used in an anti-personnel role, similarly to the earlier-introduced (1940) and more powerful—but much more difficult to keep well-fed with ammunition when in action—German 20 mm Flakvierling. Snipers firing from trees were engaged by the quad gunner at trunk level; the weapon would cut down and destroy the entire tree, and the sniper with it.

The M45 Quadmount was still in use during the Vietnam War.

===Commonwealth and other forces===

The Commonwealth use of the M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun (known as the .5 Browning in British and Commonwealth service) began in World War II, though from 1942 it was standard armament on US-built AFVs provided under lend-lease such as the M4 Sherman, M7 Priest, M8 Greyhound, or M10 tank destroyer variously used by British, Canadian, Australian, South African, and New Zealand units. Nevertheless, the heavy Browning&#x27;s effectiveness was praised by many British and Commonwealth soldiers in infantry, armored, and ordnance branches. Many commanders thought that the .50 Browning was the best weapon in its class, certainly the best of the American weapons, including the M1 Garand and M1 Carbine. In North Africa, after Commonwealth units began to obtain sufficient parts, manuals, gauges, and ammunition for the new weapon, the .50 Browning was increasingly used, eventually replacing the 15 mm Besa, but in Italy it was often deleted from top turret mountings because the mount exposed the operator to low branches and enemy fire. All LRDGs, and some SAS units used the aircraft (AN/M2) version of the gun, while beam/waist-mounted and turret-mounted Brownings were used later in the war in such aircraft as the Short Sunderland and Lancaster bomber.

After World War II, the .50 Browning continued to see action in Korea and other theaters, in aircraft, tripod (ground), ground AA (hip-ring), and vehicle mounts. One of its most notable actions in a ground role was in a fierce battle with a nine-man Special Air Service team at the Battle of Mirbat in Oman in July 1972, where the heavy Browning and its API ammunition was used to help repulse an assault by 250 Yemeni Adoo guerrillas, though the more famous weapon from the battle is a 25 pounder gun. The Scots Guards used the weapon in the 1982 Falklands War.

A .50 caliber Browning was installed along with a .30 caliber Browning machine gun in each compact one-man turret on M113 APCs used by the Royal Australian Armoured Corps in South Vietnam.

The M2HB has been in service with the Israel Defense Forces since its establishment and has served in all of Israel&#x27;s wars, operations, and conflicts. In 2012, the IDF upgraded its M2HB machine guns to the M2HQCB model, with a heavy quick-change barrel. Today the M2 serves as an infantry crew-served heavy machine gun, as a remote-controlled external coaxial gun on Merkava main battle tanks, as the main weapon on the Samson RCWS, and as a secondary weapon on Israeli Sea Corps gunboats and missile boats.

Nigerian troops have extensively deployed the 50 caliber Browning, mounted on Otokar Cobra APCs, Panhard VBL M11s and Landcruiser gun-trucks in counterinsurgency operations in the Niger Delta, N.E Nigeria, the Jos Plateau, and in Mali.

===Japanese Usage ===
==== Use by the Imperial Japanese Military ==== 

During the Pacific War, the Empire of Japan, engaged in combat with the United States, made extensive use of M2 Browning-style machine guns and their modified versions, including fixed and swivel-mounted aircraft guns, primarily by the Imperial Army&#x27;s air forces.

* Ho-103: The Imperial Japanese Army adopted the Type 103 (Ishiki Jūni-7mm Kōkū Kikō) machine gun, a modified version of the AN/M2 (MG53-2) aircraft-mounted variant of the M2 Browning, changing the caliber to 12.7x81mmSR to match the Breda SAFAT 12.7mm heavy machine gun’s standard. This weapon was widely equipped on Army fighter planes, including the early to mid-period Pacific War aircraft like the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Compared to the M2, the Ho-103 was smaller, lighter, and had a higher rate of fire, but its reduced projectile weight meant it had lower power and muzzle velocity (though it could fire high-explosive “Ma-dan” shells, a feature the M2 lacked). While the M2 was relatively large and heavy for an aircraft gun, the Ho-103 succeeded in keeping weight down.

* Ho-5: The Army also pursued the development of a higher-powered 20mm cannon, which led to the creation of the Ho-5 (Type 2 20mm Fixed Aircraft Cannon), a 20mm version based on the Ho-103 design. The Ho-5 was equipped on later-stage Army fighters such as the Kawanishi N1K-J Shiden. The Ho-5 was nearly the same size and weight as the M2, despite its larger caliber, and offered excellent rate of fire, muzzle velocity, and devastating power.

* Type 3 13mm Fixed Machine Gun: The Imperial Japanese Navy also adopted a variant based on the M2, the Type 3 13mm Fixed Machine Gun, which used a 13mm cartridge (13.2x96mm) and the barrel of the Type 93 13mm heavy machine gun from the Hotchkiss family. This was mounted on a small number of Navy fighter planes, such as the A6M5b Zero, which appeared in the late stages of World War II. While the Type 3 had similar size and weight to the M2, it had superior rate of fire and a heavier bullet, giving it higher firepower per shot. However, its muzzle velocity was lower compared to the M2.

==== Post-World War II Use ==== 
After World War II, as Japan began rearming, the M2 was initially supplied by the United States. In addition to these supplied units, Sumitomo Heavy Industries began license production at its Tanashi factory in 1984.

In the Japan Self-Defense Forces, the 12.7mm Heavy Machine Gun M2 (12.7mm重機関銃M2) is primarily used in vehicles such as tanks, self-propelled guns, and armored vehicles, as well as for anti-aircraft purposes. New procurement includes approximately 80 units annually, and the M3 mount is compatible with the Type 96 40mm automatic grenade launcher. When deployed on the ground as anti-aircraft weapons, the M63 anti-aircraft mount is used. The procurement price is approximately ¥5.3 million.

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force initially equipped early destroyers and patrol vessels with several M2 machine guns. However, these were eventually phased out due to concerns over their insufficient power and short range. In response to incidents involving North Korean suspicious ships, the M2 machine guns were reintroduced on some vessels as more appropriate firepower for engaging small targets. The M2 is not considered a standard weapon on ships but is treated as an installed weapon (see :ja:海上自衛隊の個人装備)

The Japan Air Self-Defense Force also used the M2 machine gun in the M55 trailer-mounted anti-aircraft gun for base defense purposes. However, with the introduction of newer systems like the VADS, the M2 is no longer in active combat use and is stored as a reserve.

The Japan Coast Guard has also used the M2 since its inception, referring to it as the 13mm Machine Gun and equipping many patrol boats with it. The weapon is still in use on patrol ships and boats today.

In December 2013, Sumitomo Heavy Industries was found to have falsified test data for at least 5,000 units of various machine guns, including the 5.56mm Machine Gun MINIMI, Type 74 Vehicle Mounted 7.62mm Machine Gun and the M2HB, and was placed under a five-month suspension.

In April 2021, Sumitomo Heavy Industries announced it would cease production of machine guns, although it intends to continue manufacturing parts for maintenance and repairs.

===Sniper rifle===
The M2 machine gun has also been used as a long-range sniper rifle when equipped with a high-powered telescopic sight. Soldiers during the Korean War used scoped M2s in the role of a sniper rifle, but the practice was most notably used by US Marine Corps sniper Carlos Hathcock during the Vietnam War. Using an Unertl telescopic sight and a mounting bracket of his own design, Hathcock could quickly convert the M2 into a sniper rifle, using the traversing-and-elevating (T&amp;E) mechanism attached to the tripod. When firing semi-automatically, Hathcock hit man-size targets beyond —twice the range of the standard-caliber sniper rifle of the time (a .30-06 Winchester Model 70). Hathcock set the record for the longest confirmed kill at , a record which stood until 2002, when it was broken in Afghanistan by Canadian Army sniper Arron Perry.

===Variants===
The basic M2 was deployed in U.S. service in a number of subvariants, all with separate complete designations as per the US Army system. The basic designation as mentioned in the introduction is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, with others as described below.

The development of the M1921 water-cooled machine gun which led to the M2, meant that the initial M2s were, in fact, water-cooled. These weapons were designated Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, Water-Cooled, Flexible. There was no fixed water-cooled version.

Improved air-cooled heavy barrel versions came in three subtypes. The basic infantry model, Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible, a fixed developed for use on the M6 Heavy Tank designated Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Fixed, and a &quot;turret type&quot; whereby &quot;Flexible&quot; M2s were modified slightly for use in tank turrets. The subvariant designation Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, TT was only used for manufacturing, supply, and administration identification and separation from flexible M2s.

A number of additional subvariants were developed after the end of World War II. The M2 Heavy Barrel, M48 Turret Type was developed for the commander&#x27;s cupola on the M48 Patton tank. The cupola mount on the M48A2 and M48A3 was thoroughly disliked by most tankers, as it proved unreliable in service. An externally mounted M2 was later adopted for the commander&#x27;s position on the M1 Abrams tanks. Three subvariants were also developed for use by the U.S. Navy on a variety of ships and watercraft including the soft mount and fixed type versions. The fixed types fire from a solenoid trigger and come in left- or right-hand feed variants for use on the Mk 56 Mod 0 dual mount and other mounts.

Huaqing Machinery has made a clone of the M2HB known as the CS/LM6, which was released publicly in 2010 at foreign weapons expo conventions. It was made with a picatinny rail on the receiver in order to have quick installation of various optics. The original M2HB tripod and parts can be used on the CS/LM6.

===M2A1===
When the M2 was first being designed, John Browning faced two design challenges. With the machine tools available at that time, the dimensions that established the location of the bolt face and the depth of the chamber could not be held tightly enough to control the fit of the cartridge in the chamber. The round can be too tight in the chamber and the gun would not fire, or be too loose in the chamber, resulting in a stoppage or ruptured cartridge. The other dimension that could not be held closely enough was when the firing pin would fall. The solution to these problems was adjustable timing and headspace (&quot;Timing&quot; is the adjustment of the gun so that firing takes place when the recoiling parts are in the correct position for firing; &quot;headspace&quot; is the distance between the face of the bolt and the base of the cartridge case, fully seated in the chamber); the operator had to screw the barrel into the barrel extension, moving the barrel toward the bolt face to reach the proper headspace with simple gauges to allow the operator to adjust to the proper dimensions. By the late 20th century, the M2 was the only adjustable headspace weapon in the U.S. inventory. With rising reports of injuries from improperly headspaced weapons, the U.S. military held a competition for a quick change barrel conversion kit with fixed timing and headspace in 1997. Three companies offered kits and Saco Defense won the competition. However, funding was lost before the design could be fully evaluated and the program ended. In 2007, the military found money to start a new competition. Saco Defense had since been acquired by General Dynamics, which won the competition.
On 15 October 2010, the &quot;M2A1&quot; heavy machine gun was type classified by the U.S. Army. Formerly known as the M2E2, the M2A1 incorporates improvements to the design including a quick change barrel (QCB) with a removable carrying handle, a new slotted flash suppressor that reduces muzzle flash by 95 percent, fixed headspace and timing, a modified bolt, and a manual trigger block safety. When a standard M2 had a barrel change, the headspace and timing had to be manually set. Improper adjustment could damage the weapon and cause serious injury to the user. Fixed headspace and timing reduces risk, and the carrying handle allows the barrel to be switched in seconds. In June 2011, the Army began conversion of M2HB machine guns to M2A1s. The M2A1 was named one of the greatest Army inventions of 2011. As of 30 November 2012, 8,300 built or converted M2A1s had been fielded by the U.S. Army; the program will upgrade the Army&#x27;s entire M2 inventory of more than 54,000 guns. The U.S. Marine Corps plans to upgrade all of their ground-mounted M2s to M2A1 standard from 2016 to 2018. The first phase of conversions was completed in March 2017, with 3,600 M2A1s planned to be fielded by the Marines in total. The Israel Defense Forces adopted the M2-HQCB (the commercial version of the M2A1) in 2012 as a replacement to the M2HB.

=== 13,2 mm FN Browning ===
One derivative of the M2 Browning is the Mitrailleuse d´Avion Browning - F.N. Calibre 13,2 mm, more commonly known as the FN Browning M.1939. The FN Browning M.1939 was a heavily modified M2 Browning for aircraft use designed by FN Herstal for export. Their aim was to make a light, reliable heavy machine gun with the same damage output as a 20 mm autocannon. To achieve this, they raised the firing rate to 1080 rpm and gave it a more powerful cartridge in the form of the 13.2×99mm Hotchkiss. This cartridge was a popular Eurasian analog of .50 BMG developed independently in 1920s with a 13.2 mm bullet (.52 in) and more propellant. A new projectile was designed for this gun. It was of a high explosive type and was designed to take down a small aircraft with a single hit. Tests showed that it was very effective against both cloth and aluminum skinned aircraft.

Due to the aforementioned improvements, the gun received interest from numerous nations when it entered the export market in 1939. Due to the start of World War 2 and the invasion of Belgium it was exported to only Romania and Sweden. Sweden was able to buy the majority of the weapons along with the blueprints to produce the weapon on their own without paying for a license. In Sweden, the weapon received the designation Automatkanon m/39, short Akan m/39, meaning Autocannon m/39 and was later produced by Ericsson as the Akan m/39A. Sweden also gave the blueprints to Finland so they could produce the weapon. Since Finland was already producing 12.7 mm ammunition, the Finnish variant was rechambered to 12.7 mm (.50 BMG). The Finnish variant was designated VKT 12,70 LKk/42 and was produced by Finland.

==Aircraft guns==

=== .50 Browning AN/M2 ===

The M2 heavy machine gun was widely used during World War II, and in later postwar conflicts, as a remote or flexible aircraft gun. For fixed (offensive) or flexible (defensive) guns used in aircraft, a dedicated M2 version was developed called the &quot;.50 Browning AN/M2&quot; or the &quot;12.7 mm AN/M2&quot;. The &quot;AN&quot; stands for &quot;Army/Navy&quot;, since the gun was developed jointly for use by both services. The AN/M2 designation was also used for other aircraft guns and therefore it is important to write the caliber before the designation.

The 12.7 mm AN/M2 had a cyclic rate of 600–800 rounds per minute, with the ability to be fired from an electrically operated remote-mount solenoid trigger when installed as a fixed gun. Cooled by the aircraft&#x27;s slip-stream, the air-cooled 12.7 mm AN/M2 was fitted with a substantially lighter length barrel, reducing the weight of the complete unit to , which also had the effect of increasing the rate of fire. The full official designation for this weapon was &quot;Browning Machine Gun, Aircraft, Cal. .50, AN/M2&quot; (Fixed) or (Flexible).

The 12.7 mm AN/M2 was used on many aircraft during WWII, as it served as the main aircraft armament in the US military. Most US fighter aircraft were armed with four, six or eight AN/M2 MGs mounted in the wings. Some examples being the Curtiss P-40, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, and North American P-51 Mustang for the USAAF and the F4F, F6F, and Vought F4U Corsair for the US Navy. For bombers, the AN/M2 was used in both flexible and fixed positions for both offensive and defensive use. In flexible defensive positions, the Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress heavy bomber was armed with 13x AN/M2 guns in both turreted and flexible positions. In fixed offensive configurations, like on the North American B-25 Mitchell, commonly carried 6 to 12 fixed guns for strafing.

In foreign use the AN/M2 is often just referred to as the M2 Browning. In Sweden it was re-designated 12,7 mm automatkanon m/45 (short &quot;12.7mm akan m/45&quot;) meaning 12.7 mm autocannon m/45. The Swedish Air Force used a different designation system which recognized the incendiary rounds as grenades, thus it was called autocannon. The AN/M2 was also produced in Finland under the export name Colt MG 53-2.

===M296===
The XM296/M296 is a further development of the AN/M2 machine gun for the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter. The M296 differs from previous remote firing variants in that it has an adjustable firing rate (500–850 rpm), while lacking a bolt latch (allowing single-shot operation). As an air-cooled gun used aboard a relatively slow rotary-wing aircraft, the M296 has a burst restriction rate of 50 rounds per minute sustained fire or 150 rounds per minute maximum while conducting peacetime training requirements; the combat firing rate is unrestricted but a ten-minute cooling period after prolonged firing is mandated to avoid stoppages due to overheating.

===XM213/M213, XM218, GAU-15/A, GAU-16/A, and GAU-18/A===

The XM213/M213 was a modernization and adaptation of existing .50 caliber AN/M2s in inventory for use as a pintle-mounted door gun on helicopters using the M59 armament subsystem.

The GAU-15/A, formerly identified as the XM218, is a lightweight member of the M2/M3 family. The GAU-16/A was an improved GAU-15/A with modified grip and sight assemblies for similar applications. Both of these weapons were used as a part of the A/A49E-11 armament subsystem (also known as the Defensive Armament System).

The GAU-18/A is a lightweight variant of the M2/M3 and is used on the USAF&#x27;s MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. These weapons use the M2HB barrel and are typically set up as left-hand feed, right-hand charging weapons, but on the HH-60 Pave Hawks that use the EGMS (External Gun Mount System) the gun is isolated from the shooter by a recoil-absorbing cradle and all weapons are set up as right-hand charge but vary between left- and right-hand feed depending on what side of the aircraft it is on. A feed chute adapter is attached to the left- or right-hand feed pawl bracket allowing the weapon to receive ammunition through a feed chute system connected to externally mounted ammunition containers holding 600 rounds each.

===AN/M3, GAU-21/A, and M3P===

During World War II, a faster-firing Browning was developed for aircraft use. The &quot;AN/M3&quot; increased the rate of fire to around 1,200 rounds per minute while firing the same round with minimal change in weight or size. The AN/M3 was used in Korea on the F-82 Twin Mustang (the XP-82 mounted a total of 14 AN/M3 machine guns), F-86 Sabre, F-84 Thunderjet, and F-80 Shooting Star, and in Vietnam in the XM14/SUU-12/A gun pod. Two are installed in the Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano aircraft as a fixed wing-mounted standard weapon as designated as M3W with minor modification with reduced weight barrel, electronic box triggered from the cockpit with 250 rounds each.
The M3 series is used by the U.S. military in two versions, the M3M and M3P. The fixed, remote-firing version, the FN &quot;M3P&quot;, is employed on the Avenger Air Defense System and was used on the OH-58D, augmenting the XM296 .50 cal. machine gun. The FN &quot;M3M&quot; flexible machine gun has been adopted by the U.S. Navy under the designation GAU-21/A for use on helicopters. The GAU-21/A is also being used by the U.S. Marine Corps to upgrade from the XM-218/GAU-16 .50 cal. machine gun for the CH-53E, on the UH-1Y Venom, on the Canadian Forces&#x27; CH-146 Griffon via the INGRESS upgrade and is to be used on the CH-53K. The Air Force is looking to replace the GAU-18 on the HH-60G Pave Hawk with the GAU-21 because of its higher 1,100 rpm rate of fire, longer 10,000-round barrel life, and lower recoil through the use of a soft mount. The M3M is also the primary machine gun used by the British Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm for helicopter armament on Wildcat and Merlin aircraft. It is also used by the German Bundeswehr on their NH-90 helicopters.

==Myths regarding M2 Browning use against personnel==
It is often stated in military circles that the use of the M2 Browning against human targets is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. This is false; the Geneva Convention, contrary to popular belief, does not regulate the use of any weapon of war. It only regulates the treatment and protection of prisoners of war and non-combatants. There has been controversy surrounding the use of .50 caliber ammunition against enemy personnel, due to the explosive and incendiary Raufoss Mk 211 ammunition. The Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 states that the &quot;military or naval&quot; use of explosive or incendiary projectiles with a mass of under is forbidden by its signatory parties.

The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which are the international treaties that do regulate the use of weaponry, do not prohibit the use of .50 caliber weapons like the M2 against personnel. The US Army&#x27;s own field manual concerning the employment of the M2 actually describes enemy personnel as an intended target. The origin of these myths is likely due to military commanders instructing their troops to conserve ammunition for targets that other lighter machine guns were not well suited to engage, such as aircraft or ground vehicles. One possible source of the misconception is from World War II, when American half-track units in Germany were told to stop firing their M2s at ground targets, to conserve ammunition in case of a Luftwaffe attack. Also, U.S. troops were told to use their M2s only against enemy equipment due to shortages of ammunition during the Korean or Vietnam War. It is also possible that a restriction during the latter period limiting the use of the M40 recoilless rifle&#x27;s .50-caliber spotting gun to destroy enemy equipment only, since the M40 was meant to be used against armor and firing it at personnel would give away their position before it could be used as intended, was mistakenly applied to all .50 caliber weapons.

<text>The .50 BMG (.50 Browning Machine Gun), also known as 12.7×99mm NATO, and designated as the 50 Browning by the C.I.P., is a caliber cartridge developed for the M2 Browning heavy machine gun in the late 1910s, entering official service in 1921. Under STANAG 4383, it is a standard service cartridge for NATO forces. The cartridge itself has been made in many variants: multiple generations of regular ball, tracer, armor-piercing (AP), incendiary, and saboted sub-caliber penetrator rounds. The rounds intended for machine guns are made into a continuous ammunition belt using metallic links.

The .50 BMG cartridge is also used in anti-materiel rifles. A wide variety of ammunition is available, and the availability of match grade ammunition has increased the usefulness of .50 caliber rifles by allowing more accurate fire than lower-quality rounds.

==History==
In response to the need for new anti-aircraft weaponry during World War I, John Browning developed the .50 BMG. He wanted the round to be used in a machine gun based on a scaled-up version of the M1917 Browning.

The development of the .50 BMG round is sometimes confused with the German 13.2 mm TuF, which was developed by Germany for an anti-tank rifle to combat British tanks during World War I and against aircraft. According to &quot;American Rifleman&quot;: &quot;Actually, the Browning .50 originated in the Great War. American interest in an armor-piercing cartridge was influenced by the marginal French design, prompting U.S. Army Ordnance officers to consult Browning. They wanted a heavy projectile at , but the ammunition did not exist. Browning pondered the situation and, according to his son John, replied, &#x27;Well, the cartridge sounds pretty good to start. You make up some cartridges and we&#x27;ll do some shooting.&#x27;&quot;

The &quot;American Rifleman&quot; further explains that development was &quot;[r]eputedly influenced by Germany&#x27;s 13.2x92 mm SR (.525 in) anti-tank rifle&quot; and that then &quot;Ordnance contracted with Winchester to design a .50-cal. cartridge. Subsequently, Frankford Arsenal took over from Winchester, producing the historic .50 BMG (12.7×99 mm) cartridge. The Army then returned to John Browning for the actual gun. Teamed with Colt, he produced prototypes ready for testing and, ironically, completed them by Nov. 11, 1918—the Great War&#x27;s end.&quot;

The round was put into use in the M1921 Browning machine gun. This gun was later developed into the M2HB Browning, which, with its .50 caliber armor-piercing cartridges, went on to function as an anti-aircraft and anti-vehicular machine gun, capable of penetrating of face-hardened armor steel plate at , of rolled homogeneous armor at the same range, and at .

During World War II the .50 BMG was primarily used in the M2 Browning machine gun, in both its &quot;light barrel&quot; aircraft mount version and the &quot;heavy barrel&quot; (HB) version on ground vehicles, for anti-aircraft purposes. An upgraded variant of the M2 Browning HB machine gun used during World War II is still in use today. Since the mid-1950s, some armored personnel carriers and utility vehicles have been made to withstand 12.7 mm machine gun fire, restricting the destructive capability of the M2. It still has more penetrating power than lighter weapons such as general-purpose machine guns, though it is significantly heavier and more cumbersome to transport. Its range and accuracy, however, are superior to light machine guns when fixed on tripods, and it has not been replaced as the standard caliber for Western vehicle-mounted machine guns (Soviet and CIS armored vehicles mount 12.7×108mm NSVs, which have similar dimensions to .50 BMGs).

Decades later, the .50 BMG was chambered in high-powered rifles as well. The Barrett M82 rifle was developed during the 1980s and, along with later variants, has upgraded the anti-materiel power of the military sniper.

==Typical uses==
The primary military use of this round is in the M2 Browning machine gun and anti-materiel rifles such as the Barrett M82.

The U.S. Coast Guard uses .50 BMG rifles onboard armed helicopters to disable the engines on boats during interdictions. Similarly, .50 BMG weapons have attracted attention from law enforcement agencies; they have been adopted by the New York City Police Department as well as the Pittsburgh Police. A .50 BMG round can effectively disable a vehicle when fired into the engine block. A .50 BMG round will penetrate most commercial brick walls and concrete cinder blocks.

The .50 BMG round was used as a sniper round as early as the Korean War. The former record for a confirmed long-distance kill was set by U.S. Marine sniper Carlos Hathcock in 1967 during the Vietnam War, at a distance of ; Hathcock used the .50 BMG in an M2 machine gun equipped with a telescopic sight. This weapon was used by other snipers, and eventually purpose-built sniper rifles were developed specifically for this round.

In June 2017, a McMillan TAC-50 was used by a sniper with Canada&#x27;s Joint Task Force 2 to kill an Islamic State insurgent in Iraq, setting the new world record for the longest confirmed kill shot in military history at . Before that, a British sniper in Afghanistan held the record at using an Accuracy International AWM L115A3 long-range rifle chambered for .338 Lapua Magnum (8.58×70 mm) rounds.

In addition to long-range and anti-materiel, the U.S. military uses .50 BMG weapons to detonate unexploded ordnance from a safe distance. It can disable most unarmored and lightly armored vehicles.

Some civilians use .50 caliber rifles for long-range target shooting: the US-based Fifty Caliber Shooters Association holds .50 BMG shooting matches.

==Cartridge dimensions==

The .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) cartridge has a capacity of . The round is a scaled-up version of the .30-06 Springfield but uses a case wall with a long taper to facilitate feeding and extraction in various weapons.

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 1 in , with eight lands and grooves. The primer type specified for this ammunition is a boxer primer that has a single centralized ignition point (US and NATO countries). However, some other countries produce the ammunition with Berdan primers that have two flash holes.

The average chamber pressure in this round as listed in TM43-0001-27, the U.S. Army Ammunition Data Sheets — Small Caliber Ammunition, not including plastic practice, short cased spotter, or proof/test loads, is . The proof/test pressure is listed as .

==Power==

A common method for understanding the actual power of a cartridge is comparison of muzzle energies. The .30-06 Springfield, the standard caliber for American soldiers in both World Wars and a popular caliber amongst American hunters for medium to large game animals, can produce muzzle energies between . The .50 BMG round can produce between , depending on its powder and bullet type, as well as the weapon it is fired from. Due to the high ballistic coefficient of the bullet, the .50 BMG&#x27;s trajectory also suffers less &quot;drift&quot; from crosswinds than smaller and lighter calibers, making the .50 BMG a good choice for high-powered sniper rifles.

== Military cartridge types ==

It is generally fired either from pilot-aimed aircraft-mounted guns or anti-aircraft platforms, both produced by FN Herstal. It is identified by a gray over yellow tip. A tracer variant of it also exists.
; Cartridge, caliber .50, ball, Mk 323 Mod 0
: Created by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, this cartridge uses M33 ball projectiles in polymer cases instead of brass. It has a clear polymer case, with a standard brass head fused at the bottom. The Mk 323 can be fired from M2HB/M2A1 machine guns and GAU-21/A aircraft guns with the same performance. It gives a 25 percent weight saving over brass-cased ammunition allowing 40 percent more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. The Mk 323&#x27;s polymer casing is applied to tracer, AP, API, and SLAP projectiles.

DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) contracted with Teledyne Scientific Company to develop the EXACTO program, including a .50-caliber guided bullet. Videos published by DARPA show the guided bullet diverting to strike a moving target.

==Belt links==
Three distinct and non-compatible metallic links have been used for .50 BMG cartridge belts. The M2 and M9 links, &quot;pull-out&quot; designs, are used in the Browning M2 and M3 machine guns. The M15-series metal &quot;push-through&quot; links were used in the M85 machine gun. Pull-out cloth belts were also used at one time but have been obsolete since 1945.
==Legal issues==
===United Kingdom===
Within the United Kingdom, it is legal to own a bolt action .50 BMG rifle with a section 1 Firearms Certificate. Applications requesting firearms in this caliber are assessed by the same criteria as smaller calibers; with the applicant having to prove they have a valid reason for owning such a weapon.

===United States===
The specified maximum diameter of an unfired .50 BMG bullet is ; while this appears to be over the .50 inch (12.7 mm) maximum allowed for non-sporting Title I firearms under the U.S. National Firearms Act, the barrel of a .50 BMG rifle is only .50 inch (12.7 mm) across the rifling lands and slightly larger in the grooves. The oversized bullet is formed to the bore size upon firing, forming a tight seal and engaging the rifling. Subject to political controversy due to the great power of the cartridge (it is the most powerful commonly available cartridge not considered a destructive device under the National Firearms Act), it remains popular among long-range shooters for its accuracy and external ballistics. While the .50 BMG round is able to deliver accurate shot placement (if match grade ammunition is used) at ranges over , smaller-caliber rifles produce better scores and tighter groups in competitions.

A 1999 Justice Department Office of Special Investigations briefing on .50 caliber rifle crime identified several instances of the .50 BMG being involved in criminal activities. None of the cited cases has confirmed domestic violent criminal use of a .50 BMG firearm, and a majority of the domestic cases were possession charges.

In the United States, Washington, D.C. disallows registration of .50 BMG rifles, thus rendering civilian possession unlawful. California prohibits the private purchase of a rifle capable of firing the .50 BMG through the .50 Caliber BMG Regulation Act of 2004. Connecticut specifically bans the Barrett 82A1 .50 BMG rifle. However, .50 BMG rifles registered prior to the enacted bans remain lawful to possess in California and Connecticut. In Illinois, it is legal to possess a .50 caliber rifle only if it was acquired by January 10, 2023, and it was registered with the state police by January 1, 2024. Maryland imposes additional regulations on the sale and transfer of .50 BMG rifles and other weapons classed as &quot;regulated firearms&quot;, and limits purchases of any firearm within this class to one per month, but does not impose registration requirements or any form of categorical ban.

Contrary to a persistent misconception within the United States Armed Forces, using .50 BMG directly against enemy personnel is not prohibited by the laws of war. Writing for the &quot;Marine Corps Gazette&quot;, Major Hays Parks states: &quot;No treaty language exists (either generally or specifically) to support a limitation on [the use of .50 BMG] against personnel, and its widespread, longstanding use in this role suggests that such antipersonnel employment is the customary practice of nations.&quot; Parks theorizes that the misconception originated in historical doctrine discouraging the use of the M8C spotting rifle—an integral .50-caliber aiming aid for the M40 recoilless rifle—in the antipersonnel role. This limitation was entirely tactical in nature and was intended to hide the vulnerable M40 and its crew from the enemy until the main anti-tank gun was ready for firing; however, Parks concludes that some U.S. troops assumed the existence of a legal limitation on the use of .50-caliber projectiles more generally.

<text>The VIA C3 is a family of x86 central processing units for personal computers designed by Centaur Technology and sold by VIA Technologies. The different CPU cores are built following the design methodology of Centaur Technology.

In addition to x86 instructions, VIA C3 CPUs contain an undocumented Alternate Instruction Set allowing lower-level access to the CPU and in some cases privilege escalation.

==Cores==

===Samuel 2 and Ezra cores===
VIA Cyrix III was renamed VIA C3 with the switch to the advanced &quot;Samuel 2&quot; (C5B) core. The addition of an on-die L2 cache improved performance somewhat. As it was not built upon Cyrix technology at all, the new name was just a logical step. To improve power consumption and reduce manufacturing costs, Samuel 2 was produced with 150 nm process technology.

The VIA C3 processor continued an emphasis on minimizing power consumption with the next die shrink to a mixed 130/150 nm process. &quot;Ezra&quot; (C5C) and &quot;Ezra-T&quot; (C5N) were only new revisions of the &quot;Samuel 2&quot; core with some minor modifications to the bus protocol of &quot;Ezra-T&quot; to match compatibility with Intel&#x27;s Pentium III &quot;Tualatin&quot; cores. VIA enjoyed the lowest power usage in the x86 CPU market for several years. Performance, however, fell behind due to the lack of improvements to the design.

Uniquely, the retail C3 CPU shipped inside a decorative tin.

=== Nehemiah cores ===
The &quot;Nehemiah&quot; (C5XL) was a major core revision. At the time, VIA&#x27;s marketing efforts did not fully reflect the changes that had taken place. The company addressed numerous design shortcomings of the older cores, including the half-speed FPU. The number of pipeline stages was increased from 12 to 16, to allow for continued increases in clock speed. Additionally, it implemented the cmov instruction, making it a 686-class processor. The Linux kernel refers to this core as the C3-2. It also removes 3DNow! instructions in favour of implementing SSE. However, it was still based upon the aging Socket 370, running the single data rate front-side bus at just 133 MHz.

Because the embedded system marketplace prefers low-power, low-cost CPU designs, VIA began targeting this segment more aggressively because the C3 fit those traits rather well. Centaur Technology concentrated on adding features attractive to the embedded marketplace. An example built into the first &quot;Nehemiah&quot; (C5XL) core were the twin hardware random number generators. (These generators are falsely stated to be “quantum-based” in VIA&#x27;s marketing literature. Detailed analysis of the generator makes it clear that the source of randomness is thermal, not quantum.)

The &quot;Nehemiah+&quot; (C5P) (stepping 8) revision brought a few more advancements, including a high-performance AES encryption engine along with a notably small ball grid array chip package the size of a US 1 cent coin. At the time VIA also boosted the FSB to 200 MHz and introduced new chipsets such as the CN400 to support it. The new 200 MHz FSB chips are only available in BGA packages, as they are not compatible with existing Socket 370 motherboards.

When this architecture was marketed it was often referred to as the &quot;VIA C5&quot;.

== Design methodology ==

While slower than x86 CPUs being sold by AMD and Intel, both in absolute terms and on a clock-for-clock basis, VIA&#x27;s chips were much smaller, cheaper to manufacture, and lower power. This made them highly attractive in the embedded marketplace.

This also enabled VIA to continue to scale the frequencies of their chips with each manufacturing process die shrink, while competitive products from Intel (such as the P4 Prescott) encountered severe thermal management issues, although the later Intel Core generation of chips were substantially cooler.

=== C3 ===

* Because memory performance is the limiting factor in many benchmarks, VIA processors implement large primary caches, large TLBs, and aggressive prefetching, among other enhancements. While these features are not unique to VIA, memory access optimization is one area where they have not dropped features to save die space.
* Clock frequency is in general terms favored over increasing instructions per cycle. Complex features such as out-of-order instruction execution are deliberately not implemented, because they impact the ability to increase the clock rate, require a lot of extra die space and power, and have little impact on performance in several common application scenarios.
* The pipeline is arranged to provide one-clock execution of the heavily used register–memory and memory–register forms of x86 instructions. Several frequently used instructions require fewer pipeline clocks than on other x86 processors.
* Infrequently used x86 instructions are implemented in microcode and emulated. This saves die space and reduces power consumption. The impact upon the majority of real-world application scenarios is minimized.
* These design guidelines are derivative from the original RISC advocates, who stated a smaller set of instructions, better optimized, would deliver faster overall CPU performance. As it makes heavy use of memory operands, both as source and destination, the C3 design itself cannot qualify as RISC however.

== Business ==

=== Contracts ===
VIA&#x27;s embedded platform products have reportedly (2005) been adopted in Nissan&#x27;s car series, the Lafesta, Murano, and Presage. These and other high volume industrial applications are starting to generate big profits for VIA as the small form factor and low power advantages close embedded deals.

=== Legal issues ===
On the basis of the IDT Centaur acquisition, VIA appears to have come into possession of at least three patents, which cover key aspects of processor technology used by Intel. On the basis of the negotiating leverage these patents offered, in 2003 VIA arrived at an agreement with Intel that allowed for a ten-year patent cross license, enabling VIA to continue to design and manufacture x86 compatible CPUs. VIA was also granted a three-year period of grace in which it could continue to use Intel socket infrastructure.

<text>The Cryptobranchidae (commonly known as giant salamanders) are a family of large salamanders that are fully aquatic. The family includes some of the largest living amphibians. They are native to China, Japan, and the eastern United States. Giant salamanders constitute one of two living families—the other being the Asiatic salamanders belonging to the family Hynobiidae—within the Cryptobranchoidea, one of two main divisions of living salamanders.

The largest species are in the genus &quot;Andrias,&quot; native to east Asia&quot;.&quot; The South China giant salamander (&quot;Andrias sligoi&quot;), can reach a length of . The Japanese giant salamander (&quot;Andrias japonicus&quot;) reaches up to in length, feeds at night on fish and crustaceans, and has been known to live for more than 50 years in captivity.

The hellbender (&quot;Cryptobranchus alleganiensis&quot;) inhabits the eastern United States and is the only member of the genus &quot;Cryptobranchus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The family name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;krypto&quot; (&quot;hidden&quot;), and &quot;branch&quot; (&quot;gill&quot;), which refer to how the members absorb oxygen through capillaries of their side-frills, which function as gills.

=== Phylogeny ===
The following phylogeny is based on Vasilyan &quot;et al&quot;. (2013):

The well-represented Cretaceous &quot;Eoscapherpeton&quot; was not phylogenetically placed. The enigmatic &quot;Cryptobranchus&quot; &quot;saskatchewanensis&quot; of Paleocene Canada may actually represent a stem-cryptobranchid.

==Description==
Cryptobranchids are large and predominantly nocturnal salamanders that can reach a length of , though most are considerably smaller today. Despite being aquatic, they are poor swimmers and mostly just walk on the bottom. Swimming by undulatory locomotion is generally used just for short distance-escapes to hiding places. The body is stout with large folds of skin along the flanks and a heavy, laterally compressed tail. These folds help increase the animals&#x27; surface area, allowing them to absorb more oxygen from the water as the adults lacks gills and have poorly developed lungs. Like in the majority of salamander species, there are four toes on the fore limbs and five on the hind limbs. They have paedomorphic traits, meaning their metamorphosis from the larval stage is incomplete, so they lack eyelids and the adults retain gill slits (open in the hellbender, closed in Andrias). Eyes are small and the eyesight bad.

==Distribution and habitat==
In Japan, their natural habitats are threatened by dam-building. Ramps and staircases have been added to some dams to allow them to move upstream to areas where they spawn.
==Behavior==
A Japanese giant salamander lived for 52 years in captivity.

===Feeding===
The Chinese giant salamander eats aquatic insects, fish, frogs, crabs, and shrimp. They hunt mainly at night. As they have poor eyesight, they use sensory nodes on their heads and bodies to detect minute changes in water pressure, enabling them to find their prey.

===Reproduction===
During mating season, the salamanders travel upstream, where the female lays two strings of over 200 eggs each. Lacking the stereotypical courtship behaviors found in other species, the male fertilizes the eggs externally by releasing his sperm onto them, and then guards them for at least three months, until they hatch. Tail fanning also occurs in order to increase the oxygen supply for the eggs. At this point, the larvae live off their noticeable stored fat until ready to hunt. Once ready, they hunt as a group rather than individually.

Scientists at Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park in Japan have recently discovered the male salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den. Only large males can occupy and guard a den. They guard the den against other males and sexually inactive females. Those that are sexually active are welcomed. On occasion, the male &quot;den master&quot; will also allow a second male (smaller male salamanders, named &quot;satellite males&quot;, who do not have their own den) into the den; the reason for this is unclear.

==Fossil record==
Extant species in the family Cryptobranchidae are the modern-day members of a lineage that extends back tens of millions of years. The oldest known fossils of cryptobranchoids are known from the Middle Jurassic of China. &quot;Chunerpeton&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of China has been suggested to represent the oldest known cryptobranchid. However, some studies have found it to be a more basal cryptobranchoid not more closely related to Cryptobranchidae than to Hynobiidae. The next oldest cryptobranchid is &quot;Eoscapherpeton&quot;, known from numerous Late Cretaceous deposits in Central Asia, which is suggested to represent a stem-group to modern cryptobranchids. Modern crown group representatives appear during the Paleocene.

As the fossil record for the Cryptobranchidae shows an Asian origin for the family, how these salamanders made it to the eastern US has been a point of scientific interest. Research has indicated a dispersal via land bridge, with waves of adaptive radiation seeming to have swept the Americas from north to south.

In 1726, the Swiss physician Johann Jakob Scheuchzer described a fossil as &quot;Homo diluvii testis&quot; (Latin: Evidence of a diluvian human), believing it to be the remains of a human being who drowned in the biblical flood. The Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands, bought the fossil in 1802, where it is still exhibited. In 1812, the fossil was examined by Georges Cuvier, who recognized that it was not human. After being identified as a salamander, it was renamed &quot;Salamandra scheuchzeri&quot; by Holl in 1831. The genus &quot;Andrias&quot; was coined six years later by Tschudi. In doing so, both the genus, &quot;Andrias&quot; (which means &quot;image of man&quot;), and the specific name, &quot;scheuchzeri&quot;, ended up honouring Scheuchzer and his beliefs. It and the extant &quot;A. davidianus&quot; cannot be mutually distinguished, and the latter, only described in 1871, is therefore sometimes considered a synonym of the former.

<doc id="246748" wikidata="Q15615154" url="?curid=246748" title="K-theory">
<text>In mathematics, K-theory is, roughly speaking, the study of a ring generated by vector bundles over a topological space or scheme. In algebraic topology, it is a cohomology theory known as topological K-theory. In algebra and algebraic geometry, it is referred to as algebraic K-theory. It is also a fundamental tool in the field of operator algebras. It can be seen as the study of certain kinds of invariants of large matrices.

K-theory involves the construction of families of &quot;K&quot;-functors that map from topological spaces or schemes, or to be even more general: any object of a homotopy category to associated rings; these rings reflect some aspects of the structure of the original spaces or schemes. As with functors to groups in algebraic topology, the reason for this functorial mapping is that it is easier to compute some topological properties from the mapped rings than from the original spaces or schemes. Examples of results gleaned from the K-theory approach include the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, Bott periodicity, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, and the Adams operations.

In high energy physics, K-theory and in particular twisted K-theory have appeared in Type II string theory where it has been conjectured that they classify D-branes, Ramond–Ramond field strengths and also certain spinors on generalized complex manifolds. In condensed matter physics K-theory has been used to classify topological insulators, superconductors and stable Fermi surfaces. For more details, see K-theory (physics).

==Grothendieck completion==

The Grothendieck completion of an abelian monoid into an abelian group is a necessary ingredient for defining K-theory since all definitions start by constructing an abelian monoid from a suitable category and turning it into an abelian group through this universal construction. Given an abelian monoid formula_1 let formula_2 be the relation on formula_3 defined by

:formula_4

if there exists a formula_5 such that formula_6 Then, the set formula_7 has the structure of a group formula_8 where:

:formula_9

Equivalence classes in this group should be thought of as formal differences of elements in the abelian monoid. This group formula_8 is also associated with a monoid homomorphism formula_11 given by formula_12 which has a certain universal property.

To get a better understanding of this group, consider some equivalence classes of the abelian monoid formula_13. Here we will denote the identity element of formula_14 by formula_15 so that formula_16 will be the identity element of formula_17 First, formula_18 for any formula_19 since we can set formula_20 and apply the equation from the equivalence relation to get formula_21 This implies

:formula_22

hence we have an additive inverse formula_23 for each formula_24. This should give us the hint that we should be thinking of the equivalence classes formula_25 as formal differences formula_26 Another useful observation is the invariance of equivalence classes under scaling:

:formula_27 for any formula_28

The Grothendieck completion can be viewed as a functor formula_29 and it has the property that it is left adjoint to the corresponding forgetful functor formula_30 That means that, given a morphism formula_31 of an abelian monoid formula_14 to the underlying abelian monoid of an abelian group formula_33 there exists a unique abelian group morphism formula_34

=== Example for natural numbers ===
An illustrative example to look at is the Grothendieck completion of formula_35. We can see that formula_36 For any pair formula_37 we can find a minimal representative formula_38 by using the invariance under scaling. For example, we can see from the scaling invariance that

:formula_39

In general, if formula_40 then

:formula_41 which is of the form formula_42 or formula_43

This shows that we should think of the formula_44 as positive integers and the formula_45 as negative integers.

==Definitions==

There are a number of basic definitions of K-theory: two coming from topology and two from algebraic geometry.

=== Grothendieck group for compact Hausdorff spaces ===
Given a compact Hausdorff space formula_46 consider the set of isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional vector bundles over formula_46, denoted formula_48 and let the isomorphism class of a vector bundle formula_49 be denoted formula_50. Since isomorphism classes of vector bundles behave well with respect to direct sums, we can write these operations on isomorphism classes by

:formula_51

It should be clear that formula_52 is an abelian monoid where the unit is given by the trivial vector bundle formula_53. We can then apply the Grothendieck completion to get an abelian group from this abelian monoid. This is called the K-theory of formula_46 and is denoted formula_55.

We can use the Serre–Swan theorem and some algebra to get an alternative description of vector bundles over formula_46 as projective modules over the ring formula_57 of continuous complex-valued functions. Then, these can be identified with idempotent matrices in some ring of matrices formula_58. We can define equivalence classes of idempotent matrices and form an abelian monoid formula_59. Its Grothendieck completion is also called formula_55. One of the main techniques for computing the Grothendieck group for topological spaces comes from the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which makes it very accessible. The only required computations for understanding the spectral sequences are computing the group formula_61 for the spheres formula_62.pg 51-110

=== Grothendieck group of vector bundles in algebraic geometry ===
There is an analogous construction by considering vector bundles in algebraic geometry. For a Noetherian scheme formula_46 there is a set formula_48 of all isomorphism classes of algebraic vector bundles on formula_46. Then, as before, the direct sum formula_66 of isomorphisms classes of vector bundles is well-defined, giving an abelian monoid formula_52. Then, the Grothendieck group formula_55 is defined by the application of the Grothendieck construction on this abelian monoid.

=== Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves in algebraic geometry ===
In algebraic geometry, the same construction can be applied to algebraic vector bundles over a smooth scheme. But, there is an alternative construction for any Noetherian scheme formula_46. If we look at the isomorphism classes of coherent sheaves formula_70 we can mod out by the relation formula_71 if there is a short exact sequence

:formula_72

This gives the Grothendieck-group formula_73 which is isomorphic to formula_55 if formula_46 is smooth. The group formula_73 is special because there is also a ring structure: we define it as

:formula_77

Using the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, we have that

:formula_78

is an isomorphism of rings. Hence we can use formula_73 for intersection theory.

==Early history==

The subject can be said to begin with Alexander Grothendieck (1957), who used it to formulate his Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem. It takes its name from the German &quot;Klasse&quot;, meaning &quot;class&quot;. Grothendieck needed to work with coherent sheaves on an algebraic variety &quot;X&quot;. Rather than working directly with the sheaves, he defined a group using isomorphism classes of sheaves as generators of the group, subject to a relation that identifies any extension of two sheaves with their sum. The resulting group is called &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) when only locally free sheaves are used, or &quot;G&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) when all are coherent sheaves. Either of these two constructions is referred to as the Grothendieck group; &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) has cohomological behavior and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) has homological behavior.

If &quot;X&quot; is a smooth variety, the two groups are the same. If it is a smooth affine variety, then all extensions of locally free sheaves split, so the group has an alternative definition.

In topology, by applying the same construction to vector bundles, Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch defined &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) for a topological space &quot;X&quot; in 1959, and using the Bott periodicity theorem they made it the basis of an extraordinary cohomology theory. It played a major role in the second proof of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem (circa 1962). Furthermore, this approach led to a noncommutative K-theory for C*-algebras.

Already in 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with projective modules to formulate Serre&#x27;s conjecture, which states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free; this assertion is correct, but was not settled until 20 years later. (Swan&#x27;s theorem is another aspect of this analogy.)

==Developments==
The other historical origin of algebraic K-theory was the work of J. H. C. Whitehead and others on what later became known as Whitehead torsion.

There followed a period in which there were various partial definitions of &quot;higher K-theory functors&quot;. Finally, two useful and equivalent definitions were given by Daniel Quillen using homotopy theory in 1969 and 1972. A variant was also given by Friedhelm Waldhausen in order to study the &quot;algebraic K-theory of spaces,&quot; which is related to the study of pseudo-isotopies. Much modern research on higher K-theory is related to algebraic geometry and the study of motivic cohomology.

The corresponding constructions involving an auxiliary quadratic form received the general name L-theory. It is a major tool of surgery theory.

In string theory, the K-theory classification of Ramond–Ramond field strengths and the charges of stable D-branes was first proposed in 1997.

== Examples and properties ==

=== K0 of a field ===
The easiest example of the Grothendieck group is the Grothendieck group of a point formula_80 for a field formula_81. Since a vector bundle over this space is just a finite dimensional vector space, which is a free object in the category of coherent sheaves, hence projective, the monoid of isomorphism classes is formula_35 corresponding to the dimension of the vector space. It is an easy exercise to show that the Grothendieck group is then formula_83.

=== K0 of an Artinian algebra over a field ===
One important property of the Grothendieck group of a Noetherian scheme formula_46 is that it is invariant under reduction, hence formula_85. Hence the Grothendieck group of any Artinian formula_81-algebra is a direct sum of copies of formula_83, one for each connected component of its spectrum. For example,
formula_88

=== K0 of projective space ===
One of the most commonly used computations of the Grothendieck group is with the computation of formula_89 for projective space over a field. This is because the intersection numbers of a projective formula_46 can be computed by embedding formula_91 and using the push pull formula formula_92. This makes it possible to do concrete calculations with elements in formula_93 without having to explicitly know its structure since
formula_94
One technique for determining the Grothendieck group of formula_95 comes from its stratification as
formula_96
since the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on affine spaces are isomorphic to formula_97, and the intersection of formula_98 is generically
formula_99
for formula_100.

=== K0 of a projective bundle ===
Another important formula for the Grothendieck group is the projective bundle formula: given a rank r vector bundle formula_101 over a Noetherian scheme formula_46, the Grothendieck group of the projective bundle formula_103 is a free formula_93-module of rank &quot;r&quot; with basis formula_105. This formula allows one to compute the Grothendieck group of formula_106. This make it possible to compute the formula_107 or Hirzebruch surfaces. In addition, this can be used to compute the Grothendieck group formula_89 by observing it is a projective bundle over the field formula_81.

=== K0 of singular spaces and spaces with isolated quotient singularities ===
One recent technique for computing the Grothendieck group of spaces with minor singularities comes from evaluating the difference between formula_55 and formula_73, which comes from the fact every vector bundle can be equivalently described as a coherent sheaf. This is done using the Grothendieck group of the Singularity category formula_112 from derived noncommutative algebraic geometry. It gives a long exact sequence starting with
formula_113
where the higher terms come from higher K-theory. Note that vector bundles on a singular formula_46 are given by vector bundles formula_115 on the smooth locus formula_116. This makes it possible to compute the Grothendieck group on weighted projective spaces since they typically have isolated quotient singularities. In particular, if these singularities have isotropy groups formula_117 then the map
formula_118
is injective and the cokernel is annihilated by formula_119 for formula_120.pg 3

=== K0 of a smooth projective curve ===
For a smooth projective curve formula_121 the Grothendieck group is
formula_122
for Picard group of formula_121. This follows from the Brown-Gersten-Quillen spectral sequencepg 72 of algebraic K-theory. For a regular scheme of finite type over a field, there is a convergent spectral sequence
formula_124
for formula_125 the set of codimension formula_126 points, meaning the set of subschemes formula_127 of codimension formula_126, and formula_129 the algebraic function field of the subscheme. This spectral sequence has the propertypg 80
formula_130
for the Chow ring of formula_46, essentially giving the computation of formula_132. Note that because formula_121 has no codimension formula_134 points, the only nontrivial parts of the spectral sequence are formula_135, hence
formula_136
The coniveau filtration can then be used to determine formula_132 as the desired explicit direct sum since it gives an exact sequence
formula_138
where the left hand term is isomorphic to formula_139 and the right hand term is isomorphic to formula_140. Since formula_141, we have the sequence of abelian groups above splits, giving the isomorphism. Note that if formula_121 is a smooth projective curve of genus formula_143 over formula_144, then
formula_145
Moreover, the techniques above using the derived category of singularities for isolated singularities can be extended to isolated Cohen-Macaulay singularities, giving techniques for computing the Grothendieck group of any singular algebraic curve. This is because reduction gives a generically smooth curve, and all singularities are Cohen-Macaulay.

==Applications==
===Virtual bundles===
One useful application of the Grothendieck-group is to define virtual vector bundles. For example, if we have an embedding of smooth spaces formula_146 then there is a short exact sequence

:formula_147

where formula_148 is the conormal bundle of formula_149 in formula_46. If we have a singular space formula_149 embedded into a smooth space formula_46 we define the virtual conormal bundle as

:formula_153

Another useful application of virtual bundles is with the definition of a virtual tangent bundle of an intersection of spaces: Let formula_154 be projective subvarieties of a smooth projective variety. Then, we can define the virtual tangent bundle of their intersection formula_155 as

:formula_156

Kontsevich uses this construction in one of his papers.

===Chern characters===

Chern classes can be used to construct a homomorphism of rings from the topological K-theory of a space to (the completion of) its rational cohomology. For a line bundle &quot;L&quot;, the Chern character ch is defined by

:formula_157

More generally, if formula_158 is a direct sum of line bundles, with first Chern classes formula_159 the Chern character is defined additively

:formula_160

The Chern character is useful in part because it facilitates the computation of the Chern class of a tensor product. The Chern character is used in the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem.

==Equivariant K-theory==
The equivariant algebraic K-theory is an algebraic K-theory associated to the category formula_161 of equivariant coherent sheaves on an algebraic scheme formula_46 with action of a linear algebraic group formula_163, via Quillen&#x27;s Q-construction; thus, by definition,

:formula_164

In particular, formula_165 is the Grothendieck group of formula_161. The theory was developed by R. W. Thomason in 1980s. Specifically, he proved equivariant analogs of fundamental theorems such as the localization theorem.

<text>Henry Ossian Flipper (March 21, 1856 – April 26, 1940) was an American soldier, engineer, former slave and in 1877, the first African American to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point, earning a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was also an author who wrote about scientific topics and his life experiences.

After his commissioning, he was assigned to one of the all-black regiments in the U.S. Army, which were historically led by white officers. Assigned to &#x27;A&#x27; Troop under the command of Captain Nicholas M. Nolan, he became the first nonwhite officer to lead buffalo soldiers of the 10th Cavalry. Flipper served with competency and distinction during the Apache Wars and the Victorio Campaign, but was haunted by rumors alleging improprieties. Eventually, he was court-martialed and dismissed from the U.S. Army.

After losing his commission in the Army, Flipper worked throughout Mexico and Latin America as an assistant to the Secretary of the Interior. He retired to Atlanta in 1931 and died of natural causes in 1940.

In 1976, his descendants applied to the U.S. military for a review of Flipper&#x27;s court-martial and dismissal. A review found the conviction and punishment were &quot;unduly harsh and unjust&quot; and ordered Flipper&#x27;s dismissal be changed to a good conduct discharge. Shortly afterwards, an application for pardon was filed with the Secretary of the Army, which was forwarded to the Department of Justice. Eventually, President Bill Clinton posthumously pardoned Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper on February 19, 1999, 118 years after his conviction.

==Early life and education==
Flipper was born into slavery in Thomasville, Georgia, the eldest of five brothers including Joseph Simeon. His mother, Isabelle Flipper, and his father, Festus Flipper, a shoemaker and carriage-trimmer, were enslaved by Ephraim G. Ponder, a wealthy slave trader.

Flipper attended Atlanta University during Reconstruction. There, as a freshman, he was appointed by Representative James C. Freeman to attend West Point, where four other black cadets were already attending. The small group had a difficult time at the academy, where they were rejected by white students. Nevertheless, Flipper persevered, and in 1877, became the first of the group to graduate, earning a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army cavalry. He was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, one of the four all-black &quot;buffalo soldier&quot; regiments in the Army, and became the first black officer to command regular troops in the U.S. Army (all-black regiments had been commanded by white officers).

==10th Cavalry Regiment==

In July 1877, Flipper reported to Fort Sill in the Indian Territory, for assignment with the 10th Cavalry. But the 10th was not at Fort Sill, they were at Fort Concho. He was not assigned to a cavalry troop, but given work assignments including engineering a ditch to drain a swamp that was malaria-infested. He supervised the construction of roads and telegraph lines. Finally, Flipper received orders to report to Fort Concho in West Texas in October 1877 and was assigned to &#x27;A&#x27; Troop. He was the first nonwhite officer to lead buffalo soldiers of the 10th Cavalry.

Captain Nicholas M. Nolan, the commander of &#x27;A&#x27; troop, was the officer assigned to teach him about being a cavalry officer. Nolan was censured by several white officers for allowing Flipper into his quarters for dinner, where his daughter Kate was present. Nolan defended his action by stating that Flipper was an &quot;officer and a gentleman&quot; just like any other officer present.

In August 1878, Captain Nolan married his second wife, Anne Eleanor Dwyer, in San Antonio, Texas. They had one child, a girl. Anne&#x27;s sister, Miss Mollie Dwyer, arrived shortly after Troop A moved to Fort Elliott in Texas in early 1879. Mollie Dwyer and Flipper became friends and often went riding together. Nolan was the &quot;de facto&quot; commander of Fort Elliott and he made Flipper his adjutant. Flipper received high marks from his commander. However, rumors and letters hinted at improprieties against Flipper, an African American and Dwyer, a Caucasian. It was the beginning of a smear campaign. During the next many months, he sent and received letters from Mollie.

In the fall of 1879, a Federal Marshal named Norton, armed with blank warrants, began a quarrel with a county judge. Other county officials stepped in to defend the judge and Norton arrested all of them with his armed men. Norton took the county men to Fort Elliott to be placed in the guardhouse. Nolan was required by law to accept the prisoners, and Nolan apparently talked with the Wheeler County Judge. The telegraph lines then were suddenly cut and Nolan decided to act. Flipper gathered the prisoners in the middle of the night, and with two soldiers, set off for another fort in Indian Territory.

Norton captured the entire party and arrested Flipper and one of his soldiers. The other soldier ran back to the fort to report what had happened. Norton then set off for Dallas, Texas. Nolan mounted a detail of men and took off in pursuit. He caught up to the party and made it clearly known that no prisoners would be shot while trying to escape because the federal marshal and his prisoners were now under military escort. A federal judge dismissed the warrants and Norton filed federal charges of &quot;interfering with the process of the law&quot; against the two officers. The two officers were quickly tried and found guilty. Both were fined $1,000, which was an enormous fine for its time (). Norton was satisfied, then left. The federal judge then suspended payment and dismissed the two military officers. Army relations in Wheeler County improved tremendously. Nolan had Flipper under his wing for the first part of the Apache Wars in early 1879 until he was reassigned to G Troop. Until November 1879, during his captain&#x27;s four-month leave, Flipper commanded this unit by himself and received a well done.

In May 1880, Flipper and Nolan reunited during the Victorio Campaign. It was the last time the two met. Throughout this period, his military career was encumbered by racism in the military, though he did have the support of some officers, such as Nolan, and many of the white civilians he encountered who were impressed by his competency. In the later part of 1880, Flipper was transferred to Fort Davis in West Texas and assigned as the post quartermaster and commissary officer.

==End of military career==
Colonel William Rufus Shafter assumed command at Fort Davis in March 1881. He had been the commander of the First Infantry Regiment at Fort Davis. Shafter had a reputation as harassing officers he disliked. Flipper was dismissed without cause as quartermaster within days. Then Shafter &quot;asked&quot; Flipper to keep the quartermaster&#x27;s safe in his quarters. Being &quot;asked&quot; by a superior officer was a &quot;de facto&quot; order and Flipper complied. In July 1881, Flipper found a shortage of over $2,000.00 (). Realizing this could be used against him by officers intent on forcing him out of the army, he attempted to hide the discrepancy, which was later discovered, and then lied about it when confronted. In August, he was arrested by Shafter for embezzling government funds. Word quickly spread about the missing money. Many felt it was a setup and soldiers and the community came up with the money to replace what was missing within four days. Shafter accepted the money, then convened a court-martial on September 17, 1881.

In December 1881, the court-martial found Flipper innocent of the main charge, but another charge was added during the trial, and he was found guilty &quot;of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman&quot;, and sentenced to be &quot;dismissed from the service of the United States&quot;. It was more than a harsh sentence. In two prior situations involving white officers who had been found guilty of embezzlement, neither officer was dismissed nor dishonored. The letters exchanged between Mollie Dwyer (Nolan&#x27;s sister-in-law) and Flipper were used against Flipper. Relationships between whites and blacks were strictly forbidden in the viewpoint of the white officers on the board. Despite appeals, and with the denial of a lighter sentence from President Chester A. Arthur, Flipper was drummed out of the army with a dismissal, the officer equivalent of a dishonorable discharge, on June 30, 1882. For the rest of his life, Flipper contested the charges and fought to regain his commission.

==After the military==

After his dismissal, Flipper remained in Texas, working as a civil engineer in El Paso. In 1898, he volunteered to serve in the Spanish–American War, but requests to restore his commission were ignored by Congress. Flipper spent time in Mexico where, according to folklorist J. Frank Dobie, he attempted to discover the location of the legendary lost silver mine of Tayopa. Upon returning to the United States, he served as an adviser to Senator Albert Fall on Mexican politics. When Senator Fall became Secretary of the Interior in 1921, he brought Flipper with him to Washington, D.C., to serve as his assistant.

In 1923, Flipper went to work in Venezuela as an engineer in the petroleum industry. He retired to Atlanta in 1931, and died in 1940. He was buried in the family plot at South-View Cemetery, but in February 1978 he was exhumed and reburied in his home town of Thomasville.

==Legacy==

In 1976, descendants and supporters applied to the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records on behalf of Flipper. The board, after stating it did not have the authority to overturn his court-martial conviction, concluded the conviction and punishment were &quot;unduly harsh and unjust&quot; and recommended that Flipper&#x27;s dismissal be changed to a good conduct discharge. The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) and the Adjutant General approved the board&#x27;s findings, conclusions, and recommendations, and directed the Department of the Army to issue Flipper a Certificate of Honorable Discharge, dated June 30, 1882, in lieu of his dismissal on the same date. On October 21, 1997, a private law firm, Arnold &amp; Porter, filed an application of pardon with the Secretary of the Army on Flipper&#x27;s behalf. Seven months later, the application was forwarded by the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) to the Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice with a recommendation that the pardon be approved. Many pardon applications had been rejected in the past – as a matter of policy – because the intended recipients were deceased. However, President Bill Clinton pardoned Flipper on February 19, 1999.
After his discharge was changed, a bust of Flipper was unveiled at West Point. Since then, an annual Henry O. Flipper Award has been granted to graduating cadets at the academy who exhibit &quot;leadership, self-discipline, and perseverance in the face of unusual difficulties.&quot;

Throughout his life, Flipper was a prolific author, writing about scientific topics, the history of the Southwest, and his own experiences. In &quot;The Colored Cadet at West Point&quot; (1878) he describes his experiences at the military academy. In the posthumous &quot;Negro Frontiersman: The Western Memoirs of Henry O. Flipper&quot; (1963), he describes his life in Texas and Arizona after his discharge from the Army.

<doc id="246752" wikidata="Q982880" url="?curid=246752" title="William Inge">
<text>William Motter Inge (; May 3, 1913 – June 10, 1973) was an American playwright and novelist, whose works typically feature solitary protagonists encumbered with strained sexual relations. In the early 1950s he had a string of memorable Broadway productions, including &quot;Picnic&quot;, which earned him a Pulitzer Prize. With his portraits of small-town life and settings rooted in the American heartland, Inge became known as the &quot;Playwright of the Midwest&quot;.

==Early years==
Inge was born in Independence, Kansas, the fifth child of Maude Sarah Gibson-Inge and Luther Clay Inge. William attended Independence Community College and graduated from the University of Kansas in 1935 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Speech and Drama. At the University of Kansas he was a member of the Nu chapter of Sigma Nu. Offered a scholarship to work on a Master of Arts degree, Inge moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to attend the George Peabody College for Teachers, but later dropped out.

Back in Kansas, he worked as a laborer on state highways and as a Wichita news announcer. From 1937 to 1938 he taught English and drama at Cherokee County Community High School in Columbus, Kansas. After returning and completing his Master&#x27;s at Peabody in 1938, he taught at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, from 1938 to 1943.

==Career==
Inge began as a drama critic at the &quot;St. Louis Star-Times&quot; in 1943. With Tennessee Williams&#x27;s encouragement, Inge wrote his first play, &quot;Farther Off from Heaven&quot; (1947), which was staged at Margo Jones&#x27; Theatre &#x27;47 in Dallas, Texas. As a teacher at Washington University in St. Louis between 1946 and 1949, he wrote &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;. It ran on Broadway for 190 performances in 1950, winning Tony Awards for Shirley Booth and Sidney Blackmer. (The 1952 film adaptation won both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Shirley Booth. Willy van Hemert directed a 1955 adaptation for Dutch television, and NBC aired another TV production in 1977.) During his time teaching at Washington University, Inge&#x27;s struggles with alcoholism became more acute; in 1947, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). It was through AA that Inge met the wife of a member of his AA group whose name was Lola and, who through name as well as personal characteristics, was the person upon whom one of the lead characters in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, &quot;Lola&quot;, was based. Even as &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; was in a pre-Broadway run in early 1950, Inge was filled with some doubt as to its success. He expressed in a letter to his sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous, &quot;If &quot;Sheba&quot; makes it in Hartford I guess it will go on to Broadway and if it doesn&#x27;t I suppose I&#x27;ll be back in St. Louis. If it does make it to Broadway, I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll be back.&quot; Inge never had to return to St. Louis.
In 1953, Inge received a Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Picnic&quot;, a play based on women he had known as a small child:
:When I was a boy in Kansas, my mother had a boarding house. There were three women school teachers living in the house. I was four years old, and they were nice to me. I liked them. I saw their attempts, and, even as a child, I sensed every woman&#x27;s failure. I began to sense the sorrow and the emptiness in their lives, and it touched me.

&quot;Picnic&quot; had a successful Broadway run from February 19, 1953, to April 10, 1954. A film adaptation made in 1955 was directed by Joshua Logan and won two Academy Awards.

In 1953, Inge&#x27;s short play &quot;Glory in the Flower&quot; was telecast on &quot;Omnibus&quot; with a cast of Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, and James Dean.

In 1955, his play &quot;Bus Stop&quot; premiered. Inge&#x27;s inspiration of boy-pursuing-girl came from a similar situation he&#x27;d seen on a bus trip to Kansas City. Nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Play, it was made into a 1956 film starring Marilyn Monroe.

In 1957 he wrote &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot;, an expansion of his earlier &quot;Farther Off from Heaven&quot;. The play was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Play, and was adapted as a film in 1960.

His 1959 play &quot;A Loss of Roses&quot;, with Carol Haney, Warren Beatty, and Betty Field, was filmed as &quot;The Stripper&quot; (1963), with Joanne Woodward, Richard Beymer, and Claire Trevor, and a popular Jerry Goldsmith score.

&quot;Natural Affection&quot; had the misfortune to open on Broadway during the 1962 New York City newspaper strike, which lasted from December 8, 1962, until April 1, 1963. Thus, few were aware of the play, and fewer bought tickets. It lasted only 36 performances, from January 31, 1963, to March 2, 1963. What theatergoers missed was a drama exploring themes of fragmented families and random violence. As with Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, the inspiration for &quot;Natural Affection&quot; came from a newspaper account of a seemingly meaningless and unmotivated murder. The play centers on a single mother, Chicago department store buyer Sue Barker (Kim Stanley). While troubled teen Donnie (Gregory Rozakis), Sue&#x27;s illegitimate son, has been away at reform school, she has entered into a relationship with Cadillac salesman Bernie Slovenk (Harry Guardino). With Donnie&#x27;s unexpected return to her Chicago apartment, conflicts escalate, and Donnie finds himself on an emotional precipice. The closing five minutes of the play introduces a new character, a young woman Donnie meets in the apartment hallway. He invites her into the apartment and, without warning, kills her as the curtains close. The Broadway production, directed by Tony Richardson, benefited from composer John Lewis&#x27;s made-to-order background music, which was provided via tape recordings, rather than live performance, and worked in the same fashion as a film score. A highly successful revival of &quot;Natural Affection&quot; was mounted in 2005 at Chicago&#x27;s The Artistic Home. Directed by John Mossman, it was named by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; one of the year&#x27;s best productions.

Inge&#x27;s &quot;The Last Pad&quot; premiered in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1972. Originally titled &quot;The Disposal&quot;, the world premiere of &quot;The Last Pad&quot; was produced by Robert L. &quot;Bob&quot; Johnson and directed by Keith A. Anderson through the Southwest Ensemble Theatre. The production starred Nick Nolte with Jim Matz and Richard Elmore (Elmer). The production moved to Los Angeles and opened just days after Inge died by suicide. The original production in Phoenix was proclaimed the Best Play of 1972 by the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, while the Los Angeles production brought awards to Nolte and helped introduce him to the film industry and catapult his subsequent film career.

&quot;The Last Pad&quot; is one of three of Inge&#x27;s plays that either have openly gay characters or address homosexuality directly. &quot;The Boy in the Basement&quot;, a one-act play written in the early 1950s, but not published until 1962, is his only play that addresses homosexuality overtly, while Archie in &quot;The Last Pad&quot; and Pinky in &quot;Where&#x27;s Daddy?&quot; (1966) are gay characters. Inge himself was closeted.

&quot;Summer Brave&quot;, produced posthumously on Broadway in 1975, is Inge&#x27;s reworking of &quot;Picnic&quot;, as he noted:
:It would be fair to say that &quot;Summer Brave&quot; is the original version of &quot;Picnic&quot;. I have written before that I never completely fulfilled my original intentions in writing &quot;Picnic&quot; before we went into production in 1953, and that I wrote what some considered a fortuitous ending in order to have a finished play to go into rehearsal. A couple of years after &quot;Picnic&quot; had closed on Broadway, after the film version had made its success, I got the early version out of my files and began to rework it, just for my own satisfaction. &quot;Summer Brave&quot; is the result. I admit that I prefer it to the version of the play that was produced, but I don&#x27;t necessarily expect others to agree. &quot;Summer Brave&quot; might not have enjoyed any success on Broadway whatever, nor won any of the prizes that were bestowed upon &quot;Picnic&quot;. But I feel that it is more humorously true than &quot;Picnic&quot;, and it does fulfill my original intentions.

About two dozen unperformed plays by Inge began receiving wider attention in 2009. They were available for viewing, but not copying or borrowing, in the collection of his papers at Independence Community College. One, a three-act play titled &quot;Off the Main Road&quot;, was read at the Flea Theater in New York City on May 11, 2009, with Sigourney Weaver, Jay O. Sanders, and Frances Sternhagen in the cast. Another, &quot;The Killing&quot;, a one-act play, directed by José Angel Santana, and starring Neal Huff and J.J. Kandel, was performed at the 59E59 Theater, in New York City, through August 27, 2009. It is not yet known how many of these additional plays are complete. Besides &quot;Off the Main Road&quot; and &quot;The Killing&quot;, six others were performed in April 2009 at the William Inge Theater Festival, in Independence, Kansas. These six were published in &quot;A Complex Evening: Six Short Plays by William Inge&quot;.

===Television and film===
In 1961, Inge won an Academy Award for &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (Best Writing, Story and Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen). He made his film debut as a clergyman in the film. John Frankenheimer directed &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962), Inge&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of the novel by James Leo Herlihy. Inge was unhappy with changes made to his screenplay for &quot;Bus Riley&#x27;s Back in Town&quot; (1965), so at his insistence, the writing credit on the film is &quot;Walter Gage&quot;.

During the 1961–62 television season, Inge was the script supervisor of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Bus Stop&quot; TV series, an adaptation of his play. With Marilyn Maxwell as Grace Sherwood, the owner of Sherwood&#x27;s Bus Station and Diner in a fictitious Colorado town, the series presented dramas about the townspeople and travelers who passed through the diner in 25 one-hour episodes. The sixth episode, &quot;Cherie&quot;, with Tuesday Weld, Gary Lockwood and Joseph Cotten, was an abbreviated version of the original &quot;Bus Stop&quot; play. Robert Altman directed eight episodes, and one of these, &quot;A Lion Walks Among Us&quot;, led to a Congressional hearing on violence. The episode, which starred Fabian Forte as a maniacal axe-wielding serial killer, was adapted from Tom Wicker&#x27;s novel &quot;Told By an Idiot&quot;.

In 1963 Inge met with CBS to consider a one-hour filmed television drama about a family in a Midwestern town. The series, with six continuing characters, had the tentative title &quot;All Over Town&quot;, and was planned for the 1964–65 season. Instead, Inge did a play, &quot;Out on the Outskirts of Town&quot;, which was seen on November 6, 1964, on NBC as part of the &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; series. It starred Anne Bancroft and Jack Warden with Inge taking the role of the town doctor. NBC gave the play a repeat on June 25, 1965.

===Novels===

Inge wrote two novels, both set in the fictional town of Freedom, Kansas. In &quot;Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff&quot; (Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1970), high-school Latin teacher Evelyn Wyckoff loses her job because she has an affair with the school&#x27;s black janitor. The novel&#x27;s themes include spinsterhood, racism, sexual tension and public humiliation during the late 1950s. Polly Platt wrote the screenplay for the 1979 film adaptation starring Anne Heywood as Evelyn Wyckoff. The film was released under several titles: &quot;The Shaming&quot;, &quot;The Sin&quot;, &quot;Secret Yearnings&quot; and &quot;Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff&quot;.

&quot;My Son Is a Splendid Driver&quot; (Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1971) is an autobiographical novel that traces the Hansen family from 1919 into the second half of the 20th century. The novel received praise from &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;:
:Mr. Inge&#x27;s novel, told in the form of a memoir, is a little more extended than &quot;Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff&quot; and though there&#x27;s a slackening of structure and splintering of content towards the second half, the first part is immaculate in both design and focus. It features the early years of Joey, the narrator here, and there are lovely scenes, as clear as the summer sunlight, with his family and on visits to assorted relatives. The time lag between Joey and his older brother Jule—his mother&#x27;s favorite, my son the splendid driver, and an attractive playboy of this midwestern world—will never be reconciled. Even long after Jule&#x27;s early death from a wanton incidental. Here Act I breaks away from Act II, a whole psychic anatomy of Joey&#x27;s years as a young man in compressed and fractured incidents—one replayed from Miss Wyckoff and one which seems unnecessary (his parents&#x27; syphilis). Thus Joey grows up impaired, never resolving his relationship with his absentee father or insufficiently loving mother, and ends up with his &quot;aloneness like a corridor that has no end&quot;. Inge has told his story of life and death and all those spaces in between with a gentleness and probity which gives his novel a persistence few writers achieve.

During the early 1970s Inge lived in Los Angeles, where he taught playwriting at the University of California, Irvine. His last several plays attracted little notice or critical acclaim, and he fell into a deep depression, convinced he would never be able to write well again.

==Death and legacy==
Inge died of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on June 10, 1973, at the Hollywood home he shared with his sister, Helene. He was 60 years old. Inge is buried at Mt. Hope Cemetery in his hometown of Independence, Kansas.

Inge has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

Beginning with the premiere of &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; in 1950, Inge became wealthy from the success of his plays and movies. On the advice of his financial advisors, he began to buy works of contemporary art so he could reduce his taxes by donating them to museums. According to his biographer, “He bought only what he liked, but had excellent fortune in choosing what was going to become valuable...” [e.g. works by de Kooning, Pollock, and Modigliani]. Inge liked the modern art he bought because “in its abstractions and distortions” he saw “a reflection of the distorted times in which he...lived, the times he...tried to portray” in his written work. He donated a total of ten contemporary paintings to the Nelson Gallery in Kansas City, Missouri.

A black box theater is named for William Inge in Murphy Hall at the University of Kansas.

Inge is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, inducted posthumously in 1979.

Since 1982, Independence Community College&#x27;s William Inge Center for the Arts in his hometown has sponsored the annual William Inge Theatre Festival to honor playwrights. The William Inge Collection at the college is the most extensive collection of Inge material, including 400 manuscripts, films, correspondence, theater programs, and other related items.

The March 2008 issue of &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot; featured interviews by playwright Adam Kraar of former Inge House resident playwrights Marcia Cebulska, Catherine Filloux, Caridad Svich, Lydia Stryk, and Alice Tuan, relating how Inge&#x27;s life and work has influenced them.

<text>The Linux Standard Base (LSB) was a joint project by several Linux distributions under the organizational structure of the Linux Foundation to standardize the software system structure, including the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. LSB was based on the POSIX specification, the Single UNIX Specification (SUS), and several other open standards, but extended them in certain areas.

According to LSB:

The goal of the LSB is to develop and promote a set of open standards that will increase compatibility among Linux distributions and enable software applications to run on any compliant system even in binary form. In addition, the LSB will help coordinate efforts to recruit software vendors to port and write products for Linux Operating Systems.
LSB compliance might be certified for a product by a certification procedure.

LSB specified standard libraries (centered around the ), a number of commands and utilities that extend the POSIX standard, the layout of the file system hierarchy, run levels, the printing system, including spoolers such as CUPS and tools like Foomatic, and several extensions to the X Window System. It also specified boot facilities, such as &quot;$local_fs&quot;, &quot;$network&quot;, which were used to indicate service dependencies in System V-style initialization scripts. A machine readable comment block at the top of a script provided the information necessary to determine at which point of the initialization process the script should be invoked; it was called the LSB header.

The command codice_1 was available in many systems to get the LSB version details, or could be made available by installing an appropriate package, for example the codice_2 package in Red-Hat-flavored distributions such as Fedora, or the codice_3 package in Debian-based distributions.

The standard stopped being updated in 2015 and current Linux distributions do not adhere to or offer it; however, the codice_4 command is sometimes still available. On February 7, 2023, a former maintainer of the LSB wrote, &quot;The LSB project is essentially abandoned.&quot;

==Backward compatibility==
LSB was designed to be binary-compatible and produced a stable application binary interface (ABI) for independent software vendors. To achieve backward compatibility, each subsequent version was purely additive. In other words, interfaces were only added; no interfaces were removed. The LSB adopted an interface deprecation policy to give application developers enough time in case an interface was removed from LSB.

This allowed the developer to rely on every interface in LSB for a known time and also to plan for changes. Interfaces were only removed after having been marked &quot;deprecated&quot; for at least three major versions, or roughly eleven years.

LSB 5.0 was the first major release that broke backward compatibility with earlier versions.

==Reception==
While LSB was a standard and without a competitor, it was followed only by few Linux distributions. For instance, only 21 distribution releases (versions) were certified for LSB version 4.0, notably Red Flag Linux Desktop 6.0, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0, SUSE Linux Enterprise 11, and Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope); even fewer were certified for version 4.1.

The LSB was criticized for not taking input from projects, most notably the Debian project, outside the sphere of its member companies.

===Choice of the RPM package format===
LSB specified that software packages should either be delivered as an LSB-compliant installer, or (preferably) be delivered in a restricted form of the RPM Package Manager format.

This choice of package format precluded the use of other existing package formats not compatible with RPM. To address this, the standard did not dictate which package format the system must use for its own packages, merely that RPM must be supported to allow packages from third-party distributors to be installed on a conforming system.

===Limitations on Debian===
Debian included optional support for LSB early on, at version 1.1 in &quot;woody&quot; (3.0; July 19, 2002), 2.0 in &quot;sarge&quot; (3.1; June 6, 2005), 3.1 in &quot;etch&quot; (4.0; April 8, 2007), 3.2 in &quot;lenny&quot; (5.0; February 14, 2009) and 4.1 in &quot;wheezy&quot; (7; May 4, 2013). To use foreign LSB-compliant RPM packages, the end-user needs to use Debian&#x27;s Alien program to transform them into the native package format and then install them.

The LSB-specified RPM format had a restricted subset of RPM features—to block usage of RPM features that would be untranslatable to .deb with Alien or other package conversion programs, and vice versa, as each format has capabilities the other lacks. In practice, not all Linux binary packages were necessarily LSB-compliant, so while most could be converted between .rpm and .deb, this operation was restricted to a subset of packages.

By using Alien, Debian was LSB-compatible for all intents and purposes, but according to the description of their codice_5 package, the presence of the package &quot;does not imply that we believe that Debian fully complies with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.&quot;

Debian strived to comply with the LSB, but with many limitations. However, this effort ceased around July 2015 due to lack of interest and workforce inside the project. In September 2015, the Debian project confirmed that while support for Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) would continue, support for LSB had been dropped. Ubuntu followed Debian in November 2015.

===Quality of compliance test suites===
Additionally, the compliance test suites were criticized for being buggy and incomplete—most notably, in 2005 Ulrich Drepper criticized the LSB for poorly written tests which can cause incompatibility between LSB-certified distributions when some implement incorrect behavior to make buggy tests work, while others apply for and receive waivers from complying with the tests. He also denounced a lack of application testing, pointing out that testing only distributions can never solve the problem of applications relying on implementation-defined behavior.

For the vendors considering LSB certifications in their portability efforts, the Linux Foundation sponsored a tool that analyzed and provided guidance on symbols and libraries that go beyond the LSB.

<text>The Free Standards Group was an industry non-profit consortium chartered to primarily specify and drive the adoption of open source standards, founded on May 8, 2000.

All standards developed by the Free Standards Group (FSG) were released under open terms (the GNU Free Documentation License with no cover texts or invariant sections) and test suites, sample implementations and other software were released as free software.

On January 22, 2007, the Free Standards Group and the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) merged to form The Linux Foundation, narrowing their focus to promoting Linux in competition with Microsoft Windows.

==Work groups==
FSG was responsible for the following work groups, and transferred responsibility to The Linux Foundation:

* The Linux Standard Base (LSB), a set of interface standards to maintain ultimate portability of applications across various Linux versions and distributions. Conformance with this specification is certified by The Open Group (under contract with the Free Standards Group).
* The Open Internationalization Initiative (OpenI18N), a standard that creates a foundation for language globalization of compliant distributions and applications
* The Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority (LANANA)
* OpenPrinting, creating a scalable printing architecture and high-level requirements for a standardized printing system
* Accessibility, developing accessibility standards for free and open source platforms
* Open Cluster, defining a set of clustering interface standards
* The DWARF Debugging Format Standard

<doc id="246766" wikidata="Q1237" url="?curid=246766" title="Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol">
<text>Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol ( ) is an autonomous region of Italy, located in the northern part of the country. The region has a population of 1.1 million, of whom 62% speak Italian as their mother tongue, 30% speak South Tyrolean German and several foreign languages are spoken by immigrant communities. Since the 1970s, most legislative and administrative powers have been transferred to the two self-governing provinces that make up the region: the province of Trento, commonly known as Trentino, and the province of Bolzano, commonly known as South Tyrol (&quot;Alto Adige&quot; in Italian). In South Tyrol, German remains the sizeable majority language.

From the 9th century until 1801, the region was part of the Holy Roman Empire. After being part of the short-lived Napoleonic Republic of Italy and Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, the region was part of the Austrian Empire and its successor Austria-Hungary from 1815 until its 1919 transfer to Italy in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye at the end of World War I. Together with the Austrian state of Tyrol, it is part of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino. In English language, the region is known as Trentino-South Tyrol, or by its Italian name Trentino-Alto Adige.

== History ==

The Romans conquered the region in 15 BC. After the end of the Western Roman Empire, it was divided between the invading Germanic tribes in the Lombard Duchy of Tridentum (today&#x27;s Trentino), the Alamannic Vinschgau, and the Bavarians (who took the remaining part). After the creation of the Kingdom of Italy under Charlemagne, the Marquisate of Verona included the areas south of Bolzano, while the Duchy of Bavaria received the remaining part.

From the 11th century onwards, part of the region was governed by the prince-bishops of Trent and Brixen, to whom the Holy Roman Emperors had given extensive temporal powers over their bishoprics. Soon, they were overruled by the Counts of Tyrol and Counts of Görz, who also controlled the Puster Valley: in 1363 its last titular, Margarete, Countess of Tyrol ceded the region to the House of Habsburg. The regions north of Salorno were largely Germanized in the early Middle Ages, and important German poets like Arbeo of Freising and Oswald von Wolkenstein were born and lived in the southern part of Tyrol.

The two bishoprics were secularized by the Treaty of Lunéville of 1803 and given to the Habsburgs. Two years later, following the Austrian defeat at Austerlitz, the region was given to Napoleon&#x27;s ally Bavaria (Treaty of Pressburg, 1805). The new rulers provoked a popular rebellion in 1809, led by Andreas Hofer, a landlord from St. Leonhard in Passeier; this rebellion was crushed the same year. At the resulting Treaty of Paris (28 February 1810), Bavaria ceded the southern part of Tyrol (Trentino and the city of Bolzano) to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. During French control of the region, it was called officially &quot;Haut Adige&quot; (Italian: &quot;Alto Adige&quot;; German: &quot;Hochetsch&quot;), literally &quot;High Adige&quot;, in order to avoid any reference to the historical County of Tyrol. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815, the region returned to Austria.
Under Austrian rule the territory of today&#x27;s province of South Tyrol was called &quot;südliches Tirol&quot; or &quot;Deutschsüdtirol&quot;, but was occasionally also referred to as &quot;Mitteltirol&quot;, i.e. Middle Tyrol, due to its geographic position, while &quot;Südtirol&quot; (), i.e. South Tyrol, indicated mostly today&#x27;s province of Trentino. Trentino was also called &#x27; (&quot;Romance Tyrol&quot;, ) or &#x27; (&quot;Romance South Tyrol&quot;, ). Sometimes &quot;Südtirol&quot; also indicated the whole of the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region.

During the First World War, major battles were fought high in the Alps and Dolomites between Austro-Hungarian Kaiserjäger and Italian Alpini, for whom control of the region was a key strategic objective. The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian war effort enabled Italian troops to occupy the region in 1918 and its annexation was confirmed in the post-war treaties, which awarded the region to Italy under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain.

Under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini, the Fascist dictator of Italy (ruled 1922–1943), the German population was subjected to an increased forced programme of Italianization: all references to old Tyrol were banned and the region was referred to as &quot;Venezia Tridentina&quot; between 1919 and 1947, in an attempt to justify the Italian claims to the area by historically linking the region to one of the Roman Regions of Italy (Regio X &quot;Venetia et Histria&quot;). Hitler and Mussolini agreed in 1938 that the German-speaking population would be transferred to German-ruled territory or dispersed around Italy, but the outbreak of the Second World War prevented them from fully carrying out the relocation. Nevertheless, thousands of people were relocated to Nazi Germany and only with great difficulties managed to return to their ancestral land after the end of the war.

In 1943, when the Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies, the region was occupied by Germany, which reorganised it as the Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills and put it under the administration of Gauleiter Franz Hofer. The region was &quot;de facto&quot; annexed to the German Reich (with the addition of the province of Belluno) until the end of the war. This status ended along with the Nazi regime and Italian rule was restored in 1945.

Italy and Austria negotiated the Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement in 1946, put into effect in 1947 when the new republican Italian constitution was promulgated, that the region would be granted considerable autonomy. German and Italian were both made official languages, and German-language education was permitted once more. The region was called &quot;Trentino-Alto Adige/Tiroler Etschland&quot; between 1947 and 1972.

However, the implementation of the agreement was not seen as satisfactory by either the German-speaking population nor the Austrian government. The issue became the cause of significant friction between the two countries and was taken up by the United Nations in 1960. A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but proved unsuccessful, partly because of popular discontent and a campaign of terrorism and bombings by German-speaking autonomists and separatists led by the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee.

The issue was resolved in 1971, when a new Austro-Italian treaty was signed and ratified. It stipulated that disputes in South Tyrol would be submitted for settlement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, that the province would receive greater autonomy within Italy, and that Austria would not interfere in South Tyrol&#x27;s internal affairs. The new agreement proved broadly satisfactory to the parties involved and the separatist tensions soon eased. Matters were helped further by Austria&#x27;s accession to the European Union in 1995, which has helped to improve cross-border cooperation.

In May 2006, senator-for-life Francesco Cossiga introduced a bill that would allow the region to hold a referendum, in which the local electorate could decide whether to stay within the Italian Republic, become fully independent or return to Austria. All parties, including the separatists, rejected this measure as potentially causing a revival of ethnic tensions.

== Geography ==
The region is bordered by East and North Tyrol (Austria) to the north-east and north respectively, by Graubünden (Switzerland) to the north-west, and by the Italian regions of Lombardy to the west and Veneto to the south and southeast. It covers . It is extremely mountainous, covering a large part of the Dolomites and the southern Alps.

The region is composed of two provinces, Trentino in the south and South Tyrol in the north.

Trentino has an area of , most of it mountainous land (20% is over and 70% over 1,000 m) and covered by vast forests (50% of the territory). The climate is various through the province, from an alpine climate to subcontinental one, with warm and variable summers and cold and quite snowy winters. The region has always been a favourite destination for tourists, both in winter for skiing in the high mountains and in summer to visit the wide valleys and many lakes (the largest being Lake Garda).
South Tyrol has an area of , all of it mountainous land and covered by vast forests. The climate is of the continental type, owing to the influence of the many mountain ranges which stand at well over above sea level and the wide valleys through which flow the main river, the Adige, from north to south and its numerous tributaries. In the city of Bolzano, capital of the province, the average air temperature stands at and the average rainfall at . The lowest pass across the Alps, the Brenner Pass, is located at the far north of the region on the border with Austria.

== Politics ==


The region is divided into two autonomous provinces: Trentino (Autonomous Province of Trento) and South Tyrol (Autonomous Province of Bolzano). The Italian Republic recognised a certain degree of autonomy for the region and its two constituent provinces, which was the result of the Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement of 1946, as well as of the special status of autonomy approved by constitutional law in 1948. This statute gave the region the right to initiate its own laws on a wide range of subjects and to carry out respective administrative functions.

In 1972, the introduction of the second Statute of Autonomy, which was in the centre of the discussions between the Italian and Austrian governments, meant the transfer of the main competencies from the region to the two provinces. The autonomy recognized by the special statute covers the political, legislative, administrative, and fiscal institutions. The second statute turned the region &quot;de facto&quot; into a loose commonwealth with devolved powers to the two autonomous provinces, with very limited legislative or executive competencies left.

The capital city is Trento, although the two provincial capitals alternate biennially (the other being Bolzano) as the site of the regional assembly.

== Economy ==

The region&#x27;s fertile valleys produce wine, fruit, dairy products, and timber, while its industries include paper, chemical and metal production. The region is a major exporter of hydroelectric power. The most important features of the region&#x27;s economic structure are the strength of tourism and the special system of co-operation between agriculture and industry. In the last decade, tourism became a very important component of the province&#x27;s economy. The region, which is a staging-post between the countries of northern Europe and central and southern Italy, has found its true vocation in this leading branch of the services sector with all its spin-offs. The region has a higher concentration of hotels than any other region (6,178 establishments in 2001 with 236,864 hotel beds). The total accommodation capacity of the region counts for 651,426 beds available in hotels and other establishments.

Because of its unique history and location within the southern Alps and Dolomites, in this region grows a wide range of grape varieties that are not usually seen in other parts of Italy. These include Müller-Thurgau, Vernatsch, Lagrein, Sylvaner, Riesling (known in Italian as &quot;Riesling Renano&quot;), Gewürztraminer (known in Italian as &quot;Traminer Aromatico&quot;) and Blatterle. Winemaking in Tyrol has a long tradition: the first evidence dates back to the period before the Romans. The South Tyrolean winegrowing area is highly influenced by the Mediterranean climate, which in the Adige Valley (Überetsch-Unterland, Überetsch, Bozen, Terlan, Burggrafenamt) arrives up to Meran. This allows a very versatile winemaking, which includes almost all the red grape varieties and a lot of white grape wines. The Vinschgau and the Eisacktal have a harsher climate and thus they&#x27;re specialized in white wines. In South Tyrol there are three indigenous varieties: Schiava, Gewürztraminer and Lagrein. A similar winegrowing region is Trentino wine in the south.

Christmas in Italy begins on 8 December with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally Christmas trees are erected, and ends on 6 January of the following year with Epiphany. In Italy, the oldest Christmas market is considered to be that of Bologna, held for the first time in the 18th century and linked to the feast of Saint Lucia. The tradition of the markets has however spread in Italy predominantly especially since the 1990s, with the birth of the first modern markets: among these, the first ever was that of Bolzano, born in 1991, which was followed by others in South Tyrol, in particular in Merano, Brixen, Sterzing and Bruneck. The Trento Christmas market, established in 1993, is renowned in Trentino.

Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol has many small and picturesque villages, 16 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. These villages are:
*Bondone
*Borgo Valsugana
*Caldes
*Canale di Tenno
*Kastelruth
*Klausen
*Neumarkt
*Glurns
*Luserna
*Mezzano
*Ossana
*Pieve Tesino
*Rango
*San Giovanni di Fassa
*San Lorenzo in Banale
*Sterzing

== Demographics ==
The region has a population of about 1,072,276 people (541,098 in Trentino and 531,178 in South Tyrol). The population density in the region is low compared to Italy as a whole. In 2008, it equalled to , whereas the average figure for Italy was . The population density in Trentino was , slightly higher than the one registered in South Tyrol that was equal to . , the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that 90,321 foreigners lived in the region altogether, equal to 8.55% of the total regional population.

=== Languages ===

The main language groups are Italian and German, with small minorities speaking Ladin, Lombard, Mòcheno and Cimbrian. The latter two of which are varieties of the Upper German Bavarian dialect.

In Trentino the majority language is Italian, although there are Cimbrian minorities in the municipality of Luserna and four Mòcheno municipalities in the Mòcheni Valley. There are also Ladin-speaking minorities living in the Fassa Valley and in Non Valley (3.5% of the population). While in Fassa Valley Ladin already enjoys official status, in Non Valley it still does not, despite there being more Ladin speakers in the latter than in the former. Sole Valley also historically belongs to the Ladin area.

In South Tyrol the majority language is German (62% of the population), although in the capital city Bolzano 73% of the population speaks Italian as its maternal language due to internal immigration from other regions of Italy. Italian speakers are also a significant component in other major urban centres of the province, such as in Merano (49% Italian as the mother language) and Brixen (26% mother language). More than 90% of the 120,000 Italian speakers live in Bozen/Bolzano, Merano, Leifers and Brixen, and the greater part of the rest in the small towns south of the capital just north of the border with Trentino or scattered about in very small numbers throughout the rest of the province. The Italian language is a majority in 5 of 116 municipalities. Italian is the first language of 26% of the population (down from 35% in 1960) of the population of 453,000 recorded in the 2011 census, not counting the 51,000 who listed Language as &#x27;Other&#x27; who are immigrants. Ladin is the additional official language in some municipalities and a majority in 8. According to the census of 2001, 103 out of 116 communes have a majority of German native speakers, eight of Ladin speakers and five of Italian. Today both German and Italian have the status of co-official languages in South Tyrol.

== Transport ==


The infrastructure system of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol is made up of railway, airport, motorway, road and lake lines.

The main railway line consists of the Brenner Railway (; ), which runs along the Adige Valley from Trentino to Bolzano, and through the Isarco Valley at the end of the border with Austria (Brenner Pass). The Trento–Venice railway, the Trento–Malè–Mezzana railway, the Puster Valley Railway are minor. The Brenner Railway is a major line connecting the Austrian and Italian railways from Innsbruck to Verona, climbing up the Wipptal (German for &quot;Wipp Valley&quot;), passing over the Brenner Pass, descending down the Eisacktal (German for &quot;Eisack Valley&quot;) to Bolzano, then further down the Adige Valley to Rovereto, and along the section of the Adige Valley, called in Italian the &quot;Vallagarina&quot;, to Verona. This railway line is part of the Line 1 of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). It is considered a &quot;fundamental&quot; line by the state railways Ferrovie dello Stato (FS).

The Trentino-Alto Adige airport service is divided into the 3 large airports: Trento-Mattarello Airport, Bolzano Airport and Dobbiaco Airport. Trento-Mattarello Airport (, also known as &quot;Aeroporto G.Caproni&quot;, is an airfield located at &quot;Trentino&quot;, south of Trento, Italy. The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 18/36 with an asphalt surface measuring . Bolzano Airport (, ) is a regional airport near Bolzano in the province of South Tyrol in northern Italy. The airport was established in October 1926 with a landing runway. The Dobbiaco Airport lies approximately 1 km to the South of the village of Dobbiaco and is Italy&#x27;s northernmost and highest airport. The military airfield has a 700m long and 50m wide grass runway and is managed by the Italian Air Force&#x27;s Airport Detachment Toblach. On weekends and holidays from May to October the airport is open for civilian traffic.

The region is crossed by a single motorway, on the Autostrada A22. The Autostrada A22 or Autobrennero or Autostrada del Brennero (&quot;Brenner motorway&quot;; ) is one of the most important &quot;autostrada&quot; (Italian for &quot;motorway&quot;) in Italy, as it connects Po Valley, the city of Modena and the Autostrada A1 to Austria through the Brenner Pass, located in the municipality of Brenner. The Autostrada A22 is long. It is a part of the E45 European route. The operator of the road is Autostrada del Brennero S.p.A.. The Autostrada A22 is located in the regions of Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.

Another important artery of the Trentino-Alto Adige road is the Strada statale 12 dell&#x27;Abetone e del Brennero, which runs parallel to the Autostrada A22, and the Strada statale 38 dello Stelvio, which link Bolzano to Merano. Strada statale 12 dell&#x27;Abetone e del Brennero (SS 12) is an Italian state highway long in Italy located in the regions of Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol that connects Pisa to the Austrian border at Brenner Pass. Strada statale 38 dello Stelvio (SS 38, ) is an Italian state highway long in Italy located in the regions of Lombardy and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol that connects Valtellina with the South Tyrolean Vinschgau via the Stelvio Pass ( meters), to continue in Etschtal until it reaches Bolzano.

Riva del Garda is connected to the other towns on Lake Garda via a regulated bank line.

== Symbols ==

The coat of arms quarters the arms of Trentino (black eagle) and the arms of South Tyrol (red eagle). The Flag of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol consists of a coat of arms, containing two eagles of San Venceslao (Trentino) and two Tyrolean red eagles (Alto Adige), historical symbols of the two provinces, which stand out against a white and blue background. The shape of the flag is a rectangle with a framed heraldic shield on it. Like other flags, the flag of Trentino-Alto Adige is also inspired, albeit differently, by the French flag introduced with the revolution of 1789. When Napoleon&#x27;s army crossed Italy, starting from March 1796, flags of tricolour style were adopted both by the various newborn Jacobin republics and by the military units that supported the French army. In the Alpine region, however, sketches of the two-tone known today began to emerge. Trentino-Alto Adige has been a region with a special statute since 1948. The two parts that make it up, the Province of Trento and the Province of Bolzano, in turn, constitute two provinces with particular prerogatives of autonomy defined in 1972. The white-blue flag, in use (limited) since 1995, takes up the characteristics of the banner, including the shield with quartered eagles from the province of Trento (1st and 4th) and that of Bolzano (2nd and 3rd). White and blue are the colours on which the coats of arms of Trento and Bolzano respectively were worn in ancient times. It has never been legally defined, unlike the coat of arms and the banner, approved on 17 September 1982 and approved by presidential decree of 21 March 1983. 
The flag has no ancient origins, and most likely derives from the French tricolour, with the colours in the flag and in the coat of arms. With the Austrian reoccupation of the area, completed in 1814 by Bellegarde against Beauharnais, and confirmed by the Congress of Vienna, the Trentino-Altoatesino bicolour was completely abandoned, defined as a symbol of the past Napoleonic regime. With regard to Trentino, the first public signal of Austrian intentions to dissolve the army of the Kingdom of Italy, consisted in the prohibition, issued by Bellegarde on 13 June 1814, of wearing tricolour cockades, which evidently were very widespread. Certainly, Francis II and Bellegarde were convinced that no other ties had matured in the meantime. There are various versions of the exact origin of the flag. One claims that the flag was created after World War I, while other says that it was all a coincidence, mainly because it was thought that such different ethnic groups, like the Austrians and the Italians, had never shared a territory. The flag of Trentino-Alto Adige has ancient origins in terms of its coat of arms. The eagle of St. Wenceslas, making up the coat of arms, was granted by John of Luxembourg on 9 August 1339. The rest of the flag consists of two horizontal bands of blue and white, with the coat of arms in the centre.

<text>Biliran, officially the Province of Biliran (Waray-Waray: &quot;Probinsya han Biliran&quot;; ; ), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region (Region VIII). Biliran is one of the country&#x27;s smallest and newest provinces. Formerly a sub-province of Leyte, it became an independent province in 1992.

Biliran lies less than a kilometer north of the island of Leyte. A bridge-causeway fixed link over Poro Island in the gateway town of Biliran connects the province to Leyte. Its capital is the municipality of Naval on the western coast of the island which is the most populous in the province.

==Etymology==
During the early Spanish era, what is now called Biliran was known as &quot;Isla de Panamao&quot;. The present name, believed to be adopted sometime between the late 17th century and the early 18th century, was, according to many publications, derived from a native grass called &quot;borobiliran&quot; which once grew abundantly on the island&#x27;s plains. A contending theory states that the name came from the word &quot;bilir&quot;, which was defined in an old Visayan dictionary to be the &quot;corner or edge of a boat, vase or anything protruding, like veins, or the furrow made by the plow.&quot; The dictionary also gives &quot;biliran&quot; as an alternate spelling for &quot;bilir&quot;. This theory is supported by the fact that Biliran was site of the first large-scale shipyard, built in the 17th century. Galleons were built to support the Galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco in Mexico.

==History==
===Spanish colonial period===
The first town, named Biliran, was founded in 1712 after petitioning for a municipality and parish status. During this time, the island was a part of Cebu Province. Biliran, together with the islands of Samar and Leyte, were constituted into a separate province in 1735. Later when Samar and Leyte were split into two provinces in 1768, Biliran became part of Leyte Province as its sub-province. The first parish priest, Gaspar Ignacio de Guevara, was assigned in 1765, but its parish status was apparently withdrawn because of Padre Gaspar&#x27;s apostasy. The parish was re-established on February 22, 1782.

====Moro raids====
In May 1735, representative inhabitants of Leyte petitioned Governor-General Fernando Valdes y Tamon to allow them to resettle Biliran Island. They claimed it had been abandoned for the past 50 years and was presently inhabited by &quot;bagamundo&quot;s (vagabonds) due to the frequent Moro raids.

On May 26, 1754, Moros destroyed Biliran and the town of Catbalogan in Samar. Panamao was reportedly razed to the ground and only the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; (mayor) of Biliran town escaped capture by the raiders. The old settlements of Caybiran, Mapuyo and Maripipi were also destroyed by the Moros.

The Moros staged their attack by marching inland along the Anas River for a distance of 1.5-2 leguas (leagues). Having covered part of the interior around a mountain, they managed to capture the inhabitants, with the exception of the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; who escaped. The houses and property of the natives were burned or destroyed. The church building suffered the same fate and its valuables were taken away by the raiders.

====Post-Muslim raids====
When the Muslim raiders were diminished in the early 19th century, Leytenians organized new towns in the present geography of Biliran Province.

In 1828, Caibiran on the east became an independent municipality and parish, the second to be created on Biliran Island.

Naval became the third town, carved out of the territory of Biliran town. It first became a separate parish in 1860. The Spanish colonial government officially recognized its municipality status on September 23, 1869, following the petition submitted around 1861.

Almeria became a separate town in 1886 and was named after the city of Almería in Spain.

Maripipi used to be a barrio of Naval. It was officially inaugurated as a town in 1867, two years ahead of its mother town, then folded up and was reduced into a barrio of Almeria, and then became a town again in 1899. Maripipi and the new towns of San Clemente (later Kawayan), Culaba and Esperanza (later Cabucgayan) were created around 1899 by the revolutionary government under President Emilio Aguinaldo.

===Japanese occupation era===

During the World War II, Biliran had its own guerrilla forces under the Leyte command of Colonel Ruperto Kangleon. The guerrilla operation was of invaluable assistance to the successful landing of the American liberation forces at Palo, Leyte, on October 20, 1944, just before the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

In 1945, Biliran was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 9th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army who landed in Biliran. Aided by the local guerrilla forces, they attacked the Japanese troops on the island during the Battle of Biliran during World War II.

===Philippine independence===
====Provincehood====
On April 8, 1959, &quot;Republic Act No. 2141&quot; was signed into law effectively making Biliran a sub-province of Leyte. The island became an independent province on May 11, 1992, through &quot;Republic Act No. 7160&quot;, making it one of the newest provinces in the country.

==Geography==
Biliran has a total land area of , making it the fourth smallest province in the Philippines. The island lies off the northern coast of Leyte island across Biliran Strait. To the southeast is Carigara Bay, to the northeast is the Samar Sea, and across this sea is Samar. To the west is the Visayan Sea and Masbate lies to the northwest. The province is composed of two major volcanic islands: the main island also named Biliran and Maripipi, a smaller island to the northwest. Other smaller islands include Higatangan and Dalutan.

===Topography===
The main volcanic island of Biliran features mountainous interiors with very narrow coastal areas. Only the municipalities of Naval and Caibiran have wide plains extending about from the coast suitable for agriculture. Mount Suiro, an inactive volcano, is the highest point on Biliran with an elevation of .

The only known historical volcanic activity at Biliran was a phreatic eruption and possible debris avalanche at a thermal area on September 26, 1939. Ashfalls were reported at Caibiran and adjoining areas with maximum deposits at thick. There are five active solfatara fields on the island. The solfatara on the west side of Mt. Giron contained more than 400 tones of sulfur in 1880.

Maripipi is a volcanic island with the Maripipi Volcano located in the center and the Municipality of Maripipi surrounding its shores and lower slopes. The volcano is classified as potentially active but has had no historical eruptions.

===Climate===
Biliran has a combination of warm and cool climatic zones, thus the prevailing climate is ideal for the cultivation of a wide range of agricultural crops. There is no distinct dry season but the heavy wet season generally occurs in December.
===Administrative divisions===
Biliran is subdivided into 8 municipalities, with a total of 132 barangays. All municipalities are located on Biliran Island, with the exception of Maripipi, which is an island municipality located to the northwest. The largest among the towns in terms of land area is the provincial capital Naval, while the smallest is Maripipi.


==Demographics==
The population of Biliran in the 2020 census was 179,312 people, with a density of .

Based on the May 2000 census, the province had a total population of 140,274, which made it the fifth least populous province in the country, and the smallest in the region. There were 27,907 households in the province with an average size of 5.02 persons, slightly higher than the national average of 4.99. 87.05% of the population was Roman Catholic.

===Languages===
Waray-Waray and Cebuano are the languages spoken by the majority of the people in Biliran Province. The latter is primarily spoken in Naval, Almeria and Kawayan. Whereas Waray-waray is spoken in the towns of Caibiran, Culaba, Cabucgayan, Biliran and Maripipi. Both are Visayan languages.

The majority of the residents also speak and understand English and Filipino.
==Economy==

The economy of Biliran is largely based on fishing. Most of its towns, especially Naval and Biliran, have excellent seaports. There are of brackish water fish ponds which produce prawns, shrimps and milkfish. Another of seawater are suitable for seaweed farming and 10 more hectares for fishcage culture.

Being mountainous, Biliran can support various agricultural crops. The warm lowlands are conducive to rice (&quot;palay&quot;) production and other tropical crops. The cool highlands are favorable to high-value crops such as cut flowers and varieties of upland vegetables.

The inhabitants also engage in hunting, lumber, and manufacturing. The principal raw material produced is copra and coconut oil. Processed goods include white clay ceramics, dried fish, raw gulaman, and citronella oil.

The untapped natural resources of the island include geothermal power and the abundant sulfur and gypsum deposits.

Major industries includes fashion bags, Romblon bags, baskets, shellcrafts, placemats, hot pads, beverage coasters and trays.

Biliran has been eyed as an emerging destination for mountaineers, bikers, canyoneers, hikers, and other adventure seekers. For example, Sampao River in the municipality of Almeria has been developed into a canyoning venue.

<doc id="246769" wikidata="Q4849238" url="?curid=246769" title="Baker v. Carr">
<text>Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that redistricting qualifies as a justiciable question under the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s equal protection clause, thus enabling federal courts to hear Fourteenth Amendment-based redistricting cases. The court summarized its &quot;Baker&quot; holding in a later decision as follows: &quot;the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the authority of a State Legislature in designing the geographical districts from which representatives are chosen either for the State Legislature or for the Federal House of Representatives.&quot; (&quot;Gray v. Sanders&quot;, ). The court had previously held in &quot;Gomillion v. Lightfoot&quot; that districting claims over racial discrimination could be brought under the Fifteenth Amendment.

The case arose from a lawsuit against the state of Tennessee, which had not conducted redistricting since 1901. Tennessee argued that the composition of legislative districts constituted a nonjusticiable political question, as the U.S. Supreme Court had held in &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot; (1946). In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. held that redistricting did not qualify as a political question, though he remanded the case to the federal district court for further proceedings. Justice Felix Frankfurter strongly dissented, arguing that the Court&#x27;s decision cast aside history and judicial restraint and violated the separation of powers between legislatures and courts.

The case did not have any immediate effect on electoral districts, but it set an important precedent regarding the power of federal courts to address redistricting. In 1964, the Supreme Court handed down two cases, &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; and &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, that required the United States House of Representatives and state legislatures to establish electoral districts of equal population on the principle of one person, one vote.

==Background==
Plaintiff Charles Baker was a Republican who lived in Shelby County, Tennessee, and had served as the mayor of Millington, near Memphis. The Tennessee State Constitution required that the Tennessee General Assembly&#x27;s legislative districts be redrawn every ten years to provide for districts of substantially equal population (as was to be done for congressional districts). Baker&#x27;s complaint was that Tennessee had not redistricted since 1901, in response to the 1900 census.

By the time of Baker&#x27;s lawsuit, the population had shifted such that his district in Shelby County had about ten times as many residents as some of the rural districts. Rural citizens&#x27; votes were thus overrepresented compared to those of urban citizens. Baker&#x27;s argument was that this discrepancy was causing him to fail to receive the &quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; the Fourteenth Amendment requires. Defendant Joe Carr was sued in his position as Tennessee Secretary of State. Carr was not the person who set the district lines – the state legislature had done that – but was sued &quot;ex officio&quot; as the person ultimately responsible for the conduct of elections in the state and the publication of district maps.

Tennessee argued that the composition of legislative districts was essentially a political question, not a judicial one, as had been held by &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot;, a plurality opinion of the Court in which Justice Felix Frankfurter declared that &quot;Courts ought not to enter this political thicket.&quot; Frankfurter believed that relief for legislative malapportionment had to be won through the political process.

==Decision==
The case had to be put over for reargument because in conference no clear majority emerged for either side of the case. During the case, Justice Charles Evans Whittaker recused himself for health reasons, ultimately retiring from the Court in 1962.

The opinion was finally handed down in March 1962, nearly a year after it was initially argued. The Court split 6 to 2 in ruling that Baker&#x27;s case was justiciable, producing, in addition to the opinion of the Court by Justice William J. Brennan, three concurring opinions and two dissenting opinions. Brennan reformulated the political question doctrine, identifying six factors to help in determining which questions are &quot;political&quot; in nature. Cases that are political in nature are marked by:
# &quot;Textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department&quot;; as an example, Brennan cited issues of foreign affairs and executive war powers, arguing that cases involving such matters would be &quot;political questions&quot;
# &quot;A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it&quot;;
# &quot;The impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion&quot;;
# &quot;The impossibility of a court&#x27;s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government&quot;;
# &quot;An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made&quot;; and
# &quot;The potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.&quot;

Justice Tom C. Clark switched his vote at the last minute to a concurrence on the substance of Baker&#x27;s claims, which would have enabled a majority that could have granted relief for Baker. Instead, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the District Court.

The large majority in this case can in many ways be attributed to Brennan, who convinced Justice Potter Stewart that the case was a narrow ruling dealing only with the right to challenge the statute. Brennan also talked down Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas from their usual absolutist positions to achieve a compromise.

==Dissent by Justices Frankfurter and Harlan==
Frankfurter, joined by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, dissented vigorously and at length, arguing that the Court had cast aside history and judicial restraint, and violated the separation of powers between legislatures and Courts. He wrote:
Appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted. But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful.

==Legacy==

Having declared redistricting issues justiciable in &quot;Baker&quot;, the court laid out a new test for evaluating such claims. The Court formulated the famous &quot;one person, one vote&quot; standard under American jurisprudence for legislative redistricting, holding that every person had to be weighted equally in legislative apportionment. This affected numerous state legislatures that had not redistricted congressional districts for decades, despite major population shifts. It also ultimately affected the composition of state legislative districts, which in Alabama and many other states had overrepresented rural districts and underrepresented urban districts with much greater populations.

This principle was formally enunciated in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964). The Court decided that in states with bicameral legislatures, like Alabama, the state in this case, both houses had to be apportioned on this standard. This voided the Alabama Constitution&#x27;s provision for two state senators from each county and similar provisions elsewhere. Similarly, the Tennessee Constitution prevented counties from being split and portions of a county from being attached to other counties or parts of counties in creating a legislative district. This was overridden on the principle of basing districts on population. Today counties are frequently split among districts in forming Tennessee State Senate districts. &quot;One person, one vote&quot; was first applied as a standard for Congressional districts in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot;. State legislatures were supposed to redistrict according to population changes, but many had not for decades.

&quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; and subsequent cases fundamentally changed the nature of political representation in the United States, requiring not just Tennessee but nearly every state to redistrict during the 1960s, often several times. This reapportionment increased urban areas&#x27; political power and reduced that of more rural areas. After he left the Court, Chief Justice Earl Warren called the &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; line of cases the most important in his tenure as Chief.

<text>Josiah Henson (June 15, 1789 – May 5, 1883) was an author, abolitionist, and minister. Born into slavery, in Port Tobacco, Charles County, Maryland, he escaped to Upper Canada (now Ontario) in 1830, and founded a settlement and laborer&#x27;s school for other fugitive slaves at Dawn, near Dresden, in Kent County, Upper Canada, of Ontario. Henson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself&quot; (1849), is believed to have inspired the title character of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s 1852 novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852). Following the success of Stowe&#x27;s novel, Henson issued an expanded version of his memoir in 1858, &quot;Truth Stranger Than Fiction. Father Henson&#x27;s Story of His Own Life&quot; (published Boston: John P. Jewett &amp; Company, 1858). Interest in his life continued, and nearly two decades later, his life story was updated and published as &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Story of His Life: An Autobiography of the Rev. Josiah Henson&quot; (1876).

==Early life==

Josiah Henson was born on a farm near Port Tobacco, Charles County, Maryland, on a plantation owned by Francis Newman, where Henson experienced slave atrocities. Henson&#x27;s father was enslaved by Francis Newman whereas Josiah Henson, his mother, and his siblings were enslaved by Dr. Josiah McPherson. When he was a boy, his father was punished for standing up to a slave overseer, for which he received one hundred lashes. In addition, his right ear was nailed to the whipping post and then cut off. His father was sold away to Alabama. Josiah Henson experienced hardships and sufferings at the hands of his masters as well, including having his arms broken and an injury to his back. Following his family&#x27;s master&#x27;s death, young Josiah was separated from his mother, brothers, and sisters. At the slave auction, Henson&#x27;s siblings were sold first. His mother was bought by Issac Riley of Montgomery County and when she pleaded to her new owner to purchase Josiah Henson, Riley responded by hitting and kicking her. Josiah Henson was sold to Adam Robb of Rockville, Montgomery County. Adam Robb encountered Issac Riley and struck a deal which resulted in Henson being sold to Riley and reunited with his mother. Josiah Henson became very ill. His mother pleaded with her owner, Isaac Riley, and Riley agreed to buy back Henson so she could at least have her youngest child with her, on the condition that he would work in the fields.

Riley would not regret his decision, for Henson rose in his owners&#x27; esteem, and was eventually entrusted as the supervisor of his master&#x27;s farm, located in Montgomery County, Maryland (in what is now North Bethesda). In 1825 Riley fell into economic ruin and was sued by a brother-in-law. Desperate, he begged Henson, with tears in his eyes, to promise to help him. Henson agreed. Riley told him that he needed to take his eighteen slaves to his brother in Kentucky by foot. They arrived in Owensboro, Daviess County, Kentucky, in the middle of April 1825 at the plantation of Amos Riley.
In September 1828, Henson returned to Maryland and attempted to buy his freedom from Riley. with $350 he had saved, along with a note promising a further $100. Riley, however, added an extra zero to the paper, changing the promissory fee to $1000. Soon after, Henson learned that Riley planned to sell him in New Orleans, Louisiana, separating him from his wife and four children. Henson became determined to escape to Canada and freedom. He took his wife and their children.

== Escape from slavery ==
After convincing his wife to escape with him, Henson&#x27;s wife created a knapsack large enough to carry both of their smallest children; the eldest two would accompany his wife. The Henson family left Kentucky, travelling through the night, and sleeping in the woods throughout the day. They crossed into Indiana, then into Cincinnati, where they were safely welcomed in a home for a few days. As the Henson family was crossing Hull&#x27;s Road in Ohio, Josiah&#x27;s wife fainted from exhaustion. As they continued on, they encountered Indians, and were reinvigorated with food and rest. After crossing a lake in Ohio, Josiah encountered Captain Burnham, a ship captain, who agreed to transport the Henson family to Buffalo, New York; from there they would cross the river into Canada. Upon setting foot into Canada, Josiah Henson described the ecstatic feelings of liberation by throwing himself onto the ground and rejoicing with his family. On October 28, 1830, Josiah Henson became a liberated man.  

===Slavery policy in Canada===
Upper Canada had become a refuge for slaves who had escaped from the United States after 1793, when Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe passed &quot;An Act to prevent the further introduction of Slaves, and limit the Term of Contracts for Servitude within this Province&quot; . The legislation did not immediately end slavery in the colony, but it did prevent the importation of slaves. As a result, any U.S. slave who set foot in what would eventually become Ontario, was free.

==Later life==
Josiah Henson first worked on farms near Fort Erie, then Waterloo Ontario, moving with friends to Colchester in 1834 to set up a Black settlement on rented land. After earning enough, Henson was able to send his eldest son Tom to school, who in turn taught Josiah how to read. Henson became literate and was able to lead the growing community of fugitive slaves in Canada. Through contacts and financial assistance there, he was able to purchase in Dawn Township, in neighbouring Kent County, to realize his vision of a self-sufficient community. The Dawn Settlement eventually reached a population of 500 at its height, exporting black walnut lumber to the United States and Britain. Henson purchased an additional next to the Settlement, where his family lived. Henson also became an active Methodist preacher and spoke as an abolitionist on routes between Tennessee and Ontario. He also served in the Canadian Militia as a military officer, having led a Black militia unit in the Canadian Rebellion of 1837. In 1838, Henson and the militia successfully captured the rebel ship Anne, cutting off their supply lines to southwestern Upper Canada. Though many residents of the Dawn Settlement returned to the United States after slavery was abolished there, Henson and his wife continued to live in Dawn for the rest of their lives. Henson became the spiritual leader within the community and embarked on several trips to the United States and Great Britain where he met with Queen Victoria. While in Britain, Josiah publicly spoke to audiences and raised funds for the community back in Canada. Henson conducted several trips back to Kentucky to guide other slaves to freedom.

In 1878, Rev. Henson was described as &quot;a jovial old man&quot;, who &quot;considering his age is pretty active&quot;.

Henson was a Freemason.

==Miscellaneous==
Josiah Henson is the first black man to be featured on a Canadian stamp. He was also recognized by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada in 1999 as a National Historic Person. A federal plaque to him is located in the Henson family cemetery, next to Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin Historic Site.

A 2018 documentary titled &quot;Redeeming Uncle Tom: The Josiah Henson Story&quot; covers his life.

In 1978 plans were announced in Owensboro to recognize Henson with a memorial site in the city, but the recession of the 1980s put that plan on indefinite hold. In 1991, a playwright was hired to create a drama based on Henson&#x27;s Daviess County years; in the summer of 1993, &quot;Josiah&quot; was staged at the RiverPark Center in Owensboro and its six-night run drew more than 4,000 people.

==Historic sites==

===Josiah Henson Museum &amp; Park—North Bethesda, Maryland===

The actual cabin in which Henson and other slaves were housed no longer exists; it was demolished along with other outbuildings in the 1950s when much of the former Riley plantation was developed into suburban tract housing. The Riley family house, however, remains and is currently in a residential development in Rockville, Montgomery County, Maryland. After remaining in the hands of private owners for nearly two centuries, on January 6, 2006, the Montgomery Planning Board agreed to purchase the property and the acre of land on which it stands for $1,000,000 (~$ in ). The house was opened to the public for one weekend in 2006. In March 2009, the site received an additional $50,000 from the Maryland state Board of Public Works for the planning and design phase of a multiyear restoration project. An additional $100,000 may come from the Federal government that would go towards restoration and planning. The site was planned to be opened permanently to the public in 2012, until then offering guided tours four times a year.

As of 2018, the Josiah Henson Museum &amp; Park, in North Bethesda, Maryland, contains the Riley/Bolton house, where Henson&#x27;s owner lived. The Montgomery County park site (construction/restoration) reopened to the public on April 23, 2021, after the completion of the renovations and installation of new exhibits and building of the visitor center. &quot;Ongoing archaeological excavations seek to find where Josiah Henson may have lived on the site.&quot;

===The Josiah Henson Museum of African-Canadian History===
Located near Dresden, Ontario, in Canada, the Josiah Henson Museum of African-Canadian History formally called Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin Historic Site includes the cabin that was home to Josiah Henson during much of his time in the area, from 1841 until his death in 1883. The includes Henson&#x27;s cabin, an interpretive centre about Henson and the Dawn settlement, an exhibit gallery about the Underground Railroad, outbuildings, a 19th-century historic house, a cemetery and a gift shop.

<text>An abecedarium (also known as an abecedary or ABCs or simply an ABC) is an inscription consisting of the letters of an alphabet, almost always listed in order. Typically, abecedaria (or abecedaries) are practice exercises.

==Non-Latin alphabets==
Some abecedaria include obsolete letters which are not otherwise attested in inscriptions. For example, abecedaria in the Etruscan alphabet from Marsiliana (the Tuscan town) include the letters B, D, and O, which indicate sounds not present in the Etruscan language and are therefore not found in Etruscan inscriptions. Others, such as those known from Safaitic inscriptions, list the letters of the alphabet in different orders, suggesting that the script was casually rather than formally learned.

Some abecedaria found in the Athenian Agora appear to be deliberately incomplete, consisting of only the first three to six letters of the Greek alphabet, and these may have had a magical or ritual significance. A deliberately incomplete abecedarium found at Hymettos in Attica may have been a votive offering.

==Latin alphabet==
Near the beginning of the Christian era, the Latin alphabet had already undergone its principal changes, and had become a definite system. The Greek alphabet was growing closer to the Latin alphabet. Towards the 8th century of Rome, the letters assumed their artistic forms and lost their older, narrower ones. The three letters added by Emperor Claudius have never been found in use in Christian inscriptions. The letters fell into disuse after Claudius&#x27;s death. The alphabet used for monumental inscriptions was very different from the cursive. The uncial, occurring very rarely on sculptured monuments, and reserved for writing, did not appear until the 4th century. The majority of objects bearing the abecedaria are not of Christian origin, with the exception of two vases found at Carthage. These objects included tablets used by stone-cutters&#x27; apprentices while learning their trade. Stones have also been found in the catacombs, bearing the symbols A, B, C, etc. These are arranged, sometimes, in combinations which have puzzled scholars. One such stone, found in the cemetery of St. Alexander, in the Via Nomentana, is inscribed as follows:

 AXBVCTESDR . . . . . .BCCEECHI
 EQGPH. . . .M MNOPQ
 RSTVXYZ

This can be compared with a denarius of L. Cassius Caecinianus, which has the following inscription:

 AX, BV, CT, DS, ER, FQ, GP, HO, IN, LM

Jerome explained this similarity. Children were made to learn the alphabet in pairs of letters, joining the first letter of the alphabet with the last letter (AX), the second letter with the second to last (BV), and so on. A stone found at Rome in 1877, and dating from the 6th or 7th century, seems to have been used in a school, as a model for learning the alphabet, and points to the continuance of old methods of teaching.

==Ecclesiastical use==

An &quot;Abecedary&quot;, a full alphabet carved in stone or written in book form, was historically found in churches, monasteries and other ecclesiastical buildings. Abecedaries are generally considered to be medieval teaching aids, particularly for the illiterate. The alphabet may have been thought to possess supernatural powers along the lines of the runic alphabet. Each letter would have had a symbolic meaning to the devout.

An example, the first seven letters or so of which were found in 1967, is from the long demolished Church of St Mary of the Grey Friars in Dumfries, Scotland. In this case, the letters are inscribed in the Lombardic script of the 1260s and the complete structure would probably have stood near the high altar .

One of the oldest examples is now in use as a gravestone in Kilmalkedar, near Dingle, Ireland. It has the appearance of a standing stone and is known as the Alphabet Stone, displaying as it does an alphabet dating from early Christian times.

Abecedarian psalms and hymns exist, these are compositions like Psalm 119 in Hebrew, and the Akathist hymn in Greek, in which distinct stanzas or verses commence with successive letters of the alphabet.

&quot;The New England Primer&quot;, a schoolbook first printed in 17th-century Boston, includes an abecedary of rhyming couplets in iambic dimeter, beginning with:

:In Adam’s fall,
::We sinned all.
:Thy life to mend,
::This Book attend.
:The Cat doth play,
::And after slay.

<text>Mondino de Luzzi, or de Liuzzi or de Lucci, ( – 1326), also known as Mundinus, was an Italian physician, anatomist and professor of surgery, who lived and worked in Bologna. He is often credited as the restorer of anatomy because he made seminal contributions to the field by reintroducing the practice of public dissection of human cadavers and writing the first modern anatomical text.

==Life==
He was born around 1270 into the prominent Florentine de Luzzi family with loyalties to the Ghibellines and inscribed to the &quot;Società dei Toschi&quot;, a medieval institution of Bologna for people from Tuscany. His father, Nerino, and grandfather Albizzio were both pharmacists in Bologna, and his uncle Luzio (also Liuzzo or Lucio) was a professor of Medicine. Mondino studied at the University of Bologna in the College of Medicine and the College of Philosophy, graduated around 1290, and he was employed as a public lecturer in practical medicine and surgery at the university from 1306 to 1324. During his schooling, Mondino was a pupil of Thaddeus of Florence (Taddeo Alderotti), who made significant contributions to the development of medicine at Bologna, and a fellow student of Henri de Monteville. In addition to his achievements as an anatomist, Mondino was highly regarded as a diplomat. He was involved in city government and served as an Ambassador of Bologna to John, the son of King Robert of Naples. Mondino died in Bologna in 1326 and was buried in the parochial church of San Vitale e Agricola along with his uncle Leuzzo, who was also a lecturer in medicine. His granite tomb is adorned with a bas-relief, sculpted by Boso of Parma, which depicts an instructor seated in a large chair lecturing to students.

==Teaching methods==
Mondino was the first to incorporate a systematic study of anatomy and dissection into a medical curriculum. The dissection of human cadavers was a hallmark of the Alexandrian school, but declined after 200 A.D. due to legal and religious proscriptions. These bans were eventually lifted, allowing Mondino to perform his first public dissection in Bologna in January 1315 in the presence of medical students and other spectators; the subject was mostly likely a female executed criminal. It was common practice for the professor of anatomy to sit in a large, ornate chair elevated above the dissection proceedings, reading from an anatomical text and providing commentary, while a &quot;demonstrator&quot;, or surgeon, physically performed the dissection. Additionally, an &quot;ostensor&quot; was present to point out the specific parts of the body that were being examined. Mondino&#x27;s teaching methods were unique because he often performed dissections in person and served the role of demonstrator himself, carefully studying the cadaver and incorporating this personal experience into his text and teaching.

==Dissection theory==

His dissection practices were guided by his adherence to a tripartite division of the human body. He theorized that the body was composed of three distinct containers: the skull, or superior ventricle, which enclosed the &quot;animal members&quot;; the thorax, or middle ventricle, which contained &quot;spiritual members&quot; such as the heart and lungs; and finally the abdomen, or inferior ventricle, which housed &quot;natural members&quot; including the liver and other visceral organs. Mondino utilized the differences between animal, spiritual, and natural members to classify distinct aspects of physiological activity. He also asserted that certain parts of the body are innately superior to others; according to that hierarchical arrangement, the abdomen should be dissected first because its organs are &quot;the most confused and least noble&quot;, followed by the thorax, and finally the head, which contains &quot;higher and better organized&quot; anatomical structures. Additionally, Mondino argued that distinct dissection methods should be applied to simple structures (such as bones, muscles, nerves, veins, and arteries) as compared to more complex composite parts (for example, the eye, ear, liver, and spleen. He also suggested that when to study the muscles of the limbs, a sun-dried body be used as an alternative to the more laborious practice of dissecting a rapidly-decaying cadaver.

==Contributions to anatomy==
Mondino&#x27;s major work, &quot;Anathomia corporis humani&quot;, written in 1316, is considered the first example of a modern dissection manual and the first true anatomical text. The earliest edition of the work was printed in Padua between 1475 and 1478, and more than 40 editions are thought to exist. By the 14th century, the practice of anatomy had come to involve the dissection of a cadaver according to prescribed rules; &quot;Anathomia&quot; was intended as a handbook to guide this process. &quot;Anathomia&quot; remained the most widely used anatomical text for 250 years (through the 16th century) because it clearly and concisely provided the important technical indications involved in the dissection process, including the steps involved and the reasoning behind the organization of these procedures. Unlike his predecessors, Mondino focuses specifically on anatomical descriptions rather than engaging in a larger discourse on pathology and surgery in general.

&quot;Anathomia&quot; opens with the assertion that human beings are superior to all other creatures because of their intellect, reasoning ability, tool-making abilities, and upright stature; because he possesses these noble qualities, man is worthy to be studied. Mondino goes on to describe the organs in the order in which they present themselves during the dissection process. Dissection began with the opening of the abdominal cavity via vertical incision running from the stomach to the pectoral muscles and a horizontal cut above the navel. First, the musculature of the intestinal tract is described in detail, followed by an extensive discussion of the form, function, and position of the stomach. According to the text, the stomach is spherical; the stomach wall has an internal lining, which is &quot;the seat of sensation&quot;, and an external fleshy coat that is involved in digestion. In order to access the spleen, which was thought to secrete black bile into the stomach through imaginary canals, the dissector was required to remove the &quot;false ribs&quot;. The liver is said to have five lobes, the gallbladder is described as the seat of yellow bile, and the cecum is described with no mention of the vermiform appendix. Though &quot;Anathomia&quot; only vaguely describes the pancreas, the pancreatic duct is discussed in greater detail. He also makes new observations regarding the anatomy of the bladder and the enlargement of the uterus during both menstruation and pregnancy.
Mondino&#x27;s description of the human heart, though inaccurate, is fairly detailed. He discusses three chambers: the right ventricle, the left ventricle, and a middle ventricle within the septum. The right ventricle is purported to contain a large opening, through which the heart draws blood originating in the liver, as well as the opening of the &quot;vena arterialis&quot; toward the lung. The left ventricle contains an orifice with three valves and the bivalvular opening of the &quot;arteria venalis&quot;, which allows the passage of a smoke-like vapor from the lungs. Despite these anatomical shortcomings, the &quot;vena chili&quot; (Mondino&#x27;s name for the vena cava) is noteworthy in its accuracy. He then moves on to the lungs, describing the course of the &quot;vena arterialis&quot; (pulmonary artery) and the &quot;arteria venalis&quot; (pulmonary vein). This section of &quot;Anathomia&quot; also describes the pleura and notes the importance of distinguishing between pulmonary pathologies including true pleurisy, false pleurisy, and pneumonia. His descriptions of the larynx and epiglottis are very rudimentary.

Mondino describes the closure of an incised intestinal wound by having large ants bite on its edges and then cutting off their heads, which one scholar interprets as an anticipation of the use of staples in surgery. &quot;Anathomia&quot; also includes a detailed passage on the surgical treatment of a hernia, both with and without castration, as well as a description of a type of cataract surgery.
Mondino&#x27;s treatment of the skull provides only inexact directions for its dissection, suggesting that the cranial cavity was opened infrequently and with little technical skill. Nonetheless, &quot;Anathomia&quot; contains a description of the cranial nerves derived from Galen&#x27;s &quot;Uses of the parts of the body of man&quot;. Furthermore, the brain is divided into three vesicles, with the anterior vesicle serving as the meeting place of the senses, the middle vesicle housing the imagination, and the posterior vesicle containing the memory. Movement of the choroid plexus is said to control mental processes by opening and closing passages between the ventricles. Mondino follows Galen and the Islamic commentators in placing the lens in the center of the eye.

Much of the medical information included in &quot;Anathomia&quot; is derived from commentaries on Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen written by Islamic scholars. Although Mondino makes frequent references to his personal dissection experiences, he nonetheless repeats numerous fallacies reported by these textual authorities. For example, he propagates the incorrect Galenic notion that a &quot;rete mirabile&quot; (&quot;miraculous network&quot;) of blood vessels exists at the base of the human brain when it is in fact present only in ungulates. Other errors contained in &quot;Anathomia&quot; are the result of an attempt to reconcile the teachings of Galen and Aristotle. This is exemplified by Mondino&#x27;s description of the heart: he combines Aristotle&#x27;s notion of a triventricular heart with Galen&#x27;s claim that a portion of the blood can flow directly from one side of the heart to the other though a permeable interventricular septum. He also propagates information about the human reproductive system that is not corroborated by anatomical evidence, including the existence of a seven-celled uterus with hornlike appendages.

==Legacy==
He made lasting, even if not entirely accurate, contributions to the fields of anatomy and physiology. &quot;Anathomia&quot; quickly became a classic text and, after his death, Mondino was regarded as a &quot;divine master&quot; to such an extent that anything differing from the descriptions in his book was regarded as anomalous or even monstrous. For three centuries, the statutes of many medical schools required lecturers on anatomy to use &quot;Anathomia&quot; as their textbook. Jacopo Berengario da Carpi, a 16th-century professor of anatomy at Bologna, wrote an extensive commentary on Mondino&#x27;s work, and the text of Anathomia was incorporated into Ketham&#x27;s 1493 text &quot;Fasciculus medicinae&quot;.

<text>is a Japanese science fiction mecha anime media franchise/media mix, created by Studio Nue (most prominently mecha designer, writer and producer Shōji Kawamori) and Artland in 1982. The franchise features a fictional history of Earth and the human race after the year 1999, as well as the history of humanoid civilization in the Milky Way. It consists of four TV series, four movies, six OVAs, one light novel, and five manga series, all sponsored by , in addition to 40 video games set in the &quot;Macross&quot; universe, two crossover games, and a wide variety of physical merchandise.

Within the series, the term &quot;Macross&quot; is used to denote the main capital ship. This theme began in the original &quot;Macross&quot;, &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;.

&quot;Overtechnology&quot; refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship ASS-1 (&quot;Alien Star Ship - One&quot; later renamed &quot;Super Dimension Fortress - One Macross&quot;) that crashed on &quot;South Ataria&quot; island. Humans were able to reverse engineer the technology to create the mecha (variable fighters and destroids), faster-than-light space fold drive for starships and other advanced technologies that the series features.

==Title==

The series title comes from the name of the main human spacecraft (which is usually shortened from &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; to &quot;SDF-1&quot; or &quot;The Macross&quot; as it is the first). The original name for the &quot;Macross&quot; project was &quot;Battle City Megarōdo&quot; (or &quot;Battle City Megaroad&quot;, as the Japanese transliteration to either &quot;L&quot; or &quot;R&quot; gives the title a double meaning in reference to the story line: &quot;Megaload&quot;, referring to the spacecraft containing an entire city of people; and &quot;Megaroad&quot;, referring to the long journey through space back to Earth); however, one of the sponsors of the project, Big West Advertising, was a fan of Shakespeare and wanted the series and the spacecraft to be named . A compromise was made with the title due to its similar pronunciation to &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Japanese and because it still contained connotations to the original title. The word &quot;Macross&quot; comes from a wordplay combination of the prefix &quot;macro&quot; in reference to its massive size in comparison to human vehicles (though when compared with the alien ships in the series, it is a relatively small gun destroyer) and the distance they must cross.

==Themes==
The following are themes commonly seen and established among the various series in the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise.

===U.N. Spacy===

The is a fictional space military arm of the . It was established by the successor to the modern United Nations in order to defend Earth from a possible attack by hostile aliens, and was involved in Space War I against an extraterrestrial race called the Zentradi. Later operations of the U.N. Spacy expanded into interstellar colonization and general peacekeeping of off-world Earth settlements.

The term &quot;Spacy&quot; is a portmanteau of the terms &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Army&quot; or &quot;Navy&quot;. Some Japanese sources also use the term &quot;Space Army&quot; and some English-language sources use the term &quot;Space Navy&quot;, suggesting that the term is a contraction.

===Variable fighters===
The valkyrie fighter is one of a series of transformable aerospace fighters, primarily designed by franchise creator Shōji Kawamori and Kazutaka Miyatake. They are generally able to transform into jet/space fighters, Battroid (a humanoid robot) and a hybrid of the two modes, called Gerwalk (Ground Effective Reinforcement of Winged Armament with Locomotive Knee-joint). The VF-1 was specifically named &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, but all of the jet fighter craft have generically been referred to as such in the series since then.

===Music===
Music is integral part to almost every &quot;Macross&quot; title by having significances in a series&#x27; antagonists behavior towards it. Music idols also play a central role to various &quot;Macross&quot; stories. Often, the protagonist will be involved in a love triangle with a series&#x27; music idol; most notably, Lynn Minmay.

===Space fold===
Space folding permits nearly-instantaneous ultra-long distance travel: a space-fold transports a spacecraft in a very short amount of time by first swapping the location of the spacecraft with &quot;super dimension&quot; space or subspace, and then swapping the &quot;Super Dimension&quot; space with the space at the destination. 
According to U.N. Spacy First Lieutenant Hayase Misa during Space War I (2009–2012) an hour passes in super dimension space as approximately ten days passes in normal space. One of the latest &quot;Macross&quot; TV series, &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;, further expands on that concept by introducing fold faults or dislocations, which further retard fold travel and interfere with fold communications. Also explained in &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; are the limitations of space folding, such as the geometric increase in energy requirement with the mass of the object to be folded, which prevents very large objects from being folded with ease across vast distances.

The act of entering &quot;Super Dimension&quot; space is called &quot;fold in&quot;. When arriving at the destination, the act of leaving &quot;Super Dimension&quot; space is called a &quot;defold&quot; or a &quot;fold out&quot;.

===Ancient astronauts===
The metaplot of the franchise is centered on a purportedly extinct humanoid alien race called the . It was first conceptualized during the pre-production of &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; when the creators were researching cultural studies to develop concepts used in the plot.

According to official sources, the Protoculture was the first advanced humanoid race in the universe—advanced Protoculture civilization started 500,000 years ago—and is the creator of the Zentradi and homo sapiens. Phases of colonization resulted in the establishment of an &quot;Interstellar Republic&quot;, (similar to a galactic empire) which covers much of the Milky Way galaxy 2800 years after Protoculture civilization started (498,000 years ago).

A civil war happened sixty years later, resulting in a split in the Republic. One of the factions&#x27; created &quot;super-Zentradi&quot; forces, which was later possessed by interdimensional beings—these forces are later called the &quot;Protodeviln&quot;, which feeds on life energy of both Protoculture and Zentradi; some of both the Protoculture and Zentradi was later brainwashed into the &quot;Supervision Army&quot;.

The Supervision Army continued to battle both the Protoculture and Zentradi, which resulted in the dwindling of Protoculture population; they revoked the prime directive that banned Zentradi to attack the Supervision Army. This, however, made the war even more intense, and the Protoculture population sharply decreased; to avoid extinction, they seeded uninhabited planets by means of pantropy and avoided any conflict as much as possible. This action included the genetic engineering of homo sapiens on Earth by combining Protoculture genes with native genes; a &quot;sub-Protoculture&quot; race meant for preparing the Earth for a future Protoculture colonization. The genetic engineering crew, however, was immediately destroyed by anti-Interstellar Republic military ships.

The final blow of the war happened because of the Protoculture lost control of the Zentradi; 475,000 years ago, the Protoculture was believed extinct. However it was discovered that 10,000 years ago, the Protoculture remnants made contact with humans in &quot;Mayan Island&quot;, genetically re-engineering the native inhabitants to utilize the artifacts left by them. This included the &quot;Bird Human&quot; bio-mecha, tasked to destroy humanity if they are still in war.

===Other elements===
The franchise also explores minor themes including culture shock, capitalism, coming of age and nostalgia.

The new era following the end of Space War I is part of the ongoing fictional time-line of the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise. The most recent series, &quot;Macross Delta&quot;, is set 59 years after the start of the war with the Zentradi. Its main plot is about the spread of a rage virus on a star system and the combined efforts of singing idols and valkyrie fighters to stop it spreading.

Along with &quot;Gundam,&quot; a real robot mecha series of which Shoji Kawamori is a fan, &quot;Macross&quot; explored how individuals cope with warfare. Whereas &quot;Gundam&quot; is far more political and direct on the horrors of war, each &quot;Macross&quot; television series is unique for never depicting the antagonists as inherently evil and proved in the end that love, culture, and music can be used to resolve their conflicts.

==Series chronology==

Several sequel series and one prequel have followed. Most use a chronology created by the Studio Nue creators, and those that followed their own chronologies were regarded as &quot;parallel storylines&quot; by the studio. Several different studios were involved with Studio Nue in the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise along the years, but since 2002&#x27;s &quot;Macross Zero&quot;, production has been handled exclusively between Nue and Satelight, from which Shōji Kawamori is one of the main key members. The main of &quot;Macross&quot; production consists of (in chronological release order):
A feature film, subtitled &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; (愛・おぼえていますか &quot;Ai Oboete Imasu ka&quot;), was released in 1984, with a condensed version of the storyline and cutting-edge animation. This movie was later described as a &quot;historical drama&quot; movie within the &quot;Macross&quot; universe (similar to World War II films in the real world). In &quot;Macross Plus&quot; and &quot;Macross 7&quot;, it is revealed that there was a movie produced after Space War I (the original Earth-Zentradi conflict). Kawamori described the relation between the two depictions of Space War I: &quot;The real Macross is out there, somewhere. If I tell the story in the length of a TV series, it looks one way, and if I tell it as a movie-length story, it&#x27;s organized another way.&quot; (An edited, English-dubbed version of the feature was also released to video as &quot;Clash of the Bionoids&quot;.)

&quot;Macross II&quot;, the only animated project without Studio Nue&#x27;s direct involvement, was declared by Studio Nue to be a parallel-world story.

In March 2007, Studio Victor placed a casting call for a voice actress to play the heroine Ranka Lee, in a then untitled new &quot;Macross&quot; series. Eighteen-year-old Megumi Nakajima selected in the nationwide singing and acting audition for the role of Ranka Lee in Japan. The project was given the tentative title of &quot;Macross 25&quot;. Later, as part of the 25th anniversary concert, a trailer was shown that revealed the new tentative title of &quot;Macross F (Frontier)&quot;. During the concert, Kawamori Shoji mentioned that the timeframe of &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; was about 2070 AD. Kawamori also announced that Yoko Kanno would be the music co-composer of the new &quot;Macross&quot; series. According to &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine, this new series were supposed to take place in a school. The pilot episode aired on December 23, 2007. The new series were finally set in the year 2059 AD and took place in a new Macross Colony Fleet called &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;. The new show was produced by Satelight and its episodes began their regular broadcast on April 4, 2008, in MBS channel of Japan. The final episode aired on September 25, 2008, what brought the series to a total of 25 episodes. A &quot;Macross Frontier Movie Edition&quot; was announced just after the ending of the new TV animated series.

The Kanto area rerun of the &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; anime television series during early 2014 in Japan ended with a teaser announcement that a new &quot;Macross&quot; TV series is in the works, and later in the year was tentatively titled &quot;Macross Δ (Delta)&quot;. Just like for &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;, a casting call was held for the series&#x27; main singer who also became part of the cast. The winner of the contest as well of the rest of the cast and characters were revealed in a special event held on October 29, 2015. A new &quot;Macross&quot; anime television series was to premiere in 2018, but still hasn&#x27;t released (as of September 2024). A new &quot;Macross&quot; series was announced in 2023 to be animated by Bandai Namco Filmworks. It is unknown if this is the previously announced 2018 anime or if this is a completely new project.

Several sequel series and prequels have followed in &quot;Macross&quot;. The main &quot;Macross&quot; productions consists of (in fictional chronological timeline order):
==Video games==

&quot;Macross&quot; video games are based on its universe, sometimes expanding it with original characters and sidestories; latest games often include newly created anime footage, and all of them were exclusively released in Japan; except a Takatoku Toys handheld electronic game distributed by Incoming Trading, a Banpresto arcade game licensed by Fabtek, and a Bandai Visual PlayStation game whose debuted North American localization was eventually cancelled probably due to copyrights issues involving Harmony Gold.

See the list of &quot;Macross&quot; video games for all the official and crossover releases from the 1980s up to the 2010s.

==Legal complications with international distribution==

Harmony Gold purchased the international distribution rights for the &quot;Macross&quot; series and between 1999 and 2003 filed trademarks on the distribution of &quot;Macross&quot; merchandise and media outside of Japan. Harmony Gold&#x27;s international distribution rights are under dispute however as they bought the rights from the Japanese company, Tatsunoko Production, which in a court ruling against companies, Studio Nue and Big West, was ruled to have only the rights to the international distribution of &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; and no legal claim to the rest of the franchise; those belonging to the latter companies. Harmony Gold claims that the case does not apply to them since it occurred in Japan and does not apply to the international distribution rights. Harmony Gold continued to re-affirm their claim to the international distribution through cease and desist letters, resulting in later &quot;Macross&quot; series not being distributed outside of Japan.

On March 1, 2021, Big West, Studio Nue, and Harmony Gold came to an agreement. Harmony Gold would no longer hinder Big West&#x27;s distribution of &quot;Macross&quot; properties outside Japan and Harmony Gold would be allowed to release their upcoming &quot;Robotech&quot; film in Japan.

On March 18, 2024, Macross would be available via Disney+ for streaming worldwide (via the Star hub), with the exception of both the &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; that was currently available in Japan.

==Legacy==
&quot;Macross&quot; was the basis for the &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise in North America. &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; was adapted into the first saga of the &quot;Robotech&quot; television series (19851986), called &quot;The Macross Saga&quot;, which spawned the &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise. &quot;Robotech&quot; was influential in the Western world, helping to introduce the anime medium to North America.

&quot;Macross&quot; popularized the concept of transforming mecha, which can transform between a standard vehicle (such as a fighter plane or transport truck) and a fighting mecha robot. Shōji Kawamori introduced the concept with &quot;Diaclone&quot; in 1980 and then popularized it with &quot;Macross&quot;. Kawamori then went on to design transforming mecha for &quot;Transformers&quot; (1986). The transforming mecha concept became popular in the mid-1980s, with &quot;&quot; (1984) and &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; (1985) in Japan, and with &quot;Robotech&quot; and &quot;Transformers&quot; in the West. &quot;Transformers&quot; went on to influence the Hollywood movie industry.

In contrast to earlier mecha anime which focused on combatants, &quot;Macross&quot; portrayed mecha conflict from the perspective of non-combatant civilians, such as the singer Lynn Minmay. Voiced by Mari Iijima, Minmay was the first fictional idol singer to garner major real-world success, with the theme song &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; (from the film &quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot;) reaching number seven on the Oricon music charts in Japan. This was later further explored in &quot;Macross Plus&quot; with the virtual idol Sharon Apple, an artificial intelligence (AI) computer program who takes the form of an intergalactic pop star, and in &quot;Macross 7&quot; with the virtual band Fire Bomber who became a commercial success and spawned multiple CDs released in Japan. &quot;Macross&quot; set the template for later virtual idols in the early 21st century, such as Hatsune Miku and Kizuna Ai.

Another innovative character concept in &quot;Macross&quot; was the role of Misa Hayase in &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, who was one of the main commanders of the Macross battleship. She was the boss and commanding officer of the fighter pilot protagonist Hikaru Ichijyo, and later his love interest. This was a scenario Kawamori came up with which he had not seen in any Hollywood movies before. A similar scenario, however, later appeared in the Hollywood movie &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986). According to Kawamori, &quot;Many people pointed out that later films like &quot;Top Gun&quot; copied that idea and setting, as well as including the combination of many songs and fighters too.&quot;

<text>The Giro d&#x27;Italia (; ), also known simply as the Giro, is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also starting in, or passing through, other countries. The first race was organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, and the race is still run by a subsidiary of that paper&#x27;s owner. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1909, except during the two world wars. As the Giro gained prominence and popularity, the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian participation to riders from all over the world. The Giro is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with some additional teams invited as &#x27;wild cards&#x27;.

The Giro is one of professional cycling&#x27;s three-week-long Grand Tours, and after the &quot;Tour de France&quot; is the second most important stage race in the world (the Triple Crown of Cycling denotes the achievement of winning the Giro, the Tour and the UCI Road World Championships in the same season). The Giro is usually held during May, sometimes continuing into early June. While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same, with at least two time trials, and a passage through the mountains of the Alps, including the Dolomites. Like the other Grand Tours, the modern editions of the Giro d&#x27;Italia normally consist of 21 stages over a 23- or 24-day period that includes two or three rest days.

The rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the general classification and wears the pink jersey. While the general classification gathers the most attention, stage wins are prestigious of themselves, and there are other contests held within the Giro: the points classification, the mountains classification for the climbers, young rider classification for the riders under the age of 25, and the team classification.

==History==
===Origins and first race (1909)===

The idea of holding a bicycle race that navigated around Italy was inspired by the Tour de France and the success that &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; had gained from it. It was first suggested when &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; editor Tullo Morgagni sent a telegram to the paper&#x27;s owner, Emilio Costamagna, and cycling editor, Armando Cougnet, stating the need for an Italian tour. At the time &quot;La Gazzetta&quot;″s rival, &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; was planning on holding a bicycle race of its own, after the success they had gained from holding an automobile race. Morgagni then decided to try and hold their race before &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; could hold theirs, but &quot;La Gazzetta&quot; lacked the money. However, after the success &quot;La Gazzetta&quot; had with creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San Remo, the owner Costamagna decided to go through with the idea. Their bike race was announced on 7 August 1908 in the first page of that day&#x27;s edition of &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. The race was to be held in May 1909.

Since the organizers lacked the 25,000 lire needed to hold the race, they consulted Primo Bongrani, an accountant at the bank Cassa di Risparmio and friend of the three organizers. Bongrani proceeded to go around Italy asking for donations to help hold the race. Bongrani&#x27;s efforts were largely successful, he had procured enough money to cover the operating costs. Prize money was supplied by a casino in San Remo who Francesco Sghirla, a former &quot;Gazzetta&quot; employee, encouraged to contribute to the race. Even &quot;Corriere&quot;, &quot;La Gazzetta&quot;″s rival, gave 3,000 lire to the race&#x27;s fund.

On 13 May 1909 at 02:53, 127 riders started the first Giro d&#x27;Italia at Loreto Place in Milan. The race was split into eight stages covering . A total of 49 riders finished, with Italian Luigi Ganna winning. Ganna won three individual stages and the General Classification. Ganna received 5,325 lire as a winner&#x27;s prize, with the last rider in the general classification receiving 300 lire. The Giro&#x27;s director received only 150 lire a month, 150 lire fewer than the last-placed rider. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, who had the fewest total points at the end of the race.

===1910–1952===
The same format was used for the next two years and resulted in Carlo Galetti winning.

In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead there was only a team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time at the end of the race would win.

The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.

The dominant figure in the 1920s was Alfredo Binda, who won his first Giro in 1925 and followed this up with another victory in 1927, in which he won 12 of the 15 stages. Victory in 1929 came courtesy of eight successive stage wins. At the height of his dominance Binda was called to the head office of &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; in 1930; the newspaper accused him of ruining the race and offered him 22,000 lire to be less dominant, which he refused. Binda won five Giros before he was usurped as the dominant cyclist by Gino Bartali.

Nicknamed the &quot;Iron Man of Tuscany&quot; for his endurance, Bartali won two Giros during the 1930s, in 1936 and 1937. Bartali&#x27;s dominance was challenged in 1940, the last Giro before the Second World War, when he was defeated by his 20-year-old teammate Fausto Coppi.
Bartali and Coppi&#x27;s rivalry divided Italy. Bartali, a conservative, was venerated in the rural, agrarian south, while Coppi, more worldly, secular, innovative in diet and training, was a hero of the industrial north. They became teammates in 1940 when Eberrardo Pavesi, head of the Legnano team, took on Coppi to ride for Bartali. Bartali thought Coppi was &quot;as thin as a mutton bone&quot;, but accepted. Their rivalry started when Coppi, the helper, won the Giro aged 20 and Bartali, the star, marshalled the two men&#x27;s team to chase him.

The rivalry between Bartali and Coppi intensified after the war. Bartali won his last Giro in 1946, narrowly beating Coppi, now riding for the Bianchi team. Coppi then won his second Giro the following year. Coppi abandoned the 1948 Giro d&#x27;Italia in protest against the small penalty given to Fiorenzo Magni. Coppi won a further three Giros and twice, in 1949 and 1952, Coppi won the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France in the same year, the first rider to do so.

===1953–1967===

Swiss Hugo Koblet became the first non-Italian to win the race in 1950. No one dominated the tour during the 1950s, Coppi, Charly Gaul and Fiorenzo Magni each won two Giros during the decade.

The 1960s were similar. At the 1960 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Jacques Anquetil took advantage of a breakaway he was part of on stage 3 to take the overall lead. Anquetil then led the lead move to Jos Hoevenaers, who had been part of a breakaway on stage 6. In the long time trial of the race on stage 14, Anquetil retook the lead, finishing 1:27 minutes ahead of Baldini and more than 6 minutes on Gaul. His speed had been so fast that had the organizers applied the usual rules, 70 riders would have missed the time cut. In the event, the rules were loosened and only two riders eliminated. Ahead of the final mountain stages, Anquetil now led Nencini by 3:40 minutes, with Gaul in fifth, 7:32 minutes behind. Stage 20 included the Gavia Pass for the first time in the race&#x27;s history. On the ascent, Nencini was able to establish a gap to Anquetil, after the latter had a flat tire. More punctures and three bike changes followed on the dangerous descent, putting Anquetil&#x27;s race lead in danger. He teamed up with Agostino Coletto, whom he offered money to help him in the chase effort, to limit his losses. At the finish in Bormio, Gaul won ahead of Nencini, with Anquetil losing only 2:34 minutes and retaining the pink jersey by 28 seconds. Following a ceremonial final stage, Anquetil arrived in Milan the winner of the Giro for the first time. Anquetil went on to become the first rider to win all three Grand Tours and won the Giro again in 1964, while Franco Balmamion won two successive Giros in 1962 and 1963.

Felice Gimondi won the 1967 Giro d&#x27;Italia and went on to become the second rider, after Anquetil, to win all three Grand Tours.

===1968–1996 ===

Belgian Eddy Merckx was the dominant figure during the 1970s. His first victory came in 1968, a race which saw two important firsts: the first tests for drug use and the first prologue. A total of eight riders tested positive during the Giro. Belgian Eddy Merckx won his first Giro d&#x27;Italia after winning the twelfth stage&#x27;s finish atop the Tre Cime di Lavaredo and also regaining the race lead. En route to the overall victory, Merckx won four stages. Merckx returned in 1969 and was leading the race after the sixteenth stage that ended in Savona. Merckx tested positive for a banned substance after the stage and was subsequently disqualified from the race; to this day Merckx still proclaims his innocence. The UCI would lift his suspension almost immediately but Merckx was not allowed to start stage 17. Felice Gimondi took the lead after Merckx&#x27;s dismissal and held it all the way to the race&#x27;s conclusion.

Merckx came back the following year to liking of his sponsor. Merckx took the lead after stage five and never relinquished it; he dominated the lengthy stage nine time trial. Merckx went on to win the Tour de France and in doing so became the third rider to win two Grand Tours in a single calendar year. In 1971, reigning champion Merckx decided to ride the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré instead. Felice Gimondi lost substantial time early on in the race to put him out of contention, while fellow Italian and teammate Gianni Motta tested positive for banned substances and was dismissed from the Giro. Swedish cyclist Gösta Pettersson gained the lead after the race&#x27;s eighteenth stage and held it all the way to the finish. Pettersson became the first Swedish cyclist to win a Grand Tour.

Merckx returned to the Giro in 1972 and resumed his domination. He grabbed the lead after a long solo attack during the race&#x27;s seventh stage and never let go of the lead. Merckx led the 1973 Giro d&#x27;Italia from start to finish; a feat that had not been done since Alfredo Binda did in 1927.

Unfortunately in 1976 a rider died in an accident early in the race which stunned the riders, fans and race officials equally. By the third week it seemed as though Belgian rider Johan De Muynck was going to claim victory, but much to the delight of the Tifosi Gimondi rode a very strong final Individual Time Trial and won his third Giro by a very small margin in rather stunning fashion as he was getting older and not even considered a pre-race favorite. Belgians Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck won the two subsequent Giros in 1977 and 1978.

In 1980, Frenchman Bernard Hinault became France&#x27;s first winner since Anquetil in 1964. He would win another two Giros in 1982 and 1985.

The 1987 edition was highlighted by the controversy between &#x27;s two general classification riders Roberto Visentini and Stephen Roche. Roche led the race early on but lost the lead to Visentini after crashing during the thirteenth stage. Roche attacked on the race&#x27;s mountainous fifteenth stage despite orders from Carrera team management not to. Roche took the lead and wound up winning the Giro. Roche&#x27;s success would not stop there during the 1987 season, he would go on to win the Tour de France and the men&#x27;s road race at the World Championships to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling.

The 1988 Giro d&#x27;Italia is remembered for the fourteenth stage that contained very poor weather throughout the stage and most notably on the slopes of the Passo di Gavia. Franco Chioccioli led the race at the start of the fabled fourteenth stage. On the slopes of the Gavia, Andrew Hampsten and Erik Breukink rode away from their fellow riders; Breukink would go on to win the stage, but Hampsten would take the overall lead. Hampsten went on to win the race and became the first non-European to win the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

Spaniard Miguel Indurain, winner of five Tours, won successive Giros in 1991 and 1992.

===1997–2016===

Ivan Gotti&#x27;s wins in 1997 and 1999 were either side of the first win by Marco Pantani&#x27;s win in 1998. Pantani was considered a favorite to win the Giro d&#x27;Italia Other contenders included Gotti, Alex Zülle and 1996 winner Pavel Tonkov. Pantani lost time in the initial prologue in Nice and further time to his main rivals during the fifteenth stage, an individual time trial in Trieste. By that point, Pantani faced a disadvantage of almost four minutes to Zülle before the Dolomites mountain stages and an individual time trial on the penultimate stage, a discipline that favored Zülle and Tonkov. In the seventeenth stage to Selva di Val Gardena, Pantani took the maglia rosa, the leader&#x27;s jersey, for the first time in his career after attacking Zülle on the Marmolada climb. Although Pantani crossed the finish line behind Giuseppe Guerini, he finished over four minutes ahead of Zülle, maintaining an advantage of thirty seconds on the general classification over Tonkov, thirty-one seconds on Guerini and over a minute on Zülle. In the following stage to Alpe di Pampeago, he finished second behind Tonkov but maintained the general classification lead over him and gained further time on Zülle and Guerini. In the eighteenth stage to Plan di Montecampione, Pantani repeatedly attacked Tonkov, dropping him in the last three kilometers and winning the stage to face the individual time trial on the penultimate stage with a lead of almost a minute and a half. Zülle lost contact with the favorites in the first climb and ended up losing over thirty minutes. Having won over two minutes on Pantani in the previous time trial, Tonkov was considered superior to Pantani on the time trial discipline, but the Italian finished third in the penultimate stage, gaining an additional five seconds on Tonkov. Pantani was thus able to maintain his lead to win the Giro d&#x27;Italia with a minute and a half over Tonkov and more than six minutes over Guerini. He also won the Mountains classification and finished second in the Points classification.

Pantani subsequently went on to win the 1998 Tour de France, thus completing the rare feat of winning the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France in the same calendar year.

Pantani returned to the Giro in 1999 while in peak physical form. Pantani gained the lead after the race&#x27;s fourteenth stage and as the race hit the high mountains, he extended his lead with three stage wins. On the morning of the twentieth stage, Pantani was dismissed from the Giro after having hematocrit levels above 50%. 1997 victor Ivan Gotti, who was second place at the time, subsequently took the lead and wound up winning the Giro for the second time in his career.

Gilberto Simoni was the winner in 2001 and 2003, with Paolo Savoldelli victorious in 2002 and 2005. Other repeat winners this century have been Ivan Basso (2006 and 2010), Spaniard Alberto Contador in 2008 and 2015 and Vincenzo Nibali in 2013 and 2016. Contador also looked to have won the 2011 edition, a race during which Wouter Weylandt suffered a fatal crash on the third stage, but he was later stripped of the title after he was found guilty of doping in the 2010 Tour de France, and runner-up Michele Scarponi was awarded the victory.

The first South American winner was Nairo Quintana of Colombia in 2014.

===2017–present===
The 2017 Giro d&#x27;Italia was the 100th edition of the race. Tom Dumoulin won stage 10, a individual time trial (ITT) from Foligno to Montefalco, to take the overall race lead by 2 minutes and 23 seconds over Quintana. Dumoulin won Stage 14, which featured a mountain top finish at Santuario di Oropa to extend his lead over Quintana by a further 14 seconds. On Stage 16, Dumoulin experienced stomach problems and had to take a comfort break at the foot of the Umbrail Pass; none of the other contenders waited for Dumoulin and he finished more than two minutes down on stage winner Vincenzo Nibali, keeping his race lead by just 31 seconds over Quintana. Dumoulin defended his lead until the stage 19 mountain finish in Piancavallo, where he crossed the line over a minute behind Quintana, the new race leader. However, Dumoulin&#x27;s performance on stage 21, a individual time trial from Monza Circuit to Milan in which he finished second, took him from fourth to first place in the general classification. He was also the first Dutchman to win the overall in a Grand Tour since Joop Zoetemelk won the 1980 Tour de France.

In 2018 Simon Yates seemed to be in very good position to become the first British rider to win, winning 3 individual stages and holding the Maglia Rosa from Stage 6 onwards, with Dumoulin lying second overall for much of the race. However, on Stage 19, Yates cracked and Chris Froome then launched an audacious 80 km solo breakaway, attacking the small group of leaders including Dumoulin on the Cima Coppi of the 2018 Giro, the graveled climb of the Colle delle Finestre, he continued to extend his lead over the Sestriere and to the summit finish of Bardonecchia and overturned a more than three minute deficit to take both the pink jersey, the Cima Coppi prize and the mountains classification. The solo win, and the simultaneous implosion of Yates, who lost more than 30 minutes on the day having lost contact on the first climb of the day, was described as &quot;one of the most extraordinary days in Giro d&#x27;Italia history&quot;. Froome became the first British rider to ever win the Giro, as well as the first rider since 1983 to hold all three Grand Tour titles simultaneously, as well as becoming the seventh man to have completed the career Grand Tour grand slam.

In 2019 Richard Carapaz, from Ecuador, became the first rider from his country to win the race.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the postponement of the Giro to October, marking the only time in history that the Giro was not raced in May or June. This race was won by Tao Geoghegan Hart, making him the second British rider to win the race; then in the 2021 edition Egan Bernal became the second Colombian to ever win and in 2022 Jai Hindley became the first ever Australian to win.

The 2023 Giro d&#x27;Italia was won by Slovenian Primož Roglič, who took the lead from Geraint Thomas on the penultimate stage, a mountain time trial to Monte Lussari, near the Italian border with Slovenia. Even though he suffered a dropped chain on the climb, Roglič was able to gain 40 seconds on Thomas to move into the overall lead. He held onto it on the final, largely ceremonial stage into Rome to win the Giro d&#x27;Italia for the first time in his career.

In 2024, Tadej Pogačar, from Slovenia, won the race on his debut. He narrowly lost out on the lead after the first stage to Jhonatan Narváez, but took the pink jersey on the second stage and held it until the end. Pogačar executed a dominant victory, with a winning margin of almost 10 minutes, the mountains classification and 6 stage wins. The winning margin of 9:56 over his closest competitor, Daniel Martínez was the biggest since the 1965 edition and the fourth largest in the post-World War II era. Pogačar went on to win the 2024 Tour de France, becoming the first rider to win both the Giro and Tour in the same year since Marco Pantani in 1998.

==Classifications==
A few riders from each team aim to win overall but there are three further competitions to draw riders of all specialties: points, mountains, and a classification for young riders with general classification aspirations. The oldest of the four classifications is the general classification. The leader of each aforementioned classifications wears a distinctive jersey. If a rider leads more than one classification that awards, he wears the jersey of the most prestigious classification. The abandoned jersey is worn by the rider who is second in the competition.

===General classification===
The most sought after classification in the Giro d&#x27;Italia is the general classification. All of the stages are timed to the finish, and after finishing the riders&#x27; times are compounded with their previous stage times, so the rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race. The leader is determined after each stage&#x27;s conclusion. The leader of the race also has the privilege to wear the race leader&#x27;s pink jersey. The jersey is presented to the leader rider on a podium in the stage&#x27;s finishing town. If a rider is leading more than one classification that awards a jersey, he will wear the maglia rosa since the general classification is the most important one in the race. The lead can change after each stage.

The color pink was chosen as the magazine that created the Giro, &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, printed its newspapers on pink paper. The pink jersey was added to the race in the 1931 edition and it has since become a symbol of the Giro d&#x27;Italia. The first rider to wear the pink jersey was Learco Guerra. Riders usually try to make the extra effort to keep the jersey for as long as possible in order to get more publicity for the team and the sponsor(s) of the team. Eddy Merckx wore the jersey for 78 stages, more than any other rider in the history of the Giro d&#x27;Italia. Three riders have won the general classification five times in their career: Alfredo Binda, Fausto Coppi, and Eddy Merckx.

The general classification winner was not always determined by a time system. In the inaugural Giro d&#x27;Italia the organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. In addition to that, the organizers chose the point system since it would be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking the riders during each stage. The race leader was calculated by adding up each rider&#x27;s placings in each stage and the rider with the lowest total was the leader; if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage, he would have five points total. The system was modified a year later to give the riders who placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system the same for the riders who placed 1st through 50th in a stage. The calculation remained unmodified until 1912 where the organizers chose to have the race be centered around teams, while still keeping the point system. The next year race organizers chose to revert to the system used in 1911. In 1914, the organizers shifted to the system used nowadays, where riders would have their finishing times for each stage totaled together to determine the overall leader.

These are the time bonuses that the riders receive for crossing the lines in the first few positions:

===Mountains classification===

The mountains classification is the second oldest jersey awarding classification in the Giro d&#x27;Italia. The mountains classification was added to the Giro d&#x27;Italia in 1933 Giro d&#x27;Italia and was first won by Alfredo Binda. During mountain stages of the race, points are awarded to the rider who is first to reach the top of each significant climb. Points are also awarded for riders who closely follow the leader up each climb. The number of points awarded varies according to the hill classification, which is determined by the steepness and length of the course.

The climbers&#x27; jersey is worn by the rider who, at the start of each stage, has the largest number of climbing points. If a rider leads two or more of the categories, the climbers&#x27; jersey is worn by the rider in second, or third, place in that contest. At the end of the Giro, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification. In fact, some riders, particularly those who are neither sprinters nor particularly good at time-trialing, may attempt only to win this particular competition within the race. The Giro has four categories of mountains. They range from category 4, the easiest, to category 1, the hardest. There is also the &quot;Cima Coppi&quot;, the highest point reached in a particular Giro, which is worth more points than the race&#x27;s other first-category climbs. Gino Bartali has won the mountains classification a record seven times.

The classification awarded no jersey to the leader until the 1974 Giro d&#x27;Italia, when the organizers decided to award a green jersey to the leader. The green jersey was used until 2012, when the classification&#x27;s sponsor, Banca Mediolanum, renewed its sponsorship for another four years and desired the jersey to be blue rather than green.

The point distribution for the mountains is as follows:

===Points classification===

The points classification is the third oldest of the four jersey current awarding classifications in the Giro d&#x27;Italia. It was introduced in the 1966 Giro d&#x27;Italia and was first won by Gianni Motta. Points are given to the rider who is first to reach the end of, or determined places during, any stage of the Giro. The red jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the largest number of points. The rider who, at the end of the Giro, holds the most points, wins the points competition. Each stage win, regardless of the stage&#x27;s categorization, awards 25 points, second place is worth 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for fifteenth. This means that a true sprinter might not always win the points classification. The classification was added to draw the participation of the sprinters. The classification has been won four times by two riders: Francesco Moser and Giuseppe Saronni.

In addition, stages can have one or more intermediate sprints: 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s) are/is awarded to the first six cyclists passing these lines. These points also count toward the TV classification (&quot;Traguardo Volante&quot;, or &quot;flying sprint&quot;), a separate award.

The first year the points classification was used, it had no jersey that was given to the leader of the classification. In the 1967 Giro d&#x27;Italia, the red jersey was added for the leader of the classification. However, in 1969 the red jersey was changed to a cyclamen (purple) colored jersey. It remained that color until 2010 when the organizers chose to change the jersey back to the color red in a return to the original color scheme for the three minor classifications, which reflected the colors of the Italian flag. However, in April 2017 RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro, announced that the &quot;maglia ciclamino&quot; would be revived for the 2017 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

The point distribution for the sprints are as follows:

===Young rider classification===
The young rider classification is restricted to riders who are no older than 25 during that calendar year. The leader of the classification is determined the same way as the general classification, with the riders&#x27; times being added up after each stage and the eligible rider with lowest aggregate time is dubbed the leader. This classification was added to the Giro d&#x27;Italia in the 1976 edition, with Alfio Vandi being the first to win the classification after placing seventh overall. The classification was not contested between the years of 1995 and 2006. The classification was reintroduced in the 2007, and has been in each Giro since. The Giro d&#x27;Italia awards a white jersey to the leader of the classification. Evgeni Berzin, Nairo Quintana and Tao Geoghegan Hart won the young rider classification and the general classification in the same year : in 1994, 2014 and 2020. Four riders have won the young rider classification twice in their respective careers: Vladimir Poulnikov, Pavel Tonkov, Bob Jungels and Miguel Ángel López.

===Team classifications===

There are two team classifications that are contested at the Giro d&#x27;Italia: the &quot;Trofeo Fast Team&quot; and the &quot;Trofeo Super Team&quot;. The &quot;Trofeo Fast Team&quot; is the older of the two as it was introduced in the first Giro d&#x27;Italia. It was first won by Atala. The &quot;Trofeo Fast Team&quot; is determined by adding the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. The classification was simply called the team classification in each edition until the organizers changed it to the &quot;Trofeo Fast Team&quot; for the 1994 Giro d&#x27;Italia. won the &quot;Trofeo Fast Team&quot; classification in 2018.

The &quot;Trofeo Super Team&quot; was introduced at the 1993 Giro d&#x27;Italia. The name &quot;Trofeo Super Team&quot; was adopted for the 1994 edition of the Giro and been used ever since. The classification was first won by Ariostea in 1993. The classification is a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team. The Trofeo Super Team classification was discontinued in 2017, when it was won by .

===Minor classifications===

Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, are awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the &quot;Traguardo Volante&quot;, or TV. The TV gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the TV classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously time-based. In 2013 this classification was renamed to the sprints classification and was won by Rafael Andriato.

Other awards include the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. It was won by Mark Cavendish in 2013. The Azzurri d&#x27;Italia classification is based on finishing order; however, points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was also most recently won by Mark Cavendish. Additionally, the &quot;Trofeo Fuga Pinarello&quot; rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. &#x27;s Rafael Andriato was first in this competition in 2013. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. Several teams tied for the Fair Play classification in 2018 (and also in 2021), not receiving any points (the team&#x27;s best placed rider in the General Classification then serves as a tie-breaker).

===Defunct classifications===

In 1946 the maglia nera (black jersey) was introduced and awarded the cyclist who was last in the general classification. Riders sometimes deliberately wasted time in order to become last overall and so wear the black jersey. The classification was short lived, as it was last contested in the 1951 Giro d&#x27;Italia. The classification was won twice by Luigi Malabrocca, who won the classification in 1946 and 1947. The last winner of the maglia nera was Giovanni Pinarello.

The intergiro classification was introduced in 1989 and first won by Yugoslavian Jure Pavlič. In each stage there would be a point, before the finish, where the riders would be timed until they crossed the line. The times from each stage would then be added together for each rider to determine the leader of the classification. The leader of the classification was awarded a blue jersey. The classification was run each year since its addition until 2005. The last winner of the classification was Stefano Zanini. Fabrizio Guidi won the classification three times, the most by any rider. Guidi won the classification in 1996, 1999, and 2000.

There was also a combination classification that was introduced in the 1985 Giro d&#x27;Italia and was first won by Urs Freuler. The classification was discontinued after the 1988 Giro d&#x27;Italia. For the 1988 edition of the Giro, the classification awarded a blue jersey. However, the classification was reintroduced for the 2006 Giro d&#x27;Italia and was won by Paolo Savoldelli. The classification was not brought back in the 2007 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

==The race==
The Giro d&#x27;Italia contains either 21 or 20 stages and a prologue (an individual time trial under in length) and two or three rest days. There are three types of stages that are used in the Giro d&#x27;Italia: the mass-start stages, individual time trials, and team time trials. The mass-start stages make up most of the 21 racing days of each year&#x27;s Giro d&#x27;Italia, there are usually two time trials in each edition of the Giro d&#x27;Italia, and sometimes three if there is a prologue or team time trial. In mass start stages there are time bonuses of ten, six and four seconds for the first three finishers, and, in some years, bonuses of three, two and one seconds at intermediate sprints. 

Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini holds the record of 42 stage victories.
The Giro d&#x27;Italia is known for its steep and difficult climbs. Each race features a few stages that contain many climbs of high severity. The race traditionally passes through the Alps with some of the longest climbs in the Dolomites. The first Alpine pass included was the Sestriere in 1911. The Dolomites were first included in the Giro in 1937, when the race crossed over the Rolle Pass and the Passo di Costalunga. Some of the most famous mountains used in the Giro are the Passo dello Stelvio, Passo Pordoi, and the Passo di Gavia. Since 1965 the highest point in the Giro d&#x27;Italia has been dubbed the &quot;Cima Coppi&quot; in honor of the great Italian climber Fausto Coppi.

The first Giro time trial was over between Bologna and Ferrara in 1933 and was won by Alfredo Binda. A time trial is sometimes used as the penultimate or final stage, and some editions have featured a mountain time trial stage. The first stage in modern Giros is often a short trial, a &quot;prologue&quot;, to decide who wears pink on the opening day. The first prologue occurred in the 1968 Giro d&#x27;Italia. The route stretched around the streets of Campione d&#x27;Italia and was won by the Frenchman Charly Grosskost. The riders raced the course in an unusual format, with the riders racing in ten groups of thirteen and the time not being counted towards their overall time.

The first team time trial occurred in the 1937 Giro d&#x27;Italia and was won by the Italian team, Legnano. The course was in length and stretched from Viareggio to Marina di Massa.

The Giro takes place mainly in Italy, but some stages have departure or conclusion locations in, or pass through, the neighboring countries of San Marino, France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and Vatican City State. The other countries visited, usually in connection with the opening stages of the race, are Belgium, Luxembourg, Croatia, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, Greece, Israel, Netherlands, Monaco and the United Kingdom.
==The start and finish of the Giro==
For nearly half a century, the Giro started and finished by Milan, the city where the headquarters of the &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; is located. In 1911 these events took place in Rome to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Italy&#x27;s unification. With the occasional exception, the start and finish in Milan were the standard for the Giro d&#x27;Italia. However, since the 1960s the place of departure has changed each year and finishes in cities such as Verona, Brescia, Trieste, Turin and Rome have become more frequent.

The start of the Giro d&#x27;Italia (&quot;La Grande Partenza&quot;) is a significant occasion and cities invest heavily, hoping to recoup the cost in tourism, exposure and other benefits: Denmark spent an estimated $3.86 million to host the opening stages of the 2012 edition.
===Starts outside Italy===

For the first 47 editions of the race, the race started on Italian soil. In 1965 the race made its first foreign start in San Marino, and has since had twelve more foreign starts. The 2018 start in Jerusalem was met with controversy as activists called for the race to be moved, claiming that the race whitewashes Israel&#x27;s human rights record. Ultimately, the race went ahead as scheduled and every team selected for the Giro took part, including two teams of Arabic ownership: the Bahrain-Mérida team and the United Arab Emirates team. The intended start of the 2020 race in Hungary was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Media coverage==
The Giro is broadcast throughout Europe, and also available in other areas throughout the globe:
* Europe — Eurosport

<doc id="246780" wikidata="Q219014" url="?curid=246780" title="Fourteen Holy Helpers">
<text>The Fourteen Holy Helpers (, ) are a group of saints venerated together by Catholics because their intercession is believed to be particularly effective, especially against various diseases. This group of &quot;Nothelfer&quot; (&quot;helpers in need&quot;) originated in the 14th century at first in the Rhineland, largely as a result of the epidemic (probably of bubonic plague) that became known as the Black Death.

==History of veneration==
Devotion to the fourteen Holy Helpers began in Rhineland, now part of Germany, in the time of the Black Death. Among the fourteen were three virgin martyrs. A German mnemonic for them says:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Margaretha mit dem Wurm,&quot;
&quot;Barbara mit dem Turm,&quot;
&quot;Katharina mit dem Radl&quot;
&quot;das sind die drei heiligen Madl.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
(&quot;Margaret with the lindworm,
Barbara with the tower,
Catherine with the wheel,
those are the three holy maids.&quot;)
&lt;/poem&gt;
As the other saints began to be invoked along with these three virgin martyrs, they were represented together in works of art. Popular veneration of these saints often began in a monastery that held their relics. All of the saints except Giles were accounted martyrs.

Saint Christopher and Saint Giles were invoked against the plague itself. Saint Denis was prayed to for relief from headache, Saint Blaise against ills of the throat, Saint Elmo, against abdominal maladies, Saint Barbara against fever, and Saint Vitus against epilepsy. Saint Pantaleon was the patron of physicians, Saint Cyriacus invoked against temptation on the deathbed, and Saints Christopher, Barbara, and Catherine of Alexandria for protection against a sudden and unprovided-for death. Saint Giles was prayed to for a good confession, and Saint Eustace as healer of family troubles. Domestic animals were also attacked by the plague, and so Saints George, Elmo, Pantaleon, and Vitus were invoked for their protection. Saint Margaret of Antioch is the patron of safe childbirth.

As the saints&#x27; joint &quot;cultus&quot; spread in the fifteenth century, Pope Nicholas V attached indulgences to devotion of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, though these no longer apply. While each had a separate feast day, the Fourteen Holy Helpers were in some places celebrated as a group on 8 August, but this celebration never became part of the General Roman Calendar for universal veneration. When that calendar was revised in 1969, the individual celebrations of St Barbara, St Catherine of Alexandria, St Christopher, and St Margaret of Antioch were dropped, but in 2004 Pope John Paul II reinstated the 25 November optional memorial of Catherine of Alexandria, whose voice was heard by Saint Joan of Arc. The individual celebrations of all fourteen are included in the General Roman Calendar as in 1954, the General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII and the General Roman Calendar of 1960.

Comparable to the devotion of the Fourteen Holy Helpers was that of the Four Holy Marshals, who were also venerated in the Rhineland as &quot;Marshals of God&quot;. These were Quirinus of Neuss, Saint Anthony the Great, Pope Cornelius, and Saint Hubert.

==The Auxiliary Saints==
The fourteen saints are:

Half the saints are regarded as historical figures (Blaise, Cyriacus, Erasmus, George, Giles, Pantaleon, Vitus) while the other may be only legends (Agathius, Barbara, Catherine of Alexandria, Christopher, Denis, Eustace, Margaret of Antioch). In the case of the latter group, their supposed &quot;legendary&quot; status is primarily based on analysis of the saints&#x27; traditional hagiographies alone with out due consideration of other possibilities and interpretations, as well as the changes associated with the &quot;Mysterii Paschalis&quot;, irrespective of which changes actually applied to these particular saints — in the instance of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, while the feasts were in several cases removed from the General Roman Calendar, none were decanonized or were denied as having existed to begin with (furthermore, their feasts remain on particular calendars).

For one or another of the saints in the original set, Anthony the Anchorite, Leonard of Noblac, Nicholas, Sebastian, Oswald the King, Pope Sixtus II, Apollonia, Dorothea of Caesarea, Wolfgang of Regensburg or Roch were sometimes substituted. In France an extra &quot;helper&quot; is added: the Virgin Mary.

==The Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen==


The Fourteen Holy Helpers are honored in Bavaria as the &quot;vierzehn Heiligen&quot;, and the Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen is dedicated to these auxiliary saints. The Rococo pilgrimage church near the town of Bad Staffelstein was designed by Balthasar Neumann and built between 1743 and 1772.

Devotion to these saints began in that region on 24 September 1445 when Hermann Leicht, the young shepherd of a nearby Franciscan monastery, saw a crying child in a field belonging to the nearby Cistercian monastery of Langheim. As he bent down to pick up the child, it abruptly disappeared. A short time later, the child reappeared in the same spot. This time, two candles were burning next to it. In June 1446, Leicht saw the child a third time. This time, the child bore a red cross on its chest and was accompanied by thirteen other children. The child said: &quot;We are the fourteen helpers and wish to erect a chapel here, where we can rest. If you will be our servant, we will be yours!&quot; Shortly after, Leicht saw two burning candles descending to this spot. It is alleged that miraculous healings soon began, through the intervention of the fourteen saints.

The Cistercian brothers to whom the land belonged erected a chapel, which immediately attracted pilgrims. An altar was consecrated as early as 1448. Pilgrimages to the Vierzehnheiligen continue to the present day between May and October.

==Depiction in culture==
One of the group depictions of the fourteen Saints is a 1503 altarpiece by Matthias Grünewald for the monastery in Lichtenfels in Upper Franconia.

The fourteen angels of the lost children&#x27;s prayer in Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s fairy opera, &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, symbolize the Fourteen Holy Helpers. The English words are familiar:

<text>Hopalong Casualty is a 1960 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical animated short, directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on October 8, 1960, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. The title is a play on the Hopalong Cassidy western series of books written by author Clarence E. Mulford.

==Plot==
As usual, Wile E. Coyote (Hard-headipus ravenus) has gone in pursuit of The Road Runner (Speedipus Rex). The title shows just before the Coyote gains on the Road Runner. He lunges, leaping and grabbing his quarry by the throat. A two-second wrestling match follows, with both combatants in a round ball rolling down the road from the force of their running, but Wile E. emerges &quot;holding&quot; only a smoke outline of the bird. The confused coyote looks in his hands just as the Road Runner speeds up behind Wile E. He beeps, sending the Coyote flying through the air and leaves him hanging on a telephone pole. When he slides back down, the Road Runner beeps again, sending not only Wile E. in the air, but also the telephone pole, which escapes Wile E.&#x27;s grip. He then looks relieved, but because of the power lines, the pole zooms back to Wile E. and drives him into the ground. He then comes out of a nearby manhole, flattened and humiliated. Of course, there is nothing left to do but plan more schemes.

1. First, the Coyote goes simple by waiting behind a rock face, and when he hears the &quot;beep-beep&quot; of the Road Runner, he jumps out into the middle of the road, only to be flattened by an approaching truck.

2. Next, the Coyote sets up a rope and rock trap, but when he pulls the string, he ends up squashing himself (but not his feet).

3. The Coyote now places dynamite in a tunnel under the road, but as he goes deeper into the tunnel, the detonator handle pushes down further, and eventually the dynamite explodes on the Coyote.

3. Now, the Coyote uses an Acme Christmas Packaging Machine. He puts it in a pit with a sign that says &quot;DETOUR&quot;. The Coyote snickers gleefully, but then the Road Runner, as expected, pops up behind the coyote and beeps. The startled Coyote leaps in the air and into the Christmas Packaging Machine. The result is a neatly packaged Wile E. Coyote. Humiliated, the boxed Coyote tiptoes off the screen.

4. This time, the Coyote uses dynamite on a fishing line. When he hears the Road Runner, he jerks back the rod and prepares to cast the line. He jerks a bit too hard, however; the dynamite gets stuck in a cactus, and eventually, the Coyote gets wound around the cactus with the line. He then sees that the dynamite is about to go off, and tries to blow out the fuse, but instead makes it burn down faster, and it then explodes.

5. Finally, the Coyote scatters some Acme Earthquake Pills on the road, hoping that the Road Runner can mistake them for birdseed. The Road Runner obligingly eats them, but they have no effect as he zooms away. In disgust, the Coyote swallows an earthquake pill himself, and then even more disgustedly swallows all of the remaining pills. After jumping up and down several times in an attempt to trigger an earthquake, he contemptuously chucks the empty bottle over his shoulder, but immediately leaps after the bottle with bulging eyes to catch it before it shatters in the middle of the road. Wile E. is just in time to read the fine print at the bottom of the bottle&#x27;s label: &quot;Caution: Not effective on Road Runners&quot;. As soon as he sees this, he gulps nervously, now knowing what he faces. As he gingerly takes his first step to get out of the middle of the road, the product takes effect on him, causing him to shake, rattle and jerk helplessly across the landscape, getting flattened by a huge boulder and almost falling off a narrow rocky arch in the process. When the product finally wears off, the Coyote feels so relieved that he steps out without looking where he&#x27;s going, and walks over a cliff&#x27;s edge, falling to the ground. The Road Runner then beeps once more and takes off, with the trail of smoke left behind him, forming the words &quot;The End&quot;.

<text>Audio power is the electrical power transferred from an audio amplifier to a loudspeaker, measured in watts. The electrical power delivered to the loudspeaker, together with its efficiency, determines the sound power generated (with the rest of the electrical power being converted to heat).

Amplifiers are limited in the electrical energy they can output, while loudspeakers are limited in the electrical energy they can convert to sound energy without being damaged or distorting the audio signal. These limits, or power ratings, are important to consumers finding compatible products and comparing competitors.

==Power handling==
In audio electronics, there are several methods of measuring power output (for such things as amplifiers) and power handling capacity (for such things as loudspeakers).

=== Amplifiers ===
Amplifier output power is limited by voltage, current, and temperature:
* Voltage: The amp&#x27;s power supply voltage limits the maximum amplitude of the waveform it can output. This determines the peak momentary output power for a given load resistance.
* Current: The amp&#x27;s output devices (transistors or tubes) have a current limit, above which they are damaged. This determines the minimum load resistance that the amp can drive at its maximum voltage.
* Temperature: The amp&#x27;s output devices waste some of the electrical energy as heat, and if it is not removed quickly enough, they will rise in temperature to the point of damage. This determines the continuous output power.
As an amplifier&#x27;s power output strongly influences its price, there is an incentive for manufacturers to exaggerate output power specs to increase sales. Without regulations, imaginative approaches to advertising power ratings became so common that in 1975 the US Federal Trade Commission intervened in the market and required all amplifier manufacturers to use an engineering measurement (continuous average power) in addition to any other value they might cite.

=== Loudspeakers ===
For loudspeakers, there is also a thermal and a mechanical aspect to maximum power handling.
* Thermal: Not all energy delivered to a loudspeaker is emitted as sound. In fact, most is converted to heat, and the temperature must not rise too high. High level signals over a prolonged period can cause thermal damage, which may be immediately obvious, or reduce longevity or performance margin. 
* Mechanical: Loudspeaker components have mechanical limits which can be exceeded by even a very brief power peak; an example is the most common sort of loudspeaker driver, which cannot move in or out more than some excursion limit without mechanical damage.
There are no similar loudspeaker power handling regulations in the US; the problem is much harder as many loudspeaker systems have very different power handling capacities at different frequencies (e.g., tweeters which handle high frequency signals are physically small and easily damaged, while woofers which handle low frequency signals are larger and more robust).

== Power calculations ==
Since the instantaneous power of an AC waveform varies over time, AC power, which includes audio power, is measured as an average over time. It is based on this formula:
:formula_1

For a purely resistive load, a simpler equation can be used, based on the root mean square (RMS) values of the voltage and current waveforms:
:formula_2

In the case of a steady sinusoidal tone (not music) into a purely resistive load, this can be calculated from the peak amplitude of the voltage waveform (which is easier to measure with an oscilloscope) and the load&#x27;s resistance:
:formula_3

Though a speaker is &quot;not&quot; purely resistive, these equations are often used to approximate power measurements for such a system. Approximations may be used as reference on a specification sheet of a product.

=== Example ===
An amplifier under test can drive a sinusoidal signal with a peak amplitude of 6 V (driven by a 12 V battery). When connected to an 8 ohm loudspeaker this would deliver:
:formula_4

In most actual car systems, the amplifiers are connected in a bridge-tied load configuration, and speaker impedances are no higher than 4 Ω. High-power car amplifiers use a DC-to-DC converter to generate a higher supply voltage.

== Measurements ==

=== Continuous power and &quot;RMS power&quot; ===
&quot;Continuous&quot; &quot;average sine wave power&quot; ratings are a staple of performance specifications for audio amplifiers and, sometimes, loudspeakers.

As described above, the term &quot;average power&quot; refers to the average value of the instantaneous power waveform over time. As this is typically derived from the root mean square (RMS) of the sine wave voltage, it is often referred to as &quot;RMS power&quot; or &quot;watts RMS&quot;, but this is incorrect: it is &quot;not&quot; the RMS value of the power waveform (which would be a larger, but meaningless, number). The erroneous term &quot;watts RMS&quot; is actually used in an ANSI standard. This is also referred to as the nominal value, there being a product mark requirement to use it.

&quot;Continuous&quot; (as opposed to &quot;momentary&quot;) implies that the device can function at this power level for long periods of time; that heat can be removed at the same rate it is generated, without temperature building up to the point of damage.

On May 3, 1974, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) instated its Amplifier Rule to combat the unrealistic power claims made by many hi-fi amplifier manufacturers. This rule prescribes continuous power measurements performed with sine wave signals for advertising and specifications of amplifiers sold in the US. (See more in the section Standards at the end of this article). This rule was amended in 1998 to cover self-powered speakers such as are commonly used with personal computers (see examples below).

Typically, an amplifier&#x27;s power specifications are calculated by measuring its RMS output voltage, with a continuous sine wave signal, at the onset of clipping—defined arbitrarily as a stated percentage of total harmonic distortion (THD), usually 1%, into specified load resistances. Typical loads used are 8 and 4 ohms per channel; many amplifiers used in professional audio are also specified at 2 ohms. Considerably more power can be delivered if distortion is allowed to increase; some manufacturers quote maximum power at a higher distortion, like 10%, making their equipment appear more powerful than if measured at an acceptable distortion level.

Continuous power measurements do not actually describe the highly varied signals found in audio equipment (which could vary from high crest factor instrument recordings down to 0 dB crest factor square waves) but are widely regarded as a reasonable way of describing an amplifier&#x27;s maximum output capability. For audio equipment, this is nearly always the nominal frequency range of human hearing, 20 Hz to 20 kHz.

In loudspeakers, thermal capacities of the voice coils and magnet structures largely determine continuous power handling ratings. However, at the lower end of a loudspeaker&#x27;s usable frequency range, its power handling might necessarily be derated because of mechanical excursion limits. For example, a subwoofer rated at 100 watts may be able to handle 100 watts of power at 80 hertz, but at 25 hertz it might not be able to handle nearly as much power since such frequencies would, for some drivers in some enclosures, force the driver beyond its mechanical limits much before reaching 100 watts from the amplifier.

===Peak power===
&quot;Peak power&quot; refers to the maximum of the instantaneous power waveform, which, for a sine wave, is always twice the average power. For other waveforms, the relationship between peak power and average power is the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

The peak power of an amplifier is determined by the voltage rails and the maximum amount of current its electronic components can handle for an instant without damage. This characterizes the ability of equipment to handle quickly changing power levels, as many audio signals have a highly dynamic nature.

It always produces a higher value than the average power figure, however, and so has been tempting to use in advertising without context, making it look as though the amp has twice the power of competitors.

===Total system power===
Total system power is a term often used in audio electronics to rate the power of an audio system. Total system power refers to the total power consumption of the unit, rather than the power handling of the speakers or the power output of the amplifier. This can be viewed as a somewhat deceptive marketing ploy, as the total power consumption of the unit will of course be greater than any of its other power ratings, except for, perhaps, the peak power of the amplifier, which is essentially an exaggerated value anyway. Shelf stereos and surround sound receivers are often rated using total system power.

One way to use total system power to get a more accurate estimate of power is to consider the amplifier class which would give an educated guess of the power output by considering the efficiency of the class. For example, class AB amplifiers can vary widely from 25% to 75% efficiency while Class D amps are much higher at 80% to 95%. An exceptionally efficient Class D amp, the ROHM BD5421efs, operates at 90% efficiency.

In some cases, an audio device may be measured by the &quot;total system power&quot; of all its loudspeakers by adding all their peak power ratings. Many home theater in a box systems are rated this way. Often low-end home theater systems&#x27; power ratings are taken at a high level of harmonic distortion as well; as high as 10%, which would be noticeable.

=== PMPO ===
&quot;PMPO&quot;, which stands for &quot;Peak Music Power Output&quot; or &quot;Peak momentary performance output&quot;, is a much more dubious figure of merit, of interest more to advertising copy-writers than to consumers. The term PMPO has never been defined in any standard, but it is often taken to be the sum of some sort of peak power for each amplifier in a system. Different manufacturers use different definitions, so that the ratio of PMPO to continuous power output varies widely; it is not possible to convert from one to the other. Most amplifiers can sustain their PMPO for only a very short time, if at all; loudspeakers are not designed to withstand their stated PMPO for anything but a momentary peak without serious damage.

== Power and loudness in the real world ==

Perceived &quot;loudness&quot; varies approximately logarithmically with the acoustical output power. The change in perceived loudness as a function of change in acoustical power is dependent on the reference power level. It is both useful and technically accurate to express perceived loudness in the logarithmic decibel (dB) scale that is independent of the reference power, with a somewhat straight-line relationship between 10 dB changes and doublings of perceived loudness.

The approximately logarithmic relationship between power and perceived loudness is an important factor in audio system design. Both amplifier power and speaker sensitivity affect the maximum realizable loudness. Sensitivity is typically measured either suspended in an anechoic chamber in &#x27;free space&#x27; (for full range speakers), or with the source and receiver outside on the ground in &#x27;half space&#x27; (for a subwoofer).

While a doubling/halving of perceived loudness corresponds to approximately 10 dB increase/decrease in speaker sensitivity, it also corresponds to approximately 10X multiplication/division of acoustical power. Even a relatively modest 3 dB increase/decrease in sensitivity corresponds to a doubling/halving of acoustical power. When measuring in &#x27;half space&#x27;, the boundary of the ground plane cuts the available space that the sound radiates into in half and doubles the acoustical power at the receiver, for a corresponding 3 dB increase in measured sensitivity, so it is important to know the test conditions. ±3 dB change in measured sensitivity also corresponds to a similar doubling/halving of electrical power required to generate a given perceived loudness, so even deceptively &#x27;minor&#x27; differences in sensitivity can result in large changes in amplifier power requirement. This is important because power amplifiers become increasingly impractical with increasing amplifier power output.

Many high-quality domestic speakers have a sensitivity between ~84 dB and ~94 dB, but professional speakers can have a sensitivity between ~90 dB and ~100 dB. An &#x27;84 dB&#x27; source would require a 400-watt amplifier to produce the same acoustical power (perceived loudness) as a &#x27;90 dB&#x27; source being driven by a 100-watt amplifier, or a &#x27;100 dB&#x27; source being driven by a 10 watt amplifier. A good measure of the &#x27;power&#x27; of a system is therefore a plot of maximum loudness before clipping of the amplifier and loudspeaker combined, in dB SPL, at the listening position intended, over the audible frequency spectrum. The human ear is less sensitive to low frequencies, as indicated by equal-loudness contours, so a well-designed system should be capable of generating relatively higher sound levels below 100 Hz before clipping.

Like perceived loudness, speaker sensitivity also varies with frequency and power. The sensitivity is measured at 1 watt to minimize nonlinear effects such as power compression and harmonic distortion, and averaged over the usable bandwidth. The bandwidth is often specified between the measured &#x27;+/-3 dB&#x27; cutoff frequencies where the relative loudness becomes attenuated from the peak loudness by at least 6 dB. Some speaker manufacturers use &#x27;+3 dB/-6 dB&#x27; instead, to take into account the real-world in-room response of a speaker at frequency extremes where the floor/wall/ceiling boundaries may increase the perceived loudness.

Speaker sensitivity is measured and rated on the assumption of a fixed amplifier output voltage because audio amplifiers tend to behave like voltage sources. Sensitivity can be a misleading metric due to differences in speaker impedance between differently designed speakers. A speaker with a higher impedance may have lower measured sensitivity and thus appear to be less efficient than a speaker with a lower impedance even though their efficiencies are actually similar. Speaker efficiency is a metric that only measures the actual percentage of electrical power that the speaker converts to acoustic power and is sometimes a more appropriate metric to use when investigating ways to achieve a given acoustic power from a speaker.

Adding an identical and mutually coupled speaker driver (much less than a wavelength away from each other) and splitting the electrical power equally between the two drivers increases their combined efficiency by a maximum of 3 dB, similar to increasing the size of a single driver until the diaphragm area doubles. Multiple drivers can be more practical to increase efficiency than larger drivers since frequency response is generally proportional to driver size.

System designers take advantage of this efficiency boost by using mutually coupled drivers in a speaker cabinet, and by using mutually coupled speaker cabinets in a venue. Each doubling of total driver area in the array of drivers brings ~3 dB increase in efficiency until the limit where the total distance between any two drivers of the array exceeds ~1/4 wavelength.

Power handling capability is also doubled when the number of drivers doubles, for a maximum realizable increase of ~6 dB in total acoustic output per doubling of mutually coupled drivers when the total amplifier power is also doubled. Mutual coupling efficiency gains become difficult to realize with multiple drivers at higher frequencies because the total size of a single driver including its diaphragm, basket, waveguide or horn may already exceed one wavelength.

Sources that are much smaller than a wavelength behave like point sources that radiate omnidirectionally in free space, whereas sources larger than a wavelength act as their own &#x27;ground plane&#x27; and beam the sound forward. This beaming tends to make high frequency dispersion problematic in larger venues, so a designer may have to cover the listening area with multiple sources aimed in various directions or placed in various locations.

Likewise, speaker proximity much less than 1/4 wavelength to one or more boundaries such as floor/walls/ceiling can increase the effective sensitivity by changing free space into half space, quarter space, or eighth space. When the distance to boundaries is &gt; 1/4 wavelength, delayed reflections can increase the perceived loudness but can also induce ambient effects such as comb filtering and reverberation that can make the frequency response uneven across a venue or make the sound diffuse and harsh, especially with smaller venues and hard reflective surfaces.

Sound absorbing structures, sound diffusing structures, and digital signal processing may be employed to compensate for boundary effects within the designated listening area.

==Matching amplifier to loudspeaker==
Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; McGregor, while serving as senior technologist for Eastern Acoustic Works, wrote a guideline for professional audio purchasers wishing to select properly sized amplifiers for their loudspeakers. Chuck McGregor recommended a rule of thumb in which the amplifier&#x27;s maximum power output rating was twice the loudspeaker&#x27;s continuous (so-called &quot;RMS&quot;) rating, give or take 20%. In his example, a loudspeaker with a continuous power rating of 250 watts would be well-matched by an amplifier with a maximum power output within the range of 400 to 625 watts.

JBL, which tests and labels their loudspeakers according to the IEC 268-5 standard (called IEC 60268-5 more recently) has a more nuanced set of recommendations, depending on the usage profile of the system, which more fundamentally involves the (worst case) crest factor of the signal used to drive the loudspeakers:
# For &quot;carefully monitored applications where peak transient capability must be maintained, a system should be powered with an amplifier capable of delivering twice its IEC rating.&quot; As an example, a studio monitor rated at 300 watts IEC, can be safely driven by a 600-watt (RMS) amplifier, provided that &quot;peak signals are normally of such short duration that they hardly stress the system&#x27;s components&quot;.
# For &quot;routine application where high continuous, but non-distorted, output is likely to be encountered, a system should be powered with an amplifier capable of delivering the IEC rating of the system&quot;. This includes most consumer systems. &quot;Such systems can often be inadvertently overdriven, or can go into feedback. When powered with an amplifier equal to their IEC rating, the user is guaranteed of safe operation.&quot;
# &quot;For musical instrument application, where distorted (overdriven) output may be a musical requirement, the system should be powered with an amplifier capable of delivering only one-half of the IEC rating for the system.&quot; This necessary because, for example, an amplifier normally outputting &quot;300 watts of undistorted sinewave&quot; can reach closer to 600 watts of power when clipping (i.e. when its output is closer to a square wave). If such a scenario is plausible, then for safe operation of the loudspeaker, the amplifier&#x27;s (RMS) rating must no more than half the IEC power of the loudspeaker.

== Power handling in &#x27;active&#x27; speakers ==

Active speakers comprise two or three speakers per channel, each fitted with its own amplifier, and preceded by an electronic crossover filter to separate the low-level audio signal into the frequency bands to be handled by each speaker. This approach enables complex active filters to be used on the low level signal, without the need to use passive crossovers of high power handling capability but limited rolloff and with large and expensive inductors and capacitors. An additional advantage is that peak power handling is greater if the signal has simultaneous peaks in two different frequency bands. A single amplifier has to handle the peak power when both signal voltages are at their crest; as power is proportional to the square of voltage, the peak power when both signals are at the same peak voltage is proportional to the square of the sum of the voltages. If separate amplifiers are used, each must handle the square of the peak voltage in its own band. For example, if bass and midrange each has a signal corresponding to 10 W of output, a single amplifier capable of handling a 40 W peak would be needed, but a bass and a treble amplifier each capable of handling 10 W would be sufficient. This is relevant when peaks of comparable amplitude occur in different frequency bands, as with wideband percussion and high-amplitude bass notes.

For most audio applications more power is needed at low frequencies. This requires a high-power amplifier for low frequencies (e.g., 200 watts for 20–200 Hz band), lower power amplifier for the midrange (e.g., 50 watts for 200 to 1000 Hz), and even less the high end (e.g. 5 watts for 1000–20000 Hz). Proper design of a bi/tri amplifier system requires a study of driver (speaker) frequency response and sensitivities to determine optimal crossover frequencies and power amplifier powers.

== Regional Variations ==

===United States===
Peak momentary power output and peak music power output are two different measurements with different specifications and should not be used interchangeably. Manufacturers who use different words such as pulse or performance may be reflecting their own non-standard system of measurement, with an unknown meaning. The Federal Trade Commission is putting an end to this with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Rule 46 CFR 432 (1974), affecting Power Output Claims for Amplifiers Utilized in Home Entertainment Products.

In response to a Federal Trade Commission order, the Consumer Electronics Association has established a clear and concise measure of audio power for consumer electronics. They have posted an FTC approved product marking template on their web site and the full standard is available for a fee.
Many believe this will resolve much of the ambiguity and confusion in amplifier ratings.
There will be ratings for speaker and powered speaker system too. This specification only applies to audio amplifiers. An EU counterpart is expected and all equipment sold in the US and Europe will be identically tested and rated.

This regulation did not cover automobile entertainment systems, which consequently still suffer from power ratings confusion. However, a new Approved American National Standard ANSI/CEA-2006-B which includes testing &amp; measurement methods for mobile audio amplifiers is being slowly phased into the market by many manufacturers.

===Europe===

DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung, German Institute for Standardization) describes in DIN 45xxx several standards for measuring audio power. The DIN-standards (DIN-norms) are in common use in Europe.

===International===

IEC 60268-2 defines power amplifier specifications including power output.

<doc id="246804" wikidata="Q6564797" url="?curid=246804" title="List of British divisions in World War II">
<text>During the Second World War, the basic tactical formation used by the majority of combatants was the division. It was a self-contained formation that possessed all the required forces for combat, which was supplemented by its own artillery, engineers, communications and supply units. On 3 September 1939, at the start of the war, the United Kingdom had 2 armoured, 24 infantry and 7 anti-aircraft divisions. The anti-aircraft divisions were not comparable in role to formations that were intended for combat such as infantry divisions. In September, the British Army stated that 55 divisions (a mix of armoured, infantry and cavalry) would be raised to combat Germany. The UK would provide 32 of these formations and the remainder would be raised by the Dominions and India.

In 1941, this goal was adjusted to 57 divisions, with the UK to provide 36. By the end of 1941, the UK had met its quota. Over the course of the war, 85 divisional formations were raised although they did not all exist simultaneously and not all of them were combat formations. For example, the 12th Division (SDF) was raised to protect the lines of communication behind fighting formations. Several divisions were created when a division of one type was converted into another, for example the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division was converted into the 42nd Armoured Division. Others, such as the 79th Armoured Division, were not intended to act as a fighting formation. Instead, it acted in an administrative capacity for dispersed units that were engaged in combat. The 85 divisional formations included 2 airborne, 12 anti-aircraft, 11 armoured, 1 cavalry, 10 coastal defence (known as County Divisions) and 49 infantry divisions. At the end of the war, in 1945, the British Army had 24 divisions.

==Background==

During the interwar period, the British Army was split into two branches: the regular army, which numbered 224,000 men with a reserve of 173,700 at the start of the war, and the part-time Territorial Army that numbered 438,100 with a reserve of around 20,750 men. The main goal of the regular army, largely built around battalion-sized formations, was to police and garrison the British Empire. The basic tactical formation among the major militaries was the division. These were self-contained formations that possessed all the required forces needed for combat. This included its own artillery, engineers, communications, and supply units. The provision of a multi-division expeditionary force, for a war on the continent against a European adversary, was not considered for much of the interwar period by the British government which deemed it unlikely for such a war to occur.

In 1939, the regular army consisted of seven infantry and two armoured divisions. Two of the infantry divisions had been formed for the repression of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. The Territorial Army was intended to be the primary method of expanding the number of divisions available to the army. During the interwar period, the British government reduced the funding and size of the Territorial Army. By 1936, they had concluded that it could not be modernised or equipped for a European war over the following three-year period and therefore delayed further funding. At the beginning of 1939, the Territorial Army had twelve infantry divisions. Following the German occupation of the remnants of the Czechoslovak state in March 1939, the Territorial Army was ordered to double in size to 24 divisions. By the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939, some of these divisions had formed while others were being created.

On 8 September 1939, the British Army announced that it would raise 55 divisions to be deployed to France, as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), for service against Germany. Thirty-two of these formations were to come from the British Army, and rest from the armies of the British Dominions (for example, the Canadian Army) and the British Indian Army. The goal was to fully equip and deploy 20 divisions within the first year of the war and all 55 divisions within two years. The British contingent was to come from the expanded Territorial Army and the regular army divisions based in the UK. By May 1940, the BEF contained only 13 divisions. During the latter stages of the campaign, the Beauman Division was raised from rear-area personnel. As a result of defeat in the Battle of France and the return of the BEF following the Dunkirk evacuation, the original deployment of divisions was not realised. The 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was lost during the Battle of France and it was later reformed by renaming the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division. After the BEF returned to the UK, four infantry divisions were disbanded to reinforce other formations. Colonial regiments in Britain&#x27;s African colonies, including the Nigeria Regiment, Gold Coast Regiment and King&#x27;s African Rifles were expanded in size via new recruitment efforts. This resulted in two new divisions being formed in Africa in mid-1940.

The goal of 55 divisions was increased to 58 in January 1941, then cut to 57 on 6 March; the UK was to provide 36 of these. During 1941, the 2nd Armoured Division in North Africa was overrun, and its headquarters captured. By the end of the year, the British Army had 37 active divisions (one airborne, nine armoured and 27 infantry). On 15 February 1942, the 18th Infantry Division was captured by Japanese forces following the Battle of Singapore. Lack of equipment hindered growth and an increasing number of divisions based in the UK were reduced in size to provide men for formations fighting abroad. By 1943, it became necessary for front line divisions to be cannibalised to provide reinforcements for other formations. During 1943, three new divisions were formed after the further expansion of the African regiments. By 1944, the UK still had 35 divisions, of which 18 were for training or to be used as a pool for reinforcements. By mid-1944, the army did not have enough men to replace the losses suffered by front line infantry units. Transfers of men from the Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force to be retrained as infantry took place, and more formations were disbanded to provide the required reinforcements. By the end of 1944, the army had shrunk to 26 divisions: 5 armoured and 21 infantry (including airborne). In the final year of the war, the number decreased to 24 divisions.

== Airborne ==
Impressed by the German airborne force during the 1940 Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered the creation of a paratrooper force of 5,000 men. The qualified success of Operation Colossus, a small scale commando raid, prompted further expansion of this force, and resulted in an additional requirement for a glider force of 10,000 men to be created. The recruitment for the size of this force took until 1943, by which time two divisions had been formed. The airborne division was to comprise three brigades: two parachute brigades, each with three battalions from the Parachute Regiment, and an &quot;airlanding&quot; brigade of three infantry battalions carried into battle by gliders.The first parachute battalions were formed from volunteers from across the British military. As the airborne force grew, infantry battalions were selected to be converted into parachute battalions. The men were invited to volunteer for parachute service, or assigned to a new unit. The new battalions were then brought up to strength from volunteers from other units. The airlanding battalions came from existing infantry units that were converted to glider infantry, and the soldiers did not have the ability to opt-out.

The , the on-paper strength, was set at 12,148 men, with a large number of automatic weapons assigned to the division. The establishment called for 7,171 bolt-action Lee Enfield rifles, 6,504 Sten submachine guns, 966 Bren light machine guns, and 46 Vickers medium machine guns. Each division was also expected to have 392 PIAT anti-tank weapons, 525 mortars, 100 anti-tank guns, and twenty-seven M116 pack howitzers. Just over 6,000 vehicles—primarily jeeps, motorcycles, and bicycles, but also including 22 Tetrarch light tanks—were authorised for each division. Gliders delivered the heavier equipment.

== Anti-aircraft ==
Between 1935 and the start of the war, the British Army formed anti-aircraft divisions. These formations were part of the Territorial Army, and were not intended to be comparable to other formations such as infantry divisions. The anti-aircraft divisions were assigned to a particular area, which could cover hundreds or thousands of square miles. They varied dramatically in manpower, the number of brigades controlled, and the number of weapons assigned. For example, the 1st Anti-Aircraft Division was assigned to defend London, while the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division was assigned to defend both Scotland and Northern Ireland. In September 1939, Anti-Aircraft Command&#x27;s seven divisions had a combined total of 695 heavy anti-aircraft guns compared to an intended 2,232, and 253 light anti-aircraft guns out of an establishment of 1,200. The divisions also had access to 2,700 searchlights, out of a recommended total of 4,700. By 1941, the divisions had 1,691 heavy guns, 940 light guns, and 4,532 searchlights. At the start of the war, the divisions and their command structure had a total of 106,690 men; manpower increased to 157,319 by July 1940, and was over 300,000 by mid-1941. All of the divisions were disbanded in October 1942 as part of a reorganisation of the anti-aircraft command structure. The divisions were replaced by seven groups, which were intended to reduce the overall number of formations, save manpower, and be more flexible.

== Armoured ==


Between May 1939 and the end of the Second World War, the armoured division went through nine organisational changes. In 1939, it was intended that an armoured division would have 110 light tanks, 217 cruiser tanks, and 24 cruiser tanks equipped with howitzers for close support, as well as 2,500 other vehicles, 9,442 men, and 16 field guns. In 1940, the establishment was changed to two light tanks, 304 cruisers, and 36 close support tanks, with 2,600 vehicles, and 10,750 men. The early armoured formations did not reach these proposed tank strengths. For example, the 1st Armoured Division landed in France, in 1940, with 114 light tanks and 143 cruisers. The 2nd Armoured Division, prior to being deployed to the Middle East in late 1940, peaked at a strength of 256 light tanks and 54 cruisers. By 1942, a division was to consist of 13,235 men with 230 tanks, of which 183 would be cruisers and the rest would be for support, along with around 3,000 other vehicles and 48 field guns. For the final two years of the war, the establishment was set at 14,964 men, 246 medium tanks, 63 light tanks, 27 tanks Crusader self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, 27 tanks that were outfitted as artillery observation posts, 24 field guns, 24 self-propelled field guns, 54 anti-tank guns, and 24 self-propelled anti-tank guns. In July 1944, for example, the Guards, the 7th, and the 11th Armoured Divisions all averaged 250 medium tanks. The Guards had 15,600 men, the 7th had 15,100, and the 11th had 14,400.

The early organisation of the armoured divisions included two armoured brigades (with a total of six armoured regiments) and one support group of two infantry battalions, combat engineers and artillery. The intent of the division was to exploit gaps in the opposing frontline created by the infantry divisions. The armoured divisions were considered &#x27;tank-heavy&#x27;, due to the lack of infantry support to guard the tanks. It took repeated setbacks during the Western Desert campaign before a major reorganisation took place. By 1942, the division had evolved to be based around one armoured brigade containing three armoured regiments and one motorised infantry battalion, the support group was replaced by a three-battalion infantry brigade, and additional support weapons were allocated as divisional assets. However, doctrine still dictated for the artillery, infantry, and tanks to fight separate battles. The artillery would engage opposing anti-tank guns; the infantry would secure captured ground or provide flank protection in confined terrain; and the tanks would move ahead to destroy enemy tanks and disrupt the opposing lines of communication. The division, rather than exploiting gaps, would find itself increasingly being used a battering ram to break through the enemy frontline. The armoured divisions diverged in how they were organised between those that were deployed to Northwest Europe in June 1944, and those operating in Italy. In Italy, the division&#x27;s reconnaissance regiments were equipped with armoured cars, whereas the reconnaissance regiments of those assigned to fight in Northwest Europe were primarily equipped with Cromwell tanks. In Italy, starting in June 1944, the infantry component was increased with a second infantry brigade that was either integrated or attached on an as needed basis. The divisions assigned to Northwest Europe did not have this increased infantry, and it took further setbacks before military planners decided that the tanks and infantry needed to work more closely together. Starting in July 1944, an armoured regiment (including the reconnaissance regiment) was paired with one of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions (three from the infantry brigade, and one motorised infantry battalion assigned to the armoured brigade) to implement this change, although on paper they maintained the existing separate brigade structure.

== Cavalry ==
Prior to the outbreak of the war, the British military promised their French counterparts that the BEF would contain at least one cavalry division that would be dispatched within six months of the outbreak of the war. The division would be formed following the start of hostilities, by Territorial Army regiments that would coalesce. The war establishment was set at 11,097 men, 6,081 horses, and 1,815 vehicles distributed between three brigades, each containing three cavalry regiments. The division was primarily equipped with rifles, and supported by 203 light machine guns, 36 medium machine guns, and 48 field guns. For anti-tank protection, the establishment called for 247 anti-tank rifles. As the only division type to include horses, it was required to have three mobile sections from the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. Doctrine called for the division to be mounted infantry: moving from place to place on horseback, and then dismounting to engage opposing forces.

== County ==

In 1940, following the Battle of France, the UK prepared for a potential Axis invasion. As the year progressed, the size of the Army increased quickly. Newly formed infantry battalions were grouped together to create the county divisions. These formations were around 10,000 men strong, and were assigned to defend the coastlines of threatened sectors of the country and man coastal artillery. These divisions were largely immobile and lacked divisional assets such as artillery, engineers, and reconnaissance forces. This allowed infantry divisions to be freed up from such duties and to form a reserve further inland for counterattacking enemy forces.

These formations maintained their coastal defence role, even after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941; British military planners acknowledged that if the Soviet Union collapsed, Germany could easily transfer substantial forces west. This perceived threat subsided in late 1941, with the arrival of autumn and winter weather and coupled with the production of new equipment for the British Army. The latter allowed the War Office to take steps to better balance the army, with the creation of additional armour and special forces units. Consequently, the county divisions were disbanded or redesignated.

== Infantry ==
The infantry were the backbone of the British Army, and were intended to be mobile and with sufficient integrated artillery to be able to overcome opposing forces. At the start of the war, the infantry were separated into two classes: infantry divisions and motor divisions. Each infantry division had three infantry brigades and three artillery regiments. In 1939, these divisions had an establishment of 13,863 men, 72 field guns, and 2,993 vehicles. The motor division had two motorised infantry brigades and two artillery regiments, with an establishment of 10,136 men, 48 field guns, and 2,326 vehicles. The intended offensive use of the infantry division was to penetrate the enemy&#x27;s defensive line, with the support of infantry tanks from independent tank brigades. Any gap created would then be exploited by armoured divisions, and the subsequent captured territory would be secured by the faster and more mobile motor divisions. The motor division, while being able to transport all of its infantry, was weaker than the infantry division as a result of the decreased amount of manpower and firepower. After the Battle of France, the British Army implemented lessons learnt from the campaign in France, which included the decision to base the standard division around three brigades, and the abandonment of the motor division concept. This change saw four infantry divisions disbanded to reassign troops to the former motor divisions.

The Army was split into two branches: the full-time professional force of regulars, and the part-time Territorial Army. Both branches maintained divisions. By 1939, the Territorial Army&#x27;s intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the army (in contrast to the creation of Kitchener&#x27;s Army during the First World War). All members of the Territorial Army were required to take the general service obligation: if the British Government decided, territorial soldiers could be deployed overseas for combat. This avoided the complications of the First World War-era Territorial Force, whose members were initially not required to leave Britain unless they volunteered for overseas service. The pre-war Territorial Army divisions were referred to as &#x27;the first-line&#x27;. Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, the first-line formations were ordered to create new formations in a process called &#x27;duplicating&#x27;; the new formations were called &#x27;the second-line&#x27;. Planners intended the first-line formations to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered prior recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks, and an increase in supper rations) and then form second-line formations from cadres around which the divisions could be expanded.

In 1941, the divisions were divided between being listed as higher establishment formations, and lower establishment ones. The former were intended for deployment overseas and combat, whereas the latter were restricted to home defence in a static role, and were reduced in size. In 1941, a division was intended to have 17,298 men, who were equipped primarily with rifles. They were to be supplemented by 451 sub-machine guns, 768 light machine guns, 48 medium machine guns, 218 mortars, 72 field guns, 48 anti-tank guns, 48 anti-aircraft guns, and 4,166 vehicles. In 1944, the establishment was increased 18,347 men, 6,525 sub-machine guns, 1,162 light machine guns, 359 mortars, 436 PIAT anti-tank weapons, 72 field guns, 110 anti-tank guns, and 4,330 vehicles. Out of the overall total of men within the division, around 7,000 were frontline infantry and the rest allocated to the various divisional supporting arms and services. The overall strength of a division could vary considerably. For example, during the Siege of Tobruk in 1941, the 70th Infantry Division was 28,000 men strong; in June 1944, the total combined strength of the remaining five lower establishment divisions was 17,845 men; and in July 1944, the higher establishment 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division was 16,970 men strong.

In 1942, the British Army experimented with the format of their infantry formations. Several were converted into &quot;mixed divisions&quot; via the removal of one infantry brigades, and a brigade of tanks being assigned in their place. The concept was deemed not successful, and abandoned the following year. During 1943, the War Office intended to provide eight tank brigades (equipped with infantry tanks) to the army. These would be a corps-level asset that could then be attached to infantry divisions as needed. Due to the lack of infantry tank production, only three such brigades were available. However, several independent armoured brigades (equipped with the M4 Sherman medium tank) were formed. The independent armoured brigades were utilised in the same manner as the tank brigades. In Northwest Europe, infantry divisions had access to specialised tanks from the 79th Armoured Division. These tank formations would be attached to the infantry division as needed.

<text>Upsilon Andromedae (υ Andromedae, abbreviated Upsilon And, υ And) is a binary star located 44 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Andromeda. The system consists of an F-type main-sequence star (designated υ Andromedae A, officially named Titawin in the Amazigh language ) and a smaller red dwarf.

, three extrasolar planets (designated Upsilon Andromedae b, c, d; named Saffar, Samh and Majriti, respectively) are believed to orbit υ Andromedae A. All three are likely to be jovian planets that are comparable in size to Jupiter. This was both the first multiple-planet system to be discovered around a main-sequence star, and the first multiple-planet system known in a multiple-star system.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;υ Andromedae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Upsilon Andromedae&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. Under the rules for naming objects in binary star systems, the two components are designated A and B. Under the same rules, the first planet discovered orbiting υ Andromedae A should be designated υ Andromedae Ab. Though this more formal form is occasionally used to avoid confusion with a secondary star υ Andromedae B, it is more commonly referred to as υ Andromedae b. The other planets discovered were designated υ Andromedae c, d, and e, in order of their discovery.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Titawin for υ Andromedae A and Saffar, Samh and Majriti for three of its planets (b, c and d, respectively).

The winning names were those submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco. The star is named after the Berber name &quot;Tiṭṭawin&quot;, ⵜⵉⵟⵟⴰⵡⵉⵏ, of Morocco&#x27;s Tétouan city and Tunisia&#x27;s Tataouine city, both cities&#x27; old town quarters are considered UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The planets honour the 10th- and 11th-century astronomers Ibn al-Saffar, Ibn al-Samh and Maslama al-Majriti of Muslim Spain.

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Great General&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Upsilon Andromedae, Gamma Andromedae, Phi Persei, 51 Andromedae, 49 Andromedae, Chi Andromedae, Tau Andromedae, 56 Andromedae, Beta Trianguli, Gamma Trianguli and Delta Trianguli. Consequently, the Chinese name for Upsilon Andromedae itself is (, ).

==Stellar system==
Upsilon Andromedae is located fairly close to the Solar System: the parallax of Upsilon Andromedae A was measured by the &quot;Gaia&quot; astrometry satellite as 74.19 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of . Upsilon Andromedae A has an apparent magnitude of +4.09, making it visible to the naked eye even under moderately light-polluted skies, about 10 degrees east of the Andromeda Galaxy.

The Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars and Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) both list two companion stars: magnitude 12.6 UCAC3 263-13722 110&quot; away, listed as component B; and magnitude 10.3 F2 star TYC 2822-2067-1 280&quot; away, listed as component C.

A fainter and closer star, discovered in 2002, is confusingly referred to in the discovery paper as υ Andromedae B even though that designation is also used for a different companion. This 13th-magnitude red dwarf is 55&quot; from υ Andromedae A and is believed to be the only one of the companions physically associated, at the same distance and a projected separation of . It has been added to the WDS as component D.

=== Upsilon Andromedae A ===
Upsilon Andromedae A is a yellow-white dwarf of spectral type F8V, similar to the Sun, but younger, more massive, and more luminous. It is around four billion years old and has a similar proportion of iron relative to hydrogen to the Sun. At around 1.3 solar masses, it will have a shorter lifetime than the Sun. The amount of ultraviolet radiation received by any planets in the star&#x27;s habitable zone would be similar to the ultraviolet flux the Earth receives from the Sun.

The X-ray emission of Upsilon Andromedae A is low for a star of its spectral class. This means that the star may be moving, or move soon, out of the main sequence and expand its radius to become a red giant star. This is consistent with the upper limits on the age of this star.

Upsilon Andromedae A was ranked 21st in the list of top 100 target stars for NASA&#x27;s cancelled Terrestrial Planet Finder mission.

The star rotates at an inclination of degrees relative to Earth.

=== Upsilon Andromedae B ===
The red dwarf companion has a spectral type M4.5V and is located at a projected separation of 750 AU from the primary star. The true separation between the two stars is unknown because the displacement along the line of sight between Earth and the Upsilon Andromedae stars is unknown, so this value is a minimum separation. Based upon its motion through space, this is a common proper motion companion to the primary. It was discovered in 2002 in data collected as part of the 2MASS. The star is less massive and far less luminous than the Sun, and its age seems to be consistent with that of the system.

== Planetary system ==



The innermost planet of the Upsilon Andromedae system was discovered in 1996 and announced in January 1997, together with the planet of Tau Boötis and the innermost planet of 55 Cancri. The discovery was made by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, both astronomers at San Francisco State University. The planet, designated Upsilon Andromedae b, was discovered by measuring changes in the star&#x27;s radial velocity induced by the planet&#x27;s gravity. Because of its closeness to the parent star, it induced a large wobble which was detected relatively easily. The planet appears to be responsible for enhanced activity in the chromosphere of its star.
Even when the first planet was taken into account, there still remained significant residuals in the radial velocity measurements, and it was suggested there might be a second planet in orbit. In 1999, astronomers at both San Francisco State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics independently concluded that a three-planet model best fit the data. The two outer planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae c and Upsilon Andromedae d in order of increasing distance from the star. Both of these planets are in more eccentric orbits than any of the planets in the Solar System (including Pluto). Upsilon Andromedae d resides in the system&#x27;s habitable zone.

The orbital parameters of this three-planet system have been fully determined. The system is not coplanar, with each other or with the stellar rotation, as in our Solar System. Samh, planet c, has an orbit significantly inclined from those of the other two, and from the perspective of Earth is inclined by only about 8 degrees from the celestial sphere; when it was first discovered, it was thought to have a mass closer to only 2 Jupiter masses due to a comparatively small radial velocity signal. Simulations shows that the measured configuration of the planets produces indeed stable orbits for at least 100 million years, where planets &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; remain roughly coplanar. General relativity is expected to have strong effects on planet &quot;b&quot;, because it orbits at a distance of just ~0.05 AU from the parent star. The apsides of planet &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, instead, oscillates with time; the orbit of Upsilon Andromedae c thus returns to a nearly circular state every 9,000 years. The eccentricity of those planets may have arisen from a close encounter between the outer planet and a fourth planet, with the result that the third planet was ejected from the system or destroyed. Such a mechanism could have been triggered by perturbations on the orbit of the companion star, which arise from close encounters with other stars and from the tidal field of the Milky Way. The orbits of the two inner planets seems to be shaped by tidal interactions, while the evolution of &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; orbits is secular.

===Additional planets===
Astronomers initially thought that a fourth planet in this system could not exist because it would have made the planetary system unstable and would have been ejected. But in 2007, an island region of stability was reported where a fourth planet could exist.

The existence of further planets too small or distant to detect has not been ruled out, though the presence of Jupiter-mass planets as close as 5 AU from Upsilon Andromedae A would make the system unstable. However, a potential fourth planet (Upsilon Andromedae e) was discovered in 2010. This planet seems to be in a 3:1 resonance with Upsilon Andromedae d. Subsequent studies in 2011 and 2014, while finding some evidence for a fourth planet, found large inconsistencies in the estimated orbital period of Upsilon Andromedae e depending on what dataset was used, suggesting that the apparent planetary signal is more likely to be an instrumental artifact.

If it exists, Upsilon Andromedae e would have a minimum mass slightly greater than Jupiter&#x27;s and orbit at a similar distance as Jupiter from the Sun, at compared to for Jupiter. Although only the minimum mass is determined since inclination is not yet known, its true mass might be much greater. It would take over a decade to orbit the star. At an eccentricity of 0.00536, the planet&#x27;s orbit would be more circular than that of any of the planets in the Solar System.

Upsilon Andromedae does not appear to have a circumstellar dust disk similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. This may be the result of perturbations from the companion star removing material from the outer regions of the Upsilon Andromedae A system.

<doc id="246806" wikidata="Q192164" url="?curid=246806" title="Ruminant">
<text>Ruminants are herbivorous grazing or browsing artiodactyls belonging to the suborder Ruminantia that are able to acquire nutrients from plant-based food by fermenting it in a specialized stomach prior to digestion, principally through microbial actions. The process, which takes place in the front part of the digestive system and therefore is called foregut fermentation, typically requires the fermented ingesta (known as cud) to be regurgitated and chewed again. The process of rechewing the cud to further break down plant matter and stimulate digestion is called rumination. The word &quot;ruminant&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;ruminare&quot;, which means &quot;to chew over again&quot;.

The roughly 200 species of ruminants include both domestic and wild species. Ruminating mammals include cattle, all domesticated and wild bovines, goats, sheep, giraffes, deer, gazelles, and antelopes. It has also been suggested that notoungulates also relied on rumination, as opposed to other atlantogenatans that rely on the more typical hindgut fermentation, though this is not entirely certain.

Ruminants represent the most diverse group of living ungulates. The suborder Ruminantia includes six different families: Tragulidae, Giraffidae, Antilocapridae, Cervidae, Moschidae, and Bovidae.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The first fossil ruminants appeared in the Early Eocene and were small, likely omnivorous, forest-dwellers. Artiodactyls with cranial appendages first occur in the early Miocene.

===Phylogeny===
Ruminantia is a crown group of ruminants within the order Artiodactyla, cladistically defined by Spaulding et al. as &quot;the least inclusive clade that includes &quot;Bos taurus&quot; (cow) and &quot;Tragulus napu&quot; (mouse deer)&quot;. Ruminantiamorpha is a higher-level clade of artiodactyls, cladistically defined by Spaulding et al. as &quot;Ruminantia plus all extinct taxa more closely related to extant members of Ruminantia than to any other living species.&quot; This is a stem-based definition for Ruminantiamorpha, and is more inclusive than the crown group Ruminantia. As a crown group, Ruminantia only includes the last common ancestor of all extant (living) ruminants and their descendants (living or extinct), whereas Ruminantiamorpha, as a stem group, also includes more basal extinct ruminant ancestors that are more closely related to living ruminants than to other members of Artiodactyla. When considering only living taxa (neontology), this makes Ruminantiamorpha and Ruminantia synonymous, and only Ruminantia is used. Thus, Ruminantiamorpha is only used in the context of paleontology. Accordingly, Spaulding grouped some genera of the extinct family Anthracotheriidae within Ruminantiamorpha (but not in Ruminantia), but placed others within Ruminantiamorpha&#x27;s sister clade, Cetancodontamorpha.

Ruminantia&#x27;s placement within Artiodactyla can be represented in the following cladogram:

Within Ruminantia, the Tragulidae (mouse deer) are considered the most basal family, with the remaining ruminants classified as belonging to the infraorder Pecora. Until the beginning of the 21st century it was understood that the family Moschidae (musk deer) was sister to Cervidae. However, a 2003 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of National Museum of Natural History, France) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, revealed that Moschidae and Bovidae form a clade sister to Cervidae. According to the study, Cervidae diverged from the Bovidae-Moschidae clade 27 to 28 million years ago. The following cladogram is based on a large-scale genome ruminant genome sequence study from 2019:

==Digestive system of ruminants==
Hofmann and Stewart divided ruminants into three major categories based on their feed type and feeding habits: concentrate selectors, intermediate types, and grass/roughage eaters, with the assumption that feeding habits in ruminants cause morphological differences in their digestive systems, including salivary glands, rumen size, and rumen papillae. However, Woodall found that there is little correlation between the fiber content of a ruminant&#x27;s diet and morphological characteristics, meaning that the categorical divisions of ruminants by Hofmann and Stewart warrant further research.

Also, some mammals are pseudoruminants, which have a three-compartment stomach instead of four like ruminants. The Hippopotamidae (comprising hippopotamuses) are well-known examples. Pseudoruminants, like traditional ruminants, are foregut fermentors and most ruminate or chew cud. However, their anatomy and method of digestion differs significantly from that of a four-chambered ruminant.

Monogastric herbivores, such as rhinoceroses, horses, guinea pigs, and rabbits, are not ruminants, as they have a simple single-chambered stomach. Being hindgut fermenters, these animals ferment cellulose in an enlarged cecum. In smaller hindgut fermenters of the order Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, and pikas), and Caviomorph rodents (Guinea pigs, capybaras, etc.), material from the cecum is formed into cecotropes, passed through the large intestine, expelled and subsequently reingested to absorb nutrients in the cecotropes.

The primary difference between ruminants and nonruminants is that ruminants&#x27; stomachs have four compartments:

#rumen—primary site of microbial fermentation 
#reticulum 
#omasum—receives chewed cud, and absorbs volatile fatty acids
#abomasum—true stomach

The first two chambers are the rumen and the reticulum. These two compartments make up the fermentation vat and are the major site of microbial activity. Fermentation is crucial to digestion because it breaks down complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose, and enables the animal to use them. Microbes function best in a warm, moist, anaerobic environment with a temperature range of and a pH between 6.0 and 6.4. Without the help of microbes, ruminants would not be able to use nutrients from forages. The food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud or bolus.

The cud is then regurgitated and chewed to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size. Smaller particle size allows for increased nutrient absorption. Fiber, especially cellulose and hemicellulose, is primarily broken down in these chambers by microbes (mostly bacteria, as well as some protozoa, fungi, and yeast) into the three volatile fatty acids (VFAs): acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. Protein and nonstructural carbohydrate (pectin, sugars, and starches) are also fermented. Saliva is very important because it provides liquid for the microbial population, recirculates nitrogen and minerals, and acts as a buffer for the rumen pH. The type of feed the animal consumes affects the amount of saliva that is produced.

Though the rumen and reticulum have different names, they have very similar tissue layers and textures, making it difficult to visually separate them. They also perform similar tasks. Together, these chambers are called the reticulorumen. The degraded digesta, which is now in the lower liquid part of the reticulorumen, then passes into the next chamber, the omasum. This chamber controls what is able to pass into the abomasum. It keeps the particle size as small as possible in order to pass into the abomasum. The omasum also absorbs volatile fatty acids and ammonia.

After this, the digesta is moved to the true stomach, the abomasum. This is the gastric compartment of the ruminant stomach. The abomasum is the direct equivalent of the monogastric stomach, and digesta is digested here in much the same way. This compartment releases acids and enzymes that further digest the material passing through. This is also where the ruminant digests the microbes produced in the rumen. Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. The small intestine is the main site of nutrient absorption. The surface area of the digesta is greatly increased here because of the villi that are in the small intestine. This increased surface area allows for greater nutrient absorption. Microbes produced in the reticulorumen are also digested in the small intestine. After the small intestine is the large intestine. The major roles here are breaking down mainly fiber by fermentation with microbes, absorption of water (ions and minerals) and other fermented products, and also expelling waste. Fermentation continues in the large intestine in the same way as in the reticulorumen.

Only small amounts of glucose are absorbed from dietary carbohydrates. Most dietary carbohydrates are fermented into VFAs in the rumen. The glucose needed as energy for the brain and for lactose and milk fat in milk production, as well as other uses, comes from nonsugar sources, such as the VFA propionate, glycerol, lactate, and protein. The VFA propionate is used for around 70% of the glucose and glycogen produced and protein for another 20% (50% under starvation conditions).

==Abundance, distribution, and domestication==
Wild ruminants number at least 75 million and are native to all continents except Antarctica and Australia. Nearly 90% of all species are found in Eurasia and Africa. Species inhabit a wide range of climates (from tropic to arctic) and habitats (from open plains to forests).

The population of domestic ruminants is greater than 3.5 billion, with cattle, sheep, and goats accounting for about 95% of the total population. Goats were domesticated in the Near East &quot;circa&quot; 8000 BC. Most other species were domesticated by 2500 BC., either in the Near East or southern Asia.

==Ruminant physiology==
Ruminating animals have various physiological features that enable them to survive in nature. One feature of ruminants is their continuously growing teeth. During grazing, the silica content in forage causes abrasion of the teeth. This is compensated for by continuous tooth growth throughout the ruminant&#x27;s life, as opposed to humans or other nonruminants, whose teeth stop growing after a particular age. Most ruminants do not have upper incisors; instead, they have a thick dental pad to thoroughly chew plant-based food. Another feature of ruminants is the large ruminal storage capacity that gives them the ability to consume feed rapidly and complete the chewing process later. This is known as rumination, which consists of the regurgitation of feed, rechewing, resalivation, and reswallowing. Rumination reduces particle size, which enhances microbial function and allows the digesta to pass more easily through the digestive tract.

Unlike camelids, ruminants copulate in a standing position and are not Induced ovulators.

==Rumen microbiology==

Vertebrates lack the ability to hydrolyse the beta [1–4] glycosidic bond of plant cellulose due to the lack of the enzyme cellulase. Thus, ruminants completely depend on the microbial flora, present in the rumen or hindgut, to digest cellulose. Digestion of food in the rumen is primarily carried out by the rumen microflora, which contains dense populations of several species of bacteria, protozoa, sometimes yeasts and other fungi – 1 ml of rumen is estimated to contain 10–50 billion bacteria and 1 million protozoa, as well as several yeasts and fungi.

Since the environment inside a rumen is anaerobic, most of these microbial species are obligate or facultative anaerobes that can decompose complex plant material, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, and proteins. The hydrolysis of cellulose results in sugars, which are further fermented to acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate, carbon dioxide, and methane.

As bacteria conduct fermentation in the rumen, they consume about 10% of the carbon, 60% of the phosphorus, and 80% of the nitrogen that the ruminant ingests. To reclaim these nutrients, the ruminant then digests the bacteria in the abomasum. The enzyme lysozyme has adapted to facilitate digestion of bacteria in the ruminant abomasum. Pancreatic ribonuclease also degrades bacterial RNA in the ruminant small intestine as a source of nitrogen.

During grazing, ruminants produce large amounts of saliva – estimates range from 100 to 150 litres of saliva per day for a cow. The role of saliva is to provide ample fluid for rumen fermentation and to act as a buffering agent. Rumen fermentation produces large amounts of organic acids, thus maintaining the appropriate pH of rumen fluids is a critical factor in rumen fermentation. After digesta passes through the rumen, the omasum absorbs excess fluid so that digestive enzymes and acid in the abomasum are not diluted.

==Tannin toxicity in ruminant animals==
Tannins are phenolic compounds that are commonly found in plants. Found in the leaf, bud, seed, root, and stem tissues, tannins are widely distributed in many different species of plants. Tannins are separated into two classes: hydrolysable tannins and condensed tannins. Depending on their concentration and nature, either class can have adverse or beneficial effects. Tannins can be beneficial, having been shown to increase milk production, wool growth, ovulation rate, and lambing percentage, as well as reducing bloat risk and reducing internal parasite burdens.

Tannins can be toxic to ruminants, in that they precipitate proteins, making them unavailable for digestion, and they inhibit the absorption of nutrients by reducing the populations of proteolytic rumen bacteria. Very high levels of tannin intake can produce toxicity that can even cause death. Animals that normally consume tannin-rich plants can develop defensive mechanisms against tannins, such as the strategic deployment of lipids and extracellular polysaccharides that have a high affinity to binding to tannins. Some ruminants (goats, deer, elk, moose) are able to consume food high in tannins (leaves, twigs, bark) due to the presence in their saliva of tannin-binding proteins.

==Religious importance==
The Law of Moses in the Bible allowed the eating of some mammals that had cloven hooves (i.e. members of the order Artiodactyla) and &quot;that chew the cud&quot;, a stipulation preserved to this day in Jewish dietary laws.

==Other uses==
The verb &#x27;to ruminate&#x27; has been extended metaphorically to mean to ponder thoughtfully or to meditate on some topic. Similarly, ideas may be &#x27;chewed on&#x27; or &#x27;digested&#x27;. &#x27;Chew the (one&#x27;s) cud&#x27; is to reflect or meditate. In psychology, &quot;rumination&quot; refers to a pattern of thinking, and is unrelated to digestive physiology.

==Ruminants and climate change==
Methane is produced by a type of archaea, called methanogens, as described above within the rumen, and this methane is released to the atmosphere. The rumen is the major site of methane production in ruminants. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 86 compared to CO2 over a 20-year period.

As a by-product of consuming cellulose, cattle belch out methane, there-by returning that carbon sequestered by plants back into the atmosphere. After about 10 to 12 years, that methane is broken down and converted back to . Once converted to , plants can again perform photosynthesis and fix that carbon back into cellulose. From here, cattle can eat the plants and the cycle begins once again. In essence, the methane belched from cattle is not adding new carbon to the atmosphere. Rather it is part of the natural cycling of carbon through the biogenic carbon cycle.

In 2010, enteric fermentation accounted for 43% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from all agricultural activity in the world, 26% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activity in the U.S., and 22% of the total U.S. methane emissions. The meat from domestically raised ruminants has a higher carbon equivalent footprint than other meats or vegetarian sources of protein based on a global meta-analysis of lifecycle assessment studies. Methane production by meat animals, principally ruminants, is estimated 15–20% global production of methane, unless the animals were hunted in the wild. The current U.S. domestic beef and dairy cattle population is around 90 million head, approximately 50% higher than the peak wild population of American bison of 60 million head in the 1700s, which primarily roamed the part of North America that now makes up the United States.

<doc id="246816" wikidata="Q1191714" url="?curid=246816" title="Blue-collar worker">
<text>A blue-collar worker is a person who performs manual labor or skilled trades. Blue-collar work may involve skilled or unskilled labor. The type of work may involve manufacturing, retail, warehousing, mining, excavation, carpentry, electricity generation and power plant operations, electrical construction and maintenance, custodial work, farming, commercial fishing, logging, landscaping, pest control, food processing, oil field work, waste collection and disposal, recycling, construction, maintenance, shipping, driving, trucking, and many other types of physical work. Blue-collar work often involves something being physically built or maintained. In social status, blue-collar workers generally belong to the working class.

In contrast, the white-collar worker typically performs work in an office environment and may involve sitting at a computer or desk. A third type of work is a service worker (pink collar) whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales or other service-oriented work. Particularly those service jobs that have historically been female dominated such as nurses, teachers, early childhood educators, florists, etc. Many occupations blend blue, white, or pink-collar work and are often paid hourly wage-labor, although some professionals may be paid by the project or salaried. There are a wide range of payscales for such work depending upon field of specialty and experience.

==Origin of term==

The term blue collar was first used in reference to trades jobs in 1924, in an Alden, Iowa newspaper. The phrase stems from the image of manual workers wearing blue denim or chambray shirts as part of their uniforms. Industrial and manual workers often wear durable canvas or cotton clothing that may be soiled during the course of their work. Navy and light blue colors conceal potential dirt or grease on the worker&#x27;s clothing, helping them to appear cleaner. For the same reason, blue is a popular color for boilersuits which protect workers&#x27; clothing. Some blue collar workers have uniforms with the name of the business or the individual&#x27;s name embroidered or printed on it.

Historically, the popularity of the colour blue among manual labourers contrasts with the popularity of white dress shirts worn by people in office environments. The blue collar/white collar colour scheme has socio-economic class connotations. However, this distinction has become blurred with the increasing importance of skilled labor, and the relative increase in low-paying white-collar jobs.

==Educational requirements==

Since many blue-collar jobs consist of mainly manual labor, educational requirements for workers are typically lower than those of white-collar workers. Often, not even a high school diploma is required, and many of the skills required for blue-collar jobs are learned by the employee while working. In higher level blue collar jobs, such as becoming an electrician or plumber, vocational training or apprenticeships are required and state-certification is also necessary. For this reason, it is common to apply the label &quot;blue collar&quot; or &quot;working class&quot; to people without a college education, whether or not they work in a blue-collar job. Some people who find themselves in academic jobs who were raised by parents or belong to families that are predominately blue-collar may take on some of the habits, processes, and philosophies utilized by laborers and workers. Some of these students, staff, and faculty refer to themselves as blue-collar scholars. 

==Blue collar shift to developing nations==
With the Information Age, Western nations have moved towards a service and white-collar economy. Many manufacturing jobs have been offshored to developing nations which pay their workers lower wages. This offshoring has pushed formerly agrarian nations to industrialized economies and concurrently decreased the number of blue-collar jobs in developed countries. However, in many of these countries, such as the United States, the supply of blue collar labor (especially skilled trades) has declined faster than demand for these services has fallen. Driven by a gradually aging blue collar workforce and shifting preferences towards higher education, this trend was exacerbated during the COVID pandemic. 

In the U.S., blue collar and service occupations generally refer to jobs in precision production, craft, and repair occupations; machine operators and inspectors; transportation and moving occupations; handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers, and laborers.

=== Rust Belt ===

In the U.S., an area known as the Rust Belt, comprising the Northeast and Midwest, including Western New York and Western Pennsylvania, has seen its once large manufacturing base shrink significantly. With the deindustrialization of these areas beginning in the mid-1960s and accelerating throughout the late 20th century, cities like Allentown, Bethlehem, Erie, and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Toledo, and Youngstown in Ohio; Detroit in Michigan; Buffalo and Rochester in New York; and St. Louis in Missouri experienced a steady decline of their blue-collar workforce, subsequent population decreases, and high unemployment, poverty, and urban blight associated with Rust Belt economies.

==Adjective==

Blue-collar can be used as an adjective to describe the environment of the blue-collar worker or a setting reflective of that environment, such as a &quot;blue-collar&quot; neighborhood, restaurant, or bar.

<doc id="246818" wikidata="Q255274" url="?curid=246818" title="White-collar worker">
<text>Awhite-collar worker is a person who performs professional service, desk, managerial, or administrative work. White-collar work may be performed in an office or other administrative setting. White-collar workers include job paths related to government, consulting, academia, accountancy, business and executive management, customer support, design, economics, science, technology, engineering, market research, finance, human resources, operations research, marketing,  public relations, real estate, information technology, networking, law, healthcare, architecture, and research and development.

In contrast, blue-collar workers perform manual labor or work in skilled trades; pink-collar workers work in care, health care, social work, or teaching; green-collar workers specifically work in the environmental sector; and grey-collar jobs combine manual labor and skilled trades with non-manual or managerial duties.

==Etymology==
The term refers to the white dress shirts of male office workers common through most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Western countries, as opposed to the blue overalls worn by many manual laborers.

The term &quot;white collar&quot; is credited to Upton Sinclair, an American writer, in relation to contemporary clerical, administrative, and management workers during the 1930s, though references to white-collar work appear as early as 1935. White collar employees are considered highly educated and talented as compared to blue collar.

==Health effects==
Less physical activity among white-collar workers has been thought to be a key factor in increased life-style related health conditions such as fatigue, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and heart disease. Also, working at a computer could potentially lead to diseases associated with monotonous data entry such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Workplace interventions such as alternative activity workstations, sit-stand desks, and promotion of stair use are among measures being implemented to counter the harms of sedentary workplace environments. The quality of evidence used to determine the effectiveness and potential health benefits of many of these interventions is weak. More research is needed to determine which interventions may be effective in the long-term. Low quality evidence indicates that sit-stand desks may reduce sitting in the workplace during the first year of their use; however, it is not clear if sit-stand desks may be effective at reducing sitting in the longer-term. An intervention to encourage office workers to stand and move reduced their sitting time by 22 minutes after 1 year; the effect was 3-times greater when the intervention included a sit-to-stand desk. The intervention also led to small improvements in stress, wellbeing and vigour.

==Demographics==
Formerly a minority in the agrarian and early industrial societies, white-collar workers have become a majority in industrialized countries due to modernization and outsourcing of manufacturing jobs.

The blue-collar and white-collar phrases may no longer be literally accurate, as office attire has broadened beyond a white shirt. Employees in many offices may dress in colourful casual or business casual clothes. In addition, the work tasks have blurred. &quot;White-collar&quot; employees may perform &quot;blue-collar&quot; tasks (or vice versa). An example would be a restaurant manager who may wear more formal clothing yet still assist with cooking food or taking customers&#x27; orders, or a construction worker who also performs desk work.

<doc id="246820" wikidata="Q2333474" url="?curid=246820" title="Deftones (album)">
<text>Deftones is the fourth studio album by the American alternative metal band Deftones, released on May 20, 2003, by Maverick Records. The album features a strong change in musical direction from the band&#x27;s previous albums, ranging from some of their heavier compositions to moody trip hop and shoegaze influences. It was also the band&#x27;s last release to be produced by Terry Date until &quot;Ohms&quot; in 2020.

==Background==
Originally titled &quot;Lovers&quot;, the album was instead given an eponymous title because singer Chino Moreno considered &quot;Lovers&quot; too obvious in relation to the context of its material (the former title song &quot;Lovers&quot; did appear as a b-side on the UK &quot;Hexagram&quot; single). Terry Date was frustrated by the very slow pace of the band working in the studio.

==Musical style==
&quot;Deftones&quot; is an eclectic album, with songs spanning many different ideas in diverse genres. It has a much different feel than prior efforts, due in small part to Frank Delgado leaving his turntables behind and instead focusing on playing keyboards and synthesizers for a majority of the songs. Most of the album&#x27;s songs make extensive use of the band&#x27;s low G# tuning, resulting in some of the heaviest songs in the band&#x27;s catalog. On the other hand, the track &quot;Lucky You&quot; is a dark, soft, trip hop-influenced piece featuring DJ Crook from Moreno&#x27;s side project Team Sleep and vocalist Rey Osburn of Tinfed. A grand piano and toy piano were featured in the mournful &quot;Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event&quot;.

In addition to trip hop influences, significant shoegaze elements have been noted on the album, especially in regards to the song &quot;Minerva&quot;.

==Promotion==
&quot;Deftones&quot; produced two singles, &quot;Minerva&quot; and &quot;Hexagram&quot;. Music videos were shot for both singles as well as the track &quot;Bloody Cape&quot;, which was also intended to be a single, but was released in limited editions for promotional purposes only. The latter&#x27;s video was only available on the band&#x27;s official website for one day, but was later released on the DVD portion of the band&#x27;s &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;. As the lead single, &quot;Minerva&quot; featured a melodic, commercially viable sound and gained strong rotation on mainstream rock video programming. In contrast, the heavier, more abrasive sound of &quot;Hexagram&quot; landed it on metal-themed shows such as &quot;Uranium&quot; and &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

&quot;Battle-Axe&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2&quot;, while &quot;Minerva&quot; was featured in &quot;True Crime: Streets of LA&quot;, NHL 2004, &quot;House of Wax&quot;, and also as downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Deftones&quot; received an aggregate rating of 74 on Metacritic, which indicated generally positive reviews. However, the album was not as well received as its predecessor &quot;White Pony&quot;, and, at the time of its release, it received some reviews ranging from marginal to negative from critics. Upon its release, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as a disappointment compared to the rest of the band&#x27;s catalogue.

&quot;Q&quot; praised the album, giving it 4.5 out of 5 stars, stating, &quot;In a genre considered creatively bankrupt, this is genuinely new metal&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated, &quot;This is metal that crushes, then soothes; collapses, then soars... Deftones just blow open the possibilities&quot;.

In 2016, Jonathan Dick of NPR Music retrospectively noted the album&#x27;s &quot;trip-hop nuances&quot; and included the album as an example of Deftones&#x27; varied catalogue, stating that &quot;Deftones&#x27; catalogue reads like a case study in how a band can translate influences into a sound that&#x27;s definitively their own.&quot; The track &quot;Minerva&quot; was placed at spot number 12 in &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;&#x27;s article &quot;The Top 20 Deftones Song&quot;, with Jon Hadusek claiming that &quot;[in] a way, Deftones brought shoegaze to the alternative metal mainstream with &#x27;Minerva&#x27;, a crushingly heavy, textured jam indebted to &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;-era Smashing Pumpkins and Hum [...]&quot; Hadusek further stated that the track was &quot;far-and-away the best track&quot; of the self-titled album and that the track &quot;hints at the dreamier directions&quot; that Deftones would continue to explore.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the album a moderate score but criticized the band for returning to their heavy style, instead of the more soft and artistic style of its predecessor, &quot;White Pony&quot;.

&quot;Spin&quot; also gave the album a marginal score, but complained about the album&#x27;s notable darkness, saying, &quot;On their fourth album, Deftones are sad as hell, and they&#x27;re not gonna take it anymore; this is less an 11-song album than a single long-form mope&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; reacted negatively to the album, describing the album as pretentious and as a bizarre departure from their previous work, claiming &quot;Deftones sounds more like a band in the throws of a mid-life crisis than a group of musicians that could be called the &#x27;Radiohead of Metal&#x27;. This is music on the fence-post of popular pining and dulled experimentation, an anachronistic addition to an otherwise respectable discography, and it will be remembered as such.&quot;

Playlouder gave the album a negative review, criticizing the album&#x27;s droning melodic songwriting structures, proclaiming: &quot;it&#x27;s why this album almost completely fails to deliver on that promise. When Chino&#x27;s not screaming, he&#x27;s generally busy turning &#x27;Deftones&#x27; into &#x27;Tonedef&#x27;, improvising a series of randomly-pitched moans which seem never to have shared so much as a rehearsal room with their generic metal backing, let alone a chord sequence.&quot;

During a 2020 interview with Metal Injection, frontman Chino Moreno expressed his dissatisfaction of the album for both personal and musical reasons.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Deftones&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, behind Staind&#x27;s &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot;, one spot higher than its predecessor. The album also debuted at No. 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 10,700 copies in its first week of release in Canada. The album sold 167,000 copies in its first week of release in America, outselling the previous album. Despite the strong initial sales, it quickly became apparent that the album did not match the success of &quot;White Pony&quot; after its first month; the band&#x27;s label described it as a commercial disappointment. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on July 7, 2003. To date, it was the highest-charting debut for any album by the band; it would manage to sell over 492,000 copies in the U.S. by 2005.

<doc id="246826" wikidata="Q6564788" url="?curid=246826" title="List of British Commands and Army groups">
<text>This is a list of [[British Army]] [[Command (military formation)|commands]] and [[army group]]s. It is intended as a central point of access information about British formations of that size. It does not cover formations of the British Indian Army.

In 1905, the army established a series of geographical military districts, known as &quot;commands&quot;, to replace six army corps that had existed for a short period. Among the new commands was Aldershot Command. The purpose of the commands was to administer all units and formations located within their geographical borders, and if needed could be further subdivided into &quot;areas&quot;. In 1939, it was one of the army&#x27;s six regional commands, which existed within the British Isles, on the outbreak of the Second World War. Its geographical area encompassed parts of the following four counties: Berkshire, Hampshire, Surrey, and Sussex. 

Commands were placed under the control of a general officer commanding who was assisted by an assortment of staff officers, which were subdivided between the General Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, as well as the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Army Medical Corps, and various other regiments and corps.

<doc id="246827" wikidata="Q6564755" url="?curid=246827" title="List of British armies in World War II">
<text>During the Second World War, the British Army created several field armies. There were formations that controlled multiple army corps, which in turn controlled numerous divisions. An army would also control additional artillery, engineers, and logistical units that would be used to support the subordinate corps and divisions as needed. Each army was generally under the control of a higher formation, such as an army group or a command. Over the course of the war, eight armies were formed. An attempt to form a ninth – the Second British Expeditionary Force, the second overall – was made, and one regional command was redesignated as an army for a short period. Inter-allied co-operation resulted in the creation of the First Allied Airborne Army, and deception efforts saw a further four armies existed within the British military structure. Seventeen armies, real or fictitious, were created, although they did not all exist at the same time.

The first army-level command, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), was formed in September 1939 following the outbreak of the war and dispatched to France. It provides a complicated example of an army chain of command. Its commander General John Vereker, the Viscount Gort, was in control of the BEF and all British forces in France. While being responsible to report to a high-level French command, he was also made a subordinate of a French army group and was also under the command of the main British headquarters in London. An example of a simpler chain of command is provided by the Fourteenth Army that reported only to the 11th Army Group. The final army formed during the war was the Twelfth Army, which was created in May 1945.

Within the British military, armies were commanded by lieutenant-generals. For a variety of reasons, once the appointment was made, commanders could be promoted to a full general. There were several exceptions to this norm; John Vereker was a full general when he was placed in command of the BEF, as was Henry Maitland Wilson when he was chosen to lead the Ninth Army. General Claude Auchinleck was commander-in-chief of all forces based in the Middle East when he decided to take over personal command of the Eighth Army.

The size, composition, and strength of an army could dramatically vary. The BEF, the primary British force in 1940, was thirteen divisions strong and had a strength of around 394,000 men by May 1940. It was composed entirely of British formations. Others, such as the Eighth Army, were composed of forces from multiple nations. At the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Eighth Army had around 195,000 men consisting of Australian, British, French, Greek, Indian, New Zealand, and South African troops spread over eleven divisions and several additional brigades. In 1945, the Eighth Army was 632,980 men strong spread over eight divisions, various brigades, and other smaller units. It was then composed of British, Indian, Italian, New Zealand, and Polish troops, as well as the men of the Jewish Infantry Brigade. The Fourteenth Army, which fought in British India and Burma, was the largest British army-level formation assembled during the war. It commanded around one million soldiers from Britain, British India, and the British African colonies.

==Armies==

===British Expeditionary Force===
The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was dispatched to France at the outbreak of the Second World War. It was originally intended to be split into two armies as additional British forces arrived. By May 1940, when the Battle of Belgium and France began, this had not occurred. The following month, it was forced to withdraw to the UK and the headquarters was dissolved. 

===Second British Expeditionary Force===
Following the evacuation of the BEF, in May–June 1940, large numbers of British forces remained in France. The British government was determined to reinforce the French and prepared to dispatch a Second British Expeditionary Force as soon as forces became available. This coincided with a French proposal to form a national redoubt in Brittany that would use the new BEF – initially one British and one Canadian division, in addition to the forces still in France – and the remnants of the French Army. This plan proved impracticable; the French military was disintegrating and the British withdrew all remaining forces from France via operations Aerial and Cycle.

===First Allied Airborne Army===
The First Allied Airborne Army was formed on 2 August 1944 as the Combined Airborne Force. It was redesignated as the First Airborne Army on 18 August, and controlled American and British airborne corps. In turn, the corps commanded American, British, and Polish airborne formations. The majority of the army&#x27;s staff, including the general officer commanding, were American. A British officer was second-in-command. The army oversaw the Anglo-American airborne element in Operation Market Garden, controlled American airborne forces that fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and commanded the Anglo-American landings during Operation Varsity. The army was disbanded on 20 May 1945.

===First Army===
The headquarters of the First Army was originally formed in July 1941 as Force 110, which subsequently became the &quot;Expeditionary Force&quot; in March 1942 and then First Army on 10 July 1942. The army was dispatched to fight in North Africa and was disbanded following the end of the Tunisian Campaign. A contemporaneous First Army document described the badge as representing the UK and its strength in a crusade against evil.

===Second Army===
The Second Army controlled Anglo-Canadian forces during the invasion of Normandy in France, and then advanced east. It entered Germany in the final stages of the war in Europe. On 24 and 25 June 1945, with the war in Europe over, the army was disbanded and its subordinate formations became an integral part of the military government in the British occupation zone in Germany.|

===Fourth Army===
Scottish Command created and maintained the ruse of the Fourth Army, with the lion of their own insignia replaced with a mediaeval-style numeral four. The deception formation threatened an Allied invasion of German-occupied Norway during 1943 (Operation Tindall). The Fourth Army was recreated for the same task in 1944 (Operation Fortitude North). In July 1944, the formation joined the deceptive First United States Army Group (Fortitude South II). Later in the year, it was used to project a threat towards the Netherlands and Germany. In early 1945, German intelligence were informed that the army had been used as a source of reinforcements for formations abroad fighting and that it was then merged with Northern Command.

===Sixth Army===
Sixth Army was formed by Eastern Command for deception purposes. It was used to pose a threat to any coast of north-eastern Europe but was not actively employed in any deception effort after 1943. German intelligence maintained it on the British order of battle until the end of the war.

===South-Eastern Army===
When Bernard Montgomery took command of South-Eastern Command in December 1941, he renamed it the South-Eastern Army. When Montgomery&#x27;s successor took over, the formation reverted to its prior title.

===Eighth Army===
Initially formed as the Western Army on 10 September 1941, it was redesignated as the Eighth Army sixteen days later. The Imperial War Museum wrote that the insignia was based on a crusader shield and the initial design may have included a red cross. The museum noted that versions of this initial design exist, but it is not known how widely distributed they were. Red was replaced by yellow due to the concern the former could be confused with the logo of the Red Cross. The army fought throughout the North African Campaign, landed and advanced through Italy, and by the end of the war was located in Austria. It was disbanded on 29 July 1945 and its forces were used to form the command British Troops Austria.

===Ninth Army===
The Ninth Army was created to control British-led forces in the eastern Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. Its mission was to counter any Axis advance via Turkey.

===Tenth Army===
The Tenth Army controlled forces based in Iran and Iraq and maintained the supply line from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. As the German 1942 offensive entered the Caucasus, a threat to British interests in the Middle East emerged and the army was to counter any such advance. The insignia depicted a lion in an Assyrian style.

===Twelfth Army===
Twelfth Army was a notional army formed in 1943 for deception purposes. It was used to pose a threat towards Crete and southern Greece, in an effort to divert Axis attention away from Italy and the pending Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). During 1944, the threat switched from Greece to the Italian Province of Pola. Afterwards, it was notionally transferred to British India and was used to threaten an Allied invasion of Sumatra during 1945. This deception ended when an actual Twelfth Army was activated.

===Twelfth Army===
Twelfth Army was formed to manage the final stage of the Burma campaign in 1945. The insignia depicted a Burmese dragon.

===Fourteenth Army===
Formed from the British Indian Army&#x27;s Eastern Army, Fourteenth Army was the largest British field army during the war. The Imperial War Museum wrote; &quot;at one point it held the longest battle line, from the Bay of Bengal to the borders of India and China&quot;. It fought in India and Burma from 1943 until 1945, when it was withdrawn and replaced by the Twelfth Army. It was intended that the Fourteenth Army would conduct a combat landing to liberate British Malaya, but the war ended before that occurred and it peacefully entered Malaya in September. Fourteenth Army was renamed Malaya Command on 1 November 1945 .The army was disbanded on 1 November 1945.

<text>Forage is a plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term &quot;forage&quot; has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage.

While the term &quot;forage&quot; has a broad definition, the term forage crop is used to define crops, annual or biennial, which are grown to be utilized by grazing or harvesting as a whole crop.

<text>Elliott Cook Carter Jr. (December 11, 1908 – November 5, 2012) was an American modernist composer who was one of the most respected composers of the second half of the 20th century. He combined elements of European modernism and American &quot;ultra-modernism&quot; into a distinctive style with a personal harmonic and rhythmic language, after an early neoclassical phase. His compositions are performed throughout the world, and include orchestral, chamber music, solo instrumental, and vocal works. Carter was the recipient of many awards – he was twice awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his string quartets. He also wrote the large-scale orchestral triptych &quot;&quot;.

Carter was born in New York City. He developed an interest in modern music in the 1920s. He was later introduced to Charles Ives, and he soon came to appreciate the American ultra-modernists. After studying at Harvard University with Edward Burlingame Hill, Gustav Holst and Walter Piston, he studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris in the 1930s, then returned to the United States. Carter was productive in his later years, publishing more than 40 works between the ages of 90 and 100, and over 20 more after he turned 100 in 2008. He completed his last work, &quot;Epigrams&quot; for piano trio, on August 13, 2012.

==Biography==
Elliott Cook Carter Jr. was born in Manhattan on December 11, 1908, the son of a wealthy lace importer, Elliott Carter Sr., and the former Florence Chambers. Much of his childhood was spent in Europe; he spoke French before learning English. As a teenager he developed an interest in music, although his parents did not encourage his interests other than providing for early piano lessons. However, he was encouraged by Charles Ives, who sold insurance to Carter&#x27;s family. While a student at the Horace Mann School in 1922, he wrote an admiring letter to Ives, who responded and urged him to pursue his interest in music. He began to be interested in modern music as part of his broader exploration of modernism in various other art forms.

In 1924, the 15-year-old Carter was in the audience and &quot;galvanized&quot; when Pierre Monteux conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) in the New York première of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;. Carter later came to appreciate the American ultra-modernists: Henry Cowell, Edgard Varèse, Ruth Crawford and, later, Conlon Nancarrow. Ives often accompanied Carter to BSO concerts conducted by Serge Koussevitzky, who programmed contemporary works frequently, and then returned to Ives&#x27; home to critique and parody the so-called tricks of Debussy, Stravinsky or Prokofiev, who were composing European new music that Ives considered only &#x27;superficially modern&#x27;.

Starting in 1926, Carter attended Harvard University, where he majored in English but also studied music, both at Harvard (whose music course did not satisfy him) and at the nearby Longy School of Music, and also sang with the Harvard Glee Club. His Harvard professors included Walter Piston and Gustav Holst. Carter earned a master&#x27;s degree in music from Harvard in 1932, but the course did not help make much progress in his compositional skills. Hence, Carter then moved to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger, both privately and at the École Normale de Musique de Paris. He worked with Boulanger from 1932 to 1935 (though he did not compose much music with her that he believed was worth preserving) and in the latter year received a doctorate in music (Mus.D.).

Later in 1935, he returned to the US to write music for the Ballet Caravan. The founder of the Ballet Caravan Lincoln Kirstein commissioned Carter to compose two ballets, &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;The Minotaur&quot;, which would be among his longest works he composed during his Neo-classicist phase, though neither of them was greatly successful.

On July 6, 1939, Carter married Helen Frost-Jones. They had one child, a son, David Chambers Carter. He lived with his wife in the same apartment in Greenwich Village from the time they bought it in 1945 to her death in 2003.

From 1940 to 1944, he taught at St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland. He worked for the Office of War Information during World War II. After the war, he held teaching posts at the Peabody Conservatory (1946–1948), Columbia University, Queens College, New York (1955–56), Yale University (1960–62), Cornell University (from 1967) and the Juilliard School (from 1972). Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Carter, having edited Ives&#x27; music, turned back to his interest in the experimentalists. In response to his experience in the war, he decided to achieve an emancipated musical discourse through re-examination of all parameters of music. Notable works during this time were the &quot;Cello Sonata&quot;, the rhythmically complex first string quartet and Variations for Orchestra. The latter two marked Carter&#x27;s turning point in his career.

Carter wrote music every morning until his death, of natural causes, on November 5, 2012, at his home in New York City, at age 103.

== Premieres and notable performances ==
Carter composed his only opera, &quot;What Next?&quot;, in 1997–98 for the Berlin State Opera at the behest of conductor Daniel Barenboim. The work premiered in Berlin in 1999 and had its first staging in the United States at the Tanglewood Music Festival in 2006, conducted by James Levine. He later considered writing operas on the themes of communal suicide and a story by Henry James, but abandoned both ideas and resolved to write no more operas.

&quot;Interventions for Piano and Orchestra&quot; received its premiere on December 5, 2008, by the BSO, conducted by James Levine and featuring the pianist Daniel Barenboim at Symphony Hall, Boston. On December 11, 2008, Barenboim reprised the work with the BSO at Carnegie Hall in New York in the presence of the composer on his 100th birthday. Carter was also present at the 2009 Aldeburgh Festival to hear the world premiere of his song cycle &quot;On Conversing with Paradise&quot;, based on Ezra Pound&#x27;s Canto 81 and one of Pound&#x27;s &#x27;Notes&#x27; intended for later Cantos, and usually published at the end of the Cantos. The premiere was given on June 20, 2009, by the baritone Leigh Melrose and the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group conducted by Oliver Knussen.

&quot;Figment V&quot; for marimba was premiered in New York on May 2, 2009, by Simon Boyar, and &quot;Poems of Louis Zukofsky&quot; for soprano and clarinet had its first performance by Lucy Shelton and Thomas Martin at the Tanglewood Festival on August 9, 2009. The US premiere of the Flute Concerto took place on February 4, 2010, with the flutist Elizabeth Rowe and the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine. The last premiere of Carter&#x27;s lifetime was &quot;Dialogues II&quot;, written for Barenboim&#x27;s 70th birthday and conducted in Milan in October 2012 by Gustavo Dudamel. The last Carter premiere ever, which happened after Carter&#x27;s death, was &quot;The American Sublime&quot;, a work for baritone and large ensemble, dedicated to and conducted by Levine.

==Musical style and language==
Carter&#x27;s earlier works were influenced by Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, and Paul Hindemith, and are mainly neoclassical. He had strict training in counterpoint, from medieval polyphony to Stravinsky, and this shows in his earliest music, such as the ballet &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1938–39). Some of his music during the Second World War is fairly diatonic, and includes a melodic lyricism reminiscent of Samuel Barber.

Starting in the late 1940s his music shows an increasing development of a personal harmonic and rhythmic language characterized by elaborate rhythmic layering and metric modulation. While Carter&#x27;s chromaticism and tonal vocabulary parallels serial composers of the period, Carter did not use serial techniques. Carter said, &quot;I certainly have never used a twelve-tone row as the basis of a composition, in the way described in Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Style and Idea&quot;, nor are my compositions a constant rotation of various permutations of twelve-tone rows&quot;. Rather, he independently developed and catalogued all possible collections of pitches (i.e., all possible three-note chords, five-note chords, etc.), compiling what he called his &quot;Harmony Book&quot;. (An edited version of the book was published in 2002 by Carl Fischer Music.) Musical theorists like Allen Forte independently had systematized these data into musical set theory perhaps having been inspired by Howard Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Harmonic Materials of Modern Music&quot;. A series of Carter&#x27;s works in the 1960s and 1970s generates its tonal material by using all possible chords of a particular number of pitches.

Among his better known works are the &quot;Variations for Orchestra&quot; (1954–55); the &quot;Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras&quot; (1959–61); the &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; (1964–65), written as an 85th-birthday present for Stravinsky; the &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; (1969), loosely based on a poem by Saint-John Perse; and the &quot;Symphony of Three Orchestras&quot; (1976). He also composed five string quartets, of which the second and third won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1960 and 1973 respectively. Spaced at regular intervals throughout his mature career, they are considered by some to be the most important body of work in that medium since Bartók. &quot;&quot; (1993–96) is his largest orchestral work, complex in structure and featuring contrasting layers of instrumental textures, from delicate wind solos to crashing brass and percussion outbursts.

The Piano Concerto (1964–65) uses the collection of three-note chords for its pitch material; the Third String Quartet (1971) uses all four-note chords; the Concerto for Orchestra (1969) all five-note chords; and &quot;A Symphony of Three Orchestras&quot; uses the collection of six-note chords. Carter also made frequent use of &quot;tonic&quot; 12-note chords. Of particular interest are &quot;all-interval&quot; 12-tone chords, where every interval is represented within adjacent notes of the chord. His 1980 solo piano work &quot;Night Fantasies&quot; uses the entire collection of the 88 symmetrical-inverted all-interval 12-note chords. Typically, the pitch material is segmented between instruments, with a unique set of chords or sets assigned to each instrument or orchestral section. This stratification of material, with individual voices assigned not only their own unique pitch material but texture and rhythm as well, is a key component of Carter&#x27;s style. His music after &quot;Night Fantasies&quot; has been termed his late period and his tonal language became less systematized and more intuitive, but retains the basic characteristics of his earlier works.

Carter&#x27;s use of rhythm can best be understood with the concept of stratification. Each instrumental voice is typically assigned its own set of tempos. A structural polyrhythm, where a very slow polyrhythm is used as a formal device, is present in many of Carter&#x27;s works. &quot;Night Fantasies&quot;, for example, uses a 216:175 tempo relation that coincides at only two points over its 20+ minutes. This use of rhythm was part of his expansion of the notion of counterpoint to encompass simultaneous different characters, even entire movements, rather than just individual lines.

Carter said that the steady pulses of older music reminded him of soldiers marching or horses trotting, sounds no longer heard in the late 20th century, and he wanted his music to capture the sort of continuous acceleration or deceleration experienced in an automobile or an airplane. While Carter&#x27;s music shows little trace of American popular music or jazz, his vocal music has demonstrated strong ties to contemporary American poetry. He set poems by Elizabeth Bishop (&quot;A Mirror on Which to Dwell&quot;), John Ashbery (&quot;Syringa&quot; and &quot;Mad Regales&quot;), Robert Lowell (&quot;In Sleep, in Thunder&quot; and &quot;Mad Regales&quot;), John Hollander (&quot;Of Challenge and of Love&quot;), William Carlos Williams (&quot;Of Rewaking&quot;), Wallace Stevens (&quot;In the Distances of Sleep&quot; and &quot;The American Sublime&quot;), Ezra Pound (&quot;On Conversing with Paradise&quot;), E. E. Cummings (&quot;A Sunbeam&#x27;s Architecture&quot;), Marianne Moore (&quot;What Are Years&quot;) and T. S. Eliot (&quot;Three Explorations&quot;). Twentieth-century poets also inspired several of his large instrumental works, such as the &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; (St. John Perse) and &quot;A Symphony of Three Orchestras&quot; (Hart Crane).

<doc id="246833" wikidata="Q183332" url="?curid=246833" title="Saint Sebastian">
<text>Sebastian (; ) was an early Christian saint and martyr. According to traditional belief, he was killed during the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians. He was initially tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows, though this did not kill him. He was, according to tradition, rescued and healed by Irene of Rome, which became a popular subject in 17th-century painting. In all versions of the story, shortly after his recovery he went to Diocletian to warn him about his sins, and as a result was clubbed to death. He is venerated in the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of athletics, archery, and plagues. Although inconsistent with Catholic Church teaching, many view him as the patron saint of the sports.

The oldest record of the details of Sebastian&#x27;s martyrdom is found in the &quot;Chronograph of 354&quot;, which mentions him as a martyr, venerated on January 20. He is also mentioned in a sermon on Psalm 118 by 4th-century bishop Ambrose of Milan: in his sermon, Ambrose stated that Sebastian came from Milan and that he was already venerated there at that time. The full account of his martyrdom comes from the &quot;Passio Sancti Sebastiani&quot;, a 5th-century text written by an anonymous author, possibly Arnobius the Younger.

Sebastian is a popular male saint, especially today among athletes. In medieval times, he was regarded as a saint with a special ability to intercede to protect from plague, and devotion to him greatly increased when plague was active.

==Life==
There is not much known about Saint Sebastian&#x27;s early life, but the ancient source mentioning Sebastian is found in the &quot;Chronograph of 354&quot;, a compilation of chronological and calendrical texts produced in 354 AD by the calligrapher and illustrator Furius Dionysius Filocalus, which mentions him as a martyr who was venerated on January 20. His cult is also mentioned by Ambrose of Milan in his &quot;Expositio in Psalmum CXVIII&quot;, a theological and exegetical commentary of Psalm 118 dated to 386–390 AD; Ambrose states that Sebastian came from Milan and that he was venerated as a saint there.

The first surviving account of Sebastian&#x27;s life and death is the &quot;Passio Sancti Sebastiani&quot;, long thought to have been written by Ambrose in the 4th century, but now regarded as a 5th-century account by an unknown author (possibly Arnobius the Younger). This includes the &quot;two martyrdoms&quot;, and the care by Irene in between, and other details that remained part of the story.

According to Sebastian&#x27;s 18th-century entry in &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;, still attributed to Ambrose by the 17th-century hagiographer Jean Bolland, and the briefer account in the 14th-century &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot;, he was a man of Gallia Narbonensis who was taught in Mediolanum (Milan). In 283, Sebastian entered the army in Rome under Emperor Carinus to assist the martyrs. Because of his courage he became one of the captains of the Praetorian Guards under Diocletian and Maximian, who were unaware that he was a Christian.

According to tradition, Marcus and Marcellianus were twin brothers from a distinguished family and were deacons. Both brothers married, and they resided in Rome with their wives and children. The brothers refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods and were arrested. They were visited by their parents Tranquillinus and Martia in prison, who attempted to persuade them to renounce Christianity. Sebastian succeeded in converting Tranquillinus and Martia, as well as Tiburtius, the son of Chromatius, the local prefect. Another official, Nicostratus, and his wife Zoe were also converted. It has been said that Zoe had been a mute for six years; however, she made known to Sebastian her desire to be converted to Christianity. As soon as she had, her speech returned to her. Nicostratus then brought the rest of the prisoners; these 16 persons were converted by Sebastian.

Chromatius and Tiburtius converted; Chromatius set all of his prisoners free from jail, resigned his position, and retired to the country in Campania. Marcus and Marcellianus, after being concealed by a Christian named Castulus, were later martyred, as were Nicostratus, Zoe, and Tiburtius.

===Martyrdom===
 
Sebastian had prudently concealed his faith, but in 286 it was detected. Diocletian reproached him for his supposed betrayal, and he commanded him to be led to a field and there to be bound to a stake so that the chosen archers from Mauretania would shoot arrows at him. &quot;And the archers shot at him till he was as full of arrows as an urchin is full of pricks, and thus left him there for dead.&quot; Miraculously, the arrows did not kill him. The widow of Castulus, Irene of Rome, went to retrieve his body to bury it, and discovered he was still alive. She brought him back to her house and nursed him back to health.

Sebastian later stood by a staircase where the emperor was to pass and harangued Diocletian for his cruelties against Christians. This freedom of speech, and from a person whom he supposed to have been dead, greatly astonished the emperor; but recovering from his surprise, he gave orders for Sebastian to be seized and beaten to death with cudgels, and his body thrown into the common sewer. A holy lady named Lucina, admonished by the martyr in a vision, privately removed the body and buried it in the catacombs at the entrance of the cemetery of Calixtus, where now stands the Basilica of St. Sebastian.

===Location of remains===

Remains reputed to be those of Sebastian are housed in Rome in the &quot;Basilica Apostolorum&quot;, built by Pope Damasus I in 367 on the site of the provisional tomb of Saints Peter and Paul. The church, today called San Sebastiano fuori le mura, was rebuilt in the 1610s under the patronage of Scipione Borghese.

Ado, Eginard, Sigebert, and other contemporary authors relate that, in the reign of Louis Debonnair, Pope Eugenius II gave the body of Sebastian to Hilduin, Abbot of St. Denys, who brought it into France, and it was deposited at Saint Medard Abbey, at Soissons, on 8 December, in 826.

Sebastian&#x27;s cranium was brought to the town of Ebersberg (Germany) in 934. A Benedictine abbey was founded there and became one of the most important pilgrimage sites in southern Germany. It is said the silver-encased cranium was used as a cup in which to present the consecrated wine of the Blessed Sacrament to the faithful during the feast of Saint Sebastian.

==As protector against plague==
The belief that Saint Sebastian was a defense against the plague was a medieval addition to his reputation, which largely accounts for the enormous increase in his importance in the Late Middle Ages. The connection of the martyr shot with arrows with the plague is not an intuitive one. However, the hopeful example of Sebastian being able to recover from his &quot;first martyrdom&quot; (or &quot;sagittation&quot;, as it is sometimes called) was relevant as the arrow-wounds can resemble the buboes that were symptoms of bubonic plague. Visually, &quot;the arrow wounds call to God for mercy to us, as the symptoms of the infirm call for pity from the passerby&quot;, as Molanus put it.

The chronicler Paul the Deacon relates that, in 680, Rome was freed from a raging pestilence by him. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; transmits the episode of a great plague that afflicted the Lombards in the time of King Gumburt, which was stopped by the erection of an altar in honor of Sebastian in the Church of Saint Peter in the Province of Pavia.

==In art and literature==
===Art===

The earliest known representation of Sebastian is a mosaic in the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo (Ravenna, Italy) dated between 527 and 565. The right lateral wall of the basilica contains large mosaics representing a procession of 26 martyrs, led by Saint Martin and including Sebastian. The martyrs are represented in Byzantine style, lacking any individuality, and all have identical expressions.

Another early representation is in a mosaic in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, probably made in the year 682. It shows a grown, bearded man in court dress but contains no trace of an arrow. The archers and arrows begin to appear by 1000, and ever since have been far more commonly shown than the actual moment of his death by clubbing, so that there is a popular misperception that this is how he died.

As protector of potential plague victims (a connection popularized by the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;) and soldiers, Sebastian occupied an important place in the popular medieval mind. He was among the most frequently depicted of all saints by Late Gothic and Renaissance artists, in the period after the Black Death. The opportunity to show a semi-nude young male, often in a contorted pose, also made Sebastian a favorite subject. His shooting with arrows was the subject of the largest engraving by the &quot;Master of the Playing Cards&quot; in the 1430s, when there were few other current subjects with male nudes other than Christ. Sebastian appears in many other prints and paintings, although this was due to his popularity with the faithful. Among many others, Botticelli, Perugino, Titian, Pollaiuolo, Giovanni Bellini, Guido Reni (who painted the subject seven times), Mantegna (three times), Hans Memling, Gerrit van Honthorst, Luca Signorelli, El Greco, Honoré Daumier, John Singer Sargent and Louise Bourgeois all painted Saint Sebastians. An early work by the sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini is of Saint Sebastian.

The saint is ordinarily depicted as a handsome youth pierced by arrows. Predella scenes when required often depicted his arrest, confrontation with the Emperor, and final beheading. The illustration in the infobox is the &quot;Saint Sebastian&quot; of Il Sodoma, at the Pitti Palace, Florence.
Hans Holbein the Elder created a statuette of Saint Sebastian &quot;in silver and parcel-gilt&quot;, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

A mainly 17th-century subject, though found in predella scenes as early as the 15th century, was &quot;Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene&quot;, painted by Georges de La Tour, Trophime Bigot (four times), Jusepe de Ribera, Hendrick ter Brugghen (in perhaps his masterpiece) and others. This may have been a deliberate attempt by the Church to get away from the single nude subject, which is already recorded in Vasari as sometimes arousing inappropriate thoughts among churchgoers. The Baroque artists usually treated it as a nocturnal chiaroscuro scene, illuminated by a single candle, torch or lantern, in the style fashionable in the first half of the 17th century. There exist several cycles depicting the life of Sebastian. Among them are the frescos in the basilica church of San Sebastiano, Acireale in Sicily painted by Pietro Paolo Vasta.

Egon Schiele, an Austrian Expressionist artist, painted a self-portrait as Saint Sebastian in 1915.

===Literature, fiction, and music===

In 1911, the Italian playwright Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio in conjunction with Claude Debussy produced &quot;Le Martyre de saint Sébastien&quot;. The American composer Gian Carlo Menotti composed a ballet score for a Ballets Russes production which was first given in 1944. In his novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, Thomas Mann hails the &quot;Sebastian-Figure&quot; as the supreme emblem of Apollonian beauty, that is, the artistry of differentiated forms; beauty as measured by discipline, proportion, and luminous distinctions. This allusion to Sebastian&#x27;s suffering, associated with the writerly professionalism of the novella&#x27;s protagonist, Gustav Aschenbach, provides a model for the &quot;heroism born of weakness&quot;, which characterizes poise amidst agonizing torment and plain acceptance of one&#x27;s fate as, beyond mere patience and passivity, a stylized achievement and artistic triumph.

Sebastian&#x27;s death was depicted in the 1949 film &quot;Fabiola&quot;, in which he was played by Massimo Girotti. In 1976, the British director Derek Jarman made a film, &quot;Sebastiane&quot;, which caused controversy in its treatment of the martyr as a &quot;homosexual icon&quot;, according to a number of critics reflecting a subtext perceptible in the imagery since the Renaissance. Also in 1976, in the American horror film &quot;Carrie&quot;, a figure of Saint Sebastian (commonly misconstrued as a figure of the crucified Christ) appears in Carrie&#x27;s prayer closet.

Boxer Muhammad Ali was pictured in the iconography of a bound Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, in the April 1968 issue of &quot;Esquire Magazine.&quot; The image was created by photographer George Lois and art director Carl Fischer.

A depiction of Saint Sebastian in a fresco restoration in an isolated Italian village is the central motif and cryptic mystery of the 1976 giallo horror film &quot;The House with Laughing Windows&quot;.

In her 1965 story &quot;Everything That Rises Must Converge&quot;, Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s character Julian feels as if he were the martyr while taking his mother to &quot;reducing&quot; classes at the Y.

In 1984 there was a movie adaptation called Das Martyrium des heiligen Sebastian starring Terminator star Michael Biehn. 

In 1997, the eighth episode of the second season of the television series &quot;Millennium&quot;, the protagonists search for the hand of Saint Sebastian.

In 2007, artist Damien Hirst presented Saint Sebastian, Exquisite Pain from his Natural History series. The piece depicts a cow in formaldehyde, bound in metal cable and shot with arrows.

British pop band Alt-J&#x27;s video for &quot;Hunger of the Pine&quot; contains references to the story of Saint Sebastian&#x27;s death, adapted to fit the lyrics of the song. Tarsem Singh&#x27;s video for the R.E.M. song &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; makes use of imagery of Saint Sebastian, drawing particular inspiration from paintings by Guido Reni and Caravaggio. The indie folk band the Mountain Goats have a song called &quot;Hail, St. Sebastian&quot; that makes reference to his life. Scottish musician Momus has a song &quot;Lucky like St Sebastian&quot;, featuring on his 1986 debut album &quot;Circus Maximus.&quot;

Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m a Sinner&quot; from her 2012 album &quot;MDNA&quot; has a segment resembling a litany, with one line saying, &quot;St. Sebastian, don&#x27;t you cry; let those poisoned arrows fly.&quot;

The 2013–2018 Canadian drama series &quot;Forgive Me&quot; centres on a priest haunted by recurring visions of Saint Sebastian.

The look of the character Gemino in the popular action-platform videogame &quot;Blasphemous&quot; is clearly inspired by Saint Sebastian.

The family del Valle in Isabel Allende&#x27;s novel &quot;House of the Spirits&quot; attends Sunday mass in the Church of Saint Sebastian.

==Patronage==
In the Catholic Church, Sebastian is commemorated by an optional memorial on 20 January. In the Church of Greece, Sebastian&#x27;s feast day is on 18 December.

As a protector from the bubonic plague, Sebastian was formerly one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In Catholicism, Sebastian is the patron saint of archers, pin-makers, athletes (a modern association) and of a holy death.
Sebastian is one of the patron saints of the city of Qormi in Malta Sebastian is the patron saint of Acireale, Caserta and Petilia Policastro in Italy, Melilli in Sicily, and San Sebastián as well as Palma de Mallorca, Lubrín and Huelva in Spain. He is the patron saint of Negombo, Sri Lanka and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Informally, in the tradition of the Afro-Brazilian syncretic religion Umbanda, Sebastian is often associated with Oxossi, especially in the state of Rio de Janeiro itself.
In Lubrín, every year on 20 January, there is a festival in honor of Saint Sebastian. A statue of Saint Sebastian leads a procession around the village, and people hurl bread rolls from their balconies to the crowds following the saint in the streets below. The rolls have a hole in the middle and some people string them on a rope around their body. The festival is thought to have originated in the 14th century, after a plague of cholera hit the area. At this time, the wealthy were said to have thrown bread and money to the poor on the streets below, so as to avoid catching the disease. The San Sebastian &#x27;bread festival&#x27; is so unusual that it has been declared a Fiesta of National Tourist Interest in Andalusia.

King Sebastian I of Portugal, the only King to ever have this name, was so named for having been born on this saint&#x27;s feast day.

The Feast of St. Sebastian is celebrated among Catholic communities of Kerala in India. Churches are illuminated and decorated, with fireworks being a main event in Catholic homes to commemorate the saint. Every parish has its own date of celebration, especially in the districts of Thrissur, Ernakulam, St. Andrew&#x27;s Basilica, Arthunkal and Kottayam. In Kanjoor Syro Malabar Church the feast is celebrated with the largest procession of golden crosses and decorated umbrellas in Asia. Besides this, many pilgrim centres, churches, shrines and many educational institutions too, throughout Kerala, bear the name of the saint.

He is the patron of San Sebastian College – Recoletos in Manila, Philippines, which is adjacent to the Minor Basilica of San Sebastian, the all-steel church in the Philippines and in Asia administered by the Order of Augustinian Recollect (OAR). At the Catholic Newman Community at the University of Rochester, the St. Sebastian Society is an organization of campus-wide Christian athletes that works to serve the greater Rochester, New York, area through methods of restorative justice, special needs fundraising and community service.

Sebastian is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bacolod, in Negros Occidental, Philippines and Lipa City in Batangas, Philippines. Also, Sebastian is the patron saint of Leon City Mexico. A representation of the Saint in his martyrdom is present in the upper left corner of the city coat of arms.

Sebastian is the patron of Knights of Columbus Council #4926 in the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California, serving the cities of Mountain View and Los Altos. Sebastian is the patron saint of the Catholic War Veterans of the United States of America. The highest award given by the CWV is the Honor Legion of the Order of St. Sebastian.

In his 1906 &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, Carl Schurz recalls the annual &quot;bird shoot&quot; pageant of the Rhenish town of Liblar (de), sponsored by the Saint Sebastian Society, a club of sharpshooters and their sponsors to which nearly every adult member of the town belonged.

The St. Sebastian River in the American state of Florida is named after him. The river is a tributary of the Indian River Lagoon and comprises part of the boundary between Indian River County and Brevard County. The adjacent city of Sebastian, Florida, and St. Sebastian River Preserve State Park are also named for Saint Sebastian. Within the Diocese of Central Florida, the nearby Episcopal Church on Melbourne Beaches is named St Sebastian-by-the-Sea.

==LGBTQ association==
In 1996, American author Richard A. Kaye wrote that &quot;Contemporary gay men have seen in Sebastian at once a stunning advertisement for homosexual desire (indeed, a homoerotic ideal), and a prototypical portrait of tortured closet case.&quot;

Some religious images depicting Saint Sebastian have been adopted by the LGBTQ community. A combination of his strong, shirtless physique, the symbolism of the arrows penetrating his body, and the countenance of rapturous pain have intrigued artists (gay or otherwise) for centuries. 

Oscar Wilde was known to have adored Guido Reni&#x27;s &quot;Saint Sebastian&quot;, which is in the collection of the Palazzo Rosso, in Genoa. While exiled in Paris, Wilde went so far as to adopt the alias Sebastian Melmoth during the remaining years of his life. Other homosexual poets and artists like Federico García Lorca or Pier Paolo Pasolini highlighted the importance of Saint Sebastian imagery in their work.

In Yukio Mishima&#x27;s novel &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot;, the protagonist Kochan has his first gay sexual experience while looking at a reproduction of Guido Reni&#x27;s &quot;Saint Sebastian&quot;. Kochan remarks:

This references Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s belief that gay men have an inclination towards certain artistic subjects including Saint Sebastian.

<doc id="246843" wikidata="Q174432" url="?curid=246843" title="Pedro Álvares Cabral">
<text>Pedro Álvares Cabral (; born Pedro Álvares de Gouveia; ) was a Portuguese nobleman, military commander, navigator and explorer regarded as the European discoverer of Brazil. He was the first human in history to ever be on four continents, uniting all of them in his famous voyage of 1500, where he also conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of South America and claimed it for Portugal. While details of Cabral&#x27;s early life remain unclear, it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education. He was appointed to head an expedition to India in 1500, following Vasco da Gama&#x27;s newly opened route around Africa. The undertaking had the aim of returning with valuable spices and of establishing trade relations in India—bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of Arab, Turkish and Italian merchants. Although the previous expedition of Vasco da Gama to India, on its sea route, had recorded signs of land west of the southern Atlantic Ocean (in 1497), Cabral led the first known expedition to have touched four continents: Europe, Africa, America, and Asia.

His fleet of 13 ships sailed far into the western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, and made landfall (April 1500) on what he initially assumed to be a large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later came to be known as Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.

A storm in the southern Atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the Mozambique Channel before proceeding to Calicut in India. Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but Arab merchants saw Portugal&#x27;s venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese entrepôt. The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed. Cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack. From Calicut the expedition sailed to the Kingdom of Cochin, another Indian city-state, where Cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe. Despite the loss of human lives and ships, Cabral&#x27;s voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal. The extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown&#x27;s finances and helped lay the foundation of a Portuguese Empire that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East.

Cabral was later passed over, possibly as a result of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil&#x27;s independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral&#x27;s reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil&#x27;s discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, historians consider Cabral to be a major figure of the Age of Discovery.

== Early life ==

Little is certain regarding Pedro Álvares Cabral&#x27;s life before, or following, his voyage which led to the discovery of Brazil. He was born in 1467 or 1468—the former year being the more likely—at Belmonte, about from present-day Covilhã in central Portugal. He was a son of Fernão Álvares Cabral and Isabel Gouveia—one of five boys and six girls in the family. Cabral was christened Pedro Álvares de Gouveia and only later, supposedly upon his elder brother&#x27;s death in 1503, did he begin using his father&#x27;s surname. The coat of arms of his family was drawn with two purple goats on a field of silver. Purple represented fidelity, and the goats were derived from the family name (&quot;cabral&quot; pertains to &quot;goats&quot; in English). However, only his elder brother was entitled to make use of the family arms.

Family lore said that the &quot;Cabrais&quot; were descendants of Caranus, the legendary first king of Macedonia. Caranus was, in turn, a supposed 7th-generation scion of the demigod Hercules. Myths aside, the historian James McClymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to the true origin of Cabral&#x27;s family. According to that tradition, the &quot;Cabrais&quot; derive from a Castilian clan named the &quot;Cabreiras&quot; (&quot;cabra&quot; is Spanish [and Portuguese] for goat) who bore a similar coat of arms. The Cabral family rose to prominence during the 14th century. Álvaro Gil Cabral (Cabral&#x27;s great-great-grandfather and a frontier military commander) was one of the few Portuguese nobles to remain loyal to Dom João I, King of Portugal during the war against the King of Castile. As a reward, João I presented Álvaro Gil with the hereditary fiefdom of Belmonte.

Raised as a member of the lower nobility, Cabral was sent to the court of King Dom Afonso V in 1479 at around age 12. He received an education in the humanities and learned to bear arms and fight. He would have been roughly age 17 on 30 June 1484 when he was named &quot;moço fidalgo&quot; (young nobleman; a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles) by King Dom João II. Records of his deeds prior to 1500 are extremely fragmentary, but Cabral may have campaigned in North Africa, as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his day. King Dom Manuel I, who had acceded to the throne two years previously, awarded him an annual allowance worth 30,000 &quot;reais&quot; on 12 April 1497. He was concurrently given the title &quot;Fidalgo&quot; (nobleman) in the King&#x27;s Council and was named a Knight of the Order of Christ. There is no contemporary image or detailed physical description of Cabral. It is known that he had a strong build and matched his father&#x27;s height of . Cabral&#x27;s character has been described as well-learned, courteous, prudent, generous, tolerant with enemies, humble, but also vain and too concerned with the respect he felt his honor and position demanded.

== Discovery of Brazil ==
=== Fleet commander-in-chief ===

On 15 February 1500, Cabral was appointed &quot;Capitão-mor&quot; (literally Major-Captain, or commander-in-chief) of a fleet sailing for India. It was then the custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence. This was the case for the captains of the ships under Cabral&#x27;s command—most were nobles like himself. The practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as Afonso de Albuquerque or Dom João de Castro.

Scant details have survived regarding the criteria used by the Portuguese government in its selection of Cabral as head of the India expedition. In the royal decree naming him commander-in-chief, the only reasons given are &quot;merits and services&quot;. Nothing more is known about these qualifications. Historian William Greenlee argued that King Manuel I &quot;had undoubtedly known him well at court&quot;. That, along with the &quot;standing of the Cabral family, their unquestioned loyalty to the Crown, the personal appearance of Cabral, and the ability which he had shown at court and in the council were important factors&quot;. Also in his favor may have been the influence of two of his brothers who sat on the King&#x27;s Council. Given the political intrigue present at court, Cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his appointment. The historian Malyn Newitt subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that the choice of Cabral &quot;was a deliberate attempt to balance the interests of rival factions of noble families, for he appears to have no other quality to recommend him and no known experience in commanding major expeditions.&quot;

Cabral became the military chief, while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval matters. The most important of these were Bartolomeu Dias, Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho. They would, along with the other captains, command 13 ships and 1,500 men. Of this contingent, 700 were soldiers, although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in combat.

The fleet had two divisions. The first division was composed of nine &quot;naus&quot; (carracks) and two round caravels, and was headed to Calicut in India with the goal of establishing trade relations and a factory. The second division, consisting of one &quot;nau&quot; and one round caravel, set sail for the port of Sofala in what is today Mozambique. In exchange for leading the fleet, Cabral was entitled to 10,000 &quot;cruzados&quot; (an old Portuguese currency equivalent to approximately 35 kg of gold) and the right to purchase of pepper at his own expense for transport back to Europe. The pepper could then be resold, tax-free, to the Portuguese Crown. He was also allowed to import 10 boxes of any other kind of spice, duty-free. Although the voyage was extremely hazardous, Cabral had the prospect of becoming a very rich man if he returned safely to Portugal with the cargo. Spices were then rare in Europe and keenly sought-after.

An earlier fleet had been the first to reach India by circumnavigating Africa. That expedition had been led by Vasco da Gama and returned to Portugal in 1499. For decades Portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the East, in order to bypass the Mediterranean Sea which was under the control of the Italian Maritime Republics and the Ottoman Empire. Portugal&#x27;s expansionism would lead first to a route to India, and later to worldwide colonization. A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration. There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims, which stemmed from Portugal&#x27;s fight for nationhood against the Moors. The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent. An additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical Prester John—a powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged. Finally, the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade of slaves and gold, and India&#x27;s spice trade.

=== Departure and arrival in a new land ===
The fleet under the command of the 32-year-old Cabral departed from Lisbon on 9 March 1500 at noon. The previous day it had been given a public send-off which included a Mass and celebrations attended by the King, his court and a huge crowd. On the morning of 14 March, the flotilla passed Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands. It sailed onward to Cape Verde, a Portuguese colony situated on the West African coast, which was reached on 22 March. The next day, a &quot;nau&quot; commanded by Vasco de Ataíde with 150 men disappeared without a trace. The fleet crossed the Equator on 9 April, and sailed westward as far as possible from the African continent in what was known as the &quot;volta do mar&quot; (literally &quot;turn of the sea&quot;) navigational technique. Seaweed was sighted on 21 April, which led the sailors to believe that they were nearing the coast. They were proven correct the next afternoon, Wednesday 22 April 1500, when the fleet anchored near what Cabral christened the Monte Pascoal (&quot;Easter Mount&quot;, it being the week of Easter). The spot is on the eastern coast of present-day Brazil.

The Portuguese detected inhabitants on the shore, and all ships&#x27; captains gathered aboard Cabral&#x27;s lead ship on 23 April. Cabral ordered Nicolau Coelho, a captain who had experience from Vasco da Gama&#x27;s voyage to India, to go ashore and make contact. He set foot on land and exchanged gifts with the indigenous people. After Coelho returned, Cabral took the fleet north, where after traveling along the coast, it anchored on 24 April in what the commander-in-chief named &quot;Porto Seguro&quot; (Safe Port). The place was a natural harbor, and Afonso Lopes (pilot of the lead ship) brought two natives aboard to confer with Cabral.

As in the first contact, the meeting was friendly and Cabral presented the locals with gifts. The inhabitants were Stone Age hunter-gatherers, to whom the Europeans had assigned the collective label &quot;Indians&quot;. The men collected food by stalking game, fishing and foraging, while the women engaged in small-scale farming. They were divided into countless rival tribes. The tribe which Cabral met was the Tupiniquim. Some of these groups were nomadic and others sedentary—having a knowledge of fire but not metalworking. A few tribes engaged in cannibalism. On 26 April, as more and more curious and friendly natives appeared, Cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a Christian Mass was held—the first celebrated on the soil of what would later become Brazil. He, along with the ships&#x27; crews, participated.

The following days were spent stockpiling water, food, wood, and other provisions. The Portuguese also built a massive—perhaps long—wooden cross. Cabral ascertained that the new land lay east of the demarcation line between Portugal and Spain that had been specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas. The territory was thus within the sphere allotted to Portugal. To solemnize Portugal&#x27;s claim to the land, the wooden cross was erected and a second religious service was held on 1 May. In honor of the cross, Cabral named the newly discovered land &quot;Ilha de Vera Cruz&quot; (Island of the True Cross). The next day a supply ship under the command of either Gaspar de Lemos or André Gonçalves (the sources conflict on who was sent) returned to Portugal to apprise the King of the discovery.

== Voyage to India ==
=== Tragedy of Southern Africa ===
The fleet resumed its voyage on either 2 or 3 May 1500 and sailed along the east coast of South America. Cabral became convinced that he had found an entire continent, rather than an island. Around 5 May, the fleet veered eastwards towards Africa. On 23 or 24 May they encountered a storm in the South Atlantic&#x27;s high-pressure zone, resulting in the loss of four ships. The exact location of the disaster is unknown—speculations range from near the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of the African continent to &quot;within sight of the South American coast&quot;. Three &quot;naus&quot; and a caravel commanded by Bartolomeu Dias—the first European to reach the Cape of Good Hope in 1488—foundered, and 380 men were lost.

The remaining vessels, hindered by rough weather and damaged rigging, were separated. One ship that had been separated, commanded by Diogo Dias, wandered onward alone, and the other six ships were able to regroup. They gathered into two formations consisting of three ships each, and Cabral&#x27;s group sailed east, past the Cape of Good Hope. Fixing their position and sighting land, they turned north and landed somewhere in the Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago, off East Africa and north of Sofala. The main fleet remained near Sofala ten days undergoing repairs. The expedition then went north, and on 26 May reached Kilwa Kisiwani, where Cabral made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a treaty with its king.

From Kilwa Kisiwani, the fleet departed to Malindi, which was reached on 2 August. Cabral met with its king, with whom he established friendly relations and exchanged gifts. Pilots were recruited at Malindi for the last leg to India and the fleet set sail. Land was reached at Anjadip, an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies on their way to Calicut. Here the ships were beached, recaulked and painted. Final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of Calicut.

=== Massacre in Calicut ===
The fleet departed Anjadip and arrived in Calicut on 13 September. Cabral successfully negotiated with the Zamorin (the title of the ruler of Calicut) and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse. In hopes of further improving relations, Cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the Zamorin&#x27;s request. However, on 16 or 17 December, the factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300 (according to other accounts, perhaps as many as several thousand) Arabs and Indians. Despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen, more than 50 Portuguese were killed. The remaining defenders retreated to the ships, some by swimming. Thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous Arab merchants, Cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from the ruler of Calicut, but no apology was forthcoming.

The Portuguese were outraged by the attack on the factory and the death of their comrades and seized ten Arab merchant ships at anchor in the harbor. Around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire. Cabral also ordered his ships to bombard Calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement. The massacre was blamed in part on Portuguese animosity towards Muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the Moors on the Iberian peninsula and in North Africa. Moreover, the Portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish. The Arabs also had no desire to allow the Portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices. The Portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade. The letter from King Manuel I brought by Cabral to the ruler of Calicut, which was translated by the ruler&#x27;s Arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of Arab traders. The Arab merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods, and attempted to sway the Zamorin against the Portuguese. The Portuguese and Arabs were extremely suspicious of each other&#x27;s every action.

Historian William Greenlee has argued that the Portuguese realized that &quot;they were few in numbers and that those who would come to India in the future fleets would always be at a numerical disadvantage; so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that the Portuguese would be feared and respected in the future. It was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end.&quot; Thus, they created a precedent for the gunboat diplomacy used by European powers in Asia during the following centuries.

=== Return to Europe ===
Warnings in reports from Vasco da Gama&#x27;s voyage to India had prompted King Manuel I to brief Cabral regarding another port to the south of Calicut where he could also trade. This city was Cochin and the fleet set sail, reaching it on 24 December. Cochin was nominally a vassal of Calicut, as well as being dominated by other Indian cities. Cochin was eager to achieve independence, and the Portuguese were willing to exploit Indian disunity to further their own goals. This tactic eventually ensured Portuguese hegemony over the region. Cabral forged an alliance with Cochin&#x27;s ruler, as well as with rulers of other Indian cities, and was able to establish a factory. At last, loaded with precious spices, the fleet went to Kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to Portugal on 16 January 1501.

The expedition headed for the east coast of Africa. One of the ships became stranded on a sandbar and the vessel began to founder. As there was no space in the other ships, its cargo was lost and Cabral ordered the carrack to be set on fire. The fleet then proceeded to the Island of Mozambique (northeast of Sofala), in order to take on provisions and make the ships ready for the rough passage around the Cape of Good Hope. One caravel was sent to Sofala—another of the expedition&#x27;s goals. A second caravel, considered the fastest ship in the fleet and captained by Nicolau Coelho, was sent ahead to give the King advance notice of the voyage&#x27;s success. A third vessel, commanded by Pedro de Ataíde, became separated from the fleet after leaving Mozambique.

On 22 May, the fleet—now reduced to only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho&#x27;s caravel but also the &quot;nau&quot; captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost for over a year following the disaster in the South Atlantic. The &quot;nau&quot; had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades. Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.

Nicolau Coelho&#x27;s caravel departed first from Beseguiche and arrived in Portugal on 23 June 1501. Cabral stayed behind, waiting for Pedro de Ataíde&#x27;s missing ship and for the caravel that had been sent to Sofala. Both eventually appeared and Cabral arrived in Portugal on 21 July 1501, with the other vessels coming home during the following days. In all, two ships returned empty, five were fully loaded and six were lost. Nonetheless, the cargoes carried by the fleet returned up to 800% profit to the Portuguese Crown. Once sold, the proceeds covered the outlay in equipping the fleet, covered the cost of the vessels which had been lost, and cleared a profit which itself exceeded the total sum of those costs. &quot;Undeterred by the unprecedented losses which he had sustained&quot;, asserts historian James McClymont, when Cabral &quot;reached the East African coast, pressed forward to the accomplishment of the task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire the surviving officers and men with like courage.&quot; &quot;Few voyages to Brazil and India were so well executed as Cabral&#x27;s&quot;, affirmed historian Bailey Diffie, which laid down a path leading to the immediate commencement &quot;of a Portuguese seagoing empire from Africa to the far East&quot;, and eventually to &quot;a land empire in Brazil&quot;.

== Later years and death ==

Upon Cabral&#x27;s return, King Manuel I began planning another fleet to make the journey to India and to avenge the Portuguese losses in Calicut. Cabral was selected to command this &quot;Revenge Fleet&quot;, as it was called. For eight months Cabral made all preparations, but for reasons which remain uncertain, he was relieved of command. It had apparently been proposed to give another navigator, Vicente Sodré, independent command over a section of the fleet, and Cabral strongly opposed this. Whether he was dismissed or requested himself that he be relieved of command, the result was that when the fleet departed in March 1502, its commander was Vasco da Gama—a maternal nephew of Vicente Sodré—and not Cabral. It is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da Gama and another supporting Cabral. At some point, Cabral left the court permanently. The King was greatly irritated by the feud, to such an extent that mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment, as it did for one of da Gama&#x27;s supporters.

Despite the loss of favor with Manuel I, Cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in 1503 to &quot;Dona&quot; (Lady) Isabel de Castro, a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of King Dom Fernando I of Portugal. Her mother was a sister of Afonso de Albuquerque, one of the greatest Portuguese military leaders during the Age of Discovery. The couple had at least four children: two boys (Fernão Álvares Cabral and António Cabral) and two girls (Catarina de Castro and Guiomar de Castro). There were two additional daughters named Isabel and Leonor according to other sources, which also say that Guiomar, Isabel and Leonor joined religious orders. Afonso de Albuquerque attempted to intercede on Cabral&#x27;s behalf and on 2 December 1514 asked Manuel I to forgive him and allow his return to court, but to no avail.

Suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor (possibly malaria) since his voyage, Cabral withdrew to Santarém in 1509. He spent his remaining years there. Only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time. According to a royal letter dated 17 December 1509, Cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him. Another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for undisclosed military service. In 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from &quot;fidalgo&quot; to knight in the King&#x27;s Council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437 &quot;reais&quot;. This was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid. Cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. He was buried in the São João Evangelista chapel of the Convento da Graça in Santarém.

=== Posthumous rehabilitation ===

The first permanent Portuguese settlement in the land which would become Brazil was São Vicente, which was established in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa. As the years passed, the Portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous Americans and the Spanish. Brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by Portugal as the most important part of its far-flung maritime Empire. On 7 September 1822, the heir of Portuguese King Dom João VI secured the independence of Brazil from Portugal and, as Dom Pedro I, became its first Emperor.

Cabral&#x27;s discovery, and even his resting place in the land of his birth, had been almost completely forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition. This began to change beginning in the 1840s when Emperor Dom Pedro II, successor and son of Pedro I, sponsored research and publications dealing with Cabral&#x27;s life and expedition through the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. This was part of the Emperor&#x27;s ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among Brazil&#x27;s diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique Portuguese-speaking empire, surrounded by Hispanic-American Republics. The initial resurgence of interest in Cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his resting place by the Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen (later Viscount of Porto Seguro). The completely neglected state in which Cabral&#x27;s tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Brazil and Portugal—the latter then ruled by Pedro II&#x27;s eldest sister, Maria II.

In 1871, the Brazilian Emperor—then on a trip to Europe—visited Cabral&#x27;s gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study, which was carried out in 1882. In a second exhumation in 1896, an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed. Although his remains still lay in Portugal, the urn was eventually brought to the old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on 30 December 1903. Cabral has since become a national hero in Brazil. In Portugal, however, he has been much overshadowed by his rival Vasco da Gama. Historian William Greenlee argued that Cabral&#x27;s exploration is important &quot;not only because of its position in the history of geography but because of its influence on the history and economics of the period.&quot; Though he acknowledges that few voyages have &quot;been of greater importance to posterity&quot;, he also says that &quot;few have been less appreciated in their time.&quot; Nevertheless, historian James McClymont affirmed that &quot;Cabral&#x27;s position in the history of Portuguese conquest and discovery is inexpungable despite the supremacy of greater or more fortunate men.&quot; He concluded that Cabral &quot;will always be remembered in history as the chief, if not the first discoverer of Brazil.&quot;

=== Intentional discovery hypothesis ===
A controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether Cabral&#x27;s discovery was by chance or intentional. The latter would mean that the Portuguese at least suspected that land existed to the west. The question was first broached by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.

Until the 1854 conference, the widespread presumption was that the discovery had been an accident. Early works on the subject supported this view, including &quot;História do Descobrimento e Conquista da Índia&quot; (&quot;History of the Discovery and Conquest of India&quot;, published in 1541) by Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, &quot;Décadas da Ásia&quot; (&quot;Decades of Asia&quot;, 1552) by João de Barros, &quot;Crônicas do Felicíssimo Rei D. Manuel&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of the most fortunate D. Manuel&quot;, 1558) by Damião de Góis, &quot;Lendas da Índia&quot; (&quot;Legends of India&quot;, 1561) by Gaspar Correia, &quot;História do Brasil&quot; (&quot;History of Brazil&quot;, 1627) by friar Vicente do Salvador and &quot;História da América Portuguesa&quot; (&quot;History of Portuguese America&quot;, 1730) by Sebastião da Rocha Pita.

The first work to advocate the idea of intentionality was published in 1854 by Joaquim Noberto de Sousa e Silva, after Pedro II had opened the debate. Since then, several scholars have subscribed to that view, including Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Capistrano de Abreu, Pedro Calmon, Fábio Ramos and Mário Barata. Historian Hélio Vianna affirmed that &quot;although there are signs of the intentionality&quot; in Cabral&#x27;s discovery, &quot;based mainly in the knowledge or previous suspicion of the existence of lands at the edge of the South Atlantic&quot;, there are no irrefutable proofs to support it. This opinion is also shared by historian Thomas Skidmore. The debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered &quot;irrelevant&quot; by historian Charles R. Boxer. Historian Anthony Smith concludes that the conflicting contentions will &quot;probably never be resolved&quot;.

=== Forerunners ===
Cabral was not the first European to stumble upon areas of present-day Brazil, not to mention other parts of South America. Norsemen reached North America and even established settlements, although these ended in failure sometime before the end of the 15th century. Christopher Columbus, on his third voyage to the New World in 1498, traveled along part of what would later become Venezuela.

In the case of Brazil, it was once considered probable that the Portuguese navigator Duarte Pacheco Pereira had made a voyage to the Brazilian coast in 1498. This belief has since been dismissed, however, and it is now thought that he voyaged to North America instead. There is more certain evidence that two Spaniards, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and , traveled along the northern coast of Brazil between January and March 1500. Pinzón went from what is today Cabo de Santo Agostinho (Brazilian state of Pernambuco) to the mouth of the Amazon River. There he encountered another Spanish expedition led by Lepe, which would reach as far as the Oyapock River in March. The reason Cabral is credited with having discovered Brazil, rather than the Spanish explorers, is because the visits by Pinzón and Lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact. Historians Capistrano de Abreu, Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Mário Barata and Hélio Vianna concur that the Spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas—with a unique history, culture and society which sets it apart from the Hispanic-American societies which dominate the rest of the continent.

<doc id="246845" wikidata="Q244380" url="?curid=246845" title="Denis of Paris">
<text>Denis of Paris (Latin: Dionysius) was a 3rd-century Christian martyr and saint. According to his hagiographies, he was bishop of Paris (then Lutetia) in the third century and, together with his companions Rusticus and Eleutherius, was martyred for his faith by decapitation. Some accounts placed this during Domitian&#x27;s persecution and incorrectly identified StDenis of Paris with the Areopagite who was converted by Paul the Apostle and who served as the first bishop of Athens. Assuming Denis&#x27;s historicity, it is now considered more likely that he suffered under the persecution of the emperor Decius shortly after AD250.

Denis is the most famous cephalophore in Christian history, with a popular story claiming that the decapitated bishop picked up his head and walked several miles while preaching a sermon on repentance. He is venerated in the Catholic Church as a patron saint of both France and Paris and is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. A chapel was raised at the site of his burial by a local Christian woman; it was later expanded into an abbey and basilica, around which grew up the French city of Saint-Denis, now a suburb of Paris.

==Name==
The medieval and modern French masculine given name Denis derives from the Latin name Dionysius from Greek Dionysios.

==Life==

Gregory of Tours states that Denis was bishop of the Parisii and was martyred by being beheaded by a sword. The earliest document giving an account of his life and martyrdom, the &quot;Passio SS. Dionysii Rustici et Eleutherii&quot;, dates from c. 600, is mistakenly attributed to the poet Venantius Fortunatus, and is legendary. Nevertheless, it appears from the &quot;Passio&quot; that Denis was sent from Italia to convert Gaul in the third century, forging a link with the &quot;apostles to the Gauls&quot; reputed to have been sent out with six other missionary bishops under the direction of Pope Fabian. There Denis was appointed first Bishop of Paris. The persecutions under Emperor Decius had all but dissolved the small Christian community at Lutetia (Paris). Denis, with his inseparable companions Rusticus and Eleutherius, who were martyred with him, settled on the Île de la Cité in the River Seine. Roman Paris lay on the higher ground of the Left Bank, away from the river.

===Martyrdom===
Denis and his companions were so effective in converting people that the pagan priests became alarmed over their loss of followers. At their instigation, the Roman Governor arrested the missionaries. After a long imprisonment, Denis and two of his clergy were executed by beheading on the highest hill in Paris (now Montmartre), which was likely to have been a druidic holy place. The martyrdom of Denis and his companions is popularly believed to have given the site its current name, derived from the Latin &quot;Mons Martyrum&quot; &quot;The Martyrs&#x27; Mountain&quot;, although the name is possibly derived from &quot;Mons Mercurii et Mons Martis&quot;, &quot;Hill of Mercury and Mars&quot;. After his head was cut off, Denis is said to have picked it up and walked several miles from the summit of the hill, preaching a sermon the entire way, making him one of many cephalophores in hagiology. Of the many accounts of this martyrdom, this is noted in detail in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; and in Butler&#x27;s &quot;Lives Of The Saints&quot;. The site where he stopped preaching and actually died was marked by a small shrine that developed into the Basilica of Saint-Denis, which became the burial place for the kings of France. Another account has his corpse being thrown into the Seine, but recovered and buried later that night by his converts.
==Veneration==
Veneration of Denis began soon after his death. The bodies of Denis, Eleutherius, and Rusticus were buried on the spot of their martyrdom, where the construction of the basilica was begun by Genevieve, assisted by the people of Paris. Her &quot;Vita Sanctae Genovefae&quot; attests the presence of a shrine near the present basilica by the close of the fifth century.

Dagobert I, great-grandson of Chlothar I, had the first Royal Basilica built. The Merovingian tradition was, originally, to bury kings such as Clovis and Chlothildis in Paris at Abbey St-Genevieve/Genovefa, as Clovis had ordered its construction in 502 AD. Yet Chilperic I had his own mother, Dowager Queen Aregunda, buried at Saint-Denis. His grandson was clearly following a family tradition. Aregunda&#x27;s (death about 580 AD) tomb was discovered in 1959, and her burial items can be seen at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye museum. A successor church was erected by Fulrad, who became abbot in 749/50 and was closely linked with the accession of the Carolingians to the Merovingian throne.

In time, StDenis came to be regarded as the patron saint of the French people, with StLouis the patron of the monarchy and royal dynasties. &quot;Saint Denis&quot; or &quot;Montjoie! Saint Denis!&quot; became the typical war-cry of the French armies. The oriflamme, which became the standard of France, was the banner consecrated upon his tomb. His veneration spread beyond France when, in 754, Pope Stephen II brought the veneration of Saint Denis to Rome. Soon his &quot;cultus&quot; was prevalent throughout Europe. Abbot Suger removed the relics of Denis, and those associated with Rustique and Eleuthére, from the crypt, to reside under the high altar of the Saint-Denis he rebuilt, 1140–44.

In traditional Catholic practice, Saint Denis is honoured as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. Specifically, Denis is invoked against diabolical possession and headaches and with Geneviève is one of the patron saints of Paris.

==Feast==
9 October is celebrated as the feast of Saint Denis and companions, a priest named Rusticus and a deacon, Eleutherius, who were martyred alongside him and buried with him. The names Rusticus and Eleutherius are non-historical. The feast of Saint Denis was added to the Roman Calendar in the year 1568 by Pope Pius V, although it had been celebrated since at least the year 800.

Saint Denis is also remembered with a commemoration in many Anglican Provinces, including the Church of England and the Anglican Church of Canada, on October 9.

==Confusion with Dionysius the Areopagite==
Since at least the ninth century, the legends of Dionysius the Areopagite and Denis of Paris have often been confused. Around 814, Louis the Pious brought certain writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite to France, and since then it became common among the French legendary writers to argue that Denis of Paris was the same Dionysius who was a famous convert and disciple of Paul of Tarsus. The confusion of the personalities of Denis of Paris, Dionysius the Areopagite, and pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the author of the writings ascribed to Dionysius brought to France by Louis, was initiated through an &quot;Areopagitica&quot; written in 836 by Abbot Hilduin of Saint-Denis at the request of Louis the Pious. &quot;Hilduin was anxious to promote the dignity of his church, and it is to him that the quite unfounded identification of the patron saint with Dionysius the Areopagite and his consequent connexion with the apostolic age are due.&quot; Hilduin&#x27;s attribution had been supported for centuries by the monastic community at Abbey of Saint-Denis and it was one of the origins of their pride. In &quot;Historia calamitatum&quot;, Pierre Abelard gives a short account of the strength of this belief and the monastery&#x27;s harsh opposition to challenges to their claim. Abelard jokingly pointed out a possibility that the founder of the Abbey could have been another Dionysius, who is mentioned as Dionysius of Corinth by Eusebius. This irritated the community so much that eventually Abelard left in bitterness. As late as the sixteenth century, scholars might still argue for an Eastern origin of the Basilica of Saint-Denis: one was Godefroi Tillman, in a long preface to a paraphrase of the &quot;Letters&quot; of the Areopagite, printed in Paris in 1538 by Charlotte Guillard. Most historiographers agree that this conflated legend is completely erroneous.

==Depiction in art==

Denis&#x27; headless walk has led to his being depicted in art decapitated and dressed as a bishop, holding his own (often mitred) head in his hands. Handling the halo in this circumstance poses a unique challenge for the artist. Some put the halo where the head used to be; others have Saint Denis carrying the halo along with the head. Even more problematic than the halo was the issue of how much of his head Denis should be shown carrying.

Throughout much of the Middle Ages, the Abbey of St Denis and the canons of Notre-Dame Cathedral were in dispute over ownership of the saint&#x27;s head. The Abbey claimed that they had the entire body, whilst the Cathedral claimed to possess the top of his head which, they claimed, had been severed by the executioner&#x27;s first blow. Thus while most depictions of St Denis show him holding his entire head, in others, the patrons have shown their support for the cathedral&#x27;s claim by depicting him carrying just the crown of his skull, for example in the mid 13th-century window showing the story at Le Mans Cathedral (Bay 111).

A 1317 illustrated manuscript depicting &quot;The Life of Saint Denis&quot;, once owned by King Philip V of France, is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. It was given to the king by his chaplain Gilles, the abbot of Saint-Denis, having been commissioned by Jean de Pontoise, the previous Abbot of Saint-Denis. The manuscript contains seventy-seven miniatures illustrating the life and martyrdom of Saint Denis.
