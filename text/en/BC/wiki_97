<text>The Boomtown Rats are an Irish rock/new wave band originally formed in Dublin in 1975. Between 1977 and 1985, they had a series of Irish and UK hits including &quot;Like Clockwork&quot;, &quot;Rat Trap&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; and &quot;Banana Republic&quot;. The original line-up comprised six musicians; five from Dún Laoghaire in County Dublin; Gerry Cott (rhythm guitar), Simon Crowe (drums), Johnnie Fingers (keyboards), Bob Geldof (vocals) and Garry Roberts (lead guitar), plus Fingers&#x27; cousin Pete Briquette (bass). The Boomtown Rats broke up in 1986, but reformed in 2013, without Fingers or Cott. Garry Roberts died in 2022. The band&#x27;s fame and notability have been overshadowed by the charity work of frontman Bob Geldof, a former journalist with the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The band was formed in 1975 with five of the six members who came from Dún Laoghaire, while Pete Briquette was originally from Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan, Ireland. Geldof initially managed the band but took over the lead vocals from Garry Roberts. Initially known as The Nightlife Thugs, the group changed their name to The Boomtown Rats, which Geldof had taken from the name of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s boyhood gang mentioned in Guthrie&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;.

In the summer of 1976, the group played their first UK gig before moving to London where they signed with Ensign Records later that year. Their first single, &quot;Lookin&#x27; After No. 1&quot;, released in August 1977 after a year of touring, including a support slot with Tom Petty. It reached the Top 40 of the UK singles chart at No. 11. Their first album &quot;The Boomtown Rats&quot; was released the following month and included another single, &quot;Mary of the 4th Form&quot; reached No. 15 in December. Music journalist Martin C. Strong commented, &quot;Geldof&#x27;s moody charisma helped to give the band a distinct identity&quot;.

=== Mainstream success ===

The band together with producer Mutt Lange embarked on recording their next album, &quot;A Tonic for the Troops&quot; (1978). In May, the first single &quot;She&#x27;s So Modern&quot; reached No. 12 in UK charts. A headlining tour around the UK culminated in a show filmed at the Hammersmith Odeon. The second single &quot;Like Clockwork&quot; reached the UK Top Ten at No. 6 in July. The album was released shortly after, while in early November, the third single &quot;Rat Trap&quot; became the first rock song by an Irish band to reach No. 1 in the UK. In addition, &quot;Rat Trap&quot; was also the first new wave song to claim the number one spot. The U.S. version of the album (with a slightly different selection of tracks) came out the next year on Columbia Records. 

The band returned to the recording studio with Lange to produce a follow-up in 1979, while they embarked on a U.S. tour in support of the album with moderate success. The single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; was released in July, also reached No. 1 in the UK. The song was written in response to a school shooting in California, and became a worldwide Top Ten hit, except for the United States. It was the band&#x27;s only song to reach the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was included in the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Fine Art of Surfacing&quot; released in November of that year. The album also contained &quot;Diamond Smiles&quot; and their next Top 10 hit in the UK, &quot;Someone&#x27;s Looking at You&quot;.

In December 1980, &quot;Banana Republic&quot; was released, which was their last Top 10 hit, reaching No. 3. In the following year, the Boomtown Rats&#x27; next studio album &quot;Mondo Bongo&quot; produced by Tony Visconti appeared. A second single, &#x27;Elephant&#x27;s Graveyard (Guilty)&#x27;, charted at 26, while the title track appears in the U.S. without much success. During the subsequent tour, Gerry Cott decided to depart the band that continues as a quintet. In December 1981 the single &#x27;Never in a Million Years&#x27; stalled at No. 62 in the UK charts.

The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;V Deep&quot;, again produced by Visconti, was released in February 1982. A second single from the album &quot;House on Fire&quot; made number 24 in the UK singles chart. A third, &#x27;Charmed Lives&#x27; failed to chart however. In the U.S., the album was initially rejected by their American label, which instead issued a four-song EP called &quot;The Boomtown Rats&quot;, featuring four selections from &quot;V Deep&quot;. The full album was eventually issued in the U.S. in late 1982. The same year Geldof appeared in the film &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; directed by Alan Parker.

A follow-up album entitled &quot;In The Long Grass&quot; was recorded in 1983, but was initially rejected by the group&#x27;s label. By 1984, the band was touring universities after becoming unable to fund the &quot;guarantee&quot; required to book mainstream concert halls. &quot;In The Long Grass&quot; was finally issued in the UK in May 1984, but failed to chart. Two singles, &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Drag Me Down&quot;, were taken from the album; these reached the lower rungs of the UK singles chart, but two further singles, &quot;Dave&quot; and &quot;A Hold of Me&quot;, failed to register.

The Boomtown Rats&#x27; involvement with Band Aid (on which they all played) raised their profile again, and in January 1985, a revised version of &quot;In the Long Grass&quot; was finally released in the U.S. The album made the U.S. charts at No. 188, but the associated singles failed to make an impact on the charts or on the radio. The band subsequently performed at Live Aid&#x27;s charity performance.

&quot;Dave&quot;, a single from the original release of &quot;In the Long Grass&quot;, was re-recorded as &quot;Rain&quot; for the U.S. market. The song was about the band&#x27;s saxophone player and school friend David McHale, who had suffered a breakdown after his girlfriend was found dead in a public toilet next to an empty heroin bag.

===Break up===
After Live Aid, the band was on hiatus while Geldof focused on the Band Aid Trust. The band&#x27;s final performance came at Self Aid, a May 1986 concert at the RDS in Dublin, to raise awareness of unemployment in Ireland. Their rendition of &quot;Joey&#x27;s on the Street Again&quot; was 12 minutes long, with an extended bridge, during which time Geldof ran among the crowd. It also included a rendition of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot;, which provided circularity and closure. Following this performance, Geldof addressed the crowd, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s been a great ten years; rest in peace&quot;. The band then performed &quot;Looking After No.1&quot;.

Following the band&#x27;s break-up, Geldof launched a solo career with Pete Briquette continuing to work alongside him.

Garry Roberts co-wrote songs for Kirsty MacColl before leaving the music business and going on to become a successful salesman of financial services. Roberts later presented his Guitar Workshop to schools, encouraging pupils to play the instrument and emphasising the contribution of the blues to modern rock and pop music.

Fingers became a successful record producer in Japan, as well as being part of the Japanese band Greengate. Simon Crowe was in the West Country-based Celtic instrumental band Jiggerypipery and has also run a clock-making business.

In 2005, the band&#x27;s albums were all remastered and re-released and a &#x27;Best Of&#x27; compilation was released, along with two DVDs. Briquette mixed the live DVD and Francesco Cameli mixed the extra tracks for the re-release of the Boomtown Rats albums at Sphere Studios in London.

===The Rats===
In 2008, Garry Roberts and Simon Crowe, who had continued playing together in The Fab Four, with Alan Perman (ex Herman&#x27;s Hermits) and Bob Doyle (who once auditioned unsuccessfully for E.L.O.), and The Velcro Flies, with Steve (Dusty) Hill and Gavin Petrie, got together as &quot;The Rats&quot;, playing their favourite Boomtown Rats songs, with two guitars, bass and drums. The band was initially fronted by Peter Barton, who since the early 1980s has played with several resurrected acts, including The Animals, The Hollies and Lieutenant Pigeon. Barton was replaced on lead vocals and bass by Bob Bradbury, who was the founder and main songwriter in Hello. Darren Beale, formerly of The Caves, played lead guitar. Saxophone player Andy Hamilton, who toured and recorded with The Boomtown Rats, including at Live Aid, played as a guest at some gigs.

Gerry Cott and Johnnie Fingers were invited to join the band when circumstances allowed. Cott attended The Rats&#x27; second gig (at The 100 Club on Oxford Street, London). Fingers, meanwhile, worked for the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, but planned to join the band on stage when he was in the UK.

On 21 June 2009, Geldof, Roberts, and Briquette got together in Dublin to play &quot;Dave&quot;, at a party to celebrate the life of Boomtown Rats&#x27; close friend and saxophone player, &quot;Doctor&quot; Dave MacHale, who had died of cancer in Frankfurt.

On 20 September 2011, Gerry Cott guested with Geldof&#x27;s band at The Cadogan Hall, London. They played three Boomtown Rats songs prior to the encores. Cott returned to the stage for the final encore playing on two Geldof solo songs.

===The Boomtown Rats reform===
Bob Geldof, Gary Roberts, Pete Briquette, and Simon Crowe reunited as The Boomtown Rats in 2013, joined by Alan Dunn (longtime member of Geldof&#x27;s band) on keyboards and Darren Beale (who played with Roberts &amp; Crowe in The Rats) on guitar. Bob Geldof said, &quot;Playing again with the Rats and doing those great songs again will be exciting afresh. We were an amazing band and I just feel it&#x27;s the right time to re-Rat, to go back to Boomtown for a visit.&quot; In June 2013, it was announced that the band would be embarking on a UK and Ireland tour supported by a new compilation album, &quot;Back to Boomtown: Classic Rats Hits&quot;. The group performed at the Brentwood Festival in 2016, where Geldof attracted controversy for criticising the audience. In April 2017, the band returned to the studio to record new material for their first studio album since &quot;In the Long Grass&quot; in 1984. In March 2020, they released a new album, &quot;Citizens of Boomtown&quot;, and a lead single, &quot;Trash Glam Baby&quot;.

<doc id="254664" wikidata="Q13693" url="?curid=254664" title="Windshield">
<text>The windshield (American English and Canadian English) or windscreen (Commonwealth English) of an aircraft, car, bus, motorbike, truck, train, boat or streetcar is the front window, which provides visibility while protecting occupants from the elements. Modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass, a type of treated glass, which consists of, typically, two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer laminated between them for safety, and bonded into the window frame.

Motorcycle windshields are often made of high-impact polycarbonate or acrylic plastic.

==Usage==

Windshields protect the vehicle&#x27;s occupants from wind and flying debris such as dust, insects, and rocks, and provide an aerodynamically formed window towards the front. UV coating may be applied to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation. However, this is usually unnecessary since most auto windshields are made from laminated safety glass. The majority of UV-B is absorbed by the glass itself, and any remaining UV-B together with most of the UV-A is absorbed by the PVB bonding layer.

On motorbikes their main function is to shield the rider from wind, though not as completely as in a car, whereas on sports and racing motorcycles the main function is reducing drag when the rider assumes the optimal aerodynamic configuration with their body in unison with the machine and does not shield the rider from wind when sitting upright.

==Safety==


Early windshields were made of ordinary window glass, but that could lead to serious injuries in the event of a crash. A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields. The most notable example of this is the &quot;Pane vs. Ford&quot; case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through reckless driving. They were replaced with windshields made of toughened glass and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or neoprene seal. The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke. These windshields, however, could shatter from a simple stone chip. &quot;Triplex&quot; glass laminating, however, had been available for windshields in France from 1911 and in Britain from 1912; it was adopted as an accessory by some high-end American auto manufacturers beginning in 1913, and from 1919 to 1929 Henry Ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his vehicles.

Modern, glued-in windshields contribute to the vehicle&#x27;s rigidity, but the main force for innovation has historically been the need to prevent injury from sharp glass fragments. Almost all nations now require windshields to stay in one piece even if broken, except if pierced by a strong force.

The urethane sealant is protected from UV in sunlight by a band of dark dots called a &quot;frit&quot; around the edge of the windshield. The darkened edge transitions to the clear windshield with smaller dots to minimize thermal stress in manufacturing. The same band of darkened dots is often expanded around the rearview mirror to act as a sunshade.

On a rainy day, water refraction on aircraft windshields can mislead pilots into believing that they are flying at a higher altitude than they actually are due to the horizon appearing lower than it is. This can result in undershooting the runway and become a safety hazard.

==Other aspects==

In many places, laws restrict the use of heavily tinted glass in vehicle windshields; generally, laws specify the maximum level of tint permitted. Some vehicles have noticeably more tint in the uppermost part of the windshield to block sunglare.

In aircraft windshields, an electric current is applied through a conducting layer of tin(IV) oxide to generate heat to prevent icing. A similar system for automobile windshields, introduced on Ford vehicles as &quot;Quickclear&quot; in Europe (&quot;InstaClear&quot; in North America) in the 1980s and through the early 1990s, used this conductive metallic coating applied to the inboard side of the outer layer of glass. Other glass manufacturers utilize a grid of micro-thin wires to conduct the heat especially on the later European Ford Transit vans. These systems are more typically utilized by European auto manufacturers such as Jaguar and Porsche.

The use of thermal glass prevents some navigation systems from functioning correctly, as the embedded metal blocks the satellite signal. The RF signal tends to flow along the metal wires or layer so very little radiation can pass. This can be resolved by using an external antenna. Mobile telephones can also have problems; thermal glass typically allows only 0.001 (1‰, or one per mille) of the signal to pass, whereas a concrete wall with rebars allows up to 0.100 (10%, or 100‰) of the signal to pass.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;windshield&quot; is used generally throughout the US and Canada. The term &quot;windscreen&quot; is the usual term in the British Isles and Australasia for all vehicles. In the US &quot;windscreen&quot; refers to the mesh or foam placed over a microphone to minimize wind noise, while a &quot;windshield&quot; refers to the front window of a car.
In the UK, the terms are reversed, although generally, the foam screen is referred to as a microphone shield, and not a windshield.

Sports or racing cars would sometimes have aero screens, which were small semi-circular or rectangular windshields. These were often mounted in pairs behind a foldable flat windshield. Aero screens are usually less than in height. They are known as aero screens because they only deflect the wind. The twin aeroscreen setup (often called Brooklands) was popular among older sports and modern cars in vintage style.

A &quot;wiperless windshield&quot; is a windshield that uses a mechanism other than wipers to remove snow and rain from the windshield. The concept car Acura TL features a wiperless windshield using a series of jet nozzles in the cowl to blow pressurized air onto the windshield. Also several glass manufacturers have experimented with nano type coatings designed to repel external contaminants with varying degrees of success but to date none of these have made it to commercial applications.

In the context of cargo ships, a windshield may refer to a bow windshield, a structure fitted on the bow to decrease drag and improve fuel efficiency. 

== Certification ==
Certification of a windshield is necessary to ensure safety. Different counties have made different set of rule that all windshield manufacturers need to comply under Motor Vehicle Acts. Some of the most know certifications are US DOT, EU ECE, Chinese CCC, South African SABS and Indian BIS standards. These certification ensures safety, reliability and quality of a product as per respective legal requirements.

==Repair of stone-chip and crack damage==
According to the US National Windshield Repair Association, many types of stone damage can be successfully repaired. Whether the windshield can be repaired always depends upon four factors: the size, type, depth and location of the damage.

===Size and depth===
Repair of cracks up to is within permissible limits; automobile glass with more severe damage needs to be replaced. However, this is dependent on local laws. If a crack extends to the edge of the panel then this would compromise the structural integrity of the windshield. Aircraft windshields are designed in such a way that even if a crack were to extend all the way across the panel, the structural integrity is maintained via multiple failsafe methods in both frame and the glass plies. A sacrificial outer layer that cracks rather than devitrifies is the first failsafe.

===Type===
Circular bullseyes, linear cracks, crack chips, dings, pits and star-shaped breaks can be repaired without removing the glass, eliminating the risk of leaking or bonding problems sometimes associated with replacement.

===Location===

Some damages are very difficult to repair, or cannot be repaired:
* on inside of the windshield
* deep damage on both layers of glass due to solar absorption or oxidation.
* damage over rain sensor or internal radio antenna
* complex multiple cracks
* very long cracks (i.e. over long)
* contaminated cracks
* edge cracks

In cracked windshield repair, air is removed from the damaged area on the windshield with a specified vacuum injection pump. Then using the injection pump, the clear adhesive resin is injected to replace the air in the windshield crack. The resin is then cured with an ultraviolet light. When done properly, the damaged area’s strength is restored, as is 90–95% of the clarity.

==Replacement==

Windshields that cannot be repaired have to be replaced. Replacement of a windshield typically takes less than an hour. To ensure the vehicle is safe to drive, time values called the Safe Drive Away Time have been established. Windshields which have been replaced must cure or bond sufficiently until they are able to withstand the forces of a crash. Knowing the minimum time needed to cure the glass bonding adhesives is therefore important. This safe drive away time (SDAT) or minimum drive away time (MDAT) refers to the time required until a windshield installation or glass replacement is considered safe to drive again. Criteria are specified in U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 212/208 (see FMVSS) to ensure the reliability of adhesive systems. Typically the SDAT is verified with crash tests as well as with high-speed laboratory test methods.

Consumers may be unaware that the MDAT or SDAT time is focused on safety and not necessarily on the quality, durability, or warranty of the installation. Care must be taken not to drive the vehicle prior to the SDAT/MDAT.

Airbags deploy at speeds up to and in some cases exert tremendous force on the windshield. Occupants can impact the airbag just 50  ms after initial deployment. Depending on vehicle design, airbag deployment and/or occupant impact into the airbag may increase forces on the windshield, dramatically in some cases.
Forces of occupants on the airbags - and hence the potential forces on the windshield - are lower for belted occupants. As consequence, adhesive suppliers usually inform their customers about the level of security achieved:

1) Example: Security exceeding FMVSS 212/208 belted

2) Example: Security exceeding FMVSS 212/208 unbelted

With the advent of quick-cure adhesives, mobile windshield replacements have become more prevalent. Often the temperature and humidity cannot be controlled for mobile installations. For most common glass adhesives the ideal environment is and 50% humidity. Variations from the ideal curing environment can increase the time needed for a sufficiently safe bond to form. Because of the variables and difficulties involved in mobile windshield replacement, many vehicle manufacturers do not recommend this method of installations.

==Disposal==
Waste disposal of laminated glass is no longer permitted in a landfill in most European countries as the End of Life Vehicles Directive (ELV) is implemented. A study by Surrey University and Pilkington Glass proposes that waste laminated glass be placed into a separating device such as a rolling mill where the glass is fragmented and the larger cullet is mechanically detached from the inner film. The application of heat then melts the laminating plastic, usually, polyvinyl butyral &quot;PVB&quot; enabling both the glass and the interior film to be recycled. The PVB recycling process is a simple procedure of melting and reshaping it.
One possible method of recycling of simple automotive laminated windshields could involve heating the windshield to above the melting point of the PVB interlayer and then separating the glass plies. This depends chiefly on the differential melting points of PVB and glass and is not suitable for other interlayer materials such as silicone based materials.

<text>Lori Helene Berenson (born November 13, 1969) is an American who served a 20-year prison sentence for collaboration with a guerrilla organization in Peru in 1996. Berenson was convicted of collaborating with the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), a group accused of trying to overthrow the Peruvian government by force, considered to be a terrorist organization by the Peruvian government, and on the U.S. State Department&#x27;s official &quot;terrorist organization&quot; list from 1997–2001. Her arrest and conviction, and the circumstances surrounding her trials, drew considerable attention in both the United States and Peru.

== Early life and education ==
Berenson was born and raised in New York City to Rhoda and Mark Berenson, both college professors. After graduating from LaGuardia High School of Music and Art, she enrolled at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1987. On her web site, she states that she volunteered for soup kitchens and blood banks and also worked as a mother&#x27;s helper in the Hamptons as a teenager. While an undergraduate at MIT, she volunteered with the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES). She dropped out of MIT in 1988 as a sophomore majoring in archeology and anthropology and continued to volunteer for CISPES. Later, she went to El Salvador and became secretary and interpreter for Leonel González, a leader of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), during negotiations that achieved peace in 1992. FMLN was at that time an umbrella organization associated with various leftist guerrilla organizations and the Salvadoran Communist Party and working to overthrow the Salvadoran military dictatorship. FMLN transitioned during the peace process in order to become a legal political party. González (aka Salvador Sánchez Cerén) was the President of El Salvador.

== Activities in Peru and arrest ==
In Peru, Berenson met members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), a group accused of committing terrorist attacks in Peru including kidnapping, bank robberies, extortion, hostage taking, and assassinations. Berenson initially denied knowing that they were MRTA members. After acknowledging that her associates were members she maintained that she did not know the group was planning to conduct an attack on Peru’s Congress or planning any other act of violence.

Berenson obtained press credentials for herself and her photographer to the Congress of Peru to interview some of its members and attend sessions where she took notes and sketched a seating plan. Afterwards, the media reported these to be &quot;false journalist credentials&quot;. Berenson and those who supported her contended that she was on assignment from two U.S. publications, &quot;Modern Times&quot; and &quot;Third World Viewpoint&quot;, to work as a free-lance journalist writing articles about the effects of poverty on women in Perú. Her photographer, Nancy Gilvonio, was actually the wife of Néstor Cerpa, the MRTA second-in-command — although Berenson maintained she was unaware of this connection, saying that she knew her only as a Bolivian photographer. Berenson had entered the main Congress building with Gilvonio several times during 1995 to interview members of Congress. Gilvonio was alleged to have provided the information she collected to the MRTA including detailed information on the floor plans of Congress, its security and members. The alleged plan was for the MRTA to invade the Congress building, kidnap the legislators, and exchange the hostages for MRTA prisoners. 

On November 30, 1995, Berenson and Gilvonio were arrested on a public bus in downtown Lima. Berenson was accused of being a leader of the MRTA, which had been officially classified as a terrorist group by the government.

Within hours after Berenson&#x27;s arrest, the government launched an all-night siege of the MRTA safe house in an upscale neighborhood in Lima which Berenson had co-rented with an associate. At the end of the siege, three MRTA guerrillas and one police officer had died and 14 guerrillas were captured. The upper floors of the house were found to contain an &quot;arsenal of weapons&quot; and ammunition including 3,000 sticks of dynamite. Diagrams, notes, weapons, and police and military uniforms found at the safe house suggested that the group was planning to seize members of Congress and trade them for captured guerrillas. Police also seized a floor plan and a scale architectural model of the Congress building. After being taken to the house siege, in which Berenson claims she was used as a human shield by the Peruvian police, both women were taken to the DINCOTE (&quot;División Nacional Contra el Terrorismo&quot;, or National Counterterrorism Division).

Berenson said that she was unaware of what was happening on the upper floors and had even moved out some months prior to her arrest. She denied knowing of the presence of either the weaponry or the guerrillas, and she also denied knowing that the documents she prepared would be used for terrorism. She later admitted that she had learned that her associates were MRTA members and she said: &quot;It might not have been intentional, but the bottom line is: I did collaborate with them.&quot; In the same interview she maintained that she had not been aware that weapons were being amassed in the upper floors of her house which she had sublet to the MRTA members, and she also maintained that she was unaware that violent actions were being planned at the Congress, stating that &quot;at that time in Fujimori&#x27;s dictatorship, Congress was the only place that there was some sort of democratic process.&quot;

On January 8, 1996, the DINCOTE hosted a news event in which they showed Berenson to the press. At the event, she shouted in Spanish, with her fists clenched to her sides, in a statement to the local reporters:

The image of Berenson defiantly shouting to the press continues to make her unpopular in Peru. Her supporters later offered the explanation that her vehement defense of MRTA came about because she was angry over the treatment of a wounded cell mate and that she was instructed by authorities to shout in order to be heard.

== Trials ==
After she was tried in 1996 and sentenced to life imprisonment, Berenson became, as &quot;The Guardian&quot; put it, a &quot;&quot;cause celèbre&quot; for human rights campaigners and a symbol for leftwing social activists around the world&quot;, except in Peru, where parties and newspapers across the political spectrum condemned her actions, and criticized the unwillingness of European and American media, even progressive ones, to apply the label &quot;terrorist&quot; to citizens of &quot;First World&quot; countries. 

Elements of her trial were criticized in statements from institutions ranging from the US State Department to Amnesty International to be violations of human rights and lacking in impartiality, provoking controversy in the United States and other countries. In particular, she was allegedly denied the right to examine the government&#x27;s evidence and witnesses. 

In accordance with anti-terrorism legislation enacted during a state of emergency declared by the authoritarian government of President Alberto Fujimori, Berenson was tried in a closed courtroom by a military tribunal on a charge of treason against the fatherland for leadership of a terrorist organization. This charge did not require Peruvian citizenship as an element.

The proceedings were conducted by a hooded military judge who spoke through a voice distortion apparatus (judges often concealed their identities to protect themselves from assassination). On January 11, 1996, six weeks after her arrest and three days after her presentation to the media, Berenson was convicted of all charges and sentenced to life in prison without parole. An appeal lodged against the conviction was dismissed on January 30. Due to the nature of the closed military court, human rights campaigners protested her conviction and disputed the fairness of the proceedings. 

In February 1999, after three years of fact-finding, the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that Ms. Berenson had been arbitrarily deprived of her liberty in violation of various articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Peru is a signatory. According to the Carter Center among the violations of international legal standards and due process, &quot;Ms. Berenson&#x27;s trial was in a secret military court, where her lawyer was not allowed to cross-examine witnesses or challenge evidence,&quot; and former president Carter stated directly that he was &quot;deeply concerned that Lori Berenson has not been afforded her rights of due process by law.&quot;

In 2000, following a change of government in Peru and after years of political pressure from the United States and the human rights community, Peru&#x27;s Supreme Military Council overturned Berenson&#x27;s treason conviction and life sentence and remanded her case to the civilian court for retrial. On June 20, 2001, a three-judge panel convicted Berenson of collaboration with terrorists, but ruled she was not a terrorist. She was sentenced to 20 years, with consideration given for time already served under her prior conviction.

In 2002, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States condemned the system under which Berenson was tried. Alleging violations of the American Convention on Human Rights, to which Peru is a party, Berenson&#x27;s case was referred to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights of the Organization of American States when the government of Peru refused to accept the Commission&#x27;s recommendations.

On November 25, 2004, the Inter-American Court upheld the conviction and sentence. The Court did condemn the judicial system under which Berenson was originally tried, and also condemned Berenson&#x27;s earlier incarceration at Yanamayo Prison. Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo hailed the verdict, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that few Peruvians have any sympathy for Berenson.

== Efforts to free Berenson ==
Over the years, there were several efforts made on behalf of Berenson, stemming from concerns she did not obtain a fair trial or was not receiving humanitarian treatment, or simply to obtain her release. Various endeavors came from Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.

According to her release website, in 1998, Amnesty International issued a press release declaring Berenson to be a political prisoner. Amnesty criticized the Peruvian anti-terrorism legislation, stating that, &quot;it is unacceptable for hundreds of political prisoners like Berenson not to be able to exercise their basic human right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.&quot;

In December 1996, the MRTA seized the Japanese Ambassador&#x27;s residence in Lima and demanded that MRTA prisoners be released in exchange for the release of their hostages. MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa, Nancy Gilvonio&#x27;s husband, led the takeover of the Embassy. Berenson was third on a list of MRTA prisoners whose release was sought by the hostage-takers. After 126 days, the standoff ended in a raid by Peruvian special forces in which all hostage-takers were killed. Two military personnel, commander EP Juan Valer Sandoval and captain EP Raúl Jiménez Chávez, and one of the seventy-two hostages, Carlos Giusti, were also killed.

On July 21, 1999, the United States House of Representatives voted against an amendment sponsored by US Rep. Maxine Waters described as &quot;to express the sense of Congress concerning support for democracy in Peru and the release of Lori Berenson&quot;. The vote failed 189 to 234.

In January 2002 Thomas Gumbleton, Bishop of Archdiocese of Detroit and founder of Pax Christi USA, visited with Berenson to work with Peruvian government officials &quot;for her release.&quot;

Columns were written for American newspapers, such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times,&quot; calling on the US to pressure Peru to free Berenson. Other writers, however, took the contrary position, including the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; online edition. Her parents had a short independent film made in protest against her earlier military trial, and her story was reported on several top television news shows. Her parents continued to work for her release and their website provided regular updates on Berenson&#x27;s situation.

== Imprisonment ==
Berenson spent her early years in prison at facilities high in the Andes, the first of which the Inter-American Court ruled is operated inhumanely. The Yanamayo prison where Berenson was initially held for about three years lies at about above sea level near Lake Titicaca in the Puno Region, in southern Peru.

On October 7, 1998, Berenson was moved to another prison in Socabaya. She remained there until August 31, 2000, when she was transferred to the women&#x27;s prison of Chorrillos in Lima. Then, on December 21, 2001, she was relocated to the maximum-security Huacariz Penitentiary in Cajamarca, north of Lima.

In February 2002, Berenson took part in a 25-day hunger strike of &quot;political prisoners&quot; in an attempt to influence the government of Peru to improve prison conditions and revise its anti-terrorism laws. The strike ended without reaching its goals, though less than a year later, Peru revised many of those laws.

In October 2003, Berenson married Aníbal Apari Sánchez, 40, whom she had met in 1997 when they were both incarcerated at Yanamayo prison. Apari Sánchez was convicted of being a member of the MRTA. When he was released in 2003 on conditional liberty (parole) in Lima, his travel was restricted, and he was accordingly not present at the wedding in Cajamarca and had to be represented by his father. Later he was allowed conjugal visits. Apari Sánchez is now a practicing attorney in Lima and directs a non-governmental organization (NGO) that assists individuals formerly imprisoned on charges of assisting or being members of the MRTA in their rehabilitation into society. He is also co-founder of a political party, , that participated in the 2011 national elections.

From 2003 through 2008 Berenson worked in and co-managed the bakery at Huacariz Prison which served the inmate population and the Cajamarca community.

Periodically, through her &quot;freelori.org&quot; web page entitled &quot;Lori&#x27;s Words,&quot; Berenson issued advice to youth as well as criticism of the policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the war in Iraq, the &quot;American Way of Life,&quot; the Peruvian &quot;political class,&quot; and allegations of maltreatment and torture of prisoners. Berenson&#x27;s commentaries on capitalism, globalism, and the environmental impact of mining companies have also appeared on the Internet. In addition, her commentaries have been read on the Prison Radio Project, a San Francisco-based radio and activist project that produces the commentaries of several political prisoners.

On September 16, 2008, her father announced that she was pregnant with her first child. In January 2009, Berenson was transferred to a prison in Lima owing to a serious back problem which complicated her pregnancy. In May 2009, she gave birth to a boy, whom she named Salvador, and who lived with her while she was in prison. In Peru, children are allowed to remain with their incarcerated mothers until age 3.

== Release ==
Peru&#x27;s Justice Minister Victor García Toma on May 3, 2010, stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t think Lori Berenson can create harm for society, but she has created anger among citizens,&quot; and recommended that the remaining five years of her sentence be commuted and that she be expelled from Peru to the U.S., indicating that his recommendation was based on a legal and political analysis of the circumstances.

On May 25, 2010, after serving 15 years, Berenson was granted a conditional release, with the judge stating that she would have to remain in Peru on parole for the remaining five years of her sentence, but would be freed from prison. 

Berenson&#x27;s attorneys submitted documents to the court indicating that she &quot;recognized she committed errors&quot; by associating herself with the MRTA. She was freed two days later, a release which attracted a media circus. She was driven to an apartment in the upscale Miraflores area of Lima, where her new neighbors welcomed her by shouting &quot;terrorist&quot; at her. Berenson&#x27;s parents indicated that she would separate from Apari and raise her son, Salvador, as a single mother. Peru&#x27;s Minister of Justice, García Toma, stated that the Cabinet might commute Berenson&#x27;s sentence and expel her from the country.

With protesters gathering daily outside her Lima apartment building, lighting candles and demanding that she be either deported from Peru or reimprisoned, Berenson sent a letter to President Alan García acknowledging her &quot;criminal responsibility for terrorist collaboration&quot;, and further writing, &quot;I would also like to say that I very much regret the harm I have caused Peruvian society, and I ask forgiveness from people who have been affected by my actions or words.&quot; She then requested that her sentence be commuted so she could return to the United States.

On June 8, 2010, former U.S. president Bill Clinton, speaking while on a visit to Peru, expressed his support for Berenson&#x27;s release, stating &quot;I&#x27;m glad Lori Berenson was released ... when I was president, I worked for that.&quot;

Peru&#x27;s state attorney for counterterrorism, Julio Galindo, appealed Berenson&#x27;s parole, depicting her as a calculating, unrepentant extremist who posed a continuing threat to the Peruvian public. On August 16, 2010, Berenson appeared before the appeals court to request she be allowed to remain free on parole. In responding to Galindo&#x27;s allegations, she stated that she was not a threat to society:

On August 18, 2010, the appeals court annulled Berenson&#x27;s parole and returned her to prison while technical aspects of the parole were considered. On November 5, a Peruvian judge ordered that she be released from prison. On November 8, she was again released on parole, still required to remain in Peru until her sentence ended. In January 2011, an appeals court rejected a prosecutor&#x27;s attempt to revoke her parole. Berenson and her attorney told reporters that the ruling was final and could not be appealed by prosecutors, ending eight months of legal uncertainty.

Constitutional law expert Mario Amoretti, while agreeing that the ruling should be final, remarked that the state conceivably could file a challenge, claiming some constitutional violation, but he said he did not see grounds for such an appeal. Berenson was required to remain in Peru on supervised parole until her 20-year sentence ended in 2015, unless the sentence was commuted by the President. When he was President, Alan García said he would consider a commutation only after the legal case had run its course.

In December 2011, a Peruvian court issued Berenson a three-week travel permit to visit her family in New York City. Authorities at the airport initially blocked her leaving, prompting fresh calls from her lawyer for Peruvian authorities to respect the decision of the Peruvian judiciary. She finally arrived on December 20. After spending Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day visiting her parents in New York, she returned to Lima, Peru on January 6, 2012. She remained on parole until the completion of her 20-year sentence on November 29, 2015, whereupon she was permitted to leave Peru permanently.

At midnight on December 2, 2015, Berenson left Lima on a flight to New York.

<doc id="254670" wikidata="Q1631447" url="?curid=254670" title="Household Words">
<text>Household Words was an English weekly magazine edited by Charles Dickens in the 1850s. It took its name from the line in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;: &quot;Familiar in his mouth as household words.&quot;

==History==
During the planning stages, titles originally considered by Dickens included &quot;The Robin&quot;, &quot;The Household Voice&quot;, &quot;The Comrade&quot;, &quot;The Lever&quot;, and &quot;The Highway of Life&quot;.

&quot;Household Words&quot; was published every Saturday from March 1850 to May 1859. Each number cost a mere tuppence, thereby ensuring a wide readership. The publication&#x27;s first edition carried a section covering the paper&#x27;s principles, entitled &quot;A Preliminary Word&quot;:

A longer version of the publication&#x27;s principles appeared in newspapers such as &quot;The Argus&quot; in September 1850.

Theoretically, the paper championed the cause of the poor and working classes, but in fact it addressed itself almost exclusively to the middle class. Only the name of Dickens, the journal&#x27;s &quot;conductor&quot;, appeared; articles were unsigned (although authors of serialised novels were identified) and, in spite of its regularly featuring an &quot;advertiser&quot;, the paper was unillustrated.

To boost slumping sales Dickens serialised his own novel, &quot;Hard Times&quot;, in weekly parts between 1 April and 12 August 1854. It had the desired effect, more than doubling the journal&#x27;s circulation and encouraging the author, who remarked that he was, &quot;three–parts mad, and the fourth delirious, with perpetual rushing at &quot;Hard Times&quot;&quot;.

That Dickens owned half of the company and his agents, John Forster and William Henry Wills, owned a further quarter of it was insurance that the author would have a free hand in the paper. Wills was also appointed associate editor and, in December 1849, Dickens&#x27;s acquaintance, writer and poet Richard Henry Horne was appointed sub-editor at a salary of &quot;five guineas a week&quot;. In 1859, however, owing to a dispute between Dickens and the publishers Bradbury and Evans over their refusal to print his &quot;personal statement&quot; regarding his divorce in their other magazine, &quot;Punch&quot;, publication ceased and &quot;Household Words&quot; was replaced by &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, over which Dickens had greater control.

The journal contained a mixture of fiction and nonfiction. A large amount of the non-fiction dealt with the social issues of the time.

==Serialized works==

<text>An in-joke, also known as an inside joke or a private joke, is a joke with humour that is understandable only to members of an ingroup; that is, people who are &quot;in&quot; a particular social group, occupation, or other community of shared interest. It is, therefore, an joke, only humorous to those who are aware of the circumstances behind it. 

Typically, inside jokes use a reference in the punchline to imply that which is associated with the reference. Often, this reference refers to the punchline of another joke which was already heard by the ingroup.

In-jokes may exist within a small social clique, such as a group of friends, or extend to an entire profession or other relatively large group. When the ingroup only includes people which heard the previous portion of a comedic set, the type of inside joke is known as a callback.

An example is:
::Q: What&#x27;s yellow and equivalent to the axiom of choice?
::A: Zorn&#x27;s lemon.
Individuals not familiar with the mathematical result Zorn&#x27;s lemma are unlikely to understand the joke. The joke is a pun on the name of this result. 

Ethnic or religious groups may also have in-jokes.

==Philosophy==
In-jokes are cryptic allusions to shared common ground that act as selective triggers; only those who share that common ground are able to respond appropriately. An in-joke may be used to build community, sometimes at the expense of outsiders. Part of the power of an in-joke is that its audience knows that many do not understand it.

An in-joke can also be used as a subtext, where people in the know may find humor in something not explicitly spoken. They may even apologize for doing so to a rookie, directly or indirectly stating that what they were laughing at was an in-joke.

<doc id="254677" wikidata="Q1370583" url="?curid=254677" title="Superstructure">
<text>A superstructure is an upward extension of an existing structure above a baseline. This term is applied to various kinds of physical structures such as buildings, bridges, or ships.

==Aboard ships and large boats==
On water craft, the superstructure consists of the parts of the ship or a boat, including sailboats, fishing boats, passenger ships, and submarines, that project above her main deck. This does not usually include its masts or any armament turrets. Note that, in modern times, turrets do not always carry naval artillery. They can also carry missile launchers and/or antisubmarine warfare weapons.

The size of a watercraft&#x27;s superstructure can have many implications in the performance of ships and boats, since these structures can alter their structural rigidity, their displacements, and/or stability. These can be detrimental to any vessel&#x27;s performance if they are taken into consideration incorrectly.

The height and the weight of superstructure on board a ship or a boat also affects the amount of freeboard that such a vessel requires along its sides, down to her waterline. In broad terms, the more and heavier superstructure that a ship possesses (as a fraction of her length), the less the freeboard that is needed.

==Bridges==
The span of a bridge, the portion that directly receives the live load, is referred to as the superstructure. In contrast, the abutment, piers, and other support structures are called the &#x27;substructure&#x27;.

==Earthquake protection==

In order to improve the response during earthquakes of buildings and bridges, the superstructure may be separated from its foundation by various civil engineering mechanisms or machinery. All together, these implement the system of earthquake protection called base isolation.

<text>Henri François Joseph Vieuxtemps (; 17 February 18206 June 1881) was a Belgian composer and violinist. He occupies an important place in the history of the violin as a prominent exponent of the Franco-Belgian violin school during the mid-19th century. He is also known for playing what is now known as the Vieuxtemps Guarneri del Gesù, a violin of superior workmanship.

==Biography==

Vieuxtemps was born in Verviers, Belgium (then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands), son of a weaver and amateur violinist and violin-maker. He received his first violin instruction from his father and a local teacher and gave his first public performance at the age of six, playing a concerto by Pierre Rode. Soon he was giving concerts in various surrounding cities, including Liège and Brussels where he met the violinist Charles Auguste de Bériot, with whom he began studies.

In 1829, Bériot took him to Paris where he made a successful concert debut, again with a concerto by Rode, but he had to return the next year because of the July Revolution and Bériot&#x27;s marriage to his mistress Maria Malibran and departure on concert tour. Back in Brussels, Vieuxtemps continued developing his violin technique on his own, his musicianship deepened by playing with the deeply musical mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, Malibran&#x27;s sister. A tour of Germany in 1833 brought friendship with Louis Spohr and with Robert Schumann, who compared the boy to Niccolò Paganini. During the following decade he visited various European cities, impressing with his virtuosity not only audiences but also famous musicians such as Hector Berlioz and Paganini himself, whom he encountered at his London debut in 1834.

He had aspirations of becoming a composer as well and, having already taken lessons with the respected Simon Sechter in Vienna, spent the winter of 1835–1836 studying composition with Anton Reicha in Paris. His first violin concerto, later published as Concerto No. 2, dates from this time.

His Violin Concerto No. 1 was acclaimed when he played it in Saint Petersburg on his second visit in 1840 and in Paris the next year; Berlioz found it &quot;a magnificent symphony for violin and orchestra&quot;. Based in Paris, Vieuxtemps continued to compose with great success and perform throughout Europe. With the pianist Sigismond Thalberg, he performed in the United States. 

In early 1846 he visited the English city of Leeds where he met and offered to tutor George Haddock whilst he performed in London. Haddock and Vieuxtemps became friends and he would stay with Haddock when visiting and performing in Leeds.

He was particularly admired in Russia where he resided permanently between 1846 and 1851 as a court musician of Tsar Nicholas I and soloist in the Imperial Theatre. He founded the violin school of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and guided the formation of a &quot;Russian school&quot; of violinists. In 1871, he returned to his native country to accept a professorship at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, where his most illustrious pupil was Eugène Ysaÿe.

A paralytic stroke disabled his right arm two years later and he moved to Paris again, his violin class being taken over by Henryk Wieniawski. Although he seemed to be gradually recovering from his stroke, another one in 1879 ended his career as a violinist for good. He spent his last years in a sanatorium in Mustapha Supérieur, Algeria, where his daughter and her husband had settled, and continued to compose, though frustrated by his inability to play or, far from the musical centres of Europe, even hear his music played by others.

The bulk of Vieuxtemps&#x27; compositions were for his own instrument, including seven concertos and a variety of short salon pieces, though towards the end of his life, when he had to give up the violin, he often turned to other instruments, writing two cello concertos, a viola sonata and three string quartets among other things. It is because of his seven violin concertos, however, that Vieuxtemps is generally known to audiences and musicians around the world. Through his own concertos and his advocacy of the concertos of Beethoven (he also played Beethoven&#x27;s sonatas and string quartets) and Mendelssohn, he added a more classical dimension to the violin repertoire which had tended towards technically brilliant but often shallow variations and fantasies on popular operatic themes. Vieuxtemps never indulged in sheer virtuosity for its own sake, like some of his predecessors. Eugène Ysaÿe quotes him as saying &quot;Not runs for the sake of runs – sing, sing!&quot;

==Vieuxtemps del Gesù==
Vieuxtemps is also known for owning and playing what is now referred to as the Vieuxtemps Guarneri del Gesù, a violin, built in 1741, that is considered one of the finest examples of the craftsmanship of Giuseppe Guarneri and which is considered to be without defect despite its continued use over many years. The &quot;del Gesù&quot; (literally &quot;of Jesus&quot;) refers to the manufacture by Bartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri who incorporated the nomina sacra, I.H.S. (iota-eta-sigma) and a Roman Cross in the labels he affixed to his work. At Vieuxtemps&#x27; funeral the violin was carried upon a pillow behind the hearse carrying the body. The instrument was later played by noted violin masters like Yehudi Menuhin, Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman. In January 2012 the instrument was purchased, by a private collector, for an undisclosed sum and lifetime use of it bequeathed to violinist Anne Akiko Meyers.

<doc id="254706" wikidata="Q191489" url="?curid=254706" title="Melodrama">
<text>A modern melodrama is a dramatic work in which plot, typically sensationalized for a strong emotional appeal, takes precedence over detailed characterization. Melodrama is &quot;an exaggerated version of drama&quot;. Melodramas typically concentrate on dialogue that is often bombastic or excessively sentimental, rather than on action. Characters are often flat and written to fulfill established character archetypes. Melodramas are typically set in the private sphere of the home, focusing on morality, family issues, love, and marriage, often with challenges from an outside source, such as a &quot;temptress&quot;, a scoundrel, or an aristocratic villain. A melodrama on stage, film, or television is usually accompanied by dramatic and suggestive music that offers further cues to the audience of the dramatic beats being presented.

In scholarly and historical musical contexts, melodramas are Victorian dramas in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action. The term &quot;melodrama&quot; is now also applied to stage performances without incidental music, novels, films, television, and radio broadcasts. In modern contexts, the term &quot;melodrama&quot; is generally pejorative, as it suggests that the work in question lacks subtlety, character development, or both. By extension, language or behavior that resembles melodrama is often called melodramatic; this use is nearly always pejorative.

==Etymology==
The term was first used in English in 1784 (in 1782 as &quot;melo drame&quot;) and came from the French word (), which was itself derived from Greek (&quot;song&quot; or &quot;music&quot;) and French (&quot;drama&quot;).

==Characteristics==
The relationship of melodrama and realism is complex. Protagonists of melodramatic works may be ordinary (and hence realistically drawn) people who are caught up in extraordinary events or highly exaggerated and unrealistic characters. With regard to its high emotions and dramatic rhetoric, melodrama represents a &quot;victory over repression&quot;. Late Victorian and Edwardian melodrama combined a conscious focus on realism in stage sets and props with &quot;anti-realism&quot; in character and plot. Melodrama in this period strove for &quot;credible accuracy in the depiction of incredible, extraordinary&quot; scenes. Novelist Wilkie Collins is noted for his attention to accurate detail (e.g., of legal matters) in his works, no matter how sensational the plot.

Melodramas focus on a victim. For example, a melodrama may present a person’s struggle between good and evil choices, such as a man being encouraged to leave his family by an &quot;evil temptress&quot;. Stock characters include the &quot;fallen woman&quot;, the single mother, the orphan, and the male who is struggling with the impacts of the modern world. The melodrama examines family and social issues in the context of a private home. Its intended audience is a female spectator, but a male viewer can also enjoy its presentation of resolved tensions in a home. Melodrama generally looks back at ideal, nostalgic eras, emphasizing &quot;forbidden longings&quot;.

Melodrama was associated with the rise of capitalism in the 19th century. French romantic drama and sentimental novels were popular in both England and France. These dramas and novels focused on moral codes in regard to family life, love, and marriage, and they can be seen as a reflection of issues brought up by the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and the shift to modernization. Many melodramas were about a middle-class young woman who experienced unwanted sexual advances from an aristocratic miscreant, the sexual assault being a metaphor for class conflict. The melodrama reflected post-Industrial Revolution anxieties of the middle class, who was afraid of both aristocratic power brokers and the impoverished working class &quot;mob&quot;. 

== Types ==

=== 18th-century origins: monodrama and duodrama ===
Melodrama arose in the second half of the 18th century as a genre intermediate between play and opera. It combined spoken recitation with short pieces of accompanying music. Music and spoken dialogue typically alternated in such works, although the music was sometimes also used to accompany pantomime. If there is one actor, the term &quot;monodrama&quot; may be used; if there are two— &quot;duodrama&quot;. It also sometimes appeared as a scene within a play or an opera. It was only later, in the nineteenth century, that the term lost its association with music and began to be used for plays with sentimental and sensational plots typical of popular Victorian drama.

The earliest known examples of melodrama are scenes in J. E. Eberlin&#x27;s Latin school play &quot;Sigismundus&quot; (1753). The first full melodrama was Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s monodrama &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, the text of which was written in 1762; it was first staged in Lyon in 1770. Rousseau composed the overture and an Andante, but the bulk of the music was composed by Horace Coignet.

A different musical setting of Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by Anton Schweitzer was performed in Weimar in 1772, and Goethe wrote of it approvingly in &quot;Dichtung und Wahrheit&quot;. 

Some 30 other monodramas were produced in Germany in the fourth quarter of the 18th century. Georg Benda was particularly successful with his duodramas &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (1775) and &quot;Medea&quot; (1775). The sensational success of Benda&#x27;s melodramas led others to compose similar works. Mozart, for example, spoke approvingly of Benda&#x27;s music and later used two long melodramatic monologues in his opera &quot;Zaide&quot; (1780).

Later and better-known examples of the melodramatic style in operas are the grave-digging scene in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; (1805) and the incantation scene in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1821).

===English Restoration comedy===
After the English Restoration of Charles II in 1660 lifted the Puritan ban on theatre, most British theatres were prohibited from performing &quot;serious&quot; drama but were permitted to show comedy or plays with music. Charles II issued letters patent to permit only two London theatre companies to perform &quot;serious&quot; drama. These were the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and Lisle&#x27;s Tennis Court in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, the latter of which moved to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in 1720 (now the Royal Opera House). The two patent theatres closed in the summer months. To fill the gap, the Theatre Royal, Haymarket became a third patent theatre in London in 1766. 

Further letters patent were eventually granted to one theatre in each of several other English towns and cities. Other theatres presented dramas that were underscored with music and, borrowing the French term, called it melodrama to get around the restriction. The Theatres Act 1843 finally allowed all theatres to play drama.

=== 19th century: operetta, incidental music, and salon entertainment ===
In the early 19th century, opera&#x27;s influence led to musical overtures and incidental music for many plays. In 1820, Franz Schubert wrote a melodrama, &quot;Die Zauberharfe&quot; (&quot;The Magic Harp&quot;), setting music behind the play written by G. von Hofmann. It was unsuccessful, like all Schubert&#x27;s theatre ventures, but the melodrama genre was at the time a popular one. In an age of underpaid musicians, many 19th-century plays in London had an orchestra in the pit. In 1826, Felix Mendelssohn wrote his well-known overture to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and later supplied the play with incidental music.

In Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La Traviata&quot;, Violetta receives a letter from Alfredo&#x27;s father where he writes that Alfredo now knows why she parted from him and that he forgives her (&quot;Teneste la promessa...&quot;). In her speaking voice, she intones the words of what is written, while the orchestra recapitulates the music of their first love from Act I: this is technically melodrama. In a few moments, Violetta bursts into a passionate despairing aria (&quot;Addio, del passato&quot;): this is opera again.

In a similar manner, Victorians often added &quot;incidental music&quot; under the dialogue to a pre-existing play, although this style of composition was already practiced in the days of Ludwig van Beethoven (&quot;Egmont&quot;) and Franz Schubert (&quot;Rosamunde&quot;). (This type of often-lavish production is now mostly limited to film (see film score) due to the cost of hiring an orchestra. Modern recording technology is producing a certain revival of the practice in theatre, but not on the former scale.) A particularly complete version of this form, Sullivan&#x27;s incidental music to Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Foresters&quot;, is available online, complete with several melodramas, for instance, No. 12 found here. A few operettas exhibit melodrama in the sense of music played under spoken dialogue, for instance, Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (itself a parody of melodramas in the modern sense) has a short &quot;melodrame&quot; (reduced to dialogue alone in many productions) in the second act; Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; opens with a melodrama delivered by the character of &quot;Public Opinion&quot;; and other pieces from operetta and musicals may be considered melodramas, such as the &quot;Recit and Minuet&quot; in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. As an example from the American musical, several long speeches in Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Brigadoon&quot; are delivered over an accompaniment of evocative music. The technique is also frequently used in Spanish zarzuela, both in the 19th and 20th centuries, and continued also to be used as a &quot;special effect&quot; in opera, for instance Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;.

In Paris, the 19th century saw a flourishing of melodrama in the many theatres that were located on the popular Boulevard du Crime, especially in the Gaîté. All this came to an end, however, when most of these theatres were demolished during the rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann in 1862.

By the end of the 19th century, the term melodrama had nearly exclusively narrowed down to a specific genre of salon entertainment: more or less rhythmically spoken words (often poetry) – not sung, sometimes more or less enacted, at least with some dramatic structure or plot – synchronized to the accompaniment of music (usually piano). It was looked down on as a genre for authors and composers of lesser stature (probably also why virtually no realizations of the genre are still remembered) - though there are examples by Robert Schumann (&quot;Ballads for Declaration&quot;, 1850s) and Richard Strauss for narrator and piano (&quot;Enoch Arden&quot; (1897). The English composer Stanley Hawley made many such settings, some of which were performed at the first season of the Henry Wood Proms in London. It was probably also at this time when the connotation of cheap overacting first became associated with the term. As a cross-over genre-mixing narration and chamber music, it was eclipsed nearly overnight by a single composition: Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot; (1912), where Sprechgesang was used instead of rhythmically spoken words, and which took a freer and more imaginative course regarding the plot prerogative.

===Czech===
Within the context of the Czech National Revival, the melodrama took on a specifically nationalist meaning for Czech artists, beginning roughly in the 1870s and continuing through the First Czechoslovak Republic of the interwar period. This new understanding of the melodrama stemmed primarily from such nineteenth-century scholars and critics as Otakar Hostinský, who considered the genre to be a uniquely &quot;Czech&quot; contribution to music history (based on the national origins of Georg Benda, whose melodramas had nevertheless been in German). Such sentiments provoked a large number of Czech composers to produce melodramas based on Czech romantic poetry, such as the &quot;Kytice&quot; of Karel Jaromír Erben. 

The romantic composer Zdeněk Fibich in particular championed the genre as a means of setting Czech declamation correctly: his melodramas &quot;Štědrý den&quot; (1874) and &quot;Vodník&quot; (1883) use rhythmic durations to specify the alignment of spoken word and accompaniment. Fibich&#x27;s main achievement was &quot;Hippodamie&quot; (1888–1891), a trilogy of full-evening staged melodramas on the texts of Jaroslav Vrchlický with multiple actors and orchestra, composed in an advanced Wagnerian musical style. Josef Suk&#x27;s main contributions at the turn of the century include melodramas for two-stage plays by Julius Zeyer: &quot;Radúz a Mahulena&quot; (1898) and &quot;Pod Jabloní&quot; (1901), both of which had a long performance history.

Following the examples of Fibich and Suk, many other Czech composers set melodramas as stand-alone works based on the poetry of the National Revival, among them Karel Kovařovic, Otakar Ostrčil, Ladislav Vycpálek, Otakar Jeremiáš, Emil Axman, and Jan Zelinka. Vítězslav Novák included portions of melodrama in his 1923 opera &quot;Lucerna&quot;, and Jaroslav Ježek composed key scenes for the stage plays of the Osvobozené divadlo as melodrama (most notably the opening prologue of the anti-Fascist farce &quot;Osel a stín&quot; (1933), delivered by the character of Dionysus in bolero rhythm). Czech melodramas&#x27; practice tapered off after the Nazi Protectorate.

=== Victorian ===
The Victorian stage melodrama featured six stock characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent, a sidekick, and a servant of the aged parent engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes at the end to ensure the triumph of good over evil. Two central features were the coup de théàtre, or reversal of fortune, and the claptrap: a back-to-the-wall oration by the hero which &quot;forces&quot; the audience to applaud.

English melodrama evolved from the tradition of populist drama established during the Middle Ages by mystery and morality plays, under influences from Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte as well as German &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; drama and Parisian melodrama of the post-Revolutionary period. A notable French melodramatist was Pixérécourt whose &quot;La Femme à deux maris&quot; was very popular.

The first English play to be called a melodrama or &#x27;melodrame&#x27; was &quot;A Tale of Mystery&quot; (1802) by Thomas Holcroft. This was an example of the Gothic genre, a previous theatrical example of which was &quot;The Castle Spectre&quot; (1797) by Matthew Gregory Lewis. Other Gothic melodramas include &quot;The Miller and his Men&quot; (1813) by Isaac Pocock, &quot;The Woodsman&#x27;s Hut&quot; (1814) by Samuel Arnold and &quot;The Broken Sword&quot; (1816) by William Dimond.

Supplanting the Gothic, the next popular subgenre was the nautical melodrama, pioneered by Douglas Jerrold in his &quot;Black-Eyed Susan&quot; (1829). Other nautical melodramas included Jerrold&#x27;s &quot;The Mutiny at the Nore&quot; (1830) and &quot;The Red Rover&quot; (1829) by Edward Fitzball (Rowell 1953). Melodramas based on urban situations became popular in the mid-nineteenth century, including &quot;The Streets of London&quot; (1864) by Dion Boucicault; and &quot;Lost in London&quot; (1867) by Watts Phillips, while prison melodrama, temperance melodrama, and imperialist melodrama also appeared – the latter typically featuring the three categories of the &#x27;good&#x27; native, the brave but wicked native, and the treacherous native.

The sensation novels of the 1860s, and 1870s not only provided fertile material for melodramatic adaptations but are melodramatic in their own right. A notable example of this genre is &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot; by Elizabeth Braddon adapted, in two different versions, by George Roberts and C.H. Hazlewood. The novels of Wilkie Collins have the characteristics of melodrama, his best-known work &quot;The Woman in White&quot; being regarded by some modern critics as &quot;the most brilliant melodrama of the period&quot;.
The villain is often the central character in melodrama, and crime was a favorite theme. This included dramatizations of the murderous careers of Burke and Hare, Sweeney Todd (first featured in &quot;The String of Pearls&quot; (1847) by George Dibdin Pitt), the murder of Maria Marten in the Red Barn and the bizarre exploits of Spring Heeled Jack. The misfortunes of a discharged prisoner are the theme of the sensational &quot;The Ticket-of-Leave Man&quot; (1863) by Tom Taylor.

Early silent films, such as &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; had similar themes. Later, after silent films were superseded by the &#x27;talkies&#x27;, stage actor Tod Slaughter, at the age of 50, transferred to the screen the Victorian melodramas in which he had played a villain in his earlier theatrical career. These films, which include &quot;Maria Marten or Murder in the Red Barn&quot; (1935), &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Ticket of Leave Man&quot; (1937) are a unique record of a bygone art-form.

==Generic offshoots==
* Northrop Frye saw both advertising and propaganda as melodramatic forms which the cultivated cannot take seriously.
* Politics at the time calls on melodrama to articulate a world-view. Thus Richard Overy argues that 1930s Britain saw civilization as melodramatically under threat - &quot;In this great melodrama Hitler&#x27;s Germany was the villain; democratic civilization the menaced heroine&quot;; - while Winston Churchill provided the necessary larger-than-life melodramatic hero to articulate back-to-the-wall resistance during The Blitz.

=== Modern ===
Classic melodrama is less common than it used to be on television and in movies in the Western world. However, it is still widely popular in other regions, particularly in Asia and in Hispanic countries. Melodrama is one of the main genres (along with romance, comedy and fantasy) used in Latin American television dramas (telenovelas), particularly in Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil, and in Asian television dramas, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, Pakistan, Thailand, India, Turkey and (in a fusion of the Hispanic and Asian cultures) the Philippines. Expatriate communities in the diaspora of these countries give viewership a global market.

=== Film ===

In film studies and criticism, melodrama may variously refer to a genre, mode, style or sensibility characterized by its emphasis on intense and exaggerated emotions and heightened dramatic situations. There is no fixed definition of the term and it may be used to refer to a wide and diverse range of films of other genres including romantic dramas, historical dramas, psychological thrillers or crime thrillers, among others.

Feminists have noted four categories of themes in the film melodrama: those with a female patient, a maternal figure, an &quot;impossible love&quot;, and the paranoid melodrama. Most film melodramas from the 1930s and 1940s, at the time known as &quot;weepies&quot; or &quot;tearjerkers&quot;, were adaptations of women&#x27;s fiction, such as romance novels and historical romances. Drawing from a shared history with women&#x27;s fiction, melodramatic films often concentrate on female perspectives and desires. From the 1930s until the late 1960s, Hays Code restrictions on the inclusion of &quot;licentious&quot; content in films would restrict the portrayal of female desire in the American film melodrama.

During the 1940s, the British Gainsborough melodramas were successful with audiences.

In the 1950s, films by director Douglas Sirk, such as &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955) and &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956), are representative of the genre. Many later melodramatic filmmakers cite Sirk and his works as significant influences. 

In the 1970s, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who was influenced by Sirk, contributed to the genre by engaging with issues within the cultural subconscious, addressing class in &quot;The Merchant of Four Seasons&quot; (1971) and &quot;Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven&quot; (1975), sexual orientation and codependency in &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot; (1972) and racism, xenophobia, and ageism in &quot;Fear Eats the Soul&quot; (1974). 

The 1980s saw a resurgence in American &quot;women&#x27;s&quot; melodramas such as &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), &quot;Beaches&quot; (1988), and &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989). On television, the miniseries was a popular format for lavish, female-centric melodramas such as &quot;Scruples&quot; (1980), &quot;Lace&quot; (1984), and &quot;Sins&quot; (1986). 

Melodramas like the 1990s TV &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; movies targeted audiences of American women by portraying the effects of alcoholism, domestic violence, rape and the like. Typical of the 90&#x27;s melodrama is Anjelica Huston&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Agnes Browne&quot;. 

Todd Haynes&#x27; films &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002), &quot;Carol&quot; (2015), and &quot;May December&quot; (2023) are more recent takes on the melodrama. Contemporary director Pedro Almodovar has also taken many inspirations from the melodramatic genre and directors like Sirk.

<text>The Palmer Method of penmanship instruction was developed and promoted by Austin Palmer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was intended to simplify the earlier &quot;Spencerian method&quot;, which had been the main handwriting learning method since the 1840s. The Palmer Method soon became the most popular handwriting system in the United States.

Under the method, students were taught to adopt a uniform system of cursive writing with rhythmic motions.

==History==

The method developed around 1888 and was introduced in the book &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Guide to Business Writing&quot; (1894). Palmer&#x27;s method involved &quot;muscle motion&quot; in which the more proximal muscles of the arm were used for movement, rather than allowing the fingers to move in writing. In spite of opposition from the major publishers, this textbook enjoyed great success: in 1912, one million copies were sold throughout the United States. The method won awards, including the Gold Medal at the Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, in 1915, and the Gold Medal at the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia, in 1926.

Proponents of the Palmer Method emphasized its plainness and speed, that it was much faster than the laborious Spencerian Method, and that it allowed the writer to compete effectively with the typewriter. To educators, the method&#x27;s advocates emphasized regimentation, and that the method would thus be useful in schools to increase discipline and character, and could even reform delinquents.

The Palmer Method began to fall out of popularity in the 1950s and was eventually supplanted by the Zaner-Bloser Method, which sought to teach children print writing (also called &quot;manuscript printing&quot;) before teaching them cursive, in order to provide them with a means of written expression as soon as possible, and thus develop writing skills. The D&#x27;Nealian Method, introduced in 1978, sought to address problems raised by the Zaner-Bloser Method, returning to a more cursive style of print writing. The Palmer company stopped publishing in the 1980s.

==Legacy==
In radar engineering, a Palmer Scan is a scanning technique that produces a scanning beam by moving the main antenna and its feed in a circular motion. The name was derived from the looping circles practiced by students of the Palmer Method.

<doc id="254712" wikidata="Q3505980" url="?curid=254712" title="Novotny (chess)">
<text>The Novotny (also often spelled as Nowotny, even in non-German sources) is a device found in chess problems named after a problem from 1854 by Antonín Novotný, though the first example was composed by Henry Turton in 1851. A piece is sacrificed on a square where it could be taken by two different opposing pieces (almost invariably a rook and bishop), but whichever makes the capture, it interferes with the other. It is essentially a Grimshaw brought about by a sacrifice on the critical square.

This pattern can arise as part of a combination in an actual game, but it is extremely rare (see games below). Most chess players would not use the term &quot;Novotny&quot; to describe such a move, since that term is almost exclusively used in the context of chess problems.

==Examples==

===Basic===
The device can be understood by reference to the problem shown here, a mate in two moves (white moves first, and must checkmate black in two moves against any defence). The key (first move of the solution; see Glossary of chess problems) is 1.Nb2 (see algebraic notation). This interferes with black&#x27;s rook and bishop, and whichever of those pieces takes the knight, it will interfere with the other—this is the Novotny idea at its most basic. So, if black plays 1...Bxb2, this interferes with his rook and allows 2.Qf2#, while if he plays 1...Rxb2, it is the bishop that is interfered with, allowing 2.Qd4#.

Problemists would generally agree that a single Novotny with no other play, as in this example, makes for a relatively uninteresting problem. Usually, Novotnys are combined in problems with other ideas, or several Novotnys are shown in a single problem.
===Multiple Novotnys===
The problem as shown here is very well known. It contains no fewer than six separate Novotnys. It is by R. C. O. Matthews, was published in the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; in 1957 and won the Brian Harley Award. It is a mate in 3.

The key is 1.b4, threatening 2.Bxb1 and 3.Ra3#. Black has six thematic defences, each of which White meets with a Novotny on move two:

*1...Bb6 threatens 2...Ba5, interfering with the path of the white rook to a3. White counters with a Novotny interference: 2.Rd5. This interferes with the black rook on h5 and the bishop on a8, and so threatens 3.Nb5# and 3.Ne4#. Black can prevent one by capturing on d5, but not both, because the capturing piece interferes with the other (so 2...Rxd5 3.Ne4#; or 2...Bxd5 3.Nb5#).
*1...Rbxb5 threatens 2...Ra5 stopping the threat. White can now play 2.Qd5 with the same interferences and threats as follow 1...Bb6.
*1...Bc5 threatens 2...Bxb4 to defend a3, stopping White&#x27;s threat. White counters with 2.Rb7, interfering with the bishop on a8 and the rook on b8 and leading to the same threats and comparable continuations as follow 1...Bb6 (additionally, 2...Bxd6 allows 3.Bxd4#).
*1...Bb7 threatens to capture the white rook which would give mate. White can now play 2.Rc5 interfering with the bishop on a7 and the rook on h5, and so threatening 3.Nb5# and 3.Bxd4#. As before, a capture on c5 stops one of the threats, but not both.
*1...Bd5 threatens 2...Bxc4, after which Black could meet white&#x27;s threatened 3.Ra3 with 3...Bb3. White instead plays 2.Rbb6 with the same threats and variations as follow 1...Bb7.
*1...Rhxb5 threatens 2...Ra5, stopping the threat. White instead plays 2.Rb6 with the same threats and variations as follow 1...Bb7.

The solution, in short form, is thus:
1. b4
*1...Bb6 2. Rd5
*1...Rbxb5 2. Qd5
*1...Bc5 2. Rb7
*1...Bb7 2. Rc5
*1...Bd5 2. Rbb6
*1...Rhxb5 2. Rb6

Four of White&#x27;s Novotnys in these variations are executed by the rook on b5—only the rook will do in those variations, because the square it comes from, b5, must be vacated for the white knight to deliver mate. In the other two lines, that rook is captured, meaning it cannot execute the Novotny, but also meaning the square vacation is no longer necessary (the white knight can simply capture the black piece on b5). Therefore, another piece can make the Novotny interference in those lines. (There is one other non-thematic defence in the problem: 1...Nd2, threatening a nuisance check on b3. This allows 2.Ra3+ Nb3+ 3.Rxb3#.)
===As part of a larger scheme===
Many problems include a Novotny as part of some larger scheme. The problem here, by Milan Vukcevich, published in &quot;Schach-Echo&quot; in 1976, includes a Novotny as just one part of a more complex problem. It is a mate in 2. The key is 1.Qd6, which is a Novotny interference with the black rook and bishop on b8, so threatening 2.Ne5# and 2.Nxd2#. After the capture of the queen by the rook or bishop, the other black piece is still interfered with by the capturing unit; so 1...Rxd6 rules out 2.Nxd2 but still allows 2.Ne5#, while 1...Bxd6 rules out 2.Ne5 but allows 2.Nxd2#. Just as these Novotny lines work as a pair, so the other black defences work in pairs:

:1...Rxa7 (removes white guard of e3) 2.Qd3#
:1...Bxa7 (removes white guard of e3) 2.Qf4#
:1...e5 (pins the knight that gives the mate in the Novotny lines) 2.Qf6#
:1...Bd5 (pins the knight) 2.Qxa3# (not otherwise possible because of 2...Rd3)
===The Novotny theme in practical play===
The Novotny theme occurs extremely rarely in actual play. The strong English master Amos Burn produced such an example in an offhand game in 1910 (see diagram). In a seemingly desperate position, with his king apparently about to fall to a powerful attack by White&#x27;s pieces, Burn played 33...Qg4!! The point is that if the bishop or pawn takes the queen, the white rook&#x27;s pin on the black bishop is lifted, allowing 34...Bxd2; if the rook takes the queen, the white bishop no longer protects f3, so Black can play the royal fork 34...Nf3+ and 35...Nxd2. Finally, if 34.Qxg5+, Qxg5 35.Rxg5+ Kh6 (a king fork) wins a piece. Burn won in 15 more moves and was to comment afterwards that his 33...Qg4 demonstrated that there is an element of luck in chess.


In this position, from Rubtsova-Belova, USSR 1945, White has just played the attractive-looking 1.Rf4-g4? Black cannot capture the rook (1...Qxg4? 2.Bxg4; 1...fxg4?? 2.Qxg5), and White would win a piece after 1...Qf6? 2.Rxg3. However, Black responded with a decisive Novotny, 1...Ne2+! This enables Black to win the rook after 2.Rxe2 Qxg4; 2.Bxe2 Qxe3+ and 3...fxg4; or 2.Kf1 Qxg4. Black won.


The Novotny theme could also have occurred in actual play in E. Berg-J. Zezulkin, Rowy 2000. From this diagram, White could have won with 40.Nf6!! (instead of 40.Qe6?, leading to an eventual draw). After 40.Nf6!!, White would threaten the two thematical mates 41.Qg7# and 41.Qf8# and in addition 41.Rg8# and 41.Qxh7#. Now 40...Bxf6 would block Black&#x27;s rook, allowing 41.Qf8#, while 40...Rxf6 would block Black&#x27;s bishop, allowing 41.Qg7#. After 40...Qxh6 which parries both thematical threats White has 41.Rg8#.

The Novotny theme was played in David Navara vs Anna Dergatschova-Daus, Ordix Open (2007), Mainz, 2007. If White could check on the a2–g8 diagonal, it would force mate quickly. But the R guards e6, and the B guards d5. So 36. Rc6!! intersects both lines: 36... Rxc6 37.Qd5+ Re6 38.Qxe6#, or 36... Bxc6 37.Qe6#; and if 36... Qxc6 then 37. e8=Q+ Qxe8 38. Qxe8#

<doc id="254713" wikidata="Q574816" url="?curid=254713" title="Agar plate">
<text>An agar plate is a Petri dish that contains a growth medium solidified with agar, used to culture microorganisms. Sometimes selective compounds are added to influence growth, such as antibiotics.

Individual microorganisms placed on the plate will grow into individual colonies, each a clone genetically identical to the individual ancestor organism (except for the low, unavoidable rate of mutation). Thus, the plate can be used either to estimate the concentration of organisms in a liquid culture or a suitable dilution of that culture using a colony counter, or to generate genetically pure cultures from a mixed culture of genetically different organisms.

Several methods are available to plate out cells. One technique is known as &quot;streaking&quot;. In this technique, a drop of the culture on the end of a thin, sterile loop of wire, sometimes known as an inoculator, is streaked across the surface of the agar leaving organisms behind, a higher number at the beginning of the streak and a lower number at the end. At some point during a successful &quot;streak&quot;, the number of organisms deposited will be such that distinct individual colonies will grow in that area which may be removed for further culturing, using another sterile loop.

Another way of plating organisms, next to streaking, on agar plates is the spot analysis. This type of analysis is often used to check the viability of cells and is performed with pinners (often also called froggers). A third technique is using sterile glass beads to plate out cells. In this technique, cells are grown in a liquid culture, in which a small volume is pipetted on the agar plate and then spread out with the beads. Replica plating is another technique used to plate out cells on agar plates. These four techniques are the most common, but others are also possible. It is crucial to work in a sterile manner to prevent contamination on the agar plates. Plating is thus often done in a laminar flow cabinet or on the working bench next to a bunsen burner.

== History ==
In 1881, Fanny Hesse, who was working as a technician for her husband Walther Hesse in the laboratory of Robert Koch, suggested agar as an effective setting agent, since it had been commonplace in jam making for some time.

== Types ==
Like other growth media, the formulations of agar used in plates may be classified as either &quot;defined&quot; or &quot;undefined&quot;; a defined medium is synthesized from individual chemicals required by the organism so the exact molecular composition is known, whereas an undefined medium is made from natural products such as yeast extract, where the precise composition is unknown.

Agar plates may be formulated as either permissive, with the intent of allowing the growth of whatever organisms are present, or restrictive or selective, with the intent of only allowing the growth of a particular subset of those organisms. This may take the form of a nutritional requirement, for instance providing a particular compound such as lactose as the only source of carbon and thereby selecting only organisms which can metabolize that compound, or by including a particular antibiotic or other substance to select only organisms which are resistant to that substance. This correlates to some degree with defined and undefined media; undefined media, made from natural products and containing an unknown combination of very many organic molecules, is typically more permissive in terms of supplying the needs of a wider variety of organisms. In contrast, defined media can be precisely tailored to select organisms with specific properties.

Agar plates may also be indicator plates, in which the organisms are not selected based on growth, but are instead distinguished by a color change in some colonies, typically caused by the action of an enzyme on some compound added to the medium.

The plates are incubated for 12 hours up to several days, depending on the test that is performed.

Commonly used types of agar plates include:
=== Blood agar ===
====Blood agar plate====
Blood agar plates (BAPs) contain mammalian blood (usually sheep or horse), typically at a 5–10% concentration. BAPs are enriched, and differential media is used to isolate fastidious organisms and detect hemolytic activity. β-Hemolytic activity will show lysis and complete digestion of red blood cell contents surrounding a colony. Examples include &quot;Streptococcus haemolyticus&quot;. α-Hemolysis will only cause partial lysis of the red blood cells (the cell membrane is left intact) and appear green or brown due to the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. An example of this would be &quot;Streptococcus viridans&quot;. γ-Hemolysis (or nonhemolytic) is the term referring to a lack of hemolytic activity. BAPs also contain meat extract or yeast extract, tryptone, sodium chloride, and agar.

====Chocolate agar====
Chocolate agar is a type of blood agar plate in which the blood cells have been lysed by heating the cells to 80 °C. It is used for growing fastidious respiratory bacteria, such as &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. Chocolate agar is named for its color, and no chocolate is contained in the plate.

====Thayer–Martin agar====
Thayer–Martin agar is a chocolate agar designed to isolate &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; and &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;.

==== Thiosulfate–citrate–bile salts–sucrose agar ====
Thiosulfate–citrate–bile salts–sucrose agar enhances growth of &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp., including &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;.

=== General bacterial media ===

* Bile esculin agar is used for the isolation of &quot;Enterococcus&quot; and group D &quot;Streptococcus&quot; species.
* CLED agar – cysteine, lactose, electrolyte-deficient agar is used to isolate and differentiate urinary tract bacteria, since it inhibits &quot;Proteus&quot; species swarming and can distinguish between lactose fermenters and nonfermenters.
* Granada medium is used to isolate and differentiate group B &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot; from clinical samples. It grows in Granada medium as red colonies, and most of the accompanying bacteria are inhibited.
* Hektoen enteric agar is designed to isolate and recover fecal bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is particularly useful in isolating &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Shigella&quot;.
* Lysogeny broth is used to culture &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.
* MacConkey agar is a selective and differential medium used to differentiate between gram-negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria. Adding bile salts and crystal violet to the agar inhibits the growth of most gram-positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. Lactose and neutral red are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies. An alternative medium, eosin methylene blue serves a similar purpose.
* Mannitol salt agar is also a selective and differential medium. The mannitol indicates organisms that ferment mannitol: mannitol fermentation produces lactic acid, lowering the pH and turning the plate yellow. The salt is to select for halophiles; organisms that cannot withstand a high salt content are unable to grow well.
* Mueller–Hinton agar contains beef infusion, peptone, and starch, and is used primarily for antibiotic susceptibility testing. It can be in a form of blood agar.
* Nutrient agar is usually used for growth of nonfastidious organisms and observation of pigment production. It is safe to use in school science laboratories because it does not selectively grow pathogenic bacteria.
* Önöz agar allows more rapid bacteriological diagnosis, as &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Shigella&quot; colonies can be clearly and reliably differentiated from other Enterobacteriaceae. The yields of &quot;Salmonella&quot; from stool samples obtained, when using this medium, are higher than those obtained with LEIFSON agar or &quot;Salmonella–Shigella&quot; agar.
* Phenylethyl alcohol agar selects for &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species while inhibiting Gram-negative bacilli (e.g., &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot;, &quot;Proteus&quot;, etc.).
* R2A agar, a nonspecific medium, imitates water, so is used for water analysis.
* Tryptic (trypticase) soy agar (TSA) is a general-purpose medium produced by enzymatic digestion of soybean meal and casein. It is frequently the base medium of other agar types; for example, blood agar plates are made by enriching TSA plates with blood. TSA plates support growth of many semifastidious bacteria, including some species of &quot;Brucella&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, &quot;Listeria&quot;, &quot;Neisseria&quot;, and &quot;Vibrio&quot;.
* Xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agar is used for the culture of stool samples and contains two indicators. It is formulated to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria, while the growth of Gram-negative bacilli is encouraged. The colonies of lactose fermenters appear yellow. It is also used to culture possible &quot;Salmonella&quot; that may be present in a food sample. Most &quot;Salmonella&quot; colonies produce a black centre on it.
* Cetrimide agar is used for the selective isolation of the Gram-negative bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;.
* Tinsdale agar contains potassium tellurite, which can isolate &quot;Corynebacterium diphteriae&quot;.

=== Fungal media ===
* Sabouraud agar is used to culture fungi and has a low pH that inhibits the growth of most bacteria; it also contains the antibiotic gentamicin to specifically inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria.
* Hay infusion agar is specific for the culturing of slime moulds (which are not fungi).
* Potato dextrose agar is used to culture certain types of fungi.
* Malt extract agar has a high content of peptone and is acidic. It is essentially used in the isolation of fungal microorganisms.
* MMN (Modified Melin-Norkrans) medium and BAF medium are used for ectomycorrhizal fungi.
* &quot;Chromogenic agars&quot; can distinguish some major types of fungal infection.

=== Moss media ===

* Knop agar is used to axenically culture protonema and whole moss plants, such as those of &quot;Physcomitrella patens&quot;, a model organism.

=== Yeast media ===

* YEPD media is often used as a general growth media for yeasts like &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Candida albicans&quot;
* Sporulation medium is medium used when spores have to be formed. It can also be used when working with fungi or bacteria depending on whether or not the strain is capable of forming spores.

=== Mega Plate ===
* A 2&#x27; x 4&#x27; petri plate filled with 14L (liters) of seaweed derived agar medium created by Harvard scientists that was used to see how &quot;E. coli&quot; evolved to be resistant to antibiotics. The mega plate also helped study more unique concepts of microbiology such as parallel evolution, mutation selection, colonial interference etc.

<text>Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections. This may include bone infections, endocarditis, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis among others. It is not effective for gonorrhea or chlamydia infections. It can be given intravenously, by intramuscular injection, or topically. Topical formulations may be used in burns or for infections of the outside of the eye. It is often only used for two days until bacterial cultures determine what specific antibiotics the infection is sensitive to. The dose required should be monitored by blood testing.
Gentamicin can cause inner ear problems and kidney problems. The inner ear problems can include problems with balance and hearing loss. These problems may be permanent. If used during pregnancy, it can cause harm to the developing fetus. However, it appears to be safe for use during breastfeeding. Gentamicin is a type of aminoglycoside and works by disrupting the ability of the bacteria to make proteins, which typically kills the bacteria.
Gentamicin is naturally produced by the bacterium &quot;Micromonospora purpurea&quot;, was patented in 1962, approved for medical use in 1964. The antibiotic is collected from the culture of the &quot;Micromonospora&quot; by perforating the cell wall of the bacterium. Current research is underway to understand the biosynthesis of this antibiotic in an attempt to increase expression and force secretion of gentamicin for higher titer. Gentamicin is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies gentamicin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Gentamicin is active against a wide range of bacterial infections, mostly Gram-negative bacteria including &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Proteus&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Enterobacter aerogenes&quot;, &quot;Serratia&quot;, and the Gram-positive &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;. Gentamicin is used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, blood, bone and soft tissue infections of these susceptible bacteria.

There is insufficient evidence to support gentamicin as the first line treatment of &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; infection. Gentamicin is not used for &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; or &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot; bacterial infections (because of the risk of the person going into shock from lipid A endotoxin found in certain Gram-negative organisms). Gentamicin is also useful against &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; (responsible for plague), its relatives, and &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot; (the organism responsible for tularemia often seen in hunters and trappers).

Some &quot;Enterobacteriaceae&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas spp.&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus spp.&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and other &quot;Staphylococcus spp.&quot; have varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin.
===Special populations===
====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
Gentamicin is not recommended in pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the risks for the mother. Gentamicin can cross the placenta and several reports of irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children have been seen. Intramuscular injection of gentamicin in mothers can cause muscle weakness in the newborn.

The safety and efficacy for gentamicin in nursing mothers has not been established. Detectable gentamicin levels are found in human breast milk and in nursing babies.

====Elderly====
In the elderly, renal function should be assessed before beginning therapy as well as during treatment due to a decline in glomerular filtration rate. Gentamicin levels in the body can remain higher for a longer period of time in this population. Gentamicin should be used cautiously in persons with renal, auditory, vestibular, or neuromuscular dysfunction.

====Children====
Gentamicin may not be appropriate to use in children, including babies. Studies have shown higher serum levels and a longer half-life in this population. Kidney function should be checked periodically during therapy. Long-term effects of treatment can include hearing loss and balance problems. Hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and muscle weakness have been reported when used by injection.

==Contraindications==
Gentamicin should not be used if a person has a history of hypersensitivity, such as anaphylaxis, or other serious toxic reaction to gentamicin or any other aminoglycosides. Greater care is required in people with myasthenia gravis and other neuromuscular disorders as there is a risk of worsening weakness. Gentamicin should also be avoided when prescribing empirical antibiotics in the setting of possible infant botulism (Ampicillin with Gentamicin is commonly used as empiric therapy in infants) also due to worsening of neuromuscular function.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of gentamicin can range from less severe reactions, such as nausea and vomiting, to more severe reactions including:
* Low blood cell counts
* Allergic reactions 
* Neuromuscular problems
* Nerve damage (neuropathy)
* Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
* Ear disorders (ototoxicity)
Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are thought to be dose related with higher doses causing greater chance of toxicity. These two toxicities may have delayed presentation, sometimes not appearing until after completing treatment.

===Kidney damage===
Kidney damage is a problem in 10–25% of people who receive aminoglycosides, and gentamicin is one of the most nephrotoxic drugs of this class. Oftentimes, acute nephrotoxicity is reversible, but it may be fatal. The risk of nephrotoxicity can be affected by the dose, frequency, duration of therapy, and concurrent use of certain medications, such as NSAIDs, diuretics, cisplatin, ciclosporin, cephalosporins, amphotericin, iodide contrast media, and vancomycin.

Factors that increase risk of nephrotoxicity include:
* Increased age
* Reduced renal function
* Pregnancy
* Hypothyroidism
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Volume depletion
* Metabolic acidosis
* Sodium depletion
Kidney dysfunction is monitored by measuring creatinine in the blood, electrolyte levels, urine output, presence of protein in the urine, and concentrations of other chemicals, such as urea, in the blood.

===Inner ear===
About 11% of the population who receives aminoglycosides experience damage to their inner ear. The common symptoms of inner ear damage include tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, trouble with coordination, and dizziness. Chronic use of gentamicin can affect two areas of the ears. First, damage of the inner ear hair cells can result in irreversible hearing loss. Second, damage to the inner ear vestibular apparatus can lead to balance problems. To reduce the risk of ototoxicity during treatment, it is recommended to stay hydrated.

Factors that increase the risk of inner ear damage include:
* Increased age
* High blood uric acid levels
* Kidney dysfunction
* Liver dysfunction 
* Higher doses 
* Long courses of therapy
* Also taking strong diuretics (e.g., furosemide)

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Gentamicin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, negatively impacting protein synthesis. The primary mechanism of action is generally accepted to work through ablating the ability of the ribosome to discriminate on proper transfer RNA and messenger RNA interactions. Typically, if an incorrect tRNA pairs with an mRNA codon at the aminoacyl site of the ribosome, adenosines 1492 and 1493 are excluded from the interaction and retract, signaling the ribosome to reject the aminoacylated tRNA::Elongation Factor Thermo-Unstable complex. However, when gentamicin binds at helix 44 of the 16S rRNA, it forces the adenosines to maintain the position they take when there is a correct, or cognate, match between aa-tRNA and mRNA. This leads to the acceptance of incorrect aa-tRNAs, causing the ribosome to synthesize proteins with wrong amino acids placed throughout (roughly every 1 in 500). The non-functional, mistranslated proteins misfold and aggregate, eventually leading to death of the bacterium. Moreover, it has been observed that gentamicin can cause a substantial slowdown in the overall elongation rate of peptide chains in live bacterial cells, independent of the misincorporation of amino acids. This finding indicates that gentamicin not only induces errors in protein synthesis but also broadly hampers the efficiency of the translation process itself. An additional mechanism has been proposed based on crystal structures of gentamicin in a secondary binding site at helix 69 of the 23S rRNA, which interacts with helix 44 and proteins that recognize stop codons. At this secondary site, gentamicin is believed to preclude interactions of the ribosome with ribosome recycling factors, causing the two subunits of the ribosome to stay complexed even after translation completes, creating a pool of inactive ribosomes that can no longer re-initiate and translate new proteins.

==Chemistry==
=== Structure ===

Since gentamicin is derived from the species &quot;Micromonospora&quot;, the backbone for this antibiotic is the aminocyclitol 2-deoxystreptamine. This six carbon ring is substituted at the carbon positions 4 and 6 by the amino sugar molecules cyclic purpurosamine and garosamine, respectively. The gentamicin complex, is differentiated into five major components (C1, C1a, C2, C2a, C2b) and multiple minor components by substitution at the 6&#x27; carbon of the purpurosamine unit indicated in the image to the right by R1 and R2. The R1 and R2 can have the follow substitutions for some of the species in the gentamicin complex.

Gentamicins consist of three hexosamines: gentosamine/garosamine, 2-deoxystreptamine, and purpurosamine (see illustrations, from left to right).

Kanamycins and tobramycin exhibit similar structures. Sisomicin is 4,5-dehydrogentamicin-C1a.

===Components===
Gentamicin is composed of a number of related gentamicin components and fractions which have varying degrees of antimicrobial potency. The main components of gentamicin include members of the gentamicin C complex: gentamicin C1, gentamicin C1a, and gentamicin C2 which compose approximately 80% of gentamicin and have been found to have the highest antibacterial activity. Gentamicin A, B, X, and a few others make up the remaining 20% of gentamicin and have lower antibiotic activity than the gentamicin C complex. The exact composition of a given sample or lot of gentamicin is not well defined, and the level of gentamicin C components or other components in gentamicin may differ from lot-to-lot depending on the gentamicin manufacturer or manufacturing process. Because of this lot-to-lot variability, it can be difficult to study various properties of gentamicin including pharmacokinetics and microorganism susceptibility if there is an unknown combination of chemically related but different compounds.

===Biosynthesis===
The complete biosynthesis of gentamicin is not entirely elucidated. The genes controlling the biosynthesis of gentamicin are of particular interest due to the difficulty in obtaining the antibiotic after production. Since gentamicin is collected at the cell surface and the cell surface must be perforated somehow to obtain the antibiotic. Many propose the amount of gentamicin collected after production could increase if the genes are identified and re-directed to secrete the antibiotic instead of collecting gentamicin at the cell surface. Literature also agrees with the gentamicin biosynthesis pathway starting with D-Glucose-6-phosphate being dephopsphorylated, transaminated, dehydrogenated and finally glycosylated with D-glucosamine to generate paromamine inside &quot;Micromonospora echinospora&quot;. The addition of D-xylose leads to the first intermediate of the gentamicin C complex pathway, gentamicin A2. Gentamicin A2 is C-methylated and epimerized into gentamicin X2, the first branch point of this biosynthesis pathway

When X2 is acted on by the cobalamin-dependent radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine enzyme GenK, the carbon position 6&#x27; is methylated to form the pharmacologically active intermediate G418 G418 then undergoes dehydrogenation and amination at the C6&#x27; position by the dehydrogenase gene, GenQ, to generate the pharmacologically active JI-20B, although another intermediate, 6&#x27;-dehydro-6&#x27;oxo-G418 (6&#x27;DOG) is proposed to be in-between this step and for which the gene GenB1 is proposed as the aminating gene. JI-20B is dehydroxylated and epimerized to first component of the gentamicin C complex, gentamicin C2a which then undergoes an epimerization by GenB2 and then a N-methylation by an unconfirmed gene to form the final product in this branch point, gentamicin C1.

When X2 bypasses GenK and is directly dehydrogenated and aminated by the GenQ enzyme, the other pharmacologically relevant intermediate JI-20A is formed. Although, there has been identification of an intermediate for this step, 6&#x27;-dehydro-6&#x27;-oxo-gentamicin X2 (6&#x27;-DOX), for which the enzyme GenB1 is purposed as the aminating enzyme. JI-20A is then dehydroxylated into the first component of the gentamicin C complex for this branch, gentamicin C1a via a catalytic reaction with GenB4. C1a then undergoes an N-methylation by an unconfirmed enzyme to form the final component, gentamicin C2b.

====Fermentation====
Gentamicin is only synthesized via submerged fermentation and inorganic sources of nutrients have been found to reduce production. Traditional fermentation used yeast beef broth, but there has been research into optimizing the growth medium for producing gentamicin C complex due to the C complex currently being the only pharmaceutically relevant component. The main components of the growth medium are carbon sources, mainly sugars, but several studies found increased gentamicin production by adding vegetable and fish oils and decreased gentamicin production with the addition of glucose, xylose and several carboxylic acids. Tryptone and various forms of yeast and yeast derivatives are traditionally used as the nitrogen source in the growth medium, but several amino acids, soybean meal, corn steep liquor, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium chloride have proven to be beneficial additives. Phosphate ions, metal ions (cobalt and a few others at low concentration), various vitamins (mostly B vitamins), purine and pyrimidine bases are also supplemented into the growth medium to increase gentamicin production, but the margin of increase is dependent on the species of &quot;Micromonospora&quot; and the other components in the growth medium. With all of these aforementioned additives, pH and aeration are key determining factors for the amount of gentamicin produced. A range of pH from 6.8 to 7.5 is used for gentamicin biosynthesis and the aeration is determined by independent experimentation reliant on type of growth medium and species of &quot;Micromonospora&quot;.

==History==
Gentamicin is produced by the fermentation of &quot;Micromonospora purpurea&quot;. It was discovered in 1963 by Weinstein, Wagman et al. at Schering Corporation in Bloomfield, N.J. while working with source material (soil samples) provided by Rico Woyciesjes. When &quot;M. purpurea&quot; grows in culture it is a vivid purple colour similar to the colour of the dye Gentian Violet and hence this was why Gentamicin took then name it did. Subsequently, it was purified and the structures of its three components were determined by Cooper, et al., also at the Schering Corporation. It was initially used as a topical treatment for burns at burn units in Atlanta and San Antonio and was introduced into IV usage in 1971. It remains a mainstay for use in sepsis.

It is synthesized by &quot;Micromonospora&quot;, a genus of Gram-positive bacteria widely present in the environment (water and soil). According to the American Medical Association Committee on Generic Names, antibiotics not produced by &quot;Streptomyces&quot; should not use &quot;y&quot; in the ending of the name, and to highlight their specific biological origins, gentamicin and other related antibiotics produced by this genus (verdamicin, mutamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and retymicin) have their spellings ending in &quot;~micin&quot; and not in &quot;~mycin&quot;.

==Research==
Gentamicin is also used in molecular biology research as an antibacterial agent in tissue and cell culture, to prevent contamination of sterile cultures. Gentamicin is one of the few heat-stable antibiotics that remain active even after autoclaving, which makes it particularly useful in the preparation of some microbiological growth media.

<text>Jeffrey M. Shaara (born February 21, 1952) is an American novelist and the son of Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Shaara.

==Biography==
Jeffrey Shaara was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and grew up in Tallahassee, Florida. He graduated from Florida State University in 1974 with a degree in Criminology and lives in Gettysburg.

He wrote &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; and &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot;, which are the prequel and sequel, respectively, to his father Michael&#x27;s award-winning novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;. Jeff followed his father&#x27;s footsteps upon the latter&#x27;s death, writing historical fiction and documenting the American wars and their most historically relevant characters. In total, Jeff has written fifteen &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling novels.

Jeff delivered the commencement speech at the University of Delaware&#x27;s 2005 undergraduate ceremony. Jeff has deemed this &quot;one of the most important moments in his life.&quot;

He completed a trilogy in 2010 about World War II in the European and North African theaters. A fourth World War II novel, titled &quot;The Final Storm&quot;, covers the end of the war in the Pacific, and was released on May 17, 2011.

==Awards==

Shaara received the W.Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction from the American Library Association in 2022 for &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Claw&quot;, in 2018 for &quot;The Frozen Hours&quot;, in 2005 for &quot;To The Last Man: A Novel of The First World War&quot;, and in 1997 for &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. The American Library Association&#x27;s Reference and Users Services Association recognized &quot;The Steel Wave&quot; as a 2009 Notable Book.

He has also been awarded the Lincoln Forum&#x27;s Richard Nelson Current Award of Achievement, New York Civil War Round Table&#x27;s &quot;Bell I. Wiley Awar, and Florida State University&#x27;s Artes Award as a Distinguished Alumnus. In 2011, Shaara was inducted into the FSU College of Criminology Hall of Fame and awarded FSU&#x27;s first annual Distinguished Writer&#x27;s Award.

==Film adaptations==

In 2003, Warner Brothers made the major motion picture &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, which was based on his book of the same title.

<doc id="254724" wikidata="Q553220" url="?curid=254724" title="Ertapenem">
<text>Ertapenem, sold under the brand name Invanz, is a carbapenem antibiotic medication used for the treatment of infections of the abdomen, the lungs, the upper part of the female reproductive system, and the diabetic foot.

The most common side effects include diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), headache, and problems around the area where the medicine is infused. It can significantly reduce the concentrations of valproic acid, an anti-seizure medication, in the blood to the point where it loses its effectiveness.

Ertapenem was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2001, and in the European Union in April 2002. It is marketed by Merck.

==Medical uses==
Ertapenem is indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections, and diabetic foot infections, with bacteria that are susceptible to this drug, or expected to be so. It can also be used to prevent infections after colorectal surgery. In the United States it is also indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis. It is a potential effective alternative treatment for ceftriaxone-resistant gonorrhoea.

It is given as an intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection. The drug is not approved for children under three months of age.

==Contraindications==
The drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to ertapenem or other carbapenem type antibiotics, or with severe hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis or severe skin reactions) to other beta-lactam antibiotics in the past.

==Side effects==
Common side effects are diarrhoea (in 5% of people receiving ertapenem), nausea (in 3%) and vomiting, reactions at the injection site (5%, including pain and inflammation of the vein), and headache. Uncommon but possibly serious side effects include candida infections, seizures, skin reactions such as rashes (including nappy rash in children), and anaphylaxis. Hypersensitivity cross-reactions with penicillins are rare.

Ertapenem also can have an effect on some blood tests such as liver enzymes and platelet count.

==Overdose==
Overdosing is unlikely. In adults receiving the threefold therapeutic dose over eight days, no significant toxicity was observed.

== Interactions ==

Ertapenem can reduce the concentrations of valproic acid, an epilepsy medication, by 70% and perhaps up to 95% within 24 hours; this can result in inadequate control of seizures. The effect is described for other carbapenem antibiotics as well, but seems to be most pronounced for ertapenem and meropenem. This is likely caused by several mechanisms: carbapenems inhibit transport of valproic acid from the gut into the body; they may increase metabolization of valproic acid to its glucuronide; they may reduce enterohepatic circulation and recycling of valproic acid glucuronide by acting against gut bacteria; and they may block transporter proteins that pump valproic acid out of red blood cells into the blood plasma. The effect is also seen in reverse: in cases where ertapenem has been withdrawn blood concentrations of valproate have been reported to rise.

Drug interactions via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system or the P-glycoprotein transporter are considered unlikely, as these proteins are not involved in the metabolism of ertapenem.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, ertapenem is bactericidal. It inhibits cross-linking of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls by blocking a type of enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). When a bacterial cell tries to synthesize new cell wall in order to grow and divide, the attempt fails, rendering the cell vulnerable to osmotic disruption. Additionally, the surplus of peptidoglycan precursors triggers autolytic enzymes of the bacterium, which disintegrate the existing wall.


===Susceptible bacteria===
Bacteria that are normally susceptible to ertapenem treatment (at least in Europe) include:
* Gram-positive aerobes
** Methicillin-susceptible &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species (including &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;)
** &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;
** &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; (not established for penicillin-resistant strains)
* Gram-negative aerobes
** &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
** &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;
** &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;
** &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;
** &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;
* Anaerobes:
** &quot;Clostridium&quot; species (excluding &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;)
** &quot;Eubacterium&quot; species
** &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; species
** &quot;Peptostreptococcus&quot; species
** &quot;Porphyromonas asaccharolytica&quot;
** &quot;Prevotella&quot; species

* The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label specifies activity against additional anaerobes:
** &quot;Bacteroides distasonis&quot;
** &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot;
** &quot;Bacteroides ovatus&quot;
** &quot;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&quot;
** &quot;Bacteroides uniformis&quot;

===Resistance===
Bacteria that show no clinically relevant response to ertapenem include methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species (including MRSA) as well as &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;, &quot;Aeromonas&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus&quot;, and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;.

Microorganisms can become resistant to ertapenem by producing carbapenemases, enzymes that inactivate the drug by opening the beta-lactam ring. Other mechanisms of resistance against carbapenems are development of efflux pumps that transport the antibiotics out of the bacterial cells, mutations of PBPs, and mutations of Gram-negative bacteria&#x27;s porins which are necessary for carbapenems to enter the bacteria.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The route of administration has only a slight effect on the drug&#x27;s concentrations in the bloodstream: when given as an intramuscular injection, its bioavailability is 90% (as compared to the 100% availability when given directly into a vein), and its highest concentrations in the blood plasma are reached after about 2.3 hours. In the blood, 85–95% of ertapenem are bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. Plasma protein binding is higher for lower concentrations, and vice versa. The drug is only partially metabolized, with 94% circulating in form of the parent substance and 6% as metabolites. The main metabolite is the inactive hydrolysis product with the ring opened.

Ertapenem is mainly eliminated via the kidneys and urine (80%) and to a minor extent via the faeces (10%). Of the 80% found in the urine, 38% is excreted as the parent drug and 37% as the ring-opened metabolite. The biological half-life is about 3.5 hours in women, 4.2 hours in men and 2.5 hours in children up to 12 years of age.

===Comparison with other antibiotics===
Like all carbapenem antibiotics, ertapenem has a broader spectrum of activity than other beta-lactams like penicillins and cephalosporins. Similar to doripenem, meropenem and biapenem, ertapenem has slightly better activity against many Gram-negative bacteria than other carbapenems such as imipenem. In contrast to imipenem, doripenem and meropenem, it is not active against &quot;Enterococcus&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species.

For diabetic foot infections, ertapenem as a single treatment or in combination with vancomycin has been found to be more effective and have fewer side effects than tigecycline, but in severe cases it is less effective than piperacillin/tazobactam.

Regarding pharmacokinetics, imipenem, doripenem and meropenem have lower plasma protein bindings (up to 25%) and shorter half-lives (about one hour) than ertapenem.

==History==
Ertapenem is marketed by Merck. It was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration in November 2001, and by the European Medicines Agency in April 2002.

<doc id="254728" wikidata="Q970141" url="?curid=254728" title="Combination (chess)">
<text>In chess, a combination is a sequence of moves, often initiated by a sacrifice, which leaves the opponent few options and results in tangible gain. At most points in a chess game, each player has several reasonable options from which to choose, which makes it difficult to plan ahead except in strategic terms. Combinations, in contrast to the norm, are sufficiently forcing that one can calculate exactly how advantage will be achieved against any defense. Indeed, it is usually necessary to see several moves ahead in exact detail before launching a combination, or else the initial sacrifice should not be undertaken.
==Definition==
In 1952/53, the editors of &quot;Shakhmaty v SSSR&quot; decided on this definition: &quot;A combination is a forced sequence of moves which uses tactical means and exploits specific peculiarities of the position to achieve a certain goal.&quot; 

Irving Chernev wrote:What is a combination? A combination is a blend of ideas – pins, forks, discovered checks, double attacks – which endow the pieces with magical power. It is a series of staggering blows before the knockout. It is the climactic scene in the play appearing on the board. It is the touch of enchantment that gives life to inanimate pieces. It is all this and more – A combination is the heart of chess .
==Example==
A combination is usually built out of two or more fundamental chess tactics such as forks, pins, skewers, undermining, discovered attacks, etc. Thus a combination is usually at least three moves long, but the longer it takes to recoup the initial sacrifice, the more impressive the combination. 
The position shown is from G. Stepanov–Peter Romanovsky, Leningrad 1926, and begins a combination which illustrates several forks and skewers. Black has just played 
:1... Rxf3+
Retreating with 2.Ke2 would allow 2...Nd4+, a attacking both White&#x27;s king and queen and winning the queen. Similarly, 2.Kd2 would allow 2...Rf2+ (skewering the white king and queen) 3.Be2 Rxe2+! 4.Kxe2 Nd4+, again winning the queen. White accordingly chose 
:2. Ke4
but after 
:2... d5+ 
White resigned. White cannot take the black rook since that loses his queen to the fork 3...Nd4+, but the alternative 3.cxd5 exd5+ 4.Kxd5 (again, taking the rook loses the queen to the fork 4...Nd4+) Be6+ would leave White with no good defense. Taking the bishop with 5.Kxe6 allows the long-threatened fork 5...Nd4+, while taking the knight with 5.Kxc6 allows the skewer 5...Rc8+ followed by 6...Rxc2. Retreating with 5.Ke4 permits the black bishop to skewer the white king and queen with 5...Bf5+, so White has only one option left: 5.Kd6.

After 5.Kd6, Black would have played 5...Rd8+. White still cannot take the knight for exactly the same reason as before, and 6.Kxe6 allows checkmate in one move with 6...Rf6#, which leaves one legal move, namely 6.Kc7, but then 6...Rf7+ absolutely forces the white king to take the black knight, allowing the skewer 7...Rc8+ followed by 8...Rxc2.

<doc id="254731" wikidata="Q51718" url="?curid=254731" title="Baldwin II of Jerusalem">
<text>Baldwin II, also known as Baldwin of Bourcq (; – 21August 1131), was Count of Edessa from 1100 to 1118, and King of Jerusalem from 1118 until his death. He accompanied Godfrey of Bouillon and Baldwin of Boulogne to the Holy Land during the First Crusade. He succeeded Baldwin of Boulogne as the second count of Edessa when he left the county for Jerusalem following his brother&#x27;s death. He was captured at the Battle of Harran in 1104. He was held first by Sökmen of Mardin, then by Jikirmish of Mosul, and finally by Jawali Saqawa. During his captivity, Tancred, the ruler of the Principality of Antioch, and Tancred&#x27;s cousin, Richard of Salerno, governed Edessa as Baldwin&#x27;s regents.

Baldwin was ransomed by his cousin, Joscelin of Courtenay, lord of Turbessel, in the summer of 1108. Tancred attempted to retain Edessa, but Bernard of Valence, the Latin patriarch of Antioch, persuaded him to restore the county to Baldwin. Baldwin allied with Jawali, but Tancred and his ally, Radwan of Aleppo, defeated them at Turbessel. Baldwin and Tancred were reconciled at an assembly of the crusader leaders near Tripoli in April 1109. Mawdud, the Atabeg of Mosul, and his successor, Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, launched a series of campaigns against Edessa in the early 1110s, devastating the eastern regions of the country. Baldwin accused Joscelin of treason for seizing the prosperous town of Turbessel from him in 1113 and captured the neighboring Armenian lordships in 1116 and 1117.

Baldwin I, the first king of Jerusalem, died on 2April 1118. He bequeathed Jerusalem to his brother Count Eustace III of Boulogne, stipulating that the throne was to be offered to Baldwin of Bourcq if Eustace failed to come to the Holy Land. Arnulf of Chocques, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, and Joscelin of Courtenay, who held the largest fief in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, convinced their peers to elect Baldwin king. Baldwin II (as he then became) took possession of most towns in the kingdom and gave Edessa to Joscelin. After the army of the Principality of Antioch was almost annihilated on 28 June 1119, Baldwin was elected regent for the absent Prince Bohemond II of Antioch. The frequent Seljuq invasions of Antioch forced him to spend most of his time in the principality, which caused discontent in Jerusalem. After Belek captured him in April 1123, a group of noblemen offered the throne to Count Charles I of Flanders, but Charles refused. During his absence, the Jerusalemite troops captured Tyre with the assistance of a Venetian fleet. After he was released in August 1124, he tried to capture Aleppo, but al-Bursuqi forced him to abandon the siege in early 1125.

Bohemond II came to Syria in October 1126. Baldwin gave his second daughter, Alice, in marriage to him and also renounced the regency. Baldwin planned to conquer Damascus, but he needed external support to achieve his goal. He married off his eldest daughter, Melisende, to the wealthy Count Fulk V of Anjou in 1129. The new troops who accompanied Fulk to Jerusalem enabled Baldwin to invade Damascene territory, but he could seize only Banias with the support of the Nizari (or Assassins) in late 1129. After Bohemond II was killed in a battle in early 1130, Baldwin forced Alice to leave Antioch and assumed the regency for her daughter, Constance. He fell seriously ill in Antioch and took monastic vows before he died in the Holy Sepulchre. Baldwin had been respected for his military talent, but he was notorious for his &quot;love for money&quot;.

==Early life==

Baldwin&#x27;s birth year is unknown. It is only known that his father, Count Hugh I of Rethel, was born in the 1040s and Baldwin was already an adult by the 1090s. Baldwin was the lord of Bourcq when he joined the army of his kinsman Godfrey of Bouillon at the beginning of the First Crusade. The army departed for the Holy Land on 15August 1096, and reached Constantinople on 23 December. The Byzantine emperor, Alexios I Komnenos, urged the crusader leaders to take an oath of fealty to him. Godfrey of Bouillon appointed Baldwin, Conon of Montaigu and Geoffrey of Esch to represent him at a meeting with Alexios in January 1097. After Godfrey and his principal commanders swore fealty to the Emperor, the crusader army was shipped to Asia Minor in February.

Baldwin&#x27;s cousin Baldwin of Boulogne and Tancred of Hauteville broke away from the main army to invade Cilicia around 15September 1097. Baldwin accompanied them in Boulogne&#x27;s contingent. He also participated in Boulogne&#x27;s military campaigns against the Seljuq rulers of the fortresses on the plains near the River Euphrates. After seizing Ravendel, Turbessel and Edessa, Boulogne established the first crusader state, the County of Edessa, in early 1098.

Baldwin rejoined the main crusader army, which was marching towards Jerusalem, near Tyre in late May 1099. He and Tancred seized Bethlehem; there was no resistance as the town was inhabited by local Christians. The crusaders laid siege to Jerusalem, and shortly afterwards Baldwin and Tancred captured an elderly Muslim nobleman. After he refused to convert to Christianity, Baldwin&#x27;s soldiers beheaded him at the Tower of David to frighten the defenders of Jerusalem. Jerusalem fell to the crusaders on 15July. Baldwin left Jerusalem in the retinue of Count Robert II of Flanders in late August. Robert returned to Europe, but Baldwin remained in Syria. Geoffrey of Bouillon died on 18July 1100. Baldwin of Boulogne decided to return to Jerusalem to take possession of Geoffrey&#x27;s inheritance.

==Count of Edessa==

===First years===

Baldwin was staying in Antioch when Baldwin of Boulogne decided to leave Edessa. He was a military commander of the troops of Bohemond I of Antioch who had recently been captured by Danishmend Gazi. Baldwin of Boulogne summoned Baldwin from Antioch and granted him the County of Edessa. Baldwin swore fealty to Baldwin of Boulogne, who left Edessa for Jerusalem on 2October 1100.

Baldwin married Morphia, the daughter of Gabriel, the Armenian lord of Melitene, which enabled him to consolidate his position among his mainly Armenian subjects. Sökmen, the Artuqid ruler of Mardin, attacked Saruj in early 1101. Baldwin attempted to relieve the town, but Sökmen routed his army, forcing him to return to Edessa. When relating these events, the Armenian historian, Matthew of Edessa, described Baldwin as a coward who was &quot;pitiful in body&quot;. Sökmen captured the town, but the fortress resisted his siege. Baldwin went to Antioch to raise new troops before returning to Saruj. He forced Sökmen to leave the town and executed all the townspeople who had cooperated with the Artuqids.

One of his cousins, Joscelin of Courtenay, came to Edessa in 1102. Baldwin granted him lands to the west of the Euphrates. When the Egyptians invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem in May, Baldwin of Boulognewho had been crowned king of Jerusalemsent envoys to Tancred (who ruled Antioch) and Baldwin, seeking their assistance. They assembled their troops and marched to Jerusalem together, but by the time they arrived in late September, the Egyptians had returned to their headquarters at Ascalon. The three crusader rulers made a raid against Ascalon, but Tancred and Baldwin soon returned to their realms.

Tancred&#x27;s ambitions in northern Syria irritated both Baldwin and Bernard of Valence, the Latin patriarch of Antioch. They started negotiations with Danishmend Gazi regarding Bohemond&#x27;s release. Kogh Vasil, the Armenian lord of Raban and Kaisun, and Bohemond&#x27;s Italian kinsmen contributed to his ransom. Bohemond was set free in May 1103. Baldwin granted villages to the Armenian prelate, Barsegh Pahlavuni, because he wanted to strengthen his position among his Armenian subjects.

===First captivity===

Baldwin&#x27;s troops made frequent raids against the fertile plains around Harran. Sökmen and Jikirmish, the atabeg of Mosul, made an alliance and invaded Edessa in May 1104. While their troops were assembling at Ras al-Ayn, Baldwin sent envoys to Joscelin and Bohemond and persuaded them to make a joint attack against Harran. Baldwin, Bohemond and Joscelin went together to Harran and entered into negotiations with the Seljuq garrison for a peaceful surrender. However, both Baldwin and Bohemond wanted to seize the wealthy town and the crusader army started disintegrating because of their conflict.

Sökmen and Jikirmish attacked the crusaders&#x27; camp at Harran on 7May. Applying the tactic of feigned retreat, they drew the crusaders into an ambush, capturing Baldwin and Joscelin. Bohemond and Tancred rode to Edessa to save the town. Benedict, Archbishop of Edessa, who was also captured but quickly released, and the Edessene knights elected Tancred regent for the captive Baldwin. Baldwin was first taken to Sökman&#x27;s tent, but Jikirmish&#x27;s soldiers broke into it and dragged him away. Joscelin remained in the custody of Sökmen, passing to Ilghazi upon the latter&#x27;s death. The citizens of Turbessel paid a ransom for Joscelin in 1107.

Jikirmish laid siege to Edessa, but Tancred routed his troops, forcing him to flee. Jikirmish then took Baldwin to Mosul. Tancred captured a Seljuq princess of Jikirmish&#x27;s household at Edessa. Jikirmish offered to pay 15,000 bezants in ransom, or to release Baldwin in return for her liberty. Bohemond and Tancred preferred the money and Baldwin remained imprisoned. Before his departure for Europe in the autumn, Bohemond appointed Tancred to rule Antioch and their kinsman, Richard of Salerno, was entrusted with the administration of Edessa.

A Turkish soldier of fortune, Jawali Saqawa, captured Jikirmish and seized Mosul in 1107. Joscelin started negotiations with Jawali over the release of Baldwin. Jawali demanded 60,000 dinars and the release of the Muslim prisoners from Edessa. The Seljuq Sultan, Muhammad I Tapar, made the Mamluk Mawdud atabeg of Mosul. When Mawdud expelled Jawali from Mosul, Jawali fled to the fortress of Qalat Jabar, taking Baldwin with him. Joscelin paid 30,000 dinars to Jawali and offered himself as hostage to guarantee the payment of the balance. Jawali, who needed allies against Mawdud, accepted the offer and released Baldwin in the summer of 1108.

===Conflicts===

Baldwin went to Edessa after his release, but Tancred demanded his oath of fealty in exchange for the town. Baldwin refused and went to Turbessel. After Tancred carried out a raid against Turbessel, they started peace negotiations, but could not reach a compromise. Baldwin made an alliance with Kogh Vasil against Tancred. Oshin of Lampron also sent troops300 Pecheneg horsemento join them. Their raids against the Principality of Antioch persuaded Tancred to accept the arbitration of the Catholic prelates, who decided in favor of Baldwin; he returned to Edessa on 18September 1108.

In accordance with his treaty with Jawali, Baldwin released most of the Muslim prisoners held in Edessa. He also allowed the Muslim burghers of Saruj to build a mosque, and executed the unpopular &quot;rais&quot; (or governor) of the town, who was a convert from Islam. Jawali&#x27;s alliance with Baldwin alarmed Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan, the Seljuq ruler of Aleppo, which brought about a rapprochement between Radwan and Tancred. When Jawali launched a military expedition against Aleppo, Baldwin and Joscelin of Courtney joined him, while Tancred came to assist Radwan. Radwan and Tancred routed Jawali, Baldwin and Joscelin near Turbessel in late September 1108.

Baldwin fled the battlefield to a nearby fortress. Tancred laid siege to it, but lifted the siege when he learnt of Jawali&#x27;s approach. Believing that Baldwin had died, the Armenian burghers of Edessa held an assembly to set up a provisional government. After his return, Baldwin thought that the Armenians wanted to dethrone him and ordered the blinding of the ringleaders. The Armenian bishop of the town was obliged to pay a huge fine. To put an end to the conflicts between the crusader leaders, Baldwin I of Jerusalem summoned them in the name of the &quot;Church of Jerusalem&quot; to Mount Pilgrim near Tripoli in April 1109. At the meeting, the king mediated a reconciliation between Baldwin and Tancred, who acknowledged Baldwin&#x27;s rule in the County of Edessa in exchange for receiving Galilee and other fiefs in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Thereafter Baldwin participated in the siege of Tripoli, which ended with the capture of the town by the crusaders.

===Mawdud&#x27;s campaigns===

The Seljuq sultan instructed Mawdud to unite his troops with the Seljuq ruler of Armenia, Sökmen el-Kutbî, and the Artuqid Ilghazi against the crusaders. They laid siege to Edessa in April 1110. Baldwin sent envoys to Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who was besieging Beirut, urging him to come to his rescue, but the king did not abandon the siege until Beirut fell on 13May. Before departing for Edessa, Baldwin I celebrated Pentecost in Jerusalem. The King persuaded Bertrand of Tripoli, Joscelin of Courtenay and other crusader leaders to join his campaign, and the Armenian Kogh Vasil and Ablgharib also sent contingents. On their arrival, Mawdud and his allies lifted the siege of Edessa and withdrew towards Harran.

Baldwin and Tancred accused each other of having incited the invasion. Tancred also claimed sovereignty over the County of Edessa, saying that its territory had been subject to Antioch under the Byzantine Empire. Baldwin I refuted Tancred&#x27;s claim, declaring himself the head of the Latin East. After a short campaign against the neighboring Muslim territories, the rulers of the other crusader states decided to leave the county. On the King&#x27;s advice, Baldwin ordered the transfer of the local Christian (predominantly Armenian) peasants to the lands to the west of the Euphrates. Taking advantage of the gathering of the Christian peasants by the river and their mainly Armenian escort, Mawdud attacked and massacred them. Baldwin, who had already crossed the river along with the other crusader leaders, hastily returned and assaulted Mawdud&#x27;s troops, although they outnumbered his small retinue. Baldwin and his men were only saved by Baldwin I and Tancred, who had followed on the other bank of the river.

In July 1111 Mawdud launched a new invasion against the county and laid siege to Turbessel. While Mawdud was besieging Turbessel, Sultan, the Munquidite emir (or ruler) of Shaizar, sent envoys to him, seeking his assistance against Tancred. Mawdud lifted the siege of Turbessel and moved to help Shaizar. Toghtekin, the atabeg of Damascus, joined him and they decided to reconquer Tripoli in September. The concentration of Muslim forces alarmed the crusaders and Baldwin I of Jerusalem summoned all crusader rulers to his camp. Baldwin complied, accompanied by his two powerful vassals, Joscelin and Pagan of Sajar. The smaller Muslim rulers had meanwhile left Mawdud&#x27;s camp and returned to Mesopotamia. Mawdud did not risk a pitched battle with the united crusader armies and retired first to Shaizar, and later to Mosul. In April 1112, Mawdud returned and besieged Edessa. His agents started secret negotiations with some Armenian soldiers in the town, but Joscelin, who was informed of the plot, warned Baldwin. Mawdud could not capture the town and withdrew to Mosul in June. Next year, he was murdered by Assassins at Damascus.

Mawdud&#x27;s invasions devastated the eastern regions of the county, but Joscelin&#x27;s fief at Turbessel still flourished. In 1113 Baldwin persuaded Joscelin to come to Edessa, saying that he was dying and wanted to make his last will. Stating that Joscelin had not sent enough food to Edessa, Baldwin had him imprisoned and only released him after Joscelin renounced Turbessel. Joscelin soon left the county for Jerusalem, where Baldwin I granted Galilee to him. A new reconciliation between the crusader leaders was brought about by marriage alliances: Baldwin&#x27;s sister, Cecilia, was given in marriage to Roger of Salerno, who had succeeded Tancred in Antioch in late 1112; and Joscelin married Roger&#x27;s sister, Maria.

===Expansion===

While Baldwin was away from his capital to take possession of Turbessel, the Armenians of Edessa continued to plot against him. He returned to the town and ordered the transportation of the Armenian townspeople to Samosata. After the Armenians started to move to Kaisun, Baldwin allowed those who remained in Samosata to return to Edessa in early 1114.

Mawdud&#x27;s successor, Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, invaded the county in May 1114, but Edessa resisted his siege, forcing him to return to Mosul. The Sultan made Bursuq ibn Bursuq of Hamadan the supreme commander of the Seljuq armies. Bursuq moved on Edessa in early 1115, but he soon left for Aleppo. Lulu el-Yaya, the atabeg of Aleppo, sought assistance from Ilghazi and Toghtekin, who also persuaded Roger of Salerno to join their coalition against Bursuq. At Roger&#x27;s request, Baldwin I of Jerusalem, Pons of Tripoli and Baldwin also gathered their troops at Apamea in August. Bursuq chose to retreat and the crusader rulers dispersed.

Taking advantage of the weakening of the Seljuqs&#x27; power after Roger of Salerno&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Sarmin, Baldwin decided to annex the small Armenian principalities in the valley of the Euphrates. The Armenian Thoros I of Cilicia captured Kogh Vasil&#x27;s successor, Vasil Dgha, who had made an alliance with Bursuq. Thoros sold Vasil Dgha to Baldwin, who forced his prisoner to renounce Raban and Kaisun in 1116. Next, Baldwin laid siege to Abu&#x27;l-Garib&#x27;s fortress of Birejik. The siege lasted for a year and Ablgharib was forced into surrender in 1117. Baldwin granted the fortress to his cousin, Waleran of Le Puiset. In the same year, Kogh Vasil&#x27;s brother, Bagrat, had to abandon Cyrrhus and Baldwin captured Constantine of Gargar.

==King of Jerusalem==

===Accession to the throne===

The childless Baldwin I of Jerusalem died on 2April 1118, during a campaign against Egypt. According to the contemporaneous Albert of Aachen he had willed the kingdom to his eldest brother, Eustace III of Boulogne, &quot;if by chance he would come&quot;, but also stipulated that Baldwin of Bourcq should be elected king if Eustace were unable to come &quot;because of his age&quot;. Baldwin arrived in Jerusalem around the day when the late king&#x27;s body was carried into the town. Albert of Aachen stated that Baldwin had come to celebrate Easter in Jerusalem without having any knowledge of the King&#x27;s death. Decades later, William of Tyre recorded that Baldwin had been informed of his kinsman&#x27;s death during his journey to Jerusalem.
The question of Baldwin I&#x27;s succession divided the barons and the prelates, according to William of Tyre. The highest-ranking prelate, Arnulf of Chocques, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, and Joscelin of Courtenay, who held the largest fief in the kingdom, argued that Baldwin should be elected without delay to avoid an interregnum. Others maintained that the crown should first be offered to Eustace in accordance with Baldwin I&#x27;s last will. Some &quot;great nobles&quot;, whom William of Tyre did not name, were appointed to inform Eustace of his brother&#x27;s death. However, shortly after their departure, on Easter Day (14 April), Baldwin was anointed. His coronation was delayed for unknown reasons. Historian Malcolm Barber believes that Baldwin wished to be crowned along with his wife, who was not in the kingdom at the time.

Baldwin promised the County of Edessa to Joscelin, but Joscelin remained in the kingdom to secure the defence of Galilee. Baldwin convoked the noblemen to an assembly &quot;on an appointed day&quot; to receive &quot;fealty and an oath of allegiance from them&quot;, according to Albert of Aachen. He also secured the direct royal control of eight important towns, including Nablus, Jaffa, Acre, Sidon and Tiberias. The modern historian Alan Murray argues that Albert of Aachen&#x27;s words are evidence that Baldwin &quot;carried out a major distribution of fiefs, granting out some lordships but retaining other towns and territories as domain lands&quot; in 1118. Baldwin also reorganized the royal household, making Hugh Caulis constable, Pagan butler, and John the chamberlain.

Eustace accepted the barons&#x27; invitation and left Boulogne for Jerusalem. He had travelled as far as Apulia when he was informed of Baldwin&#x27;s accession to the throne. The delegates tried to convince him to continue his journey, saying that Baldwin&#x27;s election was illegal, but Eustace preferred to return home.

===Muslim threat===

His predecessor&#x27;s last campaign against Egypt brought about a rapprochement between Egypt and Damascus. Baldwin sent envoys to Toghtekin in Damascus to argue against his making an alliance with the Egyptian vizier, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, but Toghtekin demanded Oultrejourdain in return for his neutrality. Toghtekin launched an incursion against Galilee and Al-Afdal gathered his troops near Ascalon in May or June 1118. Baldwin hurried to the southern frontier and urged Roger and Pons to send reinforcements from Antioch and Tripoli. Neither the Egyptians nor the crusaders risked a pitched battle and both armies were dissolved three months later. Baldwin and Joscelin made a raid against Damascene territory in the autumn and defeated Toghtekin&#x27;s son, Taj al-Muluk Buri near Daraa.

Ilghazi, Toghtekin and the Munquidites of Shaizar made an alliance and their troops started raiding Antioch and Edessa in May 1119. Roger sent envoys to Baldwin, urging him to come to the north to fight against the invaders. The envoys met with Baldwin in Tiberias, because he had just concluded a short campaign against a Bedouin tribe in Oultrejourdain. He gathered troops and departed for Antioch, taking a portion of the True Cross with him. Roger did not wait until Baldwin&#x27;s arrival and marched from Antioch. On the plains of Sarmada Ilghazi&#x27;s army encircled the crusaders&#x27; camp and on 28June inflicted a major defeat in the Battle of the &quot;Field of Blood&quot;. Roger and hundreds of his soldiers died fighting and most who survived the battle were taken prisoner. Antioch was left almost undefended, but Ilghazi did not attack the city.

Baldwin and Pons of Tripoli reached Antioch in late July or early August. The leaders of the city acknowledged Baldwin as regent for the lawful prince, the ten-year old Bohemond II, who was living in southern Italy. Baldwin distributed the estates of the noblemen who had perished in the Field of Blood among his retainers, mainly through giving the widows of the deceased lords to them in marriage. Meanwhile, Ilghazi and Toghtekin joined their forces and started to capture the Antiochene fortresses to the east of the Orontes River. Baldwin gathered almost all available crusader troops and marched against the Muslims as far as Tell Danith near Zardana. The crusaders and the united armies of Toghtekin and Ilghazi clashed in the Battle of Hab on 14August. According to Walter the Chancellor, the crusaders routed the Muslims, but Matthew of Edessa stated that &quot;neither side was defeated nor was victorious&quot;. Baldwin returned to Antioch two days later, where the townspeople and the patriarch gave him a &quot;victor&#x27;s welcome&quot;. Before leaving Antioch, he granted the County of Edessa to Joscelin of Courtenay.
Baldwin and his wife were crowned king and queen in Bethlehem on Christmas Day. He and the Patriarch held a general assembly at the Council of Nablus on 16January 1120. The prelates and noblemen who attended the meeting confirmed the clergy&#x27;s right to collect the tithe and to bear arms &quot;in the cause of defense&quot;. The council also ordered the punishment of adulterers, pimps, sodomites and bigamists, and prohibited sexual relations between Christians and Muslims. Other decrees established penalties against thieves and those who falsely accused others of crimes. The decisions of the council were the first examples of law making in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

A confraternity of knights established by Hugh of Payns and Godfrey de Saint-Omer to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land most probably received official recognition at the council, according to historians Malcolm Barber and Christopher Tyerman. Baldwin temporarily lodged the knights in the royal palace on the Temple Mount and they became known as the Knights Templar. He offered Nabi Samwil to the Cistercians, but Bernard of Clairvaux ceded the place to the Premonstratensians who built a monastery. Shortly after the council, Baldwin and Patriarch Warmund also sent letters to Pope Calixtus II and the Venetians, urging them to support the defense of the Holy Land. The crusaders especially needed the Venetians&#x27; ships against the Egyptians.

Ilghazi and his nephew, Belek Ghazi, invaded Edessa and Antioch in May 1120. Being responsible for the defense of the northern crusader states, Baldwin decided to again lead his troops to Antioch, but a significant group of the Jerusalemite noblemen and clergy opposed the expedition. Patriarch Warmund refused to accompany the royal army and allowed Baldwin to take the True Cross with him only after lengthy negotiations. Baldwin and his army reached Antioch in June. Ilghazi agreed to sign a one-year truce, which secured the possession of Kafartab and two other fortresses for the crusaders.

Baldwin returned to Jerusalem only in early 1121, after Toghtekin made a raid against Galilee. In July, he invaded Damascene territory and destroyed a fortress that Toghtekin had recently erected near Jerash. David IV of Georgia routed the united armies of Ilghazi and the Seljuq prince Toghrul Arslan in August. Taking advantage of Ilghazi&#x27;s weakness, Baldwin launched a military campaign across the Orontes. In November this forced Ilghazi&#x27;s son to hand over to the crusaders Zardana, Atarib and other forts that Ilghazi had captured the previous year.

In early 1122 Pons of Tripoli refused to pledge allegiance to Baldwin for unknown reasons. After Baldwin mustered his troops and marched against Tripoli, Pons paid homage to him without resistance. Ilghazi and Belek laid siege to Zardana in June, but Baldwin and Joscelin of Edessa&#x27;s arrival forced them to lift the siege in July. Belek ambushed and captured Joscelin near Saruj on 13September. Ilghazi reoccupied Atarib, but he died on 3November 1122. His lands were divided among his sons and nephews. Baldwin, who was still in Antioch, persuaded Badr ad-Daulah Suleiman, the new ruler of Aleppo, to restore Atarib to the crusaders on 2April 1123. Baldwin recaptured Birejik and made Geoffrey, Lord of Marash, regent of Edessa.

===Second captivity===
Baldwin made a raid towards Kharput where Belek held Joscelin and other knights&#x27; captive, but he stopped near Gargar. While Baldwin was preparing to practice falconry on the morning of 18April 1123, Belek attacked his camp and captured him. Baldwin was taken to the fortress of Kharput. While Belek was away in Aleppo in June, Joscelin&#x27;s fifty Armenian supporters came to Kharput, disguising themselves as monks, and expelled the Seljuq garrison from the fortress. Joscelin left Kharput to gather troops in Turbessel and Antioch, but Baldwin and the Armenian soldiers remained in the fortress to defend it against Belek. Belek returned to Kharput and forced Baldwin to surrender. Belek ordered the execution of the Armenians and transferred Baldwin to Harran. Baldwin was later imprisoned in the Citadel of Aleppo.

On learning of Baldwin&#x27;s captivity, Patriarch Warmund convoked the prelates and barons to an assembly which elected Eustace Grenier bailiff (or regent) of Jerusalem. After Grenier died on 15June, William of Bures succeeded him as regent. The bailiffs and the patriarch closely cooperated with each other and other high-ranking officials in administering the kingdom during Baldwin&#x27;s captivity. They made an alliancethe so-called &quot;Pactum Warmundi&quot;with Domenico Michiel, the Doge of Venice, offering commercial privileges to the Venetians in return for their military assistance against the Egyptian towns on the coast. They captured Tyre on 7or 8July 1124.

The contemporaneous Galbert of Bruges recorded that delegates came to Flanders from Jerusalem during Baldwin&#x27;s captivity. They stated that Baldwin &quot;was grasping and penurious and had not governed the people of God well&quot;. They offered the crown to Charles the Good, the Count of Flanders. Bruges&#x27;s report shows that a faction of the Jerusalemite nobility attempted to dethrone the captive Baldwin. Being the head of the lineage from which the first two rulers of Jerusalem were descended, and also the overlord of their brother, Eustace, Charles the Good was an ideal candidate for the throne. However, he refused the offer. Murray tentatively associates the leader of the discontented noblemen with the Flemish Eustace Grenier.

Belek died fighting against one of his rebellious officials on 6May 1124, and Baldwin was seized by Ilghazi&#x27;s son, Timurtash. Timurtash entrusted Sultan, the emir of Shaizar, with commencing negotiations for Baldwin&#x27;s release with Joscelin and Morphia. According to their agreement, Baldwin was to pay 80,000 dinars and to cede Atarib, Zardana, Azaz and other Antiochene fortresses to Timurtash. Baldwin also promised that he would assist Timurtash against the Bedouin warlord, Dubais ibn Sadaqa. After a quarter of Baldwin&#x27;s ransom was paid and a dozen hostages (including Baldwin&#x27;s youngest daughter Ioveta and Joscelin&#x27;s son Joscelin II) were handed over to Timurtash to secure the payment of the balance, Baldwin was released on 29August 1124.

===Wars===

Baldwin went to Antioch where Patriarch Bernard reminded him that he had not been authorized to renounce Antiochene territories and on 6September 1124 forbade him to cede fortresses to Timurtash. On 6October, Baldwin laid siege to Aleppo where the hostages for his ransom were held. Dubais ibn Sadaqa, and two Seljuq princes, Sultan Shah and Toghrul Arslan, joined him and Timurtash did not support the besieged town. Al-Bursuqi decided to intervene and gathered his troops. On learning of al-Bursuqi&#x27;s approach, Dubais ibn Sadaqa withdrew from Aleppo, which forced Baldwin to lift the siege on 25January 1125.

After more than two years absence, Baldwin returned to Jerusalem on 3April. He renegotiated the &quot;Pactum Warmundi&quot; with the Venetians, approving most of its terms in the so-called &quot;Pactum Balduini&quot;, but also stipulating that the Venetians were to provide military assistance to the kingdom. After al-Bursuqi, Toghtekin and Khirkan of Homs captured Kafartab and laid siege to Zardana, Baldwin again went north. Few knights accompanied him from the kingdom, which according to Murray and Barber may have been a sign of discontent over his frequent campaigns. Pons of Tripoli and Joscelin of Edessa joined him and they defeated the Seljuqs at the Battle of Azaz in late May. The battle has been described by historian Peter Lock as &quot;one of the bloodiest engagements in the history of the crusader states&quot;. Spoils seized enabled Baldwin to pay off his ransom before his return to Jerusalem.

The careers of some influential lords started around the time when Baldwin returned to Jerusalem in 1125. Walter I Brisebarre witnessed the &quot;Pactum Balduini&quot; as lord of Beirut on 2May 1125; Pagan the Butler was first mentioned as lord of Oultrejordain in 1126. According to William of Tyre, Pagan seized Oultrejordain after Roman of Le Puy and his son, Ralph, had been deprived of the territory. Murray argues that Baldwin must have confiscated Oultrejordain from Roman because Roman had been one of his opponents during his captivity. Murray also says that Baldwin allegedly adopted an expansionist policy against Damascus in the late 1120s to assuage the Jerusalemite noblemen&#x27;s discontent. He made a raid against Damascene territory across the Jordan in early 1126. Accompanied by almost the whole army, Baldwin routed Toghtekin on 25January and returned to the kingdom laden with booty. Shortly thereafter he supported Pons of Tripoli in capturing Rafniye and in raiding Homs. Al-Bursuqi laid siege to Atarib in July 1126. Baldwin again marched north and Joscelin of Edessa joined him at Artah. Both sides wanted to avoid a pitched battle, and al-Bursuqi retired to Aleppo.

===Succession===

After reaching the age of majority, Bohemond II of Antioch came to Syria to claim his inheritance in October 1126. His arrival put an end to Baldwin&#x27;s rule in Antioch, but Bohemond married Baldwin&#x27;s second daughter, Alice. Baldwin, who had no sons, made his eldest daughter, Melisende, his heir in 1126 or 1127.

Baldwin had already realized that the Franks were unable to conquer Damascus without further reinforcements from Europe. After consulting with his nobles, he sent William I of Bures and Guy I Brisebarre to France to offer Melisende&#x27;s hand to the powerful count of Anjou, Fulk V, in the autumn of 1127. Hugh of Payns and his five fellows accompanied the envoys. The embassy first visited Louis VI of France, who gave consent to the marriage. The negotiations between Fulk and Baldwin&#x27;s envoys lasted for months. In August or September 1127, Baldwin launched a new military campaign against Damascene territory. Historian Steven Tibble proposes that the royal fortress at Wadi Musa was built shortly after this.

Baldwin dispatched William I, Archbishop of Tyre, and Robert, Bishop of Lydda and Ramla, to the Holy See. Pope Honorius II stated that Baldwin was the lawful ruler of Jerusalem in a letter of 29May 1129. Christopher Tyerman and Hans Eberhard Mayer agree that the pope wrote his letter to remove any doubts about the legitimacy of Baldwin&#x27;s rule. On the other hand, Stephen of La Ferté, who had succeeded Warmund of Picquigny as patriarch in July 1128, turned against Baldwin and demanded Jerusalem for the patriarchate.

Fulk of Anjou arrived to the Holy Land in the spring of 1129. He married Melisende and Baldwin granted them the two wealthiest towns of the kingdom, Tyre and Acre. Hugh of Payns, who had achieved the adoption of the statutes of the Knights Templar at the Council of Troyes, returned to the kingdom accompanied by new crusaders.

Toghtekin&#x27;s successor, Taj al-Muluk Buri, ordered the massacre of the Nizari in Damascus in September 1129. The Nizari&#x27;s local leader, Ismail al-Ajami, sent envoys to Baldwin and offered the fortress of Banias to the crusaders in return for receiving asylum in the kingdom. Baldwin accepted the offer and his troops seized Banyas. Taking advantage of the presence of the new crusaders, he also decided to launch an attack on Damascus. He gathered all available troops and marched as far as the Wooden Bridge, about south-west of the town, in November. After Buri&#x27;s Turcoman horsemen routed a detachment of the crusader army and a heavy storm turned the plains around Damascus into a large marshland, Baldwin had to return to Jerusalem in early December.

After the Danishmend Gazi Gümüshtigin ambushed and killed Bohemond II in February 1130, Baldwin travelled to Antioch to make arrangements for the administration of the principality. Alice, however, wanted to establish herself as regent during the minority of her and Bohemond&#x27;s infant daughter, Constance, and did not allow Baldwin to enter Antioch. She even sent envoys to Imad ad-Din Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul, to seek his assistance against her father, according to the contemporaneous Ibn al-Qalanisi. The Antiochene noblemen were strongly opposed to her plan and opened two gates of the town, which enabled Baldwin to enter. He forgave his daughter but forbade her to stay in Antioch during Constance&#x27;s minority. After the Antiochene noblemen swore fealty to him and Constance, Baldwin appointed Joscelin of Edessa to administer the principality.

According to William of Tyre, Baldwin fell seriously ill after his return from Antioch. He was already dying when he made arrangements for his succession in August 1131. He was transferred to the patriarch&#x27;s palace near the Holy Sepulchre where he bequeathed the kingdom to Fulk, Melisende and their infant son, Baldwin. He took monastic vows and entered the collegiate chapter of the Holy Sepulchre, where he died on 21 August. He was buried in the Holy Sepulchre.

==Ancestry==
Baldwin was a younger son of Hugh I, Count of Rethel and Melisende of Montlhéry. He was closely related to the lords of Courtenay and Le Puiset, and other noble families in the Ile-de-France. He was also a kinsman of the brothers Eustace III of Boulogne, Godfrey of Bouillon, and Baldwin of Boulogne, but their exact relationship is unknown.

The main concern are the identities of Baldwin II&#x27;s paternal grandmother and great-grandmother. The Chronicles of Alberic of Trois-Fontaine (written in 1119) describes Yvette, sister of Ebles I of Roucy as &quot;mother of Hugh I, Count of Rethel&quot;. This is the traditional genealogy given for Baldwin II. Notwithstanding, considering her family history, such assertion is chronologically impossible. Jean-Nöel Mathieu raises the fundamental objection that Ebles I (who died in 1033), could not have had a sister who was still alive in 1081, instead he argues that she must have been confused with the wife of Manasses II.

&quot;Li Estoire de Jerusalem et d&#x27;Antioche&quot;, written in the 12th century, indicates that Manasses III was married to a daughter of Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine. This would also explain the connection between the two Baldwins of Jerusalem, as well as the fact that Godfrey made a donation to Manasses in 1065.

Alan V. Murray says that the primary sources suggest that Baldwin II&#x27;s connection to his predecessors &quot;was not particularly close&quot;, and that Baldwin was most probably related to their mother, Ida of Lorraine. Thomas Asbridge says that Baldwin was their second cousin instead.

The family tree below is the reconstruction based on the above two records, which makes Baldwin II a first cousin once removed of his predecessors through their mother. Asbridge&#x27;s view would match the alternate hypothesis that has Godfrey III&#x27;s wife Doda as Manasses III&#x27;s sister instead of his mother-in-law. There is also a hypothesis that Judith was Eustace II&#x27;s sister. However, Murray objects that there is no allusion of this daughter nor of any other connection between the Rethel and Boulogne families in Genealogica comitum Boloniensium&#x27;, a compilation of the Boulogne genealogy which was being copied and extended by the mid-twelfth century, when the descendants of Manasses III were ruling the kingdom of Jerusalem. The three women in question are in italics.




==Family==

Most Armenians adhered to the Armenian Apostolic Church, but Baldwin&#x27;s wife, Morphia, was born to an Orthodox noble family. Her father, Gabriel, gave her in marriage to Baldwin, because he needed the crusaders&#x27; support against his enemies. Morphia gave birth to four daughters. She died on 1October 1126 or 1127.

The eldest daughter of Baldwin and Morphia, Melisende, succeeded Baldwin along with her husband, Fulk. They were crowned in the Holy Sepulchre on 14September 1131. Baldwin&#x27;s second daughter, Alice, made several attempts to administer Antioch after Baldwin&#x27;s death. Hodierna was Baldwin and Morphia&#x27;s third daughter. She was given in marriage to Raymond II, Count of Tripoli before 1138. Ioveta was her parents&#x27; youngest daughter, and their only child &quot;born into the purple&quot; (that is after her father&#x27;s coronation). She entered the Convent of Saint Anne in Jerusalem around 1134. About 10 years later, she became the second abbess of the convent that Melisende had established at the Tomb of Lazarus in Bethany.

==Legacy==

Baldwin&#x27;s contemporaries often criticized him. Matthew of Edessa, who recorded the Armenians&#x27; grievances during Baldwin&#x27;s reign in Edessa, described him as a greedy ruler who had &quot;an intolerable love for money&quot;. Bernard of Blois, an ascetic monk who settled in the Amanus Mountains, blamed him for &quot;certain enormities in his way of life&quot;. Fulcher of Chartres hinted that Baldwin&#x27;s captivity was a punishment for sin, because he had never seen other kings who were imprisoned.

William of Tyre described Baldwin as &quot;a devout and God-fearing man, notable for his loyalty and for his great experience in military matters,&quot; and said that he was nicknamed &quot;the Thorny&quot; (&quot;cognominatus est Aculeus&quot;). Ibn al-Qalanisi, who calls him &quot;Baldwin the Little&quot; (&quot;Baghdawin al-ru&#x27;aiuis&quot;) to distinguish him from Baldwin I, remarked that &quot;after him there was none left amongst them possessed of sound judgment and capacity to govern&quot;.

In 1996, True landed her breakthrough role as Rochelle Zimmerman in the supernatural horror film, &quot;The Craft&quot;, where she played a member of a teenage coven. True stated that she had to &quot;fight&quot; to audition for the part and was actively going up against her future co-stars Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Robin Tunney. Her role was originally written for a white actress, but that didn&#x27;t deter her from auditioning. In 1997, she starred in the comedy-drama film, &quot;Nowhere&quot; alongside James Duval, the film received mixed reviews from critics. The following year, True starred as Dave Chappelle&#x27;s romantic interest in the comedy film, &quot;Half Baked&quot;.

She starred alongside Monica and Essence Atkins in the 2000 romantic drama film &quot;Love Song&quot;. From 2002 to 2006, True starred with Essence Atkins in the UPN comedy series, &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;, as paternal half-sisters who barely knew each other until becoming adults. She returned to film, playing the supporting role in the 2007 comedy &quot;The Perfect Holiday&quot;. The following years, she appeared in a number of smaller and made-for-television films, include The Asylum productions &quot;Social Nightmare&quot; (2013), &quot;Blood Lake: Attack of the Killer Lampreys&quot; (2014), &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot; (2014), and &quot;Sharknado: Heart of Sharkness&quot; (2015).

<doc id="254736" wikidata="Q3824940" url="?curid=254736" title="Pricing objectives">
<text>Pricing objectives or goals give direction to the whole pricing process. Determining what your objectives are is the first step in pricing. When deciding on pricing objectives you must consider: 1) the overall financial, marketing, and strategic objectives of the company; 2) the objectives of your product or brand; 3) consumer price elasticity and price points; and 4) the resources you have available.

Some of the more common pricing objectives are:
* maximize long-run profit
* maximize short-run profit
* increase sales volume (quantity)
* increase monetary sales 
* increase market share
* obtain a target rate of return on investment (ROI)
* obtain a target rate of return on sales
* stabilize market or stabilize market price: an objective to stabilize price means that the marketing manager attempts to keep prices stable in the marketplace and to compete on non-price considerations. Stabilization of margin is basically a cost-plus approach in which the manager attempts to maintain the same margin regardless of changes in cost. 
* company growth
* maintain price leadership
* desensitize customers to price
* discourage new entrants into the industry
* match competitors prices
* encourage the exit of marginal firms from the industry
* survival
* avoid government investigation or intervention
* obtain or maintain the loyalty and enthusiasm of distributors and other sales personnel
* enhance the image of the firm, brand, or product
* be perceived as “fair” by customers and potential customers
* create interest and excitement about a product
* discourage competitors from cutting prices
* use price to make the product “visible&quot;
* help prepare for the sale of the business (harvesting)
* social, ethical, or ideological objectives

<text>Human Being is the third studio album by British singer Seal, released in 1998. The title track was written about late rappers Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. &quot;Human Being&quot; received mixed reviews ranging from being panned for its overtly dark and moody feel, to being described in terms such as &quot;pop perfection&quot;. The album featured Seal naked on the cover. The album failed to sell in the same way as his 1994 multi-platinum album, &quot;Seal&quot;, however, it is a fan favourite.

A remix of &quot;Lost My Faith&quot; was featured over the closing credits of the 1999 film &quot;Entrapment&quot;, and the song&#x27;s single release was accompanied by a music video in which Seal is integrated into scenes from the film alongside Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

The cover art for the album was shot by French fashion photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino.

<doc id="254753" wikidata="Q1062332" url="?curid=254753" title="Frequent-flyer program">
<text>A frequent-flyer programme (FFP) is a loyalty program offered by an airline.

Many airlines have frequent-flyer programmes designed to encourage airline customers enrolled in the programme to accumulate points (also called miles, kilometres, or segments) which may then be redeemed for air travel or other rewards. Points earned under FFPs may be based on the class of fare, distance flown on that airline or its partners, or the amount paid. There are other ways to earn points. For example, in recent years, more points have been earned by using co-branded credit and debit cards than by air travel. Another way to earn points is spending money at associated retail outlets, car hire companies, hotels, or other associated businesses. Points can be redeemed for air travel, other goods or services, or for increased benefits, such as travel class upgrades, airport lounge access, fast-track access, or priority bookings.

Frequent-flyer programs can be seen as a certain type of virtual currency, one with unidirectional flow of money to purchase points, but no exchange back into money.

FFPs have become an important part of airlines&#x27; economic models, with for example United
and Delta both able to earn more than $1 billion in 2015 because of their FFP.

== History ==
Although United Airlines had tracked customers as far back as the 1950s, the first modern frequent-flyer programme was created in 1972 by Western Direct Marketing for United. It gave plaques and promotional materials to members. In 1979, Texas International Airlines created the first frequent-flyer programme that used mileage tracking to give &#x27;rewards&#x27; to its passengers, while in 1980 Western Airlines created its Travel Bank, which ultimately became part of Delta Air Lines&#x27; programme upon their merger in 1987. American Airlines&#x27; AAdvantage programme launched in 1981 as a modification of a never-realized concept from 1979 that would have given special fares to frequent customers. It was quickly followed later that year by programs from United Airlines (Mileage Plus), Delta (Delta Air Lines Frequent Flyer Program, which later changed to SkyMiles), Continental Airlines (OnePass), Air Canada (Aeroplan), and in 1982 from British Airways (Executive Club).

Frequent-flyer programs have grown since. In 2005, 163 million people were enrolled in frequent flyer programs from over 130 airlines. By then, 14 trillion frequent-flyer points had been accumulated by people worldwide, for a value of 700 billion US dollars. When United Airlines filed for bankruptcy in 2002, its frequent flyer programme was its only money-making business. Tom Stuker is the world&#x27;s most frequent flier having logged over 21 million miles with United.

== Accrual ==
=== Flying ===
Most larger airlines around the world have frequent flyer programs; each has a programme name, and policies and restrictions regarding joining, accumulating, and redeeming points.

The primary method of obtaining points in a frequent-flyer programme until recent years was to fly with the associated airline. Paying expenses using an airline-sponsored credit card, even those charged to an employer, can rack up frequent flyer points. Most systems reward travellers with a specific number of points based on the distance travelled (such as 1 point per mile flown), although systems vary. Many discount airlines, rather than awarding points per mile, award points for flight segments in lieu of distance or the amount paid. For example, a number of airlines in Europe offer a fixed number of points for domestic or intra-European flights regardless of the distance (but varied according to class of travel). With the introduction of airline alliances and code-share flights, frequent-flyer programs are often extended to allow benefits to be used across partner airlines.

====Bonus points====

Most, if not all, programmes award bonus earnings to premium-cabin passengers and to their elite-status members based on tier status; earning an extra 25%-100% of miles flown are common bonuses. While these bonus points may not count toward ascension to (or retention of) elite status, they count toward the member&#x27;s total balance for normal redemption purposes.

====Minimum credit guarantee====
Some programs award a full 500 points (or a similar minimum credit guarantee) for non-stop flights spanning less than 500 miles. An airline&#x27;s programme can either award this guarantee to all members regardless of elite status, or they can reserve this privilege only for their elite members.

=== Credit card purchases ===
Many credit card companies partner with airlines to offer a co-branded credit card or the ability to transfer points in their loyalty programme to an airline&#x27;s programme. Large sign-up bonuses and other incentives are common. Accruing points via credit cards bonuses and spending allows infrequent travellers to benefit from the frequent flyer programme.

With a non-affiliated travel rewards credit card a cardmember can buy a positive-space ticket considered &quot;revenue&quot; class, which can earn the passenger points with the airline flown.

===Other purchases===
Frequent-flyer programs may offer points through other means, such as purchasing food or merchandise sold by an affiliated company. American engineer David Phillips gained attention in 2000 for purchasing $3,140 of Healthy Choice pudding to earn him 1,253,000 AAdvantage miles.

== Elite status ==
Occasionally, airlines may offer double elite-qualifying mile (EQM) promotions, which speeds up a member&#x27;s status ascension (or retention) by reducing flight mileage requirements.

Some carriers also require frequent flyers to spend a set amount of money on tickets before they are eligible for elite status. This is in addition to the miles-flown requirements that are already in place. Delta switched to revenue-based elite status requirements in January 2014, United in March 2015, with American Airlines the last of the three US legacy carriers to switch on August 1, 2016. This has led to some frequent flyers devaluing those programs over others, as the changing model can be less rewarding to frequent flyers. To date no UK frequent flyer scheme has sought to operate in such a fashion, with both Virgin Atlantic and British Airways opting for the traditional method of granting tier points based on the miles flown and class of travel.

== Redemption ==
After accumulating a certain number of points, members then use these points to obtain airline tickets. However, points only pay for the base fare, with the member still responsible for the payment of mandatory taxes and fees.

===Flights===
Although a controversial topic and a source of frustration among frequent flyers, award flights are still the primary commodity purchased by members using points. While alliances and partnerships have facilitated the redemption process for some programs, award seat availability is still subject to blackout dates and seasonal fluctuations, as airlines utilize statistics, yield management, and capacity-control formulas to determine the number of seats to allocate for award booking.

This lack of availability has since been alleviated by non-airline rewards programs, such as certain credit cards (&quot;see above&quot;) and other corporate programs (Expedia Rewards, Marriott ) by allowing a member to use points to search for and purchase revenue tickets as if using cash.

=== Products and services===
Depending on an airline&#x27;s programme, members can also redeem points toward cabin upgrades, hotel stays, car rentals, and purchase of various retail items. On American Airlines&#x27; AAdvantage program for example, it is possible to pay for a complete vacation package solely with points.

===Value of points===
Travelers frequently debate on how much accumulated points are worth, something which is highly variable based on how they are redeemed. An estimate is approximately one to two cents per point based on discount (rather than full fare) economy class travel costs.

The author of an economics PhD thesis published in 2014 at Monash University, in Melbourne, Australia, examined the cash-equivalent value (purchasing power) of loyalty points, the impact of FFPs on consumer behaviour and surplus, and the taxation issues surrounding FFPs. Unlike most previous research on FFPs, this research used data from an actual FFP. The cash-equivalent value of a loyalty point in 2010 was estimated to range between AU$0.0066 and AU$0.0084. This range, however, excluded the value of status benefits to the status member. The loyalty point gained by a FFP member per flight equated to an in-kind discount on an average airfare of 3.3% for lowest status members, 3.96% for medium status members and 4.63% for premium status members. A detailed survey undertaken in 2010 among a representative sample of over 3300 members of that specific FFP showed that a large proportion of leisure and business travellers admitted a willingness to pay a higher fare—a FFP premium—to fly with the sponsoring airline because of their FFP membership. The average FFP premium was estimated to be around 8% and was statistically different between leisure and business travellers. The cash-equivalent value of a loyalty point as encapsulated in the FFP premium was estimated to range between AU$0.0108 and AU$0.0153, depending on the FFP status of a member.

The airlines themselves value points in their financial statements at less than one one-thousandth of a cent per points. That loyalty points undoubtedly have an estimable monetary value is also reflected in the fact that some programs allow for the donation of frequent-flyer points to certain charities.

== Accounting and regulatory issues ==
The frequent flyer points accumulated through business trips are a desirable employee benefit, which can encourage unnecessary travel within organisations to accumulate them and lead to superfluous personal trips.

Business travellers typically accrue the valuable points in their own names, rather than the names of the companies that paid for the travel. This has raised concerns that the company is providing a tax-free benefit (point-based awards) to employees, or that employees have misappropriated value that belongs to the company, or even that the rewards acts as a kind of bribe to encourage travellers to choose one particular airline or travel unnecessarily. Most companies consider the miles earned by their employees to be a valuable personal perk that in part compensates for the daily grind of frequent business travel, though some governmental organizations have attempted to prevent their employees from accumulating miles on official travel.

Although it has long been recognised that FFP rewards earned on employer-funded business flights should be subject to either income or fringe-benefit taxation, this is currently not taking place in the vast majority of countries - a notable exception however being Germany. One of the main arguments against the implementation of taxation is the lack of a monetary tax base. It can however be argued that since the cash-equivalent value of loyalty currency can be reasonably estimated with public data, this value is appropriate as a tax base. Hurdles preventing the taxation of FFP rewards are generally less related to the technical issue of valuation, but have more to do with legal constraints (e.g. &quot;who owns the points&quot;) and often a lack of political will (e.g. &quot;who would lose out due to taxation&quot;). Australian and German public servants are not permitted to redeem points accrued from official travel for private purposes. The Australian example occurred in the 1990s when Qantas and the now-defunct Ansett Australia competed for the Australian federal government travel contract; this was put forward as a system requirement for the competing companies in order to win the contract.

In the US, the General Services Administration has regulated, &quot;frequent traveler benefits earned [by federal employees] in connection with official travel, [which] may be used only for official travel, see 41 C.F.R. § 301-1.6(f).&quot; Frequent flyer programme contracts are not generally regulated.

===Competition===

These programmes have been studied as anti-competitive practices: in 1989, M. Tretheway found competition prevented an airline to unilaterally end its program, but the regulatory body could end all; in 1999, S. Storm observed loyalty programs were forbidden in Denmark until 1992, instated then because Danish airlines were disadvantaged, as governments can forbid these programs at industry players request and the World Trade Organization could ban all programs.

In the U.S. in 1989, Braniff wished for an end to unfair competition from frequent-flyer programs. Precedent exists for ending frequent-flyer programs. In 2002, Norway banned domestic loyalty programs to promote airline competition. In 2005, the Modernization Minister asked the competition authority to consider extending the Norwegian ban on frequent flyer miles to include all of Scandinavia. The country lifted the ban in 2013 when the competitive situation changed.

==Flight shame==
Frequent-flyer programs have been receiving scrutiny because of the prevalence and rapid growth of air travel, in terms of both the frequency that individuals fly and the tendency toward longer distance travel. In 2011, S. Cohen observed both air travel and concern over its climate impacts were growing, balanced by technology and physical resources, self and external regulation and social norms including stigmatisation of excessive air travel. In 2009, Stefan Gössling pointed out the conflict caused by air travel growth in a carbon-constrained world, with a minority of hypermobile individuals responsible for a large share of air travel.

==Mileage runs==
A &quot;mileage run&quot; is an airline trip designed and taken solely to gain maximum frequent-flyer miles, points, or elite status usually at lowest cost. If a traveler (or traveller) has already achieved some sort of elite status, then that traveler will earn bonus award miles or points on top of their actual flight miles or points. Depending on the program, that traveler will reach their goal sooner if the miles they accrue are elite qualifying miles. A mileage run may allow a traveler to (re-)qualify for a beneficial elite level, which requires a minimum number of miles to qualify. Some airlines have changed their frequent flyer rules to award miles based on ticket expense rather than absolute distance traveled, which may remove the incentive for mileage runs.

==Status challenge==
A status challenge can be an often non-publicized offer to accrue a certain amount of flying within a certain very short timeframe (usually 90 days), to earn elite status. The higher status may or may not be given immediately if it can be seen that qualifying travel (particularly travel that is non-refundable) has already been booked before the challenge was offered, otherwise higher status will be conferred once the challenge is officially completed. In some instances, a fee for a challenge may also be charged. Status challenges are employed by other types of establishments, as well, such as casinos and hotels.

==Status match==
Some airlines will match status with that of a competitor upon application, usually to airlines outside of any alliance that the airline used to match status with belongs to. This enables travellers to switch their travel more easily from one carrier to another (e.g., when the traveller&#x27;s employer switches carriers due to a new travel contract&#x27;s being signed). It does so by maintaining equivalent elite benefits with the new airline, without the need for time to pass while the traveller earns the benefits; this also has the side effect of retaining elite benefits with the previous airline, in order that one does not have to be given up for the other to allow for a more gradual transition. Status matches are employed by other types of establishments, as well, such as casinos, cruise lines, hotels, and rental car companies.

<doc id="254758" wikidata="Q4745132" url="?curid=254758" title="American Southwest Conference">
<text>The American Southwest Conference (ASC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference, founded in 1996, whose member schools compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. All member schools are located in the state of Texas. The conference competes in baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field, and women&#x27;s volleyball.

The American Southwest Conference operates from the same headquarters complex in the Dallas suburb of Richardson as the NCAA Division II Lone Star Conference.

==History==
The American Southwest Conference was announced in May 1996. The new league included some former members of the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association (TIAA). Founding members of the ASC were Howard Payne University, Austin College, Hardin–Simmons University, McMurry University, Mississippi College, Sul Ross State University, the University of Dallas and the University of the Ozarks.

The expansion soon began as the University of Mary Hardin–Baylor joined the ASC in 1997; followed by East Texas Baptist University, LeTourneau University, Schreiner University and the University of Texas at Dallas in 1998; then Concordia University Texas in 1999, and finally Louisiana Christian University, then known as Louisiana College, and Texas Lutheran University in 2000.

The University of Dallas was a member of the ASC until the end of the 2000–01 season to become a Independent; and Austin College withdrew the ASC in the 2005–06 season to join the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC). The University of Texas at Tyler began athletics in 2002 and became a member in 2003, but as a provisional member of the NCAA, was ineligible to participate in ASC or NCAA postseason tournaments until 2007. Centenary College of Louisiana joined the conference in 2011, after completing their transition from Division I to Division III, but almost immediately announced its departure for the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference.

Recently, however, several schools have announced plans to leave the conference in favor of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, which lost seven of its members at the end of the 2011–12 school year. Centenary departed at the end of the 2011–12 season after joining the ASC in that same season; Schreiner and Texas Lutheran left at the end of the 2012–13 season.

In 2012, McMurry left the ASC and completed the process of reclassifying to a full-scholarship, Division II institution and joined the Heartland Conference. Additionally, Mississippi College announced that it would be also leaving the conference and reclassifying to Division II in 2014. Mississippi College will re-join the Gulf South Conference, a league that it had been a member of until 1996.

The departures of McMurry, Texas Lutheran and Mississippi College will leave the conference with only six football playing members, below the minimum seven participating schools required to receive an automatic bid to the NCAA football playoffs. The conference has not announced a plan to maintain its automatic bid.

ASC officials announced on March 13, 2014, the forthcoming addition of McMurry University and Belhaven University to its membership. McMurry will re-join the ASC after a two-year stint in the Division II level, competing as a member of the Heartland Conference; while Belhaven is scheduled to join the ASC as a provisional member in 2015.

On December 3, 2015, ASC officials reported that Texas Lutheran University and Southwestern University would join the conference for football in 2017 as football-only members. Both schools are members of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, but the conference only had four remaining schools competing in football. Two other SCAC schools. Austin College and Trinity University (Texas), announced they would play football in the Southern Athletic Association beginning with the 2017 season. The SCAC dropped football as a conference sport after the 2016 season.

In July 2018, the NCAA approved UT Tyler&#x27;s application to begin a transition to NCAA Division II effective with the 2019–20 school year. Accordingly, UT Tyler left the ASC at the end of the 2018–19 school year. While the school did not immediately announce its future affiliation, it stated that it expected to join the Lone Star Conference. The following month, UT Tyler was officially unveiled as an incoming LSC member.

In July 2020, Louisiana College announced that it would leave the NCAA and applied to rejoin the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics after the 2020–21 school year.

More changes in the ASC membership were announced August 13, 2020, when Austin reported it would return to the conference as a football-only affiliate beginning with the 2021 season, committing to at least four years as an affiliate, then on August 19, 2021, Southwestern University announced its football program will move to the Southern Athletic Association (SAA) to start the 2023 season as an affiliate member. and on November 26, 2021, when the USA South Athletic Conference initially named Belhaven as its newest member in the 2022–23 academic year. However, on February 18, 2022, Belhaven was announced as an inaugural member of the new Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS) following a geographical split in the USA South, where the Blazers will remain as football associate members.

On November 1, 2022, McMurry University announced that it will leave the ASC in the fall of 2024 to join the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference. While on February 1, 2023, Sul Ross State University announced that it will leave the ASC in the fall of 2024 to join the Lone Star Conference into Division II. Additionally on May 15, 2023, the SCAC announced it would also be accepting Concordia and University of the Ozarks as members for the 2024–25 school year. The rapid loss of members continued, with UT Dallas announcing their intent to transition to Division II and follow fellow conference member Sul Ross State to the Lone Star Conference on July 20, 2023 and LeTourneau announcing that they would be following McMurry, Concordia, and Ozarks to the SCAC on April 25, 2024, with both changes occurring for the 2025–26 school year. If no more schools join the ASC, the conference will be down to four schools, below the minimum required to qualify for an automatic bid to the NCAA championships for those sports with 100% participation. 

David Flores was named the new commissioner of the American Southwest Conference on June 21, 2023, replacing the long-time commissioner, Amy Carlton.

<doc id="254759" wikidata="Q1189116" url="?curid=254759" title="First class travel">
<text>First class is the most luxurious and most expensive travel class of seats and service on a train, passenger ship, airplane, bus, or other system of transport. Compared to business class and economy class, it offers the best service and most comfortable accommodation.

==Aviation==
The first-class section of a fixed-wing jet airliner is typically toward the front of the aircraft. Many airlines have removed first class altogether from their international flights, offering business class as their highest level of international service. First class passengers are usually allowed into lounges at airports while they wait for their flights.

==Railways==
While first-class travel accommodation is common in intercity public transport rail services, they have become increasingly prevalent for commuters&#x27; short-distance daily travel, especially in rapid transit contexts, rather than longer-distance regional rail. Train stations in bigger cities may also offer lounges comparable to those found at airports for first class passengers or those who have a particular status in their frequent traveler programs.

===Australia===
Australia has internal rail operations in each of its states, excluding Tasmania, normally run by the State Government but in some cases is run by private operators. In each state, first class travel differs.

*NSW TrainLink (New South Wales)
First-class travel on TrainLink comes in two forms. On Xplorer and XPT trains, first-class seating is offered which include an increased legroom and seating recline over economy-class seating. On some XPT trains, first-class sleeping compartments can also be found. On day services these accommodate three people per compartment, and by night they carry two people with bunk-style accommodation.

*Queensland Rail (Queensland)
Queensland Rail offer first-class travel on many of their Traveltrain services, along with business class on their Tilt Train Services. Queensland Rail Traveltrain first class carriages provided private cabins in either roomette (single room) or twinette (double room) cabins.

*V/Line (Victoria)
First-class accommodation on V/Line is a 2×2 seating arrangement, with extra legroom and recline, only available on certain locomotive-hauled services.

*Journey Beyond (New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia)
This railway privately operates the tourist-oriented &quot;The Overland&quot;, &quot;Indian Pacific&quot;, and &quot;The Ghan&quot; services. The first class travel on these trains are branded as Platinum Service (on the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; and &quot;The Ghan&quot;) with roomette, twinette and deluxe cabins; or Red Premium Service (on &quot;The Overland&quot;) with 2x1 seating, extra legroom, and more recline than the Red Service seating.

===Canada===
The &quot;Canadian&quot; () train, operated by Via Rail, offers a Prestige class, comparable to first class. It includes room service, in-room entertainment, and a private washroom with shower. The Québec City–Windsor corridor, also operated by Via Rail, offers a business class.

===China===

China Railway and its high-speed subsidiary offer First Class on its trains, slotting in between the standard &quot;Second Class&quot; and the premium &quot;Business Class&quot; tier. First Class consists of 2 seats on each side of the aisle, with adjustable, larger-than-normal seats, footrests, and access to sockets, toilets, and water dispensers.

Aside from inter-city train services, Shenzhen Metro Line 11, which serves the regional airport, has become the first metro line in China to offer Business Class cars (making up two of the eight cars on each train). It has been reported that this service, costing three times the amount of a standard class ticket, has remained sparsely used despite overcrowding in the rest of the train.

=== Germany ===

The various private and state-owned railways in Germany featured first-class, second-class and third-class amenities from the start. Beginning in Prussia in 1852, extremely austere fourth-class coaches were introduced. After nationalization (1920) and consolidation (Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft, 1924), the fourth class was abandoned in 1928 in order to generate more revenue by forcing passengers to pay the higher prices for third-class tickets.

As those of most of the rest of Europe, the railways of East as well as West Germany moved to a two-class system in 1956. To this end, the &quot;first&quot; class was abandoned and the former second and third classes redesignated as the new first and second classes. Except for some regional and commuter train services (including some, but not all S-Bahn systems), which are second-class only, this distinction exists to this day.

The difference in amenities between the first and second class varies between train operators, services and lines. It generally translates to more legroom, tables and/or three-abreast instead of four-abreast seating for first-class passengers. On Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s national and international services, first-class passengers don&#x27;t receive a complimentary meal but on all ICE and InterCity services, passengers in first class are served the full selection of meals and refreshments at their seats, while second-class passengers can only obtain them in the dining car.
With some, primary local, services operated both by DB and other companies, there is no difference in seating between classes, with exception to the presence of armrests and tables (with ostensibly cleaner interiors in some instances) in first class. The rationale for providing first-class spaces on these services is mainly that due to the higher price, there are usually seats left in first class when all second-class seats are taken. As such, the justification of purchasing First Class on regional services, often for the average traveller, is more so dictated as offering a &quot;better-odds&quot; gamble of finding vacant seating availability on certain trains (esp. rush hour S-Bahn/regional services) rather than the availability of tangible frills in contrast to second class. While not always enforced, the rules also stipulate that even for standing room in first class, a first class ticket must be held.

=== Hong Kong ===

A First Class compartment is available on each train serving the East Rail line (formerly &quot;KCR East Rail&quot;) in Hong Kong. Instead of longitudinal, stainless steel benches offered to standard-class passengers, the first-class compartments have comfier, individual padded seating with armrests. They are arranged in pairs and oriented transversely to the compartments. Passengers are required to pay an extra &quot;first class premium&quot; (equaling to the standard adult fare of the same East Rail line journey) on top of the standard fare, and first-class compartments are regularly patrolled by ticket inspectors.

The line originated as an intercity rail service, then known as the Kowloon-Canton Railway British Section, that formerly extended into Guangdong in Mainland China. Even after the line was electrified and modernized in the early 1980s and its trains were converted to provide high-capacity, metro-style service the following decade, the fourth compartment from the north end of each trainset retained its original seating layout as a First Class compartment. In 2007, the line became part of the MTR network, and it remains the only railway line in the region to offer a separate first-class service (though the Airport Express line provides a similar travel experience in all its carriages).

===India===
A number of suburban railways in India offer first-class travel, including:
*Hyderabad Multi-Modal Transport System
*Mumbai suburban railway
*Chennai suburban railway

For intercity travel Indian Railways have 4 types of first class coaches. 
*Anubhuti Class, which is premium first class sitting coach.
*AC First Class, which is premium first class sleeper coach.
*Vistadome AC, which is basic first class sitting coach.
*Executive Chair Car, which is basic first class sitting coach.
*AC Second Tier, which is basic first class sleeper coach.

===Indonesia===
The Indonesian Railway Company operates first-class services that are officially called Luxury class services. Luxury class cars currently in operation have two different designs: the first-generation Luxury cars have a 1-1 seating formation with a dominantly woody ambience; the second-generation Luxury cars have a 2-1 seating formation with a more modern ambience and a complimentary mini bar. Both generations have audio-video on demand (AVOD) displays and a relatively better comfort than &quot;Executive&quot;-class trains.

===Japan===
The term &quot;First Class&quot; was abolished on Japanese National Railways in May 1969, and was replaced by &quot;Green cars&quot;. Green cars are identifiable by the green four-leaf clover logo—accompanied with the words &quot;GREEN CAR&quot; typeset in Clarendon—at the doorways, and all seats in these cars are reserved. Usually they are in 1-2 configuration, with 2-2 configuration for &quot;Shinkansen&quot; trains, although more exclusive accommodations have also been introduced. While &quot;green cars&quot; have traditionally been found on limited express services, in recent years, there has been a gradual trend to restore Green cars to longer-distance commuter lines in the Tokyo area, complete with &quot;Green Attendants&quot; who provide an at-seat refreshment service as well as checking tickets.

In 2011 JR East began offering a premium level of service, &quot;Gran Class&quot; on the Tohoku Shinkansen line but has since extended the Gran Class accommodations to additional lines, with plans to continue adding the Gran Class amenity to new and existing Shinkansen service. The Gran Class cabin bears similarity to the appearance of upper class accommodations found in air travel. With increased leg room, lower passenger seating density, at-seat meals chosen from a menu, unlimited beverage service, as well as additional premium offerings like warm towels, complimentary newspapers, and attendants that can be summoned via pressing a button, the level of service offered supersedes what is offered in Green Cars.

On overnight trains, premium accommodations are known as A cabins, which may be couchettes, private rooms or suites. However, the offering of overnight first class accommodations on inter-city service has largely been phased out, facing the competition from the speed and convenience offered by the continued expansion of the Shinkansen network. As of 2023, only two overnight trains that offer first class-style sleeper accommodations, the Sunrise Seto and Sunrise Izumo, still operate in regular revenue service.

Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu) refers to its first-class coaches as its &quot;myu-ticket&quot; (ミューチケット) service. These coaches are somewhat more comfortable than economy class and include assigned seating.

===The Netherlands===
Similarly to Germany, Dutch trains have had two classes since 1956. On Intercity trains, first class has a 2+1 seating, as opposed to 2+2 in second class, can recline and feature a feet rest in coach seating and have power sockets. For commuter trains both first and second class are in 2+2 layout, the difference between second and first class is in the padding of the seats, an additional armrest, decorative lighting and being more quiet due to being located at the ends of the train. Most regional trains in the rural areas only contain second class. Since 2015 all new bought trains contain power sockets in both first and second class in agreement with the government.

===Philippines===
The PNR South Long Haul project&#x27;s express trains will operate a three-class configuration starting in 2022. &quot;First Class&quot; was defined by the Philippine National Railways as being lower than business class but higher than second class. This is based on the China Railway layout and similar to the Austrian Railjet model, with First Class being more of a premium economy class equivalent for railways.

The express trainsets were ordered in late 2019 but these were cancelled by February 2021. However, these were again proposed for bidding five months after the cancellation, with the order for 21 trainsets or 63 cars scaled down to 3 trainsets or 9 cars.

A first class or similar offering is also expected to be used on the North–South Commuter Railway with the introduction of the – &quot;Airport Express Train&quot; service, which will be classified as limited express trains.

===Qatar===
The Doha Metro, which began trial service in 2019, has a &quot;Gold Class&quot; section in one end car, similar to that of Dubai (below).

===Russia===
The term &quot;First Class&quot; is not used as such by the Russian Railways, which has its own class system, but is commonly employed to translate the corresponding Russian term &quot;SV&quot; (&quot;СВ&quot; or &quot;Спальный вагон&quot;, literally &quot;Sleeping Car&quot;). Note that while technically most cars in Russian long-distance trains are sleepers (i.e. berths rather than seats), the term is used only for the first-class cars. Such cars usually have 8 or 9 two-berth compartments with transversely mounted soft couches and a TV set, two toilets on different ends of the car, and a communal shower room (in 8-compartment cars). There is also a deluxe version of the SV car, usually dubbed &quot;Premium&quot;, which features one-berth (or two-berth with foldable upper berth) compartments with a built in toilet/shower and better furnishing. This deluxe variant is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;Myagky Vagon&quot; (literally &quot;Soft Car&quot;), though this is a misnomer, as historically such designation indicated the intermediate between the SV and Coupe classes, long since discontinued, and referred to the better furnishing and softer padding of the berths as compared to the traditional Coupe class.

The service is usually the same in all classes on Russian Railways, the main difference being the increased personal space, reduced noise, and better isolation from unwanted contact with strangers, as well as better amenities; lower class cars may have a single shower per two couchette cars (54 passengers), while SV cars have one per 16 passengers, and in a Premium car each passenger has their own shower, an important consideration on lines such as the Trans-Siberian on which travel may last for up to a full week.

===Spain===

First-Class travel is not available on short-distance trains in Spain such as the Regionales or Cercanias services, but on long- and medium-distance trains such as the &quot;Altaria&quot; or &quot;Euromed&quot; services &quot;Preferente&quot; class, comparable to British first class, is available. This includes complimentary food and drinks (typically a welcome-aboard drink, including champagne, and drinks with the meal) as well as larger seats.

A further service is available on the high-speed AVE network. A club-class or preferente ticket allows access to lounges at certain stations. And onboard club-class service includes a large leather seat, power supply, à la carte food and unlimited complimentary bar service at your seat.

On all Spanish &quot;Grandes Líneas&quot; (long-haul) and Media Distancia (medium-haul) trains, video and music is available and accessed through complimentary headphones. Prices for first-class travel are not discounted other than for off-peak times of day and the price of a &quot;preferente&quot; ticket is normally only €30 - 40 more than economy, and club class on the AVE is normally only €40 more than &quot;preferente&quot; - significantly cheaper than most first-class fares in Britain.

===United Kingdom===

The existence and nature of different classes of passenger service on British trains has varied over time. From its inception, first, second, and third class carriages were provided, alongside luxury Pullman coaches. Currently, most longer-distance services offer First Class and Standard Class, whilst most local and suburban services are single class – as are urban transit services such as the London Underground.

A First Class ticket offers access to dedicated sections of the train, nearly always featuring fewer but larger, and more comfortable seats, in a generally more spacious arrangement that provides more personal space, often a table and upgraded decor/carpeting, and in some cases additional amenities (such as power outlets for mobile phones or laptop computers and as well as upgraded lighting for each set of seats).

In addition to the dedicated seating, the current First Class rail experience may include access to a passenger lounge (at major departure and/or arrival stations) and additional on-board services, such as food and/or drinks service, complimentary newspapers, free onboard WiFi etc. Such on-board services vary widely; they can be distributed by train operating company, by route, by day of week (weekday or weekend), and by time of day. The most complete First Class experience is offered by long-distance train operators, such as Great Western Railway, Avanti West Coast, London North Eastern Railway, and Transport for Wales&#x27;s &quot;Premier Service&quot;, especially on weekday morning and evening trains on high-volume routes, where it is targeted at business travellers.

On busy commuter services First Class seating is similar or identical to Standard Class. However, its much higher cost ensures the First Class ticket holder a better chance of finding a seat. Some train operating companies offer First Class fares that are often nearly double the fare of Standard Class. On some services despite the existence of a First Class cabin, it is &quot;declassified&quot; indicating that any ticket holder may sit there, and first class tickets are usually not sold.

First Class service is also offered on the overnight &quot;Caledonian Sleeper&quot; service from London to Scotland.

Eurostar international trains between Great Britain and continental Europe offer two distinct first-class services, which they call &quot;Business Premier&quot; and &quot;Standard Premier&quot; respectively, in addition to Standard Class. The on-board accommodation is the same; the difference is greater flexibility, a shorter check-in time and more extensive catering (a full meal instead of a lighter snack) for the Business Premier service. Standard Premier was introduced on September 1, 2010; formerly, this service was called &quot;Leisure Select&quot; and also included full meal catering.

===United States===
From 1863, George Pullman introduced comfortable long-distance rail cars from, what was to become the Pullman Company, founded in 1867.

Today, on Amtrak services, first-class travel is available on the &quot;Acela Express&quot; service, as well as long-distance services operated with Superliner or Viewliner stock. Passengers also have access to special waiting rooms at many cities and high-traffic stations. First class on the Acela Express service has wider seats than the standard business class (44 vs. 65 seats per carriage), in-seat electrical outlets, a carriage attendant, and complimentary meals and beverages. On the long-distance services sleeping accommodation is provided, including Roomettes, Bedrooms, Bedroom Suites, and Accessible Bedrooms. Many rooms include a shower and toilet; for other rooms a toilet and/or shower is located nearby. Meals and other hotel-style services are also included in the price.

===South Korea===
KTX (Korea Train eXpress), KTX-Sancheon (Type A, B), Saemaeul, Mugunghwa (available only in some routes) class trains operate First Class service. Called Teukshil (특실), First Class offers larger and comfortable seats. KTX and KTX-Sancheon First Class service includes complimentary mineral water, a headphone, water tissues, and a sleeping shade. Usually First Class tickets are about 50% more expensive than Economy Class tickets. First Class is located on Car 2, 3, 4 on the KTX trains, Car 3 on the KTX-Sancheon trains, and car 1 on the Mugunghwa and Saemaeul trains. ITX (Intercity Train eXpress) - Saemaeul trains do not have a First Class car.

===Switzerland===

Switzerland&#x27;s national railway company Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) as well as BLS AG and &quot;Südostbahn&quot; (SOB) offer both first- and second-class travel on all services, the only exception being the RegioExpress (RE) between and (France). Most private railway operators also offer first class travel.

First class coaches typically have fewer seats per car and therefore more indivudual space. The seats are also more comfortable compared to the second class. Some first class coaches feature larger windows, such as in Panorama Express (PE) trains. Long-distance trains typically feature a dining car between the first and second class coaches.

===Taiwan===
The Taiwan Railway Administration provided a first-class carriage on its limited express train from 1949 until 1953, when travelling classes were officially abolished.

===United Arab Emirates===

Part of one end car of trams and each Dubai Metro train is designated as &quot;Gold Class&quot;, featuring individual seats, tray tables, and luggage compartments.

==Cruise ships and liners==
Some benefits of first class on modern cruise ships include larger cabins, priority check-in, priority embarkation and disembarkation, priority meal-sitting selection, and, on premium lines, butler service.

<text>Research and development (R&amp;D or R+D), known in some countries as [[OKB|experiment and design]], is the set of innovative activities undertaken by corporations or governments in developing new services or products. R&amp;D constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or the production process.

Although R&amp;D activities may differ across businesses, the primary goal of an R&amp;D department is to develop new products and services. R&amp;D differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profit, and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain return on investment. R&amp;D is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through new products. &quot;R&amp;D&amp;I&quot; represents R&amp;D with innovation.

==Background==
New product design and development is often a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In a global industrial landscape that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary as well due to the fierce competition and the evolving preferences of consumers. Without an R&amp;D program, a firm must rely on strategic alliances, acquisitions, and networks to tap into the innovations of others.

A system driven by marketing is one that puts the customer needs first, and produces goods that are known to sell. Market research is carried out, which establishes the needs of consumers and the potential niche market of a new product. If the development is technology driven, R&amp;D is directed toward developing products to meet the unmet needs.

In general, research and development activities are conducted by specialized units or centers belonging to a company, or can be out-sourced to a contract research organization, universities, or state agencies. In the context of commerce, &quot;research and development&quot; normally refers to future-oriented, longer-term activities in science or technology, using similar techniques to scientific research but directed toward desired outcomes and with broad forecasts of commercial yield.

Statistics on organizations devoted to &quot;R&amp;D&quot; may express the state of an industry, the degree of competition or the lure of progress. Some common measures include: budgets, numbers of patents or on rates of peer-reviewed publications. Bank ratios are one of the best measures, because they are continuously maintained, public and reflect risk.

In the United States, a typical ratio of research and development for an industrial company is about 3.5% of revenues; this measure is called &quot;R&amp;D intensity&quot;. A high technology company, such as a computer manufacturer, might spend 7% or a pharmaceutical companies such as Merck &amp; Co. 14.1% or Novartis 15.1%. Anything over 15% is remarkable, and usually gains a reputation for being a high technology company such as engineering company Ericsson 24.9%, or biotech company Allergan, which tops the spending table with 43.4% investment. Such companies are often seen as credit risks because their spending ratios are so unusual.

Generally such firms prosper only in markets whose customers have extreme high technology needs, like certain prescription drugs or special chemicals, scientific instruments, and safety-critical systems in medicine, aeronautics or military weapons. The extreme needs justify the high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from 60% to 90% of revenues. That is, gross profits will be as much as 90% of the sales cost, with manufacturing costing only 10% of the product price, because so many individual projects yield no exploitable product. Most industrial companies get 40% revenues only.

On a technical level, high tech organizations explore ways to re-purpose and repackage advanced technologies as a way of amortizing the high overhead. They often reuse advanced manufacturing processes, expensive safety certifications, specialized embedded software, computer-aided design software, electronic designs and mechanical subsystems.

Research from 2000 has shown that firms with a persistent R&amp;D strategy outperform those with an irregular or no R&amp;D investment program.

==Business R&amp;D==

Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. As a result, &quot;higher R&amp;D spending does not guarantee more creativity, higher profit or a greater market share&quot;. Research is the most risky financing area because both the development of an invention and its successful realization carries uncertainty including the profitability of the invention. One way entrepreneurs can reduce these uncertainties is to buy the licence for a franchise, so that the know-how is already incorporated in the licence.

===Benefit by sector===
In general, it has been found that there is a positive correlation between the research and development and firm productivity across all sectors, but that this positive correlation is much stronger in high-tech firms than in low-tech firms. In research done by Francesco Crespi and Cristiano Antonelli, high-tech firms were found to have &quot;virtuous&quot; Matthew effects while low-tech firms experienced &quot;vicious&quot; Matthew effects, meaning that high-tech firms were awarded subsidies on merit while low-tech firms most often were given subsidies based on name recognition, even if not put to good use. While the strength of the correlation between R&amp;D spending and productivity in low-tech industries is less than in high-tech industries, studies have been done showing non-trivial carryover effects to other parts of the marketplace by low-tech R&amp;D.

===Risks===
Business R&amp;D is risky for at least two reasons. The first source of risks comes from R&amp;D nature, where R&amp;D project could fail without residual values. The second source of risks comes from takeover risks, which means R&amp;D is appealing to bidders because they could gain technologies from acquisition targets. Therefore, firms may gain R&amp;D profit that co-moves with takeover waves, causing risks to the company which engages in R&amp;D activity.

===Global===
Global R&amp;D management is the discipline of designing and leading R&amp;D processes globally, across cultural and lingual settings, and the transfer of knowledge across international corporate networks.

==Government expenditures==
===United States===

Former President Barack Obama requested $147.696 billion for research and development in FY2012, 21% of which was destined to fund basic research. According to National Science Foundation in U.S., in 2015, R&amp;D expenditures performed by federal government and local governments are 54 and 0.6 billions of dollars. The federal research and development budget for fiscal year 2020 was $156 billion, 41.4% of which was for the Department of Defense (DOD). DOD&#x27;s total research, development, test, and evaluation budget was roughly $108.5 billion.

=== Israel ===

Israel is the world leader in spending on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP as of 2022, spending 6.02%. According to CSIS, During the 1970s and 1980s Israel initially built up Israel&#x27;s research infrastructure through various programs, often in the defence industry. In 1984, a law for Encouragement of Research and Development in Industry encouraged the commercial sector to invest in R&amp;D in Israel as well as empowered the Office of Chief Scientist In the 1980s to 1992, the Chief scientist of Israel significantly expanded R&amp;D subsidies in the Israeli industrial sector. Israel invested in the creation of clusters of startups in the high-tech sector as well as venture capital investments. In 1993, Israel initiated the Yozma program, which led to the doubling of value of Israel&#x27;s 10 new venture capital funds in 3 years. In the late 1990s, Israel was second only to the US in private equity as a share of the general economy. The high tech sector in Israel, known as Silicon Wadi, which earned Israel the nickname - Start-up Nation, was ranked the 4th leading startup ecosystem in the world by Startup genome with a value of $253billion in 2023.

===European Union===
Europe is lagging behind in R&amp;D investments from the past two decades. The target of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) was meant to be reached by 2020, but the current amount is below this target. This also causes a digital divide among countries since only a few EU Member States have R&amp;D spending.

Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is open to participation worldwide.

A notable example is the European environmental research and innovation policy, based on the Europe 2020 strategy which will run from 2014 to 2020, a multidisciplinary effort to provide safe, economically feasible, environmentally sound and socially acceptable solutions along the entire value chain of human activities.

Firms that have embraced advanced digital technology devote a greater proportion of their investment efforts to R&amp;D. Firms who engaged in digitisation during the pandemic report spending a big portion of their expenditure in 2020 on software, data, IT infrastructure, and website operations. A 2021/2022 survey found that one in every seven enterprises in the Central, Eastern and South Eastern regions (14%) may be classed as active innovators — that is, firms that spent heavily in research and development and developed a new product, process, or service — however this figure is lower than the EU average of 18%. In 2022, 67% of enterprises in the same region deployed at least one sophisticated digital technology, and 69% EU firms did the same.

As of 2023, European enterprises account for 18% of the world&#x27;s top 2 500 R&amp;D corporations, but just 10% of new entrants, compared to 45% in the United States and 32% in China.

As of 2024, the electronics sector leads in R&amp;D investment, with 28% of its total investment dedicated to it. This is followed by textiles (19%), digital (18%), and aerospace (15%). Other sectors allocate less than 10% of their total investment to R&amp;D.

While 17% of the world’s top R&amp;D investors are based in the European Union, they accounted for only 1% of acquisitions involving EU-based companies between 2013 and 2023.

===Worldwide===
In 2015, research and development constituted an average 2.2% of the global GDP according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

By 2018, research and development constituted an average 1.79% of the global GDP according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Countries agreed in 2015 to monitor their progress in raising research intensity (SDG 9.5.1), as well as researcher density (SDG 9.5.2), as part of their commitment to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. However, this undertaking has not spurred an increase in reporting of data. On the contrary, a total of 99 countries reported data on domestic investment in research in 2015 but only 69 countries in 2018. Similarly, 59 countries recorded the number of researchers (in full-time equivalents) in 2018, down from 90 countries in 2015.

<text>The College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III.

CCIW schools have accounted for 50 national championships in NCAA Division III competition, including 15 in men&#x27;s cross country; six in men&#x27;s basketball; six in men&#x27;s outdoor track and field; five in football; four in men&#x27;s indoor track and field; three in women&#x27;s soccer; two in women&#x27;s outdoor track and field, women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s soccer, men’s golf, and men&#x27;s volleyball; and one apiece in baseball and women&#x27;s indoor track and field.

Elmhurst College won a pair of Division III women&#x27;s volleyball championships (1983 and 1985), and North Central College won a women&#x27;s basketball title (1983) before the conference began sponsorship of women&#x27;s athletics in 1986–87.

North Central men&#x27;s cross country won its 13th national title in program history during the fall of 2009, while the North Central men&#x27;s indoor track and field team captured the 2010 national championship. The Cardinals made their clean sweep by winning the men&#x27;s outdoor track and field title in the spring of 2010. In addition, the Illinois Wesleyan women&#x27;s outdoor track and field team, as well as the baseball team, took home national titles, giving the CCIW five national championships during the 2009–10 season.

North Central defended its titles in men&#x27;s indoor track and field and outdoor track and field in the spring of 2011 while the Cardinals won their second men&#x27;s cross country title in three seasons in the fall of 2011 and their third-straight indoor track and field title in 2012. Illinois Wesleyan won the conference&#x27;s second women&#x27;s basketball national title in 2012. 

In 2019 Illinois Wesleyan Men’s Golf won their first national championship. They followed that up with a second national championship in 2021 after a one year break due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Coached by Jim Ott to both Championships and led by Drew Pershing and Ben Johnson in 2019 and Jimmy Morton, Andrew Abel and Rob Wuethrich in 2021. 

North Central Football won the 2019 National Championship and, after the COVID year of 2020 in which no championship was held, finished second in the nation in 2021.

Carthage won consecutive men&#x27;s volleyball titles in 2021 and 2022.

==History==
The conference was formed with nine charter members (Augustana College, Carthage College, Elmhurst College, Illinois College, Illinois Wesleyan University, Lake Forest College, Millikin University, North Central College and Wheaton College) on April 26, 1946, in Jacksonville, Illinois, and opened competition in the 1946–47 academic year as the College Conference of Illinois. In 1967, the name was changed to the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin to recognize Carthage, which moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1962, and Carroll University, which entered the conference in 1955.

The CCIW sponsors 26 sports: baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s bowling, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wrestling. The most recently added sports are men&#x27;s volleyball, which started play in the 2020 season (2019–20 school year); bowling, which started play in 2020–21; and women&#x27;s wrestling, added for the 2022–23 season.

CCIW membership has experienced several changes since its inception. After Carthage left in 1952, Illinois College withdrew the following year (1953). Elmhurst and Wheaton withdrew following the 1959–60 academic year. Wheaton re-joined for all sports but football in 1967 (and for football in 1970). Elmhurst re-joined in the fall of 1967 for all sports but football (and for football in 1968). Carroll joined during the 1955 spring sports season (1954-55 academic season). Carthage returned in the fall of 1961, and North Park University entered the following fall (1962). Lake Forest dropped out at the end of the 1962–63 academic year. The last member to leave the CCIW was Carroll following the 1991–92 academic year. Carroll returned to the CCIW in 2016. In 2007, Rose–Hulman Institute of Technology, located in Terre Haute, Indiana, joined the CCIW as an associate member for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming. After 2017, Rose–Hulman left as an associate member shortly before its full-time home of the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (HCAC) announced it would add swimming.

The CCIW lost one affiliate member and gained two in 2020. Greenville University, which had moved its men&#x27;s volleyball program from the single-sport Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League to the CCIW in 2019–20, downgraded the sport from varsity to club status after that school year. With the addition of bowling, Lakeland University, a men&#x27;s wrestling affiliate since 2016–17, added bowling to its CCIW membership, while Aurora University and Marian University became affiliates in that sport. In 2022–23, Aurora and Lakeland added men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wrestling to their CCIW memberships, and Aurora also joined for men&#x27;s wrestling.

<doc id="254773" wikidata="Q181885" url="?curid=254773" title="Mikhail Glinka">
<text>Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka (; ) was the first Russian composer to gain wide recognition within his own country and is often regarded as the fountainhead of Russian classical music. His compositions were an important influence on other Russian composers, notably the members of The Five, who produced a distinctive Russian style of music.

==Early life and education==

Glinka was born in the village of Novospasskoye, not far from the Desna River in the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in the Yelninsky District of the Smolensk Oblast). His wealthy father had retired as an army captain, and the family had a strong tradition of loyalty and service to the tsars, and several members of his extended family had lively cultural interests. His great-great-grandfather was a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth nobleman, Wiktoryn Władysław Glinka of the Trzaska coat of arms who was given lands in the Smolensk Voivodeship. In 1655, Wiktoryn converted to Eastern Orthodoxy with the new name Yakov Yakovlevich (Jacob, son of Jacob), and remained the owner of his lands under the tsar. The coat of arms was originally received after his conversion from Lithuanian paganism to Catholicism according to the Union of Horodło.

Mikhail was raised by his overprotective and pampering paternal grandmother, who fed him sweets, wrapped him in furs, and confined him to her room, which was kept at . Accordingly, he became something of a hypochondriac and later in life retained the services of numerous physicians, and often falling victim to quacks. The only music he heard in his youthful confinement was the sounds of the village church bells and the folk songs of passing peasant choirs. The church bells were tuned to a dissonant chord, and so his ears became used to strident harmony. While his nurse would sometimes sing folksongs, the peasant choirs who sang using the &quot;podgolosochnaya&quot; technique (an improvised style—literally &quot;under the voice&quot;—using improvised dissonant harmonies below the melody) influenced his independence from the smooth progressions of Western harmony.

After his grandmother&#x27;s death, he moved to his maternal uncle&#x27;s estate some away, where he heard his uncle&#x27;s orchestra, whose repertoire included Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. At the age of about ten he heard them play a clarinet quartet by the Finnish composer Bernhard Henrik Crusell, which had a profound effect upon him. &quot;Music is my soul&quot;, he wrote many years later, recalling the experience. While his governess taught him Russian, German, French and geography, he also received instruction on the piano and violin.

At 13, Glinka went to the capital, Saint Petersburg, to attend a school for children of the nobility. He learned Latin, English, and Persian, studied mathematics and zoology, and considerably widened his musical experience. He had three piano lessons from John Field, the Irish composer of nocturnes, who spent some time in Saint Petersburg. He then continued his piano lessons with Charles Mayer and began composing.

When he left school his father wanted him to join the Foreign Office, and he was appointed assistant secretary of the Department of Public Highways. The light work allowed Glinka to settle into the life of a musical dilettante, frequenting the city&#x27;s drawing rooms and social gatherings. He was already composing a large amount of music, such as melancholy romances which amused the rich amateurs. His songs are among the most interesting parts of his work from this period.

In 1830, at a physician&#x27;s recommendation, Glinka traveled to Italy with tenor . They took a leisurely pace, ambling through Germany and Switzerland, before settling in Milan. There, Glinka took lessons at the conservatory with Francesco Basili. He struggled with counterpoint, which he found irksome. After three years listening to singers, romancing women with his music, and meeting famous people including Mendelssohn and Berlioz, he became disenchanted with Italy. He realized that his life&#x27;s mission was to return to Russia, write in a Russian manner, and do for Russian music what Donizetti and Bellini had done for Italian music.

His return took him through the Alps, and he stopped for a while in Vienna, where he heard the music of Franz Liszt. He stayed another five months in Berlin, where he studied composition under the distinguished teacher Siegfried Dehn. A &quot;Capriccio on Russian Themes&quot; for piano duet and an unfinished &quot;Symphony on Two Russian Themes&quot; were important products of this period.

When word reached Glinka of his father&#x27;s death in 1834, he left Berlin and returned to Novospasskoye.

==Career==

While in Berlin, Glinka became enamored of a beautiful and talented singer, for whom he composed &quot;Six Studies for Contralto&quot;. He contrived a plan to return to her, but when his sister&#x27;s German maid turned up without the necessary paperwork to cross to the border with him, he abandoned his plan as well as his love and turned north for Saint Petersburg. There he reunited with his mother, and made the acquaintance of Maria Petrovna Ivanova. After a brief courtship, they married, but the marriage was short-lived, as Maria was tactless and uninterested in his music. His initial fondness for her was said to have inspired the trio in the first act of his opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; (1836), but his naturally sweet disposition coarsened under his wife&#x27;s and mother-in-law&#x27;s constant criticism. When the marriage ended, she remarried, and Glinka moved in with his mother, and later with his sister, Lyudmila Shestakova.

&quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; was the first of Glinka&#x27;s two great operas. It was originally entitled &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;. Set in 1612, it tells the story of the Russian peasant and patriotic hero Ivan Susanin who sacrifices his life for the Tsar by leading astray a group of marauding Poles who were hunting him. Tsar Nicholas I himself followed the work&#x27;s progress with interest and suggested the change in the title. It was a great success at its premiere on 9 December 1836, under the direction of Catterino Cavos, who had written an opera on the same subject in Italy. The Tsar rewarded Glinka for his work with a ring valued at 4,000 rubles. (During the Soviet era, the opera was staged under its original title, &quot;Ivan Susanin.&quot;)

In 1837, Glinka was installed as the instructor of the Imperial Chapel Choir, with a yearly salary of 25,000 rubles and lodging at the court. In 1838, at the Tsar&#x27;s suggestion, he traveled to Ukraine to gather new voices for the choir; the 19 new boys he found earned him another 1,500 rubles from the Tsar.

He soon embarked on his second opera, &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;. The plot, based on the tale by Alexander Pushkin, was concocted in 15 minutes by Konstantin Bakhturin, a poet who was drunk at the time. Consequently, the opera is a dramatic muddle, yet the quality of Glinka&#x27;s music is higher than in &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;. The overture features a descending whole tone scale associated with the villainous dwarf Chernomor, who has abducted Lyudmila, daughter of the Prince of Kiev. There is much Italianate coloratura, and Act 3 contains several routine ballet numbers, but Glinka&#x27;s great achievement lies in his use of folk melody which becomes thoroughly infused into the musical argument. Much of the borrowed folk material is oriental in origin. When it debuted on 9 December 1842, it was received coolly, but subsequently gained popularity.

===Later years===

Glinka went through a dejected year after the poor reception of &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;. His spirits rose when he travelled to Paris and Spain. In Spain he met Don Pedro Fernández, his secretary and companion for the last nine years of his life. In Paris, Hector Berlioz conducted some excerpts from Glinka&#x27;s operas and wrote an appreciative article about him. Glinka in turn admired Berlioz&#x27;s music and resolved to compose some &quot;fantasies pittoresques&quot; for orchestra. Beginning in 1852, he spent two years in Paris, living quietly and frequently visiting the botanical and zoological gardens. He then moved to Berlin where, after five months, he died suddenly on 15 February 1857, following a cold. He was buried in Berlin, but a few months later his body was taken to Saint Petersburg and reinterred in the cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery.

===The genesis of a Russian style===
Glinka was the beginning of a new direction in Russian music. Musical culture arrived in Russia from Europe, and for the first time specifically Russian music began to appear, in Glinka&#x27;s operas. Historical events were often used as its basis, but for the first time they were presented realistically.

The first to note this new direction was Alexander Serov. He was then joined by his friend Vladimir Stasov, who became the theorist of this cultural trend; it was developed further by composers of &quot;The Five&quot;.

Modern Russian music critic Viktor Korshikov wrote: &quot;Russian musical culture [would not have developed] without...three operas—&quot;Ivan Soussanine&quot;, &quot;Ruslan and Ludmila&quot;, and &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;. &quot;Soussanine&quot; is an opera where the main character is the people; &quot;Ruslan&quot; is the mythical, deeply Russian intrigue; and in &quot;Guest&quot;, the drama dominates over the softness of the beauty of sound.&quot; Two of these operas—&quot;Ivan Soussanine&quot; and &quot;Ruslan and Ludmila—&quot;were Glinka&#x27;s.

Glinka&#x27;s work, and that of the composers and other creative people he inspired, has been instrumental in the development of a distinctly Russian artistic style that occupies a prominent place in world culture.

==Legacy==
After Glinka&#x27;s death, the relative merits of his two operas became a topic of heated debate in the musical press, especially between Vladimir Stasov and his former friend Alexander Serov. Glinka&#x27;s orchestral composition &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; (1848) was said by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to be &quot;the acorn from which the oak&quot; of later Russian symphonic music grew.

In 1884, Mitrofan Belyayev founded the annual Glinka Prize, whose early winners included Alexander Borodin, Mily Balakirev, Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, César Cui and Anatoly Lyadov.

Outside Russia, several of Glinka&#x27;s orchestral works have been fairly popular in concerts and recordings. Besides the well-known overtures to the operas (especially the brilliantly energetic overture to &quot;Ruslan&quot;), his major orchestral works include the symphonic poem &quot;Kamarinskaya&quot; (1848), based on Russian folk songs; and two Spanish works, &quot;A Night in Madrid&quot; (1848, 1851) and &quot;Jota Aragonesa&quot; (1845). He also composed many art songs and piano pieces, and some chamber music.

A lesser work that received attention in the last decade of the 20th century was Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Patrioticheskaya Pesnya&quot;, supposedly written for a contest for a national anthem in 1833. In 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Russia adopted it as the regional anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which till then was the only Soviet constituent state without its own anthem. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Russian SFSR, the hymn was retained unofficially until it was officially confirmed as the Russian national anthem in 1993, where it remained as such until 2000 when it was replaced by the Soviet anthem with new lyrics.

Three Russian conservatories are named after Glinka:
*Nizhny Novgorod State Conservatory ()
* Novosibirsk State Conservatory ()
*Magnitogorsk State Conservatory ()

Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh named a minor planet 2205 Glinka in his honor. It was discovered in 1973. A crater on Mercury is also named after him.

Glinkastraße in Berlin was named in Glinka&#x27;s honor. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, the Berlin U-Bahn station Mohrenstraße was proposed to be renamed &quot;Glinkastraße&quot;, which is adjacent to the station. The plan was cancelled due to Glinka&#x27;s reputed antisemitism.

In September 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a street in Dnipro, Ukraine, that was named after Glinka was renamed to honor Queen Elizabeth II.

==In popular culture==

The stirring overture to Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot; is heard as the theme of the long-running U.S. television comedy series &quot;Mom.&quot; Its creators felt the fast-paced, complex orchestral music reflected the characters&#x27; struggles to overcome their destructive habits and keep up with the demands of daily life.

<text>The Centennial Conference is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. Chartered member teams are located in Maryland and Pennsylvania; associate members are also located in New York and Virginia. 

Eleven private colleges compose the Centennial Conference. Five of its 11 members of the Centennial Conference rank among the top 50 national liberal arts colleges and Johns Hopkins University is ranked sixth among national universities.

On average, Centennial members sponsor 19 varsity teams. Conference members have won seventeen NCAA team titles: Johns Hopkins women&#x27;s cross country (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021), Gettysburg women&#x27;s lacrosse (2011, 2017, 2018), Haverford men&#x27;s cross country (2010), Franklin &amp; Marshall women&#x27;s lacrosse (2007, 2009), Ursinus field hockey (2006), Washington men&#x27;s lacrosse (1998), and Washington men&#x27;s tennis (1994, 1997).

==History==
According to the Centennial Conference&#x27;s website, &quot;On June 4, 1981, Keith Spalding, then-president of Franklin &amp; Marshall College, made the announcement that &quot;eight private colleges found it timely and appropriate to form a round-robin football schedule among institutions with similar attitudes and practices in intercollegiate football competition.&quot; With that statement, the Centennial Conference was born. Those private colleges were Dickinson College, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Gettysburg College, Johns Hopkins University, Muhlenberg College, Swarthmore College, Ursinus College, and Western Maryland College, later renamed and now known as McDaniel College.

The conference moved from a football-only conference to an all-sports conference after a 1991 feasibility study. The study also recommended to expand from eight schools to eleven. The other schools recommended were Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, and Washington College. Those three schools accepted and became charter members in 1992 as the conference expanded its sports offerings.

All of the charter members defected from the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC). Johns Hopkins and McDaniel College both played in the Mason-Dixon Conference prior to entering the MAC in 1975.

<text>In mathematics, an isometry (or congruence, or congruent transformation) is a distance-preserving transformation between metric spaces, usually assumed to be bijective. The word isometry is derived from the Ancient Greek: ἴσος &quot;isos&quot; meaning &quot;equal&quot;, and μέτρον &quot;metron&quot; meaning &quot;measure&quot;. If the transformation is from a metric space to itself, it is a kind of geometric transformation known as a motion.

== Introduction ==

Given a metric space (loosely, a set and a scheme for assigning distances between elements of the set), an isometry is a transformation which maps elements to the same or another metric space such that the distance between the image elements in the new metric space is equal to the distance between the elements in the original metric space. 
In a two-dimensional or three-dimensional Euclidean space, two geometric figures are congruent if they are related by an isometry;
the isometry that relates them is either a rigid motion (translation or rotation), or a composition of a rigid motion and a reflection.

Isometries are often used in constructions where one space is embedded in another space. For instance, the completion of a metric space formula_1 involves an isometry from formula_1 into formula_3 a quotient set of the space of Cauchy sequences on formula_4 
The original space formula_1 is thus isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of a complete metric space, and it is usually identified with this subspace. 
Other embedding constructions show that every metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subset of some normed vector space and that every complete metric space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subset of some Banach space.

An isometric surjective linear operator on a Hilbert space is called a unitary operator.

== Definition ==

Let formula_6 and formula_7 be metric spaces with metrics (e.g., distances) formula_8 and formula_9 A map formula_10 is called an isometry or distance-preserving map if for any formula_11,

:formula_12

An isometry is automatically injective; otherwise two distinct points, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, could be mapped to the same point, thereby contradicting the coincidence axiom of the metric &quot;d&quot;, i.e., formula_13 if and only if formula_14. This proof is similar to the proof that an order embedding between partially ordered sets is injective. Clearly, every isometry between metric spaces is a topological embedding.

A global isometry, isometric isomorphism or congruence mapping is a bijective isometry. Like any other bijection, a global isometry has a function inverse. 
The inverse of a global isometry is also a global isometry.

Two metric spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are called isometric if there is a bijective isometry from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. 
The set of bijective isometries from a metric space to itself forms a group with respect to function composition, called the isometry group.

There is also the weaker notion of &quot;path isometry&quot; or &quot;arcwise isometry&quot;:

A path isometry or arcwise isometry is a map which preserves the lengths of curves; such a map is not necessarily an isometry in the distance preserving sense, and it need not necessarily be bijective, or even injective. This term is often abridged to simply &quot;isometry&quot;, so one should take care to determine from context which type is intended.

;Examples
* Any reflection, translation and rotation is a global isometry on Euclidean spaces. See also Euclidean group and .
* The map formula_15 in formula_16 is a &quot;path isometry&quot; but not a (general) isometry. Note that unlike an isometry, this path isometry does not need to be injective.

== Isometries between normed spaces ==

The following theorem is due to Mazur and Ulam. 

:Definition: The midpoint of two elements and in a vector space is the vector . 

=== Linear isometry ===

Given two normed vector spaces formula_17 and formula_18 a linear isometry is a linear map formula_19 that preserves the norms:
:formula_20
for all formula_21 
Linear isometries are distance-preserving maps in the above sense. 
They are global isometries if and only if they are surjective.

In an inner product space, the above definition reduces to 

:formula_22

for all formula_23 which is equivalent to saying that formula_24 This also implies that isometries preserve inner products, as

:formula_25.

Linear isometries are not always unitary operators, though, as those require additionally that formula_26 and formula_27 (i.e. the domain and codomain coincide and formula_28 defines a coisometry).

By the Mazur–Ulam theorem, any isometry of normed vector spaces over formula_29 is affine.

A linear isometry also necessarily preserves angles, therefore a linear isometry transformation is a conformal linear transformation.

;Examples

* A linear map from formula_30 to itself is an isometry (for the dot product) if and only if its matrix is unitary.

== Manifold ==

An isometry of a manifold is any (smooth) mapping of that manifold into itself, or into another manifold that preserves the notion of distance between points. 
The definition of an isometry requires the notion of a metric on the manifold; a manifold with a (positive-definite) metric is a Riemannian manifold, one with an indefinite metric is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus, isometries are studied in Riemannian geometry.

A local isometry from one (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold to another is a map which pulls back the metric tensor on the second manifold to the metric tensor on the first. When such a map is also a diffeomorphism, such a map is called an isometry (or isometric isomorphism), and provides a notion of isomorphism (&quot;sameness&quot;) in the category Rm of Riemannian manifolds.

=== Definition ===

Let formula_31 and formula_32 be two (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds, and let formula_33 be a diffeomorphism. Then formula_34 is called an isometry (or isometric isomorphism) if

:formula_35

where formula_36 denotes the pullback of the rank (0, 2) metric tensor formula_37 by formula_38. 
Equivalently, in terms of the pushforward formula_39 we have that for any two vector fields formula_40 on formula_1 (i.e. sections of the tangent bundle formula_42),

:formula_43

If formula_34 is a local diffeomorphism such that formula_45 then formula_38 is called a local isometry.

===Properties===
A collection of isometries typically form a group, the isometry group. When the group is a continuous group, the infinitesimal generators of the group are the Killing vector fields. 

The Myers–Steenrod theorem states that every isometry between two connected Riemannian manifolds is smooth (differentiable). A second form of this theorem states that the isometry group of a Riemannian manifold is a Lie group.

Symmetric spaces are important examples of Riemannian manifolds that have isometries defined at every point.

==Generalizations==
* Given a positive real number ε, an ε-isometry or almost isometry (also called a Hausdorff approximation) is a map formula_47 between metric spaces such that
*# for formula_48 one has formula_49 and
*# for any point formula_50 there exists a point formula_51 with formula_52

:That is, an -isometry preserves distances to within and leaves no element of the codomain further than away from the image of an element of the domain. Note that -isometries are not assumed to be continuous.

* The restricted isometry property characterizes nearly isometric matrices for sparse vectors.
* Quasi-isometry is yet another useful generalization.
* One may also define an element in an abstract unital C*-algebra to be an isometry: 
*:formula_53 is an isometry if and only if formula_54
:Note that as mentioned in the introduction this is not necessarily a unitary element because one does not in general have that left inverse is a right inverse.

* On a pseudo-Euclidean space, the term &quot;isometry&quot; means a linear bijection preserving magnitude. See also Quadratic spaces.

<doc id="254780" wikidata="Q142375" url="?curid=254780" title="Stanstead, Quebec">
<text>Stanstead is a town in the Memphrémagog Regional County Municipality in the Estrie region of Quebec, located on the Canada–United States border across from Derby Line, Vermont.

The Town of Stanstead was created in 1995 by the merger of the former villages of Stanstead Plain and Beebe (formerly Beebe Plain) and the Town of Rock Island. It is not to be confused with the township of Stanstead, which is nearby although not directly adjacent (the municipality of Ogden lies in between). Not only is Stanstead home to the Haskell Free Library and Opera House—the only heritage building deliberately constructed straddling the border between both countries—it also features Canusa Street (Rue Canusa), one of a number of streets in the world where the country border corresponds to the middle line marker, effectively making across-the-street neighbors residents of two countries.

==History==
Prior to merging, Stanstead Plain, Rock Island and Beebe were known informally as &quot;les trois villages&quot; or &quot;the Three Villages,&quot; although originally, &quot;the Three Villages&quot; referred to Stanstead Plain, Rock Island and Derby Line, Vt., each of which ran into the next.

In 1940, traffic on Quebec Route 143—the area&#x27;s main route at the time—was halted due to snowfall from March 22 to April 3. Dufferin Heights was most affected. As volunteers attempted to clear the road with shovels, the snow banks became so high that steps needed to be carved into them. Trains were similarly affected, although able to dig out more quickly.

===Stanstead Plain===

Stanstead Plain was founded in 1796 by Johnson Taplin, who came from New England in search of good farming land.

The Mansur (red brick) one-room school was built in 1819. It is the oldest one-room school remaining in Quebec.

The town grew in the 19th century, due to the influx of United Empire Loyalists and the development of the granite industry. In 1855, the village was incorporated by the Quebec legislature. The town was the main centre of commerce of the region through the late 18th century, though eventually losing pre-eminence to Sherbrooke. Stanstead was also at one time the seat of the former Stanstead County.

The first automobile manufactured in Canada was built by Henry Seth Taylor of Stanstead. Taylor demonstrated his steam buggy at the Stanstead Fair in 1867.

The railroad reached Stanstead in 1871. Today its tracks have been transformed into bike trails owned by the regional government.

A seminary built here in 1829 became Stanstead College in 1873. In 1884, Ursulines opened a convent here which operated a Francophone college. The convent and the school both closed in 2004. The word &quot;college&quot; here designates a high school in each case. Starting 2011, the convent became an elders residence named the &quot;Manoir Stanstead&quot; (Stanstead Manor).

In 1878, the Governor General of Canada, Lord Dufferin, and his wife visited the town. The main road over which they travelled was renamed &quot;Rue Dufferin&quot; (Dufferin Street).

===Rock Island===

Rock Island was settled in 1798 by Samuel and Selah Pomroy from Massachusetts. In 1802, a bridge was built across the Tomifobia River to ease access to Derby Line. The following year, Col. Charles Kilborn built a saw mill and a corn mill, then set up a dam on the river to feed them. A few years later, a channel was dug in the bend of the river. The territory located between the channel and the river was named &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

Rock Island was incorporated as a village in 1892, and became a town in 1957.

Rock Island is known for the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, deliberately constructed on the Canada–US border and opened in 1904. The original owners were a couple with dual nationality; Mr. Carlos F. Haskell was an American businessman from Derby Line who owned a number of sawmills, while Mrs. Haskell was born in Canada. The intent was that people on both sides of the border would have use of the facility, which is now a designated historic site. Visitors today may still enter the facility from the Canadian or American sides, though those who use it as a border crossing must report to their respective customs office.

Another famous native of Rock Island is Henrietta Banting (1912–1976), the wife of Frederick Banting, co-discoverer of insulin in 1922. The Bantings donated some land to the town, and the municipal authorities recognized them by naming a public park in their honour in 1981 (located on the north side of Rue Notre-Dame Ouest (Notre-Dame West Street) going westbound towards Dufferin).

It is also the home of the Dairy Association Company, the manufacturers of Bag Balm.

The Butterfield factory closed in 1982 after a lengthy strike by Canadian workers.

===Beebe Plain===
Beebe Plain was colonized around 1789 by Zeeba Beebe of Connecticut. A saw mill was established as the town&#x27;s first business in 1863. By 1869, Beebe Plain had a church, two stores, a post office, a customs post and some houses. The village separated from the township of Stanstead and became a separate municipality. From 1874 to 1935, a Chautauqua-style holiday resort, including a meeting hall, a dining room and about 30 country cottages, attracted thousands of people, mainly Americans from New York and Boston. The granite industry is the major force in the area&#x27;s economic history.

Beebe Junction was the international crossing point for the 1870 Massawippi Valley Railway (later the Quebec Central Railway, leased by Canadian Pacific Railway and abandoned in 1990). The line ran from the Canadian Pacific mainline in Sherbrooke-Lennoxville south to Newport, Vermont, where onward connections were available via White River Junction to New York City and Boston. The last Quebec City-Sherbrooke-Newport passenger train ran in 1960. The historic Beebe station is now a private residence.

A building located at 3, Rue Principale (Main Street) is in a similar state to the Haskell Library—a line runs through its north aisle. In this case, however, Canadian citizens are not allowed to access the building without reporting to the U.S. customs first, and then to the Canadian customs when going back.

Access to homes on Rue Canusa (Canusa Street) is made through the Canada–US border. U.S. citizens residing there have to report to their customs if travelling south, and to the Canadian customs if travelling elsewhere in Beebe.

==Geography==
The Tomifobia River runs through the town of Stanstead, dividing the Canada–US border at times. Along portions of Canada&#x27;s Rue Canusa (Canusa Street), houses on the southern end of the street lie entirely within Vermont, while their driveways direct northward, and connect to the street in Quebec, as the northern portions of their properties are within Canada. These residents&#x27; backyard neighbours are American, while families living right across the street are Canadian, though no noticeable boundary exists between the two (the street itself is entirely within Canada). In other places, the international border runs through individual homes, so that meals prepared in one country are eaten in the other. An entire tool-and-die factory, once operated by the Butterfield division of Litton Industries, is also divided in two by the border.

===Climate===
As typical of southern Quebec, Stanstead has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfb) with significant differences of temperature between seasons. Summers are warm but rarely hot and are in general cooler than areas further west on similar parallels. Winters are cold considering its southerly latitude, further demonstrating the continental nature of the climate. The climate is relatively wet resulting in plenty of snowfall in winter.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Stanstead had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Population trend:

==Government==

The town of Stanstead was created in 1995 by the merger of the former towns of Stanstead Plain, Rock Island and Beebe Plain. The mayor is Jody Stone. There are six town councilors.

==Economy==
The Canadian side of the former Butterfield building is being used by small industrial businesses, such as the Sealander Waterworks as a demonstration plant for renewable energy.

==Attractions==

The Haskell Free Library and Opera House has an international border line painted on the floors of the building. Another landmark is Centenary United Church.

Stanstead, which refers to itself as the Granite Capital of Canada, was previously home to a granite-themed museum known as &quot;Granit Central&quot;. This museum closed in October 2017 citing years of financial challenges. Another museum in the town is the Colby-Curtis Museum, which is focused on the town&#x27;s history.

==Infrastructure==
Drinking water for the adjacent towns of Derby Line and Stanstead is pumped from wells in Canada, stored in a reservoir in the United States and distributed through a system maintained by Canadians. Derby Line&#x27;s sewage makes a cross-border trip for treatment.

===Roads===
*Quebec Autoroute 55
*Quebec Route 143
*Quebec Route 247

==Education==
Stanstead College is located here. There are also two elementary schools: Sunnyside Elementary School, an English school; and Jardin des Frontières, a French school. Sunnyside was built on top of the location of Sunnyside Castle, located beside the Stanstead Town Hall and across the street from the White House, a former old folks home after it was owned by Dr. White.

==Media==
The &quot;Stanstead Journal&quot;, an English-language weekly newspaper founded in 1845, was published until May 29, 2019.

==Sports==
There is a curling club which recruits members from both sides of the border. 2011 saw the construction of the Pat Burns Arena, the largest indoor hockey rink and sports complex within a 30 km radius in Canada and 20 km radius in the U.S., named after the NHL coach Pat Burns.

<doc id="254781" wikidata="Q25872" url="?curid=254781" title="Alexander Glazunov">
<text>Alexander Konstantinovich Glazunov ( – 21 March 1936) was a Russian composer, music teacher, and conductor of the late Russian Romantic period. He was director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory between 1905 and 1928 and was instrumental in the reorganization of the institute into the Petrograd Conservatory, then the Leningrad Conservatory, following the Bolshevik Revolution. He continued as head of the Conservatory until 1930, though he had left the Soviet Union in 1928 and did not return. The best-known student under his tenure during the early Soviet years was Dmitri Shostakovich.

Glazunov successfully reconciled nationalism and cosmopolitanism in Russian music. While he was the direct successor to Balakirev&#x27;s nationalism, he tended more towards Borodin&#x27;s epic grandeur while absorbing a number of other influences. These included Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s orchestral virtuosity, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s lyricism and Taneyev&#x27;s contrapuntal skill. Younger composers such as Prokofiev and Shostakovich eventually considered his music old-fashioned, while also admitting he remained a composer with an imposing reputation, and a stabilizing influence in a time of transition and turmoil.

==Biography==

===Prodigy===

Glazunov was born in Saint Petersburg, the son of a wealthy publisher. His father Konstantin was granted the status of hereditary nobility later, in 1882. He began studying piano at the age of nine and began composing at 11. Mily Balakirev, former leader of the nationalist group &quot;The Five&quot;, recognized Glazunov&#x27;s talent and brought his work to the attention of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. &quot;Casually Balakirev once brought me the composition of a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old high-school student, Alexander Glazunov&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov remembered. &quot;It was an orchestral score written in childish fashion. The boy&#x27;s talent was indubitably clear.&quot; Balakirev introduced him to Rimsky-Korsakov shortly afterwards, in December 1879. Rimsky-Korsakov premiered this work in 1882, when Glazunov was 16. Borodin and Stasov, among others, lavishly praised both the work and its composer.

Rimsky-Korsakov taught Glazunov as a private student. &quot;His musical development progressed not by the day, but literally by the hour&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote. The nature of their relationship also changed. By the spring of 1881, Rimsky-Korsakov considered Glazunov more of a junior colleague than a student. While part of this development may have been from Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s need to find a spiritual replacement for Modest Mussorgsky, who had died that March, it may have also been from observing his progress on the first of Glazunov&#x27;s eight completed symphonies (he left a ninth unfinished at his death).

===Mentored by Belyayev===

More important than this praise was that among the work&#x27;s admirers was a wealthy timber merchant and amateur musician, Mitrofan Belyayev. Belyayev was introduced to Glazunov&#x27;s music by Anatoly Lyadov and would take a keen interest in the teenager&#x27;s musical future, then extend that interest to an entire group of nationalist composers. Belyayev took Glazunov on a trip to Western Europe in 1884. Glazunov met Liszt in Weimar, where Glazunov&#x27;s First Symphony was performed.

Also in 1884, Belyayev rented out a hall and hired an orchestra to play Glazunov&#x27;s First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed. Buoyed by the success of the rehearsal, Belyayev decided the following season to give a public concert of works by Glazunov and other composers. This project grew into the Russian Symphony Concerts, which were inaugurated during the 1886–1887 season.

In 1885 Belyayev started his own publishing house in Leipzig, Germany, initially publishing music by Glazunov, Lyadov, Rimsky-Korsakov and Borodin at his own expense. Young composers started appealing for his help. To help select from their offerings, Belyayev asked Glazunov to serve with Rimsky-Korsakov and Lyadov on an advisory council. The group of composers that formed eventually became known as the Belyayev Circle.

===Fame===
Glazunov soon enjoyed international acclaim. He emerged from a creative crisis in 1890–1891 with a new maturity. During the 1890s he wrote three symphonies, two string quartets and a ballet. When he was elected director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1905, he was at the height of his creative powers. His best works from this period are considered his Eighth Symphony and his Violin Concerto. This was also the time of his greatest international acclaim. He conducted the last of the Russian Historical Concerts in Paris on 17 May 1907, and received honorary Doctor of Music degrees from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. There were also cycles of all-Glazunov concerts in Saint Petersburg and Moscow to celebrate his 25th anniversary as a composer.

===Conductor===

Glazunov made his conducting debut in 1888. The following year, he conducted his Second Symphony in Paris at the World Exhibition. He was appointed conductor for the Russian Symphony Concerts in 1896. In March of that year he conducted the posthumous premiere of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s student overture &quot;The Storm&quot;. In 1897, he led the disastrous premiere of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Symphony No 1. This catalysed Rachmaninoff&#x27;s three-year depression. The composer&#x27;s wife later claimed that Glazunov seemed to be drunk at the time. While this assertion cannot be confirmed, it is not implausible for a man who, according to Shostakovich, kept a bottle of alcohol hidden behind his desk and sipped it through a tube during lessons.

Drunk or not, Glazunov had insufficient rehearsal time with the symphony and, while he loved the art of conducting, he never fully mastered it. From time to time he conducted his own compositions, especially the ballet &quot;Raymonda&quot;, even though he may have known he had no talent for it. He would sometimes joke, &quot;You can criticize my compositions, but you can&#x27;t deny that I am a good conductor and a remarkable conservatory Director&quot;.

Despite the hardships he suffered during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War, Glazunov remained active as a conductor. He conducted concerts in factories, clubs and Red Army posts. He played a prominent part in the Russian observation in 1927 of the centenary of Beethoven&#x27;s death, as both speaker and conductor. After he left Russia, he conducted an evening of his works in Paris in 1928. This was followed by engagements in Portugal, Spain, France, England, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United States.

===Conservatory===
In 1899, Glazunov became a professor at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. In the wake of the 1905 Russian Revolution and firing, then re-hiring of Rimsky-Korsakov that year, Glazunov became its director. He remained so until the revolutionary events of 1917, which culminated on 7 November. His Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major, Op. 100, which he conducted, was premiered at the first concert held in Petrograd after that date. After the end of World War I, he was instrumental in the reorganization of the Conservatory—this may, in fact, have been the main reason he waited so long to go into exile. During his tenure he worked tirelessly to improve the curriculum, raise the standards for students and staff, as well as defend the institute&#x27;s dignity and autonomy. Among his achievements were an opera studio and a students&#x27; philharmonic orchestra.

Glazunov showed paternal concern for the welfare of needy students, such as Dmitri Shostakovich and Nathan Milstein. He also personally examined hundreds of students at the end of each academic year, writing brief comments on each.

While Glazunov&#x27;s sobriety could be questioned, his prestige could not. Because of his reputation, the Conservatory received special status among institutions of higher learning in the aftermath of the October Revolution. Glazunov established a sound working relationship with the Bolshevik regime, especially with Anatoly Lunacharsky, the minister of education. Nevertheless, Glazunov&#x27;s conservatism was attacked within the Conservatory. Increasingly, professors demanded more progressive methods, and students wanted greater rights. Glazunov saw these demands as both destructive and unjust. Tired of the Conservatory, he took advantage of the opportunity to go abroad in 1928 for the Schubert centenary celebrations in Vienna. He did not return. Maximilian Steinberg ran the Conservatory in his absence until Glazunov finally resigned in 1930.

===Emigration===
Glazunov toured Europe and the United States in 1928, and settled in Paris by 1929. He always claimed that the reason for his continued absence from Russia was &quot;ill health&quot;; this enabled him to remain a respected composer in the Soviet Union, unlike Stravinsky and Rachmaninoff, who had left for other reasons. In 1929, he conducted an orchestra of Parisian musicians in the first complete electrical recording of &quot;The Seasons&quot;. In 1934, he wrote his Saxophone Concerto, a virtuoso and lyrical work for the alto saxophone.

===Married life===
In 1929, at age 64, Glazunov married the 54-year-old Olga Nikolayevna Gavrilova (1875–1968). The previous year, Olga&#x27;s daughter Elena Gavrilova had been the soloist in the first Paris performance of his Piano Concerto No. 2 in B major, Op. 100. He subsequently adopted Elena (she is sometimes referred to as his stepdaughter), and she then used the name Elena Glazunova. In 1928, Elena had married the pianist Sergei Tarnowsky, who managed Glazunov&#x27;s professional and business affairs in Paris, such as negotiating his United States appearances with Sol Hurok. (Tarnowsky was also a noted piano teacher, whose students included Vladimir Horowitz.) Elena later appeared as Elena Gunther-Glazunova after her second marriage, to Herbert Gunther (1906–1978).

===Death===
Glazunov died in Neuilly-sur-Seine (near Paris) at the age of 70 in 1936. In 1972 his remains were reinterred at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Leningrad.

==Works and influence==
Glazunov&#x27;s most popular works nowadays are his ballets &quot;The Seasons&quot; and &quot;Raymonda&quot;, some of his later symphonies, particularly the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth, the Polonaise from &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, and his two Concert Waltzes. His Violin Concerto, which was a favorite vehicle for Jascha Heifetz, is still sometimes played and recorded. His last work, the Saxophone Concerto (1934), showed his ability to adapt to Western fashions in music at that time.
Glazunov&#x27;s musical development was paradoxical. He was adopted as an idol by nationalist composers who had been largely self-taught and, apart from Rimsky-Korsakov, were deeply distrustful of academic technique. Glazunov&#x27;s first two symphonies could be seen as an anthology of nationalist techniques as practiced by Balakirev and Borodin; the same could be said for his symphonic poem &quot;Stenka Razin&quot; with its use of the folk song &quot;Song of the Volga Boatmen&quot; and orientalist practices much like those employed by The Five. By his early 20s he realized the polemic battles between academicism and nationalism were no longer valid. Although he based his compositions on Russian popular music, Glazunov&#x27;s technical mastery allowed him to write in a sophisticated, cultured idiom. With his Third Symphony, he consciously attempted to internationalize his music in a manner similar to Tchaikovsky, to whom the piece is dedicated.

The Third Symphony was a transitional work. Glazunov admitted its composition caused him a great deal of trouble. With the Fourth Symphony, he came into his mature style. Dedicated to Anton Rubinstein, the Fourth was written as a deliberately cosmopolitan work by a Russian looking outward to the West, yet it remained unmistakably Russian in tone. He continued to synthesize nationalist tradition and Western technique in the Fifth Symphony. By the time Glazunov wrote his Seventh Symphony, his duties at the Conservatory had slowed his rate of composition. After his Eighth Symphony, his heavy drinking may have started taking a toll on his creativity, as well. He sketched one movement of a Ninth Symphony but left the work unfinished.

Glazunov wrote three ballets; eight symphonies and many other orchestral works; five concertos (2 for piano; 1 for violin; 1 for cello; 1 for saxophone); seven string quartets; two piano sonatas and other piano pieces; miscellaneous instrumental pieces; and some songs. He also collaborated with the choreographer Michel Fokine to create the ballet &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, a suite of music by Frédéric Chopin orchestrated by Glazunov.

Sergei Diaghilev briefly considered Glazunov to compose the music for his ballet &quot;The Firebird&quot; after failing to interest his first choice, Anatol Lyadov, before he eventually commissioned Igor Stravinsky instead.

===Glazunov and Stravinsky===
In his 1935 autobiography, Igor Stravinsky admitted that, as a young man, he greatly admired Glazunov&#x27;s perfection of musical form, purity of counterpoint and ease and assurance of his writing. At 15, Stravinsky transcribed one of Glazunov&#x27;s string quartets for piano solo. He also deliberately modeled his Symphony in E, Op. 1, on Glazunov&#x27;s symphonies, which were then in vogue. He used Glazunov&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, Op. 83, which was written in the same key as his, as a pattern on which to base corrections to his symphony.

This attitude changed over time. In his memoirs, Stravinsky called Glazunov one of the most disagreeable men he had ever met, adding that the only bad omen he had experienced about the initial (private) performance of his symphony was Glazunov having come to him afterwards saying, &quot;Very nice, very nice.&quot; Later, Stravinsky amended his recollection of this incident, adding that when Glazunov passed him in the aisle after the performance, he told Stravinsky, &quot;Rather heavy instrumentation for such music.&quot;

For his part, Glazunov was not supportive of the modern direction Stravinsky&#x27;s music took. He was not alone in this prejudice—their mutual teacher Rimsky-Korsakov was as profoundly conservative by the end of his life, wedded to the academic process he helped instill at the Conservatory. Unlike Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov was not anxious about the potential dead end Russian music might reach by following academia strictly, nor did he share Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s grudging respect for new ideas and techniques.

Chances are that Glazunov treated Stravinsky with reserve, certainly not with open rudeness. His opinion of Stravinsky&#x27;s music in the presence of others was another matter. At the performance of (&quot;Fireworks&quot;), he reportedly made the comment, &quot;Kein Talent, nur Dissonanz&quot; (&quot;no talent, just dissonance&quot;). (Also in the audience was Sergei Diaghilev, who on the strength of this music sought out the young composer for the Ballets Russes.) Glazunov eventually considered Stravinsky merely an expert orchestrator. In 1912 he told Vladimir Telyakovsky, &quot;&quot;Petrushka&quot; is not music, but is excellently and skillfully orchestrated.&quot;

===Glazunov and Shostakovich===
Dmitri Shostakovich entered the Petrograd Conservatory at age 13, becoming the youngest student there. He studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev and composition with Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg. He proved to be a disciplined, hard-working student. Glazunov may have recognized in Shostakovich an echo of his younger self. He carefully monitored his progress in Steinberg&#x27;s class and, in awarding him his doctorate, recommended Shostakovich for a higher degree which normally would have led to a professorship. Due to his family&#x27;s financial hardship, Shostakovich was not able to take advantage of this opportunity. Glazunov also arranged for the premiere of Shostakovich&#x27;s First Symphony, which took place on 12 March 1926 with the Leningrad Philharmonic under Nikolai Malko. This was 44 years after Glazunov&#x27;s First Symphony had first been presented in the same hall. In another instance of &quot;déjà vu&quot; with Glazunov&#x27;s early life, the symphony caused almost as much of a sensation as the appearance of the 19-year-old Shostakovich on the stage awkwardly taking his bow.

<doc id="254786" wikidata="Q1588452" url="?curid=254786" title="Haskell Free Library and Opera House">
<text>The Haskell Free Library and Opera House () is a Victorian building that straddles the Canada–United States border, in Rock Island (now part of Stanstead), Quebec, and Derby Line, Vermont, respectively. The Opera House opened on June 7, 1904, having deliberately been built on the international border. It was declared a heritage building by both countries in the 1970s and 1980s.

The library has two different addresses: &quot;93 Caswell Avenue, Derby Line, Vermont&quot;, and &quot;1 rue Church&quot; (Church Street), &quot;Stanstead, Quebec.&quot;

==Overview==
The library collection and the opera stage are located in Stanstead, but the main entrance and most opera seats are located in Derby Line. Because of this, the Haskell is sometimes called &quot;the only library in the U.S.A. with no books&quot; and &quot;the only opera house in the U.S.A. with no stage&quot;. There is no entrance from Canada; however, there is an emergency exit on the Canadian side of the building. All patrons and visitors must use the U.S. entrance to access the building. Patrons from Canada are permitted to enter the United States door without needing to report to customs by using a prescribed route through the sidewalk of rue Church (Church Street), provided that they return to Canada immediately upon leaving the building using the same route.

A thick black line runs beneath the seats of the opera house and diagonally across the center of the library&#x27;s reading room to mark the Canada–United States border. The stage and half of the seats are in Canada; the remainder of the opera hall is in the US. The building has different postal codes (93 Caswell Avenue, 05830 and 1, rue Church (Church Street), J0B 3E2) and different telephone area codes (+1-802-873-3022 and +1-819-876-2471) in its two respective countries.

=== Library ===
The library has a collection of more than 20,000 books in French and English and is open to the public 38 hours a week. French and English books are co-filed. Because of different language conventions in the direction of printing titles on spines—English books have titles written top-to-bottom, and French books bottom-to-top—the language of a book can be immediately determined.

=== Opera house ===
The opera house on the second floor was rumored to be modeled after the old Boston Opera House in a somewhat scaled down fashion (it seats four hundred), but the Boston Opera house was built afterwards. A painted scene of Venice on the drop curtain and four other scenes by Erwin Lamoss (1901) and plaster scrollwork complete with plump cherubs built in Boston ornament the opera hall and balcony in this historic building, which was constructed with walls built of granite from Stanstead.

==History==

The Haskell Free Library and Opera House was a gift from Martha Stewart Haskell and her son Horace &quot;Stewart&quot; Haskell. It was built in memory of her parents Catherine and Horace Stewart and her husband Carlos Freeman Haskell. The Haskells wanted Canadians and Americans to have equal access to the Library and Opera House and so they chose to build on the border. Construction began in 1901; the Opera House opened in 1904 and the Library in 1905.

The Haskell family later donated the building to the towns of Derby Line and Rock Island in Haskell&#x27;s memory; it is run by a private international board of four American and three Canadian directors.

The building is recognized as a historic site in both countries. In the United States, it has been registered in the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. In Canada, it was designated a National Historic Site in 1985 and has been a provincial heritage site since 1977.

Following the Trump travel ban in January 2017, the library served as a site for international reunions, as it is partly in Canada and partly in the United States. The play &quot;A Distinct Society&quot; by Kareem Fahmy is based on the family reunions that take place at the library. Officially, however, family reunions and cross-border visits are no longer allowed.

In January 2018, a man from Montreal pleaded guilty to charges related to the smuggling of handguns from Vermont into Quebec—in 2010 and 2011, he and accomplices illegally brought handguns, which had been purchased in the United States, into Canada via a scheme that involved hiding the handguns in the bathroom of the Haskell Free Library.

The library was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and did not fully reopen until spring 2022.

<text>Allopurinol is a medication used to decrease high blood uric acid levels. It is specifically used to prevent gout, prevent specific types of kidney stones and for the high uric acid levels that can occur with chemotherapy. It is taken orally (by mouth) or intravenously (injected into a vein).
Common side effects when used orally include itchiness and rash. Common side effects when used by injection include vomiting and kidney problems. While not recommended historically, starting allopurinol during an attack of gout appears to be safe. In those already on the medication, it should be continued even during an acute gout attack. While use during pregnancy does not appear to result in harm, this use has not been well studied. Allopurinol is in the xanthine oxidase inhibitor family of medications.
Allopurinol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1966. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Allopurinol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 39th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

===Gout===

Allopurinol is used to reduce urate formation in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred or is predictable. The specific diseases and conditions where it is used include gouty arthritis, skin tophi, kidney stones, idiopathic gout; uric acid lithiasis; acute uric acid nephropathy; neoplastic disease and myeloproliferative disease with high cell turnover rates, in which high urate levels occur either spontaneously, or after cytotoxic therapy; certain enzyme disorders which lead to overproduction of urate, for example: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, including Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; glucose 6-phosphatase including glycogen storage disease; phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase; adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.

It is also used to treat kidney stones caused by deficient activity of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.

===Tumor lysis syndrome===
Allopurinol was also commonly used to treat tumor lysis syndrome in chemotherapeutic treatments, as these regimens can rapidly produce severe acute hyperuricemia; however, it has gradually been replaced by urate oxidase therapy. Intravenous formulations are used in this indication when people are unable to swallow medication.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
Allopurinol cotherapy is used to improve outcomes for people with inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn&#x27;s disease who do not respond to thiopurine monotherapy. Cotherapy has also been shown to greatly improve hepatoxicity side effects in treatment of IBD. Cotherapy invariably requires dose reduction of the thiopurine, usually to one-third of the standard dose depending upon the patient&#x27;s genetic status for thiopurine methyltransferase.

===Psychiatric disorders===
Allopurinol has been tested as an augmentation strategy for the treatment of mania in bipolar disorder. Meta-analytic evidence showed that adjunctive allopurinol was superior to placebo for acute mania (both with and without mixed features). Its efficacy was not influenced by dosage, follow-up duration, or concurrent standard treatment.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
There is a correlation between uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease and mortality, and so allopurinol has been explored as a potential treatment to reduce risk of cardiac disease. However, the data is inconsistent and conflicting, and the use of allopurinol for use in cardiovascular disease is controversial. Independently of its effects on uric acid, it may also have effects on oxidative stress and inflammation.

== Side effects ==
Because allopurinol is not a uricosuric, it can be used in people with poor kidney function. However, for people with impaired kidney function, allopurinol has two disadvantages. First, its dosing is complex. Second, some people are hypersensitive to the drug; therefore, its use requires careful monitoring.

Allopurinol has rare but potentially fatal adverse effects involving the skin. The most serious adverse effect is a hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of fever, skin rash, eosinophilia, hepatitis, and worsened renal function, collectively referred to as DRESS syndrome. Allopurinol is one of the drugs commonly known to cause Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, two life-threatening dermatological conditions. More common is a less-serious rash that leads to discontinuing this drug.

More rarely, allopurinol can also result in the depression of bone marrow elements, leading to cytopenias, as well as aplastic anemia. Moreover, allopurinol can also cause peripheral neuritis in some patients, although this is a rare side effect. Another side effect of allopurinol is interstitial nephritis.

==Drug interactions==
Drug interactions are extensive, and are as follows:

* Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine: Azathioprine is metabolised to 6-mercaptopurine which in turn is inactivated by the action of xanthine oxidase - the target of allopurinol. Giving allopurinol with either of these drugs at their normal dose will lead to overdose of either drug; only one-quarter of the usual dose of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be given;
* Didanosine: plasma didanosine Cmax and AUC values were approximately doubled with concomitant allopurinol treatment; it should not be co-administered with allopurinol and if it must be, the dose of should be reduced and the person should be closely monitored.

Allopurinol may also increase the activity or half-life of the following drugs, in order of seriousness and certainty of the interaction:
* Ciclosporin
* Coumarin anticoagulants, such as warfarin (reported rarely, but is serious when it occurs)
* Vidarabine
* Chlorpropamide
* Phenytoin
* Theophylline
* Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine, mechlorethamine

Co-administration of the following drugs may make allopurinol less active or decrease its half-life:
* Salicylates and medicines that increase the secretion of uric acid
* furosemide (see more on diuretics below)

Co-administration of the following drugs may cause hypersensitivity or skin rash:
* Ampicillin and amoxicillin
* Diuretics, in particular thiazides, especially in renal impairment
* Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)

==Pharmacology==

A common misconception is that allopurinol is metabolized by its target, xanthine oxidase, but this action is principally carried out by aldehyde oxidase. The active metabolite of allopurinol is oxipurinol, which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is almost completely metabolized to oxipurinol within two hours of oral administration, whereas oxipurinol is slowly excreted by the kidneys over 18–30 hours. For this reason, oxipurinol is believed responsible for the majority of allopurinol&#x27;s effect.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) and is an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine (1H-Purine-2,6-dione) oxidase is responsible for the successive oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and subsequently uric acid, the product of human purine metabolism. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine. While xanthine cannot be converted to purine ribonucleotides, hypoxanthine can be salvaged to the purine ribonucleotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribonucleotides may cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol, therefore, decreases uric acid formation and may also inhibit purine synthesis.

===Pharmacogenetics===
The HLA-B*5801 allele is a genetic marker for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The frequency of the HLA-B*5801 allele varies between ethnicities: Han Chinese and Thai populations have HLA-B*5801 allele frequencies of around 8%, as compared to European and Japanese populations, who have allele frequencies of around 1.0% and 0.5%, respectively. The increase in risk for developing allopurinol-induced SJS or TEN in individuals with the HLA-B*5801 allele (as compared to those who do not have this allele) is very high, ranging from a 40-fold to a 580-fold increase in risk, depending on ethnicity. As of 2011 the FDA-approved drug label for allopurinol did not contain any information regarding the HLA-B*5801 allele, though FDA scientists did publish a study in 2011 which reported a strong, reproducible and consistent association between the allele and allopurinol-induced SJS and TEN. However, the American College of Rheumatology recommends screening for HLA-B*5801 in high-risk populations (&quot;e.g.&quot; Koreans with stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease and those of Han Chinese and Thai descent), and prescribing patients who are positive for the allele an alternative drug. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines state that allopurinol is contraindicated in known carriers of the HLA-B*5801 allele.

== History ==
Allopurinol was first synthesized and reported in 1956 by Roland K. Robins (1926–1992), in a search for antineoplastic agents. Allopurinol inhibits the breakdown (catabolism) of the thiopurine drug mercaptopurine, and was later tested by Wayne Rundles in collaboration with Gertrude Elion&#x27;s lab at Wellcome Research Laboratories to see if it could improve treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by enhancing the action of mercaptopurine. However, no improvement in leukemia response was noted with mercaptopurine-allopurinol co-therapy, so that work turned to other compounds and the team then started testing allopurinol as a potential therapeutic for gout. Allopurinol was first marketed as a treatment for gout in 1966.

==Society and culture==
===Formulations===
Allopurinol is sold as an injection for intravenous use and as a tablet.

===Brands===

Allopurinol has been marketed in the United States since 19 August 1966, when it was first approved by FDA under the trade name Zyloprim. Allopurinol was marketed at the time by Burroughs Wellcome. Allopurinol is a generic drug sold under a variety of brand names, including Allohexal, Allosig, Milurit, Alloril, Progout, Ürikoliz, Zyloprim, Zyloric, Zyrik, and Aluron.

<text>The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known by its Latin title Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis or simply the Lemegeton, is an anonymously authored grimoire on sorcery, mysticism and magic. It was compiled in the mid-17th century, mostly from materials several centuries older. It is divided into five books: the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;, &quot;Ars Theurgia-Goetia&quot;, &quot;Ars Paulina&quot;, &quot;Ars Almadel&quot;, and &quot;Ars Notoria&quot;. It is based on the Testament of Solomon and the ring mentioned within it that he used to seal demons.

=== Terminology ===

The text is more properly called &quot;, or, The little Key of Solomon&quot;. The title most commonly used, &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, does not in fact occur in the manuscripts. A. E. Waite, in his 1898 &quot;Book of Black Magic and of Pacts&quot; does use the terms &quot;so-called Greater Key&quot; and &quot;Lesser Key&quot; to distinguish between the Clavicula Salomonis and Lemegeton, so he may have been the one to coin it. The Latin term refers to the evocation of demons or evil spirits. It is derived from the Ancient Greek word () meaning &quot;charm&quot;, &quot;witchcraft&quot;, or &quot;jugglery&quot;.
In medieval and Renaissance Europe, was generally considered evil and heretical, in contrast to (theurgy) and (natural magic), which were sometimes considered more noble. Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, in his &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot;, writes, &quot;Now the parts of ceremonial magic are goetia and theurgia. Goetia is unfortunate, by the commerces of unclean spirits made up of the rites of wicked curiosities, unlawful charms, and deprecations, and is abandoned and execrated by all laws.&quot;

===Sources===
The most obvious source for the is Johann Weyer&#x27;s in his . Weyer does not cite, and is unaware of, any other books in the , suggesting that the was derived from his work, not the other way around. The order of the spirits changed between the two, four additional spirits were added to the later work, and one spirit (Pruflas) was omitted. The omission of Pruflas, a mistake that also occurs in an edition of cited in Reginald Scot&#x27;s &quot;The Discovery of Witchcraft&quot;, indicates that the could not have been compiled before 1570. Indeed, it appears that the is more dependent upon Scot&#x27;s translation of Weyer than on Weyer&#x27;s work in itself. Additionally, some material came from Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot;, the by pseudo-Pietro d&#x27;Abano, and the &quot;Magical Calendar&quot;.

Weyer&#x27;s , which is likely related to a 1583 manuscript titled &quot; The Office of Spirits&quot;, appears to have ultimately been an elaboration on a 15th-century manuscript titled (30 of the 47 spirits are nearly identical to spirits in the ).

In a slightly later copy made by Thomas Rudd (1583?–1656), this portion was labeled , and the seals and demons were paired with those of the 72 angels of the which were intended to protect the conjurer and to control the demons he summoned. The angelic names and seals derived from a manuscript by Blaise de Vigenère, whose papers were also used by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (1854–1918) in his works for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1887–1903). Rudd may have derived his copy of from a now-lost work by Johannes Trithemius, who taught Agrippa, who in turn taught Weyer.

This portion of the work was later translated by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and published by Aleister Crowley in 1904 under the title &quot;The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King&quot;. Crowley added some additional invocations previously unrelated to the original work (including some evocations in the Enochian language), as well as essays describing the rituals as psychological exploration instead of demon summoning.

=== The seventy-two demons ===

The demons&#x27; names (given below) are taken from the , which differs in terms of number and ranking from the of Weyer. As a result of multiple translations, there are multiple spellings for some of the names, which are given in the articles concerning them. The demons Vassago, Seere, Dantalion, and Andromalius are new additions in that are not present in the that it is based upon. In contrast, the demon Pruflas appears in the but not in .

A footnote in one variant edition lists the kings of the cardinal directions as Oriens or Uriens, Paymon or Paymonia, Ariton or Egyn, and Amaymon or Amaimon, alternatively known as Samael, Azazel, Azael, and Mahazael (purportedly their preferred rabbinic names). Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;Occult Philosophy&quot; lists the kings of the cardinal directions as Urieus (east), Amaymon (south), Paymon (west), and Egin (north); again providing the alternate names Samuel (i.e. Samael), Azazel, Azael, and Mahazuel. The Magical Calendar lists them as Bael, Moymon, Poymon, and Egin, though Peterson notes that some variant editions instead list: &quot;Asmodel in the east, Amaymon in the south, Paymon in the west, and Aegym in the north&quot;; &quot;Oriens, Paymon, Egyn, and Amaymon&quot;; or &quot;Amodeo (king of the east), Paymon (king of the west), Egion (king of the north), and Maimon.&quot;
The mostly derives from Trithemius&#x27;s , though the seals and order of the spirits are different due to corrupted transmission via manuscript. Rituals not found in were added, in some ways conflicting with similar rituals found in the and . Most of the spirits summoned are tied to compass points: four emperors are tied to the cardinal points (Carnesiel in the east, Amenadiel in the west, Demoriel in the north, and Caspiel in the south); and sixteen dukes are tied to cardinal points, inter-cardinal points, and additional directions between those. There are eleven &quot;wandering princes&quot;, so a total of thirty-one spirit leaders each rule several spirits, up to a few dozen.

Derived from book three of Trithemius&#x27;s and from portions of the , but purportedly delivered by Paul the Apostle instead of (as claimed by Trithemius) Raziel. Elements from &quot;The Magical Calendar&quot;, astrological seals by Robert Turner&#x27;s 1656 translation of Paracelsus&#x27;s &quot;Archdiocese of Magic&quot;, and repeated mentions of guns and the year 1641 indicate that this portion was written in the later half of the seventeenth century. Traditions of Paul communicating with heavenly powers are almost as old as Christianity itself, as seen in some interpretations of 2  Corinthians 12:2–4 and the apocryphal &quot;Apocalypse of Paul&quot;. The is in turn divided into two books, the first detailing twenty-four angels aligned with the twenty-four hours of the day, the second (derived more from the Heptameron) detailing the 360 spirits of the degrees of the zodiac.
Mentioned by Trithemius and Weyer, the latter of whom claimed an Arabic origin for the work. A 15th-century copy is attested to by Robert H. Turner, and Hebrew copies were discovered in the 20th century. The instructs the magician on how to create a wax tablet with specific designs intended to contact angels via scrying.

The , or &quot;The Notory Art, which the Almighty Creator Revealed to Solomon,&quot; is a seventeenth-century composite text consisting of two separate and imperfect magical texts, the fourteenth century &quot;Ars Notoria&quot;, or the &quot;Notory Art&quot; (glossed version), and the mid-fourteenth century &quot;Ars Brevis&quot;, or the &quot;Short Art&quot;. From the original &quot;Ars Notoria&quot; (glossed version), the compiler of the &quot;Ars Notoria, quam Creator Altissimus Salomoni revelavit&quot; presents a new rearrangement of a series of mysteriously formulated prayers (which are also found in the London manuscript of &quot;The Sworn Book of Honorius&quot;) intended to enhance the mental faculties, such as memory, eloquence, and understanding, of the magician. Some editions of the contain the 1657 English translation of &quot;The Notory Art, which the Almighty Creator Revealed to Solomon&quot; being published and retitled by Robert Turner of Holshott as &quot;Ars Notoria: The Notory Art of Solomon, Shewing the Cabalistical Key of Magical Operations, The liberal Sciences, Divine Revelation, and The Art of Memory.&quot; Other editions of the &quot;Lemegeton&quot; omit this work entirely; A. E. Waite ignores it completely when describing the .

Rucker was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, son of Embry Cobb Rucker Sr (October 1, 1914 - August 1, 1994), who ran a small furniture-manufacture company and later became an Episcopal priest and community activist, and Marianne (née von Bitter). The Rucker family were of Huguenot descent. Through his mother, he is a great-great-great-grandson of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

Rucker attended St. Xavier High School before earning a BA in mathematics from Swarthmore College (1967) and MS (1969) and PhD (1973) degrees in mathematics from Rutgers University.

==Career==
Rucker taught mathematics at the State University of New York at Geneseo from 1972 to 1978. Although he was liked by his students and &quot;published a book [&quot;Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension&quot;] and several papers,&quot; several colleagues took umbrage at his long hair and convivial relationships with English and philosophy professors amid looming budget shortfalls; as a result, he failed to attain tenure in the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; department.

Thanks to a grant from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Rucker taught at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg from 1978 to 1980. He then taught at Randolph-Macon Women&#x27;s College in Lynchburg, Virginia from 1980 to 1982, before trying his hand as a full-time author for four years.

Inspired by an interview with Stephen Wolfram, Rucker became a computer science professor at San José State University in 1986, from which he retired as professor emeritus in 2004.

From 1988 to 1992 he was hired by John Walker of Autodesk as a programmer of cellular automata, which inspired his book &quot;The Hacker and the Ants&quot;.

A mathematician with philosophical interests, he has written &quot;The Fourth Dimension&quot; and &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot;. Princeton University Press published new editions of &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot; in 1995 and in 2005, both with new prefaces; the first edition is cited with fair frequency in academic literature.

As his &quot;own alternative to cyberpunk,&quot; Rucker developed a writing style he terms transrealism. Transrealism, as outlined in his 1983 essay &quot;The Transrealist Manifesto&quot;, is science fiction based on the author&#x27;s own life and immediate perceptions, mixed with fantastic elements that symbolize psychological change. Many of Rucker&#x27;s novels and short stories apply these ideas. One example of Rucker&#x27;s transreal works is &quot;Saucer Wisdom&quot;, a novel in which the main character is abducted by aliens. Rucker and his publisher marketed the book, tongue in cheek, as non-fiction.

His earliest transreal novel, &quot;White Light&quot;, was written during his time at Heidelberg. This transreal novel is based on his experiences at SUNY Geneseo.

Rucker often uses his novels to explore scientific or mathematical ideas; &quot;White Light&quot; examines the concept of infinity, while the Ware Tetralogy (written from 1982 through 2000) is in part an explanation of the use of natural selection to develop software (a subject also developed in his &quot;The Hacker and the Ants&quot;, written in 1994). His novels also put forward a mystical philosophy that Rucker has summarized in an essay titled, with only a bit of irony, &quot;The Central Teachings of Mysticism&quot; (included in &quot;Seek!&quot;, 1999).

His non-fiction book, &quot;The Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning Of Life, and How To Be Happy&quot; summarizes the various philosophies he&#x27;s believed over the years and ends with the tentative conclusion that we might profitably view the world as made of computations, with the final remark, &quot;perhaps this universe is perfect.&quot;

==Personal life==
Rucker was the roommate of Kenneth Turan during his freshman year at Swarthmore College. In 1967, Rucker married Sylvia Bogsch Rucker (1943–2023). Together they have three children. On July 1, 2008, Rucker suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. Thinking he might not be around much longer, this prompted him to write &quot;Nested Scrolls&quot;, his autobiography.

Rucker resided in Highland Park, New Jersey during his graduate studies at Rutgers University.

<doc id="254814" wikidata="Q1060437" url="?curid=254814" title="List of house types">
<text>This is a list of house types. Houses can be built in a large variety of configurations. A basic division is between free-standing or single-family detached homes and various types of attached or multi-family residential dwellings. Both may vary greatly in scale and the amount of accommodation provided.

== By layout ==

==Hut==
A hut is a dwelling of relatively simple construction, usually one room and one story in height. The design and materials of huts vary widely around the world.
==Bungalow==
Bungalow is a common term applied to a low one-story house with a shallow-pitched roof (in some locations, dormered varieties are referred to as 1.5-story, such as the chalet bungalow in the United Kingdom). 
==Cottage==
A cottage is a small house, usually one or two stories in height, although the term is sometimes applied to larger structures.
==Ranch==

A ranch-style house or rambler is one-story, low to the ground, with a low-pitched roof, usually rectangular, L- or U-shaped with deep overhanging eaves. Ranch styles include:
* California ranch: the &quot;original&quot; ranch style, developed in the United States in the early 20th century, before World War II
* Tract ranch: a post-World War II style of ranch that was smaller and less ornate than the original, mass-produced in housing developments, usually without basements
* Suburban ranch: a modern style of ranch that retains many of the characteristics of the original but is larger, with modern amenities

==I-house==

An I-house is a two or three-story house that is one room deep with a double-pen, hall-parlor, central-hall or saddlebag layout.
* New England I-house: characterized by a central chimney
* Pennsylvania I-house: characterized by internal gable-end chimneys at the interior of either side of the house
* Southern I-house: characterized by external gable-end chimneys on the exterior of either side of the house

==Gablefront==

A gablefront house or gablefront cottage has a gable roof that faces its street or avenue, as in the novel &quot;The House of Seven Gables&quot;.
* A-frame: so-called because the steep roofline, reaching to or near the ground, makes the gable ends resemble a capital letter A.
* Chalet: a gablefront house built into a mountainside with a wide sloping roof
* Charleston single house: originating in Charleston, South Carolina, a narrow house with its shoulder to the street and front door on the side.
*Upright and Wing: a style originating in New England (particularly Upstate New York) and the Great Lakes states, usually of a Greek Revival style.

==Split-level==

Split-level house is a design of house that was commonly built during the 1950s and 1960s. It has two nearly equal sections that are located on two different levels, with a short stairway in the corridor connecting them.
* Bi-level, split-entry, or raised ranch
* Tri-level, quad-level, quintlevel etc.

==Tower==

A tower house is a compact two or more story house, often fortified.
* Irish tower houses were often surrounded by defensive walls called bawns
* Kulla: an Albanian tower house
* Peel tower or Pele tower: fortified tower houses in England and Scotland used as keeps or houses
* Vainakh tower: a tower house found in Chechenya and Ingushetia that reached up to four stories tall and were used for residential or military purposes, or both

<doc id="254819" wikidata="Q1999889" url="?curid=254819" title="Battle of Santiago de Cuba">
<text>The Battle of Santiago de Cuba was a decisive naval engagement that occurred on July 3, 1898 between an American fleet, led by William T. Sampson and Winfield Scott Schley, against a Spanish fleet led by Pascual Cervera y Topete, which occurred during the Spanish–American War. The significantly more powerful US Navy squadron, consisting of four battleships and two armored cruisers, decisively defeated an outgunned squadron of the Royal Spanish Navy, consisting of four armored cruisers and two destroyers. All of the Spanish ships were sunk for no American loss. The crushing defeat sealed the American victory in the Cuban theater of the war, ensuring the independence of Cuba from Spanish rule.

Tensions between Spain and the United States worsened over the Spanish conduct during their efforts to quell the Cuban War of Independence, with many Americans being agitated by largely exaggerated reports of Spanish atrocities against the Cubans. In January 1898, fearing the fate of American interests in Cuba from the war, the cruiser USS &quot;Maine&quot; was dispatched to protect them. Less than a month later, the cruiser exploded while lying at anchor in Havana harbor, killing 266 sailors and inflaming American opinion with Spain being portrayed as the culprit in the American media at the time, despite the fact that the actual cause of the explosion was never conclusively determined. Two months later, war was declared.

The Americans realized that defeating a significant Spanish squadron then stationed in Cuba was vital to ensuring victory in the war. A squadron consisting of six warships was dispatched to ensure success, commanded by both Sampson and Schley, each admiral having his own approach to naval warfare. On July 3, the Spanish squadron steamed out of the harbor to engage with the Americans. The Spanish, totally unprepared and outgunned, made a desperate attempt to reach the open sea with the American battleships and cruisers in hot pursuit. The entire Spanish squadron was sunk with minimal casualties for the Americans, who suffered only two men killed or wounded.

The Americans pulled a total of 1889 Spanish sailors from the water, among them Cervera. The captured Spaniards were treated with respect and care by the Americans, and Cervera gained respect from the American officers for his dignified conduct during and after the battle. Although the battle ensured the American campaign in Cuba would end in a success, tensions soon arose between Sampson and Schley, with various parties in the US Navy and the American public debating over which admiral had made the greater contribution to victory, and the dispute reached the desk of Theodore Roosevelt. The battle remains one of the most significant naval battles in US maritime history.

==Background==
===Preliminary context===
The battle marked the culmination of the Cuban Wars for Independence, which had been waged by Cuban revolutionaries against Spanish imperial power for several decades. The United States had political, economic, cultural, and ideological interests in Cuba. Within the larger context, many American political leaders, pushed by interventionist public opinion, were outraged by the publication of a private letter by Spanish Minister Enrique Dupuy de Lôme critical of US President William McKinley and by the destruction of the American armored cruiser that was touted by newspapers at the time as the &quot;Battleship Maine&quot; for which a naval court of inquiry and American yellow journalism blamed Spain.

Cuban revolutionaries had staged revolts against Spanish colonial authority in the Ten Years&#x27; War (1868–1878), the Little War (1879–1880), and the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898). During the last war, Spanish General Valeriano Weyler established a policy of interning Cubans in camps he called &quot;reconcentrados&quot;, which functioned as internment camps. The etymology behind the &quot;re-&quot; prefix is that formerly the Cubans lived in villages but now they were going to be redistributed into new villages under the hypocritical pretext that it was for their own protection. Spanish forces gathered Cubans who lived in the countryside and centralized them in camps, where they could be monitored. As a consequence, many Cubans died of disease and malnutrition. That policy did as much to paint the Spanish as barbarians to the Cuban natives and the United States as any other item of misrule by the Spanish.

With outrage over Weyler&#x27;s seemingly-brutal policy and sympathy with the Cubans&#x27; struggle building, US public opinion pushed for war with Spain after the publication of the de Lôme Letter in February. Enrique Dupuy de Lôme had been appointed the Spanish Minister to the United States in 1892. In that capacity, it was his duty to refrain from allowing his personal beliefs to intervene with his public duty to support peaceful diplomatic relations between the United States and Spain. However, a letter that expressed his opposition to McKinley&#x27;s foreign policy decisions was exposed, and the &quot;New York Journal&quot; translated and printed the letter. Many Americans considered it an insult to the nation and to the president.

Although Spain apologized on February 13, 1898, &quot;Maine&quot; exploded and sank in Havana Harbor, Cuba, two days later and killed 266 American sailors. After a hasty naval court of inquiry, the American press blamed Spain and accused it of planting a mine that sank the battleship. The war with Spain became known as the &quot;Correspondents&#x27; War&quot;. Journalists not only wrote stories about the conflict but also took part in the fight. In 1898, the prestige of the press ran high.

American society was changing as literacy rates increased. There was a new revolution of readers. As war zones became more open to the press, journalists wrote eyewitness accounts of what was happening. In an era before radio and television, newspapers were the main source of information, opinion, and entertainment for the American public. In New York City, where the population was about 2,800,000, the combined circulation of daily papers was about 2,000,000.

In response to the public&#x27;s outcry, McKinley took action against Spain. On April 25, the United States declared war and claimed to have had no self-serving interest in Cuba, but some political and military leaders and imperialists believed that war would be an opportunity for the United States to expand territories overseas and to demonstrate its increasing naval power against a weak foe. Moreover, the United States sought to expand economic ties with Cuba for its resources in sugar and tobacco, all of which influenced America&#x27;s decision to intervene. It was evident that gaining territories across the globe would increase US strength and influence and tap markets for the products of American industry.

Spanish Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta did not seek war with the United States. He did not expect victory but knew that Spanish citizens would likely revolt if he conceded to American demands in Cuba. Meanwhile, Spanish naval leaders tried to employ a strategy that would not win the war outright but resist the US Navy as much as possible. On May 1, 1898, American and Spanish naval forces met in the Philippines at the Battle of Manila Bay, which resulted in a decisive victory for the United States. The Spanish government sent their fleet, under Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete, to defend Cuba and keep an open line of communication with the Spanish garrison there. Cervera opposed that strategy since he believed his squadron lacked the strength necessary to engage the American squadron. He preferred to engage the Americans near the Canary Islands or to mount an attack against the American coast, but he was overruled by his superiors in Madrid. Cervera&#x27;s own misgivings reveal the seriousness of the situation faced:
:It is impossible for me to give you an idea of the surprise and consternation experienced by all on the receipt of the order to sail. Indeed, that surprise is well justified, for nothing can be expected of this expedition except the total destruction of the fleet or its hasty and demoralized return.

Lacking a clear strategy, the Spanish policymakers at home may have hoped to end the war quickly in a &quot;glorious defeat&quot; against the more powerful US Navy. Cervera knew better but like a good officer followed orders to the letter. There is a hint of his real views in his attack orders to the fleet. He suggests they nail their flags to the masts; that is, not even to think about lowering them in surrender. As the fleet was being massacred against superior firepower, some captains in fact ran their ships aground and surrendered to save what was left of their men.

===Spanish fleet===
Before taking command of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron, Cervera had served a variety of military and political roles, then retired after a dispute with opposing politicians. However, when war against the United States broke, Cervera was recalled into the Spanish Navy and given command of the Caribbean Squadron. The squadron was to be dispatched from Spain with the ultimate destination of the Caribbean, initially Puerto Rico but then changed to Cuba, to reinforce the Spanish garrison, defend the island from American invasion, and break the American naval blockade. Before the outbreak of war, Cervera attempted to inform Spanish officials of the Spanish Navy&#x27;s weakness relative to the US Navy. Captain Fernando Villaamil, the Second Officer in the Ministry of the Navy and a pioneer in destroyer warfare, disagreed with Cervera&#x27;s passivity and advocated Spain to offset American naval superiority by scattering the fleet and taking the initiative through quick and dispersed actions. A lack of consensus between Cervera, Villaamil, and the Spanish government put Spanish naval strategy in flux from the beginning.
On April 29, Cervera steamed from Cape Verde. Panic gripped the American people, who did not know what his ships might do: attack the largely-undefended East Coast while the fleet sailed about in an effort to engage him; prey upon American shipping; or perhaps sail up the Potomac and set fire to Washington, DC. Ultimately, Cervera did none of those but managed to evade the US fleet for several weeks, confounded his American counterparts, and recoaled in the process before he finally sought refuge in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba. On May 29, 1898, an American squadron sighted Cervera&#x27;s newest ship, the cruiser , and immediately established a blockade around the mouth of the harbor. The Spanish soon found themselves &quot;blockaded closely by an American semicircle of ships about six miles from the Morro by day, and moving discreetly closer after nightfall.&quot; Moreover, by early July, the Spanish were nearly surrounded at Santiago from the east by an advancing American army numbering some 16,000 soldiers, 3,000 Cuban insurgents to the west, and the American fleet to the south.

The Spanish squadron consisted of the cruisers , , , and &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; in addition to Villaamil&#x27;s destroyers and . The cruisers displaced approximately 7,000 tons each, but they were not heavily armored, and their armament did not match the Americans. With the exception of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, which was more lightly armed, the cruisers&#x27; main armament consisted of two guns each and a secondary armament of ten guns. Cervera&#x27;s fleet was at a further disadvantage relative to the Americans because of the condition of its ships. The breech mechanisms in many of the Spanish guns were dangerously faulty and caused jams and other mishaps. Many of the ships&#x27; boilers were in need of repair. Several ships, including &quot;Viscaya&quot;, desperately needed bottom-cleaning as they were suffering from extra drag from fouling. The most well-protected ship in Cervera&#x27;s fleet, the second-generation armored cruiser &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, had not even had her main battery installed and carried wooden dummy guns instead.

Finally, Cervera&#x27;s crews were poorly trained. They lacked experience and practice in gunnery drills, and their training had emphasized rapid fire at regular intervals but the Americans favored more deliberately-aimed fire. Relative to the Americans&#x27; fleet, which consisted mainly of modern battleships, Cervera&#x27;s force was lightly armed, a result of recent budget cuts but also a naval policy that for many years favored the construction of light swift ships to patrol the far-flung oceanic empire.
With Cervera&#x27;s fleet bottled in Santiago, Captain General Ramon Blanco y Erenas, the top military commander in Cuba, ordered it to sortie from the harbor along the coast westward to Cienfuegos. In Cervera&#x27;s eyes, escape from the bay seemed nearly impossible. He strongly considered fleeing under protection of night but opted to sail by day instead to ensure the safe navigation of his ships through Santiago&#x27;s narrow channel. On July 3, 1898, Cervera, aboard his flagship &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot;, led the Spanish fleet out of the safety of the Santiago harbor at 7 min intervals.

===American fleet===
The primary elements of the American forces in Cuban waters were initially divided between two commands: Rear Admiral William T. Sampson of the North Atlantic Squadron and Commodore Winfield Scott Schley, commanding the &quot;Flying Squadron&quot;. Although the two combined squadrons outnumbered the Spanish fleet, victory was not achieved solely by American numerical superiority. Rather, victory resulted from strategic and tactical decisionmaking in addition to the general superiority of the American forces. As the historian James C. Rentfrow argues, the American victory at Santiago was, in many ways, the culmination of an &quot;ongoing process towards [the North Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s] construction as a combat unit.&quot;

At the head of the American fleet were Sampson&#x27;s armored cruiser and Schley&#x27;s armored cruiser . &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn,&quot; although only armored cruisers, were well-armed for their class. Schley&#x27;s flagships were powerful cruisers, but the primary firepower of the American fleet resided in its battleships , , , and . The American battleships were modern steam-powered and steel-hulled coast defense battleships all built within the decade. The oldest and least powerful of them was &quot;Texas,&quot; a near-sister ship to the &quot;Maine&quot;, which had exploded in Havana Harbor in February. The ships were armed with and guns and could steam at speeds up to . Off Santiago, Schley&#x27;s &quot;Flying Squadron&quot; was merged into the larger fleet under Sampson&#x27;s overall command.

To bolster the force, US Navy Secretary John D. Long ordered the battleship to sail from Mare Island, California, to join the fleet in the Caribbean. The &quot;West coast&#x27;s lone battleship&quot; steamed from San Francisco around Cape Horn to Key West to join the rest of Sampson&#x27;s fleet in early May, a journey completed in 66 days. The ship&#x27;s armament included four 13-inch guns, eight /30 caliber guns, and -thick steel armor. With its engines, it was propelled through the water at a rate upwards of 17 knots. Its combined speed and firepower gave &quot;Oregon&quot; the nickname &quot;bulldog of the Navy.&quot; These &quot;were clearly superior ships,&quot; observed W.J. Murphy, a sailor aboard &quot;Iowa.&quot; The powerful battleships, at least according to Murphy, enabled the US fleet to be victorious in battle.
Battleships and cruisers, however, were not the only forces the Americans employed in the conflict. Other vessels included torpedo boats like , light cruisers such as , and even the collier , which sank on June 3. Sampson specifically approached Lieutenant Richmond P. Hobson, the commanding officer, charging him with the task to &quot;sink the collier in the channel&quot; in order to both blockade the Spanish fleet and to clear the narrow passage of any mines.

===Standoff at Santiago===
Sampson structured the blockade as a semicircle at the opening of the harbor. An auxiliary ship floated around the edges and waited to be used if a forced entrance was necessary, and a torpedo boat was stationed farther off the front line. The newly-developed torpedo boat was charged with guarding Sampson&#x27;s flagship when he broke the blockade to perform &quot;frequent inspections, attacks, and pursuits,&quot; according to a correspondent aboard the &quot;New York&quot;.

Except for the sinking of &quot;Merrimac&quot;, the duty proved tedious. &quot;Blockade duty off the Cuban coast was long, dull and unremitting,&quot; wrote the historian Jim Leeke. During the day, the blockade stationed constant lookouts. At night, a battleship shone a searchlight on the entrance of the harbor if the Spanish fleet attempted an escape under the cover of darkness. The chore was repeated daily for nearly two months. As a sailor aboard put it, &quot;what at first had been a pleasure had become a duty.&quot;

As long as Cervera remained within Santiago Harbor, his fleet was relatively safe. The guns of the city were quite sufficient to make up for his fleet&#x27;s deficiencies, and the area was well defended with sea mines, torpedoes, and other obstructions. Nevertheless, Cervera was terribly outmatched. Though his ships were modern, they were too few, and their technical problems compounded his worries. The lack of refitting facilities in Santiago to assist with the repairs of the vessels in Cervera&#x27;s squadron made the situation all the more desperate.

For more than a month, the two fleets faced off, with only a few inconclusive skirmishes resulting. For his part, Cervera was content to wait in the hope that bad weather would scatter the Americans so that he could make a run to a position more favorable for engaging the enemy. However, US land forces began to drive on Santiago de Cuba, and by the end of June 1898, Cervera found himself unable to remain safely in the harbor, and Governor-General Ramón Blanco y Erenas wanted a sortie: &quot;it is better for the honor of our arms that the squadron perish in battle...&quot;

The breakout was planned for 09:00 on July 3. That seemed the most logical time: the Americans would be at religious services, and waiting until night would only make the escape even more treacherous. By noon on July 2, the fleet had a full head of steam and had fallen into position for the breakout.

At about 8:45 a.m., just as his ships had slipped their moorings, Admiral Sampson and two ships of his command, his flagship, the armored cruiser &quot;New York&quot;, and the torpedo boat had left their positions for a trip to Siboney and a meeting with Major General William Rufus Shafter of the US Army. That opened a gap in the western portion of the American blockade line, which left a window for Cervera. Sampson&#x27;s &quot;New York&quot; was one of only two ships in the squadron fast enough to catch Cervera if he managed to break through the blockade. Further, the battleship &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and the cruisers and &quot;New Orleans&quot; had left that morning to coal at Guantanamo Bay.

With the departure of Admiral Sampson, who had signaled, &quot;Disregard movements of flagship,&quot; immediate command devolved to Commodore Schley in armored cruiser &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, which now became the &quot;de facto&quot; flagship of the blockade.

Thus, the blockade formation that morning consisted of Schley&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, followed by the battleships &quot;Texas&quot;, &quot;Oregon&quot;, &quot;Iowa&quot;, and &quot;Indiana&quot; and the armed yachts and &quot;Gloucester&quot;.

At 09:35, the navigator of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sighted a plume of smoke coming from the mouth of the port and reported to Schley,

&quot;The enemy&#x27;s ships are coming out!&quot;

==Battle==


The Spanish column made its way around Cay Smith at around 9:31 a.m. on July 3 and left the channel about five minutes later. In the lead was Cervera&#x27;s flagship &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot;, followed by &quot;Vizcaya&quot;, &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot;, travelling at around and apart, followed by the torpedo-boat destroyers &quot;Plutón&quot; and &quot;Furor&quot;, respectively. They then formed three echelons, the destroyers heading eastward, followed by &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; and &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot;, and &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; and &quot;Vizcaya&quot; made for &quot;Brooklyn&quot;.

The battle commenced almost immediately. At the mouth of the harbor, the American vessels, &quot;Texas&quot;, &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Oregon&quot;, and &quot;Indiana&quot;, engulfed the Spanish fleet in a &quot;hail of fire.&quot; At 9:30 a.m., the first shot was fired by &quot;Iowa&quot; and Signal No. 250 was hoisted when the ships were seen in the channel. The Spanish responded, supported by the batteries on Morro and Upper Socapa. After leaving the channel, the Spanish vessels turned westward in column towards the American fleet.

While the Spanish had taken the initiative by beginning the engagement, two factors slowed their escape. One was the continuing problem experienced in maintaining proper speed by &quot;Vizcaya&quot;; the other was the poor quality of most of the coal in the Spanish holds. An expected resupply of high-quality anthracite had been captured aboard the collier &quot;Restormel&quot;, by the American auxiliary cruiser on May 25.

&quot;Brooklyn&quot; headed nearly straight for &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; at first, but by 10:05, it was apparent they were on a collision course, and Commodore Schley ordered a sharp turn to starboard, the so-called &quot;retrograde loop,&quot; when all of the other American ships had already turned to port. That threatened &quot;Texas&quot; with collision and Captain Philip of &quot;Texas&quot; ordered &quot;all engines back full,&quot; which brought &quot;Texas&quot; to a near standstill until &quot;Brooklyn&quot; passed across the bow of &quot;Texas&quot;. &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; and &quot;Vizcaya&quot; then altered course to the west, &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; and &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; falling in behind, and the two squadrons paralleled each other. &quot;Texas&quot; then swung behind &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, but &quot;Oregon&quot; then ran up on &quot;Texas&quot; and passed inboard, masking the fire of &quot;Texas&quot;. &quot;Oregon&quot;, initially to the rear of the action but the fastest ship in the US fleet, soon raced past &quot;Indiana&quot;, which had an engine problem and could go only at the time of the battle. &quot;Iowa&quot; had started from a disadvantaged position and was passed by &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; but hit her with two rounds from and swung into the chase. As &quot;Iowa&quot; was passed in turn by &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, the Spanish ship hit her with two shots from her secondary battery. One of them struck near the waterline and caused &quot;Iowa&quot; to slow and she therefore engaged &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot;, bringing up the rear of Cervera&#x27;s four cruisers. With the Spanish fleet past the American blockade, the battle became a chase.

Rather than expose the entirety of his fleet to the American battle line, Cervera had signaled his other ships to continue to the southwest while he attempted to cover their escape by directly engaging &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, his nearest enemy. Though &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was hit more than 20 times during the battle, she suffered only two casualties, and her return fire resulted in the deaths of most of Cervera&#x27;s bridge crew and grave damage to the ship generally. Under that brutal punishment, &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; began to burn furiously. According to Admiral Sampson&#x27;s battle report, &quot;it was afterward learned that the Infanta Maria Teresa&#x27;s fire-main had been cut by one of [the] first shots.&quot; Cervera ordered her aground at 10:35 in shallows along the Cuban coast and had been completely wrecked and aflame. Admiral Cervera survived and was rescued after he had been picked up near Punta Cabrera by the crew of &quot;Gloucester&quot;.

The rest of the Spanish fleet continued its race for the open sea. &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; was hit a total of 57 times and was driven out of the battle by the premature detonation of a shell stuck in a defective breech-block mechanism of an 11-inch turret, which killed the entire gun crew. A boiler explosion finished her, and she was ordered scuttled by the mortally wounded Captain Lazaga. At 10:35 &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; ran aground no more than a mile beyond &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Plutón&quot; and &quot;Furor&quot; made a dash in a direction opposite the rest of the Spanish squadron. &quot;Gloucester&quot; inflicted a considerable amount of damage by direct fire at close range to the destroyers, which eventually led to their destruction from the battleships &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, and eventually &quot;New York&quot;. After receiving word of the battle, Sampson turned his flagship &quot;New York&quot; around and raced to join the fight. &quot;Furor&quot; was sunk at 10:50 before making the beach. &quot;Plutón&quot; succeeded in grounding herself at 10:45 near Cabanas Bay. In total, &quot;Furor&quot; and &quot;Plutón&quot; lost two thirds of their men.

&quot;Vizcaya&quot; was locked in a running gun duel for nearly an hour with &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. Despite steaming side by side with Schley&#x27;s flagship at a range of about and even with some good shooting, which knocked out a secondary gun aboard &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, almost none of the Spaniards&#x27; nearly 300 shots caused significant damage, and &quot;Brooklyn&quot; pounded &quot;Vizcaya&quot; with devastating fire. Subsequent claims by Admiral Cervera and later research by historians have suggested that nearly 85% of the Spanish ammunition at Santiago was utterly useless, defective, or simply filled with sawdust as a cost-saving measure for practice firing. The American ammunition had no such issues of lethality. &quot;Vizcaya&quot; continued the fight until she was overwhelmed and by the end of the engagement, she had been struck as many as 200 times by the fire from &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot;. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had closed to within when she finally delivered an round, which, according to witnesses, may have detonated a torpedo being prepared for launch. A huge explosion ensued, &quot;Vizcaya&quot; was mortally wounded, and fires raged out of control that burned her reserves of ammunition that were on deck. She hauled down her flag and turned toward the Aserraderos beach to ground herself at 11:15.

Schley signaled &quot;Indiana&quot; to go back to the harbor entrance, and &quot;Iowa&quot; was signaled to resume blockading station. &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Ericsson,&quot; and aided the crew of the burning &quot;Vizcaya&quot;. Meanwhile, and &quot;Gloucester&quot; rescued those of &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; and &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot;. With flames and ready-to-explode ammunition on deck, the officers and sailors still ran into harm&#x27;s way to rescue the Spanish crews. These proved to be some of the most valiant actions performed that day.

While &quot;Vizcaya&quot; was under fire, &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; had drawn ahead. Within a little more than an hour, five of the six ships of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron had been destroyed or forced aground. Only one vessel, the speedy new armored cruiser &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, still survived and steamed as fast as she could for the west and freedom. Though modern in every respect and possibly the fastest ship in either fleet, &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; had one serious problem: she had been only recently purchased from Italy, and her main armament had not yet been installed because of a contractual issue with Armstrong Whitworth. She therefore sailed with empty main turrets but retained her ten secondary battery. That day, speed was her primary defense.

By the time &quot;Vizcaya&quot; had been beached, &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; was nearly six miles beyond &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Oregon&quot;. At her best rate of nearly , &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; slowly distanced herself from the pursuing US fleet. Her closest antagonist, USS &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, had begun the battle with just two of her four engines coupled because of her long stay on the blockade line, and she could manage barely while she was building steam. As &quot;Brooklyn&quot; ineffectively fired 8-inch rounds at the rapidly-disappearing &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, there was only one ship in the US fleet with a chance of maintaining the pursuit, &quot;Oregon&quot;, burning Cardiff coal and &quot;New York&quot;, doing .


For 65 min, &quot;Oregon&quot; pursued &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;. which hugged the coast and was unable to turn toward the open sea because &quot;Oregon&quot; was standing out about from the course of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; and would have been able to close the gap fatally of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; had turned to a more southerly course.

Finally, three factors converged to end the chase. &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; had run through her supply of high-quality Cardiff coal and was forced to begin using an inferior grade obtained from Spanish reserves in Cuba. Also, a peninsula jutting out from the coastline would soon force her to turn south, across &quot;Oregon&quot;″s path. Finally, on the flagship &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, Commodore Schley signaled &quot;Oregon&quot; Captain Charles Edgar Clark to open fire. Despite the immense range still separating &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, the forward turret of &quot;Oregon&quot; launched a pair of 13-inch shells that bracketed the wake of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; just astern of the ship.
&quot;Vizcaya&quot; exploded at 1:20 p.m., Captain Jose de Paredes, declining to see his crew needlessly killed, abruptly turned the &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; toward the mouth of the Turquino River and ordered the scuttle valves opened and the colors struck as she grounded. Captain Cook of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; went on board to receive the surrender. &quot;Oregon&quot; was in charge of the wreck of &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; with orders to save her if possible. All of the prisoners were to be transferred to . Despite all efforts, &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; was taken by the sea and sank in shoal water. As the ships of the US fleet pushed through the carnage and rescued as many Spanish survivors as possible, one officer was fished out by sailors of &quot;Iowa&quot;. The man proved to be Captain Don Antonio Eulate of &quot;Vizcaya&quot;. He thanked his rescuers and presented his sword to Captain Robley Evans, who handed it back as an act of chivalry.

By the end of the battle, the Spanish fleet had been completely destroyed. The Spanish lost more than 300 killed and 150 wounded out of 2,227 men, or approximately 22% of the fleet. 1,800 officers and men were taken prisoner by the Americans, and roughly 150 returned to Santiago de Cuba. The American fleet lost only one killed and one wounded, the former being Yeoman George Henry Ellis of the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. The Spanish ships were devastated by the overwhelming barrage of firepower by the Americans. However, according to historian David Trask, despite the overwhelming victory, only 1–3% of all rounds fired by the Americans found their mark.

==Sampson-Schley controversy==
The American victory bred controversy in the ranks of the naval officer corps over the question of the commanding officer who deserved credit for the victory. Should it be Sampson, who was in operational command of the fleet, but absent when Cervera&#x27;s force engaged the Americans, or Schley, who remained in tactical command during Sampson&#x27;s absence and who saw the fight to a successful close from the bridge of &quot;Brooklyn&quot;? The controversy between the two officers began almost immediately after the conclusion of the battle.

At the conclusion of the battle, Sampson&#x27;s flagship &quot;New York&quot; approached &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. Schley sent the message by signal flag: &quot;The enemy has surrendered&quot; and &quot;We have gained a great victory.&quot; Against common practice at the end of a victorious battle, Sampson did not respond with the expected congratulatory remark, but rather, according to historian Joseph G. Dawson, &quot;the answering signal was terse and seemed needlessly brusque.&quot; After the messages were exchanged, more tension grew between the two officers when Schley requested for he and his crew to &quot;have the honor of the surrender of the &quot;Cristobal Colon&quot;.&quot; With disregard to Schley and the other commanding officers, Sampson cabled Secretary Long, &quot;The fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present the whole of Cevera’s fleet.&quot; He invoked General William T. Sherman&#x27;s message to President Abraham Lincoln after taking Atlanta in 1864 but made no reference to Schley. A day after the news reached the United States, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article with the headline &quot;Sampson&#x27;s Fourth of July Victory,&quot; which expressed gratitude towards Sampson for his leadership during the battle. In Sampson&#x27;s hometown of Palmyra, New York, a respectful 100 shots were fired for his victory. Following the newspaper headlines were interviews and telegraphs from Sampson&#x27;s wife, sister, and two sons. Each message displayed praise and congratulations for his accomplishments in the battle.

Less than two weeks before Sampson&#x27;s battle report was due, reporters sensed that there was tension between the two officers. On July 5, Kentucky Representative Albert S. Berry went on record in favor of Schley by declaring, &quot;Schley is the real hero of the incident. Sampson commands the fleet in those waters, but it was Commodore Schley in command when Cervera and his fleet made the plucky attempt at escape and it was under Schley that every one of that Spanish fleet met its destruction.&quot; Berry still did not impugn Sampson but believed that Schley deserved much of the credit for the American victory. The next day, a news report from the &quot;Baltimore American&quot; declared that &quot;Schley [was] the real hero.&quot;

The controversy quickly became a public spectacle inflamed by journalistic sensationalism, popular interest in the recent war, and in the war&#x27;s celebration of military heroism. On August 9, 1898, the &quot;Springfield Republic&quot; claimed the controversy to be largely a product of writers determined &quot;to get a brilliant hero out of the Santiago battle at any cost.&quot; Many journalists felt that Sampson&#x27;s &quot;careful, thorough and comprehensive leadership&quot; did not fit the mold of the brash American hero in the era of Rooseveltian masculinity. Just as early motion picture-makers such as Thomas Edison made films celebrating Schley&#x27;s leadership at Santiago, journalists by and large placed Schley on a pedestal for winning the battle because he was the man standing on the bridge who led the fleet towards the enemy and victory in combat.

The controversy also sharply divided the Navy&#x27;s officer corps. Alfred Thayer Mahan, author of &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History: 1660–1783&quot;, threw his considerable influence behind Sampson. He argued that it did not matter who was in command during the battle because the &quot;stringent methods laid down&quot; by Sampson brought about the ultimate victory. In Mahan&#x27;s eyes, the press and the public were robbing Sampson of the credit that he deserved since it was through his overall command that Schley had the means to defeat the enemy.

Within the Navy, the controversy sharpened when Long proposed promotions for the two officers. Prior to the war, both men had held the rank of captain, and both men were promoted to rear admiral to reflect their wartime commands. After the war, Long proposed for both officers to be promoted to vice admiral. Sampson had ranked number ten in the Naval Register and Schley ranked number eight. Upon promotion, Sampson would be moved eight numbers up and Schley only six and would rank Sampson higher in the register than Schley. Alexander McClure, editor of the &quot;Philadelphia Times&quot;, warned President McKinley that the promotion of Sampson over Schley would be a &quot;great injustice&quot; in the eyes of the public. His warning was ignored, and the promotion of Sampson over Schley became permanent on March 3, 1899.

Shortly thereafter, &quot;The New York Sun&quot; published an article that quoted &quot;Brooklyn&quot;″s navigator, Lieutenant Commander Albon C. Hodgson, as saying that Schley gave orders to turn &quot;hard aport&quot; when first met by the Spanish fleet. That turn, in which &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had nearly collided with the battleship &quot;Texas&quot;, was a key critique of Schley&#x27;s antagonist that Sampson and his supporters had been using to construct an argument of cowardice against Schley. Hodgson asked if he meant to starboard, and Schley replied &quot;no.&quot; According to that testimony, Schley apparently said &quot;damn the &quot;Texas&quot;; let her look out for herself!&quot; Schley, denying any such remark, requested for Hodgson to write a formal statement retracting his accusations. He pointed out that such a statement would damage the reputation of not only Schley but also Hodgson. The latter complied and retracted his statement but requested Schley to write a statement explaining why he retracted his claim. Schley did not answer that request.

Long grew increasingly frustrated by the issue and its detrimental effects within the service. In November 1899, he ordered all officers to refrain from discussing the matter in public. However, debate continued in private, and those against Schley &quot;were determined to destroy his reputation through a court of inquiry&quot; that would investigate Schley&#x27;s actions and ultimately give credit to the appropriate officer. Schley had nothing to gain from a court of inquiry but was forced to seek a hearing on his own accord in order to clear his name. Outraged by the publication of Edgar S. Maclay&#x27;s &quot;History of the United States Navy&quot;, which Schley supporters deemed slanderous to the admiral&#x27;s reputation, Schley sought and received the court of inquiry.

A court of inquiry opened on September 12, 1901 at the Washington Navy Yard to investigate 24 charges against Schley from his search for Cervera off Cienfuegos to the conclusion of the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Contrary to public opinion, the court concluded after 40 days of deliberations closely followed by the public and the press that Schley did not &quot;project the right image of a naval officer&quot; because of his failure to act &quot;decisively between his departure from Key West to the time of the battle.&quot; In the court&#x27;s findings, Schley was criticized for his route to the battle and for possibly endangering the &quot;Texas&quot;. It also referenced the &quot;injustice to Lt. Cmdr. Hodgson when he published only a portion of the correspondence that passed between the officers about the matter.&quot; Admiral George Dewey, president of the court of inquiry and a so-called supporter of Schley, offered a dissenting opinion.

Disappointed with the court&#x27;s conclusions, Schley appealed his case to President Theodore Roosevelt. The president called for an end to all public disputes. Tensions died down temporarily, but arose after the publication of Long&#x27;s personal memoir in which the former secretary of the navy credited Sampson fully and believed that Schley contributed little to the battle&#x27;s outcome. Sampson died in 1902 and Schley in 1911, but the controversy left an internecine struggle within the Navy that in some ways tarnished its image after what had otherwise seemed a glorious naval victory.

==Aftermath==

The end of the Spanish–American War was in many ways a new beginning for the US Navy and marked a watershed moment in American and Spanish history. The defeat of the Spanish Navy gave the US nearly uncontested control of the seas surrounding Cuba. With resupply of the Spanish garrison nearly impossible, Spain ultimately sued for peace and surrendered in August, and the war was over. Some of the terms of surrender were as follows:

:&quot;3. Que los Estados Unidos convienen en transportar todas las fuerzas españolas en dicho territorio al Reino de España con la menor demora posible… [That the United States agrees to carry all Spanish forces in that territory to the Kingdom of Spain with the least possible delay...]&quot;

:&quot;5. Las autoridades españoles convienen en quitar, o ayudar a que sean quitadas por la Marina americana, todas las minas y demás entorpecimientos a la navegación que existen ahora en la bahía de Santiago de Cuba y su entrada. [The Spanish authorities agree to remove or help to remove with the American Navy, all mines or other obstructions to navigation that now exist in the Bay of Santiago de Cuba and its entrance.]&quot;

:&quot;9. Que las fuerzas españolas saldrán de Santiago de Cuba con honores de guerra, depositando después sus armas en un lugar mutuamente convenido... [That the Spanish forces will leave Santiago de Cuba with the honors of war, afterwards depositing their weapons in a mutually agreed-upon place...]&quot;

The terms, upon which both sides came to an agreement during the 1898 Treaty of Paris (1898) negotiations, decided the fate of the remaining Spanish troops, vessels, and the matter of Cuba&#x27;s sovereignty. Spanish prisoners-of-war who were not wounded were sent to Seavey&#x27;s Island at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, where they were confined at Camp Long from July to September 1898. The Americans treated Spain&#x27;s officers, soldiers, and sailors with great respect. Ultimately, Spanish prisoners were returned to Spain with their &quot;honors of war&quot; on American ships.

The battle was the end of any noteworthy Spanish naval presence in the New World. It forced Spain to reassess its strategy in Cuba and resulted in an ever-tightening blockade of the island. Fighting continued until August. When the Treaty of Paris was signed, all surviving Spanish capital ships were now husbanded to defend their homeland and left only isolated units of auxiliary vessels to defend the coast. Uncontested US control of the seas around Cuba made resupply of the Spanish garrison impossible and its surrender inevitable. Admiral Cervera received different treatment from the sailors taken to Portsmouth. For a time, he was held at Annapolis, Maryland, where he was received with great enthusiasm by the people of that city. The Battle of Santiago de Cuba brought Cervera peace of mind that he had fulfilled an officer&#x27;s duties and that his fleet had upheld Spanish honor. His bravery in the face of the enemy&#x27;s superiority garnered respect from Spanish and American sailors and officers alike. The Spanish prisoners-of-war were released upon the signing of the 1898 Treaty of Paris, and the remaining Spanish forces left Cuba. Civil order was left to the military government that the United States established. The US Army under the overall administration of General Leonard Wood governed the island for some time afterwards and, with help, removed many of the mines that had been laid in the bay.

In the imperial vacuum left by Spain&#x27;s New World empire, the United States now exerted considerable influence both in annexing formal territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines and in subsequent American military interventions throughout the Caribbean over the next half-century.

The late 19th century was a transitional period for the US Navy and for the growth of American power. The war and the conquest of territory seemed to validate American navalism and tipped the scale of US naval policy towards the full embrace of Mahanian sea power. The Spanish–American War and subsequent interventions in Latin America known collectively as the Banana Wars were indicative of American commitment to the Monroe Doctrine articulated by the Roosevelt Corollary, which committed the United States, through the Navy and Marine Corps particularly, to be an international police force in the Western Hemisphere.

Imperialist sentiments followed the victory of the US Navy and the newfound celebrity status of some of its commanders. Part of the impetus for new territorial expansion was the need for foreign naval bases and the need for a larger navy to take and maintain control of such bases. The Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico, and others had become locations for US overseas naval bases and coaling stations, but native resistance remained high. The resistance in the Philippines developed into a colonial war between local guerrillas and US forces under Major General Elwell S. Otis, who was appointed military governor of the Philippines after the Spanish–American War. The territorial conflict was ironic because the roles of the Spanish–American War were now reversed. The US had fought to free Cuba from Spain&#x27;s colonial power but now aimed to colonize the Philippines. Ultimately, the Spanish–American War brought to light deeply rooted conflicts between the principles of democracy and the urges of the buffing American imperialism.

Two of the Spanish ships, &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; and &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, were later re-floated and taken over by the US. Both eventually foundered and were lost. , abandoned in Santiago Bay because of engine troubles, was an unprotected cruiser captured by the US Navy and used as a receiving ship until 1957 as .

All of the various flags, warship pennants, national combat flags, the royal standard, admirals&#x27; flags, and so on retrieved from the Spanish ships in the days following the battle are part of the United States Navy Trophy Flag Collection at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. The collection was given to the care of the US Naval Academy by an act of Congress in 1949.

In 1998, in recognition of the hundredth anniversary of the battle and the Spanish–American War, the US Secretary of the Navy authorized the return of the National Combat Flag from the Spanish flagship &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; to the Spanish Navy via their Chief of Staff, who was to meet with the US Navy Chief of Naval Operations in Newport, Rhode Island. However, the return of the flag was aborted when the curator of the Naval Academy Museum, citing the congressional language from 1949, refused to surrender the banner.

<text>Scott McNealy (born November 13, 1954) is an American businessman. He is most famous for co-founding the computer technology company Sun Microsystems in 1982 along with Vinod Khosla, Bill Joy, and Andy Bechtolsheim. In 2004, while still at Sun, McNealy founded Curriki, a free online education service. In 2011, he co-founded Wayin, a social intelligence and visualization company based in Denver. McNealy stepped down from his position as CEO of Wayin in 2016.

==Career==
McNealy earned a Bachelor of Arts in economics from Harvard and an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. McNealy has self-deprecatingly referred to himself as a &quot;golf major&quot; rather than a computer scientist.

McNealy started out working at American Motors, where his father was vice chairman and vice president of marketing. He later became manufacturing director at Onyx Systems, a vendor of microprocessor-based Unix systems.

In 1982, he was approached by fellow Stanford alumnus Vinod Khosla to help provide the necessary organizational and business leadership for Sun Microsystems. Sun, along with companies such as Apple Inc., Silicon Graphics, 3Com, and Oracle Corporation, was part of a wave of successful startup companies in California&#x27;s Silicon Valley during the early and mid-1980s. The name &quot;Sun&quot; was derived from co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim&#x27;s original Stanford University Network (SUN) computer project, the SUN workstation.

In 1984, McNealy took over the CEO role from Khosla, who ultimately would leave the company in 1985. On April 24, 2006, McNealy stepped down as CEO after serving in that position for 22 years, and turned the job over to Jonathan I. Schwartz. McNealy is one of the few CEOs of a major corporation to have had a tenure of over twenty years.

According to the book &quot;The Decline and Fall of Nokia&quot;, Scott McNealy was the &quot;dream candidate&quot; to become CEO of Nokia in 2010. However, McNealy said he was not offered the job.

In 2017, Scott joined the golf app startup 18Birdies as advisor and equity partner.

In early 2018, he joined the Redis Labs advisory board.

===Wayin===
In 2010, the same year Oracle Corporation purchased Sun, McNealy co-founded the social media intelligence company Wayin. The new venture was not widely covered in the media; the day he invited reporters to his home to launch Wayin was the same day Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died. Their product is an application store for brands to self-publish interactive advertising campaigns using reusable digital assets, removing the bulk of cost involved in delivering multi-channel digital advertising.

Wayin sought out and merged with EngageSciences in 2016, to acquire senior staff and diversify their market. In May of that year, McNealy stepped down as CEO and EngageSciences head Richard Jones became CEO of the combined company.
In July 2019, Wayin was acquired by Cheetah Digital.

==Personal life==
McNealy was born to Marmalee Doris (née Noffke) and
Raymond William McNealy Jr. (1927–2014), in Columbus, Indiana. He grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where his father, was vice chairman of the American Motors Corporation. He graduated from Cranbrook School; he later supported the campaign of fellow Cranbrook alumnus and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Most of his work experience prior to joining Sun was in automotive manufacturing.

He is married to Susan Ingemanson. They lived in
Portola Valley, CA, now in Nevada, and have four sons: Maverick, Dakota, Colt, and Scout. He is known to be an enthusiastic ice hockey player and has been ranked as one of the best golfers in executive ranks.

He is the commissioner of the Alternative Golf Association (known as &quot;Flogton&quot;).

==Positions at Sun==
* Chairman of the board of directors from April 2006 to January 2010
* Chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer from April 2004 to April 2006
* Chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer from July 2002 to April 2004
* Chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer from April 1999 to June 2002
* Chairman of the board of directors, president and chief executive officer from December 1984 to April 1999
* President and chief operating officer from February 1984 to December 1984
* Vice president of operations from February 1982 to February 1984

==Awards==
In 1987, McNealy was named an Award Recipient of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Northern California Region.

==Opinions==
While at Sun, McNealy used the phrase “disagree and commit” (which later became a management principle adopted by other large cooperations) as early as some time between 1983 and 1991, as part of the line &quot;Agree and commit, disagree and commit, or get out of the way&quot;.

In 1999, McNealy said, &quot;You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.&quot; Writer Stephen Manes criticized the statement in his &quot;Full Disclosure&quot; column: &quot;He&#x27;s right on the facts, wrong on the attitude... Instead of &#x27;getting over it&#x27;, citizens need to demand clear rules on privacy, security, and confidentiality.&quot; The authors of &quot;Privacy in the 21st Century&quot; admitted, &quot;While a shocking statement, there is an element of truth in it.&quot;

McNealy was an early advocate of the networked environment; his company&#x27;s motto was The Network is the Computer. At times, he has been known to be skeptical of products that do not integrate well with networked environments. One example McNealy has given involved the Apple iPod. As quoted in &quot;The Register&quot;, McNealy said, &quot;There’s a pendulum thing where stuff is on the client side and then goes back into the network where it belongs. The answering machine put voicemail by the desk, and then it went back into the network. Your iPod is like your home answering machine. I guarantee you it will be hard to sell an iPod five or seven years from now when every cell phone can access your entire music library wherever you are.&quot;

McNealy is a self-proclaimed &quot;raging libertarian&quot;, although he often supports and endorses the Republican Party. He makes regular appearances on the Fox Business Channel to discuss libertarian business issues. In 2017, McNealy praised the 45th U.S. President, Donald Trump, for his free-market economic policies. On September 17, 2019, McNealy hosted a fundraiser for Donald Trump&#x27;s re-election campaign.

<text>Richard Joseph Neutra ( ; 8 April 1892 – 16 April 1970) was an Austrian-American architect. Living and building for most of his career in Southern California, he came to be considered a prominent and important modernist architect. His most notable works include the Kaufmann Desert House, in Palm Springs, California.

==Biography==
Neutra was born in Leopoldstadt, the second district of Vienna, Austria Hungary, on 8 April 1892, into a wealthy Jewish family. His Jewish-Hungarian father Samuel Neutra (1844–1920), was a proprietor of a metal foundry, and his mother, Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Glaser Neutra (1851–1905) was a member of the IKG Wien. Richard had two brothers, who also emigrated to the United States, and a sister, Josephine Theresia &quot;Pepi&quot; Weixlgärtner, an artist who married the Austrian art historian Arpad Weixlgärtner and who later emigrated to Sweden. Her work can be seen at the Modern Art Museum in Stockholm.

Neutra attended the Sophiengymnasium in Vienna until 1910. He studied under Max Fabiani and Karl Mayreder at the Vienna University of Technology (1910–18) and also attended the private architecture school of Adolf Loos. In 1912, he undertook a study trip to Italy and the Balkans with Ernst Ludwig Freud (son of Sigmund Freud).

In June 1914, Neutra&#x27;s studies were interrupted when he was ordered to Trebinje, where he served as a lieutenant in the artillery until the end of World War I. Dione Neutra recalled her husband Richard&#x27;s hatred of the retribution against the Serbs in an interview conducted in 1978 after his death: &quot;He talked about the people he met [i.e. in Trebinje] … how his commander was a sadist, who was able to play out his sadistic tendencies…. He was just a small town clerk in Vienna, but then he became his commander.&quot;

Neutra took a leave in 1917 to return to the Technische Hochschule to take his final examinations.

After World War I, Neutra moved to Switzerland, where he worked with the landscape architect Gustav Ammann. In 1921, he served briefly as city architect in the German town of Luckenwalde, and later in the same year he joined the office of Erich Mendelsohn in Berlin. Neutra contributed to the firm&#x27;s competition entry for a new commercial center for Haifa, Palestine (1922), and to the Zehlendorf housing project in Berlin (1923). He married Dione Niedermann, the daughter of an architect, in 1922. They had three sons, Frank L (1924–2008), Dion (1926–2019), who became an architect and his father&#x27;s partner, and Raymond Richard Neutra (1939–), a physician and environmental epidemiologist.

Richard Neutra moved to the United States by 1923 and became a naturalized citizen in 1929. He worked briefly for Frank Lloyd Wright before accepting an invitation from Rudolf Schindler, a close friend from his university days, to work and live communally in Schindler&#x27;s Kings Road House in California. Neutra&#x27;s first works in California were both in the realm of landscape architecture: namely, the grounds of the Lovell Beach House (1922–25), in Newport Beach, which Schindler had designed for Philip Lovell; and a pergola and wading pool for the complex that Wright and Schindler had designed for Aline Barnsdall on Olive Hill (1925), in Hollywood. Schindler and Neutra would go on to collaborate on an entry for the League of Nations Competition (1926–27); in the same year, they formed a firm with the planner Carol Aronovici (1881–1957), called the Architectural Group for Industry and Commerce (AGIC). Neutra subsequently developed his own practice and went on to design numerous buildings embodying the International Style, 12 of which are designated as Historic Cultural Monuments (HCM), including the Lovell Health House (HCM #123; 1929), for the same client as the Lovell Beach House, and the Richard and Dion Neutra VDL Research House (HCM #640; 1966). In California, he became celebrated for rigorously geometric but airy structures that epitomized a West Coast version of mid-century modern residential design. His clients included Edgar J. Kaufmann, (who had commissioned Wright to design Fallingwater, in Pennsylvania), Galka Scheyer, and Walter Conrad Arensberg. In the early 1930s, Neutra&#x27;s Los Angeles practice trained several young architects who went on to independent success, including Gregory Ain, Harwell Hamilton Harris, and Raphael Soriano. In 1932, he tried to move to the Soviet Union, to help design workers&#x27; housing that could be easily constructed, as a means of helping with the housing shortage.

In 1932, Neutra was included in the seminal MoMA exhibition on modern architecture, curated by Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock. From 1943 to 1944, Neutra served as a visiting professor of design at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont. In 1949 Neutra formed a partnership with Robert E. Alexander that lasted until 1958, which finally gave him the opportunity to design larger commercial and institutional buildings. In 1955, the United States Department of State commissioned Neutra to design a new embassy in Karachi. Neutra&#x27;s appointment was part of an ambitious program of architectural commissions to renowned architects, which included embassies by Walter Gropius in Athens, Edward Durrell Stone in New Delhi, Marcel Breuer in The Hague, Josep Lluis Sert in Baghdad, and Eero Saarinen in London. In 1965, Neutra formed a partnership with his son Dion Neutra. Between 1960 and 1970, Neutra created eight villas in Europe, four in Switzerland, three in Germany, and one in France. Prominent clients in this period included Gerd Bucerius, publisher of &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, as well as figures from commerce and science. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Richard Joseph Neutra died on 16 April 1970, at the age of 78.

==Architectural style==
He was known for the attention he gave to defining the real needs of his clients, regardless of the size of the project, in contrast to other architects eager to impose their artistic vision on a client. Neutra sometimes used detailed questionnaires to discover his client&#x27;s needs, much to their surprise. His domestic architecture was a blend of art, landscape, and practical comfort.

In a 1947 article for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Changing House,&quot; Neutra emphasizes the &quot;ready-for-anything&quot; plan – stressing an open, multifunctional plan for living spaces that are flexible, adaptable and easily modified for any type of life or event.

Neutra had a sharp sense of irony. In his autobiography, &quot;Life and Shape&quot;, he included a playful anecdote about an anonymous movie producer-client who electrified the moat around the house that Neutra designed for him and had his Persian butler fish out the bodies in the morning and dispose of them in a specially designed incinerator. This was a much-embellished account of an actual client, Josef von Sternberg, who indeed had a moated house but not an electrified one.

The novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand was the second owner of the Von Sternberg House in the San Fernando Valley (now destroyed). A photo of Neutra and Rand at the home was taken by Julius Shulman.

Neutra&#x27;s early watercolors and drawings, most of them of places he traveled (particularly his trips to the Balkans in WWI) and portrait sketches, showed influence from artists such as Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele etc. Neutra&#x27;s sister Josefine, who could draw, is cited as developing Neutra&#x27;s inclination towards drawing. 

== Legacy ==
Neutra&#x27;s son Dion has kept the Silver Lake offices designed and built by his father open as &quot;Richard and Dion Neutra Architecture&quot; in Los Angeles. The Neutra Office Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1980, Neutra&#x27;s widow donated the Van der Leeuw House (VDL Research House), then valued at $207,500, to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) to be used by the university&#x27;s College of Environmental Design faculty and students. In 2011, the Neutra-designed Kronish House (1954) at 9439 Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills sold for $12.8 million.

In 2009, the exhibition &quot;Richard Neutra, Architect: Sketches and Drawings&quot; at the Los Angeles Central Library featured a selection of Neutra&#x27;s travel sketches, figure drawings and building renderings. An exhibition on the architect&#x27;s work in Europe between 1960 and 1979 was mounted by the MARTa Herford, Germany.

The Kaufmann Desert House was restored by Marmol Radziner + Associates in the mid-1990s.

The typeface family Neutraface, designed by Christian Schwartz for House Industries, was based on Richard Neutra&#x27;s architecture and design principles.

In 1977, he was posthumously awarded the AIA Gold Medal, and in 2015, he was honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, California.

<doc id="254838" wikidata="Q380473" url="?curid=254838" title="Coherent (operating system)">
<text>Coherent is a clone of the Unix operating system for IBM PC compatibles and other microcomputers, developed and sold by the now-defunct Mark Williams Company (MWC). Historically, the operating system was a proprietary product, but it became open source in 2015, released under the BSD-3-Clause license.

==Development==
Coherent was not Unix; the Mark Williams Company had no rights to either the Unix trademark or the AT&amp;T/Bell Labs source code. In the early years of its existence, MWC received a visit from an AT&amp;T delegation looking to determine whether MWC was infringing on AT&amp;T Unix property. The delegation included Dennis Ritchie, who concluded that &quot;it was very hard to believe that Coherent and its basic applications were not created without considerable study of the OS code and details of its applications.&quot; However, he also stated that:

Much of the operating system was written by alumni from the University of Waterloo: Tom Duff, Dave Conroy, Randall Howard, Johann George, and Trevor John Thompson. Significant contributions were also made by people such as Nigel Bree (from Auckland, New Zealand), the later author of Ghost.

==Versions==
Coherent was originally written for the PDP-11 range of minicomputers in 1980, then ported to various early 1980s microcomputer systems including IBM PC compatibles and machines based on the Zilog Z8000 and Motorola 68000. Initially sold to OEMs, starting 1983 it was available on the consumer market from MWC directly. At this point, Coherent 2.3 offered roughly the functionality of Version 7 Unix on PC hardware, including the nroff formatter but not the BSD extensions offered by competing Unix/clone vendors; compared to its competitors, it was a small system distributed on only seven double-sided floppy disks, costing only US$500 for a license.

&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1984 called Coherent a &quot;highly compatible UNIX Version 7 lookalike&quot;. In 1985 it criticized the difficulty of installation, but stated that &quot;as a UNIX clone, Coherent is amazingly complete ... it should be easy to port programs ... the price of $495 is a bargain&quot;. Early 1990s reviews of Coherent pointed out that the system was much smaller than other contemporary Unix offerings, as well as less expensive at US$99.95, but lacking in functionality and software support. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; called Coherent 3.0 a &quot;time capsule&quot; that captured the state of Unix in the late 1970s, without support for mice, LANs or SCSI disks, good for learning basic Unix programming but not for business automation. A review in the AUUG&#x27;s newsletter was more positive, favorably comparing Coherent to MKS Toolkit, Minix and Xenix, and suggesting it might fill a niche as a low-end training platform.

Coherent was able to run on most Intel-based PCs with Intel 8088, 286, 386, and 486 processors. Coherent version 3 for Intel-based PCs required at least a 286, Coherent version 4 for Intel-based PCs required at least a 386. Like a true Unix, Coherent was able to multitask and support multiple users. From version 4, released 1992, Coherent also had support for X11 and MGR windowing systems.

Later versions of Coherent (version 4 and higher) supported features common in modern Unix-like systems, including a version of MicroEMACS, access to FAT16 file systems, an optimizing C compiler, and a modified version of Taylor UUCP. The final releases of Coherent also fully supported the iBCS COFF binary standard, which allowed binary compatibility with SCO Unix applications, including WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, and several Microsoft applications including QuickBASIC, Microsoft Word, and MultiPlan. The last 386 versions supported virtual memory, but not demand paging.

A Zilog Z8000 port of Coherent was also used by the canceled Commodore 900 system.

In 1983, NCSC (a subsidiary of Nixdorf) announced a port of Coherent to IBM mainframes, in the form of a Unix compatibility subsystem for IBM&#x27;s DOS/VS and DOS/VSE and Nixdorf&#x27;s Edos/VS and Edos/VSE operating systems, known as Programmer Work Station/VSE-Advanced Functions, or PWS/VSE-AF for short.

The Mark Williams Company closed in 1995.

On January 3, 2015, Coherent sources were released under the BSD-3-Clause license.

<doc id="254844" wikidata="Q801694" url="?curid=254844" title="Ōsaka Station">
<text>is a major railway station in the Umeda district of Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It forms as one of the city&#x27;s main railway terminals to the north, the other being Shin-Ōsaka.

Although it is officially served by only the JR Kobe/Kyoto Lines (Tōkaidō Main Line) and the Osaka Loop Line, Ōsaka is the starting point of JR Takarazuka Line service, and serves as the terminal for trains bound for the San&#x27;in region via JR Takarazuka Line and the Hokuriku region via JR Kyoto Line, while offering connections to trains bound for Nara, Wakayama and Kansai International Airport via the Osaka Loop Line.

Umeda Station (Hankyu, Hanshin, and Osaka Metro Midosuji Line), Nishi-Umeda Station (Subway Yotsubashi Line) and Higashi-Umeda Station (Subway Tanimachi Line) are directly connected to Ōsaka Station, and Kitashinchi Station on the JR Tozai Line is within walking distance.

Ōsaka Station and Umeda Station, effectively part of the same complex, together constitute the busiest station in Western Japan, serving 2,343,727 passengers daily in 2005, and the fourth-busiest railway station in the world.

Ōsaka Station also houses a large terminal for overnight bus services to other cities in Japan, and until March 2013 also had a nearby freight terminal complex, Umeda Freight Terminal, owned by JR Freight.

==Station layout==



Ōsaka station is elevated above street level, on the second floor of the station complex. There are four concourses, corresponding to four sets of ticket gates: the Midosuji gates, serving as a transfer point to Hankyu and Subway Umeda Station and Higashi-Umeda Station; the Central gates, with access to Daimaru, Lucua, Yodobashi Camera, Umeda Sky Building, Grand Front and transfers to Hanshin Umeda and JR Kitashinchi Station; the Sakurabashi gates, with access to Ōsaka Garden City and transfers to Subway Nishi-Umeda Station, city bus, hotel shuttle buses and taxi; and the Bridge Gates, with direct access into Daimaru and Lucua, as well as a bridge passage to Hankyu Umeda. The Midosuji concourse is on the lower level, with escalators and elevators leading directly to platforms; the Central concourse has both direct escalators and a mezzanine-level transfer passage connected by stairs; the Sakurabashi concourse has gates on ground level but is primarily on the mezzanine level, connected to the central concourse by a corridor; and the Bridge Gate is on the third level above the platforms, and connected by escalators and elevators. An additional concourse is planned for the west side of the station, which will link the elevated platforms with the under-construction underground platforms to the northwest of the main station.

Platforms and tracks are on the second floor. There were previously six island platforms and one side platform serving 13 tracks; the highest-numbered track was Track 11, as the Osaka Loop Line tracks were referred to as &quot;Inner Loop&quot; and &quot;Outer Loop&quot; only. In preparation for the construction of the new north building, the sixth platform was closed and the seventh was removed altogether; at the same time, the remaining platforms were renumbered so that Tracks 1 and 2 were for the Ōsaka Loop Line, and so on. The sixth platform reopened on 20 December 2009 and there became five island platforms and a side platform serving 11 tracks in total (up to the new Track 11—the old Track 9). The remainder of the old Track 11 platform, on the west side of the station, was used as a pedestrian walkway linking the North Gate Building with its parking garage until 2020, when it was removed to facilitate construction of a new West Gate Building. There was originally a through track in between tracks 8 and 9, but it had been long disused; during the closure of Track 11, the platform for Tracks 9 and 10 was expanded and this track was used temporarily as Track 9. Since 12 October 2010, this track has been used permanently as Track 8 after the widening of the adjoining platform.

An additional four tracks are located under the northwest side of the station complex, via relocated underground JR Freight tracks (Umeda branch line) originally used for Umeda Freight Station. Opened for passenger service on 18 March 2023, these tracks serve as the western terminus of the Osaka Higashi Line, with single track connection for continuing Umeda branch freight service as well as &quot;Haruka&quot; and &quot;Kuroshio&quot; limited express services. There is also a stub tunnel west of the platforms, for planned connection to the Naniwasuji Line.

==History==
Osaka Station opened on 11 May 1874, as one of the first railway stations in the Kansai region when the railway between Osaka and Kobe started operation. It was electrified along with the Tōkaidō Main Line in 1934.

The existence of the station naturally made the area the primary transport hub of the city. Railways that set Ōsaka Station as the terminal or built their terminal around Osaka Station include Osaka Railway (present-day east half of the Osaka Loop Line) in 1895, Nishinari Railway (west half of the Osaka Loop Line) in 1898, Hanshin Electric Railway in 1906, Minoo Arima Electric Tramway (Hankyu Railway) in 1910, and Osaka Municipal Subway in 1933. The regional railways tended to name their stations Umeda, the name of the area, rather than the city name.

The air raids in World War II flattened the blocks in front of the station. Immediately after the war, the area turned into a huge black market, the atmosphere of which remained until redevelopment in the 1970s.

The station building was rebuilt in 1901, 1940, and 1979 (north building). In 1983, a high-rise building, Acty Osaka, which housed a department store and a hotel, was added to the south of the station.

A new north station building (the North Gate Building) was opened in 2011, coinciding with an expansion of Acty Osaka (now the South Gate Building) and major renovation of the station areas with a new concourse and north–south connection. This is the first step in a larger drive to redevelop the land used by JR Freight&#x27;s Umeda Terminal, which is seen as the last undeveloped piece of real estate in the area. Plans also call for moving the Umeda Freight Line underground and establishing a terminal for the Osaka Higashi Line just north of ALBi, with an eye towards a future extension to JR Namba Station (thus alleviating delays on the Osaka Loop Line caused by Limited Express trains). The relocation of the former Umeda Freight line (and related redevelopments) ultimately became part of the Naniwasuji Line project in 2019.

Station numbering was introduced in March 2018 with the Tokaido Line platforms being assigned station number JR-A47, the Fukuchiyama Line platforms being assigned station number JR-G48, and the Osaka Loop Line platforms being assigned station number JR-O11.

The new underground facilities at Osaka Station (nicknamed &quot;Ume-kita&quot; during planning and construction) opened for service from the start of the revised timetable on 18 March 2023. In preparation for the opening, all limited express trains running on the Umeda Freight Line were re-routed through the new underground tracks in February 2023.

===Major renovation===
=== Future expansion ===
A new line called the Naniwasuji Line is planned to be opened by 2031 and will route trains under the Naniwasuji corridor to JR Namba Station and further south. To prepare for the opening of the line, an additional two underground platforms serving four tracks opened for service on the northwest side of the station on 18 March 2023. The next phase of the Naniwasuji Line is to construct the underground tracks south to JR Namba Station and the Nankai Main Line.

<text>Primo Carnera (; 26 October 1906 – 29 June 1967), nicknamed the Ambling Alp, was an Italian professional boxer and wrestler who reigned as the boxing World Heavyweight Champion from 29 June 1933 to 14 June 1934. He won more fights by knockout than any other heavyweight champion (IBU, NBA, NYSAC) in boxing history.

==Personal life==

Primo Carnera was born in Sequals, then in the Province of Udine, now in the Province of Pordenone, Friuli-Venezia Giulia at the north-easternmost corner of Italy.

On 13 March 1939, Carnera married Giuseppina Kovačič (1913–1980), a post office clerk from Gorizia. In 1953, they received dual citizenship. They settled in Los Angeles, where Carnera opened a restaurant and a liquor store. They had two children, Umberto and Giovanna Maria. Umberto became a medical doctor. Carnera died in 1967 at age 60 in his native town of a combination of liver disease and complications from diabetes.

==Professional boxing career==
===Overview===
Carnera was touted in America as being tall, and thus the tallest heavyweight in history (up until that time), but he was actually tall. He fought at as much as . Jess Willard who stood was the tallest world heavyweight champion in boxing history until Nikolai Valuev, at and . Though shorter than Willard, Carnera was around heavier and was the heaviest champion in boxing history until Valuev.

At a time when the average height in Italy was approximately and in the United States , Carnera was considered a giant.

He enjoyed a sizable reach advantage over most rivals, and when seen on fight footage, he seems like a towering giant compared to many heavyweights of his era, who were usually at least lighter and shorter. One publicity release about him read in part: &quot;For breakfast, Primo has a quart of orange juice, two quarts of milk, nineteen pieces of toast, fourteen eggs, a loaf of bread and half a pound of Virginia ham.&quot; His size earned him the nickname &quot;The Ambling Alp&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him &quot;The Monster&quot;.
===Starting career===
12 September 1928 was the date of Carnera&#x27;s first professional fight, against Leon Sebilo, in Paris. Carnera won by knockout in round two. He won his first six bouts, then lost to Franz Diener by disqualification in round one at Leipzig. Then, he won seven more bouts in a row before meeting Young Stribling. He and Stribling exchanged disqualification wins, Carnera winning the first in four rounds, and Stribling winning the rematch in round seven. In Carnera&#x27;s next bout he avenged his defeat to Diener with a knockout in round six.

In 1930, he moved to the United States, where he toured extensively, winning his first seventeen bouts there by knockout. George Godfrey broke the knockout streak in Philadelphia by losing to Carnera by disqualification in the fifth round. In 1932, Carnera faced the tallest heavyweight in history up to that point, Santa Camarão, a Portuguese fighter. Carnera won the fight in a sixth-round knockout.
On 10 February 1933, he knocked out Ernie Schaaf in thirteen rounds in New York City. Schaaf died four days later. Schaaf had suffered a severe beating and knockout in a bout with future heavyweight champion Max Baer six months earlier, on 31 August 1932. Furthermore, an autopsy revealed that Schaaf had meningitis, a swelling of the brain, and was still recovering from a severe case of influenza when he entered the ring with Carnera.

=== World Heavyweight Champion ===
For his next fight, Carnera faced the world heavyweight champion, Jack Sharkey, on June 29, at the Madison Square Garden Bowl in Queens, New York. Carnera became world champion by knocking out Sharkey in round six. He retained the title against Paulino Uzcudun and Tommy Loughran, both by decision in 15 rounds.

In his next fight on 14 June 1934 against Max Baer, Carnera was knocked down multiple times in 11 rounds before referee Arthur Donovon stopped the fight. There is disagreement regarding how many times Carnera was knocked down, with sources giving conflicting totals of 7, 10, 11 (per Associated Press) and 12 (per &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine founder Nat Fleischer, ringside for the fight, who wrote that Carnera was knocked down 12 times and slipped once after a missed punch). Carnera also fractured his right ankle in the defeat.

A statue of the defeated Carnera won the Prix de Rome First Prize in 1934. L&#x27;Athlète vaincu by Albert Bouquillon.

=== After defeat ===
After that, Carnera won his next four fights, three of them as part of a South American tour that took him to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, as well as two exhibitions fought on the South American continent. But then, on 25 June 1935, he was knocked out in six rounds by Joe Louis.

For the next two and a half years, he won five and lost three of eight total fights. In 1938 Carnera, a diabetic, had to have a kidney removed, which forced him into retirement by 1944. Carnera&#x27;s record was 89 wins and 14 losses. His 72 wins by knockout made him a member of the exclusive club of boxers that won 50 or more bouts by knockout.

==Legacy in boxing==
Carnera was the third European to hold the world heavyweight championship after Bob Fitzsimmons and Max Schmeling. He would be the last until Ingemar Johansson claimed the title against Floyd Patterson in 1959, over a quarter of a century later.

Carnera was also the first boxer to win the European Heavyweight title and subsequently become World Heavyweight champion.

Carnera&#x27;s 1933 title defense against Tommy Loughran held the record for the greatest weight differential between two combatants in a world title fight () for 73 years until the reign of Nikolai Valuev, who owns the current record for the weight advantage he held in his 2006 defense against Monte Barrett.

Valuev also broke Carnera&#x27;s record of to become the heaviest world champion in history, weighing as high as during his reign. Carnera still ranks as the fourth-heaviest, behind Valuev, Tyson Fury and Andy Ruiz Jr., over eighty years after he held the title.

Carnera&#x27;s 1933 title defense against Paulino Uzcudun in Italy was the first Heavyweight title fight to be held in Europe since Jack Johnson&#x27;s title defence against Frank Moran in Paris in 1913. It would be the last such occasion until Muhammad Ali defended the title against Henry Cooper in London in 1966. Carnera-Uzcudun was the first World Heavyweight championship fight to be contested between two Europeans. It would be another sixty years, when Lennox Lewis defended the WBC heavyweight title against fellow-Englishman Frank Bruno in 1993, that this would occur again.

Carnera&#x27;s 72 career knockouts is the most of any world heavyweight champion (IBU, NBA, NYSAC).

His long term manager, Leon See noted how Carnera could not absorb a hard punch on the chin, pre-arranging with opponents (and sparring partners) not to hit him on the chin. His management team took the vast majority of Carnera’s earnings leaving him with practically nothing.

==Acting career==

Carnera appeared in a short film in 1931. During his tenure as world champion he played a fictional version of himself in the 1933 film &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot; starring Max Baer and Myrna Loy. Here he plays the heavyweight champion who barely holds onto his title with a draw decision after a furious fight with Baer. The film was made just a year before Carnera fought Baer for real, in a bout that was as wild as the film version, but ended with a knockout loss for Carnera.

Carnera had a bit part in the 1949 movie &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;. He played himself in the tug-of-war scene with the giant gorilla. After being pulled by the ape into a pool of water, Carnera threw a couple of futile punches to Joe&#x27;s chin.

He also played a bully boy wrestler in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;A Kid for Two Farthings&quot; (1955). Set in London&#x27;s Petticoat Lane Market, the film pits Carnera&#x27;s character against a local bodybuilder who is to marry another character named Sonia, played by Diana Dors.

Primo appeared in at least ten Italian films between 1939 and 1943, as well as several in the 1950s, like Prince Valiant, in the role of Sligon. His last screen role was as the giant Antaeus alongside Steve Reeves in &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot; (US title, filmed in Italy, 1959, original title &quot;Ercole e la regina di Lidia&quot;).

==Professional wrestling career==
In 1945 he temporarily returned to boxing and won two fights. But the next year, after three losses against Luigi Musina his talent for wrestling was discovered. In 1946 he became a professional wrestler and was immediately a huge success at the box office. For several years he was one of the top draws in wrestling. Carnera continued to be an attraction into the 1960s. Max Baer attended at least one of Carnera&#x27;s wrestling matches.

Carnera won his debut against Jules Strongbow in Wilmington, California on 20 August 1946. Two days later, he defeated Tommy O&#x27;Toole at the Grand Olympic Auditorium before 10,000 fans. On 23 October 1946, Carnera won his 41st consecutive wrestling match by defeating Jules Strongbow. On 19 November 1946, Carnera beat Harry Kruskamp to remain undefeated at 65–0–0. Primo Carnera went 120 straight wrestling matches undefeated (119–0–1) before suffering his first loss to Yvon Robert in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 20 August 1947. Carnera&#x27;s greatest victory took place on 7 December 1947 when he defeated former world heavyweight champion Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis.

In May 1948, Carnera took a 143–1–1 record against world heavyweight champion Lou Thesz. Thesz defeated Carnera in a world title defense.

==Mob influence and suspicious matches==

According to boxing historian Herbert Goldman, Carnera was &quot;very much mob controlled.&quot; His contract was purchased by mobster Owney Madden after Carnera&#x27;s arrival in New York in 1930. Abe Attell was brought in to train Carnera. Attell had been caught up in the Black Sox Scandal. However Attell was acquitted when he successfully convinced the jury that he was the wrong Abe Attell.

Carnera met his first serious heavyweight contender, Young Stribling, in 1929, and won when Stribling fouled him. In a rematch, he fouled Stribling. Each scoring a victory by disqualification. Commenting on the unsatisfactory conclusion of the two matches, sportswriter Robert Edgren commented &quot;Stribling seems to be playing Carnera the way he has played a lot of palukas and stable mates at different towns in &quot;the sticks&quot; in this country. Always the return engagement.&quot;

In January 1930 against Big Boy Peterson, Carnera won easily in the 1st round. The New York Times noted the absence of betting on the outcome causing skepticism prior to the match. Peterson was counted out while punching himself in the jaw. &quot;Whether to make sure he was knocked out or in an effort to restore his jarred senses could not be ascertained.&quot; Boxing Commissioner James Farley, watching ringside, &quot;was not altogether satisfied with the contest&quot; but did not launch an investigation.

A week later against Elzear Rioux the fight lasted only 47 seconds and Rioux was down 6 times. Bob Soderman of the Chicago Tribune reported, &quot;Rioux didn&#x27;t do much fighting..being too intent on doing what he had been hired to do; that is, making sure he fell to the canvas at the slightest provocation.&quot; After an investigation, the Illinois Boxing Commission cleared Carnera but fined Rioux $1000 and revoked his license.

In March, 1930, Primo Carnera faced George Trafton in Kansas City. Trafton was knocked out by Carnera in the first round of their fight. In the aftermath of the fight, the Missouri Boxing Commission suspended Trafton but laid no blame on Carnera.

His April 1930 fight against California club fighter Bombo Chevalier ended when one of Chevalier&#x27;s seconds, Bob Perry, threw in the towel, although it appeared to all that the boxer was in no worse condition than Carnera. The match was found to be fixed, Carnera&#x27;s purse was initially withheld. Mrs. Chevalier told them her husband had been approached earlier to agree to a &quot;fake fight,&quot; but that he had directed all business to his manager, Tim McGrath. McGrath declared he had no knowledge that Perry was going to throw in the towel, and that the towel should not have been thrown in. Chevalier also stated that Perry had rubbed him with a sponge that caused his eyes and nose to burn.

In May 1930 the National Boxing Association suspended Carnera.

His June 1930 match against George Godfrey was controversial before it began. Seconds were forbidden from throwing in the towel. Godfrey was disqualified in the fifth round when he was clearly getting the better of Carnera. In the aftermath, Godfrey lost his boxing license and half his purse, Carnera was cleared.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine, in a 5 October 1931 cover story on Carnera before he won the heavyweight title, commented on his odd career:

==Depictions in popular culture==
===In film===
&quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;, Rod Serling&#x27;s 1956 Emmy Award-winning teleplay for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; directed by Ralph Nelson (who also won an Emmy), focused on down-and-out former heavyweight boxer Harlan &quot;Mountain&quot; McClintock. The travails of McClintock, who was played by Jack Palance (Sean Connery played the part on British television and Anthony Quinn essayed the role in the 1962 film), was thought by many boxing fans to resemble Carnera&#x27;s life.

In 1947, fighting aficionado Budd Schulberg wrote &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;, a novel about a giant boxer whose fights are all fixed. It was adapted into Mark Robson&#x27;s 1956 film, which starred Humphrey Bogart and Rod Steiger. The towel throwing controversy against Bombo Chevalier is briefly depicted. A highlight was the appearance of Max Baer, playing a fighter the mob could not fix who destroys the giant in his first fair fight. Critics drew parallels with the real-life Baer-Carnera fight two decades before. In response, Carnera unsuccessfully sued the film&#x27;s company.

Carnera played himself in the 1949 movie &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;.

Carnera was played by Matthew G. Taylor in the 2005 film &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, a film about the life of fellow boxer James J. Braddock.

In 2008, the actor Andrea Iaia played Carnera in the Italian biographical film &quot;&quot;, directed by Renzo Martinelli.

In 2013, Emporio Elaborazioni Meccaniche named a motorbike, the 1983 BMW R80RT Carnera, in honor of Carnera.

===In comics===
In 1947, &quot;Carnera&quot;, an Italian comic book series sporting a fictional version of Primo Carnera, was produced. In 1953, it was translated into German. A facsimile version was published in 2010.

Another popular Italian comic character, Dick Fulmine, was graphically inspired by Carnera.

===In literature===
Carnera is mentioned by Bertie Wooster in the 1934 novel &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, by P.G. Wodehouse on p. 234.

In his 1933 collection of short stories &quot;Mulliner Nights&quot;, Wodehouse described one character as follows: &quot;He was built on large lines, and seemed to fill the room to overflowing. In physique he was not unlike what Primo Carnera would have been if Carnera hadn&#x27;t stunted his growth by smoking cigarettes when a boy.&quot;

Carrera&#x27;s fight with Walter Neusel is described in &quot;One-storied America&quot; by Soviet authors Ilf and Petrov (1937).

Carnera is mentioned by Julian “Digger” Burroughs in the 1982 novel &quot;Lucifer’s Weekend&quot;, by Warren Murphy on p. 81.

Carnera is mentioned in the 1937 novel, The Far Distant Oxus, by Katharine Hull and Pamela Whitlock, during Bridget&#x27;s dream where their servant was a cross between &#x27;their waterboy out east and Carnera&#x27; on p. 274.

Carnera is mentioned in the 1939 pulp fiction story series Avenger #1 Justice Inc, by Kenneth Robeson on page 59, as an example of a &quot;giant&quot; as the author attempts to describe the physical stature of Algernon Smith - one of Richard Benjamin&#x27;s future crime fighting allies.

===In music===
Carnera is mentioned in &quot;Cambalache&quot;, a 1934 tango song by Enrique Santos Discépolo that was featured in the musical drama film &quot;The Soul of the Accordion&quot;.

The Yeasayer song &quot;Ambling Alp&quot;, from their 2010 album &quot;Odd Blood&quot; references Carnera by his nickname in the title and second verse. Both Carnera and German boxer Max Schmeling are referenced for their bouts with American Joe Louis.

<doc id="254847" wikidata="Q418226" url="?curid=254847" title="Mazu">
<text>Mazu or Matsu is a sea goddess in Chinese folk religion, Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. She is also known by several other names and titles. Mazu is the deified form of Lin Moniang (), a shamaness from Fujian who is said to have lived in the late 10th century. After her death, she became revered as a tutelary deity of Chinese seafarers, including fishermen and sailors. Her worship spread throughout China&#x27;s coastal regions and overseas Chinese communities throughout Southeast Asia, where some Mazuist temples are affiliated with famous Taiwanese temples. Mazu was traditionally thought to roam the seas, protecting her believers through miraculous interventions. She is now generally regarded by her believers as a powerful and benevolent Queen of Heaven.

Mazu worship is popular in Taiwan because many early Chinese settlers in Taiwan were Hoklo people from Fujian. Her temple festival is a major event in Taiwan, with the largest celebrations occurring in and around her temples at Dajia and Beigang.


==Names and titles==

In addition to Mazu or Ma-tsu, meaning &quot;Maternal Ancestor&quot; &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Granny&quot;, or &quot;Grandmother&quot;, Lin Moniang is worshipped under various other names and titles:

* Mazupo () or Ma Cho Po in Hokkien, a popular name in Fujian
* A-Ma, also spelled Ah-Ma (阿媽，&quot;Mother&quot; or &quot;Grandmother&quot;), a popular name in Macau
* Linghui Furen (&quot;Lady of Numinous Grace&quot;), an official title conferred in 1156.
* Linghui Fei (&quot;Princess of Numinous Grace&quot;), an official title conferred in 1192.
* Tianfei (&quot;Princess of Heaven&quot;, Wu Chinese: &quot;Thi-fi&quot;), fully Huguo Mingzhu Tianfei (&quot;Illuminating Princess of Heaven who Protects the Nation&quot;), an official title conferred in 1281.
* Huguo Bimin Miaoling Zhaoying Hongren Puji Tianfei (&quot;Heavenly Princess who Protects the Nation and Shelters the People, of Marvelous Numen, Brilliant Resonance, Magnanimous Kindness, and Universal Salvation&quot;), an official title conferred in 1409.
* Tianhou or Tianhou Shengmu (title used mostly in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam), also called Tin Hau in Cantonese, Thean Hou in Min Chinese and Thiên Hậu in Vietnamese (), an official title conferred in 1683.
* Tianshang Shengmu (&quot;Holy Heavenly Mother&quot;; title used mostly in Taiwan) 
* Tongxian Lingnü ()
* Shennü ()
* Zhaoxiao Chunzheng Fuji Ganying Shengfei (&quot;Holy Princess of Clear Piety, Pure Faith, and Helpful Response&quot;), an official title conferred during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming.
* Gupozu（), an unofficial title used by descendants whose surname is &quot;Lin（林）&quot;, due to sharing the same surname Lin.

Although many of Mazu&#x27;s temples honor her titles Tianhou and Tianfei, it became customary to never pray to her under those names during an emergency since it was believed that, hearing one of her formal titles, Mazu might feel obligated to groom and dress herself as properly befitting her station before receiving the petition. Prayers invoking her as Mazu were thought to be answered more quickly.

==History==

Very little is known of the historical Lin Moniang. She was apparently a shamaness from a small fishing village on Meizhou Island, part of Fujian&#x27;s Putian County, in the late 10th century. She probably did not live there, however, but on the nearby mainland. During this era, Fujian was greatly sinicized by influxes of refugees fleeing invasions of northern China and it has been hypothesised that Mazu&#x27;s cult represented a hybridization of Chinese and native indigenous culture. The earliest record of her cult is from two centuries later, an 1150 inscription that mentions &quot;she could foretell a man&#x27;s good and ill luck&quot; and, &quot;after her death, the people erected a temple for her on her home island&quot;.

==Legend==

The legends around Lin Moniang&#x27;s life were broadly established by the 12th century.

She was said to have been born under the reign of the Quanzhounese warlord Liu Congxiao (.962), in the Min Kingdom, which eventually developed into the specific date of the 23rd day of the third month of the Chinese lunar calendar in AD960, the first year of the Song. The late Ming &quot;Great Collection of the Three Teachings&#x27; Origin and Development and Research into the Divine&quot;, however, placed her birth much earlier, in 742.

The early sources speak of her as &quot;Miss Lin&quot;; her given name Mo (&quot;Silent One&quot;) or Moniang (&quot;the Silent Girl&quot;) appeared later. It was said to have been chosen when she did not cry during birth or during the first month afterwards; she remained a quiet and pensive child as late as four. She was said to have been the sixth or seventh daughter of Lin Yuan (). He is now usually remembered as one of the local fishermen, although the 1593 edition of the &quot;Records of Research into the Divine&quot; made him Putian&#x27;s chief military inspector. The family was helpful and popular within their village. Late legends intended to justify Mazu&#x27;s presence in Buddhist temples held that her parents had prayed to Guanyin for a son but received yet another daughter. In one version, her mother dreamt of Guanyin giving her a magical pill to induce pregnancy and woke to find the pill still in her hand; rather than being born in the conventional way, Mazu shot from her mother at birth in the form of a fragrant flash of red light. Guanyin was said to have been especially devoted to Mazu or even to have been incarnated as Mazu; for her part, Mazu was said to have been entranced by a statue of Guanyin at a temple she visited as a child, after which she became an ardent Buddhist.

She is now often said to have studied religious literature, mastering Confucius by 8 and the principal Buddhist sutras by 11. The &quot;Account of the Blessings Revealed by the Princess of Heaven&quot; () collected by her supposed descendants Lin Yaoyu (; ) and Lin Linchang (; ) claimed that, while still a girl, she was visited by a Taoist master (elsewhere a Buddhist monk) named Xuantong () who recognized her Buddha nature. By 13, she had mastered the book of lore he had left her () and gained the abilities to see the future and visit places in spirit without travel. She was able to manifest herself at a distance as well and used this power to visit gardens in the surrounding countryside, although she asked owners&#x27; permission before gathering any flowers to take home. Although she only started swimming at the relatively late age of 15, she soon excelled at it. She was said to have stood on the shore in red garments to guide fishing boats home, regardless of harsh or dangerous weather. She met a Taoist immortal at a fountain at sixteen and received an amulet or two bronze tablets which she translated or used to exorcize demons, to heal the sick, and to avert disasters. She was also said to be a rainmaker during times of drought.

Mazu&#x27;s principal legend concerns her saving one or some members of her family when they were caught offshore during a typhoon, usually when she was 16. It appears in several forms. In one, the women at home feared Lin Yuan and his son were lost but Mazu fell into a trance while weaving at her loom. Her spiritual power began to save the men from drowning but her mother roused her, causing her to drop her brother into the sea. The father returned and told the other villagers of the miracle; this version of the story is preserved in murals at Fengtin in Fujian. One variant is that her brothers were saved but her father was lost; she then spent three days and nights searching for his body before finding it. Another version is that all the men returned safely. Another is that Mazu was praying to Guanyin; another that she was sleeping and assisting her family through her dream. Still another is that the boats were crewed by her four brothers and that she saved three of them, securing their boats together, with the eldest lost owing to the interference of her parents, who mistook her trance for a seizure and woke her.

In earlier records, Mazu died unmarried at 27 or 28. (Her celibacy was sometimes ascribed to a vow she took after losing her brother at sea.) The date of her passing eventually became the specific date of the Double Ninth Festival in 987, making her 27 by western reckoning and 28 by traditional Chinese dating. She was said to have died in meditation, though in some accounts she did not die but climbed a mountain alone and ascended into Heaven as a goddess in a beam of bright light. In others, she died protesting an unwanted betrothal. Still another places her death at age 16, saying she drowned after exhausting herself in a failed attempt to find her lost father, underlining her filial piety. Her corpse then washed ashore on Nangan Island, which preserves a gravesite said to be hers.

==Myths==

In addition to the legends surrounding her earthly life, Mazu figures in a number of Chinese myths.

In one, the demons Qianliyan (&quot;Thousand-Mile Eye&quot;) and Shunfeng&#x27;er (&quot;Wind-Following Ear&quot;) both fell in love with her and she conceded that she would marry the one who defeated her in combat. Using her martial arts skills, however, she subdued them both and, after becoming friends, hired them as her guardian generals.

In a book of the Taoist Canon (), the Jade Woman of Marvelous Deeds () is a star from the Big Dipper brought to earth by Laojun, the divine form of Laozi, to show his compassion for those who might be lost at sea. She is incarnated as Mazu and swears not only to protect sailors but to oversee all facets of life and death, providing help to anyone who might call upon her.

==Legacy==
===Worship===

Mazuism is first attested in Huang Gongdu&#x27;s poem &quot;On the Shrine of the Smooth Crossing&quot; (), which considered her a menial and misguided shamaness whose continued influence was inexplicable. He notes that her devotees danced and sang together and with their children. Shortly afterwards, Liao Pengfei ()&#x27;s 1150 inscription at the village of Ninghai (now Qiaodou Village) in Putian was more respectful. It states that, &quot;after her death, the people erected a temple for her on her home island&quot; and that the Temple of the Sacred Mound () was raised in 1086 after some people in Ninghai saw it glowing, discovered a miraculous old raft or stump, and experienced a vision of &quot;the goddess of Meizhou&quot;. This structure had been renamed the Smooth Crossing Temple by Emperor Huizong of Song in 1123 after his envoy Lu Yundi () was miraculously saved during a storm the year before while on an official mission to pay respects to the court of Goryeo upon the death of its king, Yejong, and to replace the Liao dynasty as the formal suzerains investing his successor, Injong.

Her worship subsequently spread: Li Junfu&#x27;s early-13th century &quot;Putian Bishi&quot; records temples on Meizhou and at Qiaodou, Jiangkou, and Baihu. By 1257, Liu Kezhuang was noting Putian&#x27;s &quot;large market towns and small villages all have... shrines to the Princess&quot; and that they had spread to Fengting to the south. By the end of the Song dynasty, there were at least 31 temples to Mazu, reaching at least as far as Shanghai in the north and Guangzhou in the south.

As Mazuism spread, it began to absorb the cults of other local shamanesses such as the other two of Xianyou&#x27;s &quot;Three Princesses&quot; and even some lesser maritime and agricultural gods, including Liu Mian and Zhang the Heavenly Instructor. By the 12th century, she had already become a guardian to the people of Qiaodou when they suffered drought, flood, epidemic, piracy, or brigandage. She protected women during childbirth and assisted with conception. As the patron of the seas, her temples were among the first erected by arriving overseas Chinese, as they gave thanks for their safe passage. Despite his Islamic upbringing, the Ming admiral and explorer Zheng He credited Mazu for protecting one of his journeys, prompting a new title in 1409. He patronized the Mazu temples of Nanjing and prevailed upon the Yongle Emperor to construct the city&#x27;s Tianfei Palace; because of its imperial patronage and prominent location in the empire&#x27;s southern capital, this was long the largest and highest-status center of Mazuism in China. During the Southern Ming resistance to the Qing, Mazu was credited with helping Koxinga&#x27;s army capture Taiwan from the Dutch; she was later said to have personally aided some of Shi Lang&#x27;s men in defeating Liu Guoxuan at Penghu in 1683, ending the independent kingdom of Koxinga&#x27;s descendants and placing Taiwan under Qing control. The Ming prince Zhu Shugui&#x27;s palace was converted into Tainan&#x27;s Grand Matsu Temple, the first to bear her new title of &quot;Heavenly Empress&quot;.

In late imperial China, sailors often carried effigies of Mazu to ensure safe crossings. Some boats still carry small shrines on their bows. Mazu charms are also used as medicine, including as salves for blistered feet. As late as the 19th century, the Qing government officially credited her divine intervention with their 1884 victory over the French at Tamsui District during the Sino-French War and specially honored the town&#x27;s temple to her, which had served as General Sun Kaihua&#x27;s headquarters during the fighting. When US forces bombed Taiwan during World War II, Mazu was said to intercept bombs and defend the people.
Today, Mazuism is practiced in about 1500 temples in 26 countries around the world, mostly in the Sinosphere or the overseas Chinese communities such as that of the predominantly Hokkien Philippines. Of these temples, almost 1000 are on Taiwan, representing a doubling of the 509 temples recorded in 1980 and more than a dozen times the number recorded before 1911. These temples are generally registered as Taoist, although some are considered Buddhist. There are more than 90 Mazu Temples in Hong Kong. In Mainland China, Mazuism is formally classified as a cult outside of Buddhism and Taoism, although numerous Buddhist, Confucianist and Taoist temples include shrines to her. Her worship is generally permitted but not encouraged, with most surviving temples concentrated around Putian in Fujian. Including the twenty on Meizhou Island, there are more than a hundred in the prefecture and another 70 elsewhere in the province, mostly in the settlements along its coast. There are more than 40 temples in Guangdong and Hainan and more than 30 in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, but many historical temples are now treated as museums and operated by local parks or cultural agencies. From the early 2000s, pilgrimages from Taiwan to temples in Fujian have been permitted, particularly to the one in Yongchun, where Taiwan&#x27;s Xingang Mazu Temple has been allowed to open a branch temple. The A-Ma Temple on Macao Island is the probable source of its name in Portuguese and English; the historic and protected Tin Hau Temple, Causeway Bay in Hong Kong is the source of the Tin Hau area&#x27;s name from the Cantonese pronunciation of one of Mazu&#x27;s titles, &quot;Empress of Heaven&quot;. The Mazu temple in Melbourne is the largest Chinese temple in Australia.

A major project to build the world&#x27;s tallest Mazu statue at Tanjung Simpang Mengayau in Kudat, Borneo, was officially launched by Sabah. The statue was to be 10 stories high, but was canceled due to protests from Muslims in Sabah and political interference.

Informal centers of pilgrimage for Mazu&#x27;s believers include Meizhou Island, the Zhenlan Temple in Taichung on Taiwan, and Xianliang Temple in Xianliang Harbor, Putian. Together with Meizhou Island, the Xianliang Temple is considered the most sacred place to Mazu, whose supposed death happened on the seashore of Xianliang Harbor. A ceremony attended by pilgrims from different provinces of China and from Taiwan commemorates this legendary event each year in October. 

=== Pilgrimages ===

The primary temple festival in Mazuism is Lin Moniang&#x27;s traditional birthday on the 23rd day of the 3rd month of the Chinese lunar calendar. In Taiwan, there are two major pilgrimages made in her honor, the Dajia Mazu Pilgrimage and the Baishatun Mazu Pilgrimage. In both festivals, pilgrims walk more than 300 kilometers to carry a litter containing statues of the goddess between two temples. Another major festival is that around the Tianhou Temple in Lukang. Depending on the year, Mazu&#x27;s festival day may fall as early as mid-April or as late as mid-May.

The anniversary of her death or supposed ascension into Heaven is also celebrated, usually on the Double Ninth Festival (the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar).

==== CCP influence operations ====

The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) utilizes Mazu as a tool to advocate for Chinese unification. According to academic Chang Kuei-min of National Taiwan University, the CCP has created a narrative that it is a champion of Chinese folk religion and Mazu has become part of that narrative. In 2011, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping instructed cadres to &quot;make full use&quot; of Mazu for Chinese unification efforts. Temples in Taiwan, especially in rural areas, have been the most prominent targets for influence operations as they are meeting grounds for prominent local figures and financial donations to temples remain unregulated.

===In art===

After her death, Mazu was remembered as a young lady who wore a red dress as she roamed over the seas. In religious statuary, she is usually clothed in the attire of an empress, and decorated with accessories such as a ceremonial &quot;hu&quot; tablet and a flat-topped imperial cap (冕冠，&quot;mian&#x27;guan&quot;) with rows of beads (&quot;liu&quot;) hanging from the front and back. Her temples are usually protected by the door gods Qianliyan (千里眼) and Shunfeng&#x27;er (順風耳). These vary in appearance but are frequently demons, Qianliyan red with two horns and two yellow sapphire eyes and Shunfeng&#x27;er green with one horn and two ruby eyes.

&quot;Lin Moniang&quot; (2000), a minor Fujianese TV series, was a dramatization of Mazu&#x27;s life as a mortal. &quot;Mazu&quot; (, 2007) was a Taiwanese animated feature film from the Chinese Cartoon Production Co. depicting her life as a shamaness and goddess. Its production director Teng Chiao admitted the limited appeal to the domestic market: &quot;If young people were our primary target audience, we wouldn&#x27;t tell the story of Mazu in the first place since they are not necessarily interested in the ancient legend[;] neither do they have loyalty to made-in-Taiwan productions&quot;. Instead, &quot;when you look to global markets, the question that foreign buyers always ask is what can best represent Taiwan&quot;. &quot;Mazu&quot;, with its story about &quot;a magic girl and two cute sidekicks [Mazu&#x27;s door gods Qianliyan and Shunfeng&#x27;er] spiced up with a strong local flavor&quot;, was instead designed with an intent to appeal to international markets interested in Taiwan.

<text>Simply Smiffy is a comic strip published in the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. It is one of the many spin-off comic strips off &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot;, first appearing in issue 2254.

== Background ==
&quot;Simply Smiffy&quot; is the second &quot;Bash Street Kids&quot; spin-off that starred Smiffy, the first being &quot;Says Smiffy&quot; from 1971. It encouraged readers to mail the &quot;Beano&quot; office their ideas for new inventions, which are tested by Smiffy in the following issues. The series was illustrated by Jim Petrie and ran for over 25 issues.

== Synopsis ==
The stories are about Smiffy&#x27;s life outside of going to school, usually making mistakes because of his ditziness. It is revealed he has a brother, a bespectacled boy (who looks similar to Smiffy) named Norman, who supervises Smiffy&#x27;s antics.

== Publication history ==
Despite Jim Petrie illustrating Smiffy&#x27;s previous comic strip, &quot;Simply Smiffy&quot; was illustrated by Jerry Swaffield. It was one of the first comic strips published and approved by chief editor Euan Kerr soon after Harry Cramond&#x27;s retirement. The strips were a page long and were set in Smiffy&#x27;s home, garden, or in parks or the high street. The series ran from issue 2254 to 2338.

=== Subsequent appearances ===
&quot;Simply Smiffy&quot; returned to The Beano in the Funsize Funnies, illustrated by Paul Palmer. It also appeared in 1987 and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Beano&quot; annuals, and &quot;The Beano Summer Special&quot;s of 1986 and 1987.

<text>Rap metal is a fusion genre that combines hip hop with heavy metal. It usually consists of heavy metal guitar riffs, funk metal elements, rapped vocals and sometimes turntables.

==History==
===Origins and early development (1980s–early 1990s)===

Rap metal&#x27;s roots are based both in hip hop acts who sampled heavy metal music, such as Beastie Boys, MC Strecker Cypress Hill, Esham and Run-DMC, and rock bands who fused heavy metal and hip hop influences, such as 24-7 Spyz and Faith No More.

Scott Ian of Anthrax (who helped pioneer the genre) believes Rage Against the Machine invented the genre. 

In 1987, the heavy metal band Anthrax fused hip hop with heavy metal for their extended play &quot;I&#x27;m the Man.&quot; The next year rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot teamed up with Metal Church for his 1988 single &quot;Iron Man&quot;, from his debut album &quot;Swass&quot;, loosely based upon the Black Sabbath song of the same name. Rap metal can be found in a track from the industrial metal band Ministry in their 1989 album &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; on the track &quot;Test&quot; for which they hired rappers The Grand Wizard (K. Lite) and The Slogan God (Tommie Boyskee) to perform vocals. In 1990, the rapper Ice-T formed a heavy metal band called Body Count, and while performing at the 1991 Lollapalooza tour performed a set that was half rap songs and half metal songs. Stuck Mojo and Clawfinger, both formed in 1989, are considered to be another two pioneers of the genre. Anthrax in 1991 teamed up with Public Enemy for a remake of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; that fused hip hop with thrash metal. Also in 1991, the thrash metal band Tourniquet featured the hip hop group P.I.D. on the song &quot;Spineless&quot; from their album &quot;Psycho Surgery&quot;.

===Rise in popularity (1990s–early 2000s)===

In the 1990s, rap metal became a popular style of music. For instance, the band Faith No More&#x27;s song &quot;Epic&quot; was a major success and peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 1993 saw the release of the &quot;Judgment Night&quot; soundtrack that featured numerous collaborations between rappers, musicians and rock and metal group of bands. Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Evil Empire&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one, and in 1999, their third studio album, &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;, also debuted in top spot in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 430,000 copies in its first week. Each of the band&#x27;s albums became at least platinum hits. Biohazard played on the Ozzfest mainstage alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Slayer, Danzig, Fear Factory, and Sepultura. In support of the album, Biohazard embarked on a short co-headlining tour of Europe with Suicidal Tendencies.

On August 18, 1998, Atlantic released rap metal musician Kid Rock&#x27;s &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; behind the single &quot;Welcome 2 the Party (Ode 2 the Old School)&quot; and Kid Rock went on the Vans Warped Tour to support the album. Sales of &quot;Welcome 2 The Party&quot; and &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; were slow, though the 1998 Warped Tour in Northampton, Massachusetts stimulated regional interest in Massachusetts and New England. This led to substantial airplay of the single &quot;I Am The Bullgod&quot; during the summer and fall of 1998 on Massachusetts rock staples WZLX and WAAF. In early December 1998, while DJing at a club, he met and became friends with MTV host Carson Daly. He talked Daly into getting him a performance on MTV and on December 28, 1998, he performed on &quot;MTV Fashionably Loud&quot; in Miami, Florida, creating a buzz from his performance, even upstaging Jay-Z. In May, his sales began taking off with the third single &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; and by April 1999, &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; had achieved a gold disc. The following month, &quot;Devil&quot;, as he predicted, went platinum. Kid Rock&#x27;s first major tour was Limptropolis, where he opened for Limp Bizkit with Staind. He solidified his superstardom with a Woodstock 1999 performance and on July 24 of that year, he was double platinum. The following single &quot;Cowboy&quot;, a mix of southern rock, country, and rap, was an even bigger hit, making the Top 40. It even became the theme song of WCW&#x27;s Jeff Jarrett. Rock&#x27;s next single, the slow back porch blues ballad &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;, was the biggest hit off the album, charting at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was one of the first songs to use the autotune effect. By the time the final single, &quot;Wasting Time&quot;, was released, the album had sold 7 million copies. &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; was certified 11 times platinum by the RIAA on April 17, 2003. According to Nielsen SoundScan, as of 2013, actual sales are 9.3 million. Kid Rock was nominated as Best New Artist at the 2000 Grammy Awards, but lost to Christina Aguilera. He was nominated for &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; for Best Hard Rock Performance, but lost to Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;. In 1998, Ice Cube released his long-awaited album &quot;War &amp; Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)&quot; which had some elements of nu metal and rap metal on some tracks. The album debuted at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 180,000 copies in the first week.

It reached the height of its popularity during 1999, with the Port Huron &quot;Times-Herald&quot; describing the summer of that year as a &quot;bipolar menu of harsh rap-metal and gooey teen pop.&quot; Around this time, the style started to attract criticism in the mainstream, particularly after the troubled Woodstock 1999 festival, which featured many artists associated with rap metal and nu/alternative metal, such as Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine and Reveille. Pop punk musician Jeff Brogowski told &quot;The Morning Call&quot; newspaper in 1999 that &quot;these macho rap-metal bands are just so mean-spirited. Look what happened at Woodstock (last summer). All the violence, looting and the fires. Something strange is going on. Maybe it has something do with all the economic prosperity. It&#x27;s getting ugly like it was during the &#x27;80s, when so many people and bands were so cocky.&quot;

The nu/rap metal band Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Significant Other&quot; climbed to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release. In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies. The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;, set a record for highest week-one sales of a rock album with over one million copies sold in the U.S. in its first week of release, with 400,000 of those sales coming on its first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Vs.&quot; That same year, Papa Roach&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Infest&quot; became a platinum hit; the album later sold over 3 million copies worldwide making it the band’s most successful album to date and making Papa Roach an influential act in the nu metal scene. Cypress Hill incorporated direct heavy metal influences into their 2000 album &quot;Skull &amp; Bones&quot;, which featured six tracks in which rappers B-Real and Sen Dog were backed by a band including Fear Factory members Christian Olde Wolbers and Dino Cazares and Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk. B-Real also formed a rap metal group, Kush, with Wolbers, Fear Factory drummer Raymond Herrera and Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter. According to B-Real, Kush is more aggressive than other bands in the genre. SX-10, formed in 1996 by Sen Dog, also performs rap rock and rap metal.

In 2000, the rap metal band P.O.D.&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; went platinum and was the 143rd best-selling album of 2000. Late in 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, which remains both the best-selling debut album by any artist in the 21st century, and the best-selling nu metal album of all time. The album was also the best-selling album in all genres in 2001, offsetting sales by prominent pop acts like Backstreet Boys and N&#x27;Sync, earning the band a Grammy Award for their second single &quot;Crawling&quot;, with the fourth single, &quot;In the End&quot;, released late in 2001, becoming one of the most recognized songs in the first decade of the 21st century. The rap rock band Crazy Town also broke into the mainstream success of nu metal with their 1999 album &quot;The Gift of Game&quot;, especially their number 1 hit single, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, which peaked at number 1 on many charts including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during March 2001, remaining on the Hot 100 for 23 weeks. It also peaked at number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and the Hot Dance Singles chart as well as peaking number 6 on the Rhythmic Top 40, number 2 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart and number 4 on the Top 40 Tracks chart. Their album The Gift of Game peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Worldwide the album sold more than 2.5 million units, with more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Also that year was Saliva&#x27;s &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot; which was also a commercial success, debuting at no. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2001, the band P.O.D.&#x27;s Satellite album went triple platinum and peaked at #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

===Decline (2010s)===

Proyecto Eskhata, a Spanish band which debuted in 2012, has received much press coverage in Spain for its fusion of progressive rock and rap metal, which journalists have described as &quot;progressive rap metal&quot;.

British rapper Scarlxrd is often associated with the genre and is considered a pioneer of trap metal. WQHT described OG Maco&#x27;s 2014 eponymous EP as being a part of the genre&#x27;s early development.

<text>Pizza Haven was an Australian and New Zealand pizza restaurant chain and franchise operation.

== History ==
Founded in 1984, four brothers Evan, Louis, Bill and Gabriel Christou started Pizza Haven with the aid of a A$24,000 mortgage on their parents&#x27; home. The first Pizza Haven outlet was at Glenelg in Adelaide. Employing twelve people, the Christou brothers were active in the running of the business.

Pizza Haven evolved into a mid-sized franchised business model with approximately 180 outlets by the year 2000. A number of outlets were operated in Thailand during the mid to late 1990s.
In January 2005, the New Zealand Pizza Haven stores were bought by Domino&#x27;s Pizza. The majority were converted to Domino&#x27;s while some stores were able to stay branded under Pizza Haven. Eventually all New Zealand Pizza Haven stores became Domino&#x27;s.

In July 2008, it was announced that Pizza Haven Australia had been acquired by the Eagle Boys pizza chain (which was in turn acquired by Pizza Hut in 2016). All remaining Pizza Haven stores were eventually converted to Pizza Hut stores.

<text>An answering machine, answerphone, or message machine, also known as telephone messaging machine (or TAM) in the UK and some Commonwealth countries, ansaphone or ansafone (from a trade name), or telephone answering device (TAD), is used for answering telephone calls and recording callers&#x27; messages. 

When a telephone rings a set number of times predetermined by the call&#x27;s recipient the answering machine will activate and play either a generic announcement or a customized greeting created by the recipient. Unlike voicemail, an answering machine is placed at the user&#x27;s premises alongside—or incorporated within—the user&#x27;s landline telephone, and unlike operator messaging, the caller does not talk to a human. As landlines become less important due to the shift to cell phone technology, and as unified communications evolve, the installed base of TADs is shrinking.

== History ==
Most 20th-century answering machines used magnetic recording, which Valdemar Poulsen invented in 1898. The creation of the first practical automatic answering device for telephones, however, is in dispute. Starting in 1930, Clarence Hickman worked for Bell Laboratories, where he developed methods for magnetic recording and worked on the recognition of speech patterns and electromechanical switching systems. In 1934, he developed a tape-based answering machine which phone company AT&amp;T, as the owner of Bell Laboratories, kept under wraps for years for fear that an answering machine would result in fewer telephone calls. 

Many claim the answering machine was invented by William Muller in 1935, but it may already have been created in 1931 by William Schergens whose device used phonographic cylinders. Schergens&#x27; device is featured in Behind the Mask (1932 film). Ludwig Blattner promoted a telephone answering machine in 1929 based on his Blattnerphone magnetic recording technology. In 1935, inventor Benjamin Thornton developed a machine to record voice messages from the caller. The device reportedly also was able to keep track of the time the recordings were made. Although many sources maintain that he invented it in 1935, Thornton had actually filed a patent in 1930 (Number 1831331) for this machine, which utilized a phonographic record as the recording medium.

A commercial answering machine, the &quot;Tel-Magnet&quot;, offered in the United States in 1949, played outgoing messages and recorded incoming messages on a magnetic wire. It was priced at $200 but was not a commercial success.

In 1949, the first commercially successful answering machine was the &quot;Electronic Secretary&quot; created by inventor Joseph Zimmerman and businessman George W. Danner, who founded Electronic Secretary Industries in Wisconsin. The Electronic Secretary used the then state-of-the-art technology of a 45 rpm record player for announcements and a wire recorder for message capture and playback. Electronic Secretary Industries was purchased in 1957 by General Telephone and Electronics.
Another commercially successful answering machine was the &quot;Ansafone&quot; created by inventor Dr. Kazuo Hashimoto, who was employed by a company called &quot;Phonetel&quot;. This company began selling the first answering machines in the US in 1960. Another early model known as the Code-a-Phone was introduced in 1966.

Answering machines became more widely used after the restructuring of AT&amp;T in 1984, which was when the machines became affordable and sales reached one million units per year in the US. The first post-breakup device went by the trade name of DuoPhone and was sold by Tandy (Radio Shack). This device and its successors were designed by Sava Jacobson, an electrical engineer with a private consulting business. While early answering machines used magnetic tape technology, most modern equipment uses solid state memory storage; some devices use a combination of both, with a solid-state circuit for the outgoing message and a cassette for the incoming messages.

James P. Mitchell displayed a working prototype of a digital outgoing message with a taped incoming system at an Iowa State University VEISHEA engineering openhouse in April 1982. This system won a gold award from the Engineering department. In 1983, Kazuo Hashimoto received a patent for a &quot;digital answering machine&quot; architecture with US Patent 4,616,110. The first digital answering machine brought to the market was AT&amp;T&#x27;s Model 1337 in 1990; an activity led by Trey Weaver. Mr. Hashimoto sued AT&amp;T but quickly dropped the suit because the AT&amp;T architecture was significantly different from his patent.

== Answering and ending calls ==
There are two possibilities for answering an incoming call: (1) waiting arbitrarily long for operator intervention, or (2) automatically answering after a specified number of rings in a certain state of the TAD (e.g. &quot;toll saving&quot; below). This is useful if the owner is screening calls and does not wish to speak with all callers.

In any case after going &quot;off-hook&quot;, the calling party should be informed about the call having been answered (in most cases this starts the charging), either by some remark of the operator, or by some greeting message of the TAD, or addressed to non-human callers (e.g. fax machines) by implementing an appropriate protocol over the landline. In some cases the terminal equipment answering a call just sends a slightly modified ringback tone to the caller, while processing the protocol.

Similarly, the called equipment can end a call by going &quot;on-hook&quot; deliberately, because of some specific signalling, or because of some time out.

== Pure voice operation ==
In case of voice-only environments any accepted call can be directly handed over to a TAD, which may be preemptively superseded by a human-operated handset, taking control by simply going off-hook itself, forcing the TAD (back) on-hook. Voice signals may simply be captured to and replayed from analogue media (mostly tapes), but later TADs shifted to digital storage, with all of its convenience for compression and handling, for both the greeting and for the recorded messages.

=== Greeting message ===
Most modern answering machines have a system for greeting. The owner may record a message that will be played back to the caller, or an automatic message will be played if the owner does not record one. This holds especially for the TADs with digitally stored greeting messages or for earlier machines (before the rise of microcassettes) with a special endless loop tape, separate from a second cassette, dedicated to recording.

There have been answer-only devices with no recording capabilities, where the greeting message had to inform callers of a state of current unattainability, or e.g. about availability hours. In recording TADs the greeting usually contains an invitation to leave a message &quot;after the beep&quot;.

=== Recording messages ===
On a dual-cassette answerphone, there is an outgoing cassette, which after the specified number of rings plays a pre-recorded message to the caller. Once the message is complete, the outgoing cassette stops and the incoming cassette starts recording the caller&#x27;s message, and then stops when the caller hangs up.

Single-cassette answering machines contain the outgoing message at the beginning of the tape and incoming messages on the remaining space. They first play the announcement, then fast-forward to the next available space for recording, then record the caller&#x27;s message. If there are many previous messages, fast-forwarding through them can cause a significant delay. This delay is taken care of by playing back a beep to the caller, when the TAD is ready to record. This beep is often referred to in the greeting message, requesting that the caller leave a message &quot;after the beep&quot;.

TADs with digital storage for the recorded messages do not show this delay, of course.

=== Remote control ===
A TAD may offer a remote control facility, whereby the answerphone owner can ring the home number and, by entering a code on the remote telephone&#x27;s keypad, can listen to recorded messages, or delete them, even when away from home.

Many devices offer a &quot;toll-saver&quot; function for this purpose. Thereby the machine increases the number of rings after which it answers the call (typically by two, resulting in four rings), if no unread messages are currently stored, but answers after the set number of rings (usually two) if there are unread messages. This allows the owner to find out whether there are messages waiting; if there are none, the owner can hang up the phone on the, e.g., third ring without incurring a call charge.

Some machines also allow themselves to be remotely activated, if they have been switched off, by calling and letting the phone ring a certain large number of times (usually 10-15). Some service providers abandon calls already after a smaller number of rings, making remote activation impossible.

In the early days of TADs a special transmitter for DTMF tones (dual-tone multi-frequency signalling) was regionally required for remote control, since the formerly employed pulse dialling is not apt to convey appropriate signalling along an active connection, and the dual-tone multi-frequency signalling was implemented stepwise.

== Combined operation ==
This refers to analogue sites, which support voice, fax and data transmission via landlines by adhering to specific protocols established by the ITU-T. Any incoming call is not identifiable with respect to these properties in advance of going &quot;off hook&quot; by the terminal equipment. So after going off hook the calls must be switched to appropriate devices and only the voice-type is immediately accessible to a human, but perhaps, nevertheless should be routed to a TAD (e.g. after the caller has identified itself, or has been identified by a recognized caller ID).

Starting with the integration of faxing devices into computers via Fax modems the automated answering of voice calls by a computer went live via specific software, such as TalkWorks. These systems allowed for quite elaborate voice box systems, navigated via dual-tone multi-frequency signaling, allowing a computer on a (single) telephony line to sound like a professional telephony system with hierarchical fax and message boxes with an automatic call distributor, where a caller might deposit his messages, leave his faxes behind, might listen to specific messages, or start a fax-back service.

Besides these solutions, which primarily required a constantly running computer since a wake-on-ring function then (~1995) would take increasingly longer times to boot up an operating system, a few so-called &quot;selfmodems&quot; were available from such companies as USRobotics or ELSA Technology: the &quot;Sportster MessagePlus&quot;, the &quot;56K Message Modem External&quot;, and the &quot;MicroLink Office&quot;. These devices answered incoming calls by playing a welcome message while discriminating fax calls (CNG-tone at 1100 Hz) from voice calls, storing an incoming fax, or a voice message, respectively. A computer was only necessary afterwards to retrieve the faxes, or for storing the voice messages. In case of a full storage the devices changed their welcome message to another, prerecorded message, played upon answering an incoming call, possibly explaining that a message cannot be taken at the present time.

<doc id="254861" wikidata="Q316312" url="?curid=254861" title="Peace Sells">
<text>&quot;Peace Sells&quot; is a song by American thrash metal band Megadeth from their 1986 album &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;, written by Dave Mustaine. The song was released as the band&#x27;s second ever single in November 1986. &quot;Peace Sells&quot; was the group&#x27;s breakthrough hit, and is regarded as one of the best songs in the history of heavy metal. Since 1985, the song has since been a constant at Megadeth concerts. According to David Ellefson, it became quickly apparent when playing the song live prior to recording the album that &quot;Peace Sells&quot; would be a hit. In 2006, VH1 ranked &quot;Peace Sells&quot; at number 11 on their list of the &quot;40 Greatest Metal Songs&quot; of all time. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song number nineteen on their list on the 100 greatest heavy metal songs.

The song is also known for the distinctive bass intro played by Ellefson. The video for the track became an MTV mainstay and the bassline was used as the introduction to MTV News. However, Mustaine proclaimed that they received no royalties because the song was excluded shortly before MTV would have to pay them for its use.

== Background ==

=== Lyrics ===

&quot;Peace Sells&quot; reflects band frontman Dave Mustaine&#x27;s political and social beliefs. The title of the song was taken from a copy of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; that Mustaine saw, which had a story written by Patti Smith with the words &quot;Peace sells, but nobody&#x27;s buying it&quot;. Band drummer Gar Samuelson encouraged Mustaine to write more political lyrics in his songs, which in turn helped the song be a success. The lyrics for the song were written on the wall of the bands rehearsal space, due to Mustaine not having a pen or paper to write with. The song dispels stereotypes of metal fans that were pushed by the media throughout the &#x27;80s.

=== Music ===
The bass intro for &quot;Peace Sells&quot; was written by Mustaine. Ellefson had a BC Rich Eagle bass that he had removed the frets from. When Mustaine saw it, he grabbed the bass and almost immediately wrote the intro. Later that day, the two met up with Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland, where the song would be fully fleshed out. The original version spanned over eight minutes, and was written in only a few hours. Samuelson suggested that the song be shortened, saying &quot;This song&#x27;s too good to draw it out like that. We&#x27;ve gotta make this song short and sweet.&quot;

The second half of the song bumps up the tempo and speeds through to the end. It has more guitar solos from Poland, and features Ellefson adding a high harmony to Mustaines main vocal refrain.

== Music video ==
A music video was produced for the song, which was the band&#x27;s first ever (Wake Up Dead, the lead single, only got a video after its UK release). The video was directed by artist Robert Longo and edited by artist Gretchen Bender. The video includes a dramatic pause in the middle of the song. The interstitial features a teenage boy, wearing a Slayer T-shirt, watching a montage of live Megadeth performances and war footage on his living room television set. The boy&#x27;s father, states &quot;What is this garbage you&#x27;re watching? I want to watch the news!,&quot; and changes the television channel to a news station using the remote control. His son, replying with &quot;This &quot;is&quot; the news!,&quot; changes it back to the Megadeth performance using the TV set&#x27;s channel knob. This part of the video was parodied by comedian Brian Posehn in his &quot;Metal by Numbers&quot; video. The beginning of the video also showed the explosion of the original low-cost skull used on the cover of the previous album, &quot;Killing is My Business... and Business is Good!&quot;.

The video is recognized as one of the main reasons the band broke into the mainstream.

Due to the flashing images near the end, the video was banned in the UK.

== Live performance ==
On July 14, 1999, Samuelson died of liver failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida. Eleven days later, during Megadeth&#x27;s performance at Woodstock &#x27;99, Mustaine dedicated &quot;Peace Sells&quot; to Samuelson&#x27;s memory.

<doc id="254865" wikidata="Q5328000" url="?curid=254865" title="East Cape War">
<text>The East Cape War, sometimes also called the East Coast War, was a series of conflicts fought in the North Island of New Zealand from April 1865 to October 1866 between colonial and Māori military forces. At least five separate campaigns were fought in the area during a period of relative peace in the long-running 19th century New Zealand Wars.

The east coast hostilities came at the close of the Waikato wars and before the outbreak of Te Kooti&#x27;s War, both fought nearby, but sprang from causes more closely related to the Second Taranaki War—namely, Māori resentment of punitive government land confiscation coupled with the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the Pai Marire religion (also called the Hauhau), which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity.

Pai Mārire arrived on the east coast from Taranaki about 1865. The subsequent ritual killing of missionary Carl Volkner by Pai Mārire followers at Ōpōtiki on 2 March 1865 sparked settler fears of an outbreak of violence and later that year the New Zealand government launched a lengthy expedition to hunt for Volkner&#x27;s killers and neutralise the movement&#x27;s influence. Rising tensions between Pai Mārire followers and conservative Māori led to a number of wars between and within Māori &quot;iwi&quot;, with &quot;kūpapa&quot; or &quot;loyal&quot; Māori armed by the government in a bid to exterminate the movement.

Major conflicts within the campaign included the cavalry and artillery attack on Te Tarata pā near Ōpōtiki in October 1865 in which about 35 Māori were killed and the seven-day siege of Waerenga-a-Hika in November 1865. The government, claiming that one of Volkner&#x27;s killers was being given sanctuary by Māori in the remote Urewera region, confiscated northern parts of the Urewera land in January 1866 in a bid to break down Māori resistance and confiscated additional land in Hawke&#x27;s Bay a year later after a rout of a Māori party it deemed to pose a threat to the settlement of Napier. In 2013 the Crown paid $23 million in financial redress and expressed &quot;profound regret&quot; over the &quot;unjust attacks&quot; in Hawke&#x27;s Bay in 1866 and apologised for subsequent land confiscations.

==Background==

In 1863 the government enacted laws to confiscate the land of Māori deemed to have been &quot;in rebellion&quot; against the government in the land wars. The laws were aimed at punishing Māori for their aggression and also establishing law, order and peace by using areas within the confiscated land to establish settlements for colonisation. From early 1865 the government began confiscating wide areas of Taranaki and Waikato, depriving Māori of their food sources and livelihood. In many parts of the North Island, the resultant resentment and anger found expression in the more radical, nationalistic elements of Pai Mārire, which sought to drive European settlers from the land.

Pai Mārire had begun in Taranaki as a peaceful religion, a combination of Christianity and traditional Māori beliefs, but by 1865 had developed a reputation as a violent and vehemently anti-Pākehā (European) movement. The arrival and rapid spread of Pai Mārire in the East Cape destabilised the region, dividing Māori communities and also causing great alarm among New Zealand settlers despite the fact the area was almost devoid of European settlement. The government responded with several ad hoc measures, including supplying arms to &quot;loyal&quot; factions, organising a force of Arawa tribesmen under European leaders, and a series of small expeditions of volunteer settlers from Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

===Killing of Carl Volkner===
In early 1865 Pai Mārire leader Te Ua Haumēne sent two prophets, Kereopa Te Rau and Patara Raukatauri, to convert East Coast tribes. Kereopa, an ageing veteran of the Waikato wars, carried with him the head of Captain P.W.J. Lloyd, who had been killed in the Ahuahu attack of April 1864 in Taranaki. Kereopa had lost his family in the bloody British raid on Rangiaowhia the previous year and blamed much of the massacre of women and children on missionary complicity, so he and his followers sought &quot;utu&quot;, or revenge, against missionaries. In Whakatane he demanded that Ngāti Awa &quot;iwi&quot; hand over the local Roman Catholic priest; without waiting for a result the pair continued on to Ōpōtiki, where they succeeded in winning the allegiance of local Māori from the Whakatohea &quot;iwi&quot; to the Pai Mārire creeds. German-born Lutheran missionary Carl Sylvius Volkner, who had lived in Ōpōtiki for four years, was absent in Auckland and Patara, believing the cleric was acting as a government spy, wrote him a letter stating that missionaries would henceforth not be permitted to live among Māori and ordered him not to return. Ignoring warnings that his life was in danger, Volkner sailed back to Ōpōtiki, arriving on 1 March. The schooner was looted and Volkner and another missionary, Thomas Grace, were taken captive. The following day Volkner was hanged, then beheaded. In a church service that followed, Kereopa swallowed Volkner&#x27;s eyes—momentarily choking on one of them—and passed around a chalice containing the missionary&#x27;s blood for it to be consumed by his congregation. Grace remained captive for two weeks before escaping.

A poorly-armed Māori party led by chiefs including Ropata Wahawaha mounted an unsuccessful raid on Pai Mārire adherents at Mangaone, near Pukemaire, on 10 June 1865. After several more small engagements in the Waiapu Valley a delegation of east coast chiefs led by Mokena Kohere appealed to Donald McLean, the new Provincial Superintendent of Hawke&#x27;s Bay, for arms and reinforcements to subdue the uprising. McLean immediately supplied Mokena with weapons and ammunition, then dispatched about 100 Colonial Defence Force troops under Major James Fraser. landed the troops at Hicks Bay and at the mouth of the Waiapu River on 5 July 1865 in a bid to capture Kereopa and Patara, shelling their Hauhau enemy the next day. When a trading cutter following the troops anchored off Whakatane on 22 July to allow surveyor and government interpreter James Fulloon to go ashore to investigate the local mood, it was boarded by Pai Mārire converts at the orders of Taranaki prophet Horomona. Fulloon and two of its crew were shot and killed and the vessel&#x27;s mast was taken ashore and erected as a &quot;niu&quot; or sacred pole for Pai Mārire rites.

==East Coast expedition==
In Auckland, fears grew that the spread of Pai Mārire could unite tribes against settlers in a tide of religious fanaticism. The problem posed a major challenge for the cash-starved government which, already under pressure from London to release British troops for overseas deployment, had deployed the bulk of available forces in Taranaki and Wanganui, where much of their foe was also aligned with Pai Mārire. Without informing the British commander in New Zealand, General Duncan Cameron, Governor George Grey delegated large powers to McLean to use friendly Māori and local volunteers to put down disturbances and punish Volkner&#x27;s killers.

Fraser&#x27;s force continued to strike at Pai Mārire villages through July and August with further significant help from Ropata: 25 enemy were killed and about 30 prisoners taken in a raid on Pa-kairomiromi in the Waiapu basin on 2 August, while eight of Fraser&#x27;s men were wounded. The captured stockade was then burned. When Pai Mārire forces launched an unsuccessful raid on a loyalist Māori &quot;pā&quot; at Tokomaru Bay under the control of Ngāti Porou chief Henare Potae, Henare requested help from Ropata, who led a reprisal raid on two nearby Pai Mārire positions, Pukepapa and Tautini &quot;pā&quot;. Though outnumbered 500 to 200, Ropata captured the positions, then used a revolver to execute prisoners from his own tribe who had converted to the religion. On 18 August at a &quot;pā&quot; between Tokomaru and Tolaga Bay a heavily outnumbered force of 36 men under Henare Potae was reinforced by another 90 under Ropata in a sharp and bloody engagement. Twelve of the Pai Mārire were killed, prompting survivors to abandon the East Cape region and flee south to the Waerengaahika &quot;pā&quot; in the Turanganui (Poverty Bay) region.

On 2 September 1865 the government declared martial law on the east coast and announced a new expedition against Volkner&#x27;s killers, threatening confiscation of land in the area if they were not handed over. The expedition was an entirely colonial force, consisting of Taranaki Military Settlers, Wanganui and Patea Rangers, Wanganui Yeomanry Cavalry, and the Wanganui Native Contingent under Major Thomas McDonnell, and all under the overall command of Major Willoughby Brassey. The 500 troops sailed from Wellington and Wanganui and rendezvoused off Hicks Bay on 7 September, joining additional troops who had sailed from Auckland, including former Forest Ranger commander Major Gustavus von Tempsky.

A small initial landing force came under fire as it attempted to land in gale-force winds and was reinforced with the remainder of the troops the next morning, driving the Māori defenders several kilometres inland. Eight Whakatohea Māori were killed in the two-day clash.

The expeditionary force remained in Ōpōtiki for several weeks, converting Volkner&#x27;s church into a redoubt and engaging in occasional clashes with Māori, who established the entrenched and palisaded Te Puia pā about 8 km inland. On 4 October McDonnell led a force to Te Tarata, a new pā about 6 km from Ōpōtiki. When the force came under heavy fire, McDonnell sent for cavalry and artillery reinforcement, who surrounded the pā on three sides and began shelling it. As Māori reinforcements began arriving from nearby Te Puia, the cavalry charged through them with swords, killing and wounding about 20. McDonnell&#x27;s forces maintained heavy fire on Te Tarata past nightfall. About 8 pm a member of the Whakatohea garrison called out, asking for terms of surrender. McDonnell told them Volkner&#x27;s killers would be tried and the rest would be prisoners of war. The garrison requested an hour&#x27;s truce while they considered the request, but under cover of darkness launched a breakout, rushing the Rangers while firing their shotguns, then engaging in hand-to-hand battle with revolvers and tomahawks. About 35 Māori were killed and 35 wounded, and three of the colonial forces killed. The East Coast Expedition, now under the control of Major Charles Stapp, moved its base to the captured Te Puia and the Whakatohea fell back to new strongholds in the Waioeka Gorge. Soon after about 200 of the Ngati-Rua &quot;hapu&quot; of Whakatohea surrendered to Stapp; Ngati-Ira, under Hira Te Popo, remained hostile.

In mid-October McDonnell commanded a three-day expedition in which a force of 150 marched into the Waimana Valley in a bid to capture Kereopa and his followers. Early on 20 October the force reached Koingo, a small village on the Waimana River and set up an ambush of a track; Kereopa was targeted but escaped, although five others accompanying him were shot. Troops then raided the village, killing three Urewera and Ngai Tama Māori and capturing several others. The East Coast Expedition&#x27;s activities continued till November, prompting the surrender of more Māori including a chief, Mokomoko, whose rope had been used in Volkner&#x27;s hanging; he was later tried and hanged in Auckland. Another 18 were also tried.

In November 1865 the Native Contingent returned to Major-General Trevor Chute&#x27;s west coast campaign, while the Rangers and 1st Waikato Militia remained in occupation of Ōpōtiki; the Patea Rangers were recalled to the west coast in May 1866.

==Pukemaire==
In mid-August 1865 an East Coast Field Force, including members of the Waikato Militia, was formed under the command of Major Willoughby Brassey. Supplemented by volunteers recruited in Napier by Captain Charles Westrup, the force sailed on HMS &quot;Brisk&quot; to Gisborne, where they built a redoubt, before continuing on 30 September to Waiapu, near East Cape, to reinforce Fraser&#x27;s force.

The two groups—which, with additional support from Ngāti Porou under Ropata totaled 380 men—marched against Pukemaire on 3 October in heavy rain, facing a garrison estimated to be about 400. They opened a flying sap and managed to destroy part of the frail palisade but abandoned attempts to storm the pa when rain rendered their weapons ineffectual. Nine Pai Marire and two government soldiers were reported killed in the engagement. Forces returned to the pa on the night of 8 October ready for a renewed attack but found it deserted. The pa was later burned.

Their quarry established a new stronghold at Hungahunga-toroa, 30 km north of the pa. In October Ropata and Lieutenant Reginald Biggs led a small force, including Forest Rangers, to the new Pai Marire base, scaling nearby cliffs to launch an effective sniping operation, killing 20 occupants and wounding others. About 500 Ngāti Porou occupants of the pa surrendered and were marched to Waiapu where they were ordered to take an oath of allegiance to the Queen and to salute the Union Jack.

==Siege of Waerenga-a-Hika==

In late October 1865 McLean began planning an expedition against the Waerenga-a-Hika pā—a Pai Mārire community about 11 km from the European settlement at Turanga (modern-day Gisborne)—where several hundred men, as well as women and children, had sought refuge from the east coast wars. Other Pai Mārire converts occupied two fortified villages further inland, Pukeamionga and Kohanga-Karearea. McLean raised 300 volunteers from loyal Ngāti Porou, who were taken by steamer to Poverty Bay, where they were joined by a mixed force of Hawke&#x27;s Bay Cavalry, Military Settlers and the East Cape expeditionary force under Fraser and Biggs, who were landed from the &quot;Brisk&quot;. McLean sent an ultimatum to the pā with a list of demands: all Māori were to take an oath of allegiance to the Queen, all who had &quot;fought against the Government&quot; were to be surrendered, everyone who did not belong to the district be expelled, and that all arms were to be surrendered. McLean warned that if the terms were not complied with, they would be attacked and deprived of their homes. Though some signed the oath of allegiance, most ignored the demands and on 16 November, when the ultimatum expired, McLean directed Fraser to begin the attack.

The government force, comprising up to 200 Europeans and 300 Māori, moved on Waerenga-a-Hika on 16 November and took up positions on three sides of the pā, which had a swampy lagoon to the rear, and began a seven-day siege. The site had three lines of defence—an outer two-metre-high stockade, a main fence three metres high and a 1.5-metre-high earth breastwork. While snipers fired at the pā from the roof of a mission station about 300 metres away, the Colonial Defence Force and Military settlers dug in behind a hawthorn hedge that provided cover from two faces of the pā, and the Forest Rangers took up a position near the lagoon. A squad of 30 Military Settlers began a sap towards the north face of the stockade and neared it before coming under attack from Pai Mārire reinforcements from one of the other villages on 18 November. The European force retreated to the main body in a charge with fixed bayonets, but suffered six fatalities as well as another five wounded.

The following day, a Sunday, Pai Mārire fighters were driven off after advancing on the government soldiers in three groups in an action that left between 34 and 60 Māori dead, although there are conflicting accounts of the engagement. According to historian James Cowan, the Pai Mārire warriors held a ceremony at their sacred &quot;niu&quot; pole before forming three groups and charging the European forces behind the hawthorn hedge, with each warrior holding up their right hand, palm outwards, apparently to ward off enemy bullets. The force reached the hedge, firing as they ran, but were repulsed at almost point-blank range in a barrage that left 60 Māori dead. One European suffered a leg wound. In Fraser&#x27;s account of the same events, the armed Pai Mārire force advanced from the pā under a white flag of truce, which Fraser viewed as a ruse, &quot;as no flag of truce should be respected carried by such a large body of armed men, and I ordered them to be fired on before they could come up to us ... the enemy were totally defeated, with the loss of 34 killed, and at least that number wounded, their men falling in all directions as they attempted to regain their pa&quot;.

On 22 November, after a week of constant rifle fire, Fraser turned to artillery to end the siege, loading shrapnel-filled salmon tins into a six-pounder cannon from the &quot;Sturt&quot; to create makeshift canister shot. After two rounds were fired into the pā the demoralised garrison hoisted a white flag and 400 occupants surrendered; they were taken to Gisborne to be either released or shipped to the Chatham Islands for imprisonment. The pā was destroyed. Total Pai Mārire losses from the siege were more than 100 dead and 100 wounded, while government losses totaled 11 dead and 20 wounded. A memorial in Makaraka Cemetery in Gisborne records the names of six Hawke&#x27;s Bay Military Settlers who died on 18 November during the siege.

Among the &quot;kūpapa&quot; at Waerenga-a-Hika was future Māori guerrilla leader Te Kooti, who was taken prisoner (but later released) on suspicion of treachery after allegations that he was collaborating with the enemy and firing blanks.

==Wairoa expeditions to Waikaremoana==

Despite a general surrender at the fall of Waerenga-a-Hika on 22 November, Pai Mārire reinforcements from Turanganui, who had arrived with chiefs Anaru Matete and Te Waru Tamatea during the siege to battle Fraser&#x27;s forces, were able to escape. A group of about 100 men fled to the upper Wairoa with Anaru, while others went further inland to Waikaremoana in the Urewera mountains. On 25 December Anaru&#x27;s force was attacked at Omaruhakeke by a pursuing force and then fled to Waikaremoana. On 2 January 1866 the government expedition moved up the Waikaretaheke River, over-running the Tukurangi pā, whose occupants fled across Lake Waikaremoana, taking every canoe with them. The pursuing force reported that it destroyed &quot;no fewer than ten settlements&quot; near Waikaremoana, burning property and taking cattle and horses.

In early January McLean sent a messenger to Waikaremoana chiefs demanding that they abandon &quot;Hauhauism&quot;, deliver up their arms and hand themselves in to swear the oath of allegiance if they wished to spare their lives. The messenger was taken prisoner and later killed and decapitated.

On 10 January 1866 a second government expedition, then unaware of the fate of the messenger, set out for Lake Waikaremoana to enforce McLean&#x27;s demand. The force of 520, under Fraser&#x27;s command, was mostly &quot;kupapa&quot; Māori—the majority Ngāti Kahungunu but also a contingent of Ngāti Porou. Two days later they captured a near-empty Pai Mārire pā about 20 km up the Waikaretaheke River, but soon after realised they had been lured into a trap when they were ambushed from hidden rifle pits in the ridges overlooking the track. Fraser&#x27;s force repulsed the attack, setting fire to dry fern to drive about 150 of the ambush force—a third of them with horses—out of their cover and down to the lake&#x27;s southern shore at Onepoto, where many fled across the lake on canoe. Fourteen of Fraser&#x27;s force were killed in the attack and up to 30 wounded, but the allied force killed between 25 and 60 of the Pai Mārire Māori and took 14 prisoners, including five women. Three days later at Onepoto, Ropata seated four of his prisoners in a row—one of them the most senior chief of the upper Wairoa—and executed them with revolver. Binney has claimed Fraser sanctioned the executions, as he had a similar execution at Pukepapa pā near Tokomaru Bay in August 1865.

McLean, meanwhile, continued to hunt for Kereopa. Convinced the Urewera people were giving him sanctuary, McLean declared they were rebelling against the government and on 17 January 1866 the government proclaimed the confiscation of all the low-lying and relatively fertile lands at the northern edges of the Urewera. Binney concluded: &quot;From the government&#x27;s perspective, the &#x27;sanctuary&#x27; of the Urewera had to be broken open. Therefore, its people had to be broken; the most direct way to break them was to take their land.&quot;

Confronted with difficult terrain and a general European ignorance of the Urewera region to which most of the survivors fled, the government abandoned plans for a full-scale military invasion and opted to send more &quot;kupapa&quot; forces into the area on scouting missions, unaccompanied by European officers. On 16 March an exploratory expedition led by Pitiera Kopu set out from Wairoa, reached Onepoto three days later and immediately claimed its first victims. The expedition raided a camp of about 60 people, most of whom escaped. Three of their quarry were killed, with one elderly chief executed by Kopu; McLean viewed that execution as a reprisal for the earlier killing of his envoy to the Waikaremoana chiefs.

In mid-April, a second &quot;kupapa&quot; expedition was dispatched to the area to capture Anaru, who was said to be returning to Ruatahuna. The force split into several detachments to scour the country; on 24 April they took 30 prisoners and by early May they had taken 260 captives, including women. Some remained prisoners, others were freed after taking the oath of allegiance and 16 were sent to the Chatham Islands, where Pai Mārire captives were being sent in batches throughout 1866. Te Waru and about 15 others surrendered on 9 May and took the oath of allegiance in McLean&#x27;s presence.

==Omarunui and Petane==

In September 1866 a party of 80 men from the Ngāti Hineuru &quot;iwi&quot;—whose main villages were at Te Haroto and Tarawera, midway between Napier and Taupō—marched towards Napier, accompanied by another 20 Māori from elsewhere in the North Island. Two months earlier their chiefs had written to McLean, the Crown&#x27;s chief land purchase agent and the senior Crown official in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, responding to his invitation to negotiate peace terms and advising that they would lead a party to Napier to meet him. The chiefs also held grievances over previous land sales in the area which they wished to discuss. The party, led by Pai Mārire prophet Panapa and chiefs Nikora, Kipa, Kingita and Petera Kahuroa, as well as Ngāti Tuwharetoa chief Te Rangitahau, stayed for several weeks at Petane, north of Napier. On 4 October most of the party moved to the village of Omarunui, about 10 km southwest of Napier, while the original occupants moved out. McLean, alerted to their arrival at Omarunui, sent a messenger on 5 October demanding that they explain their intentions and over the following three days the chiefs wrote to McLean indicating they wished to take meet him. On 8 October, concluding they were a threat to the Napier settlement, McLean warned the Omarunui encampment that they should return home or they would be attacked.

McLean instructed retired Colonel George Whitmore, a Crimean War veteran and Hawke&#x27;s Bay settler, to call out 130 Hawke&#x27;s Bay Militia for active service, drill them for action and join 45 Napier Rifle Volunteers who were also placed on alert. McLean requested further assistance from Fraser, who arrived in Napier on 11 October with 40 Military Settlers and a party of Wairoa &quot;kupapa&quot;. The entire force was placed under Whitmore&#x27;s command.

About midnight on 11 October Whitmore and Fraser both marched out of Napier in separate directions: Whitmore with 180 settlers and 200 &quot;kupapa&quot; headed west, reaching and surrounding the Omarunui settlement before daybreak, while Fraser&#x27;s detachment of about 40 men went north to Petane to intercept an expected advance on Napier led by Ngāti Hineuru chief Te Rangihiroa.

At Omarunui, Whitmore sent a messenger into the unfortified pā to demand their surrender within an hour; when the deadline passed with no response Whitmore&#x27;s force launched an attack on the village, with soldiers approaching it across a stream and up a high bank—an advance watched silently and without reaction from the occupants. Whitmore&#x27;s force opened fire, quickly cutting down the occupants of the pā, whom it outnumbered almost four to one. In a firefight that lasted about an hour, Whitmore&#x27;s force killed about 31 Ngāti Hineuru, wounded 28 (of whom many later died in hospital) and captured 44 others who attempted to flee, thus accounting for almost all the occupants. Among those killed was Panapa, the prophet. The dead were buried in a mass grave; a Ngāti Hineuru chieftainess was named Ruahuihui (&quot;crowded in a pit&quot;) in memory of the event. Most of the prisoners were deported to the Chatham Islands, where they subsequently joined Te Kooti. Whitmore&#x27;s casualties amounted to two killed and 14 wounded.

Fraser&#x27;s detachment, meanwhile, intercepted a 25-man mounted party accompanying Te Rangihiroa through a narrow pass at Petane. Heavily outnumbered, the Ngāti Hineuru party was quickly stopped in its tracks: Te Rangihiroa and 11 others were killed, one was wounded and three taken prisoner. The remainder escaped. One of Fraser&#x27;s men was wounded in the attack. Most of the prisoners in the campaign were transported without trial to the Chatham Islands to be held in harsh conditions for the next two years. In January 1867 the government confiscated the so-called Mohaka-Wakare district under the New Zealand Settlements Act as punishment for the &quot;rebellion&quot; in the Omarunui and Petane areas.

==Crown apology==

In 2013 the Crown apologised for the injustices involved in Hawke&#x27;s Bay land dealings, the &quot;unreasonable ultimatum&quot; at Omarunui and the raids, killings and incarcerations that followed. The apology also included the 1867 land confiscations and the subsequent &quot;devastating impact&quot; and long-last poverty that resulted. The Crown agreed to pay $23 million as financial redress.

A separate 2013 Waitangi Tribunal report said the action of Crown forces on the East Coast from 1865 to 1869—the East Coast War and the start of Te Kooti&#x27;s War—resulted in the deaths of proportionately more Māori than in any other district during the New Zealand wars. It condemned the &quot;illegal imprisonment&quot; of a quarter of the area&#x27;s adult male population at the Chatham Islands and said the loss in war of an estimated 43 percent of the male population, many through acts of &quot;lawless brutality&quot;, was a stain on New Zealand&#x27;s history and character.
